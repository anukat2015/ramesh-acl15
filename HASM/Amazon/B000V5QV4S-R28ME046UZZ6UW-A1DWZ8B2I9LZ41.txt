I upgraded from a Rebel Xti and let me tell you, it was the best decision I made.  The value that Amazon.com offers is seriously unbeatable.  The quality of the camera is beyond my expectation and durability is wonderful.  If you are an amature, semi pro, or just a photo is a hobby, then by all means purchase this camera.  For the value and quality you cannot go wrong here!

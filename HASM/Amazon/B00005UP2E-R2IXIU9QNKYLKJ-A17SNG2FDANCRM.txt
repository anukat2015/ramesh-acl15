Title: Dirt Devil Breeze
Content:
I bought this to replace my dirt devil that burned out. It was twenty years old. I use this for my car, my widows my furniture, base boards. I have a Kirby for home use and it is to heavy for some everyday things. The dirt devil and always been a good reliable second vacuum. I can say if I get the years of use out of this one that I did my old one that it will be great. I used it today in my car and it had lots of power. I am pleased.

Title: Product is bad... customer service is non-existent!!!  :o(
Content:
This product is horrible!  I own mine for approximately 6 months or so.  As others have mentioned, there is a nasty smell emitted when you use it and there is NO storage for the accessories.
MY problem is that the battery no longer charges.  I followed directions not to leave it on the charger all the time in order to prolong battery life.  I would use it a few times before recharging.  Eventually, I had to recharge it after each use.  NOW, the battery does not charge at all!
I have tried many times to contact customer service via email.  Never received a response!  I have tried to contact customer service via telephone.  A receptionist answers and says she is transferring to customer service, but no one picks up the phone.
I would personally recommend staying AWAY from this product!

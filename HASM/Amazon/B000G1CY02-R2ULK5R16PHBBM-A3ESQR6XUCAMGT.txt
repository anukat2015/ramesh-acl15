Title: Nice for sitting near
Content:
We bought this heater to keep our legs warm while sitting at a desk. It is short enough to fit under the desk with a little clearance. On low, it is pleasant to sit near. The heater warms up quickly. The cord is of adequate length. The controls are simple and intuitive--no cheesy digital display. The unit is light, has wheels, and moves easily. It is silent and odor-free. There is no fan.

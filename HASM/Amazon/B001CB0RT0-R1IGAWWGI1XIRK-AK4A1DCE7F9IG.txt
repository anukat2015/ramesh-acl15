Title: Excellent value
Content:
Telling by today's market share, chances are you are reading this review because you are comparing the Zen to an Apple iPod product. Having switched from an iPod to the Zen X-Fi, I can say that the bottom line is the value. You get a lot for the money here.
My profile as a user is: I buy DRM-free music on Amazon and also rip my own CDs. I am an audio podcast addict and would occasionally watch a video podcast. I listen to the radio a lot.
If you only listen to music, i think that now that iTunes is finally DRM-free, there is not much value for you in the extra features here (except for maybe the internal speaker) vs the iPod.
Strengths:
- built-in radio
- superb noise-isolating headphones included
- built-in speakers
- internal mic
- great sound quality
- excellent video quality and size
- drag and drop easy file transfer from desktop to player
- battery life is unbelievably long
So overall you get a ton for your money.
Cons:
- wifi benefits are extremely limited. I don't use it at all.
- navigation not nearly as sexy or convenient as the iPod (dial or touch)
- zencast (podcast sync) organizer works fine, but not as slick as iTunes
- while creating playlists with the desktop software is easy, it's very hard to create one on the go

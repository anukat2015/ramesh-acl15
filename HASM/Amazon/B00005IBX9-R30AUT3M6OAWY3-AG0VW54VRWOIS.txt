Title: perfect cup of coffee
Content:
I bught this coffee maker for 67.99 on a different site but it is the best coffee maker ever. I also went back and got one for my daughter. I have never tasted coffee like it I thought all makers were the same boy ws I wrong. The filters really make a difference. I would however recommend shopping around.You can get it retail at Mervyns or May Co. for 99.00 so you really aren't saving any money buying it with amazon. I have really been doing some shopping lately and amazon prices are so far off the mark I am wondering why everyone is still buying from them. It isn't just one or two items it has been 20 different items that I have shopped since Christmas.Please get out and go shopping.

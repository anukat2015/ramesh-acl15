Title: Even better than the unibody aluminum MacBook Pros
Content:
This is by far one of the best laptops ever made by Apple, in terms of design, ergonomics, and performance. If you are a programmer or need to type a lot, you will soon realize that the keyboard on these machines are incomparably better than the new aluminum unibody MacBook Pros. The non-glare LCD screen is also much nicer to work when there are background lights. I simply cannot stand the glare on the new shiny screen. I hope Apple soon realizes that the shiny screens, although higher in contrast, are not preferred by most professional users.

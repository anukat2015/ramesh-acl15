Title: roasts you
Content:
I'm a heater finatic. I refuse to heat my whole house if I dont have to. I have a gas log fireplace thats pretty good and gas heat. I find that if i set my gas heat thermostat to 69 i'm not satisfied even if i'm running the fireplace. 
That being said. during the day when i'm around and about I leave the furnace at 66 just enough to keep the edge off. We kick the fireplace on as needed now and then. 
Now with the kerosene heater I kick it on and very quickly it will raise my house to about 74 75 degrees. (I have 3400 sqft home) all the down stairs and the majority of the upstairs is pretty darn toasty once you kick this thing on. 
The smell issue i suppose is an issue but its a small price to pay for comfort especially since you hardly notice it after a while. I noticed I saved money too on my utility bills. Not a ton as I still ran my furnace at night while i slept. But I also enjoyed a nice nice comfortable amount  of heat I didnt get to enjoy last year. Part of me is pondering getting another one and utilizing this form of heat more often maybe eliminate my gas heat all together. I might just see how it goes during the rougher months see how much fuel this thing sux up then and how much more i save or how toasty warm i am.
All and all I do like it. Sure its troublesome filling. But like they say with wood. "He who cuts his own wood heats himself twice" same is true for kerosene by the time you fill your warm once you light it your even warmer.
I like it. Besides if power goes out etc.. I'll still be toasty its a good alternative too a woodstove for now I think ultimatly I'd like a nice wood stove.

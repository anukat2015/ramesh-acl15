Title: So Far, a terrific maker for the $.
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for about a month now and have enjoyed terrific 'everyday' coffee since.  The coffee brews quickly to a perfect temperature, stays hot in the carafe for a reasonably long time and produces great flavor for a reasonably priced maker. It is taller than most pots but knew that at time of purchase and has not been a problem for me, and since I keep it in a corner the controls on the side work for me also.  The pour spout is great-NO DRIPS! (which is a problem with a lot of other carafes).  The paper cone filters do fit a little awkward but have not caused any problems with the brewing.  I would highly recommend this coffee maker.
Added note:  Kudos to Amazon for handling a glitch they had with my order and upgrading my shipping so that I still got the order quickly.  Good business = happy customer.

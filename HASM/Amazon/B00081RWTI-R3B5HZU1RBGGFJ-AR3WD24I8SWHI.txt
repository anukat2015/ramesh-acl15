Title: After one year...
Content:
I put this coffee maker on my Christmas list last year and was excited to try it out because a friend had recommended it. After a year of cleaning up counters covered with leaking coffee, cleaning up grounds that exploded when the basket compartment frequently popped out, and struggling to remove the grinding bin that often became stuck, making coffee became an activity to avoid at all costs. The coffee was good, but process of brewing it was a chore I dreaded. I could not leave the room until the process had ended and I was sure the basket bin wasn't going to pop out. No more! I'm hoping Santa will bring me a new coffee maker this year. ANYthing is better than THIS!

Title: Pet Hair Eraser One Great Vacuum
Content:
Do's and Don'ts about Model 3920 Bissell Pet Hair eraser
Don'ts first, don't expect to use the Users Guide It's a JOKE with Piss Poor Pictures, Don't expect to get the three screws needed to assemble this vacuum. 
Ok the do's DO EXPECT a clean carpet and removal of pet hair EVERYWHERE in your home!
I recieved mine today 1-25-08 and it works GREAT. I'm ashamed to say but it took pounds of dirt and a full coat of pet hair from my black lab out of my carpets. AND I WAS VACUMMING EVERY OTHER DAY WITH MY OLD EUEKA
Great Price Shipped free I highly reccomend this Bissell Vacuum
One product that does what it say's WOW that's a BIG DEAL in 2008.
Now if they would fire the photographer and get decent pictures of this unit for the User's Guide it would be perfect!!

Title: Lenovo W500 wireless problem; screen crashed before 18 mos.
Content:
Great reputation, looks good, case is smudge proof but I have had only problems.  Screen crashed before 18 months.  Glad I have the super warranty to fix in one business day - but that didn't help me out as the day of the crash was the day of a presentation.  Customer service was great the first time I called (possibly when I could still return the computer...)but has been anywhere from fair to awful since then.  Regarding the latest problem: To repair my screen under the extended warranty, I have a window from 9am to 1pm to wait for a repair tech.  I also was given a phone number to call at 1pm if he doesn't show (apparently this is so common they are giving me the no-show number in advance!)  
The second problem I have had since I got the computer,has something to do with the wireless connection.  At least 4 different techs have tried to fix by phone, usually---reconfiguring all sorts of stuff, but I still have the problem.  So after they have reconfigured my settings, the last guy is telling me it is a problem with my provider.  Interestingly no one else in my house, including lenovo users has the same problem.
I like that their support is in the US, but if you have a hint of a problem - RETURN the computer.  I wish I could!  Maybe the other models are okay, but I have noticed similiar problems listed on blogs for the W500.

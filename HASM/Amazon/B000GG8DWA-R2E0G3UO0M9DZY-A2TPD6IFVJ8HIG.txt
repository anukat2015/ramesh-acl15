Title: Nice Heater
Content:
I have a Holmes quartz heater (see my review) that I compared this to and the heat output feels the same. This means that even though the Optimus uses less watts, it easily compares to the larger 1500w heater. But the Holmes uses less power then rated (1125w high, 570w low). The electrical draw for the Optimus is reading 370w low, 716w high so it's actually using less power then listed as well. IT HAS NO FAN so it's completely SILENT. I don't recommend it for a large bedroom. Quartz were meant to heat the person in front rather then the entire room.
Since this model doesn't have a fan it'll probably be even LESS effective at heating a room. The quartz elements don't rattle while heating up. Another thing about the elements is they're yellow instead of the usual glass tubes with a coil inside. They put off a soft orange glow in the dark (softer then my holmes) on high, while low still loses to the Holmes because the Holmes model lowers both elements to a faint orange glow. But the Optimus isn't super bright either since it shuts off the bottom element.
My reason for a 4 rating is because it could've used a thermostat and maybe a timer. Also the heaters tip-over switch is on the bottom. This could be a problem for some if you tend to place it on uneven surfaces or simply picking it up to move. The housing feels a little...lacking. The area around heating elements seems to be made of a thin steel while the sides are plastic. The grill is some kind of steel that is hot to the touch of course. The heater appears white in the stock photos, but is actually a light gray.
Overall: It's great for quick heat at work, school or wherever you may need quiet warmth. But can it withstand the test of time...?

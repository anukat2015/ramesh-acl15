Content:
wow ok my dad bought one of these about a year ago and i was kind of skeptical. the few times he actually let me use it (hes a bit obsessive about it) i was impressed. im currently in college and this thing does all that i need and then some. replaced my old desktop and im loving it. This is my first mac and its easier to use than windows, yet it also provides all the advanced functions i need to write software. There are so many things i can do with it. Currently i am dual booting with leopard and vista 64 bit.

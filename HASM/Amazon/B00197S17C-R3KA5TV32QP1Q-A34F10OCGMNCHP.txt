Title: SUPER VALUE & GREAT COFFEE RESULTS
Content:
This was a replacement coffee maker for a 4 cup MR. Coffee that stopped working. The best feature is it makes 5 cups, so if you are using a larger mug you can get 2 full servings with each pot. The timer is easy to operate and works perfectly. I never used a steel mesh reusable coffee filter before but it works surprisingly well, but it adds one more thing to wash. Even finely ground coffee does not pass through the reusable filter. Paper coffee filters can be used as well. It can be purchased at Linen-n-Things for $15 with their 20% off coupons. A steal-of-a-deal at that price. The only negative about Black & Decker products is replacement parts (glass pot, filter) are generally not available at retail stores and sometimes they have limited availability since models come and go quickly. But for the price of this unit a complete replacement is less than a couple cups of coffee at Starbucks.

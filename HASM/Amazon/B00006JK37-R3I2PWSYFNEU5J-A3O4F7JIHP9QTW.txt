Content:
I just got the camera 3 days ago and did my first headshots today.  Awsome!  Great camera. Happy client.  Fast work flow.  I was torn between the Canon D60 and the Nikon.  And to be honest went with Nikon because it was the one that was available for my shoot -- But no regrets.  Great camera.

Title: Craptastic and that is being kind - Do not buy!
Content:
We bought one of these to replace a leaking Melitta One:One pod brewer. I liked this one's ability to brew using loose coffee in addition to the pods. Well, it was delivered and I anxiously unpacked and set it up.
First off, I had to try the "loose coffee" feature first. HUGE MISTAKE! Not only did it take about 3 minutes to even start pumping water through the thing, I was not aware that you had to pour water in for every single cup (no reservoir to speak of.) So, it brewed the coffee, ok. Then came the real problem. When I unlocked the coffee holder to dump it, grounds came out into the cup, around the cup, all over the counter and nearby. The cup of coffee was ruined as it had grounds all in and the grounds had actually been forced up INTO AND AROUND the mechanism that injects the water. Cleanup took damn near 10 minutes and MANY paper towels.
Additionally, although the description says it will use the Home Cafe pods, the holder was not nearly big enough for the capuccino pods we had.
I very generously gave it two stars because it MIGHT actually brew pods well. However, we will never know since - once I finally cleaned it up, BACK INTO THE BOX IT WENT for return.

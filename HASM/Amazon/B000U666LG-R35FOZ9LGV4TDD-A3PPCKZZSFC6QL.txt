Title: Sweet little Honeywell space heater
Content:
Reviewed every space heater I could find on the internet & ordered the one that best suited my needs.It's been 38F here,& gets down to 16F. The Honeywell Energy Smart Cool Touch Heater HZ-7200 heats up my coldest bedroom like a charm.Cord is long enough to reach the middle of the room.Controls are super easy to understand.VERY quiet.No odor.Lightweight & easy to carry too.Unit puts out great heat & works perfectly.

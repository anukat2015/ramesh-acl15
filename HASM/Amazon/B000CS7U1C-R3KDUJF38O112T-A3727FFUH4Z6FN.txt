Title: Great MP3 but not without flaws
Content:
I have had my 30 gb zen for just over a year. I received it as a gift and have been very satisfied with it. The sound quality is great if you replace the worthless headphones the player comes with. The picture quality is good too. I love that I could set the background as a picture when the iPods weren't capable of that. The program it comes with is really user-friendly. Drag and drop, could it be easier? There is a large selection of free "zen-casts" as well, several to which i am subscribed. My main problems with this player are the heftiness of it: its thick, large compared to the new ipods and other mp3 players; and the fact that sometimes it freezes, and the only way to fix it is to stick a paperclip into the in-set reset button. This doesn't damage the player or the content in anyway, it's just irritating. 
I'd really rather give it 3.5 stars. Overall, a really great player with flaws. For the price, I'd opt an iPod.

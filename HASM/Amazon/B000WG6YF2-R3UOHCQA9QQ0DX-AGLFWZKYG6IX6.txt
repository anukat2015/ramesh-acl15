Title: Great Little MP3 Player!
Content:
Well I have used this little guy for about a week or so and I come from using a Creative Vision: M 30gb player. 
Pros: 
Tiny
Great sound quality
Easy to use and understand
Syncs Easily with the PC
Customizable
Wireless syncing
Zune Social (share music with other people that have Zunes)
Radio
Can add songs from radio to cart to purchase later
Fun free games!
Plays a vast amount of different music file types!
Cons:
*No EQ
*Should have better music rating system (its just a heart or broken heart, should have three ratings at least).
*Should have ability to remove songs from the device (must be done in software)
Bottom line:
If your looking for a great portable music player to say take to the gym or have in your pocket this is your guy.
Much better then the ipods (as far as sound quality, features, and ease of use ect).
Hopefully in the future firmware updates (which Apple charges $10 for and is free on the Zune) they will resolve some of the cons I mentioned earlier.
Great product.
Highly recommended.

Title: Great Little Heater for the Price
Content:
This heater is very nicely compact and lightweight. While it will warm up a small room nicely, if you are really cold it works especially well if placed next to you. It would rate 5 stars if the fan was quieter even though the sound becomes just background noise. It is certainly a great value for the price.

Title: Mac is way better than windows
Content:
switching to mac is the best thing that could happen to any person in the world of technology. Its pretty, reliable, user friendly and I love it. Seriously do people love their computer or its a source of pain to them but they have to cope with it? you have the choice to enter the mac world and explore the most fun experience in your whole life. 
Another thing, mac dont crash. I own it for more than a year and I cant remember it crashes on me. Plus, you dont have to worry about viruses, malware, spywares, worms, trujans... etc. Many mac owner says this sentence and I say it all the time "I cant imagine life without mac"

Title: Cuisinart DCC-1100BK
Content:
This is a wonderful, reasonably priced coffee maker.  The
cone-shape filter keeps the coffee grounds from spilling over 
when making a stronger coffee. The unit is solid, the carafe
has a nice shape and size and the controls are easy to set.  Only
minus, hence the 4-star, is the clock does not light up.
All in all a fine unit.

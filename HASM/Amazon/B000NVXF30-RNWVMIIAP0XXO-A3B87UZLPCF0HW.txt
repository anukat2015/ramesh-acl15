Title: Very, very happy with my new Olympus Evolt E510-SLR
Content:
When I went out looking for a new digital camera I had some specifications in mind that this digital camera delivers and more.....
I hike, so I photograph nature----I view sporting events, so I needed a camera that would capture action shots without blur and would work with me in different lightening situations.
I am involved in different dog clubs and those little animals run around and play and you never know when you are going to get that perfect shot, but this camera is quick and efficient with this great dust reduction Supersonic Wave Filter (image sensor) I get a fantastic picture of my animals clear and pretty.
The screen size is 17.3 mm (H) x 13.0 mm (V)--perfect.... 
Effective Pixels number is 10 million pixels...... 
Another aspect of the camera is that it has brightness control at 15 levels-I just love that for the Pacific Northwest, one day bright, next day dark weather differences. 
The camera also has a AF illuminator Built-in flash, but I got an external flash that was available at an extra cost. Preview Can be checked (when Fn button is set in preview mode), selectable from the optical viewfinder or rear-mounted LCD monitor-nice option.... 
It has Live View, Live-MOS Sensor when still picture shooting is used, 100% field of view, Exposure adjustment pre-view, White balance adjustment pre-view, Grid line displayable, 7x/10x magnification possible, MF/S-AF, AF frame display, AF point display, Shooting information, Histogram, IS activating mode, and this is great-----"a heat warning." 
I AM ONE HAPPY CAMPER WITH THIS NEW DIGITAL CAMERA!!!!

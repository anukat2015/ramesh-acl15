Title: good mp3 player just what i expected
Content:
i recived the Zune for my birthday and have loved it ever sinced. i have nothing aginst the ipod and all homeschoolers like me have one but i wanted to break out from the main stream and try someting new. when you buy and mp3 player you look for sound quality, display, storage, battery ect. The zune has all that. the Zune market place, i have not tryed. you can use certan itunes songs. just look for the plus signs. bottom line the zune is cool and fun to use. 
P.S. i have not tryed the shareing from zune to zune still waiting for someone else to get one.

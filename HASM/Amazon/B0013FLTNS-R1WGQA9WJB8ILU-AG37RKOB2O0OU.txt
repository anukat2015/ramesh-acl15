Title: Last years Apple Macbook Pro computer
Content:
The computer that I purchased from you on Feb. 20th, 2009 is very nice & the price was definitely what convinced me to buy the Macbook Pro over the regular Macbook.  I did not need the more deluxe computer for my needs, but figured for only $300 more, it was worth it.  I was very surprised to find that the computer you sent me was last years model & that is why the computer was cheaper.  I did not read in your advertisement that the computer was last years model.  I am disappointed & have had trouble with warranty issues as Apple shows the computer being sold in 2008.  It took three attempts to convince Apple that I purchased the computer in February 2009. 
I would have definitely purchased the standard Macbook for $1,299.00 through my retail apple store & had the new model with everything I need & the convenience of saying I purchased the computer from them, which is always a plus when needing service or help with troubleshooting or any problems. 
I hope you will make this more evident in your advertisements in the future so people will be sure of what they are getting.
Sincerely,

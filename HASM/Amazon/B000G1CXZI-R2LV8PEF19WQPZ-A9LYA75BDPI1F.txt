Title: DeLonghi Oil-Filled Radiator
Content:
Product is sturdy, medium-weight but very stable. It is easy to move to various locations. I like the fact it can be programmed to come on at a time of your choosing. We use it to warm the bathroom prior to a shower and it works great. It is not instant heat; it takes a few minutes to come to temperature. It looks nice and does the job. We would buy this heater again.

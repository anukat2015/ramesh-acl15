Title: Average music player
Content:
The creative zen is just an average music player. Sound quality was decent, but no where as sharp compared to the Ipod. The one thing I did like about it was the bright and clear screen, so watching clips and movies looked great on the creative zen. Uploading the movies were a little bit of a hassle. The movie converter that came with it did a good job, but was just way too slow. I tried to use an external program to convert my videos and then store the video on an sd card to load it into the player's sd slot, but the whole thing just froze and I had to reset. So I don't think there is any way of going around it except using the video converter that came with the player. Unless there is a way and I don't know about it yet... any advice?? Anyway, on to the review, the FM player has horrible reception! Most of the channels had a lot of static and the reception never goes up to more than 2 bars. It's a nice extra, but I would not recommend any one buying the creative zen for the FM player. Battery life for the player was great. I could listen to it for a week and only need to charge once. The voice recorder was decent, but as mentioned on most reviews, don't click buttons while you're recording or you'll hear a lot of annoying clicking noises on playback. The SD extension worked fine, but may freeze up at times when loading more than 20MB. 
Overall, the creative zen was just average. I would definitely recommend it for the budget minded people because of the price and fun features but if you're a hardcore music critique than stay away.

Title: It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This
Content:
This device does exactly what it claims to do. I have used it heavily since I bought it and it has worked flawlessly. The only possible thing I could complain about is that I wish it would keep brewed coffee warm for longer than 4 hours, but this is a small thing most people probably wouldn't care about. It is wonderfully convenient to use this coffeemaker; remove the old filter and toss it, rinse the carafe and the funnel and you're all set for the next brew. Change the water filter every two months and that's pretty much it, maintenance wise. For slovenly bachelors like me it's perfect.

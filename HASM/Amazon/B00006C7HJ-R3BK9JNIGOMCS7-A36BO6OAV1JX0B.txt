Title: Don't waste your money!!
Content:
This is the WORST heater ever. The first one worked for about two weeks, then one day it just stopped working. We exchanged it for a replacement and that one worked for about four weeks, then it started sparking, along with turning on for five seconds and then shutting off. I kept it in our baby's room and got worried because it didn't seem safe.  When it did work, it heated up the baby's room pretty well, but I am sure there are other brands that work just as well and aren't so poorly constructed. I would suggest looking at another brand if you are in need of a room heater- that is what I am doing now.

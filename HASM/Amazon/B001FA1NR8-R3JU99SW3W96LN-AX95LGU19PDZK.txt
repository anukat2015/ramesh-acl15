Title: A True Story!
Content:
I bought an ipod shuffle for my seven year old son and I it was washed in the washing machine by accident one day. I thought it was gone for sure. After letting it dry out for a day, it worked! And continues to do so. I am amazed at how well it sounds and use it daily to workout. If a product can withstand being submerged in water (not that I would recommend you do that), then I am sold and would definitely purchase it again!

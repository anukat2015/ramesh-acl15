Title: If you are waiting to get a DSLR, now is the time!
Content:
This is really a great camera. As an amateur photographer in the film days, I have been waiting to splurge for a digital SLR since my first digital point & shoot in 1999 (a 1MP Canon Powershot A50 which cost nearly $500 back then). I have been through several digital point & shoots since then, but none of them came close to my film SLR's. When I saw this kit for this price, I knew I had to take the plunge. 
I'm really glad I did. This camera is so much fun, it is addictive. It is very light and compact for an SLR. With a 2GB card, I can take more than 500 pictures and the battery last forever. Since this is the low end of Nikon's DSLR's I was afraid it wouldn't have the control and features I was used to in my film SLR's. But this thing is a much more powerful photographic tool than my film SLR's. It doesn't have a depth of field preview, but who needs it when you get instant feedback from the awesome LCD. Moreover, because I don't have to be concerned with the price of film and film processing, I can keep clicking away until I get that perfect picture. The other advantage this has is that it records all the camera settings so you can later review and learn what works and doesn't work. This is a valuable training tool. 
Before buying this, I also debated on whether I should wait and save up for a camera with a higher MP rating or more durable construction like the D200 or D300. The image quality is awesome. I'll probably never make prints larger than 8x10, so the 6.1MP is more than enough for this.  Also, I know the D200 or D300 will last much longer, but given how quickly technology is changing, do I really want to sink that much money into something that will be obsolete in a few years? I could wear out 3 or 4 D40's for the price of one D300! Even still, if I outgrow my D40 or it breaks in the next 3 years, I'll have the option of buying another entry-level DLSR (which will probably be even better cheaper than the D40) or I can upgrade to a more serious camera (which will also probably be better and cheaper than today's D300).  
If you don't plan on making a living with your camera, I don't see how you can go wrong with the D40. If you want to get into a DLSR, this just may be the one for you!

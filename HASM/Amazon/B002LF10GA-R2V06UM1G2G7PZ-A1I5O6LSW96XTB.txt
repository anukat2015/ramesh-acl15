Title: Really Great Purchase
Content:
I bought this for my significant other's birthday. She was always struggling with her old Dell laptop searching on the net. It was very slow and cumbersome. Ran numerous diagnostics and repair programs. Nothing would work and finally decided that enough was enough. She has 
used this new Acer now for about a month and absolutely loves it. I also love seeing her happier and not frustrated. It is lightweight and very cool during operation. The touchpad takes a bit of time to get used to, but then it is very responsive. The size of the keyboard is also great. Purchased on Amazon and the service was great. Delivered on time and in great condition.

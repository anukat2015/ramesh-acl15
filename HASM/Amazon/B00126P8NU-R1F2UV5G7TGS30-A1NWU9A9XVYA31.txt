Title: x-mas 4 myself
Content:
was able to purchase this item along with accessories before the holidays and had  A YEAR to pay for them after applying for an amazon.com store card with deferred financing. 50$/month and now its all mine.
LOVE it for ALL aspects  sport(golf-waterskiing)/sunrise-sunset/fall foliage here in VT...
i've ben an avid 35mm camera user for 20+yrs (purely amateur) but have some postcard
quality pictures
i looked @ the nikon but could'nt justify spending THAT much $$$ for a body and 1 lens
know i've only begun to utilize ths camera to its full potential. 
with the 8gb card included i've taken in excess of 500 pictures w/memory to spare.
battery life is OUTSTANDING in my opinion. thinking maybe a higher end card will increase my speed w/the golf shots as w/it set on sport auto i only get 3-4 frames of a golfers' swing.
4.9/5 in my book   i would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone taking the "leap" into high
end digital photgraphy.
honestly, JAY CAMERON

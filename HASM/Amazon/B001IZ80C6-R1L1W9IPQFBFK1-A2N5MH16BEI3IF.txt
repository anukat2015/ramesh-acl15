Title: Love it, just does not last very long, 3rd one just died
Content:
Third one I have owned just died, and like the other times I had not kept a receipt and they said it was manufactured more than 3 years ago so it was out of warranty.  None were more than a year old.  I love the coffee maker but not at $100/year.  Buy two, keep the receipts and plan on dealing with LONG replacement times under warranty.

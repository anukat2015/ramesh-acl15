Title: Best rated from what I've read.
Content:
I've been using this coffee maker since my Cuisinart Grind and Brew disappointed me for the last time. They sell this coffee maker at the local coffee shop here in Chicago, Intelligentsia... great coffee BTW. It was the only coffee maker they sold, and the one of the best recommended by Coffee Geek [...]. I've been very happy with the consistently good coffee that this machine produces. The carafe keeps the coffee warm for about eight hours, it brews fast, and is quiet. I think it happens to be beautiful to look at as well. It's about as simple as they come, no bells and whistles here... just for purists. Technivorm also has very good customer service, which is nice for a company to offer these days. I would buy it again, hands down.

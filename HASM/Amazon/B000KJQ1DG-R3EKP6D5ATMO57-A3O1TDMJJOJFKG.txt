Title: Excellent amateur camera.
Content:
As a beginner photographer I've found this camera to be absolutely stunning. The included lens will give you a good range for all your typical photography (family reunions, pictures around the house, etc). This camera is excellent for the person wanting to switch from a typical "point and shoot" to a more sophisticated camera. The auto modes give you the "point and shoot" ability in case you don't want to (or don't know how to) mess up with the semi-automatic or manual modes. 
The included battery has a battery life that is good enough for me, although I've used it mostly indoors and not in very cold weather which is known to affect battery performance. So if you're going to be shooting in very cold places you might want to get an extra battery (is always a good addition). If you want to shoot things that are not close to you (say a person/object over 10-15 meters away) you might want to consider buying a second lens, the Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom Nikkor Lens which is an excellent addition. Also if you're shooting a lot in poor light places (parties, anything indoor usually) you might want to consider an external flash unit (SB-400, SB-600 or SB-800). 
But the equipment included will satisfy most people. This camera is extremely more powerful than a point and shoot, and still as easy to use. 
And if you're worrying about the 6.1MPs not being enough, I will say that unless you're planning on shooting as a PRO and printing pictures larger than a 12x19" you should be set with this I would say.

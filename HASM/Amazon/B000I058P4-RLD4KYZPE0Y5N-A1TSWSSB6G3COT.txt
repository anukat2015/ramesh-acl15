Title: Very Happy With Purchase
Content:
I generally read reviews prior to most purchases, so I made this purchase with my fingers crossed. However, I am very pleased with the B&D coffeemaker.  The auto timer is working great. It is a beautiful piece of equipment that looks great on my counter.
This is my first thermal, so the pot took a little adjustment on my part. Since the pot must seal to keep the coffee hot, It naturally, must be unsealed for pouring, and again sealed to keep the remaining coffee hot. It seals so well in fact that I do not even wake up to "smell the coffee." It makes great coffee (IMHO) and keeps the coffee hot long enough for me (probably 3-4 hrs)
  
I did not find operation confusing. I actually learned how to use the pot and the timer by reviewing the instruction book on the first day. 
My only slight disappointment is that I originally was looking for a smaller pot to replace my 12-cup pot.  I checked the measurements prior to ordering, so I was not really disappointed; but, I would have liked a smaller footprint.

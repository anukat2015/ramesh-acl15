Title: Doesn't get hot enough -
Content:
This is my 2nd Farberware - My 1st one lasted about 3 years after replacing the thermostat.The 2nd one lasted about 18 months - the thermostat went - I replaced it,and it worked again,but like the 1st one,the coffee is not piping hot when it is done perking.When it gets down to about 2 cups,the coffee then gets hot,but until then,I have to put my cup of coffee in the microwave to get it the way I like it.
No more Farberware for this household !

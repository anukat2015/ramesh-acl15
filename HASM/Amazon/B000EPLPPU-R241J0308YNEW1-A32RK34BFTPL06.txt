Title: I love this one
Content:
The I-Pod shuffle is very compact to carry. The clip provided is so useful so that it can be be attached anywhere. The sound quality is very good and no other player can beats this.It has a very good battery back up and last for me for 12-14 hrs. The only thing I hate about all the i pods are the way the songs are being uploaded. I-Tunes has to be installed and through that only the songs have to be uploaded in that.

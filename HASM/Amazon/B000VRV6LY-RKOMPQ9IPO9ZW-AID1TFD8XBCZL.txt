Title: Nikon D3 Digital Camera Gets Top Rating
Content:
I've been using the D3 for several months now. It is arguably the best camera Nikon has ever made. 
Image quality is superb, and the balance between sensor resolution and noise control is near-perfect. Ergonomics are the best of any camera body I've used, quick and intuitive. 
One company (DXO) has published test results for image quality among digital cameras and rated this camera very highly. 
Autofocus is greatly improved, as is the on-camera flash control system. The SB 900 flash, by the way, is a world-class tool that can easily replace studio strobes in many applications. 
Battery life is so good I sometimes forget to charge them up. 
Overall, the Nikon D3 camera is pretty much a must-have for serious photographers - with the prices coming down, it just makes sense.

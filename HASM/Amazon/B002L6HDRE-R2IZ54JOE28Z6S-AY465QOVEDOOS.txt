Title: less than pleased
Content:
i appreciate having the 16 gb size and the sound quality is good.  that much i like.  i don't like how hyper-sensitive it is - I bump it lightly and it turns on in shuffle mode, quietly playing music until the battery is dead.  in the car, a light bump does the same thing - shutting off the music i'm listening to and flipping into shuffle mode, playing a random entry I hadn't chosen (like, say, spanish lessons, all of a sudden).  I also find the new shape inconvenient.  I was much happier with the old version 8 gb iPod Nano, and regret that it is not available in 16 gb - I'd sell this new one in a jiff. Apologies, Apple, looking forward to the next version.

Title: Hand Powered Majik Vak
Content:
All in all, I really like this little guy. It won't pick really large items like legos or other crap your kid may drop in the car, but I'm really surprised by the power it has. I can fully vacuum my car with a single charge and it cleans my sports car just fine. Larger vehicles may need a ''pre-clean'' before you vacuum if it's especially dirty.
I've found the 'wet' feature to be as good as the 'dry' feature, and the vac doesn't really clog up when doing both. I dig that I can remove the plastic part, empty it out and continue cleaning. You can also smack the filter against something hard to loosen the dirt that gets caught in the filter sometimes. Sweet.
The cradle is a little bit cheap, but hasn't shown any signs of breaking yet. I have thrown this thing around and I gotta say, it's pretty solid. It's a lot better than the one I had before it. (You know, the old-school ones that you plug into the ciggie lighter and have the 1' cord that won't get you very far?) 
I would purchase it again if this one somehow got destroyed. Thumbs up to Hoover!
EDIT:
After owning this vacuum for about a month now, I can really say I love it! It picks up water off carpet like a champ. The only thing it won't really destroy is hair, pet or human. Other than that, it's totally worth getting.

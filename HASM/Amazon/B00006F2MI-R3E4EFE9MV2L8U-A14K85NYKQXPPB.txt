Title: The Coffee Maker That Ruined Christmas
Content:
After reading all the positive reviews on this site,  I ran out and bought one as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend.  What a disappointment.  The coffee tastes like hot water with a brown crayon dipped in it.   Why won't the machine allow you to adjust the grind size? Definitely a case of one gadget trying to do too many things and failing miserably.  We're sticking with our old Krups.

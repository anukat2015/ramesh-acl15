Title: against its peers, a few shortcomings
Content:
I love my VAIO, whatever that stands for.. but keep in mind the trade-offs you'll have for such a stylish machine. 1. Battery life sucks. With all power-saving settings, you'll be lucky to get more than 2.5 hours out of it. 2. No smart pad (useful double-finger strokes, ect.) and the pad locks up many times a day. 3. The screen is a little strange. (It produces an eye strain I don't encounter on my friend's computers) The best viewing angle is beyond 90 degrees. 
The good news is the keyboard is very mac-like and you can get a nice rubber overlay to keep your keyboard clean. Win 7 is a vast improvement (keep in mind you may need to buy a new compatible printer.) The pad is very sensitive (when it's not locked up) and the feel of the thing beats the pants off an acer or just about any other notebook I've touched. HDMI output is a nice touch. For the money, you can get an inch bigger on the screen and skip the blu-ray. (VGN-FW510F/B.) Just a thought..

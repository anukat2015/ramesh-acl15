Title: Impressed
Content:
I read all the reviews on the Creative Zen 4GB and was a little nervous about making the purchase, but went for it anyway.  I have to say, it's served me well so far.  I've had it for about 1 month and it hasn't fallen apart.  I've already uploaded 3 audiobooks on it and they all play great.  The bookmarks work!  The only problem I had was the device crashed 3-4 times on the first day because I was trying to learn how to use it.  When I'm not hitting buttons like a chimp, it doesn't crash, and hasn't crashed since.  (you loose your bookmarks when it crashes).  For the most part, I'm pleased.

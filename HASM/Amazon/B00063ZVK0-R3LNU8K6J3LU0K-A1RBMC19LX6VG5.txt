Title: Excellent!
Content:
Have the DVTH Heater for about 3 months. When I first took it out of the box, I thought "how is this little, lightweight thing going to heat up a room?"  Well it does.  I'm using it in a 2 room basement area and it's great.  I actually have to shut it after a few minutes because it heats up the room that good.  Also, not a noisy humming, vibrating sound and super compact and easy to lift to any area.  And it's so simple to use and change the temperature...

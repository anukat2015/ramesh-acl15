Title: Washer SAFE!!!!
Content:
I have read several reviews stating that it is not good for sports and that it is a bad product, but let me tell you, this item is awesome...
after going to the gym and of course getting it all sweaty, i kept mine in my sweatshirt and UPS!!! it went to the washer all and all including headphones, well after finding it at the bottom of the washer  (of course when finishing all the cycle) I drained all the water and allowed it to dry for the night, then connected it to charge and IT WORKS PERFECTLY!!!!! so despite all I have read, my personal experience is that at least it is waterproof!!

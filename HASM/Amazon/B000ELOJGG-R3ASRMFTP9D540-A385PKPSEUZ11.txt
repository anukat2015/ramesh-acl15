Title: I'm returning this air conditioner
Content:
My husband and I live in a Cape Cod style home. We do have central air, but it does not do a great job cooling off the second floor, which is where our bedroom is located. After reading some reviews online about this particular air conditioner we went to Lowe's and purchased it for about $400. This is the second day we are using it and I can honestly say it is the worst air conditioner. It does not keep the room cool at all. In fact, it's warm in here right now with it running on full blast (my dog is panting). It is also extremely loud, even on its quietest setting. We are going to pack it up and return it tomorrow and purchase a window air conditioner that will hopefully do a better job at keeping us cool and comfortable in this 95 degree heat.

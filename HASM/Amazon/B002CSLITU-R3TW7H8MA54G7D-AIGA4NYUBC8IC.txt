Title: Absolute junk!
Content:
I purchased this unit at the end of July last year and used it 6 times and the fan motor failed. I called to see if they would honor the warranty 1 month after it expired and recieved a, we can't! Six times and it broke???? Want to try your luck on a product this unreliable?? They didn't even give me an option to fix it.

Title: great iPod for all ages!
Content:
This iPod nano is the best yet.  We got it for our 13 year old daughter and she loves it.  For an adult I would recommend getting the iPod touch.  It's only a little more and any place with wi-fi you can get online, check email, download songs from iTunes and add tons of applications to play with and help with everything you can think of.

Title: One of the best combinations available
Content:
I purchased this item from amazon.com 4 months ago. In that time I have used this camera extensively and I have to say that the body and the lens are nothing short of amazing.
Much has been said about D200 and I feel compelled to say that it is one of the best camera's out there right now. It will make a lot of people happy with its performance.
The 18-200 is a great lens, onw of the most versatile lens available right now, from any brand. It is sharp and the VR will definitely help in indoor shots or in any image taken in low light. The only problem is that this lens creeps, that is to say when it is pointing downwards and you need a bit of zoom, say 50mm, the lens will creep forward, zoom on its own accord if you don't hold it with your hand. Not such a big problem but definitely a negative side.

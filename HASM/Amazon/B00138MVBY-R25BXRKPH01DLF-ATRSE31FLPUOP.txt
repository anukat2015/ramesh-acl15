Title: a great entry-level pro camera
Content:
i'm not a professional nor a novice, i have researched most of the entry-level DSLRs (going to the nearest bestbuy,is the best bet).Compared oly 510, canon xti,pentax 200d,and believe me this is over-all,one of the best built and most functional DSLRs in the market..altough two of them have in-camera image stabilization..the amazing lcd and the excellent live-view are just few of the features that got me hooked,the kit lens is not that bad either and the image quality is highly commendable..so what if it has a proprietary flash-shoe, it's not like u would buy all the accessories at once.. save up and buy the best(ahem, pardon me for the bias)if you are in the "professional" zone you wont be looking at these cameras anyways.. moreover sigma and tamron are already making excellent quality lenses for sony SLRs, stop fretting about flashes and lenses, if the body feels right, whether it's sony,canon or olympus,go ahead.. get the rest of the accessories slowly..i'm more than happy with this cam.

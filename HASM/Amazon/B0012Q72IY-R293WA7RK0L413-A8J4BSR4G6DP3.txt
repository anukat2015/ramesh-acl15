Title: Great beginning to D-SLR
Content:
I have had a 35mm SLR for several years but it has been collecting dust since the digital revolution and I purchased my first digital point and shoot.  Lately I have missed the control that I have with the SLR.  After doing some research as to if my film lenses would fit and what the reviews were I purchased the K200D and was surprised by all that it has to offer.  I love the fact that it uses AA batteries which I use rechargeable without any problems, the good battery life was also a surprise.  This is a great camera and has renewed my passion for enthusiast photography.  This camera has all the convenience of a point and shoot with the quality and control of an SLR great entry to midlevel camera with lots of room to grow.

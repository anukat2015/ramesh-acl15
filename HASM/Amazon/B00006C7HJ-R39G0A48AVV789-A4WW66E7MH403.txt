Title: The perfect winter companion
Content:
This is the second Vornado we have purchased. We've had our first one for about 10 years now. We use it in our basement rec room in the winter months when any of us are watching television or working at the computer. Warms up the whole area in a very short time. You realize how well it's working when you go to another part of the house and feel the temperature drop. We recently purchased another one as a Christmas gift for my 85-year-old mother, who is cold all the time. She loves it! Her house is really drafty and cold, and the Vornado VH2 Vortex Heater makes her family room nice and warm.

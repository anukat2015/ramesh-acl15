Title: love it
Content:
at first when i saw the coffee maching i did not like it i thought it was to small but after i used it i found it to be nice except my coffee tasted funny so thought to myself i should wash the coffee pot first and it was right.and now i think its the greatest coffee machine i ever had because so easy to use and for one person just enough coffee it was a smart buy and every thing i buy from amazon is always a great deal and something i am glad i bought. i am always happy with the way they ship things and take care of me as a costomer, this coffee machine is a 5 out of five.as always forever young god bless bobby lee 007.

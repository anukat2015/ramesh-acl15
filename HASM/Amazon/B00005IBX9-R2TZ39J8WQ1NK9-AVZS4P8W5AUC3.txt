Title: Absolutely hate this coffee maker!
Content:
I have had the Cuisinart Stainless Steel Model DCC-2400STR now for 6 months and it will this week be replaced. I absolutely hate it!
If you only make a few cups it is hard to see when it is filled up for that. No-with the stainless caraffe you can't see how many cups either!
Also the pot never gets clean any more - I have used the best cleaner inside to no avail - it won't come clean, and it is also hard to get into the caraffe due to the design not to forget getting the last cup of coffee out. 
I have more than 6 times, my husband at least as many times, thought the pot was empty when we made a fresh pot. Well, it was NOT and the result was a huge mess - overflowing into the drawers etc.
After once again this morning having this mess I have decided this pot is kicked to the curb and I will never again buy anything like it!
It is beautiful stainless steel ( therefore the 1 STAR ) and the coffee is at first nice and very warm ( not hot ), but it does not stay that way for very long. 
I think the improvements to this pot would have to incl: 
1. adequate opening into the caraffe
2. a window along the front side of the caraffe to prevent
   overflow.
3. window to the fill station
4. different material inside the caraffe so it can be cleaned.

Title: To easy
Content:
I bought this product for my brother for his birthday, so i decided to wait before reviewing it. He LOVES this thing, lol. One of my co-workers told me about Sansa, I had never really heard of this brand before. When she told me that it was better than some of the other mp3's and ipods she used I had to check it out. My brother uses it quite frequently and we were able to add music so easily. Of course the little bonus feature is being able to add gig's to the device. A lot of smaller mp3's do not have this option, so this was perfect for him.

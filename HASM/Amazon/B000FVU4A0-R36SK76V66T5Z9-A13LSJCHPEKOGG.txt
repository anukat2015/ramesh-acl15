Title: Funny looking but good cup of coffee
Content:
I bought this coffee maker based on it's good reviews.  The positives: I really like the fact that you can remove the entire water reservoir and clean it. I automatically use the Flavor+ button every time I brew as it makes the brew a little stronger, which is a nice option to have.  The pot has a no drip spout - that is a really great thing! I also love the blue light.
I only have minor negatives: I, unlike many people who reviewed, think the machine is somewhat ugly.  The big "dial" on the front reminds me of an old phone.  The design looks somewhat whimsical compared to higher priced machines but it's nothing terribly important to me and its great features outweigh this.  
Finally, for the price, you can't beat it.  I've enjoyed it for 1 month now and hope to have it a long time.

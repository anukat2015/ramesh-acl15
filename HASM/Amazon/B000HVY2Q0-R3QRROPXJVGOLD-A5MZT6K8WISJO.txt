Title: You'll be sorry
Content:
I purchased this heater thinking that it was cute.  It was cute but two problems besides the big stink that it creates when new: 1) The dials were broken when I got it. NOTE: The manufacturer was good for them and sent me two replacements. 2) After about 2 months of light use it DIED!  
So much for cute. I'm so ticked off that I don't even want to bother attempting to send it back because of the hassle. 
The two star rating was a mistake. I'd give it half of one.

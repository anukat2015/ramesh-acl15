Title: Not worth the mess.
Content:
One would think that Dirt Devil would come up with a sleeve to go over the fluted filter to make cleaning it easier.  As it is,  dust clumps and sticks in the filter grooves.  If you need a hepa filter for allergies, then get covered in dust cleaning the thing, it makes no sense.

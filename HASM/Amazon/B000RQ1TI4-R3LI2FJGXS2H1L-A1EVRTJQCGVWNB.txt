Title: Don't buy this thing
Content:
I have never seen such a dumb electronic device for regulation of air.
I still don't understand how this thing can decide to not trigger the air con while it is needed. Then suddently it may decide to do it... and depending on how you turned it on/off, its behaviour will change.
Just to say that the computer regulator for heater/air con is just not working decently !
A big mistake to have acquired this Soleus device.
(even 1 star is too much)

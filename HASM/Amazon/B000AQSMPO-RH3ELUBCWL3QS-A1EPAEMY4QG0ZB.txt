Title: B-60 Gourmet Brewing system...
Content:
I bought this coffee brewer over 17 months ago and it is still working as well as the first time I used it...
The coffee is always hot and tastes delicious!
The only thing I wish was different is the noise it makes while the water is filling the cup.... Some things in life have to be over-looked if all else is great...
I would buy another at once if something were to happen to mine...
I personally like all of the features of the B-60...It suits my family and friends very well...

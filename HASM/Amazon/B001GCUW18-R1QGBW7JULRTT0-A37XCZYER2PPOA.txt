Title: A good deal at $600, a bargain for anything less
Content:
I took a chance on this machine when my old IBM laptop went on the blink. Office Depot had a deal running on the Compaq that brought the price down to $405 after two mail-in rebates. At that price, I figured any risk was worth it. All in all, I have been pleasantly surprised. Two of the things that matter most to me--quality of display, and ease of typing--exceed expectations. The screen is beautiful and very sharp. I prefer working on the laptop to using the big CRT provided by my office because it's so much easier to read on. And even though IBM laptops were famous for their quality keyboards, I find the Compaq's easier to use, and I make fewer mistakes (I'm sure this is an individual thing). Other pluses: the onboard speakers are better than I expected even if no one would seriously want to listen to music on them for very long, and the sound through headphones is very good. After a little tinkering with the settings, I also prefer the touchpad to the one on the IBM (which I ended up disabling). After a few months of relatively light use, I haven't had a single complaint with the machine. Judging from comparative specs, I think it's definitely worth the $600 currently being charged at Amazon, and is a steal for anything less.

Title: Perfect First Time D-SLR Camera
Content:
I began using this camera as the editor-in-chief of my high school yearbook, and I couldn't have asked for a more reliable camera.  It withstood a large amount of handling (including several drops) yet never had any technical malfunctions.  It was also great for staff members who had never before used an SLR camera.  Now, several years later, I have purchased one on my own and have not been disappointed.  I decided to buy the body alone so I could purchase a mid-range lens that I would not have to change between every shot. I highly recommend this camera for amateur photographers looking for affordability and high quality.

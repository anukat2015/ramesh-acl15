Title: One of the best heaters to have
Content:
I just received this heater the other day, and I have to say this thing is very awesome. It's the best heater I have ever used because it's very quiet and it can warm up a room quickly. It also feels very sturdy and durable, and the size of it seems to be just right. So don't be alarmed about seeing a super large delivery box waiting in front of your door. One of the nice things about this heater is the comfort temperature feature button. I like this feature because it makes the heater warm the room and not to a point where it feels like you just opened a kitchen oven. 
Before buying this, I was looking for the electric type heaters that glow red and blows out the heat out with a fan, but after using a few of those in the past, which broke down too soon, I decided to get one that is more sturdy, and one with the type of design that has been working well for decades; a heater with an old-school design but with some modern capabilities. As mentioned before, the great thing about this product is that it is very quiet. So if you are a light sleeper, this is the one to get or if you just like things to be quiet in general then this is another reason to buy this heater. Another nice feature is that the wheels of the heater can fold inward when you need to store it back in the box or in a closet.
I really recommend this heater with two thumbs up to anyone !!

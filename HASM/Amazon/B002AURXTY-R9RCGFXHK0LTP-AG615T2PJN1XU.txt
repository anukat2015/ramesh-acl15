Title: Great laptop !
Content:
Great computer for the price just a few cons.
1.keyboard buttons are awesome i really do like but they are black so needed lights for a better use.
2.Can not get 8 hrs from the battery i try everything they said to maximize battery life but the best is 4.5hrs as a regular notebook which sucks for this is the main reason i selected this.
These are the only two major issues for me.
pros.
-love the colour and the metal casing on the display back.
-watch a few HD and Blu-ray movies and i must admit the display is amazing,crystal clear and bright..WOW!!
-runs quitely and just seems to never get hot ..never nice piece of tech. whatever that is.
-got a free upgrade from Acer to windows 7.Runs a little smoother after the upgrade.
-Amazing touch pad
-4 USB ports
-Card reader.
-loud speakers
-ok webcam not the best software for the cam also.
Have this for 4 months now and i'm happy with it the price was a little bit less than it is now but does quite enough for the price just wish the keyboard had lights.

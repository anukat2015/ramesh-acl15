Title: some what disappointed
Content:
I purchased two of these heaters last year. They were properly installed on  inside walls and work to expectations for the first season. (Expectations) low electrical expense, safe heating system. This season I noticed that both units were cracking. Since the units have a two year warranty I contacted the manufacture/distributor, note they do not list a  telephone number only an email address.  They did respond to my email, but nothing ever gets done.  They agreed to ship two new units but they never arrive, I was then told they are on back order (stall).  Then one unit did arrive, but it was a return from another customer and this unit was not only cracked, it was broken in half. Again, they do respond to my e-mail's but without results.

Title: Not great, not terrible
Content:
I've had mine for a week now.  I had no trouble setting it up initially, and the player itself has functioned perfectly so far.  It's much larger than I had expected, about the size of a deck of cards.  My only two complaints so far don't have to do with the player itself.  
1.) The Zune media player on my pc is terrible.  It's slow, clunky, and more complicated than it needs to be.
2.) The headphones that come with this player are a joke.  For what you are paying for these things you'd think they could afford to toss in a decent set of earbuds.  Instead they send oversized buds with foam pads that you have to attach yourself.  Mine lasted 2 days - one randomly fell off and got lost, and the other I got sick of re-attaching.  It's a moot point anymore.  I was walking through my office at work listening, and the cord for the headphones got stuck on a doorknob.  Without even pulling hard enough to take the phones out of my ears, the cord ripped in half.  Oh well - I was gonna upgrade to better ones anyway.
All in all, I consider myself lucky to not be having the problems many of the other reviewers are.  Also to be blunt, I don't think my expectations were/are as high as some of the others.  For the price of the unit, it's not bad.  Not great, but definitely not bad.

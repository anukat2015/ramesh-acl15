Title: NICE SPECS PROBLEMS DON'T CALL ASUS
Content:
After a very bad experience with an Asus N10Jh-A1 and due to Asus having a good reputation for laptops- a second unit was tried, the N61Jq-X1 (A1 is same except for having 2 year warranty).   Amazon has changed it's ad for this laptop since our company purchased this unit, as it does not have the TV grade, additional amplifier and cone speakers etc, which was advertised.  Asus website still has these features listed, including a really nice video touting their laptop.  Simply doesn't exist on N61Jq units.
Turned the laptop on for the first time, providing name /date/time, password and reached the create the System Restore DVD's (four required)part of setup. Inserted first new DVD disc and a half hour later, this laptop Blue Screened, BSOD, on SETUP.  When finally back at the point of doing the Restore discs for second time, the second attempt to do Disc #1, few minutes later another error box and BSOD again.   This is going well. Now on third attempt to do Disc #1 which started at 26% ?? and later, FOUR hours later, the four dvd backup discs are finished.  Don't expect I could trust these discs to Restore anything.  Day Two: ASUS was sent all the technical stuff (codes and information beyond my technical expertise, hoping only to provide Asus with information to fix the problem, OR be able to find out it's not repairable, information easily found using Windows 7 which I believe is the best thing Microsoft has done in some time and gasp! might even be better than XP.  Four separate emails and tech numbers from Asus later, the Asus techs are still talking about SRS drivers and issues nothing to do with BSOD.    Since initial setup, the unit in the past three weeks BSOD two more times while watching two movies from internet.  Interesting only for having nothing to do with DVD drive in unit.  The N61Jq-X1 as of yesterday is on it's way back to Amazon.  Going to purchase a Sony VPC-F111FX/H  or if Amazon takes forty days to credit the N61 like they did the N10, will order one directly from Sony. 
&lt;Note, clarify previous remark: Amazon is normally very good at returns and taking care of customers problems, and Amazon is a vendor our company will pay a  little more to buy from Amazon due to this customer service.  Everyone will have a bad day, so I wanted to be fair and temper the remark made here with additional facts.  In the big universe of vendors wanting your money, you'd be hard pressed to find a company doing better by their customers than Amazon.  Dillon Precision is one, they're out there, but the bar is up high.>  
It is likely in the universe of all the laptops which Asus produces that a couple of 'lemons' will come from their factory.  Have two big issues with ASUS,  First is their Tech Service from two different laptop, our experiences with ASUS Tech department in the past six months is deplorable.  Second, I have a real BIG problem when a manufacturer touts features and hardware that is NOT actually in the laptop.   Go to Asus home website  asutech or [...],, go to Products, to Laptops, Multimedia units, then click on N61, then click on N61Jq  or any N61J  code,, look at the Sound System you should have,  Watch Asus video...THE SOUND SYSTEM, SPEAKERS/AMPLIFIER ETC. JUST ISN'T THERE.  AMAZON IS CURRENTLY CHANGING SEVERAL WEBSITES ADS SINCE THE INFORMATION ASUS FURNISHED THEM WAS WRONG.  INDEFENSIBLE TO SELL A PRODUCT WHICH FALSELY DESCRIBES THE HARDWARE THE CUSTOMER IS EXPECTING TO RECEIVE FOR HIS MONEY.    
Just wanted to balance out the rave reviews,, I'm sure Asus does make some good units,  the free information is always worth what it costs you.   davzway/  TSRW INC

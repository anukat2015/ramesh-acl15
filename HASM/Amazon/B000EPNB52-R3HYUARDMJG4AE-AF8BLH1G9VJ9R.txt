Title: Lovin' my MP3 player
Content:
This is my first MP3 player and I love it. I have had no problems so far. It is everything that i had hoped for and more. I only hate the ear buds because they don't stay in my ears when I exercise. The 4 gigs is more than enough space for my new music and old CDs.

Title: Great digital camera, requires some learning and possibly extra equipment
Content:
I had an old Rebel EOS film camera with many 
accessories and autofocus lenses.  I bought 
just the XTi body with the intent of reusing
my lenses etc.  Camera is very high quality, 
takes excellent high-res digital photos, but
after trying to take some low-light shots I 
realized that I needed an image-stabilization
lens.  Not the fault of the camera at all.
It does so much, the only limitations are 
really my own knowledge.  I haven't yet used
the software that came with the camera...still
using the very good iPhoto that comes with 
my MacBook.  When I learn more about the 
camera, the software that it uses may be
more valuable (for post-processing raw format
images, I guess).

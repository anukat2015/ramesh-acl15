Title: A Great Vacuum, So Far.
Content:
I bought this vacuum to replace my 15 year old vacuum that was exceeding expensive and supposed to last a lifetime.  At the time of that purchase, it was the Mercedes Benz of vacuums, ranked second behind a Swedish vacuum that I'd never heard of or seen.
The Hoover works everybit as well as my other vacuum did, perhaps with better suction.  It doesn't require expensive bags, it's easy to manipulate, and it is compact enough to store in my pantry closet, close to where I make all of the messes.
The real test will come over time to see how reliable it is.  But at the price I paid, I could replace it about every three years and get more mileage from it than my "Mercedes Benz of vacuums."

Title: Meets my expectations but it's got a few shortcomings.
Content:
Unlike an earlier reviewer, I've not had a problem with the front wheel scratching our hardwood floors; I hope this is not a condition that develops later on. This vacuum does a very good job on both carpeting and hard floor surfaces. In fact, I'm actually impressed with the bare floor tool's design and performance. It's wider than most other canister vacs I've used (from Hoover, GE and Bissell), and it's a little lighter than its similar competition. 
Perhaps I am nit-picking a little here, but I find a few inconveniences that I wouldn't have expected from a company like Eureka. Perhaps my biggest complaint with it is the length of the power cord. The owner's manual specifies it at 15 ft, which is just too short to traverse our 20' X 25' living room without plugging the cord into several outlets. Second, the "Power Hose Coupling" does not allow the hose to rotate freely more than just a few degrees to the left or right. Instead, the front of the vacuum needs to be turned in the direction of use as you move right or left from your starting point. If you forget to do this the vacuum hose will crimp and you'll lose suction. My third complaint also deals with the power hose: in order to replace the dust/dirt bag, you must detach the hose from the vacuum. Since the coupling is made of plastic (as are most parts on the machine) it will eventually fatique and ultimately require replacement. This hose is not listed among the replacement parts that the consumer can order directly from the manufacturer even though it appears as if it will be the first component to fail.

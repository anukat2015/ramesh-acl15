Title: Looks Great, Doesn't Work
Content:
I bought the coffeemaker thinking that it would be a decent product for the price.  It looks good and it has a nice feature set but beyond its aesthetics and functionality this thing is very cheap!
The main issues I experienced were as follows:
1) It leaked.  And I don't mean a little dribble here and there; it created puddles.  See the other reviews.
2) Within less than a year it started to randomly stop during the brew process, almost as if it thought it was done.  The unit almost became completely useless.
3) The coffee maker tainted the coffee with the great taste of plastic.  As a person that really likes a good cup of coffee, this might have been the worst offense.  Of course a coffeemaker should at least work.
4) The amount of steam that escaped seemed unusual.  The finished brew was always short by about a cup or two.
5) The heating plate worked but didn't keep the coffee hot.

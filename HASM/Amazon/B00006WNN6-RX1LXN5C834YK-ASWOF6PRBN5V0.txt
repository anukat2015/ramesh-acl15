Title: Good for small rooms
Content:
I purchased this to use in a smallish sized bathroom.  It heats the room up pretty quickly.  We use the lower heat setting.  On the higher setting the trapped dust gives off a burning smell - not that easy to clean.
I used a marker to display the numbers that are not very visible at all.  There is only one fan speed (with no heat), but it is adequate for venting a steamy bathroom after a hot shower.
Worth the price - for a small room.

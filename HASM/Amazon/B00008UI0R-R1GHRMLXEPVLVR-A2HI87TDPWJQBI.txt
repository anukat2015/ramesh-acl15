Title: Hoover Windtunnel is Junk
Content:
I just returned from the vacuum repair shop where I had taken my broken 3 year old Hoover WindTunnel.  The quote to fix it was more than I paid for it.  The repairman said they broke like crazy, and showed me two other broken ones that had just come in.  Meanwhile, another customer walks into the shop with another broken Hoover WindTunnel.  Hers had a broken beater attachment.  Mine had a broken control unit.  I gave her mine to cannibalize for parts.  Walking her to her car, she said hers had already broken once before.
This vacuum was great out of the box, but realize you're buying something that's going to break on you very soon.  My old Hoover lasted me 20 years.  The lady I gave my broken WindTunnel to said her prior Hoover lasted her a long time too.
No more Hoovers for me.

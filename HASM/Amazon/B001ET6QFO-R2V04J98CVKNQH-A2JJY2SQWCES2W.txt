Title: Images IQ on 40D are better than 50D
Content:
I am surprised to see that the images on the 40D are better than the 50D.  I would think logically it would be better to have the CMOS updated on the 50D, but when you compare images side by side 100% crop, the 40D wins.  More Pixels doesn't mean better, and that's what the camera factories would want you to believe.  The big reason I would want the 50D is for the totally improved LCD screen, which is like the D300, to see if you are getting the shot you want.  If you're looking for improved image quality, stick with the 40D. That's truly a great camera!

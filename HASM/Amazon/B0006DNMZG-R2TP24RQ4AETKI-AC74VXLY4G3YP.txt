Title: Melted Itself Open
Content:
I bought this heater last year and used it all winter very happily. It worked very well and kept my computer room comfy and warm. 
This year i brought it out to use, plugged it in for day use and on the second day it started turning off on me after about 3 min of use. I unplugged it and let it cool off since it got amazingly hot after that 3 min and i discovered the black, round casing with the holes in it that goes around the top, had melted itself open in the back. 
I loved this heater last year but can only give it 2 stars due to longevity.

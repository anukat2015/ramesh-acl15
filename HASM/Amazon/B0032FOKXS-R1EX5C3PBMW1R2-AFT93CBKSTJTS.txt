Title: Great laptop
Content:
Pros - 
* Super performance
* I like the switchable graphics card
* Multi touch track pad
* Very little heat/noise
Cons - 
* Keyboard makes click sounds (I prefer silent keystrokes)
* Touch pad misses response sometimes...takes lot of getting used to
* Battery life no way close to 12 hours....more like 5 to 6 hours with normal usage (full brightness, wifi ON, browser and word)
* Not smoothly finished around the top of lcd lid
Overall - 
Nice overall product with everything I was looking for in a portable yet powerful notepad. I would recommend it. Cons were enough in number else deserves a 5 star rating.

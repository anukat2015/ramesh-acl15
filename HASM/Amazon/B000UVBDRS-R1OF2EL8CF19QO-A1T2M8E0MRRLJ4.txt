Title: Excellent Alternative to iPod
Content:
I've had the Zen before (a 2GB model) and enjoyed the operation and use.  Navigating the built-in memory is much like Windows Media Player, making it easy to work with.  The battery life tends to flag a bit with excessive video use, but the addition of a car charger made that workable.  As a whole I liked the 2GB unit, passing it on to my boyfriend when I purchased the 32GB model.  The larger built-in memory suits my needs much better, though I still use the memory cards for larger files such as videos.  All-in-all, an excellent purchase.

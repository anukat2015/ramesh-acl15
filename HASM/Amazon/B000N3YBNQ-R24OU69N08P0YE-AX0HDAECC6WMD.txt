Title: Cute little thing
Content:
It looks different and has powerfull suction. Just watch the cheap wool rugs. It could have too much suction and an agressive roller. Design is great but I wish it had a detachable hose for the steps but for the price, power, and looks, I knew what I was getting myself in and glad I did.The thumb control of selecting the different surfaces and great too. Bright LEDS and buy extra bags.Cord could be longer but not a big deal.

Title: One Fantastic dSLR from Sony
Content:
After ~ 3000 shots with my Sony A700, I'm pleased to say this is one FANTASTIC camera.  This is my first dSLR but I'm a long time point-n-shoot Sony customer (DSC-S85 and DSC-P92).  Sony has hit a home run (at least in the park) with this model.  The rumor mills are debating Sony's intentions but with this body (and the small number of authentic Sony lenses for it), I think it's safe to say Sony will be a player to compete against the Canikons and Olymjis of the world.  My two cents...you WON"T be disappointed with this camera!  I've added to it the F56 flash and the 100mm Macro lens, along with the 18-200mm telephoto.  Enjoy the camera!

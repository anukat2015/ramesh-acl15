Title: Don't waste your money!
Content:
I paid $[....] for this at a Costco.  I've had it for 2 weeks, it overheats everytime that I use it!  I've searched every possible place for a clog to be and there isn't one.  I called Hoover's hotline they said it's clogged I told them it wasn't and the lady said it was and that's all there was to it.
I will never buy another Hoover or reccomend them to anyone.  Thank goodness Costco is going to take mine back and refund the money.
Use your money on a different brand with better customer service!

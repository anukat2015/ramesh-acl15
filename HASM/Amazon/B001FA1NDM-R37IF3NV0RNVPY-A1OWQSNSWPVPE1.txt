Title: ipod gen 4  review
Content:
This is my 2nd mp3 player..(Sony was the first player I owned----PROS--- Ipod is very thin, colors are bright, Itunes imported my music (from my music) easily, photos imported easily too..The ipod sound is better than then Sony, the main reason for buying the ipod. Lots of features-finally found the EQ----CONS---- 1st one malfunctioned----device is pricey as apple always is. Needs a protective case...and did I mention hard to navigate?....Apple stock earbuds don't work in everyones ears....(Ive purchased four other sets) The screen is very small...Again its difficult for new users to navigate..(the sony was easier)...Sound could be better...Not much bass in these little mp3 players...----UPDATE----....Returned 1st one as it malfunctioned after 3 weeks.. Amazon was as good as gold..Everything went so smooth...I recieved the replacement quickly and it seems to work better.....I am much more knowledgeable about this device now...If you are having problems understanding this device and Itunes, find the nearest teenager and have them explain it to you. The directions are useless...I would consider buying the 16 gig Nano or any future versions under [...]...REMEMBER plan to spend money on cases and earbuds.----UPDATE NUMBER 2-----Wheel on 2nd Ipod locks up often, even after multiple resets....going for ipod #3 as I need an mp3 player...Recieved ipod #3..So far it works great---through all this Amazon has been great****

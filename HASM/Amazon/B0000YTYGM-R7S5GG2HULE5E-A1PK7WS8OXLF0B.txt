Title: Not for the elderly or poor sighted
Content:
This is the second one of these I have purchased as I love thermal carafes over having a hot plate run all day and bake my coffee. My first one died just a few weeks after the 3 year warranty ran out (amazing how they time those things), it had been getting slower and slower, then just died. If you are dexterous you'll love this coffee maker, but it does have a few difficulties - the top is oft hard to get on as it does not seat on the threads properly for an easy spin on, you have to fiddle a bit to get it on right. The basket for the coffee grounds likewise does not easy drop in a seat just right, if that crooked your coffee ends up all over the counter, some fiddling required ther too. Only other issue is cleaning, being stainless steal you can't use Oxycleaan to whisk the coffee stains away, I use baking soda BUT you have but a small hole to cram a brush thru and can not get alll areas clean, I wish the whole top would open off for proper cleaning. Otherwise it makes great coffee and keeps it hot for a long time, so despite the hiccups, I did buy a second one.

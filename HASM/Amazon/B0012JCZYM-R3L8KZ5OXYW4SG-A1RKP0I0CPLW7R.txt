Title: Don't buy the Apple iPod touch 16 GB with Software Upgrade
Content:
I received it last night -- I will have to return it -- both Apple and AT&T told me the Amazon Apple iPod touch 16 GB with Software Upgrade is not supported by Apple or AT&T -- it doesn't have a SIM supported by either, and cannot be synched with itunes, Apple, or AT&T -- The software is not officially due until June, so this is a cracked ripoff version of the 499.99 model sold by Apple and AT&T.  Do not be fooled like I was by this low price.

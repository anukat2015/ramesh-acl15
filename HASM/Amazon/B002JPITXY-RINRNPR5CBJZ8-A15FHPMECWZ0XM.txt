Title: MS Definately did a good job
Content:
All in all this is an awesome product, it is very lightweight while still feeling very sturdy. The zune software is excellent especially with the recent 4.0 Update paired with a Zune Pass. On the firmware side there are no bugs and the menus are excellent and extremely easy to navigate. I am an owner of an iPhone and the Zune HD and I carry both with me. Ive owned an iPod Touch, Recent generations of iPods and a Zune 30 First Gen and an 80 Gig First Gen and now the Zune HD. I would pick any generation of the Zune over any iPod hands down. The only cons I can see with the Zune HD so far is the lack of Apps (But that was more than expected) but I cant complain about the current ones, as they are free, and the WiFi. If you are getting this for browsing, this isnt excellent but it IS usable but is a bit difficult to navigate. Stick to using the WiFi for wireless syncing for now. 
Overall, if your juggling between the Zune, an iPod or other MP3 player, go for the Zune HD. I love it and regret nothing over my purchase, and the ability to use the Zune Pass is lovely along with beautiful UI and PC Software. Buy it!

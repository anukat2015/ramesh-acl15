Title: piece of junk
Content:
I bought this yesterday, vacuumed two carpets, emptied the dust holder twice and it stopped working. The "carpet" mode does not turn on. I have let the motor "rest" overnight, checked the connections, wands, etc. It's a piece of junk. I am returning on its first day after arrival. The 1-star reviews on Amazon are RIGHT. Please read them and do not buy.

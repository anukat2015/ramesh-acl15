Title: Once You Go Mac You Don't Go Back
Content:
I've been a PC guy forever and I never thought I would change but, after taking a chance on a Mac I can't believe I waited this long. It outshines even the most sophisticated PC without even trying. Everything looks so much better, and clearer. The programs run with ease, even with multiple applications. The navigation is excellent regardless of what your doing and it makes absolutely no noise at all! I could go on forever but the bottom line is "This computer is in a class all by itself".

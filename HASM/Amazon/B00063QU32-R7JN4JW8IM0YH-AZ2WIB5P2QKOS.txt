Title: nice idea - had some problems
Content:
Just bought this unit.  The design is quite nice as far as being able to rotate the vents and the flexibility to have one down, one up, both down or both up.  You can set the desired temperature, but you should know that you can only set it to 60, 65, 70, 75, or 80.  That's it.  Nothing in between those.  The main problem I have with this unit, and it is going back tonight for a replacement, is that my room is 64 degrees, and the unit won't go on until I set it to 75.  And even at that, it shuts off after the room gets to about 65 or 66.  To me, it seems like the thermostat is off by about 10 degrees.

Title: Cuisinart Coffee Maker DCC-2000
Content:
Come on people - let's not let Cuisinart take advantage of us like this.  Read all the reviews in here re: their design flaw.  I just called to get mine exchanged - same problem, no electricity, leaks, etc. etc.  Now they are on back order - no telling when they will come in and you have to pay the $10.00 shipping fee.  Now that's not a warranty.  It would never hold up in a court of law.  They need to trash their design and start over.  Stop buying their products so they will listen to us - the CONSUMER!

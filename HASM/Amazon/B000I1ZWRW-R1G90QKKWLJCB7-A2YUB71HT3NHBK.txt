Title: I love this camera, you will LOVE this camera
Content:
I bought this in January, and as a result have rediscovered photography!  Back a few years ago, I was shooting about 300 rolls of slide film a year, mostly underwater.  Lifestyle changes, and I was down to 2 or 3 rolls of print film a year for the last six years, BUT...  Now since January I have shot about 4000 pictures!  Search flickr for John Brandauer for some samples.  This camera is amazing!

The kit lens, well...., it's OK for the money, a kit with the 50mm 1.8 would have been better( a bargain of a lens), but the price of the body versus the kit and it is $67 for the lens!  So get the kit, then the 50mm, and the 100mm Tokina macro (my favorite lens!), and the Tokina 80-400.  That's what I did.  The wider will come later,
Still learning the nuances of digital, relearning the advantages of a tripod, etc, but thoroughly enjoying!  This is a lot of camera for little money.  I sold my Nikon's: 8008, FM, EM, 2020, I'll not go back.  Digital SLR is the way to go!
Quality pictures, ease of use, feature rich, large display, user profiles, the list goes on.
UPDATE: There is currently NO DRIVER FOR VISTA.  If you are using Vista, your camera will not be recognized properly, your Canon software will NOT download your images.  Come on Canon, let's get with it!

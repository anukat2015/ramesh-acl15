Title: The Best Player So Far
Content:
The Zune is my 5th player.  My first was a D-Link several years ago.  The Zune is the best one yet, as one should expect.  The playback quality for music is excellent.  The video resolution is acceptable even when stretched to play on my 65" TV.  My ONLY complaint is about the Zune software, not the player.  Like iTunes, the Zune software is annoying, irritating, and does not let me have enough control, but it is a relatively small price to pay to use a player the quality of the Zune.  Also, the accessory kits were very useful.

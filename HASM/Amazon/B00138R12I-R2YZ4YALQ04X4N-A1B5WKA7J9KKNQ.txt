Title: Best DSLR for the price
Content:
I compared this camera with the Nikon.  Live View was the deciding factor.  This camera is great.  Pictures are super clear.  I have not had much time to use all the features but many think that the photos were taken by a professional.  I shot on auto mode!  Sports shots come out great, the clarity and speed are really wonderful for an amateur photog.
Downside, you can get some shadow as the flash pops up quite low and can cause shadow with the lens.  
I recommend getting the accessory kit with the extra battery as I am always forgetting to charge it.

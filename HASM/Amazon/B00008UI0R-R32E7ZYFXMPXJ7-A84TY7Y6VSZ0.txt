Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
This is my second Hoover WindTunnel. We purchased the first one 4 years ago and it is still doing an excellent job. Having a three story house I got tired of going up and down stairs so we use the the other one full time in the basement. Between hardwood floors and rugs this is the best we have found. The bagless canister is the easiest to keep clean. I do wish they would make a soft brush for cleaning pictures and other wall fixtures.

Title: Great Tasting Coffee
Content:
We had a Krups for about 10 years and it finally died.  I went with Consumer Report's advice and bought an expensive Cuisinart....it was a mistake.  After trying several coffees and formulas in the Cuisinart, I finally gave up and bought another Krups.  The new Krups made coffee as good as the old one.  I'll never switch again.

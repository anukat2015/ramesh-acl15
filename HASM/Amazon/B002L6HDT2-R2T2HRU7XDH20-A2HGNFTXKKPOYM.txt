Title: Apple has done it again a nice player with a lot more features
Content:
I purchased the 8 gig Ipod nano yesterday after my other Ipod nano 4th gen which is also an 8 gig decided to start acting strange cutting out in the middle of songs. Not sure why its works on the Ihome flawlessly but not with headphones anymore so it is considered a home Ipod now. I have had this Ipod for almost a whole day and already I am enjoying it as much as I did the 4th gen Nano I am quite impressed with the video camera as the quality of the video is amazing for such a small device. The radio feature is awsome however I wish the radio worked without the headphones but I guess you can't have it all and its something Apple should have put in the Ipods long ago the reception is awsome there is one station that doesn't come in but its ok as I don't think I will be using the radio all that much but its an excellent feature to have and the pause live radio feature is kind of neat with tagging the song so you know what song is playing so you can purchase it on Itunes later of course being able to rewind the songs is a nice feature to. I think the pedomter is also a nice feature but I haven't had chance to check it out yet as I haven't been a able to go for a long walk but will try it out as soon as I can once the weather warms up and I will have to update that later all and all its a nice upgrade from the previous gens I have owned and apple keeps coming up with new features with every gen would like to see what they have up their sleeves next but I won't upgrade until this one goes I have had six ipods and so far I have had no problems with any of them just needed to upgrade because I was running out of space 8 gigs is more than enough for me and its worth the price for all the things it has if you don't have one let this be the first one you buy if you already own the 4th gen keep it until dies unless you want to upgrade for the better features all and all a great product go get it if you don't already have it.

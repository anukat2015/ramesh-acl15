Title: Superb Upgrade From A Wonderful Gen 2
Content:
Having owned a number of MP3 units over the years (from various brands), I became smitten by the ergonomics and design of the 2nd gen Nano. When the 3rd gen came about, the addition of video capability called to me. I have passed my gen 2 Nano on to my wife. The video of the 3 gen is truly impressive. I'd never expect to be comforable watching a full two hour film on such as small screen, yet the sharpness, brightness and clarity of the Nano screen making watching even that long a film a pleasure!
I am very impressed with the Nano, as you can see. 
I added the V-Moda Bass Freq headphones for under $35 and the resulting sound reproduction is just superb.

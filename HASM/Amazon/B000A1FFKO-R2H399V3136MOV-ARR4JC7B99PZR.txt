Title: Great Coffeemaker for the Money
Content:
This coffeemaker comes with everything you need except the coffee.  It has a permanent filter and a coffee scoop.  It is programmable and you can adjust the coffee brew strength.  It just makes the best coffee!
This is the second one I bought... I took my first one to work so I can have coffee anytime I want it. 
The only two things that could be better is you have to be careful pouring or you will make a mess.  And the one I just bought, the carafe only has cup markings on the side for left handed people (which is a bit annoying).  My first one has the markings on both sides, so this may just be an unintentional defect.

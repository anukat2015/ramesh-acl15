Title: Small and fun and orange
Content:
It 4th gen Nano is a lot of fun and well designed.  I love the orange--cutting edge and cool.  It is small which is great mostly, but I struggle a bit with the controls.  Sometimes my big fingers can't hit the right option and sometimes when moving it, I knock the volume down or up drastically. (Up can be an issue when driving down the street.)
I am not a big-time music collector, so I find that 8GB is plenty for me.  I've got all the music on it plus about a dozen podcasts on it with more than half of the memory remaining.  
I don't really like the standard earbuds.  I've never liked earbuds.  It doesn't take much for them to fall out.
All in all it's cool and I love the orange even if my teenage daughter thinks I'm too old to own anything this color.

Title: Its good photography
Content:
I have read reviews says 40d is much better than 50d .. nevertheless, I have purchased this piece from amazon and start practicing my new hobby. I honestly can't compare how great this camera is among other camera since I have never tried sDLR before. But what i can tell you is that its a great way to start with this camera to feel that you control your photos and start improving your understanding of picture decision-making process. Its really a nice journey to take with this camera.
When I started enjoying my pictures .. I realized that this hobby needs a lot of $$ to satisfy my hunger .. i.e. lenses, tools, and equipments which you can add to your camera and could play a major role in your pictures .. so get your self prepared for extra $$ spending.

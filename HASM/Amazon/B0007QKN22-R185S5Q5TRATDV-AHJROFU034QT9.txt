Title: if there was a god, it would be this camera.
Content:
it's a great camera. my one complaint (this can probably never be fixed, so i'm cool with it) is that the lense it comes with is standard. telescopic ones cost more, and after buying a 500 dollar camera with a 60 dollar memory card and a 100 dollar tripod, i'm kind of wiped out.

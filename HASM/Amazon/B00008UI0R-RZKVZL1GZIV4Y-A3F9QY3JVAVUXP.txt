Title: Hoover canister vacuum
Content:
My research said that this was one of the best on the market, and it is.  The components are sturdy.
Love the multiple levels of suction.  It's light weight. The handle ratchets to any desired height.
And, cleaning out the dirt trap is very easy. Mine came with the mini-beater attachment, which is great for furniture or the carpets in the car. Can easily recommend this product to anyone in search of a new vacuum.

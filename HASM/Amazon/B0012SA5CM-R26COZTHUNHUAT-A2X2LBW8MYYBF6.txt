Title: Disappointing on Many Levels
Content:
I wanted just a basic coffee maker with a thermal carafe--no frills, just good hot coffee.  After purchasing this one, it inexplicably stopped working after using it twice.  After a bit of e-mailing back and forth with customer service at Kaloric (they were very nice) they sent me a new coffee maker free of charge.  The issues I have with this coffee maker is that it takes well over 1/2 of an hour to brew a pot of coffee!  Also, the resulting coffee is highly inconsistent.  The first cup is very weak the last very strong.  Another complaint I have is that it is nearly impossible to pour water into the reservoir or pour a cup of coffee without making a complete mess--very frustrating!  I can't wait to get rid of this and get something that actually works!

Title: Doesn't last
Content:
I have had this heater about a year. After a few months it no longer turned off by the switch. I have to unplug it, which is a good idea and no big deal. Now, a few months later, it is running all the time regardless of the setting. Today it has a burning smell so I'm getting rid of it.

Title: Better than 35 mm; just short of 6x6 cm
Content:
I have used 5x7 in., 4x5 in., 6x6 cm and 35 mm formats over the last 30 years, and have developed and printed all my work in my own darkroom (B&W and color). The combination of Canon's XSi plus my PIXMA Pro 9000 printer (also purchased through Amazon.com) surpasses the quality and longevity of my color C-prints and Cibachrome in 6x6 cm and 35 mm. Thanks to Amazon for delivery in under the time specified. And thanks to no arguments about stock outages and kit contents, which was so prevalent with several less-than-professional NYC camera outfits over the years, except for B&H Photo, a truly professional supplier. 
I don't think I can add much to what's already been said about this camera. The cost and the quality of this camera and PIXMA 9000 printer come in far under what my darkroom cost me many years ago--only deliver superior results--with no carcinogenic chemicals.
I also own a Canon A620, which has delivered fantastic results for a small point-and-shoot camera that fits in your pocket. 
The next step is to build up my Canon lens selection; I'm converting from being a previous Minolta (35 mm) and Mamiya (6x6 cm) user.
One word of advice: Don't skimp on the inks and use any cheap stuff other than Canon inks (or OEM inks for the printer you own). After all, permanence is worth paying for--just as the quality print materials you purchased and the archival processing you would have spent hours doing in the darkroom.

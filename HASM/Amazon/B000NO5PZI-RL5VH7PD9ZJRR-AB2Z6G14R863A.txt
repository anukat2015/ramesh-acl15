Title: Great vacuum but definately old school loud
Content:
It's a little loud but does a great job suctioning and maneuvering.  The dirt cup comes out really easily which is a definate plus in my book!  It does a decent job on floors as well as carpet but not as well as my Eureka cordless quick pick up vacuum does.  All the attachments work great.  I love the little attachment with the rotating brush which works great on lamp shades, upholstery and small areas.

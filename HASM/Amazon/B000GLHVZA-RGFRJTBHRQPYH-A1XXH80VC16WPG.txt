Title: Silent and steady room temperature
Content:
I own two Vornado AVH1's and am about to buy my 3rd (for baby's room). I haven't had any problems at all so far. They work exactly as advertised. Tip: I only use the low setting since, IMO as an engineer, this should greatly increase reliability/longevity. But I live in south Texas where a small room can be kept warm on the low setting even in the middle of the winter.

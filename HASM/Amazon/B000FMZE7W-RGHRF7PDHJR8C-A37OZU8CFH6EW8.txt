Title: Hmmm, very deceiving
Content:
Well I was very excited to buy this anti i-pod product because I am not a very big fan of apple, but I do love to listen to music and want something that can fit my entire collection. But immediately when I started downloading the software for the Zune, I was met with unfortunate results. Every time I started downloading the software it hit an error message and told me to reboot and try again. Next try same thing, after about an hour or so I go to there official website, no help there. And now I have decided that this player would be a lot better if it supported easier plug and play compatibility's. Bill gates..... you sure dropped the ball on this one. The only reason that it got 2 stars is because I have seen this thing at a friends house (and it was working) And I do know that this can be a truly amazing piece of hardware. Right now I am leaving to take this back to my local store.

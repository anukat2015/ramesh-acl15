Title: Do Not Buy This Vacuum
Content:
Do yourself a favor and pick out another vacuum to buy. This thing may be the worst home purchase i have made to date. Why would a vaccum have an adujustable power knob? Isn't the purpose to pick up as much crap off the floor as possible? Even at full power, the suction on this thing is a joke, any attachment falls to the floor & i feel like breaking the machine into 100 pieces everytime i am forced to use it.

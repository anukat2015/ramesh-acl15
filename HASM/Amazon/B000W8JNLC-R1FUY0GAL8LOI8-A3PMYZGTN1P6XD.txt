Title: Very good value.
Content:
I purchased this burner to melt lead in a large cast iron pot.  I was frustrated with the smaller burner I had as it would take over 2 hours to melt 30lbs of lead.  This burner is very stable and had a 30 pound pot of lead melted to 600 degrees in just 40 minutes, and with the flame control, I could easily set the heat down to keep the temperature constant.  Wish I had bought this a year ago.  It attached easily to a standard propane tank for the grill.  Electric start does not always fire it up on the first try, but I have never known an electric start to work 100% anyway.

Title: Struggled since the beginning
Content:
Bought this unit about a year ago after reading rave reviews from just about every website that sold it.
From the very beginning this unit struggled to cool down a small bedroom (roughly 12x12). If it was 95 outside, the unit would barely get it down to the high 80s. The exhaust tubing was difficult to run with the window being roughly 5 feet off of the ground, so it was putting lots of heat back in the room. Just a few days ago the unit decided to just stop and flash. We emptied the tank, and it was full in an hour. this cycle has gone on and on, and now we are looking for a new unit.
Not worth the $300 we paid for the unit, and I certainly would not recommend this unit to anybody.

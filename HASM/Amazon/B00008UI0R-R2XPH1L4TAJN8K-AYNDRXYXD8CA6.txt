Title: good vacuum
Content:
The directions didn't say anything about the wand adjusting height. My first time using this vacuum I thought it was too short and was going to cause a backache until I accidentally adjusted and now the height is perfect. I love the location of the floor/rug switch and the multiple levels of suction power. This a great vacuum that works quite well on both my rugs and hardwood. The fill cup is too small and a little awkard to empty would be about my only complaint.

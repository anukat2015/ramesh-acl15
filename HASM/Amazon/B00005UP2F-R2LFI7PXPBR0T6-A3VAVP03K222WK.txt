Title: Good suction; bagless systems poor.
Content:
Although the Vision Canister is advertised as a bagless canister, it is a misnomer. The product has excellent suction power but instead of the debris staying in the cup so that it can be simply emptied for disposal, the dust and 90 percent of everthing vacuumed is embedded in the filter. This means that everytime I use the Vision, in order to clean it, I have to remove the filter; hit it repeatedly against a wall to dislodge the trapped dust.  This causes a dust cloud you would not believe. I have resorted to sticking my hand in a garbage bag and banging the filter against a wall with the garbage bag tightened around my wrist. I e-mailed the Dirt Devil company to complain but their response was that I should use a soft brush to clean the filter.

Title: Unreliable piece of trash
Content:
I started off really liking this product.  Then the problems started.  The player would hang, then freeze completely and wouldn't even let me turn it off.  I had to use a bent paper clip to press the reset button over and over again.  After about eight months of use, the player wouldn't turn on unless you charged it overnight, and God forbid if you let it go to sleep mode.  Eventually, after about 11 months, it died completely.
And forget getting assistance from Creative Labs.  They won't even speak to you over the phone; you have to run the gauntlet of their unintuitive web site, and they won't deal with you at all if the product is out of warranty.
11 months isn't long enough for a product even one-eighth the cost of this piece of garbage.  Save your money and don't buy Creative.

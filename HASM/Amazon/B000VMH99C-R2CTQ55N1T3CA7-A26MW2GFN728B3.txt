Title: Another Dell Disaster
Content:
I also had the misfortune of purchasing this laptop based on generally favorable reviews. My Inspiron E1705 hard drive crashed within 12-months of purchase destroying all contents.  It was in warranty and Dell fixed it. I assumed the faulty hardware was just a fluke and everything would be fine after the repair. A few months later the AC adapter stopped working. Dell sold me another cable for $100 as it wasn't a "standard" model. Six months later the laptop crashed again once again destroying all contents. Mind you the laptop was lightly used and never left the house.  Rather than taking the professional high road and resolving the problem once and for all, Dell was quick to remind me that laptop was out of warranty.  I spent $1,400 for this?   The next few weeks were a nightmare, including hours of unhelpful scripted technicians, misdirected calls, departmental runarounds, frustrating and incomprehensible foreign accents. After weeks of this, the issue is finally escalated to a supervisor who agrees that Dell products should not fail like this within 18 months.  He promises to call back and correct the problem. He never does. I try again to get through the call center maze again but to no avail.  I gave up and went out and bought a Mac.  The moral: this product comes with low-quality hardware. It is a serious customer risk.  Given Dell's inability to respond to a legitimate customer issue I would say any Dell product is a serious customer risk.  At this juncture I would also be wary of any favorable or fair magazine reviews of their products given their sizable advertising budgets they bring to print and web media.

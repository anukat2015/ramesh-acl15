Title: Great but not Excellent
Content:
I bought my P205-S6237 in August of 2008 and while I like the computer a lot is does have its faults.  First it is a bit slower than many of its competitors and there seem to be some internal conflicts with the Vista operating system and some anti-virus protection programs.  I've also had problems with the Labelflash drive and that had to be replaced under warrenty as it stopped reading and writing DVD's even though it continued to work in CD mode.  Other than that the machine is great.  The screen images are wonderful, I love the key board which has a full keyboard with numeric key pad.  There are other features and diagnostics added by TOSHIBA that make this computer a breeze to maintain compared to many other manufactures.  Would I buy another one??  You bet, at the price vers function end it's a real winner in my book.

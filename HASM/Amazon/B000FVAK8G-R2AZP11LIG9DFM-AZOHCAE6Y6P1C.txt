Title: love the timer, the themometer and it's black!
Content:
We got this for our boys room as even Florida has chilly nights.
I love the themometer bc I know it won't overheat their room.  I love that I can set the timer to turn off in 10hours (around 8am) when they wake up and go off to school, another thing I don't have to remember.
I haven't had any problems with overheating, turning off by itself and we've had it 2 years.
I have broken a wheel but that's my fault. I would by it again.

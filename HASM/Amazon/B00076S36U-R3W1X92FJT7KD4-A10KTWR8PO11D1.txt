Title: buy this heater
Content:
Bought this heater to substitute for central heating during power cuts & in case the furnace broke. Furnace broke this past week, and at 35-45 external temperature we were able to maintain comfortable heat inside (around 65) with this heater and an old electrical heater. Approximately 1,500Sqf, so no complaints. Generates even & pleasant heat with slight kerosene smell at light-up and shut-off but not during run. Would definitely buy again, more effective and cheaper to run than an electrical heater.

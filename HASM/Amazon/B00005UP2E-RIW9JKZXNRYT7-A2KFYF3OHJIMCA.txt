This is the best thing I have ever found to use on my wood laminate floors.  I have dogs, cats, birds and a messy husband. I have to sweep the floor every day, at least once a day and sometimes more.  This canister vac has GREAT suction, picks up all the hairballs, litter and seed with no problems  Even picks up big chunks of dog food and doesn't bust it up and spit it back out all over the place like my old upright did.  It has a very easy to clean hepa filter, easy to empty dirt cup and handy tools.  I also like that the back end of it is closed and there is nothing to blow the stuff on the floor around before I can sweep it up.  Its all sealed up and the air goes through the filter.  The extra long cord is handy and it even has a strap to hang over your shoulder when you use it for curtains and ceiling fans and such.  Its very light weight and moves about on the floor smoothly and easily.  For the money, you just can't beat this one!  Especially with free shipping! I LOVE it!

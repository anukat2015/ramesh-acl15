Title: Needs replacement after 2 ;years
Content:
I got his coffee maker 2 years ago, and it needs replacement because of the leakage from the bottom problem that others have reported.  Also, the coffee never got very hot, even when new. My husband always complained that the coffee didn't start hot and was cold in his travel mug before he got to work. Certainly, the steel carafe reduced the temperature, which should require the maker to brew hotter coffee in the first place; but it does not. 
It looks good, the clock and programming keys function reliably, and the grounds and water were easy to fill for brewing. 
I'm looking for a different brand and model.

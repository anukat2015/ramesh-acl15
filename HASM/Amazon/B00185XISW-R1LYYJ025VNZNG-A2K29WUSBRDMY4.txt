Title: Only warm when you are very close to it.
Content:
Exactly what the instruction says because I read a customer service reply to a reviewer stating that the equipment wasn't set up properly. I installed this back in early November when it wasn't too cold. It seemed to warm up the room without turning the central unit on. Now that the weather is freezing cold outside it doesn't do much to warm us up. When I touch the ceramic tile it's burning hot so I know its working but when you are about 3 feet away you can't tell if it's on or not without looking at the light on the switch. I'm a bit disappointed but my wife says it seems to help in between the time when the central unit is off. If I pay over $100 dollar for a space heater I expect it to warm up at least one room with the door close on a winery night. I guess it would help putting it right next to your bed and risk burning yourself while you are sleeping.

Title: Pleased.. very pleased
Content:
We bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee that we had become displeased with after a year or so.  I was looking for a coffee brewer that made hot coffee and a thermal carafe that would keep it that way for a reasonable amount of time.  I have been very happy with the Zojirushi, with the brew, temperature, and heat retention of the carafe.  So far I have not experienced any problems with spills or the operation of the thermal carafe.  I bought # 4 Melita paper filters and they fit ok, but one does need to press the filter down in the basket well.  I can only speculate that there has been some improvement to the carafe lid grip ridges being too sharp as I do not see it as a problem on mine.  I am happy with the product and would recommend it for this price range($89).

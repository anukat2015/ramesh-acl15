Title: User friendly...THE BEST
Content:
I can't believe all the poor reviews I'm reading. I have iPods for use in my classroom and am currently trying to get that changed to the Microsoft Zune. Not only is it more user friendly, it automatically converts many types of media from video to photo to music. Anything in your Tunesaccount can automatically be added to your Zune then synced. The only downside is there not a specific folder to label Podcasts, but hey not big deal.
It's also very easy to rip music from CDs you already own to later be synced. 
I love the item so much that when a student stole my first one I went home and immediately ordered a new one. I couldn't ask for a better player.

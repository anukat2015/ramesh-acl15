Title: Had Same Model type HFH2985
Content:
RE: Same Model and  type, just I have the HFH2985. I ditto everyone else's complaints about the thermostat and settings make it a lower value than other Holmes products. Is not worth more than 29.99 and is super quiet, but only seems to do best for me on the high power mode. A manufacturing flaw.
I have had mine for over 5 years and it still does heat great. Did not buy it from Amazon, but wish that Holmes would combine the quiet part of this with the other highly rated cheaper models. They work just as good as this one and I have wrote another review about another Holmes (somewhat noisy) which I just bought. It only cost like $26, shipping included.

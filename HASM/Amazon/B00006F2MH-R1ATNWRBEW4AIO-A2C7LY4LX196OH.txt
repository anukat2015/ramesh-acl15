Title: Terribly Weak Coffee
Content:
I rarely take the time to write a bad review about a product, but this thing is just terrible.
First, I should note that I am a fan of super strong coffee, but I am also an extremely "make due" type of person too.  I have not found a way to make coffee in this thing that I find acceptable. 
If I  use the darkest roast of beans from Starbucks with a third the amount of water the manual of this thing suggests, I will get coffee that I find passable.  What an expensive way to make coffee!
I feel like it is a waste of money to use this thing, and I can't for the life of me figure out why it makes such weak coffee, but it sucks and I give up.  I have started using my roommates french press to make coffee, since I threw away my old coffee maker (it cost about twenty bucks and lasted for several years).
I could live with the fact that it is terribly loud and that it is a pain to clean, but to go through all that and have sub-par coffee?  No, thanks.

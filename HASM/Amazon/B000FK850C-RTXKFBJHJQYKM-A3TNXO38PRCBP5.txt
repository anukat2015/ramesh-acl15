Title: Best Electric Heater
Content:
I bought this heater for my living room.  I have central heat and air, but this helps me save money on my heating bill.  It's slightly more expensive than other ceramic heaters, but it has an air purifier and a remote control.  None of the cheaper ceramic heaters have those features.  You don't realize how handy the remote control is unless you have owned an electric heater without one.  You can make minor adjustments to its thermostat with the remote control.  You can adjust the thermostat from 64 to 90 degrees.  It has a big, bright LCD display on the front that shows the temperature and other information.  Many people seem to prefer those electric oil-filled heaters, but some of them can take forever to heat up a room.  This heater produces a lot of heat quickly.  It's rated at 5,200 BTUs.  A small air conditioner has a rating of about 10,000 BTUs.  It also has the ability to automatically alternate between high and low power when it's in AUTO mode.  It doesn't always use 1500 watts of electricity because of that.  Sometimes it will only use 950 watts if a room is already warm.  The Sunpentown SH-1508 is the best electric heater I have ever owned.

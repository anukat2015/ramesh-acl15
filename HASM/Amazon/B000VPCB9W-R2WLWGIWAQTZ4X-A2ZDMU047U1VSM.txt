Content:
This is the 2nd of this heater I've owned.  Output of heat and fan are about the best I've encountered.  I use this one in my bathroom for chilly mornings.  My last one lasted about 3 years, but it was used every day at least for a little while each day.  I would definitely recommend.  Others I've tried just did not compare in the amount of air produced.

Title: Wonderful camera
Content:
I had this camera for over a year and a half before I bought a Canon 7D. I loved it then and still love it. I reluctantly gave it to a son so that it would continue to get full use and bring joy. The only reason I upgraded was:
-- Better high ISO image quality
-- Better AF tracking for birds in flight, one of my primary shooting targets
I'm glad I did. The 7D is a great camera but the body only is $1600. Unless those things truly matter to you (there are other differences too), the XSi is terrific. 
I won't repeat the detailed comments in other reviews but will comment on some other comments:
-- Construction, weight, feel - the 7D is definitely heavier but the XSi felt fine in my hands. One of my primary lenses is the 100-400mm L which weighs 3lbs. I find talk of an unbalanced feel (with any lens) somewhat nonsense at least for my hands. For carrying around, hiking, birding, I wish the 7D was lighter like the XSi.
I was too conservative at shooting only at 400 ISO and below. Pushing higher to 800 is ok when needed.
Purchased the XSi plus some lenses/accessories at Amazon. Have been very happy with them.

Title: Unbelievably Excellent Camera!
Content:
My family loves this camera! I am glad I waited for this. I was tempted to by the XSI from Canon, but when I heard about this one coming out, I waited and thank god I did!
For a first time SLR person, this is the camera that you want to buy. The Video is an added bonus. I am now going to sell my Sony HD camcorder and just use this one.
I also got the 16 gig SDHC card, which you will need if you are going to take pics in 15 meg and use the video.

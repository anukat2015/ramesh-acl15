I recently purchased this unit from Amazon,  When it arrived the packaging was crushed and looked as if it had been returned and resond cause alot of the styrofoam was broken. After unpacking everything was intact with all parts ok. After using it a few weeks the unit is noisy [I use it in my bedroom} and constantly needs to adjust the temp to stay comfortable.  The digital display of your settings is no where near the actual temp.  When the compressor runs it makes clunking sounds and constantly wakes me.  The KW85 makes me wish it was fall!

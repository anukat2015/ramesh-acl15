Title: very good camera
Content:
This review comes from a novice looking to learn more with a good camera.  I really do like this camera but I gave it 4 stars because the automatic setting does NOT allow you to use the display screen to view your shot, you have to use the viewfinder.  I do not know why Canon did this.  In this way it does not function like a typical digital camera - in auto mode.  I believe you can use the display in manual mode, but I am not competent enough (yet) to use that mode.  It is a nice view finder though and accurate.

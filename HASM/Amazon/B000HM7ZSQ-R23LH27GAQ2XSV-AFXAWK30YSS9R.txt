Title: Sturdy but some quality control problems
Content:
The fan arrived without any assembly instructions at all - fortunately it's not hard to figure out.  But also one of the nearly 3/8" thick iron legs had two mounting holes drilled in the wrong places by one-half an inch, so bending the leg and the 1/4" mounting bracket was necessary.  Without a pipe to add leverage this would have been very difficult and it was possible the leg could break where the two mounting holes were since this was the area that needed bending to fit.
I'm using this with another overhead-mounted low-pressure misting system that has somewhat finer droplets than the supplied misting hose.  As another reviewer noted the supplied misting hose that attaches to the fan will get you and anything in the fan's path pretty wet plus the hose length is not that long.  The performance of the fan is fine, even on the lowest setting it cools well (with or without mist) and is fairly quiet.  The construction is sturdy and looks to be able to last for a few years at least, especially if the heavy-duty storage cover (a nice addition) is used.

Title: Terrific little camera
Content:
I bought a D70 about a year ago and was delighted with it from day one. At christmas I bought my son who is an aspiring photographer a D50 with the 18-55 kit lens.
 I cannot tell any difference in the image quality between these two cameras. The D50 is simpler but that is not a bad thing. I find the single command dial to be a nice feature. When you take the camera from A to S mode the function of the dial changes with you making for a very efficient system.
 If you don't do a lot of wirelss flash or feel the need to fiddle with the white balance then there is effectively no difference between the D70 and D50 bodies. 
 When you take a few minutes to look over the specs of the D50 you will find a very powerful picture taking tool. 
 This camera may be simplified to bring down the cost of manufacture but it certianly has not been "dumbed down" to meet a price point.
 I recommend you ignore all the picture modes and concentrate on mastering P A S & M settings. Also exploring the slow sync setting to make flash pictures look more natural will pay off in much nicer photos.
 Great camera and quite a bargain too.

 After eight months I still think this is one terrific little camera and a bargain too. If you do a lot of bakpacking this camera and the 18-200VR lens could be the perfect set up. You won't need the wireless flash of a D70 and the D50 is noticably lighter when out on the trail. It's lighter on your checkbook too. Nice job Nikon.

Title: 10D Discontinued???
Content:
I had a similar experiences to the previous poster from two different camera stores. A Ritz Camera saleswoman in Manassas, VA told me last week that Ritz no longer carries the 10D because it's being phased out in favor of the EOS Digital Rebel. I personally can't stand the Digital Rebel; it's so light it feels like a toy. I travel to remote war-torn parts of the world and need a rugged, dependable camera. I was just about to plunk down my money for a 10D after deciding the 10D was better than the Nikon D100 (for my needs, anyway).  If anyone has more details, please post! Thanks.

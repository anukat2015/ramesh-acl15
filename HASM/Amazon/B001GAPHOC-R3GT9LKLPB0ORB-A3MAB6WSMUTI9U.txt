Title: Great Entry Level DSLR
Content:
If you're looking for a DSLR that focuses on a specific aspect of photography and does it better than any other camera, then you are looking at the wrong camera.  If you are looking for a camera that does it everything well (except video) but doesn't excel in any one category then you should buy it now.  The resolution is perfect, the camera shoots in RAW DNG format, and the kit lens and flash are adequate for someone starting out with their first DSLR.  Why did I choose Pentax over a bigger name like Nikon or Canon.  In-body shake reduction vs. in lens shake reduction.  Add in the fact that I grew up shooting on a fully manual Pentax film body (I'm 26 and shot mostly with an ME and an MX), and I think you'll understand.
Though they might not get as much press as Nikon, Canon, or some of the other big names Pentax is still a brand to be reckoned with, with a lot of avid supporters.  If you choose this as your first DSLR, you won't be disappointed.

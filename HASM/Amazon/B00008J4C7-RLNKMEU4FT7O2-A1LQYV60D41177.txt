Title: It cleaned up pretty well
Content:
My fiance gave me this vacuum cleaner. He didn't use it so he let me have it. I had it for I would say less than a year. It worked pretty good....before it died. It picked up all the junk on the floor except it had a hard time picking up hair. It would just roll it into a bunch so I had to pick it up myself. But it did a good job sucking up the dust and dog dander. I like the fact that it was bagless ( no doggy odor) Usually when you use the ones with the bags the minute you turned it on you would smell DOG!!! It was a great little vacuum.. only problem that I did not like was I prefer my vacuum cleaners to be upright... not like HANDY DANDY VACUUM CLEANERS!!. They're alot easier on your back when they're upright as opposed to this kind.

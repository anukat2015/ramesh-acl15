Title: Useless; returned it
Content:
I rarely return items but this one goes back.
The plus: it's small.  
The downsides:
* it's dials don't make sense and don't seem to do much
* AND it did not throw off good heat; my feet were 4 inches away from it and I still couldn't get warm!  I could always touch the device easily as it was only warm to the touch.
AVOID.

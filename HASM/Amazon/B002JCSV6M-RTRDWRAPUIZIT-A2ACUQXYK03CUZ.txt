Title: Fantastic Camera!!
Content:
I still own my Nikon D60 but decided to move up to a D300s after researching online at several of my forums and the Nikon website. Since it's arrival, I have been extremely impressed with the the build quality,image quality and flexibility in control of the image making process. In fact the camera is extremely complex and does require a steep learning curve to master. The camera can still be set up as a "point and shoot" for family snapshots but allows many creative image controls for the professional in all of us. Just a great camera!!

Content:
I bought this item and was really pleased with it once I got used to it.  It was awkward at first but once I got the  hang of it I actually enjoyed using it and it seemed to take less time then mopping. I was shocked to see how dirty the water was when I got done using this.  I had moped my floors only a few days prior to using the Bissell and the water was filthy.  Apparently it does a better job then I do.

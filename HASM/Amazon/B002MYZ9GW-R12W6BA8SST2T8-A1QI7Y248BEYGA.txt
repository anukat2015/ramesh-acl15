Title: Junk - Don't let the price fools you. AVOID!
Content:
I purchased two of these units based on some limited research online and advertised descriptions from the manufactures. Shipping and handling from Amazon via Target were fast and professional, as usual. However, these Whynter Air Cooler/Heater/Humidifier units have serious manufacture defects to include design problems and cheap materials. First to notice was the Oscillate louvers making screeching noise right out of the box. Next was the abnormal noises inside the unit even when it is turned off. The noise sounds like parts are still moving even after I had turned the power off for hours. The only way I could stop the noise or the moving parts was to unplug it. Most annoying of all and can even be deadly was the "burnt paint" smell when the heater was on. This burnt paint odor persists long after the had been turned off for hours... 
These units are being returned and are on their way back to Target. A full refund is expected; however, as for the Whynter brand name, it just made my Not-to-buy list for life.

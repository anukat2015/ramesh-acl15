Title: Reviewer has a good point, HEPA of very poor design
Content:
The Reviewer makes an excellent point!  This unit will not provide HEPA filtration of exaust air.  So if you are buying this unit due to allergies or based on the procaimed HEPA filtration you would do best to pass this unit up.  However as a normal vacuum, the unit is very good. Due to its small size it is very easy to manuver through tight spots.  Suction is very good as well as the power head.  The hose is of poor quality and tends to kink, but all in all a good vacuum.  They just shouldn't claim HEPA filtration as the previous reviewer (mictrik) has pointed out so well.  These days it isn't hard to find vacuums with HEPA filtration so passing this unit up wont be to big of a loss.  Fix this issue and Bissell would have a true star.

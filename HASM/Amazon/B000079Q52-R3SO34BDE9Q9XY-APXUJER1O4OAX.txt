Title: Low cost maintenace, HIGH heat
Content:
I bought this for my mother(82) last fall for use while she watches television.  She loves the radiant heat.  It has proved to be a low cost maintenance heater yet gives out a great deal of heat.  She starts on high but can only take the heat for a short time, reduces to low for an hour or so.  She can have much more comfortable evenings and I don't have to worry about her trying to save money on her utility bills.  One thing you should know.  My mother has carpeting all through her home.  While the heater is really safe, it is VERY sensitive to the unevenness of the carpeting.  She had trouble turning it on and sometimes it wouldn't stay on.  I simply bought her a heavy slate tile from the tile store($4.00) a bit larger than the base of the heater and problem is solved.  It looks nice too!  I'm buying a smaller one for my use in the bathroom.  I just LOVE hot baths in really hot rooms!

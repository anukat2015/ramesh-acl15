Title: If you're at high altitude and want hot coffee, this is the way to go!
Content:
Yes its not cheap. I ordered this for my dad's cabin - he's at 9,000 feet. Only way to get coffee hot. I've also used it at 7,000 feet elevation and it works well there also - far better than just your standard coffee maker (if you live in Colorado, this is sad but true). 
The water is preheated before you put in the coffee grinds so you get hot coffee every time. Highly recommended for good coffee if you're up in the mountains.

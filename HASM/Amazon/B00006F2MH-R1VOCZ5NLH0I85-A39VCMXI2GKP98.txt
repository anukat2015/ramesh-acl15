Title: Works for Me!
Content:
I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this coffeemaker because the reviews seemed very mixed.  However, I have had it for a couple of months now and my husband and I both love it.  It is true that the grinding noise is rather loud, so that might be a problem if you sleep next to the kitchen.  But otherwise it functions flawlessly.  I love how easily it disassembles for cleaning.  I think it is designed very well indeed and would recommend it highly.

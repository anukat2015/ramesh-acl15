Title: Magnificient item
Content:
I purchased my vacuum in 2008.  When I received it I couldn't wait to give it a try.  It was better than I expected.  It picked up so some dust from the floor, even after I had swept the floor with the broom.  The only draw-back was the attachments.  They don't stay on when you are vacuuming furniture.  I would highly recommend this item.

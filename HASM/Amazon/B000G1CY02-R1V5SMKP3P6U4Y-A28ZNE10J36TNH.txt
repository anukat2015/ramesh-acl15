Title: Not as Advertised.
Content:
Do not buy this product:
1) If you want to use in bathroom.  Although description implies that you can use in the bathroom, the manual, and the help line, both state unequivocally that it is dangerous to use near water.  Amazon should change the product description.
2) If you actually want to heat a room.  I'm amazed at how little heat actually comes out of this unit.  As many have noted, sure, if you stand over it with a blanket to keep in the heat.  But if that is the case, I would rather wrap up with my wife.
3) Customer service was slow.  Multiple calls and long waits.
One star.  Very disappointing.  Sure, we kept it.  I might be able to use in garage.  Easier to eat the money than send it back.

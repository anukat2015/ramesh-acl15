Title: Sleek,Sharp, And Quick
Content:
Im originally a windows user but after awhile I decided to see what the big deal was with the mac.
3 Concerns I had:
Compatibility with Windows Products - Not a problem considering you can run parallels and dual boot windows xp,vista, and even 7.
Speed- 2.8ghz is fast and it runs adobe photoshop cs4 perfectly with no lag whatsoever. The apple website also allows you to upgrade it to 3.06ghz which is :0.
Durability and customer service & repair - The new body design on this is very sleek and slim feels amazing and not flimsy or anything. OKAY the biggest thing that impressed me was how fast and helpful customer service and repairs are. I plugged my apple headphones from my iphone into the jack and for some reason the speakers blew out, I called and got it shipped later that day and received it before the week was even over.  The mac overall is very neat and if you are savy with technology there is alot more things you can do to unlock the macs Inner powers

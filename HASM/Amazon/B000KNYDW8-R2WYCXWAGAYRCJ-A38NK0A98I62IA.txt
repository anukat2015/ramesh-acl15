Title: No hire, Haier!
Content:
Have been running it for a week. Here are my observations:
1) This unit is loud. I mean it, it's LOUD!!! Even when running at minimal speed, with "energy saving" mode on. Not sure how many decibels (db) it pumps out, but it's pretty close to my vacuum cleaner. In a 200 sq.ft. room, you won't be able to sleep or watch TV or conduct a conversation with this air conditioner on, granted!
2) It doesn't cool our room (280 sq.ft) well. They say it's 8,000 BTU. Well, I would subjectively say it's closer to 6,000 than 8,000. The outcoming air is just marginally cooler than the room air. Also, the internal temperature sensor is off by about 5 degrees. Right now it shows 68'F, perhaps to look good and show that the A/C is doing it's job... However my wall room thermometer stands 72'F! Well, here in the U.S, we call this cheating. Big no-no.
Bottom line: we're returning this one back, even though we got it cheap, with 30% off the price sticker. Well, now I know why... you get what you pay.

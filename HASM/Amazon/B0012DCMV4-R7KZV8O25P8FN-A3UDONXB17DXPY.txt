Title: Do Not Buy
Content:
I bought one of these last year. However, I did not buy it from this sight or on the internet. The following is a copy of the letter I wrote to the company about their product:
To whom it may concern,
 
I purchased one of your ConfortZone CZ1500 heaters last January. Based on the sales pitch I received, I was under the impression that this heater would heat a 1000 square foot area at half the cost of my current system. (I have electric baseboard heat) I had my doubts but I went ahead and bought into the scam and purchased one of the heaters.
 
After 1 year of use and comparing my heating bills, I found out that it cost more per/month to run your product (with my baseboard heat) and it will NOT heat a 1000 square foot area on it's own. SURPRISE!!!!!  If I add the $1/day (the claim your sales rep said it would cost to run your product) to my current/old electric bill, I don't think that ads up to any kind of savings. Do you??? It also can't even keep up heating a 13' X 20' room without the additional use of my baseboard heat. Unless you like a nice cool area and wearing a coat.
 
I'm not sure how your company can make the kind of claims it does and stay in business or get the approval from anyone like the better business bureau.
 
After recieving my next electric bill, I have shut off your heater trying to save the $30 per/month it was costing to run it. If I'm lucky, I might even save more by turning it off.
PS
Based on some other reviews I've read on the internet, I'm not the only one who's been ripped off. The word is out and be assured I will keep it going. Have a nice day.

Title: DTC-975 Cuisnart Thermal Coffeemaker
Content:
This coffeemaker looks great but it constantly overflows even when the so-called "patented lid" is screwed on correctly.  The overflow problem is more common when you brew 8 or more cups; it does not seem to happen when you brew a small amount.  Also, the "brew pause" feature does not always work.  To make matters worse, when it overflows, the filter basket holder cannot be detached from the machine so you have to clean the holder with q-tip to remove the grinds from the creases. 
We have a lot of Cuisinart products and this is the first one that is simply awful.

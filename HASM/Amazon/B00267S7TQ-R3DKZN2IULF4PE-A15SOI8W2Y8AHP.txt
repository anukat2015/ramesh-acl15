Title: Nice Upgrade from my Nikon D40
Content:
This is an excellent DSLR despite a recall. I upgraded from Nikon D40 and this camera takes great pictures, amazing low light performance, the battery life is amazing although I got an extra battery. It has some additional features which the D40 doesn't have like the Active D-lighting, Exposure Bracketing, 11 Point AF System etc. The live view, swivel screen and the video mode is plus though I don't use these features often. They should have made the display screen to be 920K resolution rather than the 230K resolution but I am still happy with my purchase.
Before buying my camera, I made sure with the seller that the stock they have are not part of their recall. Make sure you do this before you buy from any retailer.

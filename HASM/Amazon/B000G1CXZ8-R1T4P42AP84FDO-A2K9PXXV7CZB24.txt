Title: Lousy thermostat
Content:
Product manual states a 3.6 degree difference between on and off which is too large of a difference, set it for 68 deg and it doesn't shutoff until 72. I bought this for my bathroom, it is either to hot or to cold, and when it does finally shutoff at setpoint the thermometer climbs a few more degrees, i think the temp sensor is affected by the air being drawn into the unit. I bought it specifically for the thermostat feature and it is terrible and  will be returning to costco.

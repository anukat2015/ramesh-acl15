Title: Just terrific
Content:
It's not cheap, but for a Miele it's a good value, and I predict it will last as long as several cheaper vacuum cleaners combined. The air in my apartment feels noticably cleaner after a few weeks (I have wall to wall carpet).
PROS: Very quiet (for a vacuum cleaner). This makes it MUCH more pleasant to use. Very solid build quality. Smaller and lighter, yet far more powerful, than any I've owned. Easier to use than an upgright because you only have to move the hose. Adjustable speed is nice for rugs.
CONS: None really.

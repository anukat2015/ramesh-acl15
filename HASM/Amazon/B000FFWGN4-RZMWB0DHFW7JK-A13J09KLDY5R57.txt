Title: Disappointed
Content:
I bought it and the first week it was great. The longer I use it however, the worse the suction gets. Even when you clean the filters (all of them) its still poor. The suction on mine got so bad it wouldn't even turn the pet brush attachment. I finally took it apart to clean the tube from the tank to hose and it worked a little better, even though there was nothing much there!?! Not sure why that worked. Also, I hate the mess when you empty the container plus it holds next to nothing. Go with a bag or if you are lucky and building a house get a Central vacuum!! You won't regret it.

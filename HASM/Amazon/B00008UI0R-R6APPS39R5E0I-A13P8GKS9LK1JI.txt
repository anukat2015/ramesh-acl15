Title: Good deal!
Content:
I did a lot of research and found this vacuum has the most bells and whistles for the most reasonable price. I've had it for about 2 months now and I love it! The only drawback is the small dust bin, but it can always be emptied so its no big deal for me. If you have dust allergies this may be a problem as you are exposed to a small amount of dust as you empty it, but this is true of all bagless vacs. And its easy to dump, easy to clean, even the roller brush is easy to clean with a small scissors. I love the mini roller too, so cute.

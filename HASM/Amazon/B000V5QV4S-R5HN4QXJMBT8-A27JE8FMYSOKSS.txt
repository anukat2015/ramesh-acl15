Title: Phenomenal Camera!
Content:
Amazing upgrade to my beloved 10D.  The 3" review screen is an amazing asset in the field to make sure each shot is perfect.  The LiveView feature makes it possible to preview a shot in various modes prior to taking the shot.  Allows you to get the exact shot you are looking for before you even release the shutter.  The clarity is amazing even at a poster-print size.  A definite recommendation for any mid-level pro-sumer.  A great upgrade to previous Canon DSLRs.

Title: Versatile and Handy
Content:
This hose is extremely useful when coupled to the matching 8" blower.  I use it to exhaust smoke, fumes, etc. from my garage when I'm wood or metal-working.  The flexibility means that I can put the blower anywhere and direct the suction to where I'm working.  There are four rings sewn in to the outside that can be used to suspend the hose (or hold it to a wall or floor).
On Halloween, you can fill the duct with white lights and make a 20' long glowing orange worm or path marker.

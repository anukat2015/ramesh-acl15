Title: Pretty good PC
Content:
It's not very fast but it gets the job done.  I use it mainly to grab pictures as shot with my Canon 5D and 5D MK2 when in the field.  It has built-in wireless so I can connect in my hotel for emailing and internet.  Plenty of storage for even a 2 or 3 day shooting assignment.  I loaded the Canon software and Gimp for some quick image adjusting. It has plenty of connectivity and comes with Windows XP so no Vista mysteries.

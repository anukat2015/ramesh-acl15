Title: Not an Ipod 1 gb but a knockoff mp3 player
Content:
I wanted an Ipod 1 gb shuffle but got a knockoff that was an mp3 player. This is why when I plugged it inot my computer the itunes did not recognize this mp3 player. With some reasearch I saw many knoockoffs online that were made to look like shuffles but had the workings of an mp3 player. I reformatted the mp3 which rendered it usless abecause I didn't know it was other than an aplle product. So they gave me full refund but I was dissappointed just the same. Now I am a little apprenhensive to order used items.

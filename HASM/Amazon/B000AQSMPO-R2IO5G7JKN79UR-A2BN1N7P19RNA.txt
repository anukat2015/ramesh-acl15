Title: New unit is sooooo very QUIET !!
Content:
As many reviewers have noted, these brewers have been notoriously noisy. However, Keurig appears to have finally addressed the issue. This is the third unit I have owned in the past two years, and whereas the first two could be heard across the house and vibrated enough to rattle other items on the counter, this new one barely makes a sound. The new pump design makes a faint purring noise and doesn't so much as tremble. I have loved the convenience and taste from this coffee maker so much I was willing to put up with the racket, but now I wholeheartedly  recommend this unit. My only warning is this: echoing other reviewers, the heater on my previous unit failed after 20 months of daily use (6-8 cups per day), so I shelled out for a square trade warranty this time.

Title: It just works!
Content:
Its easy to see why they say it just works - because it does! I finally decided to swap to a Macbook after all these years as a windows user. Very happy I did! Its a great machine, so light, nice clear display, the battery life is amazing, and of course like all apple products - it just looks nice! If you are deciding whether to make the switch or not, just do it, you will not regret it.

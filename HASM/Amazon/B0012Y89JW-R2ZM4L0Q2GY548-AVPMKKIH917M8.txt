Title: Love my Rebel xsi!
Content:
This is my first digital SLR.  Long time ago I had a regular SLR and a strong photography hobby.  For the past 10 years I have used various digital point and shoot cameras.  Loved digital photography, computer editing, no wasted film, etc, but was not really inspired.  I sure am NOW!  My camera came (as of this writing) two days ago.  I love everything about it.  I have small hands and it is easy to hold this camera.  Heavier by far than what I have been used to, but I ADORE it.  A VIEW FINDER!  Goodbye little screens I can't see in daylight.  Hello nose smudges on the screen (lol.)

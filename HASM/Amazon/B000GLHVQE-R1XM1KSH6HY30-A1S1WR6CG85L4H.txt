Title: Great product for the price
Content:
This stove is great for centralized heat when you want that  "cozy" feeling and the ambiance of a real fire.Its economical and does heat a small room quickly.
I bought it for my mother in law who endures MAINE winters but it could be used in any climate to get that quick warm up,such as a cabin,outside patio,or garage.

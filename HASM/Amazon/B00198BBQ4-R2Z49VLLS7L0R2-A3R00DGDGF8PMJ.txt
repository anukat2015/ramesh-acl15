Title: Defective graphics
Content:
The 1525 series has built-in graphics chips that you can't change or upgrade.  That would be one thing a consumer could choose to live with...except this configuration is defective.
It will fail...routinely, consistently and relentlessly.  Unfortunately for me I spent the first month transferring files from my old machines and working almost exclusively online and with office applications.  By the time I got around to using programs that were even minimally graphics intensive it was already past the point where Dell would let me swap it for another model.
This model makes me miss my old 6000!
Buyer beware!

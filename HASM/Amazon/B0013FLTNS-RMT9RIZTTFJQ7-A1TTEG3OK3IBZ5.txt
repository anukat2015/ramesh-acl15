Title: First Mac Purchase and Not Dissappointed
Content:
This was my first venture into the Apple realm and I honestly can say that I am not disappointed. 
I am starting a new project where I will be shooting alot of video and I decided to get a MacBook Pro to do the editing. 
iMovie08 is as easy as everyone said it would be to use. The transition from Windows to Mac was not nearly as hard as I thought ( I still use a Windows Box as well). 
You can view my video's I created at www.vimeo.com/jvreeland

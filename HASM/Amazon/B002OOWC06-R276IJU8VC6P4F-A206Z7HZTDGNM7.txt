Title: Very pleased with this laptop
Content:
I bought this laptop after significant research.  In the end, part of the reason I picked it is that it was one of the few ultra-thin/light computers that I could actually find in a store to try out.  Oh - and it was red. 
Seriously though, I have been really happy with the laptop. I just took it on a 2-week business trip and carried it with me to all meetings in a shoulder bag and didn't regret having it with me.  It was so light, and lasted 6-7 hours each day without recharging.
My only complaints are as follows:
- the keyboard seems a little cheap.  It works fine, but not the best keyboard I have used.
- sound.  I knew it before I bought it, but even after raising the sound as suggested on other review boards, it still has pretty low sound.  You need a very quiet space if you want to skype and hear everything.
- scratches.  It took almost nothing to scratch the plastic cover.  I'm sad that the shiny cover is scratched so quickly.  But I'll get over it. 
- mouse touch pad.  It is a little over-sensitive, and I end up closing things or deleting things by accident.  I'll get used to it eventually.
No regrets.  I'm happy with this computer and like the Toshiba Bulletin Board feature.

Title: Quite Dissapointed
Content:
I should preface this by noting what I like my coffee maker to do: brew strong coffee.  This unit cannot accept the volume of ground coffee necessary to do that, & produce a limp cup as a result.  Worse, the grounds mound up into the water element, & cleaning is difficult.  And good luck removing the grounds from the basket without a mess.  The water reservoir has a small entry, & so don't try filling when you haven't had your 1st cup yet (oh my, think of the dilema!).  The carbon filter broke on the 1st install, & overall, a poor quality coffee maker.  This was to replace a Mr. Coffee unit I'd had for the office for 10yrs.  The drain flap on that finally gave way, but hey, it's been 10yrs of hard use.  I will not buy any more Cuisinart products.
All I want is a strong cup with no mess, is that too much to ask?

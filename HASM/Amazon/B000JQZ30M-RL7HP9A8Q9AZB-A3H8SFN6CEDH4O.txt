Title: Great heater and attractive design
Content:
Very happy with this purchase. I previously owned the Lasko 755320 Tower Heater with Remote. That one lasted about 5 years and when it was time to replace it, I purchased this one, Lakso 6410.
The reasons I got this one instead is that for me personally, I found the remote unnecessary and never used it.
This one heats just as well as the Lasko Tower with Remote, takes up less space, more attractive design and cost less.
Many people have ask questions regarding increase in electric bill. I have found that if you do not use the oscillating function you will not see much of an increase in your electric bill.
But with using the oscillating function you will see a bigger increase in electric bill. Not sure why it cost so much more to oscillate but that has been my experience.
Basically when running this heater my gas bill has decreased by 70.00 and electric has increased 20.00.
So overall it saves me about 50.00/month. But it not only saves me money every month it also increases the temperature in my home to a nice, toasty, comfortable level without the fear of a HUGE gas bill.
Just remember, nothing can replace a little weather stripping around your doors/windows and sealing off drafty spots to keep the warm in and cold out.
But Lasko heaters are a great and dependable product that will help increase the temperature inside your home at a minimal cost. Ceramic heaters cost less to run that regular electric heaters, always get ceramic.

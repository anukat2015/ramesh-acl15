Title: Terrible suction. Starting to fall apart
Content:
I have used this vacuum for awhile now and am very unhappy with it. I'll never buy another Hoover.  The suction is very weak. The brush and internal cannister get clogged with hair and lint very easily (very messy to clean). I have also had trouble with the control buttons -- not being able to get it to the proper suction level, not responding by turning off when I press the off button, etc. This vacuum is a pain. Stay away.

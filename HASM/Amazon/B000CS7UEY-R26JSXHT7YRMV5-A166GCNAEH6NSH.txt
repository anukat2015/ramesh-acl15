Title: Freedom!!!!
Content:
Freedom from iTunes and the Nazi-like Apple rules. The software that the Zen comes with is amazing and simple. Songs, videos, and pics are an easy click & drag loading. 
You can also move the Zen from computer to computer. Meaning, unlike the iPod, the Zen is a 2-way street. Pack up 7000 songs from your computer and copy every single song to any other computer, even without the software. Just the same way an external hard drive works.
Speaking of external hard drive, you can partition up to 16 gigs of the 30 gig hard drive to act as a storage drive for any fyle type, to move files from computer to computer easily.
Choose from 6 different menu themes, and even use your own pics as your background. 
Album art is easy click and drag style, and you can browse through the Zen by album cover, as if you were thumbing through real cd cases rather than just text.
I used to own a video iPod and comparred to the Zen, it's like comparing a scoop of vanilla ice cream to a fully loaded banana split sundae.

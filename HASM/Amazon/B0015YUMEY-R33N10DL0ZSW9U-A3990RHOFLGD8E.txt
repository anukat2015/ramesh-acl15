Title: Quick off the line, get the Speck Case for it
Content:
Speck MacBook Pro 15" See-Thru Hard Case - BLACK - Fits all versions of 15" MacBooks
4GB 667MHz 2x2GB PC25300 DDR2 Fully Buffered ECC DIMM Memory Modules Kit Apple Mac Pro
Brenthaven Pro 15-17 Backpack for MacBook Pro and Powerbook 15-17"
VMware Fusion
The MacBook Pro is a great investment at these prices.  I upgraded from a Dell M1210 (with nVIDIA video) to this machine.  Not looking back!  It runs a 1vcpu Windows XP and 1vcpu Ubuntu VM in VMware Fusion with no problem.
Few things, get 4GB of ram and get the speck case.

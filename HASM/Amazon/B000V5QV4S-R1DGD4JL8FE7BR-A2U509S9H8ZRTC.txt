Title: Upgraded and happy
Content:
I am an amatuer photographer and previously owned the Rebel XT and absolutely loved it.  I wanted something to keep up with my growing son as well as my abilities.  So far I really love this camera.  Unfortunately, my son has been on the move double time so I've had little time to play with it in the past 3 weeks that I had it.  It has met all the expectations I've read in the reviews.  I do agree that having a decent lens will reap the full benefits from this camera.

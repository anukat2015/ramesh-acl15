Title: After a Year.........
Content:
I bought this camera almost a year ago and it has been great! This is my first SLR, always had a point and shoot and it has served me well with over 2500 pictures taken. Not all of them have been great but I suppose that is me, not the camera! by the way I used a Canon EF 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 II USM lens instead of the kit lens and highly recommend it also.......

Title: GREAT little heater!!
Content:
Great heater!!! I just received this in the mail yesterday and started using it last night and have been today as well. So far it's been great! I'm using it to heat my living room which is fairly small, 10' by 13'. Barely any noise is produced by it:-) Also, it has a handle to move it around easier:-)
The only downside is that the thermostat doesn't work on mine. My boyfriend has an $80.00 Lasko Ceramic Heater and it's thermostat doesn't work either. Maybe it's just a Lasko issue? The thermostat not working is not an issue for me though. I don't mind turning down the heat or turning up the heat manually. Also, you have to unplug it to turn it off. Again, doing it manually is not an issue for me, but I can see how that would be an issue if it was plugged in in a hard to reach spot.
Overall, if you're looking to spend little but get a good amount of heat with minimal noise, this is a great heater. It's awesome for college students like me who live in small duplexes, houses, or apartments and don't have the money to spend on an expensive heater but want a good amount of heat to stay warm!:-)

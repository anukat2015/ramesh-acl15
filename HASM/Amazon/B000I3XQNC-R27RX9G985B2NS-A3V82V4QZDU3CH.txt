Title: Great starter kit for a photography major
Content:
I purchased this for my daughter who is a photography major, and she is thrilled with it. She asked for this one after getting recommendations from her professors and they all suggested this camera. I also purchased a zoom lens kit at the same time and still came out under $800 - much less than the $1000+ I expected. I have a feeling I will be researching even more lenses soon though!

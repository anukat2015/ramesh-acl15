Title: HUGE Disappointment!
Content:
We are serious coffee drinkers and bought this coffee pot expecting quality coffee.  Unfortunately, we have been unable to get a good cup of coffee, despite the use of fresh, quality coffee beans that are ground just before use.  While the flavor is OK, the coffee is luke warm and gets cold soon after brewing.  This purchase was a HUGE disappointment and a waste of money.  I would not recommend this coffee pot to anyone.

Title: Excellent heater
Content:
Though a little more pricey than the VH2 and the AVH2 I really like the fact that it has a digital thermostat. It definitely heats my room in my house which is 12'x20' in roughly 10 minutes or so depending on how cold it already was in the room. It has great safety features so I don't have to worry about fires or anything. It is ridiculously quiet which is nice as it is never annoying however it does make it harder to remember to turn it off when I leave the room. It's a great product that works.
What helped me the most when deciding to get the DVTH and the VH2 was Vornado's website which compared the two [...]
In a nutshell, the DVTH (this unit) has a digital thermostat, adjusts the output based on desired temp rather than just turning off and on, and yeah it uses numeric values rather than high low and medium values and such. I like knowing the exact temp in the room and telling the vornado what temp I want the room and forget about it rather than play around with high medium low or I think the AVH2 which has a turn dial thermostat. 
Bottom line, this product is good and I've never owned the other vornados so I only know as much about them as I've researched through customer reviews and product descriptions. The DVTH works and is great, and really heats the room evenly and well. As for everything else I said, take with a grain of salt.

Title: fantastic for the price!
Content:
i ordered the dell mini 9 in pink, and though it took a month longer than it should have to ship, it was well worth the wait!
i thought about ordering an external hard drive for this, and glad i didnt.  i ordered it with 8 gig internal hd and it runs very smoothly.  i dont plan on loading music on it, im sure that would slow it down a bit.
the only concern i have is the , . and / keys.  most of the time when i try to type . i end up hitting / and it gets a bit annoying.  beyond that, this is a great laptop!

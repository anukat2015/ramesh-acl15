Title: Best coffeemaker I've ever bought!
Content:
I don't normally write reviews, but after seeing some of the negative ones here I felt compelled to defend my beloved Capresso coffemaker! I'm a hardcore coffee drinker...I grind my Kenya AA beans every morning and love great coffee. Until I bought my Capresso, I didn't realize that my prior coffee makers didn't make the very best coffee. My Capresso makes awesome coffee. The arguments that the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hot are bogus. My coffee stays hot for easily 4 hours. Most coffee makers have the pot sitting on a hot plate which diminishes the taste of the coffee as the hours go by. With the Capresso, the coffee stays in an insulated carafe, remains hot, and ever cup tastes the same...great. Sure, 10 hours later the pot will have luke warm coffee in it. You can zap it in the microvawe and it will taste as good as the first cup.It's easy to use, makes great coffee, and looks great in the kitchen. I've previously owed two Krups models. There is no comparison. I will never own anything but a Capresso!

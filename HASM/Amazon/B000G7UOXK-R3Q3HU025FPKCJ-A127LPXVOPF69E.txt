Title: HORRIBLE!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!
Content:
We bought one of these (Not from Amazon) and it is as bad and worse as all these reviews say. The water is not contained in a tank it is just poured directly into the base of the unit and ours had a hairline crack where the foot-caster was attached. So we returned it for another. We opened it up at the store and inspected it  - looked fine. We got home and filled it with water and it started leaking all over the floor from two separate new hairline cracks. We will be returning this second one today and looking for something entirely different.

Title: A wolf in sheep's clothing
Content:
The perfect vacuum is a chinese knock-off of an electrolux machine made 15 years ago. The machine is not worth $100.00. It is cheaply made, prone to failure and being marketed as a high end machine. Don't be fooled by the suggested list price and its appearance. It is being made and imported from china by Nationwide onn Long Island. The hose, power nozzle, and machine are subject to a high degree of failure. If you want to purchase a good machine, buy an Aerus/electrolux vacuum. The Perfect vacuum is imperfect and the people who manufacture, distribute and sell this machine are doing a diservice to every consumer looking for quality.

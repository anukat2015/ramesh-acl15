Title: Good Powerful Heater
Content:
I bought this heater to help save on the gas bill this winter.  It seems to be a good powerful little heater.  I am using it in the living area and right away noticed a difference in temperature.  The oscillating feature is nice and so is the remote control unit.  There does not seem to be much of a difference in noise level between the high and low setting, but is fairly quiet.  All in all a good heater for the money.

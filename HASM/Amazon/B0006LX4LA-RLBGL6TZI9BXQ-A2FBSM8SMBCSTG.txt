Title: Makes coffee taste like you licked a 9-volt battery
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for about three months...and yes all the things people complain about are true: hard to poor, spout drips, condensation on the flip cover, messy, etc.  But to be fair all coffee makers (or any appliance for that matter) have their little nuances.  I could forgive all of these shortcomings but what I can't forgive is the taste.  The coffee taste like it's been in a stale rusty canteen for six months.  From the very first cup the metal taste obliterates any subtle flavors the coffee has.  I assume it is a result of a stainless carafe that is not lined with glass.  I (or my wife) am in no way a coffee snob but we can't stand that metal taste.  I don't understand why more people haven't addressed this issue in their reviews.  We are looking to replace this machine ASAP.  
Otherwise, general quality is quite good.  I think if we could replace the carafe with a glass one this would be a good little coffee maker.

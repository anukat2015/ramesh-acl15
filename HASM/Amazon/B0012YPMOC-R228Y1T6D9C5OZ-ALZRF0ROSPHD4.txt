Title: So far so good.
Content:
I purchased the Zen after looking at many different mp3 players. I previously owned the Creative Zen touch and one day it stopped working, needless to say I was very unhappy. Anyways, so far so good with this one. I've had to reset it 2 times, not sure why, but I love the color screen, the music sounds great, over all a good product. The program for putting songs on there is okay. I don't like that its only drag and drop for each different folder I create and some files attach random pictures to songs so its hard to get rid of them with the program. I like the Creative Zen Touch program, all the songs, genres, artists, etc. could be viewed in one window.

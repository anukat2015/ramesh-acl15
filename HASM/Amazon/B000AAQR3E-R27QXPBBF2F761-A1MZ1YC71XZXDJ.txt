Title: Good vacuum
Content:
Miele has been a trusted name for years, but expensive.  But, much better than the Electrolux vacuum.  I was disappointed at how short the electrical cord is.  But can pick up kitty litter and dust-bunnies very, very well.  Buyer beware...where it states that it's being shipped from, is not the place where it comes from and also the parquet brush is NOT included.  I bought the vacuum because of this and I have hardwood floors.  It comes with the brush for tile, marble, garnite, etc.  Not for use on a hardwood floor.  I had to spend another $50.00 for the parquet brush that is mentioned in the description for wood floors.  Even calling Best-vacuum (where the vacuum ended up coming from) they sent me the wrong brush.

Title: Delonghi's 6707E for $20 less
Content:
This is one of the best radiator oil-filled heaters Delonghi offers, this one is under the Kenwood brand name, but it is identical to Delonghi's 6707E, the manual admits as much showing Delonghi's information on the back.  I'm a fan of these radiator heaters, I couldn't stand my forced air system and instead got myself a few of these to get me through the winter.  The unit has a thermostat instead of the usual hot/cold dial, which is a real winner for me.

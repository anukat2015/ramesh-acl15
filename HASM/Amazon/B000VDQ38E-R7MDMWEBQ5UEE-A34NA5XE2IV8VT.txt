Title: works great when you keep the upper cyclone chamber clean
Content:
I purchased this vaccum at the suggestion of my daughter who has 2 dogs and was amazed at the amount of pet hair this sweeper sucks up. You can sweep the floor with a regular vacuum and then run the Pet Eraser over the same area and  pick up more dirt. Amazing. I clean the lower chamber and foam filter after each use. Its been over a year and it wasn"t sounding right . I got out the manual and discovered a filter in the side and the suggestion to clean out the upper cyclone chamber and baffles. When I took everything apart, it was full of dirt. I cleaned it out, replaced the filter and the vacuum is good as new and does a superb job of cleaning up after my 2 cats. I suggest you clean that upper chamber out at least once a month. I didn"t know any better.

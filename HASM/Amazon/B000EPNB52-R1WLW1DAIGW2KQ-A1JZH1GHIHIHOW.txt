Title: 12 stars. Honestly
Content:
Form meets durability, meets looks, meets price, and even re-meets iPod mini(!) in this, the second incarnation of the iPod nano line. The colors (blue especially!) are beautiful and even more vibrant than those of the second-generation mini, not to mention the trademark nano color screen. Somehow, even with the new, stunning metal enclosure, the new nano is 0.01 inch thinner and 0.09 ounce lighter than the first. And the new price for the increased durability, battery life, and storage capacity hermetically seals the deal. A personal music player cannot possibly get more comprehensively.... NICE, than this. It's EXACTLY what the nano should have been all along.

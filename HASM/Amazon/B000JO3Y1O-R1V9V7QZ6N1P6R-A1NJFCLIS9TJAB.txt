Title: Mine went back
Content:
I returned my Touch after one day because I realized that the Wi-Fi store is not set up for podcasts.  Podcasting is an essential feature for me, and if I cannot do it wirelessly on the Touch I can just stick with my old Ipod.  When they add podcasts I will try again.  Maybe the next generation will be better.

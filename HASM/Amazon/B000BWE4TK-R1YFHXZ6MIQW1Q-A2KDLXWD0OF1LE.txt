Title: Great Quality, Great Pictures, GREAT PRICE!
Content:
I am no professional, but I know what's good and I know what I like. And I just love this camera! I used a Canon Digital Rebel before, but this Nikon is much better. It's really well built, the pictures come out great and most of all.. of course the price is great. 
Don't be fooled by the higher megapixels other cameras have. 6 MP are in fast enough for really every kind of photography. With 6 MP you can print 20 x 30 inch pictures in top quality. So, why more?

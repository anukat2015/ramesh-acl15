Title: Fan is Noisy!
Content:
I've had this Lasko heater for 2+ years and it has worked like a charm... reliable, durable, a little soldier churning out heat.  Controls are easy to use and there is a fan only setting for hot days.  I keep it near me so the heat output is fine (not trying to heat up the entire room).
What I don't like about it though (and hence my 3 star rating) is the noise from the fan --- it's soooo loud; too loud to have in my office when I'm on the phone, and too loud in the room when the tv is on.  If you want white noise when you fall asleep, this is the fan for you.  But I'm looking for a new QUIET heater to replace this unit.

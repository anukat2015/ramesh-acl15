Title: Fantastic Toy
Content:
I bought this for my 14 year old son, at his request. He had several prior mp3 players, filling each one before advancing to the next. The ipod touch is his new ATF electronic device. He hasn't put it down since 12/25. He uses a wifi locator to find a signal so he can check his email regardless of where we happen to be. He plays games. And oh yes, he even listens to music.
Withing fifteen minutes of opening the package he was proficient with its use, it is that intuitively obvious.  I am very pleased with the purchase.

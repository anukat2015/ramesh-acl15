Title: A solid value!
Content:
I come from the world of manual film SLRs; this was my first digital SLR.  It's an excellent and solid camera, and simply can't be beat for the price.  It also allows for enough manual control that even seasoned SLR users will enjoy it.
WHAT I LOVE:
-The batteries last forever!  If you get rechargeable Sanyo Eneloops they will still last forever, but also be rechargeable.
-The photos are lovely and clear, especially in RAW.
-The interface is easy to understand; it's easy to change shutter speed and aperture quickly.
-It feels solid and tough; comes with great weather sealing.
-Works with all K Mount lenses, even old manual focusers.
WHAT I DON'T LOVE:
-Slow auto focusing.
-The kit lens is terrible.  Get a better lens and your photos will be 10 times better.
-Small viewfinder is difficult to focus.
-Limited number of autofocus points.
-Shots per second is very limited -- not great for action shots.
If you are wanting to dip your toes in the DSLR world, don't want to spend a fortune for a quality camera and plan on taking photos of things that don't move too much, this is an excellent bargain.
ALSO....I really recommend getting Photoshop to go with the camera.  The RAW images are eons better than the JPGs you will get out of the camera without advanced photo editing software.

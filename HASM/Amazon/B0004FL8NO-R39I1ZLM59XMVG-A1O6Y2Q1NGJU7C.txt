Title: Incomplete brew cycle
Content:
Shame on Black and Decker!  I'm now on my second TCM830 10-cup thermal coffeemaker.  First one I had would shut off part way through the brew cycle.  After reading the manual over and over I decided to call B&D.  They said I would have to package the maker up and send it to them to be repaired.  Decided that was too much hassle so I just purchased another one thinking the first one I bought was just a "bad egg".  To my disappointment the second one I bought worked well for a few months and started doing the same thing.  Will not buy another B&D small house appliance.  Maybe they need to stick to tools!

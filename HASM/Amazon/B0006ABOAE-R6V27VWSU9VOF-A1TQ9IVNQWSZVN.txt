Title: Not bad, but some issues keep it from being really good.
Content:
Well, first of all the price is great. The espresso maker works pretty well - easy to use and puts out very acceptable espresso with minimum of effort. The coffee maker portion makes decent coffee - we just use the Mr. Coffee paper filters, and I do notice more coffee grounds residue in the bottom of the pot then with other makers we have owned, but the flavor of the coffee is good if a bit bitter. One big issue is the pot leaks when pouring out cups - condensation builds up on the underside of the lid and runs all over the place when you go to pour. Only way to prevent this is to slightly raise the lid with your thumb when you go to pour, or just take the thing off. I like the convenience of the removable water reservoir - makes it easy to fill at the sink. Coffee making is a bit slow, and the swivel water sprayer inside the unit is a bit odd. I can imagine some day forgeting to swivel it back over the coffee filter after filling and having hot water run all over the place. 
The leaking pot is the only thing that would prevent me from recommending this to others. Otherwise, its a great value.

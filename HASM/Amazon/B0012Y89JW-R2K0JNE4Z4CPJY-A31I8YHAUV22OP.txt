Title: I really, really want to love this camera
Content:
I upgraded to the XSi from the original Canon Digital Rebel (300D).  I love everything about the XSi, except for one thing -- it can't take a sharp picture with my Canon 75-300 IS lens.  At first I was in denial.  Then I spent an afternoon taking pictures with the zoom lens on both the 300D and the XSi.  On the 300D, the pictures are as sharp as ever.  On the XSi, they are not.  It seems to have something to do with the depth of field--the shorter the depth of field (either because of aperture or focal length) the blurrier the picture.
So I sent it to Canon for repair, along with the 75-300 lens at their suggestion.  The XSi was under warranty, so no charge there, but the lens was not, which resulted in a $90 charge.
I just got the camera back; there is no indication as to what they did.  But there is no difference in the quality of photos with the 75-300 lens.
This is so sad.  I'm okay with getting a bad product every now and then, but if I send it in for repair to make it right--the manufacturer should make it right.  Now I have a crappy camera AND I'm out another $90 dollars.

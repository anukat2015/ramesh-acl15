Title: Great Coffeemaker!
Content:
For the last 10 years, I have been searching for the highest quality coffeemaker I could find, irregardless of price. During that time, I have been involved in two recalls and two units that simply ceased to function after a time. While this may suggest problems with my research methods, I think this time, I have found the answer. I have been using the unit daily for 3 months. The controls are easy to use, the coffee is great, and the finish does not show watermarks like the stainless steel I am used to. In addition, the inside of the carafe is not showing staining, a big improvement over previous units I have had.
I do not let coffee sit long, but I am a great believer in a unit that does not apply heat after the coffee is brewed. There is a water filter included with the unit. However I use filtered water, so I just leave the filter plugged in but turned off the warning switch that tells me that it is time to replace.
While time may change my mind, at this point, while on the expensive side, this unit looks like the coffee maker I have beeen searching for.

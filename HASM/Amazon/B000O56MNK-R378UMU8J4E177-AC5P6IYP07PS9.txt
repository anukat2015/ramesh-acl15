Title: Nice Laptop
Content:
This is the 3rd time I buy a Compaq computer and there is no doubt that it is always a good deal for an affordable price. The only thing that I don't like is Windows Vista... Microsoft really messed it up this time. Even though I upgraded my RAM memory from 1GB to 2GB, windows vista is so slow that it seems like I were using an Intel Celeron with 256MB of RAM and runing ten programs at the same time just to open the MSN messenger. Conclusion, Vista doesn't worth it. The rest is just fine.

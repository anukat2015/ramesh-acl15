Title: One of the Best Entry Level Digital SLR
Content:
Been using this as my primary still camera for the last 2 years.  At that time, it was the best selling entry level digital SLR camera.  A sub-500$ with an 8 megapixel resolution.  Uses CF card.  It is an entry level camera but is considered quite an excellent performer in many levels.
It comes with a battery and a sleek compact charger.  It uses the well known Digic II image processor.  7-point AF.  
Pros:
- Very fast start-up time and shutter lag is almost negligeable 
- Image quality is close to the more expensive EOS 20D.  Color rendition and low-noise
- Lighter and smaller than its predecessor
- Can shoot RAW format
- Burst.  14 frames at 3 frames a second
- Impressive long battery life.
Cons:
- Cannot shoot using the LCD panel.  You always have to use the viewfinder.  LCD is for menu and playback only.
- Supplied lens is very basic.  No image stabilizer.  Slow.
- No movie capability

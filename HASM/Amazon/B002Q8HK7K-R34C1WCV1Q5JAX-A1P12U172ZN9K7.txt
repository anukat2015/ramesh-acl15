Title: ASUS LAPTOP
Content:
I ordered 2 ASUS UL80VT laptops, one for myself and one for a college family member.  I did a lot of research and decided for the money this was a good deal.   I did notice some problems with the built in mouse pad from some of the reviews so I also ordered a wireless mouse.  The built in pad is very difficult to use.  Even with the wireless mouse I am a touch typist with large hands, at times the computer will highlight a paragraph of exit a program I am using with no input from me, it appears the "Ice cool palm rest" are not designed for large hands and can cause problems.  Personally I would just prefer the built in pad be completely deactivated, or maybe I will get a wireless keyboard although that is just more junk to take on a plane. It is a shame that this one item makes my laptop much less enjoyable to use.

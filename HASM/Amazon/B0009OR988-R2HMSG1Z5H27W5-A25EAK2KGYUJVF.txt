Title: Outstanding Vac!
Content:
This is a great value as a canister vac, esp. if you do not need a power head.  Do not be fooled if you read the reviews on Consumber Reports, which does not rank this vacuum highly.  They are flat wrong.  The vac is high quality, rugged, and very simple--and with GREAT suction (what else really counts?).  
Also, do NOT fall for the Amazon tag of Purchase the Vacuume plus replacement bags (for MDV2-3).   The are the incorrect bags; replacements can be purchased directly from Metropolitan.

Title: One big mess
Content:
My husband and I received this coffee maker a little over a week ago.  Tried it 4 times.  Of the 4 times we used it, it leaked all over the counter and floor twice.  A hot mess to clean up.  Disaster of a coffee maker. Never seen anything like it, and we've made alot of coffee in our lives, it's not like we're new to making coffee.  The travel mugs aren't bad but a bit of a steep price to pay for two travel mugs. Will try to find another brand with a better design. Shocked at how bad this Cuisinart performed.  They usually do a much better job than this.  I would keep shopping and locate another model.  Unless you like hot coffee squirted all over your kitchen first thing in the morning!

Title: Everything a New Parent Could Want
Content:
We love this camera. Although not full fledged "photographers", the camera makes it simple for the Point-and-Shoot fans. With the birth of our first child we wanted to be able to take consecutive shots without missing a smile, grin or sneeze. With the quick startup time and 3 frames a second we don't miss a thing now.
We compared against the Nikon D40 model and decided to go with the extra megapixels...just in case. The lens gives a comfortable zoom level to easily take shots from across the room. Granted when he gets mobile and out on a sports field we may look at adding a longer Zoom, but the Vibration Reduction Lens that comes standard is more then enough for now. 
Red-Eye was an issue with our previous camera and even though the D60 has retouching options built in to fix pictures, we have not used them as the camera compensates the flash and we have yet to see a picture with red-eye yet.
Battery life is great. We are still running off the original charge for almost a month and approx 500 pictures.
As for Cons - We really do not see anything specific. There has been an occassion where there was a delay after taking multiple shots in quick succession that the camera hesitated as it wrote data. We combined this purchase with a SanDisk Extreme IV memory card for the fastest write speed we could get. We have not located and specs on memory buffers in any of the cameras we looked at, but the more technical folks may know what to look for. (Please note this is a very minor issue stated only to offer input to future buyers).
The Free Shipping option was quick and the product arrived safely. We would recommend this product and are extremely satisfied with it.

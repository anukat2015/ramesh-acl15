Title: Not So Hot...
Content:
The heater is good if you stay within 3' of the unit. After 4 hours, it did not heat a 10x12 room at all. It was 68 degrees before and 4 hours later it was 68.3. There is no blower, so don't let the fan-like style fool you. Also, I was amazed how much light is produced. Forget about this in a bedroom, it is like you are looking into the Sun on Miami beach. Perhaps in a very small environment like an office cube it would be ok, but the light would drive me crazy.

Title: This is one of the best Enter level DSLR camera!
Content:
I love this camera, this is an excellent camera for outdoor portrait, pictures are awesome, it's a little heavy for small hands.  If you take pictures above ISO400, you will get alot of noise with this camera.  Well, I'm very please with this camera so far, I have it for over a month now.

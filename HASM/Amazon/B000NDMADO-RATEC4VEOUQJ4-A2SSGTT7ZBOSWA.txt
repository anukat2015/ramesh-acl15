Title: Powerful but somewhat awkward
Content:
I have owned product now for about two month.  The pros are the suction is powerful and it picks up great on carpets.  Also it is very easy to empty out garbage from cannister.  The negatives are it is hard to maneuver around.  You want to go in a certain direction and the cannister needs some adjustment on your part physically to make it go in the same direction you are pulling it to.  Also the hose attachment is too thick to get in some hard to reach areas.

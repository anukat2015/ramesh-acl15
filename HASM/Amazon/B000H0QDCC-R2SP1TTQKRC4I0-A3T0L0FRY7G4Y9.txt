Title: Great and more Great
Content:
First let me say that the menu system on the Zune is far. I mean FAR superior to any other MP3 Player (i-pod included). Only 4 stars because a click wheel would make the 30 GB Zune hands down the best device out there. Screen is bright and huge. Great battery life. The Zune software is awesome. The only cons I have are: No click wheel, The player itself is too big, video takes a long time to upload and not a lot of accessories. A great player for the price but, If you want to spend a little more the 80GB Zune is the best player out there.

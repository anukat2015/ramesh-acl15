Title: Big Heat for Small Price
Content:
I just got this to replace my heater that just died.  This morning a number of things struck me: 
1) This model diffuses heat in a more upward direction, rather than just straight across the floor
2) I found myself switching from high to low in a relatively short period of time
3) I ended up turning this off quite a bit sooner than I would have my previous heater
4) this model is feather-light
5) on low the noise is practically neglible
To be fair to economically priced heaters, I don't think the thermostats are generally all that accurate.  It is all relative; the highest settings will be the hottest, which is the important thing anyway.  Also, it is key to me that the thermostat ensures that the heater will turn on and off as I am sleeping through the night.  The exact temperature is hardly the point for me.
This heater has a lot of advantages.  From what I saw this morning I do not expect that I will need to run it as long as I did my previous heater to take off the morning chill and to provide me with a comfortable bathroom.  Therefore I have paid a bargain price and I expect that my electric bill will actually drop in comparison to when I used my previous model.  By the way, my previous model cost about twice this amount.
Thank you Holmes, for a dandy heater at a fantastic price.

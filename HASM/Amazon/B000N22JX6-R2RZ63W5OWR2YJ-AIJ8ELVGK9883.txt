Title: Awesome Little Heater
Content:
I am very VERY pleased with this purchase! Big thanks to the woman who actually suggested this product in a review I was reading about another I was going to purchase. A little unit that seriously kicks out the heat. I use it for an open area den-there is a draft from main home entry on cold nights. I sit it between door and lounging area. No more cold air is felt across the floor and even warms up the den area.  Had thought the remote was an unnecessary perk -- not anymore! Extremely pleased with this unit.

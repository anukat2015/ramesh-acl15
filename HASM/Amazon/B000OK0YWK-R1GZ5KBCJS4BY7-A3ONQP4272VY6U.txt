Title: Waste of Money-Don't Buy-Doesn't last 1.5 years
Content:
My husband and I purchased the Zune 30GB digital media player almost two years ago. His Zune crashed and died on him a few months ago and mine died yesterday. We experienced very strange technical difficulties 6 month into having this brand new Zune in our possession. I am so disappointed in this product being that we spent $300 each and now they both don't work!!!! My husband purchased an extended warranty on his and Microsoft is doing little to nothing to replace these defective, poor imitation of an I Pod device. I am soooo disappointed in Microsoft!!! Microsoft should stand by the quality and integrity of their products. We are like the only ones left in our family that prefer PC products-- although our family has been telling us for years that MACs are more technically superior and more reliable -now who has egg on their face? I have family members that have had I Pods for almost five years and they have never had problems with their MP3 player. We should've have gotten an I Pod instead. I would NOT buy this product because you would be throwing your money out the window!!!!

Title: Great little heater
Content:
I got this heater to use in my home office. I close the door and, even on low setting, it stays nice and toasty. It saves a ton of energy because I can turn the thermostat way down on the rest of the house during the day. This radiator is not designed to heat fast and it doesn't. But it does provide silent, gentle radiant heat that doesn't dry out the air. I just set the timer to come on about an hour before I start work. Seems pretty safe too, as the cat enjoys lying practically against it. The little red tabs on the timer feel fragile and are a little hard to adjust, but I don't change the settings much so it's not a big deal. I've found that running the ceiling fan on low reverse keeps the warm air circulating well. I'm starting the second winter with this heater and think it is a great purchase.

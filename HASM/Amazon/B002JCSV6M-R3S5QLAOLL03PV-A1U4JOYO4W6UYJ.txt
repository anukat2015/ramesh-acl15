Title: Great camera!
Content:
I use my cameras well, and hard, for many types of publications. This camera opens up whole new worlds for me in low light photography, and really extends my capabilities in new ways. It has typically superb Nikon ergonomics; although with lots more features, there's a bit of a learning curve with more comprehensive menus (for those control settings you can't access directly with buttons on camera). That's not a criticism, just a statement.
Highly recommended.

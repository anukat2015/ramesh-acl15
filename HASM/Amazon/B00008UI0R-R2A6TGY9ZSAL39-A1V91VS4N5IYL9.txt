Title: Great Little Machine
Content:
This little vacuum has plenty of power and does a great job on just about everything. I especially like the telescoping wand/hose. The vacuum came with enough attachments to do what I need. The best feature is the fact that you can control the on/off button from the wand so that no matter which attachment you are using you don't have to reach the actual canister to control the power. You can also control the suction amount which is great for small area rugs. The dirt cup is easy to empty and the filter can be washed. The only fault I can find with this unit is that it tips over sometimes when you are pulling it.

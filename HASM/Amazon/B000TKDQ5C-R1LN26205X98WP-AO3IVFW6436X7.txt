Title: Cheap but efficient........
Content:
Great for rooms no larger than 300 sq. ft. unless you plan to have it within 5 feet of you. I like them so much I have three of them in my house. These last three months have been really cold so we've used them quite frequently and I really haven't seen a spike in my electric bill which is a plus. 
Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a bit noisy but not enough to keep me awake.

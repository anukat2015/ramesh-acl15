Title: Exceptional Camera
Content:
The 5d Mark II is a very sturdy pro camera.  The original 5d was the camera of choice for many full-time National Geographic photographers because of its outstanding image quality coupled with a small portable body.  For the Mark II, Canon has added weather sealing, a host of dust reduction features, an expanded ISO range, and increased resolution (no small feat), along with a handful of other features.  ISO 5000 on the Mark II is comparable to ISO 1600 on the original 5d, in my opinion.  This camera is a workhorse for anyone who needs pro camera features coupled with portability.  Ideal for hikers or the traveling photographer.  Black dot issue?  100% fixed with a recent firmware update from Canon.  This camera is, for me,  more intuitive to use than the D700 and the pro features are worth the extra money over the EOS 50d.  An 8gb flashcard will hold about 250 RAW photos.

Title: Maybe I did something wrong, but...
Content:
Everyone else seems happy with this thing, but I have been very dissappointed.  No matter how I scour and wash the inside of this urn, I am always left with a gritty, oily deposit on the bottom.  When I refill the urn with water and heat it (I use it only for hot water, not coffee), I get an oily film on the water.  It is unuseable and I will have to replace it.  For what it's worth, I do not get these deposits or oily surface on the same tap water when boiled in a regular kettle.  Avoid this product!

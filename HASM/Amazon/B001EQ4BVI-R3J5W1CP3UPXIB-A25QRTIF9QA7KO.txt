Title: Great step up from Digital Rebel Series
Content:
Upgraded from Digital rebel XTi primarily for functionality (heavily invested in Canon lenses, so Nikon wasn't an option)... I am the person who doesn't usually care for "fancy" features, but the first thing that you notice is the difference in the LCD display. Makes it very easy to review pictures ... I usually shoot my indoor shots without flash, I like the warm feel of pictures it produces, but often causes the pictures to be blurry. Often you can't see that the picture is blurry until it has been downloaded to the computer and then it is too late to rewind time and fix it. So LOVE the detail this LCD shows and the excellent contrast it offers. 
The wheel makes browsing through pictures a lot easier. The joystick based menu makes it easy to customize your settings. The LCD display on top gives you a quick glance at all the settings without having to look inside the viewfinder (also great for checking/showing a newbie what settings you are using and why). The C1 and C2 settings can be used to remember your favorite custom settings for tricky conditions and can be a real time saver.
The Higher ISO settings (3200,6400) can come in pretty handy for taking pictures in low light without a flash, despite the noise - I prefer using the noise reduction features with the high ISO despite of the loss of detail that comes with it. Excellent camera!

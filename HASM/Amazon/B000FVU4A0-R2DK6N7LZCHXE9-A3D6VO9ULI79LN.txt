Title: Looks Good
Content:
Product is good-looking and works well.  I like strong coffee and use the "Flavor" setting for slower brewing.  The normal setting can be a bit quick and brews coffee on the weak side.  Coffee is hot.  Tends to leak a bit of water, though less than my former coffee-maker, and the automatic shut-off when you remove the pot is a bit slow to "kick in," so I cannot quite give it five stars, but a good product.

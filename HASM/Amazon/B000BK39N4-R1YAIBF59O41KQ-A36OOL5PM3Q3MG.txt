Title: Fulfils expectations, but watch out for delivery times ..
Content:
The product is satisfactory - you would not expect any less from Olympus. The shipping and the associated wait? That is another story! I chose free shipping (kick, kick!) and thought the the product would reach me in 5 to 9 days. No - it would "SHIP" in 5 to 9 days from wherever it is. So, for the next 9 BUSINESS DAYS, I watched my order - the product sat in a warehouse. I was tempted to cancel and get it via overnight shipping a couple times - or try the Prime Shipping as a one-off thing - but that would not be fair, right? Painstakingly, the product moved and came tantalizingly close - about 15 miles from where I live - and sat in a UPS warehouse for 2 more days. The last time UPS was supposed to deliver, it had just noted "Premises closed" - when I was at home waiting for the package all through the 8 hour window - and at around 2 PM the day of the delivery, I started getting the feeling that UPS would find a lock dangling at my place. Ultimately, it did not turn out to be the case. Overall, it took more than 12 days to travel 100 miles or so.
To rub it in, the battery took HOURS and HOURS to charge - it takes from 8 to 10 hours to charge fully. So, if you are in a hurry, do not order free shipping and add 10 hours to the UPS window to estimate the time you would first use the camera.
Results of the camera - excellent. I prefer to use the xD card in order to avoid the bulk and number of pins (that can go out of alignment - see another post in this trail) of a CF card. The xD card, in my experience, has been extremely stable and have used one for 3+ years. Also, if you have RM-1 from an older Oly, you can use that remote here as well!
The reason I deducted 1 star .. my patience ran thin with the S&H process.

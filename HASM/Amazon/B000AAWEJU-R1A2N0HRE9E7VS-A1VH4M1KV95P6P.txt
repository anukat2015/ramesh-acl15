Title: Not for carpet
Content:
I bought this because of all the excellent reviews and was very disappointed.  I am sending it back.  I had an electrolux canister vac that had a power head and assumed this was the same type of thing.  It's not.  It does not have a power head and it's very difficult to push and pull across carpet. Plus it's a small head which requires more work to cover the same area.  I'm sure it's okay for hard floors but do not get it for carpet floors because you will be sorely disappointed.

Title: Great Vacuum Cleaner!!
Content:
I wasn't sure about this vacuum when I got it out of the box until I tried it.  It has plenty of suction and does a great job on both hard floors and carpetted floors.  I decided to do an experiment with my Dyson and this one.  I vacuumed a section of the floor with the Dyson then went over it with the canister.  I was surprised to see the amount of dirt the Dyson left behind.  I reversed the experiment by using the canister first and then the Dyson.  The canister picked up a lot of dirt and the Dyson had virtually nothing.  
The only things I don't like are the short electical cord and the capacity of the dirt cup.  I have to empty it every time I vacuum and wash it out every other week.  Overall, for the performance it is worth the extra work though.

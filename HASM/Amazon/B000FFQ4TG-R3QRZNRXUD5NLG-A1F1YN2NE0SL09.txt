Title: My second Bunn
Content:
Although the Bunn may use a little more coffee grounds, the quick, hot, flavorful coffee is worth the extra money.  Actually, my coffeemaker, in error, came without the sprayer for the grounds.  So I used a 3 oz. paper cup filled with grounds and set it in the center of a coffee filter in the basket, directly under the hot water spout, until the sprayer arrived from Bunn.  I actually could cut my grounds back by one scoop with this method!  The sprayer (a couple of them) arrived within five days from Bunn.

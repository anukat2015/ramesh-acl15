Title: Thorough cleaning but somewhat inconvenient
Content:
The Bissell Flip-it does a thorough job, even after using the dry-vacuum I was surprised at the amount of dirt and pet hair that the wet-vac captured.  It is somewhat difficult to get into corners with the bulky head and though the squeegy action of the wet vac is great, it really gives your arms and upper body a workout.   I would not recommend this for older people or those with back problems.  The removable pad is easy to wash and probably more environmentally friendly than using the various manual stick mops with disposable sheets.  Disassembly for cleaning is easy, though somewhat laborious as it needs be done after every use.  Overall, a good product.

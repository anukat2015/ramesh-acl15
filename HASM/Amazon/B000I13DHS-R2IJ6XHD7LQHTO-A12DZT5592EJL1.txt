Title: no warm enough ....
Content:
We chose this model because it seemed an energy-efficient alternative to our previous Holmes spaceheater, which had worn out after several years of use. The one really good aspect of this heater is that it seems very safe -- the moment it is tilted or put against a surface, it stops.  However, it does not generate a lot of heat, even on the higher setting.  We have a very small bathroom, yet even after running the heater for 30+ minutes, the room is still not what I would consider really warm (admittedly, I'm a person who is easily chilled.)  We bought this in November and used it daily, but I was never completely happy with it, and now the heating element is starting to give out and the heater is generating even less warmth.  We're definitely shopping around for something with a little more heating power.

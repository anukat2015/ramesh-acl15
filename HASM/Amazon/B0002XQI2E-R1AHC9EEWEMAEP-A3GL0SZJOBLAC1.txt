Title: Well worth purchasing
Content:
I was skeptical after switching from from film, medium format, which I have been using for close to a decade. It took a few weeks of playing to figure out how to get the best out of this great digital camera. I didn't get the standard zoom that is offered in the kit, but got the Canon 85, 1.8f USM lens instead. Old habits die hard. If you do a lot of available light shooting for portraiture, this lens can't be beat. 
Anyway, once I figured the camera out, I was satisfied with the results. Shooting raw images and using the Photoshop raw plugin yielded the best results. 
I don't mind being labled as  a Luddite for saying this, but as great as this camera is, it still can't do better quality images than the "old school" medium format camera that I still own.

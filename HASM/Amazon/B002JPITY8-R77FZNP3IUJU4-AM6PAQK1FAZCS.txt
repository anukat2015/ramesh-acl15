Title: Nice player but the software is rubbish
Content:
The player is good, except that the touchscreen is extremely sensitive and you more often that not get a different screen from the one you thought you were checking. But what is really, really, bad is the Zune software you are trapped with. Believe me, it is archaic. To set up playlists from ripped CD's is cumbersome enough, but synching playslists to the player does not work more than 50% of the time. Sometimes only part of the playlist is synched, sometimes none of it, sometimes all of it - totally random. Sometimes the albums do not show on the playlist in the player, although they do in the software, sometimes they are not in the playlist but have been loaded as albums, the list of problems goes on and on. This is a maddening, frustrating, really terribly poor piece of software and I strongly recommend you think twice before you let yourself into this trap. I have searched the forums for advice and to check others' experiences - none of it is good. Buy at your own risk I say.

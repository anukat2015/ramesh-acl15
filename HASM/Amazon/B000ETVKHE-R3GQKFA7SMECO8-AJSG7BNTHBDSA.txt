Title: sansa e260
Content:
overall, i like this mp3 player.  the negatives are that it is a bit heavier that the ipod and the sandisk tech support for this is really bad.
the first one of these i bought through amazon had a bad display, it would not always go on when i pressed the power on.  it then would freeze up and i had to turn it off then back on.  sandisk tech support, 3 calls told me it was a corrupt song file and the last idiot told me to re-format
then reload all my songs.  he then proceeded to tell me i would have to do this once a month!  i told him i owned and ipod and never had to do that with it and did he know they are competing with ipod.  anyway, amazon saved the day.  i shipped back the bad unit and it was replaced in 2 days by amazon, even before they received the old one!  the replacement
is great, no problems so far with it.
i like the recorder and fm radio too!  overall, it's a very nice mp3 player, just stay away from sandisk tech support!

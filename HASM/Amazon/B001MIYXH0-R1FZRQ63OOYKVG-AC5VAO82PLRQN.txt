Title: very convenient, works well and lasts long
Content:
I purchased this from a certain big box hardware store on my way home from work.  I had a nasty cold or flu and was out of it.  I thought I was buying a heater that was $20 less.  When I got home, set it up (easy) and ran it, it warmed up the room nearly immediately and kept me warm for the next few days.  At that point I was happy I picked up a better heater, even if accidentally. 
Having a remote control, digital thermostat and timer were a big help, as was the oscillating feature to distribute the heat.  The taller design meant it kept my feet plenty warm in bed.  Why heat the floor? 
Anyway, two years or so later, it's still working as well as the day I bought it.  It's not as quiet as I would like, but that goes with the territory of ceramic heaters, and not enough for me to deduct a star.

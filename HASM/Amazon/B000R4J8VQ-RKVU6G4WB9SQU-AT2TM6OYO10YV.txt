Title: Perfect for coffee and tea!
Content:
Love it!!! Both my husband and I are tea drinkers, however I like coffee on occasion. Makes a perfect cup of tea in our travel mugs. It's hot enough to be good, but cool enough to enjoy. Also works with senseo pods. I wanted a pod coffee pot, but really didn't want to pay the $100. Was going to break down on the $64 model, but found this randomly on clearance at Target for $13 (MSRP is $30) Found this review while looking for a second (in case of breakage-we can't live without) and another filter. Filter is a bit grimy after 2 weeks of bagged tea, so will probably need replacing at some point. Coffee without pods didn't taste bad, but was messy to clean up. Wonderful wonderful machine. Won't pay over $30 for it, but it's perfect if you are looking for a pod machine.

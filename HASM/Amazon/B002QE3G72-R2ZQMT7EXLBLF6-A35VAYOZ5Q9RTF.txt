Title: Fast, lightweight, but unreliable
Content:
I purchased this machine on 12/8/2009.  The next day the cursor just froze in place, and only a forced power down got the machine to shut off.  This problem persisted and Sony replaced the unit one month later.  Now the same thing is happening to the replacement unit.  This time it seems to coincide with plugging the unit back in after working on battery power for a while.  This problem is widely documented on "forum dot notebook review dot com" by other unhappy owners.  Sony's outsourced offshore support is terrible.  Sony should take this problem seriously and stop selling these units until they have a fix. Sony Style store gave me a full refund on 2/19/2010.  Too bad they cannot support their products.

Title: THE NEW IPOD IS GREAT!
Content:
This is my first ipod.
I always have had a regular 1 giga mp3 player and I was ok with it.
But three weeks ago, a friend of mine turned up with the new ipod classic (6º generation) and told it was 80 giga for just 240 euros. And I thought "That's interesting". Then he show me the new cover flow interface...which is stunning...at that moment i knew I was also gonna get one.
Now that I have i just can say that "absolutely love it". Its huge capacity allow me to put all my music library in it and browse through the albums easily with the mentioned beautifully crafted cover flow mode.
I think the design is also great. I have the black one and looks great. I don't get any of the complains on the reviews. The wheel works perfectly smooth on mine. And now this ipod is so much thinner, just in case you didn't notice!
If you already have an ipod video, you probably won't need to upgrade to this version. But if you don't have and Ipod, go get it right now!!! It's well worth the money!!!

Title: Great little MP3 Player
Content:
This was a gift for a friend, an NPR and books on tape addict.  He just loves it!  It's his first player and he took to it quickly.  I transfer books on cd to it easily.  He records a ton of NPR pieces off the radio.  I've transferred a bunch of my favorite Alt Rock music to it from my library on my computer.  He also likes the voice recording function.  He's ADD and forgets stuff a lot.  He records notes to himself.  I imagine there'll be fewer yellow stickies all over his dash.  HA!  Especially for the money, this tiny little thing is a powerhouse.  I highly recommend it.

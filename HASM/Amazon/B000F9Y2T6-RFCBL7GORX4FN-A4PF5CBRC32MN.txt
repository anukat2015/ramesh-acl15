Title: Works great-Love it!
Content:
My husband and I shared doing the floors initially to see what we both thought. We thought the floors looked better, but after drying completely, we were surprised how much cleaner they were.  Then........ we emptied the cup and could not believe how dirty the water was. Our ceramic tile has small crevices that as the dirt accumulated, I went around with a Q-Tip and ammonia to remove. Now that I am 70 years old, the knees aren't up to doing this anymore and I was looking for something that would do the job and I sure found it! A little heavy, but not too bad.
I would highly recommend.Bissell 7340 Flip-It Select Hard Floor Cleaner with Heat

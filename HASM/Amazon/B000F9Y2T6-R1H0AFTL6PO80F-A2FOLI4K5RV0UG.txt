Title: Cleans well, but smells terrible
Content:
I like the fact that I can vacuum up any mess.  And it cleans the floor pretty well.  However, you must never leave it setting after you clean your floors.  It will smell to high heaven the next morning.  Even if you do clean it after every use, I still find that the unit itself just smells bad.  Not ideal for spot cleaning.  I'm getting a swiffer for little messes.

Title: I've fallen in love.
Content:
I have fallen in love with the Olympus E-420 and the two prime lenses, the 25mm pancake and the 50mm f2.0. After many years of photography, going all the way back to the sixties, my nostalgia for certain elements of the old ways has been satisfied by this camera. The compact size, the light weight, the prime lenses, the high quality and the ability to shoot with the feeling that the camera and I are one -- all are quite wonderful.
   The pancake lens is so comfortable and convenient, I am quite willing to overcome its lack of perfection -- it's more than good enough. And the 50mm is for me the sharpest lens, with some of the most beautiful images that I have had in many yearsOlympus Evolt E420 10MP Digital SLR Camera with 25mm f/2.8 Pancake Zuiko Lens.
   And, peculiarly, I am thrilled that this camera focuses so dependably. I've used lots of Nikons and Canons. In recent years, I've suffered a lot from erratic focusing, mostly with the Canon DSLRs. The confidence I feel with the e-420 makes shooting a real pleasure.

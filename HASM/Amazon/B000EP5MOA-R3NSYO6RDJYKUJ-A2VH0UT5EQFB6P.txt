Title: Great Nano!
Content:
I loved my 1 gig nano so much that I bought a 2 gig silver nano for my husband.  It has plenty of memory to hold all the songs he wants on it and then some.  Nice small, sleek size, no hard drive to damage if it gets dropped, and is easy to operate.  That's why I choose the nano - no hard drive.  I jog a lot and wanted something to listen too that could handle getting jostled and treated roughly without breaking.  Bright, clear, colorful screen with tons of options - like datebook, pictures, etc...  The nano is perfect!  Good price too.  Easy to sync with the PC and download any songs you want, or load them from your personal CD collection.  You do need a computer if you want to use an iPod, and I suspect most people buying iPods have personal PC's.  Absolutely no complaints about this little gem of technology!

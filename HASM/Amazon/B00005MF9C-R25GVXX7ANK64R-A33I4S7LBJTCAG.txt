Title: Great while it worked...
Content:
Product worked great for 5 months, then mysteriously it quit one morning and never brewed again. Black & Decker offered to replace the unit for a nominal fee of $7.50 for shipping and handling, but I passed. $18 for coffee maker and now $7.50 for the replacement - I'll cut my losses and end up with a nice mug. 
Good product - lousy service from B&D.

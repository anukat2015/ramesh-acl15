Title: If you own pets..this vacuum is a MUST have!
Content:
My husband and I talked about buying a new vacuum for years. We needed something that would tackle all the pet hair without having to take out a loan just to buy a vacuum. I can't imagine having to spend $500 or more. So we did some research and were really impressed by all the positive reviews on the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser. The price was unbelievable too. What a deal! After buying one we were absolutely blown away! What an incredible vacuum! The carpets look new and the pet hair is GONE! We are totally 100% pleased with our purchase.

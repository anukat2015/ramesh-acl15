Title: if you don't own an iPod, who or what are you?
Content:
my second iPod.  Very clear color screen, huge storage capacity, I have 50 Gb of music, 2 movies, and still have about 100Gb left.  I've heard of people using this as a bootable external hard drive to be used in an emergency, or for using a Utilities program to be able to clean the directory and such that you can't do on your Mac when using the internal HD.  I wish I had known this fact before purchasing a separate HD for this purpose.  I do recommend buying some type of a protective cover for when you will eventually drop it.  A quality product.

Title: This Vacuum REALLY sucks!!
Content:
WOW!
Don't keep anything you don't want to lose close to this vacuum! LOL!!
It has the MOST POWERFUL suction I have ever seen in a vacuum of
this size.
It really does have tons of power and just "cleans up", as they say.
My spouse appreciates how light weight it is and that fact that it will
"tag along" rolling on the wheels.
The hose is sturdy and does not kink when being used.
The cord is 20 feet long and wraps underneath the vacuum.
The bag is super easy to remove and to replace.
It is louder than my upright vacuum but not unbearable by any means.
I have used it to clean the ceiling fan, vacuum around the dryer, and vacuum out both cars, and that was just today!!
It is refreshing to find a vacuum that really works, as advertised, and you can rely on to "get the job done".
I LOVE MINE!

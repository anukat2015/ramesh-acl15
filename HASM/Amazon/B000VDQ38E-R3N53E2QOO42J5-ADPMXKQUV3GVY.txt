Title: Yeah! It works!
Content:
I just received this vacuum this week and of course had to try it out.  I have a Pug with very spiky hair that constantly sticks to everything. My previous vacuum, a hoover upright did virtually nothing to alleviate the hair problem.  One round with this Bissell and there was no hair left on my carpet or sofa.  The only downfalls to the vacuum are that it is big and heavy, and the handle doesn't fold down to allow for easy storage.  But the accessory tools work well and are easily accessible and overall I am quite happy with this product - if you have unmanageable pet hair in you house - you should give it a try!

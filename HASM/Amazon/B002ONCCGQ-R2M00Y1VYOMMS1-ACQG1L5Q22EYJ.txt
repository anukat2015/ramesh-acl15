Title: This Laptop is prety good,  battery life-not so much
Content:
I bought this laptop on the basis that it would give 5-6 hours of battery life with reasonable use as advertised. I was sorely disappointed with this advertised aspect of the machine since at best I was only able to squeeze 1 1/2- 2 hours (could be less) out of a full charge. This is with wi-fi and bluetooth off, running  a few saved videos on my hard drive. The machine's other features, like its beautiful finish, outstanding performance, and overall portability remain true to the ad, but if you are looking for a machine to give you a couple hours well between recharging, look elsewhere. 
Also it does tend to get uncomfortably warm when the processor is being taxed. The left palm rest in particular.
Production values on the power button leave a lot to be desired. It feels loose and a bit too shaky like it could fall off easily. A reviewer on other site has noted this about the power button as well. If you buy the machine you would have to baby the power button because if it falls off, there is no other way to put the machine on.(ie no remote control powering up access that is standard with the larger pavilion entertainment pC's)
On the plus side, the screen is beautiful and the chicklet style keys are easy to type on. The overall style of the laptop turns heads everywhere, just don't depend on the battery lasting long.
Bottom line, its a beautiful zippy laptop and windows 7 is a plus. Just don't buy it for the battery life though.

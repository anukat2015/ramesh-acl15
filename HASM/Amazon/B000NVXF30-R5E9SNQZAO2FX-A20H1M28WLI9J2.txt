Title: Nice Camera!!!
Content:
I sold my Canon Rebel XT and bought this because I wanted a DSLR with dust shake-off, live view and image stabilization. The 510 was a perfect match and after reading many reviews decided to buy it. I am very pleased so far, it is easy to use and the pictures I have taken so far are excellent. This camera has a lot of neat features, the highlight and shadow alert feature is quite unique.
I am really a novice and have slowly been learning the settings. I found the small fine print in the manual hard to read with my 50 year old eyes. I bought the Magic Lantern manual and have found it easy to ready and follow.
A great camera, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for the right features as I was, and the two lens kit.  Other reviewers have noticed that the price fluctuates, I watched that carefully, sometimes checking the price twice a day and got it for $550! 
Footnote: Be careful where you buy, some forums here on Amazon have identified some sellers as offering low-ball prices, then they call you to pressure you into paying high prices for accessories, then saying your item is back-ordered when you don't buy.
I did not experience this but want to bring it to everyone's attention!

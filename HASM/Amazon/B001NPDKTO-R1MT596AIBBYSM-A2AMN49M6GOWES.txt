Title: Computer Quick Launch buttons wont work on 32 bit windows systems
Content:
I have been using this computer for about 1 year and below are my consideratiosn:
Pros: 
The PC has a very nice look, the extended keyboard makes your life easier(when you use the integrated numeric keys), it has 4 USB ports, 1 Ethernet, Wireless AGN and BT, firewire port, SD card Reader 5 in 1, 1 PCI expansion port, and in the internal it has a 500 GB HDD, 4 GB of RAM memory, up to 512 graphics card, integrated microphone and webcam.
Cons:
If you plan to work in low light conditions the blue lights are a problem and the ventilation system does not works great, your laptop will sound like a running car, I recommend a base ventilation extra.
When working with windows 32 bit systems, the quick launch buttons does not work, neither the HP Tone Control Utility for the treble bass, I asked HP Support and they told me that the QLB only works in 64 bit edittions.

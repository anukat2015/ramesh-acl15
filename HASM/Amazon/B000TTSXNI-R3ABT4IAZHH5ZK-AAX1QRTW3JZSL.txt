Title: Love love love it
Content:
I knew based on the reviews that I was going to love this product, despite that fact that I only wanted a small heater for a small room. I was sold on the remote control idea, because who wants to get up, really.
It's attractive and looks expensive, but most importantly, it gives great heat.
The other feature I was sold on was the fact that it oscillates.
It was definitely worth the extra $20 I spent for a new heater after my little one which was a firecracker gave out on me. I thought I could never replace it, but thankfully I was wrong.
The third feature for me was the relative quietness of the unit. This was an important one since I do hate noise.
I have a very noisy one in the other room- don't expect me to hear you when I'm on the phone- not to mention it's just more noisy than it is hot.
I look at it each day with a certain amount of disappointment. If I hadn't bought it online and so cheaply I would have returned it asap.
You can't go wrong guys, this is a great little (not really, but at least it's slender) unit.

Title: Great camera for the novice and experienced photog
Content:
I've had this XSi for about 2 weeks and I just keep getting better and better with it. I've learned, with some of the excellent tutorials out there, how to work this camera beyond point and shoot. I spend a lot of time in either TV or AV mode doing long lens shots and night time shots. I've posted a couple of pics I took today (12/26/08) of Hummelstown Pa. using the kit lens and the results were stunning. Just look near the end of the customer pics
I've been using the kit lens and borrowed my daughters Canon 70-300 USM IS lens and couldn't be more pleased.
I just ordered the Canon Speedlite 580EX II, Shoe Mount Flash - Basic Outfit with 4 NiMH Batteries, Charger, Flashpoint Flash Diffuser as well as the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras but this is probably overkill for me for the time being but in time I know I'll be glad I did as I plan to shoot loads of pics of very larger remote control scale model airplanes during precision competition so speed and focal length will be a priority for me.
I also just purchased a great tripod/monopod combo (Sunpak-PlatinumPlus 72" Tripod/Monopod)  from another site that easily holds this camera and my daughters 70-300 lens combo

Title: Makes a great cup of coffee and keeps it hot!
Content:
This is my first Zoji coffee maker.  I was so used to Sunbeam and Mr Coffee I thought I would pay double the price and get something that I could keep for a long time.  I am convinced that I made the right decision with this coffee maker.
It is very stylish and now matches my whole new kitchen with all stainless steel appliances, salt and pepper shakers, sugar bowl and creamer, microwave, toaster, etc...It all looks very nice.  
This coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee but what I really like about it is the termal carafe that keeps the coffee hot for 7-8 hours.  Clean-up and keeping it looking great is a breeze.
The only drawback to this coffee maker is the carafe has a cap that fits over the cover where the coffee drips into the carafe.  This top needs to be removed and set aside while the coffee is brewing and then you need to leave it off for maybe another hour so that the coffee can finish dripping into the pot.  If you put the cap on right after you think it is finished brewing the rest of the coffee in the filter will drip on the cap and then run down all over the carafe and the counter top and you will have a mess to clean up.
If they think of redesigning this coffee maker the only change I would make is to the cap that fits over the carafe.  Other than this small inconvenience it's a great product.
One last comment, there are many who have siad they had a real hard time finding the #4 paper filters for this coffee maker.  I bought the Melitta #4 coffee filters and it fits perfectly with no trimming required as some others have mentioned.

Title: Finally a good vacuum cleaner
Content:
What a relief, finally a good vacuum cleaner. I researched vacuum cleaners for 3 months, I searched a lot on line and read all possible reviews. We have carpets and two Maine coon cats, so a vacuum cleaner taking care of pet hair was a must. I was tired of my old heavy/noisy upright vacuum cleaner so I was convinced that I want a canister vacuum. If you look for a light, small, quiet and efficient vacuum cleaner Bosch is a good choice. Cats are not scared at all and they walk around while I am vacuuming. The brush has two modes - bare floors and carpeting. It takes care of the cat hair, spilled litter and dirt. You can also adjust the suction power. Only negative is that after each vacuuming I need to manually clean the brush by pulling out the trapped hairs.

Title: only laptop you will need
Content:
just got the laptop abut 2 weeks ago, ordered it on pre-order.  so far i am thoroughly enjoying the laptop.  fast, reliable, clear and very functional.  a bit heavy to be carried around as a laptop but it was a desktop replacement so i got what i asked for.  you will have to download the windvd for bluray on asus website to watch bluray movies.  i have tried playing a few games modern warfare 2 on max resolution and everything is running smooth as ice. i highly recommend the laptop.  added plus, get it from Amazon, their customer service is impeccable.  i ordered mine when it was priced at $1699 and when it was shipped i noticed the price had dropped to $1648.  called the cr and they were kind enough to credit the difference.  NICE!!!

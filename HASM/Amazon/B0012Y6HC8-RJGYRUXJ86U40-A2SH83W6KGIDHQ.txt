Title: Very nise prosumer SLR
Content:
I bought it for my wife, and she just loves it. This camera is fast, produces good colors, and has effective AF, little bit more effective than my Nikon D80. It also somewhat lighter than D80, which is important for my wife. I like the option to buy body only; I combined it with Tamron 18-270 mm VC lens, that covers the whole range we need, from wide-angle to telephoto. And you can find great variety of quality lenses for it from Canon, Tamron and Sigma. 
On the downside, it's missing the ability to switch the AF mode from auto to single shot to continuous with push of the button, we have to use menu to do it. I found this option very convenient in my D80.
In general, so far I like XSi.

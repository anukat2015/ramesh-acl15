Title: Except for the interface, a great device
Content:
No matter what awards it has won, I loath the interface on this thing.  It is so darn hard to use the up/down touch sensitive thing it drives me crazy, and just try to give it to someone to use without any instructions.  No one knows what to do, and even if you tell them, just watch them for a minute - they'll always put it down in frustration.  I also have some gripes about the menu system and controls in general - you can spend 5 minutes building a playlist, but just be very careful as you go.  If you accidentally hit the play button instead of menu/scroll/add to selected, then BINGO, you've just wiped out the whole playlist, and it simply plays what you were trying to add to the list.  
Another annoying example:  You can set bookmarks all you want, but it doesn't remember any of the things in your playlist at the time, so, for example, you build a temporary playlist with 20 songs, you get to #10 and say save as bookmark.  Next time you go to the bookmark, it will play song #10, and that's it.  You have no way of knowing what else was in that list.  The same goes for audiobooks, which is really annoying.
So now that I've complained, what's good about it?  Well, it does work, and has tons of features, including an FM radio and voice recorder.  Also, it works flawlessly with my Urge subscription music service, including showing all the album art, it shows beautiful video, and the sound quality is excellent with my Shure headphones.  Also, the battery life is excellent.
So overall, it's a great player marred by an absolutely terrible control system.
My  2 1/2 cents.

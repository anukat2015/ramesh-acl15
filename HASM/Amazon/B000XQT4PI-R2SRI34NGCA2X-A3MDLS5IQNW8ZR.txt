Title: Cute little thing
Content:
I have gone through a couple MP3 players. My husband bought me this little thing and so far I love it. Its really easy to navigate through the options, the delete song feature is nice to have, the display isn't huge, but easy enough to read, the back lighting can be adjusted and makes it easier to read. It also has really good sound! I connect it to the stereo in my car and it works great! I also like how light it is, it doesn't hang really heavy on you and if you clip it on your belt, you can't tell it's even there. The only potential negative I could foresee would be that because it's so light and small, it may be easy to misplace or if it's not clipped on you, that it could fall out of your pocket and you wouldn't notice as it weighs next to nothing. Otherwise, it's a very cute and clever device that is very reasonably priced.

Title: Excellent, but would get the 8gb version
Content:
This was an upgrade over my old dell mp3 player.
It is durable, easy to operate, and the sound qualtiy is good.
My biggest gripe is the memory. I was able to fill up 2gb much faster that I expected and I wish had purchased the 8gb nano. My other gripe is that you cant delete songs from memory or playlists using the ipod itself...only from the computer using the itunes program.
The best thing about this nano is the size. The 2nd generation nano is the perfect size to fit in a pants or shirt pocket or on an arm strap. It is very thin and very narrow. My wife just got a 3rd generation nano which has a larger screen, but is wider and feels thicker.  The full size ipod is just a little bigger than the new 3rd generation nano.
If I were in the market for an ipod that is easy to take everywhere (including to exercise with), I would buy an 8gb 2nd generation nano.

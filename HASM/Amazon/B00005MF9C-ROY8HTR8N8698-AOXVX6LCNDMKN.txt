Title: you get what you pay for
Content:
my first one of these broke right around the time frame when the warranty was about to run out. it actually sounded like my coffeepot was depressed because it would "sigh" and not pump all the water out of the reservoir. i called the company and got a new one. They wanted me to cut off 2 inches of the cord (including the plug) and send it to them before they would send a new one. so i re-wired the plug on first one and it works fine. and now the newer one is starting to "sigh", so i'm going to re-wire the second one and i'm sure it'll be fine.
other than that it does what it's supposed to.

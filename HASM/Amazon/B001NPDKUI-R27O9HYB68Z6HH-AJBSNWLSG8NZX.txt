Title: Dead within first week
Content:
The first few times I used this notebook, the startup took a looooong time and hung a few times.  Then, maybe the sixth or seventh time I turned it on, there was no response from the monitor ... dead screen.  I called the support line, and per their instructions removed the battery/wireless card/RAM/hard drive and reassembled everything ... still nothing.  Seemed like a nice laptop for the hour or so that it worked.  The support staff were friendly and helpful and I am now shipping the laptop to the service center for repairs.  Will definitely not purchase an HP computer again.

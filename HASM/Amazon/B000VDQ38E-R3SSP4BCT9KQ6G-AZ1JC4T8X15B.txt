Title: Awesome vacuum!
Content:
This vacuum really does pick up hair like no other vacuum I've ever owned. I will provide a before and after shot to speak for it's amazing quality, and when you see it, know this; I have two beagles, a pug and a tortoise shell cat. All three of them shed like crazy and this vacuum keeps me [mostly] sane! 
To address the issue with the dust getting everywhere when you dump the contents of the container.. I simply dump the contents inside an old grocery bag on the area rug and am very careful not to drop dust all over the inside/outside of the vacuum. If you routinely empty it, chances are good that it won't get all super nasty-dusty everywhere like some have complained about- which can be said about all bagless vacuums, really. "Eww, what if you get that stuff all over your area rug after you just vacuumed?" I simply put the container back in it's place, throw away the bag full of eww, and vacuum it back up before pulling the cord from the outlet, wind up the cord and stick it in the closet. It's genius, I tell you!
The filters are easy to clean and easy to find replacements for, and the bagless container itself (along with the other removable pieces) is (or are) easy to clean as well.
My in-laws have a dyson that they paid hundreds for, and I honest-to-God believe that this vacuum works much much better than their dyson. 
I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a vacuum that doesn't suck and sucking. (I'm so funny, I know.)

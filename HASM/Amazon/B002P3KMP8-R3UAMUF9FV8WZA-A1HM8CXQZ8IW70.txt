Title: Semi Professional Solution for Laptop needs
Content:
First of all let me mebtion about the good sides of the product : Battery performance and CPU performance. These two topics are well designed and served and works in a good manner. Most of the specs. are the same with the manual.
But, there are some problems and lack of operation when it comes to touch pad design, plastic cover around the product and the dust  visibilty problem.
It's been 3 weeks but I still did not satisfied with the touch pad performance. It is still not easy  to use, multi touch functions does not work well all the time. I am still considering carrying a small mouse with me.
The cover or the produt looks shinny until you touch and feel it. It is covered with cheap plastic.
If this cover is black then you have another problem with dust and fingerprints.

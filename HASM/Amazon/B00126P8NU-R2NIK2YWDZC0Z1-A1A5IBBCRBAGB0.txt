Title: WOW!
Content:
This camera far exceeds my expectations. The in-body IS (image stabilization) works like a charm, and i love the fact that i will not have to spend an arm and a leg for a lens kit. My next camera will definitely have this feature. The two lenses that came with this package are great starter lenses, 1 wide angle and 1 telephoto....what more do you need as an amateur photographer? The build quality is pretty good and i do not think it is heavy at all like i heard before purchasing. Thank you Sony!

Title: Not as advertised, but promptly rectified  by Amazon
Content:
I'm asking Amazon for an exchange as the notebook sent me was not as advertised. After receiving the Asus UL20a I went to install a second memory stick and discovered the installed memory stick that came with the computer was 1GB 400mz instead of the 2GB 800mz advertised. Called Asus support and they told me to contact Amazon. Apparently they thought that somehow the different memory stick sent than what was advertised was Amazon's responsibility.
The UL20a appears to be a great computer for the money and I would have given it at least 4 stars probably 5 stars if the advertised 2GB memory stick hadn't apparently vanished to be replaced by a 1 GB.
I would recommend this computer to anyone needing a light weight, compact, full function(except of course for no optical drive)notebook and would definitely buy it instead of a netbook.
I  changed my rating to 5 stars after the prompt actions taken by Amazon to rectify this problem. See my comment in the comments section for details.

Title: Delonghi portables x2
Content:
I purchased my first DeLonghi Oil-Filled Radiator in about October '09.  I bought it for my son's upstairs bedroom (it's the attic area of an older home so chilly in winter).  It worked great.  Heated an area about 300 SQ FT nicely.  He liked it so I decided to by a second for his rumpus room in the basement where there is no heat but he and his friends spend a lot of time playing video games etc.  I bought #2 in December '09.  It also heated a room of about 100 sq ft. very nicely.  But within the month it ceased to function. No explanation.  Just stopped working one day.   Very disappointing.  I did return to Amazon for replacement.  The replacement unit arrived/an exchanged was made in mid January '10.  So far so good.  Amazon was great about the exchange.  But it was a little disappointing that unit #2 only lasted a month.  Overall I would recommend this unit for small to medium sized rooms.

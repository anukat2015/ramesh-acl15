Title: Don't make them like they used to!
Content:
Lightweight canister and handle are great, but suction stinks! Carpet attachment is powerful, but not good for area rugs or scatter rugs because it draws them into the attachment and can break it and ruin the rugs! Suction is not good. Small brush constantly comes off the handle where it is stored and is very annoying. Floor attachment is long and the brush picks up the dog hair, but the suction hole is small and not powerful. 
Will not last long. Liked my Sears Progressive much better, but it broke after just 3 years! This won't last the 10-15 years my original Electrolux's lasted, that's for sure! Can't seem to get a decent, long-lasting vacuum cleaner for a decent price! And I have had a lot of them! Too much of a hassle to return this and I am sure I won't find one much better anyway.

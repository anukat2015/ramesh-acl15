Title: iPod 80 GB
Content:
Pros:
-Overall this device is very good. Compact design with 80 GB storage. This is plenty of storage to hold music, pictures and videos.
-Brushed Aluminum front cover is very appealing.
-It's easy to find wide range of product accessories that support this device.
-Works seamlessly with iTunes.
Cons:
-New design (material) to eliminate scratch on the back cover and rolling wheel pad. (Keep the mirror finished design)
-Bigger screen by reducing rolling wheel to minimal size.
-Keep the compact design and add radio for the next revision.
-Reformat iPod to have it work with other programs.

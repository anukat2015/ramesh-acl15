Title: Poor low light performance
Content:
Wanted to take a step up from my old Canon G3 and Canon SD800 which my wife and I were using was using as a point and shoot without getting a full size SLR.  The Lumix DMC-GF1 took stunning pictures on a tripod in either manual or auto mode, but holding the camera, 90% of the pictures came out blurry even in adequate light without the flash.  With the flash, the pictures are not much better then the G3 but the focus is much faster.  The pictures I have taken with a Canon Digital Rebel XTi have always been beautiful.  The promise of the micro four-thirds are great, but time to wait for the next generation.  So the GF1 is going back to be replaced with either a S90 or a Canon Digital Rebel XTi.

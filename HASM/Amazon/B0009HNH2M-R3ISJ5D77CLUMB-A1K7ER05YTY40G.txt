Title: I didn't think I liked canister vacuums
Content:
I bought one because we have both wood floors and carpeting. This machine does a great job on both. It's much more powerful than I imagined it would be. While the canister is heavy, you're really only dealing with the much lighter handle. Even the stairs are easier. I've had bagless versions, and frankly, I'd rather not deal with the mess. The bag acts as a filter, so you're changing the filter everytime you change the bag. I've heard that the canister style lasts longer. We have two long-haired fur balls at home, so we usually burn out a vacuum cleaner in a year. The upright models designed so that the mess doesn't go anywhere near the motor run about $500. The bags are available here and at about a hundred web sites on-line. Don't look for it at your grocers though.

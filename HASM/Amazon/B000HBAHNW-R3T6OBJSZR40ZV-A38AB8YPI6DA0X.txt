Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
I bought this vacuum after months of researching vacuum cleaners.  I vacuum constantly and needed something that could withstand the wear and tear of being used more than normal.  I have used many different vacuums in the past and none have lasted more than a year with out breaking or parts falling off with the exception of a Kenmore I bought 15 years ago that just finally quit, but many parts had fallen off including the wheels about 5 years ago (thus the new vacuum search).  I have a 4000 sq. ft. house with both carpets and hardwood floors, the Miele Callisto is the greatest vacuum I have ever used it is so quiet I had to bend over it to see if it was running.  It easily switches from hardwood to carpet with a push of a button it is light weight and follows you without much resistence.  It does have a short cord but it has not been a problem and it has more power than anyone will ever need, I have it set in the middle and has plenty of suction to pick up cat and dog hair and make the carpets look great!  It was well worth the money.

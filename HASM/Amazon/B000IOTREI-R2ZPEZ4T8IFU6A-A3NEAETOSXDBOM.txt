Title: Works great for heating
Content:
I own three of these units--one in my office and two for my porch at home. This works exactly as advertised--no noise, instant heat, and less electricity used than a conventional heater (so I no longer blow a fuse in the office when everyone has their heaters turned on).
I have a large porch with skylights, lots of windows, and three walls with outer exposure--it's really cold in the winter. Before I bought the heaters I used to rely on baseboard electric heating installed on the porch, but it usually took a while until the room was warm enough to use. However, with just two of these heaters, we can start watching TV in minutes, and also use less electricity.
Since the heaters don't come with an on/off switch, I keep them plugged into a power strip and just turn the power strip off when I want to turn the heaters off. For me that's more convenient than unplugging it from the outlet all of the time.
I have used many portable heaters over the years, and consider this unit the best solution for my needs. I bought mine at Costco, which has the lowest price.

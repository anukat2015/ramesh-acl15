Title: BEST space heater I have found for the money...and it is safe to leave on while away from home.
Content:
I've purchased many different types of space heaters in an effort to keep a drafty old house liveable. This one has the advantage of being safe to leave on while away from home...a big plus if you don't have central heat and your home takes hours to warm after being at work all day. It heats a large room with high ceilings comfortably. I recommend it highly!

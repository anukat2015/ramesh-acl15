Title: Great Coffeemaker if you like LUKEWARM coffee
Content:
Very disappointed..First bought the one with the grinder in it and took it back because it was a filthy mess to clean and extremely loud while grinding. Exchanged for this model and my $20 8yr old black and decker makes better coffee and IT IS HOT!!! My fault...should have done some reviews on here before purchasing..got burned for $75...never again

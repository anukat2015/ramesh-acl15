Title: My First DSLR: Awesome
Content:
After going through 3 generations of Canon compact digital cameras (s410 being the last and still working after 2.5 years), I am very glad to finally have made the investment in a digital SLR camera.  The quick startup time, the small shutter lag and flexibility of the XTi are fantastic.  I have taken several hundred photos so far under a variety of conditions and I am very pleased!  I still use my s410 when I don't feel like lugging around the XTi.

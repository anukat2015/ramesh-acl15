Title: Excellent Camera with a Tough, Durable Body
Content:
A few reviewers have purchased the Canon 20D rather than the Rebel XT (350D), because the Canon 20D's body is covered with a magnesium alloy and the Rebel XT's body is mainly plastic. However, one should not discount the Rebel's plastic body. It's made of polycarbonate. I did a little research on this material and found that it is virtually unbreakable and in laminated form is used to make "bullet-resistant glass." Of course, no matter how tough the body is, something else will break, such as the lens or the internal workings, if the camera is dropped on a hard surface. That's why I always place the camera's strap around my neck before handling it.
Although a couple of reviewers stated that the camera feels too light, I've found that it has plenty of heft with my 28-135mm lens.
The Rebel XT is an excellent camera. My only complaint is that I tend to smudge the LCD screen when I look through the camera's view finder.

Title: The best, until it broke
Content:
I am sad to write this review. I loved this vacuum, but unfortunately 2 days after the warranty expired, it would not turn on. We took it to the authorized repair center and when we walked in, they rolled their eyes. Seems that Electrolux is "in complete chaos" following the acquisition of Eureka. They told me to expect the vacuum to take months to repair because Electrolux is so screwed up they don't even know what parts go into this vacuum.
I paid full price for this vacuum and now the repair is going to be $100+ more. I am going to go ahead and repair it and try again, but my guess that the little vacuum I loved won't be around for much longer.

Title: Great easy to use heater
Content:
Have owned this heater for less than a year and wanted to wait before submitting a review. It is a simple design,reliable and easy to use. A great buy for the money. Be patient and don't expect instant heat; but once up to temperature regulates nicely. 
My only constructive criticism (in my opinion)is that the on/off switches for the two power levels require getting use to.
You move the switches down to turn them on and up to turn them off.You know when power is on when they light up.      Lucky Lou

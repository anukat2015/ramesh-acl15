Title: Luke Warm Coffee
Content:
I loved the design of the coffee maker. Not having to move the coffee maker to pour water is a great idea. However, it does not heat the coffee well. The coffee is luke warm. Great look, poor outcome. 
Another negative is the length of time it takes to brew 4 cups of coffee. Almost 20 minutes! 
Don't waste your money on this machine. Buy another and you will be happier.

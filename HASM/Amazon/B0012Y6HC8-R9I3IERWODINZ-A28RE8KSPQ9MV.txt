Title: Easy to use camera
Content:
I may be biased b/c this is my first DSLR camera, but I can't live without it. It is easy to use for the amateur like myself or advanced enough for a professional. very user friendly camera and is actually pretty easy to use. Fairly light camera even with big tamron 28-300mm VC lens on it (a must have). the pics have been perfect so far...if not outstanding

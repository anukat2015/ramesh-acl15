Title: Great camera-Great Price!
Content:
Like many others I was trying to decide between the Olympus and the comparable Canon model. Went to the stores and handled both. The Canon felt toyish, the Oly, just right. I have had this camera for about six weeks and love it! The pictures look great (full auto mode). The lenses are what clinched the deal for me. The two lens kit cant be beat.
I have been talking pictures in all the different modes the camera has to offer with no problems.
The camera is just the right size (I have big hands) and I don't find the viewfinder to be all that small, as noted in other reviews.
The start up time is fine also. The anti-dust feature takes about 1 sec, and is worth it. I also bought a Sandisk Extreme 3 2GB card for this camera. No problems to date. I download directly from the camera. Some reviews complain about transfer speeds, but I dont feel this is a problem.
I can downlaod about 100 pics in about 12- 15 mins. The write speeds are great. **NOTE** READ THE MANUAL. This camera is not a toy. If you read the manual cover to cover you shouldn't encounter any problems. If your looking for your first digital SLR, give this one serious consideration. Dont think I'll ever use my Minolta 35mm again! Why by film? and processing? E-Bay here I come

Title: Not worth it..
Content:
bought this device around 15th of march..
I'm a avid linux user, this device does not support
direct drive mounting.. inorder to mount the device
you have to put the device in "emergency mode"
same mode for upgrading the firmware..
Also when i loaded the files directly onto the device
i could only see 550 file in one directory. I believe
this is a firmware bug..
The customer support needs improvement. I bought 
a iriver car charger from iriver and not even 2 weeks
after purchase the device was smoking from the electrical
car adapter.. FRIED IT!..
I sent and e-mail to support (you have to open a mypal)
message account from iriver in order to recieve support..
Waited 1 week before i heard anything back.
They stated that the electrical problem is not covered.
So basically I ate $250 dollars.. What a rip off.
So in short.. DONT BUY THIS DEVICE.. GET A COWON X5 20/30/60GB
device..
About this device.. The headphones are cheap i bought a set
of ER4Ps love them.. And used the H10 as a car stereo/office
radio due to I work in a corporate workplace and cannot
stand the evesdropping. But the quailty of sound was
good from this device it beats using the built-in
sound card on my IBM T30..
Good Luck.

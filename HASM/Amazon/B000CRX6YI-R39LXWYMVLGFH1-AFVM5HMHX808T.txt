Title: Excellent Camera
Content:
I used a D70s before I switched to this. However, the D200 really takes you up a notch.  Excellent in-depth camera menus, easy access to WB, QUAL, & ISO, 5 fps, tough body, and a nice 10.2MP sensor to name a few.  All-around great camera. I use it with a Nikkor 80-200mm AF and an 18-75. I also use my Tamron 90mm macro (an excellent lens in my opinion) with this and it produces sharp and large portrait and landscape prints.  If you are even thinking of buying this camera, just do it.  It's definitely worth it.

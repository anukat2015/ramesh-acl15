Title: The Best vacuum I've ever had
Content:
I'm amazed at how much dirt this machine takes out of my rug! The controls on the handle are convenient. Love the retractible electrical cord. It has two powered bushes- one for the rug and one for the sofas and other fabrics.  I do not like  the floor brush that doesn't engage securely with wand and falls off pretty easily. The floor brush is just plastic without a metal fitting to attach the wand and the hose securely. I also don't like the fact that the power rug cleaner just flops when you lift it off the rug. Some reviewers complained that the wand would not stand up when not in use but it does if the wand is leaning forward. I will no longer have to buy new vacuums. A $176 vacuum made me perfectly happy.

Title: This computer is so solid.  Excellent Screen. Cool Touchpad.
Content:
I bought this MacBook to replace a white MacBook.   This computer is fairly similar in features and really is just what I want - not too big or too small.    I was worried about the screen after reading reviews that said it was too glossy and reflective.   The screen is excellent.   It is a step up from the last MacBook - which I thought was fine.  It is very bright.   For my purposes, the colors look sharp and vivid.
The new aluminum case is amazing - it is noticably a little lighter than the prior model.  I guess time will tell, but it seems so damn solid and stiff - it is built like a tank as far as I can tell.   The original model's plastic would bend and twist a little - none at all with this case.   It feels as solid as the iPhone.
The glass trackpad - takes a little to get used to - but it is another step in the right direction.   It has seemed to occasionally miss a click when I press down on it, though.   I like the different gestures - like using 3 to go back when browsing - it's cool how fast the brain adapts to make this second nature.
It seems to be fast for all my admittedly low to medium intensity computing.    
I used the ethernet Migration Assistant to move everything from my old macbook - it was seamless, but did seem to take a little longer than when I've done it with firewire in the past.   I personally will not miss the firewire port - my camcorder is USB - so good riddance to a useless port (for me).    
To sum it up - if you're looking for a laptop of this size - this is a great choice - cutting edge design, built like a tank.

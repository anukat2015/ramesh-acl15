Title: Not a bad compact unit, and it puts out decent heat.
Content:
Although this is not the most stylish unit available, This model does put out a decent amount of heat, and has safety features such as tip over power off that makes it safer than heaters of the past. It also a durable metal shell, so it does't ding up like some grill heaters do, or break like some plastic parts might on others.  I originally used this in my garage, but have found uses for it in my home as well as at the office.  Check it out, its usually about $20 at many major retailers, and hopefully amazon will eventually get some posted so you can get one delivered to you directly.

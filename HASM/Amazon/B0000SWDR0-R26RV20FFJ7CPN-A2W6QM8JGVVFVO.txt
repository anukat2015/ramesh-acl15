Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I decided to go with this Electrolux since my mother in Germany owns one since forever and loves it. This one is a new hip design which is unlike the usually very old fashioned and VERY expensive (more than double of what this one costs) Electroluxes I know from Europe. I liked the design much better and thought the price was great so I got it and was disappointed after only a few weeks when the belt ripped for the first time. The closest repair dealer had to order the part. I now own this vacuum for not one year and have been at the repair shop at least 5 times!!! The belt keeps ripping and I had the whole bottom part of the power brush replaced since something on it broke. Needless to say I am very disappointed and wish I had gone with the Dyson instead. The suction isn't that great either and in fact I feel it is worse than with my former very cheap $99 Hoover model. The one PRO I think is that it can vaccuum great under furniture, beds and so on, which uprights have trouble with. It is also not that heavy and easy to carry. The little power brush for the stairs and sofa's and such is great as well. BUT, overall not worth the money I think!!!

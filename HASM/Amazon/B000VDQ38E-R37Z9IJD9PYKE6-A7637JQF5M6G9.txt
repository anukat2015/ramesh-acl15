Title: Worked great....then did not last more than 4 months.
Content:
I would agree with every one of the positive reviews when I first bought the pet hair eraser. It was amazing and picked up everything. However in 4 quick months of light use the bristles stop spinning on the main unit when I was pushing the unit around. When the unit was upright the bristles would spin fine. I examined the hoses to look for any potential clogs and found none. What I did find was that after 4 quick months that the plastic bendy hose (pardon my technical speak) that connects the bristles to the main hose system and cracked when in the vacuuming position. I was able to find enough complaints that I was able to return the product with a full refund. Save your time and find another item or wait to write your review for a few months.

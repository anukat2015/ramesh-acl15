Title: DeLonghi DFH132 SafeHeat Fan Heater
Content:
I love this heater. It is very quiet. I love the thermostat; set it and it keeps the room at a very comfortable temperature. It is small enough to fit under my desk at work and not be in the way of foot space, yet keeping my feet comfortably warm. I would recommend this heater. The price was very reasonable.

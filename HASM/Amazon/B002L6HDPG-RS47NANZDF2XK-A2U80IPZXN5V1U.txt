Title: "Not That Different From The Previous Generation of Nanos"
Content:
The fifth generation of the Ipod Nanon has arrived, this time it brings the much talked about camera which can make videos and the mic allows sound. The camera works well and the videos look pretty good but it's just not placed in the best spot Other than the built-in camera the screen is noticeably bigger than it was with the 4rth generation of Nanos which is great. The pedometer is a nice new cool feature if you want to know how many steps you did in a day, not a must but if you walk to exercise this is could be useful. The new FM radio tuner is not for me as I don't like radio and rather like to listen to my own music but it is a cool feature. The way to organize music and playlists is even better now and the voice feature is neat, record memos so you don't forget something and it is used for other things as well.
Why only four stars? Well because it's not all that different from the previous nano, the camera is great but none of those features are really a must unless you want them. If you have the previous generation of the Nano like I had you might not feel the need to upgrade to this one. Unless you really want an Ipod that can take videos or you don't already have an Ipod I would probably not recommend it. The same thing goes if you just want a portable music player and don't really care about the other features. Was it worth for apple to release this new Nano? Of course it was as a lot of people will want an Ipod that can make videos so it seems reasonable to put his product out.

Title: Definitely worth it
Content:
I used the Bissell Flip-It Select for the first time tonight. I detest mopping, but with a combination of both linoleum and tile floors in my house, it is a must. So in looking for an alternative to mopping, I hoped for the best with this product. I was not disappointed. Vacuuming first with the dry vacuum side is an excellent alternative to sweeping the floor. After using the wet vacuum side with the heated solution/water mixture, not only was my bathroom linoleum (which had a thick build up of sticky hairspray) cleaned marvelously, but also my tile kitchen floor. The unit is lightweight and easy to use.  The filter did get clogged with dirt and hair, but the sound of the motor changed when the suction stopped, so I unplugged it and cleaned the dirty wet/dry container and filter, put it back together, plugged it in, and suction was completely restored. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase after only one use. I will recommend it to friends and family alike.

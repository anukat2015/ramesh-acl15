Title: Great product
Content:
The Cuisinart grind-and-brew has been great.  I don't have much to offer beyond what the other positive reviews had to say, but in general, my comments are these:
-very easy to use
-incredibly efficient thermal pot that doesn't require heating but stays hot for HOURS
-cleaning is a minor annoyance, but simply takes a couple of mintues
-pot/machine are very elegant looking and display nicely in the kitchen
-grinder is a bit loud, but that's to be expected
I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to purchase an item like this in the 100 price range.  It has been worth every penny.

Title: Very good vacuum, only some minor complaints
Content:
Well, I'm a housecleaner. I clean people's houses with this thing and can compare it to other vacuums; like the Dyson or Bissell. Here's what I have to say: It's a fabulous vacuum, gets up all that pet hair (ALMOST as good as the Dyson). And canister vacuums are always more flexible, less heavy, and less tedious than uprights, which is why I selected this kind of vacuum. All the buttons are within easy reach; different suction settings, turn carpet brush on/off, and so on....whereas unlike the Dyson, your buttons for carpet and floor are on the bottom of the vacuum, and you've got to bend down to switch 'em. Yes, that is far more tedious when you have to clean people's houses every day!!
My only complaint about this vacuum is how small the dirt container is; it's tiny! And because it sucks up so much dirt, I'm usually emptying it about 3 times average per house I clean. I still highly recommend this vacuum though any day over a $300.00 more Dyson.

Title: Don't buy this
Content:
I brought this product and it died after a week. Delonghi has the worlds worse customer service! They have this i don't care attitude and they would not replace it. I had to drive 45 mins to a service center and than they took a month to fix it! Got it back work for 3 weeks and broke again! I guess i have to wait another month to get it fixed. DOn't buy from this company they don't stand behind their products.

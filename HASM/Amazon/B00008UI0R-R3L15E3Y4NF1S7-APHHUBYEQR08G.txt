Title: Hoover S3765 vacuum sucks (that's good!)
Content:
This vacuum works very well. It has a good set of attachments, and is easy to handle. A couple of things I'm not so pleased about: 
1) It's very heavy. The metal wand (?) is quite sturdy I guess, but it makes using the vacuum a lot of exercise.
2) I thought a bagless vacuum would be a good thing, since I don't need to buy and change bags all the time. However, this one is rather inconvenient and complicated to empty. The canister has butterflying panels on the bottom, under which the dust and dirt get trapped. The panels can't be removed, which makes it a bit hard to get all the junk out and almost always requires sticking your hands in to scoop stuff out. Yuck. In addition, every time you empty the canister, you have to wash it out and rinse out the filters. I wish I had bought a vacuum with a bag.

Title: GREAT CAMERA FOR PRO'S OR AMATEURS
Content:
I waited a lot for this camera, and finally decided when the price dropped a bit. It is my first owned DSLR but I have had some before like the EOS REBEL, 20D, 30D, 40D and 5D. Compared side to side with the 5D they look and they behave similar.
I think it is more like the big pro cameras than the Rebels.
First of all, the size and weight. This camera is heavier and can be tricky for small hands.
I was invited to an event on the press area and took my place and found that some pro users and reporters use this same camera with an L Series lens. It behaves great! 
If you are planing on buying a DSLR I think the Rebel is good choice, but the 50D asures a longer life and a more resistant body and of course more shots due to the use of stronger materials.
I am not a pro but I can do pro jobs any time. 
The lens is a good lense compared to an L series lens. My budget was limited and I choose to invest in the body and a basic lens, then in the future I can work my way to a better lens. I found a little bit of a problem in low light conditions even at high ISO. The combination of high ISO and low light gives noisy images, but in daylight you do not have a problem. It is a fairly made lens, that I think will last several months in medium use. But I feel it can give you a headache unexpectedly if you have pro assignments. I had to choose between basic body with better lens (Rebel) or better boddy with basic lens (this one).
By this day the EOS 7D has seen the marketplace and priced a little bit higher. And it is a good time to get the hands on a 50D soon if you don't have one now.

Title: Excellent choice
Content:
I have always liked Krups coffee-makers, and this one is no exception. I gave it 5 stars because the coffee it makes is always great, I love the thermal carafe and the machine looks nice.
The thermal carafe is much better than the previous Krups carafe, which required you to untwist the top in order to pour a cup. This one just requires the press of a button. I have had a similar experience with getting out the last drop of coffee; it requires completely inverting the carafe. But this is just a factor of its compact design and thermal qualities. It has never really bothered me.
I had no trouble figuring out how to use the machine. There are four simple buttons, and they all work very easily. The only function of one button is to turn the single-cup feature, which brews the coffee slower for smaller amounts. And if you have no trouble setting your bedside alarm clock, you'll have no trouble setting the clock and timer on this machine.
I would agree that the hinge that is used to open the filter-area does stick sometimes, but it's never really a problem.
And finally, the coffee is great. I've tasted bad coffee and terrific coffee and everything in between. And this by far is great coffee.

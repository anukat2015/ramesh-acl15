Title: Very pleased with my Bunn
Content:
I have been using my Bunn NHB Professional for almost a year now and I am extremely pleased with the results.
I have noticed that some reviewers mention that one must use more coffee than directed on the package or it turns out too weak.  I have noticed this with some brands of coffee.  Recently however, I started using Starbucks coffee and it brews a perfect cup with exactly the amount of coffee specified on the package instructions.  This takes some of the guess work out of using this fabulous coffee maker!

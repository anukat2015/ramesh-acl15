Title: Awesome ipod
Content:
I got this nano to replace an old ipod mini that I had.  I think the features are awesome.  The space on it is really good.  I have about 1500 songs on it right now and still have 5 gb left.  I use the radio to listen to my favorite radio program at work.  I use this thing in the car, at work, at home, pretty much everywhere.  Sound quality is great.  I've only used the video camera a few times just for fun but it seems to be quality for such a small camera.  It's a great bonus.
Battery life is the only con because it doesn't last quite as long as it says so I do fully charge it every couple of days.  You will also definitely want to get a case of some kind for this nano because it appears fairly easy to break if you were to drop it on the ground.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants an mp3 player that can easily fit in your pocket.  Well worth the money.

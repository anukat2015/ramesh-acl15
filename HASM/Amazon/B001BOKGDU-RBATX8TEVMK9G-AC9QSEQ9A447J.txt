Title: Black & Decker 5-Cup Coffee Maker
Content:
Black & Decker 5-Cup Coffeemaker is an inexpensive & quick way to a delicious cup of coffee. The size of the pot is perfect for one person or two. So easy to use & easy clean up. Nice, clean lines. Great gift idea.
Note: when filling the water resovoir & pouring the coffee, it's best to use the thumb tab to lift the carafe lid, otherwise the liquid tends to over flow the spout.

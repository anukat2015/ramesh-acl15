Title: Gets the job done, but not perfect
Content:
Well I got my Zen micro in anticipation of a big backpacking trip I plan on taking later. In the meantime it has been my faithful companion on a two-weeks trip in China and on my various trips around my own country (on public transportation). I am overall very happy with it, but there are just a few things I would change:
--The on/off switch is awkward to reach when the headphones are plugged it
--The "idle shutdown" feature turns the micro off when I am in the middle of listening for a long time, and it's annoying to have to turn it back on (maybe this just reflects my own ignorance of how to use it)
--The ear buds that come with it are not comfy for my little ears, I bought some Sonys that fit better
--I wish it had more than 5 gigs, maybe 10 would be good for taking on a really long trip.
--A line out feature to hook it up to a stereo system or TV would be nice, connecting via the headphone jack doesn't give the best quality or volume
Other than those relatively small complaints, I love my Zen micro--especially how it's so small and yet holds so much music, and with good sound quality!
In short, unless you have a HUGE music collection you want to take with you, I would recommend the Zen to anyone.

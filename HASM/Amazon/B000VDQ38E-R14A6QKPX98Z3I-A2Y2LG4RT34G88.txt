Title: One small dog = one trash can of pet hair!!
Content:
This sweeper does all it says! We've had a dog throughout our 45 years of marriage.  I have tried MANY sweepers during that time.  None came close to this one for picking up pet hair.  Believe me, there is NO hair in the carpet when you're finished!  My carpet looks like new, and it's 13 years old.  For the downside:  it's a bit heavy going up and down the steps; you must empty the container before it is super full (I look at it the same as emptying my dryer filter after each load.), and there may be some dust when you empty the container.  I don't have allergies, so this is no problem.  My husband was very skeptical about all the plastic (considered it cheap).  When we did a small 9 x 9 section of carpet and filled the container with pet hair, he was sold (and amazed)!

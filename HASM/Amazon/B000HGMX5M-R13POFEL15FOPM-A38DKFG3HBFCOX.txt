Title: We are better photographers now thanks to Nikon!
Content:
We originally purchased a Panasonic DMC-FZ50 to be an all-purpose family camera and were sorely disappointed.  The D80 is everything that Panasonic's near-DSLR is not - fast, accurate, crystal clear.  Whether an advanced user or a beginner simply wanting a highly performing auto mode, the D80 exceeds expectations.
Paired with an appropriate lens, the D80's auto mode catches a flurry of high-speed, action photos of our toddler.  The speed and accuracy have helped us catch more fleeting smiles and funny faces than we had been able to ever catch before.  It seemed as though we were always a second late with our prior camera.
I stopped short of a 5 star rating because the D80 does omit some nice features that the higher-end D200 offers.  Specifically, the ISO and Wb settings atop the D200 help make experimentation (and learning) somewhat easier.  But, nice as they are, the cost of the D200 made those optional for us.  After a month with the D80 (and about 3000 photos), we don't miss them.  New users shouldn't be intimidated and experts already understand that the Nikon name stands for quality.  By the way, the Nikon site offers a great online tutorial for the D80 that does not exist for the D40s or D60.  Buy it.  You'll love it.

Did any of the reviewers who gave this product 1 star actually purchase and use this item??  I'm a mechanical engineer and see no flaws in the design of this product.  It makes great, consistant coffee EVERY time and is less than half the price of the make and models everyone is comparing this to!  IF you got a defective unit, return it and get another!  This is a fantastic unit.  The grinder seems excessively loud, but that's not enough for me to knock it down a star.  This small annoyance is more than made up for by the fact that I can come home for lunch, 4 or 5 hours after making coffee in it, and still find HOT (not just warm) coffee in the carafe...unless the wife has drank it all.

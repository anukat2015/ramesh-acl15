Title: 2 years later this vacuum is STILL phenomenal
Content:
I know what you're thinking...phenomenal seems a bit strong when referring to something as mundane as a vaccum cleaner.  Even so, I purchased this vaccum in the July 2006 and it's the only word I can use to describe it even two years later.  Ordinarily, I'm not passionate about vaccuming...or vaccums, in general...but the Hoover WindTunnel has made my life easier and my carpet and velvet couches look fabulous and fur-free.  You see, the furry little man of my dreams is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and he is VERY furry.  Seriously, I brush him every week and you could knit sweaters with the undercoat I remove.  No amount of brushing stops him from shedding, either.  In the past, I have jokingly suggested that I might need to put Nair in his doggie shampoo.  Now that I have a Hoover WindTunnel, I have no reason to make such crude jokes.  I have had zero problems with mine, it still looks new after 2 years of use, it is super easy to clean the baggless canister and even the filter...and you wouldn't believe the dirt and dust this vaccum pulls out of the carpet.  The suction is still very powerful.  Okay, now I'm just gushing.  I love it.  I hope it lasts forever. I give it my highest recommendation. The end.

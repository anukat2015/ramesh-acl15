Title: Great Vacuum!
Content:
This Hoover has several really clever features.  First, the controls are all right at your fingertips in the handle.  The suction control is great, and when you turn it up all the way - WOW!
The handle is one-piece with a telescoping feature to adjust to your height.  This also makes it easy to stretch it out really long and get under the bed easily. 
I really like the bagless feature - I'll never buy another 'bagged' vacuum again.  I carry the dust container out to the garage and empty it in a grocery bag, then tie up the bag.  The dust never gets a chance to 'poof' back out into the house. 
Overall, a great vacuum and well worth the price.

Title: bad laptop 1 yr wasted
Content:
Well i bought this laptop before going to college and on paper it was a great buy for the price. probably the cheapest dualcore for the perfect 14.1 in screen with webcam and a cool looking glossy finish. But the first time i booted the system, the thing froze on me but i credit that to vista and its numerous problems. A few weeks after buying when the circuit city return period had finished, thelaptop started heating like crazy. The fans seemed to be working but the laptop was like a heater. Then the webcam stopped working and the inbuilt microphone never worked. Had it sent to hp after 3 months for repairs and got the laptop back just like i had sent it. sent it back again a few months later, same deal. this time with a torrid experience with customer support where they kept me on hold constantly and losing my ticket number and record. sent it again 3rd time cuz the display stopped working and waited 45 days only for hp to send the laptop to my home address when i explicitly told them to send it to my college address. It would be fine if the freaking thing was fixed though. apart from the display the whole thing still fumed like a grill. Soon the cd drive stopped recognizing media, which is when i called HP seeking a replacement. The technical support told me that the case managers would call me withing 24 hours which did not happen for 2 weeks after i had inquired twice. finally i called the case managers myself after getting their number. The only good thing and the reason i give it a 1 star is that hp will replace my laptop. Im hoping that the laptop i had was a faulty unit and its not the whole dv2000 series that's screwed over.

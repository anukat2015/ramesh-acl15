Title: Shipping it to Canon for the third repair
Content:
I purchased the Canon 50D in the spring of 2009 because I was so pleased with my 20D and thought it was time to update. It has been a major disappointment.  I've shipped it to Canon for three repairs. When it works I get nice pictures, but I also get nice pictures with my 20D. In most cases the pictures taken with the 20D are sharper with much less noise.  The viewfinder and LCD monitor are much nicer on the 50D compared to the 20D but picture quality is most important to me and the extras are not worth the price of this camera.  If you purchase the 50D be sure to check it out carefully the first 30 days so that you can return it to Amazon if it is defective.  Canon technical staff was very nice and acknowledged the problems but they have not been able to make this camera work as it should. When I requested a replacement camera I was told that is not an option under the warranty.  Based on my experience, I do not believe that Canon honors their warranties and I would not recommend this camera to anyone.

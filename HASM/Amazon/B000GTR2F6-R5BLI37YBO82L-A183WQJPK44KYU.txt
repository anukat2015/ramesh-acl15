Title: The Best Cup of Coffee Ive Ever Had at Home!
Content:
I just bought the Keurig Brewing System for my dorm room. It is WONDERFUL! It's easy, convenient, and mess free! I had read some reviews claiming it to be noisy, but all it does is hum for about 5 seconds before and after brewing. If people think that is 'noisy' then they need to get they're ears checked. My first cup was from 'The Coffee People' (It came in the sample pack of 18 k-cups). It was honestly the best cup of coffee I have ever had from a home brewer- rich, full-bodied, and not a hint of bitterness. The airtight seal on the k-cups certainly did its job of keeping the coffee fresh. I cannot wait to try all of the other brands! Another feature that I love is that the drip tray comes off to make room for my travel mug. I am already in love with this machine! I recommend this product to annyone who loves coffee, but doesnt want to waste time or money by making a whole pot.

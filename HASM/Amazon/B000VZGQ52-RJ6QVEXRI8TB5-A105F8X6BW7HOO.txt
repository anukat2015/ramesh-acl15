Title: great, versitile heater
Content:
I bought this model heater from Sam's club, for the same price as Amazon. It has easy to use thermostat and fan controls, puts out plenty enough heat for most small bedrooms, and has a great fan output while remaining very quiet by using a blower instead of regular fan blades. I aimed it blowing under my bed and it keeps the mattress warm as with the room. Definitely the best heater for the price range I've ever found.

Title: has permanent filter basket, but no pause-n-serve or auto-off
Content:
I didn't think I'd miss the pause-n-serve, but I do. I like the permanent filter basket, it lets more coffee solids through for a more flavorful cup. But just when you think it's safe to pour, it dribbles. There are also two holes in the back just above the 5-cup waterline. If you fill it and move it back under the cabinet, you may splash some water through these holes. The unit does not shut off automatically either. I do like the way the basket lifts entirely out of the unit. Do yourself a favor, spend an extra 5 bucks and get a different model.

Title: Good --not great
Content:
I bought my Roadster 2 1/2 years ago.  Initally it was great. I especially liked the velveteen strip that rolled up the dog hair out of the area rugs. I didn't like the incredibly short cord. I use an industrial power cord so I don't have to keep changing plug in locations.  Mostly I have hardwoods and it did okay.  Recently the wheel clips started breaking off and now one is completely off. The stair cleaning attachment fell completely apart the other day even though it was seldom used. The filters need replacing as does the wheel. Finding an online resource is proving close to impossible.  I'm looking for a new vacuum now.  And guess what--the new one won't be a Shark!

Title: HIde the cat, secure the baby....
Content:
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting one of the strongest vacuum cleaners known to man..... Actually, I wouldn't go that far, but let's just say it's a good idea to put pets outside, babies upstairs, pick up anything you don't want sucked into this Hoover. 
I'm in an old 1837 farmhouse that has floorboards with gaps the size of texas. In those gaps is possibly hair and soot that is almost 200 years old. I put this Hoover to the test on highest power and I could not believe the stuff this thing sucked up. Let me just say that for the price and paired with the nice design, this is the best vacuum cleaner I've ever owned. Success with yet another purchase! 
I highly recommend this baby. The canister for the filth is a bit smaller than I'd like, but that just shows how MUCH gross stuff this thing sucks out of your carpets and floors. The chord is long which I like. The carpet head is a bit bulky but works great.
HEPA filter keeps nasty dirt and dust out of the air vents and securely tucked away.

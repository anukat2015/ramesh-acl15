Title: The mouse that roared
Content:
I have never had an electric heater before so I wasn't sure what to expect. Especially when I heard so many horror stories about electric heaters starting home fires. However, I wanted a small heater to use on my legs and feet when I am sitting at my computer. Being that the heater is a Honeywell, I figued I couldn't gone wrong with it and I bought it on sale so the price was cheap.
I can not raved highly enough about this heater. It is so small and yet it heats up my whole bedroom, which I was not expecting. I can pick it up and take it to any room or place where I need it. It truely is the mouse that roared.
When I read others who reviewed this heater, their biggest complaint was that there is no off and on switch. This is true. But, I wouldn't want to leave it plugged in when I am not using it anyway...just to be on the safe side. Buy it you won't regret it.

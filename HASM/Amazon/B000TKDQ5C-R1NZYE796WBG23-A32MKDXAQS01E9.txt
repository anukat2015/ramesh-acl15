Title: I'VE FOUND BETTER
Content:
My heater arrived quickly.  It heats well and the thermostat seems to work fine.  But the fan switch (off-low-high) has no difference between low and high.  Maybe it is just a defect with the one I have, but there is no audible difference between low and high.  It runs high in the low position.  The fan doesn't seem to blow as hard as some Holmes versions I have and it is noisier.  But it does heat the room I use it for (about 15x12).

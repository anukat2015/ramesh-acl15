Title: A Great Digital SLR at a Good Price
Content:
I've been the proud owner of the D40 for just over two days and I have to say I love this product. I was torn between buying a Canon G9 or other higher end compact point-and-shoot but finally settled on this camera. The pictures it produces are beautiful and there is no shutter delay and no next shot delay. The last two factors are what won me over to this reasonably priced DSLR. The 18-55mm zoom lens is terrific and yields an effective 27mm-83mm zoom. There are also tons of features built into this camera including filter effects, red-eye reduction, customizable display times for exposure settings, menus and image review. The macro produces beautiful results.
The only 'con' to this camera is that it weighs about a pound and a half. That's the downside to all DSLRs. But, one must remember that among cameras of this type, the D40 is one of the lightest and most compact around and that compact point-and-shoot cameras all suffer from shutter and next-shot delay.
With the kit lens it comes with it's a great experience right out of the box. I highly recommend this camera.

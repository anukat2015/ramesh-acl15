Title: small enough, light enough, and sucks very well
Content:
I have had the Mighty Mite for about a month, and it works well with a very hairy dog and a cat, and mostly hard floors with a few rugs. It has lots of suction, but is light enough to carry easily. It small enough to drag around furniture, and is stable enough to not topple over when dragged. The cord and hose are usually long enough. 
I absolutely love HEPA filters - no vacuum smell.
It can't clean carpets as well as a powered head. I use an upright periodically. 
There is no "Pet Lover" magic; it is still hard to get hair off of upholstery. 
The bag is medium-sized, and filled in a few weeks with pet hair and leaves and dirt that the dog tracks in. The bags are cheap.
A retractable cord would be nice, but not worth the extra size and weight.

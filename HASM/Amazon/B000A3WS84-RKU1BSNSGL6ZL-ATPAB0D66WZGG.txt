Title: A Must Have!!!
Content:
I love my iPod. It is perfect. It plays movies,photos, and music. All it needs is to play games and it'll be a PSP. It's so easy to get videos onto it. The easiest way I've found is to download videos from Google Video. Or you could pay on iTunes. I was using it everyday until my brothr dropped it into the toilet. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF! (: Luckily I brought the Bestbuy warranty and it's being serviced as I type. Can't wait to get it back. Apple just keeps comin out with better and better iPods. Maybe the next one will have a radio...

Title: warranty not what it seems
Content:
My vacuum worked great for a while, but the filters were not as effective as they should have been, and when the motor started making noise, I took it back to the dealer. He honored the warranty for the motor, but claimed the cord rewind mechanism was also bad, though it seemed to work fine. He charged me for a new chord mechanism ($115) and then told me that the original 7-year warranty was voided, and the new part would only have a one-year warranty. So the vacuum cleaner that I purchased less than 2 years ago, specifically because it had a 7-year warranty, has now turned into a vacuum with a warranty lasting only 2 years and 8 months.

Title: Bunn NHBX-B Contemporary 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer
Content:
Bought the BUNN because of its reputation and it definitely makes DELICIOUS hot coffee in under 3 minutes. I also love that the water doesn't start to drip until the cover is returned to the correct position.  Prevents spilling and burns.  However, it lacks a 2 hour automatic turn off timer, so you have to remember to shut it off.
I bought this model because it was prettier than the original home model, but it still lacks design details. It may not be "important" in the coffee world, but those of us who enjoy good coffee, still want a pot that shows "form that follows function!"  Now if they could only, make it look as beautiful as the  wonderful coffee that it makes.  If I were grading it like a term paper, I'd take off points for "missed" details. I'd give it an A-.

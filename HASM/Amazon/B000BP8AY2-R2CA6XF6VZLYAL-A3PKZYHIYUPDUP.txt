Title: My first MP3 player
Content:
The Sansa M250 is my first MP3 Player.  The Sansa does exactly what I expected it to do.  I have not been disappointed and nothing has given me an overwhelming sense of awe.  It is very easy to use.  One thing I don't like: the player does not do sound recording if the battery is half dead.

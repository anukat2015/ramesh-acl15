Title: SmartBrew Coffeemaker
Content:
This is the second Black and Decker SmartBrew coffeemaker we have owned. We liked the first one so much, we searched until we found another one. It suits our needs perfectly, does not have a lot of bells and whistles, just a dependable, easy to use coffeemaker. We also like the carafe that comes with the unit. It is easy to pour with it and there are no problems with spilling as we have found with others.
We are very pleased with this product and how it performs.

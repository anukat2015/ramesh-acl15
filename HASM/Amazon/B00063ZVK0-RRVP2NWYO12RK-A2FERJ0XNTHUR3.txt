Title: Works amazingly well
Content:
I live in a 37' motor home full time and use this heater to heat the living room and kitchen area. It works great and is very quiet. It provides an even heat through out the area. I like the adjustable thermostat and how it works to regulate the temperature (by adjusting fan speed and heat output). I have used all of the other types of heaters out in the market today and while some are better than others, none come close to the performance of this heater. It does cost more than the other types of heaters but it is well worth the extra money. It may take you a day or two to get used to how this heater operates compared to the other types but just set the temperature to where you want it and then leave it alone and let it do its job.
I highly recommend this heater.

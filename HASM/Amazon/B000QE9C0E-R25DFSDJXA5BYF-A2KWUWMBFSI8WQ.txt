Title: A Breeze to use
Content:
I really like this vacuum cleaner!  It is so lightweight. The width enables me to vacuum between my dining room chair legs (I don't have to move all of the chairs away from the table).  The suction power (12 amp) really deep cleans.  The price is awesome!  I recommend this vacuum to anyone!

Title: Nice heater, some minor complaints and no tip-over protection
Content:
Overall, I'm very pleased with the Lasko 751320 Ceramic heater.  I work in a cold office, and I basically run the heater at least half the day almost year round.  The heater can be run on low or high, or it can be set to a temperature setting which I must operate on some kind of thermostat principle.  The latter could be very helpful in a small room.  (In a large office, it's not useful, since the ambient air isn't ever going to increase in temperature significantly.  The heater works by blowing warm air on me, not by warming up the room.)
Pros:
1.) Temperature option
2.) Works well; no problems so far
3.) Not too loud
4.) Comes with remote control
5.) Has overheat protection
Cons:
1.) No unheated air-blowing (fan only) option; air has to be heated
2.) Can't disable the beeping that occurs whenever you press a button to change a setting
3.) No tip-over protection!  This means you can't use it in many offices.  It does have overheat protection, but in many locations tip-over protection is required.

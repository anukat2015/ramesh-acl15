Title: Small, effective, inexpensive and energy efficient
Content:
I have a fairly small bedroom (8' x 14') in the city in a 2 bedroom apartment.  My roommate and I decided to get heaters for our bedrooms for this winter to try to save some money on our gas bill.  At first I was suspicious about this small heater's ability to heat my room.  My room feels really toasty right now.  I am thankful that I gave this a shot.  Although I havent received my electric bill yet to compare to our gas bills, I am almost for certain that we saved a bunch of money.  
The cool thing about this unit is that there is one knob that controls 2 heat power settings (hi and low) and 1 cool setting.  the other knob has the ability to control the strength of heat (cool to hot).  I tried the cool setting, it's not as powerful as an AC, but it cools better than a fan.

Title: Great fan, not so great cooler
Content:
I knew when I purchased this item that it was NOT an air conditioner and that I should not expect the cooling power of an air conditioner. I did expect that it would lower the room temperature by 12 degrees as advertised. After reading the instructions, setting it up, and filling the tank, I let it run in a small bedroom from 5pm until 11pm. After 6 hours the room was not only still hot, but now it was hot and slightly humid as well. People said this works better in dry climates. I live in Southern California surrounded by desert, about as dry as you can get. I felt I had givin it a fair chance and returned the machine.

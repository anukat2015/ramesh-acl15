Title: Good Coffee Machine
Content:
Well after 15 years with Mr. coffee I finally decided to get a new coffee maker.  After doing a lot of research and reading all the reviews I decided on the Cuisinart.  The coffee is wonderful.  I highly recommend this one.  Sure there are a few things that aren't perfect like the on/off switch, not sure why they designed it this way.  None of the things I have found so far are bad.  Great machine love the look.

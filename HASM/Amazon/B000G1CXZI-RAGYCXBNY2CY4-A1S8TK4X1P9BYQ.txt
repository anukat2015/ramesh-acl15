Title: Great when it's not leaking oil on your hardwood floors.
Content:
So I ordered two of these items. Both worked as described right out of the box with little noise or drying effect of the air you get with other types of radiating floor heaters (the ones with fans built-in). I use one to keep my cat warm at night. He sleeps in the tub - out of reach of the central heat. I use the other unit in my office to save money by heating only the rooms in use at the time. The only problem is this second unit started dripping oil all over my hardwood floors and Persian rug. As you can imagine, I wasn't too thrilled, but Amazon is refunding my purchase price so I'm satisfied. I plan to keep the other unit until it breaks.

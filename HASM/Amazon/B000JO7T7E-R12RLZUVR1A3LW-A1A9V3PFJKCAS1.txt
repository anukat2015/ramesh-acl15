Title: This is my first iPod ever.
Content:
I bought mine a few weeks ago at the Post Exchange on a whim and I LOVE it! I was lucky to be able to purchase this because we live on a US Army base in South Korea and they sold out quickly. I am sure I could have gotten one out in town but I don't know if I would have the same tech support. 
Anyway, this is my first iPod I ever bought and I think it's perfect and it's in my favorite color, blue! 
I read some people have trouble with the wheel or that the screen is too small but I don't have any trouble since I have no experience with any previous iPods and I can see the picture just fine. My son has the classic video 30GB iPod he bought over the summer but I never used it. He really wanted mine when I got it but too bad, he has to stick with the one he has! 
Do buy a case for it. I bought a hard clear case for mine because I carry it in my pocket all the time. That's the nice thing about shopping out in town in Seoul, an abundance of accessories for any type of techno gadget. If you are ever in Seoul, visit the electronice market, it will make your head spin.

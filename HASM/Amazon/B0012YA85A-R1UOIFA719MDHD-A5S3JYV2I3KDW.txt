Title: The Canon XSi is a Snap!
Content:
I've had the XSi a little over a month and have taken over a thousand snaps. To call this a low end dSLR is a bit misleading. It's an awful lot of camera for the money and will shoot pro shots in the hands of a pro photographer. 
It's a bit less durable than its pro siblings and the burst rate may be a shot slower but the XSi's lightweight composition and miniaturization could be considered an advantage. Having a camera handy to get "the" shot is half of photography and this kit with the addition of a Canon 55-250 IS I bought fits neatly in a Crumpler $5M Home bag. 
If I had twice as much to spend I might consider a Nikon D90 or Canon 50D but if want to save a fortune and take great shots look no further than the XSi. I also recommend Ben Long's XSi Companion in addition to the excellent XSi manual.

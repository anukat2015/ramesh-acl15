Title: Acer Aspire AS1410-8414 w/ Windows Vista Home Premium
Content:
This "mini-laptop" has worked flawlessly from the minute I turned it on and began configuring/loading software on it. The 11.6-in. display is terrific - extremely sharp (text/graphics) and renders colors beautifully. In addition, the laptop is well made with a solid casing and a high-gloss blue lid.
The lack of an internal CD/DVD drive is no problem at all. For about $60 I picked up an external USB CD/DVD drive at Fry's Electronics here in Southern California and it's worked as advertised.
One thing you do need to think about, though, before you purchase this Acer: If you're used to "regular-size" keyboards, the Acer's keyboard will take a little getting used to because of the machine's small size. For me, it took about a day to get used to the keyboard but now it's all good.

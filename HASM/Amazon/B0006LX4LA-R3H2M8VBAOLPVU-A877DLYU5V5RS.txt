Title: Looks Better Than It Is
Content:
I purchased this coffeemaker because of the stainless steel carafe. The problem is when you pour coffee into a cup, it goes all over, I have to pour off the kitchen sink. No matter how slow or fast, it makes a mess. The second problem is when the coffee sits on the warmer, it starts to boil. This may be a problem with just this one. I would not purchase this item again.

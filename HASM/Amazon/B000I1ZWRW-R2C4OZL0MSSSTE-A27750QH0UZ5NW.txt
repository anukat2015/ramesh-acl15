Title: Great Mid-Level DSLR
Content:
I bought this camera for a 2 week trip oversees (mostly landscape and portrait pictures).
Pros: 
- I used it for 2 weeks 600+ pictures without having to re-charge
- This is my first DSLR and I was able to use it without many problems (except I kept forgetting to go from the canned landscape mode to portrait mode to get the flash)
- I got a good kit lens that takes great sharp pictures
Cons:
- The first one I got had a bad pixel in the LCD.  Luckily Amazon is great and did an exchange for me.  The even sent me the new one before I returned the first one!
Forget what you've read about the body being too small...  I didn't use a huge heavy lens or flash, but this camera was fine to use while walking around viewing sites and taking pictures.  I could see how it may be a problem if you are holding it for hours on end, but I used the strap.  One other piece of advice would be to keep your pocket camera for times when you don't want to carry a camera bag with the DSLR in it.  This was a beast to take to dinners and clubs.  
Overall seems like a great camera (only had it for a month now).  I'm still learning a lot about it.

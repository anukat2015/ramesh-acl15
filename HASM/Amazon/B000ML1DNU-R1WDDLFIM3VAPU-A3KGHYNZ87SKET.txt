Title: great for the price
Content:
I received this vacuum and it is perfect for the downstairs of our house which is all wood floors and area rugs.  I would recommend it highly for tile and wood flooring, but not for wall to wall carpeting unless you use this as a second vacuum for quick clean ups.  It is very light and the suction seems to be great so far (I am pretty fussy about the vacuums we own).  The best thing is that it is so small and light that I find myself taking it out to vacuum a lot more than with my old, heavier vacuum.  So even if it doesn't have as much suction, I think that my house is cleaner b/c it is not such a pain in the butt to drag out the vacuum cleaner.  Just one way of looking at it!  Works for me!

Title: Beautiful, not the best design for function though
Content:
This is the most beautiful space heater known to man.  I want to put it on a pedestal in the middle of the room so everyone can stare at it.  I want to make it small and wear it around like a little hat, or take a picture of it and carry it in my wallet.  What I do *not* want to do is wait for the thing to heat a room.
Dont get me wrong, it heats just fine.  But the heat goes straight up.  Which is generally not where a person is located unless, like me, you are hovering over the thing trying desperately to get warm before hopping into icy sheets at night.
The heat just drifts out of it, doesnt blow in any direction, making your ceiling very warm I'm sure, but not terribly effective unless you want to turn the thing on an hour before bed, or have a ceiling fan blowing the heat back down on you.
It also doesnt have a timer, so you cant turn it on and go to bed knowing it will shut itself off before you dehydrate and wake up with your throat feeling like straw in the middle of the night.  Likewise, if you are like me, you cannot leave the thing going and know that you will not forget to come back and turn it off so your house doesnt burn down..  it will not turn itself off when you forget to ten hours later.
But damn, the thing is gorgeous.  :(

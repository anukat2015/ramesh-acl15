Title: Poorly constructed, emptying is a nightmare
Content:
Having had this vacuum for maybe 18 months now, I can tell you I thoroughly despise using it. Cleaning our relatively small studio apartment, I have to empty the device each and every time I clean: the capacity for collecting debris (before the suction power becomes too poor) is just that small.
Whilst that wouldn't normally be a huge concern, just emptying the device is a huge pain. The cheap, plastic of the debris container seems to attract dust (statically charged?) and my attempts to flip the lid off (dust everywhere), shake it upside down (more dust everywhere) and then need to unclog the filter by hand (even more dust everywhere) seems to make the whole "HEPA" thing a lot less of an attraction when you're breathing it in anyway each time you empty it.
Add to that the fact one of the cleaning attachments has already split, and I can assure you that this is not the vacuum cleaner for you.

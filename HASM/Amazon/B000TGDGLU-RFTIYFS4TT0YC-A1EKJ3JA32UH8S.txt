Title: Good product, worth the money
Content:
It heats my office well. 13X8 feet and 9 feet high. Very warm and even heat. It works well in any room with a door on it. I tried it in my living room which connects to my kitchen and it did OK, but not as good in an enclosed room - my apartment is mid-sized. It's best for single rooms with doors. I turn it up on full and then lower it to medium once it reaches my desired temp. It takes about 15-20 minutes to really feel the heat, so be patient. People said they smelled fumes - perhaps, if you follow the directions and let it run in your basement or well-ventilated area for a few hours you wouldn't have that problem. I do hear clicking sounds every once in a while, but it doesn't bother me. As a person who's sensitive to dry air (and this being winter time), I usually run a small humidifier next to it. But at low settings, you might not even have to use a humidifier (depending on your body and humidity in your area).

Title: My dream come true!
Content:
I've had this camera in my Shopping Cart forever!  
I got excited every single time I received a notification that the price of the 'item' decreased.  
I finally decided to buy it.  
I've been researching Canon's DSLR cameras for about 5 months now.  
The Canon Rebel XSi  is amazing-all around.
Great price, great camera.
I chose this camera over the T1i.  I figure, why not save the $200 and invest in other essential accessories.
I've recently purchased Opteka Battery Pack Grip / Vertical Shutter Release with Charger, 2 LP-E5 Batteries), Wireless Remote, Cleaning Kit, & Mini Tripod 
and Aktiv PAK Professional All Weather Multi Purpose Photo/ Computer Laptop Backpack + Accessory Kit for Canon Rebel XSi Digital SLR Cameras and I basically got the camera & all the needed equipment for the same price as the T1i.  
The product overall is awesome.
I live in Hawaii and I received my package within 3 days.  I love Amazon.com!  Free shipping is the best!!
 Cons:
This product doesn't come with a bag/case for both the camera and lens for immediate use.  No big deal.  I'm happy with the one I ordered separately.

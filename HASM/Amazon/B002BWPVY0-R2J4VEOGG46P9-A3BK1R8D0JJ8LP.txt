Title: excellent value
Content:
this is an excellent laptop for everyday tasks like email, document & photo editing, itunes etc. it is not a gaming machine. it is among the lightest in its class at 5.4 pounds and looks solidly built. the preinstalled vista premium boots up fast. no issues that I can think of. some sites have talked about the power plug coming loose inside the laptop; hope toshiba has fixed it in this model. i removed the shovelware and norton, installed avg and IE8 and it works great.

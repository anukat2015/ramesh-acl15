Title: Good with some concerns..
Content:
Very nice but not perfect. 
Makes a loud relay click when it comes on. I have two of these heaters, they both do this.  Getting used to this over time. 
Does not put out large amounts of heat so if you live somewhere with actual cold this is probably not to
be used as primary heat.  It could be used to warm up a room over what your furnace is doing for the entire house. If you live in Coastal California, then it works fine.

Title: Loved It !!!  Great on my Pergo floors
Content:
I read all the reviews and decided I would try it anyway.  We have about 800 sq. ft. of pergo flooring and it was very hard on my back to clean with a mop then hand drying with a towel.
I went through my house with ease and efficiency.  It left no streaking or water marks behind and the floors looked as good as the day we put them down  The suction was very good and took up all the water.  I used the floor cleaner solution that came with the machine, it left a clean scent behind, but will also try just using vinegar and water next time as recommended by Pergo.
I'm very please with the machine and no longer dread cleaning my pergo floors.

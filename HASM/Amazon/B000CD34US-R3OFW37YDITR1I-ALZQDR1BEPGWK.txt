Title: Do not buy
Content:
The first one I bought burned into the hopper, I took it back and got another one.  This one wouldn't burn properly and there aren't any instructions in the manual on how to change settings, called tech support and they told me there wasn't anything they could do to help me.  I had to replace parts on it 6 times in 3 months and had to wait 2 weeks each time for parts to fix it.  Finally got sick of it not working and took it back, after a week of calling 4 times a day to get a return authorization number.
Not a good company to deal with.

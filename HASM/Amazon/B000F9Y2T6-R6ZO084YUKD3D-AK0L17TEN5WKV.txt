Title: Great for my hardwood floors
Content:
Whether I used a regular mop and bucket, my swiffer wet jet, or my hoover steam vac, I always ended up with a haze on my hardwood floors that I would clean off with a wipe or furniture polish.  This is the first machine that leaves my floor shiny and without a haze.  It is worth it just for that!!!  I also like the job it does on my lineoleum.  The first couple of times I used it on what I thought were clean floors because I had recently mopped them, I was surprised at how dirty the water was.  After using this as my primary means to clean my floors (two maybe three times a week depending on traffic and what is going on in my household) I notice that my floors not only look cleaner, but also feel much cleaner on the few occassions when I am not wearing house slippers. This is so much better than the regular mopping. 
I have read other reviews on the flip-it regarding water being left on the floor; when that does happen, I just go back over that section so that it will be taken care of.   For the most part I don't care about a little water on the floor because I would have so much more if I had the mop and bucket or used my steam vac.  I am sold!

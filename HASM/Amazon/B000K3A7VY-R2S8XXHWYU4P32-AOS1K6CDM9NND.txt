Title: We are buying another!!
Content:
Well I came to this page because after 3 years of un-pampered use our pot stopped working this morning.  We are so hard on coffee pots they have never even lasted 1 year.  We will be buying another one of these without even thinking about it so... I thought it only fair to let others know. Two more things, I did only clean it once during those 3 years - I know that's gross but I am so busy!! The other thing is we also brew more then one pot a day a couple of days a week - so heavy use too. Anyway it's a great pot for the price.

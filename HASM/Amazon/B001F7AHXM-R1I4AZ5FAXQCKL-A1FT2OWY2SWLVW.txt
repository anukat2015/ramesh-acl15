Title: 120GB iPod Classic - Music to my ears!
Content:
The iPod Classic is an excellent item. My wife loves it. She has already put over 5000 songs on the unit plus a full movie.
Beware of low price Amazon sellers - the one I ordered this from did not come through for me. (gems and points aka Trade & Save)
I purchased mine at a local retail store here in Michigan for only slightly more than the gems and points price.

Title: Good heat, small package
Content:
Bought one for my girlfriend to use in her bathroom for extra heat when showering. Works great, lots of heat for a small heater. Only dislike is the shallow depth of the carry handle. But when the handle is the only gripe, you know this has to be rated a good buy. 
If they offered this with a built in timer to automatically kick on a few minutes early for the morning shower... nirvana.

Title: Great Coffee, Imperfect Design
Content:
I bought the DeLonghi DCM485 after reading reviews on all the other thermal carafe coffee makers I could find. My wife and I are quite pleased with the quality of the coffee this unit brews. Keep in mind that we are somewhat coffee "snobs", at least that's how my Mom views us :-) . 
The unit has one flaw, at least ours does. On occasion, the switch that interrupts coffee flow while brewing (so you can sneak a cup before brewing is complete) would stick, resulting in coffee flowing all over the countertop. With another coffeemaker, I would have returned the unit and purchased another model. I decided to jerry-rig the switch so it stays open because we really do like the coffee from this machine.
Were it not for that glitch, I would give this product 5 stars. No one else seems to have reported this problem, so perhaps we were just unlucky.

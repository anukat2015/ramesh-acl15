Title: Despite negative comments
Content:
I did a lot of research in trying to find a decent coffeemaker.  I read about thin carafes, complicated instructions, flimsy lids and all the rest. All I know is that I'm pretty happy with this product.  If you read the manual it's pretty obvious how to operate all the bells and whistles it comes with, but I will admit it is hard to remember all that stuff at 5:30 in the morning.  So, if you just want good coffee in the morning, do what I did and shut it all off.  When and if the carafe breaks, I'll buy another one, which by the way costs about the same as other name brands if you do the research. The bottom line is that it it is quick, fairly quiet and does what it is supposed to do, which is make great coffee.

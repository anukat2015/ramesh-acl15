Title: Stopped Working After 6 Months
Content:
I expect years of faultless service from a premium appliance with the Cuisinart name.  It can't make good coffee if it does not work!  One day it just stopped working.  I unplugged the unit and plugged it in several minutes later and thought all was well.  When I poured water into the reservoir it just poured right out the bottom onto my counter.  I suspect something may have melted the plastic, but am still waiting on a response from Customer Service to see if they replace it before I start disassembling it to see what happened.  The design is great, but I suspect cheap components and poor QC are at fault.

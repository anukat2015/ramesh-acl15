Title: Vacuum is as vacuum does
Content:
So this model has a very simple and inexpensive design rugged but a trip down a flight of stairs may surely damage the product yet the unit is made to have cheap replacement parts. As with more expensive brands the parts are costly and not as economical to repair. I find that the motorized head is light weight durable and easy on the effort and as opposed to other more heavy attachment, this unit is easier to manuver around. The absents of a swivel hose both at wand and canister puts stress on the hose but tis cheap enough to replace.

Title: 80G Zune
Content:
I had a 40G zune before I purchased this 80G. It works as well as the first MP3 player I purchased. I wouldn't have expected anything different. The main reason I purchased this player was because I had filled my 40G with tunes. An upgraded was definetly necessary. I have tranfered all the tunes I had in my previous player plus 100 more. I like the convenence of having tunes during my commute to and from work. Nothing like cruising down the road with a helmet full of tunes. Life doesn't get much sweeter than that!

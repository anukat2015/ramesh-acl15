Title: Good small heater
Content:
I bought two of these and they work great.  The dish nicely focuses their 300 watts of silent heat to warm you up to 6 feet away.  Dish heaters have more "reach" in the sense that they don't have to blow hot air all the way over to you, since they are basically heating with infra-red light (like the sun) instead of warm air.  They only heat what they shine on though.   Obviously 300 watts is fairly small, so don't expect this heater to heat an entire room.  Get a heater with 5 times and wattage and hence five times the operating expense in electricity if you want more total heat.
My one complaint about this unit is that the dish can be only aimed anywhere from level to partially upwards.  Very poor design considering a likely use is to put the heater on a surface above you and have it shine at a down angle, such as onto a couch or a bed.  Personally I don't want the heater on the ground where stuff is likely to come into contact with it.  But fortunately a little modification with a small saw on the plastic body can be done to open up the angle some and allow it to shine at a down angle as well.

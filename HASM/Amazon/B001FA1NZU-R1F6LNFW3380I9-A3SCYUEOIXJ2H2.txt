Title: Best device I have ever owned!
Content:
My hubby bought me a 16gb Ipod Touch for Xmas. At first I was a bit upset with the sync process.... it was frustrating transferring my old Ipod files to my new Ipod (my last Ipod died on me). It didn't take me long to fall in love with this though. It is incredible how much you can really do with this device! 
The app store is amazing and offers something for everyone and every lifestyle. I have apps that I can play games with, keep a diary, stay up to date with contacts on myspace and twitter, read the news, bring up maps, check the weather, create music, even track my period! :O)
It is not perfect though. I really wish there was a way to switch to another song without actually having to touch the screen... a little button on the side or something would be nice. It would have also been nice to have a camera built in like the Iphone. A microphone would have been great too.
All in all I am very pleased and the Ipod Touch exceeded my expectations!

Title: More Than Satisfied With First SLR
Content:
This is my first SLR camera and I have had it about a month now. The Olympus Evolt E510 has been very easy to use and I can definitely see the difference in the pictures taken with this camera as compared to my older compact digital camera. 
If you are looking for your first digital SLR I would definitely recommend the E510.

Title: It's Big, It's Bulky, It's Heavy, but it does what is says....
Content:
I stopped looking for the "One-for-All" vacuum cleaner, and with this bad boy we now approach our cleaning with a two pronged attack.  We have two Maltese and a Hyper-Active shedding Golden Retriever.  Our Kenmore Elite Canister Vac, albeit awesome for everyday cleaning, just couldn't keep up.
I picked this bad boy up, for the dedicated purpose of collecting pet hair off our carpets, couches, and floors.  It's big, it's bulky, it's heavy and a bit awkward, but, it does the job fantastically in regards to pet hair removal.
So, we clean everyday with our very versatile canister vac, and then once a week we wheel "big burtha" out of the closet and do the house a once over.  I'm impressed with it's ability to get the pet hair out of the carpets and furniture.
For the current price, you can't beat it.  The attachments are more of a novelty with this unit, nothing a good lint brush can't do and easier job of doing it, but for large areas, this is the king.

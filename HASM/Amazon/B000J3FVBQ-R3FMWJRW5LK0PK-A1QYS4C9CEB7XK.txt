Title: Overpromises and underdelivers.
Content:
I use this AC to cool my bedroom that's about 225 sq. ft. The manufacturer claims this unit is capable of cooling easily upto 250 sq. ft. 
I've been using this AC for a week. The air it puts out is definately cool but this AC cannot cool the room more than 2-3 degrees, yes, farenheit. It cools the room by a couple degrees in the first hour, after that I can't see any difference whether the AC is on or not. 
Well, ok, to be fair, the difference is that it does make noise and consume gobs of power without cooling anything.

Title: Nice for hardwood floors
Content:
Our house is 2/3 hardwood floors and we have 2 Labradors and 3 rabbits.  I've been looking for something to help with the hair problem on the hardwood and this vacuum works great.  Until I got this I was using a stand up floor vacuum and a ShopVac which which were both cumbersome.  This little vacuum moves around so much better and has a lot more suction.  The hardwood floor attachment works great but the rabbit fur does build up on the brush.  After I vacuum I have to take the head off and vacuum it.  I haven't tried the vacuum on carpeted floors but I don't think it was meant for that.  Suction alone will not match the beater bar in a stand up.  I felt the vacuum was well made and it handles very well.
Pros
Lots of suction
Light weight
Convenient
Looks nice (in my opinion)
Cons
A bit loud
Bagless will get your hands dirty
I love this vacuum and would recommend it to any one else who just needs a light weight hardwood floor vacuum.

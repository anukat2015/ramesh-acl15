Title: Rubberized Palm Rest Peeling easily
Content:
First month after I bought this from Amazon, I would have given ***** for this laptop.
After 1 month, I changed my mind completely.
Hardware-wise, I would give a 5 stars, but the build-quality is very inferior.
The palm rest is rubberized, and I've been a little wary about this even before I bought this laptop because I know this type of material is not durable at all, esp. with such a thin layer of rubber over plastic.  AND I WAS RIGHT.
After 2 months, the rubberized palm rest starts to peel on the corner. In some areas, the rubberized surface began to create tiny air bubbles on the other corner.  I've just put the laptop around several times into my backpack (with protective sleeve).   Apparently mine is not the only case.  There have been reports from many users who reports this peeling problem after only a while.  Check out the N61JQ owner thread in [...], and you will see what I mean.
In my case, I can see the peeling starts to grow litle by little in only 1 month. 
I can't imagine what this laptop will look like within a year if the peeling keeps getting worse at this rate.
I can predict , this laptop will become the ugliest notebook I ever owned after 1 year of use, and I know that's going to happen.
I've been using Dell & Lenovo laptop for 3-4 years, and the palm rest doesn't show any wear, but this one has become ugly just within 2 months.  Imagine that !
Beware of the rubberized palm rest area, that peeling will drive you crazy.

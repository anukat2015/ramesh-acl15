Title: The camera is worth the shot!
Content:
I bought this camera as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. She was looking for a semi-pro camera. She was fascinated about how friendly the Rebel XTi is! I just borrowed it from her to make a outdoor shooting and boy is this camera good! It's easy to handle, takes hi res L+ RAW PICTURES, and for what it's worth it, it's a really good deal. The classic "value for money" expression would apply to the Rebel XTi
This is one of those cameras that's going to become a classic of its kind difficult to beat.

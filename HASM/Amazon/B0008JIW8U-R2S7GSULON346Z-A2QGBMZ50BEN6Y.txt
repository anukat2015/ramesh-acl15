Title: great coffee maker for the price
Content:
This is a great little coffee maker. It's small, doesn't take up space on my counter top, and makes the perfect amount of coffee for one large travel mug. The timer works without any problems. The only issue which I have seen in other reviews is the clock keeping time. However, in over a month, I had to bump up the time one minute only once and it's really easy. Just push the minute button and done. It makes great coffee, no offensive odors or tastes. I would definitely recommend this coffee pot to any friends.

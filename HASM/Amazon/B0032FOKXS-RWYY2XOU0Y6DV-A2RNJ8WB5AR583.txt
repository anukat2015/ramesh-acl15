Title: What are you waiting for - buy it!!
Content:
First off, I am not a gamer, not even a little, so if you are reading this looking for a gaming computer review, sorry.
With that over, I have had my machine for approximately 10 days and I love it.  Yes it does show some fingerprints, oh well, but as far as screen brightness, overall speed and functionality, I love it.
I agonized for over a month on purchasing this machine or waiting on the 12 hour battery version.  I finally had to purchase one and I am glad I picked this model.  Why, first I can purchase the larger battery and since the sellers have bumped the price up another 30 bucks I will have 2 batteries for a few extra bucks.  Do I get over 10 hours, no.  Do I get a lot of usable time, yes, do I want to buy the bigger battery? yes and I probably will get it.
Second, this seems to be the only model that handles additional memory. I have not read anybody putting an extra 2 or 4 megs into the machine, but since memory has dropped in price, I will probably give it a shot and sell the extra 2 megs to someone that needs it.
I like the touch pad.  I have left the plastic on it and it works great.  However, it is like any other pad when it comes to thumbs.  Even with "touch freeze" I have trouble with dropping my thumbs.  
So am I happy - you betcha - would I buy it again - ditto.
So unless you are a high tech gamer, I recommend it highly.

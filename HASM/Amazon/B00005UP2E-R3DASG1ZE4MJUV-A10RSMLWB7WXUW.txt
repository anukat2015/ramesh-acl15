Title: Dust bunnies are toast!
Content:
I bought this for a space with nearly all hardwood floors. I had lots of trouble with dust bunnies collecting in corners and under furniture; sweeping them up was difficult and messy, and I rarely got them all.
This vac is the perfect compromise between a broom and a full canister vac. I use the strap to carry it around, and it has plenty of power to pick up medium sized dirt. And the dust bunnies just run to it, esp. from under furniture and from cable nests. Two of the attachments (the floor and detail brushes) are ideal for both large floor and spot cleaning, and some level of furniture dusting.
When you see what the HEPA filter catches, you'll be glad it's there. Stuff does get stuck to it, making emptying the dirt more challenging. It only needs to be done every third or fourth use, though. For the most uses it's clean, empty, and move on.
What they say about carpets is true: this vac does not do well there. None of the attachments really dig into the surface, so it only picks up loose dirt. But for hard surfaces/hardwood floors, this vac is a great compromise between size and power.

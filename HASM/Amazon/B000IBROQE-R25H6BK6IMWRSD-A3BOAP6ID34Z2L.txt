Title: Stop giving apple all your money!
Content:
Here's the deal, this is an awesome little MP3 Player. The sound quality is awesome, the graphics are great (you know, for a tiny little screen) and no portable player is really that easy to understand.  I'm shopping for a second one for my husband. And for all those who only support Apple, remember this, by continuing to buy the primary name brand, they will continue to gauge you for turning on them for windows computers. Besides, every time you download something from I-Tunes, they still get theirs. Shop smart, folks!

Title: Kudos to this Exceptional Heater
Content:
I bought one last year and this year.  I like the oscillating idea....it doesn't heat up a  huge great room but it does heat up a medium sized bedroom and you don't need all four hours, you can set it at 2 hours and still feel comfortable all night. It will automatically turn off.  The safety features, design, and that it rotates and emits great heat were my reasons for buying a second one.  If you're not too lazy to get up and turn it off and on, I'd suggest this one. The other model has a remote but I didn't buy that one. Just follow instructions and let the ceramic heater blow outdoors for about four hours (odor will leave). It's a quality heater that really works!  Kudos for Lasko on this model!

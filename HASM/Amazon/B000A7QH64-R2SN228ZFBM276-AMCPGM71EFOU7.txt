Title: Battery NOT COVERED Under 1 Year Warranty
Content:
After 6 months of use the custom battery now fails to hold a charge. Called customer support and was informed that NO parts that are "replaceable" are covered under the 1 year warranty. 
Pretty pathetic product quality and the warranty effectively excludes anything that will likely fail in normal use and yes I followed the recommendations regarding how to optimize the battery charge. 
Works great other then that... Shameful support and warranty exclusions.

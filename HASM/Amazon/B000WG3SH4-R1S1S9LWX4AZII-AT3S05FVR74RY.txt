Title: A Fantastic Upgrade
Content:
I recently purchased the 8gb Red Zune from a seller who was selling it refurbished. I bought it because I was tired of carrying my 30gb Zune around. I got an excellent deal on the 8gb, $75, and have been enjoying it thoroughly. So far, the Zune has worked great, and I have been very happy with my purchase. Now onto the nity and the grity...
Pros
-Small and Compact
-Easy to Use
-Extremely Portable
-It's Red!
-FM Radio with Song Tagging
-Online Marketplace when you're within a Wi-Fi Hotspot
-Ability to send songs to other Zune players, not just the 8 gig ones
Cons
-Only 8 gigs
-Sometimes crashes if you press two buttons at once or press them too fast
-The only information about the song displayed is the name and the artist, as apposed to the name, artist, and album like on the 30gb
But over all, an excellent player. I highly recommend it.

Title: d200 vs d80
Content:
Nikon D80 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body only)
i bought my d200 more than a year ago. i am in love with this camera. when i first bought this camera i was not sure if i made the right choice. it was right around the time d80 was released and i was asking myself if i did the right choice by buying the more expensive camera. wherever i looked it said d200 for half the price. d80 had all the automatic features but d200 had none. just P, A, S, M, which are also included in the d80. 
my dad is not into photography as i am. he wanted an slr but i thought he would be better off with a camera with more automatic features. i bought him a d80. and i used it for 4 months before i gave it to him. the first time i hold the d80 in my hand i knew that i made the right decision by buying d200 for myself. even when i was using the d80 i never even considered using the options other than P, A, S or M. The focus the durability of the camera and the feeling you have when you hold the camera is completely different. when you hold a d200 you feel like you are holding a professional camera that is build for people who push the camera to the limit. d80 feels like a well built camera that is made for amateurs. 
when you read the specks the only obvious difference you see between d200 and d80 is the burst speed 5fps to 3fps. but people forget to mention the buffer of the camera which is a bigger issue. d80 can take 3fps but if you shoot in raw you cannot shoot more than 4 frames before the buffer runs out, which means you need to wait for the camera to write the data on the card, and believe me it takes longer than what you think especially if you shoot raw. and because d80 takes SD cards not CF the cards are slower as well. d200 can shoot upto 20 images in raw+jpeg mode and if you use a fast card it takes lot less time for the camera to write the data on the card than it takes the d80.
just to make myself clear i am not saying d80 is a bad camera what i am saying is that it cannot substitute d200.
if you are not sure between d200 and d80, if you beliave you can do without the preset modes, and if you are willing to pay the extra GET D200

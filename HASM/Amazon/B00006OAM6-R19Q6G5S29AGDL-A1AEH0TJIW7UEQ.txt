Title: Lower your heating bills
Content:
Our house was built in 1902, with no insulation on the outside walls.  Our heating bills for the past three years have varied from $150 to over $300 - to be cold!  We purchased the WindChaser PAR201 model heater on my parents recommendation, knowing if gas increased as expected, we'd need all the help we could get.
Now, after two months, I can report with absolute certainty.  Our electric bill did increase, but only about $15/mo.  Our gas, on the other hand, went DOWN, yes down, $65.00!!!  We've never had gas bill this low since we've owned the house.  
We keep the WindChaser in the living room and it's like sitting in front of a fireplace.  In fact, my partner jokes with our friends that they should come over and we'll "have a fire". 
We've tried every imaginable type of heater, some in excess of $500.00, but this little thing is the BOMB!  We recommend it without whole heartedly.

Title: hardware great but i-tunes stinks.
Content:
First I would like to say this is a great piece of hardware and the internal software running this device is great.  I bought it because all my kids and wife joined the ipod bandwagon and I wanted the WiFi capabilites which aren't offered by many companies.  I am a software engineer and in the past have resisted Apple's products because of the way they lock you in with thier propriatary software.  
Well to say Apple's i-tunes has been optimized for Windows operating systems is a joke.  I have three Vista machines at home and on all three machines had one heck of a time.  It took my wife four attempts to get it to install on her new Dell Studio.  I have a Dell Studio as well and so far have attempted five installs before it took.  However once installed, i-tunes will not recongnize my touch.  Now come on Steve Jobs, I know you want me to buy one of your computers but forget it.  
I then went to buy an adaptor here on Amazon to play the ipod on my TV.  Turns out the new firmware has blocked all the $6 third party cables.  Now you have to buy an Apple cable for $50.  
Apple has a great product here, but just like in the PC wars of the 1980's they have won the early battles but will lose the war.  Apple has not changed, if you are a Windows user i-tunes blows.  Be prepared to be force fed the Apple cool aid and ripped off by thier accessories.
Personally I don't like to drink anyone's cool aid whether it's Microsofts or Apples.  Like I said above, this is a really cool product, to bad the manufacturer is making the same mistakes they made 25 years ago.  My advice would be to look elsewhare and get a player that works well on all operating systems, especially if you are a Windows user.

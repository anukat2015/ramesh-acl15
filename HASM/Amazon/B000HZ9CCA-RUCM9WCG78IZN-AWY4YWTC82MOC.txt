Title: All my friends want one!
Content:
I enjoy the Sansa e280 very much. Great video quality and the sound is terrific. Everyone who sees it wants one. Even people who own iPods have said they prefer my e280. The thumbwheel makes it very fast and easy to access menus and adjust volume. The FM radio feature makes it easy to use this MP3 player at events that broadcast for the hearing impaired. I can listen without distractions as well as record for future listening. A good deal!

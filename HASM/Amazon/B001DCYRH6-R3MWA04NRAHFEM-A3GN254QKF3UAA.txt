Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
We have tile and hardwood floors with 3 kids and 2 longhaired shelties..this vacuum is perfect for us.  It's very light, and the attachments are high quality and don't fall off like some other vacuums.  It's great for blinds, furniture, hard to reach areas, and the bag holds a LOT for such a small thing!  It's not the best for carpet (we only have a few area rugs), but it does okay. I spent a long time researching which vacuum to buy, and this is worth more than the $119 we paid for it!  Would definitely purchase again.

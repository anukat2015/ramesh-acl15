Title: Fantastic Camera for all ranging from Pros to Amateur Photographers
Content:
The K10D offers all the features any amateur photographer, even advanced, could ask for  and even appears to meet the needs of many professional photographers. It has many features that are unusual at this price range including anti-shake stabilization and self cleaning! Further since these features are in the camera body you can easily use older lens and still avail of these features. Further the camera comes with clear and easy to understand directions for the many features. The transition from my 29 year old Pentax 35mm SFX SLR was easier than I expected and I was able to use my many existing Pentax lenses. Now I have to save for the additional desirable Pentax lenses.

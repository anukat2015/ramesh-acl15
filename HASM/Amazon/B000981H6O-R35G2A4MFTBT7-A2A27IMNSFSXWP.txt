Title: Best hand held vacuum for a quick clean!
Content:
My kids know I got them with this one! Now I can handle all the crumbs that never seemed to stop falling off the dining table and finding their way to my carpet. I did my regular steam cleaning of my carpet with my bigger Hoover before the holidays and this smaller Hoover S1120 has been helping it to stay clean. It picks up ALL the crumbs even the ones on the table! The spills are not spared either. I love this baby Hoover just like I do the bigger Hoover steam cleaner.
This Hoover hand held vacuum is light weight just as I wanted it. The noise is low too, so that I can use it even when my little one has fallen asleep on her high chair, without waking her up. 
This is a great buy if you want your bigger cleaning job to last.

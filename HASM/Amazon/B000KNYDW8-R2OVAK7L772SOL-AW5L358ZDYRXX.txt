Title: Very Nice A/C
Content:
Well, I bought this a/c for my daughters room which is on the top floor of a 2 story cape style house a few months ago. It gets sooooo hot and stuffy upstairs that I decided to purchase this a/c.  I have to say this a/c works extremely well.  My daughter loves it.  This a/c replaced an extremely loud Fedders in her room which the Fedders was like having a tractor trailer motor running.  This Haiers a/c on low is extremely quiet,-- med. and high mode there is a humming sound but noise isn't bad at all.  She finally can sleep at night.  This a/c is so efficient that it also cools down the hallway just outside her room. She even turns the temp up because it does get to chilly and cold for her.  I am very happy with my purchase.

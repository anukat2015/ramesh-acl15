Title: A lot of features for a great price
Content:
THe Acer AS5740 has the most features for the lowest price I could find. CO_TCO had this on sale for $50 off with a 320GB HD, I bought one for a friend. (He paid me to get it)I liked it so much I decided to get one for myself, but the sale was over. Amazon had the Acer with a 500GB HD, and with free shipping and no tax, cost $10 less than the one at CO_TCO. The features on this are great! I don't agree with some of the other reviews about it missing things like volume controls and other dedicated keys, they are all there on mine, but I did read the owners book. All recovery disks were easy to make, and offered during the initial set up. There wasn't as much BLOAT WARE on this ACER compared with my last D_LL laptop. It was easily removed. The new MAC notebook just came out with the identical components, i5 cpu, 500GB HD, 4GB RAM, web cam, etc, for $2000! Save yourself $1400, get the ACER!

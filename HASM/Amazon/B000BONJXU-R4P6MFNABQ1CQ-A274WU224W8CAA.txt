Title: What a Blast!
Content:
I began listening within minutes of opening package. Works great with Windows Media 11- just drop and drag. Controls on device navigate well, there is even a sleep timer, graphic equalizer, and contrast adjustments for the screen. 
Sound quality seems just fine. All in all, a lot of fun for not a large price.

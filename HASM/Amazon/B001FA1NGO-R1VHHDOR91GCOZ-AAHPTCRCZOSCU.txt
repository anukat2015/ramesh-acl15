Title: Love the Nano
Content:
Got my 4th Generation iPod Nano quickly, at a lower price found at most places and it works great!  Great for running and exercising with since it is so small.  Also like the larger 16GB to hold more songs.  Now I am just waiting for Apple to put out a 64GB Touch iPod.

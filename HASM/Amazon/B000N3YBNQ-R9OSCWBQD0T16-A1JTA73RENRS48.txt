Title: Great Vacuum!
Content:
This is a really great vacuum if you want something compact. It has great suctioning power! Changing the bags is easy and it's nice that dirt and debris doesn't get all over your hands or you cleaned carpet. Although the bags are small, the vacuum lets you know when it is full. I don't have alot of closet or storage space so this vacuum is great when folded down. It's small enough to fit under a bed. My favorite part is the retractable cord. I have to vacuum almost everyday because debris shows up on my dark red carpet easily and the retractable cord keeps me from winding and winding. Overall, this is a great, well-made vacuum. Not the cheap plastic you'd expect. This is a solid vacuum despite it's size.

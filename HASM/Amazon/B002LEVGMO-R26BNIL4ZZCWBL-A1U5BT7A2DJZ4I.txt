Title: Much better than a netbook
Content:
I'm usually long winded, but I hope to just hit the highlights on this item.
Fantastic little ultra-portable!  My daughter loves it, and I try to 'borrow' it from her often.  Ultra high screen resolution (for an 11.6 inch):  Full 720P!
Now, I have a long list of 'bad' but please understand that my overall impression is that "I love it!"
CONS:  
1.)  The processor is better than an Intel Atom, but is often maxed out, especially when playing 720p movies, or running Microsoft Security Essentials (free, recommended for faster systems).
2.)  Windows VISTA pre-installed. Free upgrade to Windows 7, but it can be a hassle. TIP: Just 'upgrade' when you get your Win7 disc, or you'll miss out on the webcam software, etc.
3.)  Time is running out on the free Win7 upgrade program. Takes 3 weeks or more to get your set of discs in the mail.
4.)  Only 2 gigs of RAM.  Limited to 3 gigs on 32 bit OS's.
5.)  VISTA or the Win7 upgrade, both are 32bit, not 64bit. Limits you to 3 gigs of RAM, but may possibly improve compatibility with older hardware/software.
6.)  Pre-installed games (demos) have to be removed ONE AT A TIME.  Pain in the butt.  Other pre-installed software is minimal, easy to get rid of.
7.)  Handling the power plug while plugged in will result in a shock. I barely feel it, probably wouldn't even have noticed if my daughter had complained about how 'bad' it was. Wimp.  :)
8.)  The price is no longer Black Friday priced.  I paid 3 bills for it, now it will set you back 4 bills.

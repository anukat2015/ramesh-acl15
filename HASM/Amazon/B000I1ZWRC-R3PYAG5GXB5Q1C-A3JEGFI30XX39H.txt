Title: Great Camera
Content:
I've worked with a cannon powershot point and shoot and love this camera even better.  Yes it is more bulky cause it doesn't fit in my pocket but takes better pictures.  It is not large by any means it just doesn't fit into your pocket like a point and shoot.  You take this camera because you want to take pictures not for just incase you want to.  A friend of mine says the pictures are too clear because of the great detail in them.  We took it to Disney land and it did a wonderful job with action photos with the parade and kids running around to still shots of my kids posing.  I highly recomend this camera to anyone and it is true that once you get it you get addicted to taking pictures.  I bought a 4gb memory which held 886 pictures of the very best resolutions.

Title: iHeater
Content:
Don't waste your money on any of  the iheaters.  The product does not heat the size room promised.  Top Ten Imports has a no return policy.  If you want to try something similar look for a company that will give you a 30-60 day time to return it if your not happy.
I read on line about these type heaters before I bought one.  One site a electrician the others consumers were posting.  The electrician said they are no good but I believed those who said they were great heaters. I choose wrong.  
I had to choose a star rating to post this.  I rate the product less than 1 star

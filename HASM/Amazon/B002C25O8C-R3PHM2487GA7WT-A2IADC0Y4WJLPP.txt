Title: Acer timeline
Content:
Bought this laptop about 4 months ago, at first it worked like a charm; quiet and all. Now, the cooling system makes so much noise, i feel like it's going to explode. i know the cooling system improves the battery life, but why does it have to kill my buzz when i'm using it. my colleagues constantly laugh at the noise it makes, mostly cause i kinda got the laptop for a hell of a deal(i bragged a lot). I've been trying to get acer to finish a 3 week conversation I've been having with them; literally. they said no one else has complained about this problem, so they are looking into it.

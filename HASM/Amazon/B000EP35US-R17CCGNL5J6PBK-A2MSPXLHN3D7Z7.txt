Title: i must get this!
Content:
i really really want a ipod nano!
i've read a bunch of the reviews on this site and it sounds pretty good! 
my first mp3 player was a Creative Zen Micro. It was great... til a few weeks ago. i've only had it for less than a year and its busted. i read the reviews for the zen micro and about 5 people had the same problem. the head phone jack is broken and now the sound is horrible. but it was a good price. $199 for 5GB. the nano is 2GB for $199. a lot of people hav a problem with that but i think it's just because the nano is really thin and stylish and the zen micro is big and bulky. 
can't wait til i get one!!! they're soooo cute! but the ipod nano tubes are kinda expensive... o well. they're cute!
so if you dont know if you wana get the ipod nano or the zen micro i'd say get the nano. its a lot more stylish and way thinner. but the zen micro comes in 10 colors, which is cool. but i'd still say get the nano!!
hope this helps!

Title: It's really, a great product!
Content:
I got the iPod nano (2nd generation) as a Christmas Present. 
PROS:
*It's super sleek, and stylish
*It's pretty easy to learn how to work it
*It comes in pretty assorted colors (green, blue, pink, white, black, red)
*iTunes is pretty easy to operate
*new aluminum casing is not as breakable as plastic
*bright screen
CONS:
*Sound quality (in some songs) could be better
*The accessories could be cheaper
*It can get frozen (easy fix), but still...
*a wee bit pricey
*it could come with a manual (even though it's pretty easy to opperate...)
*you can only charge is on the computer (unless you buy a charger...)
IN A NUT SHELL
I'd suggest the nano to anyone. I think it is a good mp3 player for those of us who are less technical (ahem). *****FIVE STARS*****

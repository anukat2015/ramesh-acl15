Title: Nice MP3 player, but it has some cons
Content:
I had my ipod mini for almost a year. I got it on my 18th b-day, I have a pink one. I love my ipod mini, but it has some cons. Ipod mini is very easy to mess up, so if your a clumsy person you might want to get another mp3, another thing it freezes or cuts off every now and then and the battery life isn't all that good. I love that the ipod mini can hold a lot of music, it comes in nice colors, and has many accessories for it, you can put numbers in it, used it as a organizer, and play games on it, etc. Overall I give it 3 stars cause I just adore it and a lot of people are jealous of me cause I have one,and plus it's pink.

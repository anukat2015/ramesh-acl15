Title: IMPORTANT AND HONEST REVIEW
Content:
I owned the vac for 2.5 years so don't compare my review with people who have owned their vacs for a few months.
Vac works great for first few years, no problem.  Maybe this is how long vacs were designed to last.  So if you want a vac that will last 2-3 years and work great, this is your vac.  But after two years of normal use, which oddly is when the warranty expires, the integrity of the machine falls apart.  The power button on ours stopped working and we had to unplug cord to turn on and off.  Machine began making a funny sound.  Suction was not as powerful, even after cleaning.  The hooks that hold the cord no longer stayed straight.
I have no idea if for the price you can get a vac that lasts more than 2 years but I just bought a Bissel with a 5 year warranty, for a comperable price, if that is any indicator.  So at least comparing Bissel and Inifinity on price and warranty . . . I'd take Bissel.  I'm sure there are tons of more exspensive vacs that are better too of course.
So, DON'T BUY IT.  Oddly also, Bed Bath and Beyond seems to not be selling it anymore. . .

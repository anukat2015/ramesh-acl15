Title: Good while it lasted
Content:
The heater warmed my son's room perfectly when I purchased it earlier this year. I took it out of its box again when the fall season started (2007) and nothing happens. The only sign of life is a very dim light that comes on when I set it to anti-freeze. The light seems to get stronger when I touch the heater... how fun. Anyway, I still think DeLonghi has some innovative products, but I would stay away from this one.

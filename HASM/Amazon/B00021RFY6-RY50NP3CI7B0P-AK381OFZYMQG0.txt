Title: Best tasting coffee I've ever had!!!!!
Content:
After reading some of the reviews I had mixed feelings on this coffee maker. I am an advid coffee drinker and have had many coffee makers. This one by far is the best I've ever had. The coffee tastes so fresh, and being that it's thermal - stays warm and fresh all day. It doesn't taste stale after a few hours either like most coffee makers. Some of the reviews that I read claimed that this maker leaked - have not had any problems at all. The only down side for this maker is that you need to take the extra time to clean the grinder every morning while getting your coffee ready. But, as far as I'm concerned, if this is the only downfall for great tasting coffee - then I'm all for it.

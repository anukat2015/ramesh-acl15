Title: Never even made it to first pot before breaking!
Content:
We just received our DCM 2500 as a replacement to another B&D model (ABD500).  We had all of the overflow problems with the previous model -- seems B&D really outdid themselves with the basket and water spreader design of these particular makers.  When I called B&D about the problems (of course I already had thrown away the box) they were very kind to offer replacement.  I explained the I wanted the DCM2500 since it was rated so highly by Consumer Reports.  They agreed to ship it to me asap.  When I opened it to unwrap all of the plastic, the hinge at the top broke off and so there is now nothing to hold the entire top (including the abominable spreader) on while you are pouring the water in it.  My husband is boxing both units up shipping them back to Black & Decker with a message never to darken our doorstep again with one of their small electronic products (we have also had complaints about their irons).  We have written off the $30 lesson and will now purchase a Braun or Hamilton Beach model also rated high in the Consumer Reports rankings.

Title: Roasty-toasty, easy to use, silent
Content:
What can I say. It warms a room up almost immediately and has all the thermostat, safety, & energy saving features one could need. Best of all, it is silent, with the exception of a mild creaking noise for the first minute or so of operation. 
Looks relatively attractive as well, if a space heater could be considered attractive.

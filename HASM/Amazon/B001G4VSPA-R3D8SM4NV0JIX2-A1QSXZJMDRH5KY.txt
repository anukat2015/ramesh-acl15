Title: So far so Good !
Content:
After searching countless hours on Amazon, I believe I finally found a heater to work for my needs. Reading hundreds of product reviews and consumer reports I felt unsure how well any heater would work in my home. Having owned 3 noisy ceramic heaters and 2 inefficient coil heaters, all returns, I had all but given up staying warm and "quite" this winter. This heater so far is what I was looking for. It's large surface area really gets warm, and radiates heat outward and draws air quickly upward at a surprising rate. It's very quite, no pops or sparks found in other plate heater reviews. It has a thermostat that is pretty accurate. & The greatest part of the heater, it's quite. The heater is silent, without a fan it uses all of it's energy to provide heat. I considered radiant heaters, oil filled radiators, "ultra quiet" ceramics, and Mica panels, after a trade off comparison this heater is a clear winner.

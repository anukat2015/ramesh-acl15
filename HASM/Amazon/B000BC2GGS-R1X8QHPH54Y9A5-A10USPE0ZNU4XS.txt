Title: Good heater, awkward design
Content:
I bought this heater for a spare bedroom. The quiet, and ability to set the thermostat to an exact temperature was a big selling point for me. This unit does a good job of taking the chill out of the air. However, don't expect it to quickly blow out volumes of hot air and heat an entire room within two-minutes.  I like the fact that it is completely quiet, and doesn't off-gas any strange smells (like the Delonghi Mica Panel Radiator). However, since it is a baseboard design, you have to get down on the floor with a flashlight to see and adjust the display, which has no light. A remote control would be a good improvement. Although this unit is very lightweight and has a low, long profile, it is still fairly large and doesn't exactly disappear, if you get my drift. Overall, I am pleased with the job it does.

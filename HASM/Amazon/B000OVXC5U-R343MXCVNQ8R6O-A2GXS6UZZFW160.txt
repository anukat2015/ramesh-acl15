Title: Best thing you could buy!
Content:
I would have to say that this is a very heavy vacuum. It does weight about ten to fifteen pounds. "BUT" what this vacuum does, is worth the weight. I have alergies and this is a life saver. I couldn't seem to get rid of dust or pet dander, but when I use this vacuum it takes what was in the air and puts it into water. The suction is amazing. I see things in the water that I didn't even know was there. It really does the work for a DEEP clean. Yes it isn't something you use when you are doing daily cleaning, but when it comes to needing to get things clean this vacuum does the job. The best.

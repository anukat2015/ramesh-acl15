Title: Works great for us!
Content:
I've been using this in my upstairs bedroom for the past couple weeks. My home was build in 1951 and there is little to no insulation in the walls and crawlspace. We turn the force air heat down to 60 at night and the unit has no trouble at all keeping the room at 72 degrees overnight. 
The only negatives I've read about are a plastic burning smell and a hot power cord; I have not experienced either issue. I'm very happy with this heater and love that it has a thermostat.

Title: Excellent camera for a bargain price
Content:
The D40 is a great way to step up from a point-and-shoot camera to a DSLR, whether you want to expand your creative possibilities, experience excellent image quality in a wide range of lighting, take pictures of action without the annoying shutter lag, pose as a professional photographer, or all of the above. 
First, I like the light weight of the camera. It allows me to easily carry it around wherever I go, along with a few compact lenses, always ready to capture the moment as it happens. That's a huge image quality advantage over an expensive camera and a bag-full of exotic lenses that you left at home because it was too heavy to drag around.
Secondly, this camera has plenty of smart features which enable less fiddling around with the settings and allow me to focus on taking the picture. Some examples I like are:
* Customizable ISO-Auto function allows me to set the maximum ISO and minimum shutter speed I want, thereby eliminating the need to manually adjust ISO for different lighting conditions.
* After a picture is taken, it automatically gets displayed on the LCD for review, making adjustments, or deleting, without having to manually switch to playback mode.
* A customizable Menu for easy, fast access to features I use often without digging thorough every available item. I can leave the critical adjustments like white balance and picture presets, while hiding those I use once and forget, like date/time, language, etc.
* RGB histogram in playback mode lets me gauge if I need to adjust the color balance or if a certain color channel is clipping. Much more useful than a single-channel histogram.
Some other notable advantages, compared to the competition:
* The AF-assist lamp facilitates low light focusing. On cameras without the lamp, you'd have to use the annoying flash strobe.
* 1/500s x-sync means I can use the flash with shutter speeds up to 1/500s, effective for freezing motion or using the flash to balance out the shadows in harsh sunlight. Other cameras in this class usually only go to 1/200s.
The 6MP resolution is plenty for making great-looking 8x12 prints, and puts less space-clogging pixels on the memory card. Image quality is very good from ISO 200 - 1600, and I regularly use ISO 1600 in low light with great results. Included kit lens is sharp all around, and is perfectly adequate for making great-looking photos. Ergonomics of the camera are outstanding for its small size - it fits in my hand comfortably and doesn't make my fingers feel cramped.
There are, however, some limitations about this camera which may or may not be a big deal, depending on how you use it, such as:
* It lacks an autofocus motor in the camera body, meaning autofocus only works with AF-S lenses - those with an internal focus motor. Not necessarily a problem since all the newer Nikon lenses are AF-S, but Nikon also has a number of great, inexpensive, older AF lenses, and on the D40 these will be manual focus only.
* The built in flash cannot be used as a master to control additional wireless flash units. You'd need to buy a wireless flash controller for that.
* With only 3 AF points, you have to focus and recompose before taking the picture if your subject is outside these 3 points. Not a problem for me since I do this naturally, but something to keep in mind if you're used to a point-and-shoot camera.
* There are no buttons for directly changing white balance, image size/quality and ISO. There is, however, a customizable Fn button which I assigned to adjust white balance, and with ISO-Auto activated, I rarely miss having these buttons.
* 2.5 fps continuous shooting is too slow for getting multiple shots of fast-paced sports or other action. If you're not shooting those kind of scenes often, then it's not a problem.
Overall, this is an easy to use, well-designed camera which offers superb image quality at a relatively low price, and with plenty of features that make it easier to get great shots, instead of getting in your way. Seasoned photographers who need the AF compatibility with older lenses or are shooting fast-paced action should consider the higher end camera models, but for a casual hobbyist or enthusiast, the Nikon D40 is as a highly recommended camera.

Title: Loving it
Content:
Bought this on Thanksgiving for $299 (was one of the lucky few I suppose) and it's worth every penny. I've got a 2.5 year old Acer Extensa 14.1" and was planning on using the Aspire One as a "backup," but the Extensa has been used sparingly since this machine came. After removing the Bloatware, upgrading from Vista to Win7 and installing Office, this is a great machine. It's not a high-powered laptop or anything like that, but serves my purposes fine. The HDMI out port is a great feature, as I've been able to hook the laptop up to my 52" tv and watch downloaded movies with little to no problem. I was concerned about the keyboard as I'm used to larger, but it hasn't been an issue at all, aside from the occasional typo. The portability is outstanding as well. 
All in all, I'm thrilled and have recommended the AS1410 to a number of friends.

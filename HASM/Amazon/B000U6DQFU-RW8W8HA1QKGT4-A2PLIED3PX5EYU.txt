Title: my carpeted stairs thank you
Content:
living in a small city apartment with a cat and carpeted stairs, one would hope i'd have on of those fancy vacuums with the detachable bit for the stairs. . or at least a crevice tool.  alas, i'm 20 something with the hoover from the 70's i inherited when i moved out on my own. a petite gal like me cannot lug the vac up and down the stairs, nor afford a new one.  This little hand held fit the bill.  When kept plugged in and at the ready, it's got enough power to do the whole flight, and its nozzle is small enough to fit between the banister rails!  I've had mine for about a year now, and find myself reaching for it often.  The clunky awkward upright i have  can't get within 2 inches of the wall, so this little gem works perfectly to make up for it.
The filter runs about $8 on Amazon.  Whenever i see it's loosing suction, i empty the dust cup,  pull the cat fur off the filter, and reassemble.  Ready to go.  The filter is paper and not designed for this, but i had a lot of success rinsing it out, letting it dry and using it again.
Fits the bill for me.
It would have gotten the last star if i didn't have to stop every once in a while and unclog the flap in the nozzle that seems to love a good cat hairball.  Or if the battery let me do multiple rooms at once, but i think that's a lot to ask from a hand vac.

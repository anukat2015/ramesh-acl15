Title: Thrilled
Content:
I am THRILLED with my new purchase, Yes it may only be a coffee maker but if you have every had a bad one I am sure you can relate. Not only does this one look good ( I love the red) It is easy to use and I told my husband having the "coffee fariy" every morning and having the coffee ready is a great thing. It is also a plus that the carafe does not dribble and drip all over the counter.

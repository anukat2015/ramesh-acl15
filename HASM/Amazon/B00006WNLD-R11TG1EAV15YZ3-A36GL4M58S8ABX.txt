Title: Product does not work
Content:
This one cup coffemaker from Black & Decker did not work properly the
first time, I used it.  Instead of waiting until you pushed the button down to turn it on, it just started brewing on its own.  So I had to pour in the water, put in the coffee and make sure I had the mug underneath the opening before I plugged it in or the water would come pouring out of it.  My mother bought one of these brewers too, and it did the exact same thing mine did.  I have had other brands of these one cuppers over the years, and none of them did what this one did. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

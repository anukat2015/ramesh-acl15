Title: DeLonghi heater review
Content:
This is a great little heater for keeping your feet warm. It isn't big enouugh to warm a room but it keeps the chill off. It tends to blow cold air if left on too long but that seems to be remedied by turning up the dial a little. The case never seems to get hot so I don't worry about it burning the carpet on the floor. Its a good little heater for a great price.

Title: Not Recommended (POS)
Content:
First review I gave it 4 stars
Second review of this thing after using it for a while 2 stars. 
I grant good sound quality, and it looks nice.
BUT
It is not a well made unit.
First failure for me came after about 9 months of light use. It just stopped playing. Turns out the hard drive froze up. I did some drilling, and it seemed to be a common problem with the Seagate harddrive Creative was using (on the early models?) A LOT of people had it.
Now the on/off switch doesnt work.
The only way to use it is to yank the battery to turn it off, and plug it into the charging adapter or dock port to turn it on.
Tech support wants $25 each time it looks at it, even if its still within the one year warranty. So Im up to $300 for a shoddy player which will no doubt fail again.
Take these reviews to heart, dear reader. You will see that bad ones are quite common. Save yourself time, money, and aggrevation.
Get something else.

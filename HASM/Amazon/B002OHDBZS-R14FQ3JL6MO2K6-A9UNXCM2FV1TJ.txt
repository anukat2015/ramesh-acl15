Title: love the k-7
Content:
recently purchased the k-7 and absolutely love it. i have owned the nikon d90 as well and for me there is no comparison. the k-7 feels more solid (better built). its more compact which for me was a plus. it was a win win for me. the 18-55 lens it came with is crisp. its everything it claims to be. very happy with this purchase.

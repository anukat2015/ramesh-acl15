Title: Bad focus at Av and Tv mode
Content:
I owned this camera for more than one year, it can't do a good focus at Av or Tv mode, I have to shot almost all my pictures at P mode (it has good focus at P mode). Even I use the same Aperture give by P mode to shot the same picture in Av mode, it still can't give me a clear picture. Very disappointing.

I got an iPod touch from Santa for Christmas and I love it! I'll never be able to fill it up with music but that's OK. One thing I love is the apps.Oh my goodness.They are incredible. I have 3 games,the Facebook app and the Urbanspoon(restaraunt) app and they're great. It's so easy to get online with my iPod and download music anyplace that has free wifi.
The iPod looks great,too.I get so many comments about it.

Title: A Mighty Vacuum!
Content:
I bought this as replacement for our 10 year old original Mighty. My husband refused to throw it out even tho it had no wheels, the hose was entirely duct taped, the handle was screwed into the hose and clamped, and you had to talk softly to it to get it to turn on...It was pitiful to see but it still worked and had massive power. I have replaced it with  at least 6 different vacuums and each would end up in the closet and he would bring the broken down Mighty from the garage to my dismay. While shopping online I saw the Mighty Max Pet Lover, I did not know the company still made it. Anyway, I decided on the Pet Lover since we have lots of pets and it has a lot more power for just a little more money! My husband was so excited you would have thought I gave him the winning lottery ticket. (I have a husband that likes to vacuum, however that's all the housework he does but I ain't complaining) Well, it lives up to it's reputation and we can't be happier. The furniture attachment for pet hair is awesome. You can't go wrong buying this little gem.....Oh, the other one? He still wouldn't throw it away, it's now the official garage vacuum......

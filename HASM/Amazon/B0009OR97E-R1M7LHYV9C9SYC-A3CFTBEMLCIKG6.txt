Title: I actually enjoy vacuuming now!
Content:
Love this vacuum.  It is the closest I could find to my old 1970's electrolux canister vacuum in appearance and durability, but this one performs better.  We needed a HEPA vac due to allergies, and I was under-whelmed by all the ugly imported plastic vacuums I looked at.   I was so happy to find this one, and I have been nothing but pleased with this machine.   I feel like when I clean, the house is truly clean now.  I love that it is beautiful, heavy duty, and made in USA. The high and low speed toggle switch is a nice touch.   Glad I got the electric power nozzle. I have had it for almost six months and everything about this vacuum still feels like quality to me. If you are put off by the price, remember: quality  IS economy!

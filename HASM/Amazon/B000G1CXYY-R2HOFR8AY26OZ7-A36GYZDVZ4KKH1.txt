Title: Good little heater; energy efficient mode not that great.
Content:
This is a decent little heater, although I used one from Holmes that was better.  Bought this thing because of the 875w energy saving mode, which is not that warm, but that was expected.  I usually end up turning it up to the 1500W mode (gets very hot) for noticeable warmth in a cold tile bathroom or under my desk.  I also figured out that I like oscillating heaters better.

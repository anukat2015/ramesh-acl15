Title: Fantastic camera!! BUY THIS CAMERA!
Content:
I can not say enough good things about this camera.  From the stylish and durable construction of the camera to the quality of images this thing has really exceeded my expectations.  I have owned this camera for over 8 months now and have taken it everywhere, trips overseas, weddings, family outings, dinner parties, birthday parties, you name it.  It has produced stellar photos at every occasion and as you can tell by the different number of events I've been to the versatility of the camera is extremely impressive.  You can quickly switch between taking photos of food, portraits, other macro shots, running water or fast action sports shots, they all turn out amazingly well.  If you are going on a trip (I went to Greece and wanted to capture every moment perfectly) do not be cheap, I beg you, you will regret it.  The one and only downside to this camera, which is perhaps a downside for all current generation dslrs is the size.  It doesn't bother me at all because I know at the end of the day I will capture the most memorable shots.  If you made it to the end of this review I have only one piece of advice for you: BUY THIS CAMERA!!!  Actually, I have two, consider buying a lens with a little bit of zoom, the lens supplied with the kit gives you little to no zoom.

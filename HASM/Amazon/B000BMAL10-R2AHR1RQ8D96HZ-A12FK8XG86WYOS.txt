Title: Just Buy It- It's worth it
Content:
Considering the price, I was hesitant about buying th Nano. But Now that I have the ipod nano, its worth it. 
Don't believe the lies that ipod nanos scratch easily and is not durable. Only morons scratch their ipods. It's been 3 months and I have not scratched my nano. I have dropped it several times and I have lied on it while I was sleeping (thousands of times). Buy a nice silicon, aluminum, or leather case and you're be fine. A good case will absorb the shock of dropping. Leave the plastic sticker on and your screen will be protected from scratches and other things. 
When you first take the ipod out of the box, be careful. First and foremost, get a case and everything will be swell. 
Ipod provide spectacular sounds and multiple useful features (games, calendar, stop watch, contacts, notes, clock: worldwide, shuffle, photos, and etc.). I really enjoy the "on-the-go" playlist option. The "on-the go" playlist allows you to make a playlist on the ipod. 
The things I hate about the ipod are the short battery life and the headphones. The good thing is that these things can be easily fixed. Buy a car charger and home charger on ebay and a cheap high performing sony headphones at walmart and everything is good. 
The ipod is enjoyable and itunes is really user-friendly.

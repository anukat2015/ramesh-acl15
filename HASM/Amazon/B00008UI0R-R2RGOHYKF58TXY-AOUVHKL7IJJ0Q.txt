Title: Wind Tunnel runs out of wind...
Content:
The first one we received had a defective power beater (would not turn) and the replacement we received would not turn off unless we pulled the plug from the outlet.  Also, it intermittently would not turn on.  I would not waste my time nor my money on this vacuum.

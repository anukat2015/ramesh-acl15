Title: Does the job for small house with hardwoods
Content:
I like this vacuum. We have all hardwood floors with rugs. It does a fantastic job on carpet and a pretty good job on bare floor too. We have an inside dog, and it does better getting up hair than anything I've had. I usually have problems using a vacuum to get up fine dirt from bare floor. This one is the same way, so I sweep and use the hose to vacuum it up. The vacuum is light and easy to store in our small house. There are very few things I don't like. The attachment holder on the wand prevents my being able to vacuum under our bed, and the attachments don't stay on anyway. The wand is top heavy, and it is difficult to get it to stand up by itself. Those are minimal though, so I'm glad I got this one. I think it's a great vacuum for the price.

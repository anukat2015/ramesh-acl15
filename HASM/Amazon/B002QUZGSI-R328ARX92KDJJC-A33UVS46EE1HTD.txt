Title: More than worth the money!
Content:
As much as I would have loved to have a high-end SLR, I just wasn't looking to spend that much money.  I'd rather use the extra money for lenses.  The K-x had gotten good reviews and was still twice the megapixels of my present camera.  I love how light weight it is!  When using high ISO (3200 & 6400) the noise is not bad, still there, but not too bad.  It cleans up nicely w/ noise reduction software.  The size of it works well for me and how I hold the camera, whether horizontal or vertical.

Title: Keurig B-60 is the best
Content:
I have had many coffee makers in my life and being over 50, that's a lot.  The Keurig B60 is the best I have ever had.  I love the convenience of having a cup of coffee when I want it and the K-cup variety is fantastic.  My wife is picky on her flavors and I have my favorites as well.  Before, we would have to brew a small pot of hers, store in another caraf and make mine.  Guess who ended making both pots?  Then the waste of the left over coffee!!  No more waste now.
The B60 provides 3 different portion sizes but if you want a BIG cup of coffee, we brew to the largest setting and then brew the same k-cup again on medium and small.  That seems to do the trick.
For those who want a quick cup, a great cup of coffee, this is the one for you.

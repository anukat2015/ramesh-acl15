Title: Excellent value
Content:
We had a Kenmore bagless it did a decent job but the filters clogg after one use so you are continuously cleaning the filter. The kenmore would also old odor in the filter. The Infinity has great suction power and does not have a filter to get clogged. Very easy to emtpy and does not hold on to any odor. We shopped the Infinity vs. the Dyson and decided for the price difference to get the Infinity. No regrets.

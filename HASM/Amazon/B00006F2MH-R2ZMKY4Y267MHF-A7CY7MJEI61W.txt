Title: Love this Coffee Maker!
Content:
I received this as a gift and after reading the reviews, I was worried about it. The first couple of times I used it, I had similar problems: it made weak coffee, seemed to take more beans than it should for a regular pot for one person (6 cups water from carafe=2 large mugs). However, I have found out that it was operator error. When it made a weak cup, I was tying to use my old scoop as a measure, not the one in the box. If I use 6 scoops of coffee with 6 cups from the carafe, it makes a nice strong cup of coffee. I had forgotten the first few times to include the cap to the filter basket--that made the coffee weak. This pot is EASY to clean. All I do is pull out the top grinder mechanism, rinse and set on a paper towel. It gets steamy inside, so it is also a good idea to prop the top of open to completely dry before grinding again. This isn't the "full" cleaning it calls for, but it is enough to make another pot of great coffee the next morning. About once a week all the easy-to-remove parts go in the dishwasher and viola! Ready for another week! The grinder is loud, but by programming it for when I should be up in the morning, it makes a bonus for actually getting out of bed--a freshly brewed pot of coffee. All in all, this is a wonderful coffee maker and I am most grateful to have it.

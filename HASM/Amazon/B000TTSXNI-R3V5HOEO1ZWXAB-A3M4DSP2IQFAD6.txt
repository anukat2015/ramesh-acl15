Title: I got allergy from it
Content:
I got this last year ceramic tower from lasko. 
My room was cold and I turned it quite long time usually for sleeping.
It made the room warmer easily. But then I got allergy after the winter. I usually didn't have pollen or dust allergy. But for some reason, I had terrible running nose and sneeze a lot!! 
But then over the summer, I was better. and now this winter I turned the heater again, and it made me running nose and sneeze AGAIN! I got the cold medicine or allergy one.. doesn't work very well...
I suspected it might be from the heater. I take a good look at the heater. And I saw some of dust got stuck in the vent and I think it is got burned by heat and some of dust ash gets fly all over my place and stuck my nose..
I changed to convection hallogen light style heater. Now I don't sneeze at all and my nose feel much much better. 
I guess if you use this heater for short term usage, it might be all right. But if you need to turn the heater on quite long time. It might affect your allergy or irritate your nose or throut. 
You don't really know until you use this quite long enough. 
I wonder if there are some people had similar experience..

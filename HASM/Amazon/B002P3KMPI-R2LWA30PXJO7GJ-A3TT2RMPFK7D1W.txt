Title: Screen sucks
Content:
I should have listened to those who complained about the screen & the fact it has a very narrow sweet spot for viewing. 
ASUS really dropped the ball on this & I ended up paying for it.  It is surprising to me that it got into production this way.  Somebody in the company should have said: Stop! and fix it.

Title: Does what it is suposed to - and quietly too.
Content:
I've owned this product for nearly a year and was compelled to write this review when I picked up a second space heater (Bionaire tower) with similar features but which was rediculously loud.  I use this heater in my son's room and on my RV to supliment the furnaces and it does a great job heating.  Surface area of the blower is quite large and the heat nicely distributed accross it which keeps the blower noise down and the grill relitavely cool.  Marked it down from 5 stars due to the thermometer running a degree or two  too high (yes I am picky)

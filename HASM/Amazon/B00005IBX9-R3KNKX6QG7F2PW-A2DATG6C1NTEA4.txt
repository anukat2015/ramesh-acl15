Title: Let me know what you think in a year or so...
Content:
We loved our coffee maker...atleast until we had it a year or so.  What was once a terrific coffee maker now makes bitter coffee no matter what we do. We've replaced the charcoal filter twice, cleaned the maker several times, switched coffees, etc. and nothing worked. Still tasted bitter.  
Now, to add to all that, the automatic timer no longer works. We set it for the correct time, etc. but it shuts itself off.  
My advice: look around before deciding on this one. It's also not made very well, despite it's looks.

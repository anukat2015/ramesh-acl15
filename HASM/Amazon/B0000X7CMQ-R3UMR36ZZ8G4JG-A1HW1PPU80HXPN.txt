Title: Perfection
Content:
This product is easy to use, it looks stylish, and the coffee stays warm from the time it's brewed (8am) until late in the afternoon. This is a huge benefit for my lifestyle. Yes, the cap is sometimes hard to get off but ONLY when screwed on too tight. Otherwise, no complaints. *easy to clean.

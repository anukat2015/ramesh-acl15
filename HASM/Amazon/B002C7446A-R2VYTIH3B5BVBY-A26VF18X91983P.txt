Title: Really, really glitzy computer!
Content:
I just ventured back into Apple country after many years of being with PC desktops and notebooks. I debated with myself a long time about buying a Mac. I was always wow-ed by the PC specs and features and had questions about the Macs matching up. "Eh, what's the difference?" I thought. BIG difference. But, at least I debated with myself until this great Mac Book Pro came out. My ambivalence was a good thing after all.
This machine - despite being the base model - is very fast. Downloads are much easier than with Windows. Internet is much faster than on a Windows machine. The DVD drive is very speedy. Overall, I would have to say that the machine seems more "intelligent" than a PC. It summons your information without much effort at all. Beautiful graphics. Great sound. Lighted keyboard. Multitouch trackpad. Superb battery life. Quite a package for the price. That's why I went ahead and grabbed one. I'm glad I did. Honestly, this is more than a computer. It is truly an experience! No need to hesitate at this point. Now is a great time to get one. Buying the machine now allows you to upgrade to Snow Leopard OS when it arrives in September for $10. That means an even faster and leaner machine than it is already. Wow:)!
Get one. You'll be happy you did.

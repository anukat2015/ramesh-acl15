Title: Hoover WindTunnel Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
I purchased this vacuum to use on laminate, tile and cement floors so I have not been using the carpet attachment much.  I like this vacuum.  I like the convenient telescoping wand, and the fact that you have 3 different levels of suction that you can choose among.  The one thing I miss is a long bristled round attachment for dusting ledges, etc.  The shorter bristled combo furniture attachment just doesn't work as well, in my opinion.  The retracting cord is nice, the vacuum is not too heavy to carry from place to place, self storage of the smaller attachments is convenient, and being able to clean the filters is a plus.  I would not hesitate to recommend this vacuum for persons using it on hard floors, I cannot speak to its performance on carpet.

Title: Worthless battery life
Content:
I have just one thing to say about my Toshiba Satellite, and I presume this extends to all of Toshiba's laptops: the battery is worthless. It never lasted more than an hour and a half when I got it new and quickly deteriorated until now when it barely lasts 15 minutes. I know laptop batteries wear out, but I've also used IBM laptops at work for many years and those batteries always last for several hours even when they are old (as many as 4 hours!). So if you care about battery life, don't get Toshiba.

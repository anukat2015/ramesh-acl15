Title: I love it!
Content:
I recently purchased the Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB Nano. So far, I have been very pleased. I have a neuromuscular disorder and I am able to grasp this player more easily than my friend's I-Pod. I am able to use the joystick with no problems as well. The software is easy to install and work with. It is easy to recharge and the battery life is excellent. I have been pleased with the sound quality. And, it is just plain "cute." 
A few minor "cons." Screen is hard to see in bright sunlight and the smooth exterior sometimes gets a "smudged look."
An excellent buy for the money and I would purchase this product again.

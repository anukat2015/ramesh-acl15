Title: Excellent product-the only thing missing is the phone!
Content:
The ipod touch was the perfect solution for me when I'm stuck "waiting" somewhere with nothing to do. I can jump on and check my email, play one of the applications (available to download for free or a small fee), watch music videos or listen to music. (I even downloaded a recipe application to help out in the kitchen-sure beats paging through a thick recipe book). Even though I mostly use the headphones, I like that the 2nd gen has a speaker so you can listen with or without. The only thing missing is the phone!

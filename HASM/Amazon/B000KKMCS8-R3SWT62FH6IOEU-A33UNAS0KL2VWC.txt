Title: Do not buy this heater or any other Pelonis product
Content:
Do not buy this heater or any Pelonis product. I bought this heater two months ago. I turned this heater on and it burned my linoleum floor. I tried calling the number on their web site and it just rings and rings. I sent an email to them and I have not received a response.
I bought the same model twenty years ago and was extremely happy with it. Comparing it with the new model there is no comparison. The new one is built really cheap and flimsy. The are lots of plastic parts with the new one. My old was made in the USA while the new one now made in China.

Title: Halogen Heater Comfort Zone CZHTV9
Content:
We have had Halogen heaters before and like the heat they put out.  This one does a nice job, burt we have recently noticed that if it stays on for long periods of time there must be a overheat switch on it, because it will cut itself off.  We wait a little bit of time, unplug it, then plug it back in, and it goes again just like normal.  Overall we like it.

Title: Great heater, annoying ticking noise
Content:
This heater looks great and gives out a lot of heat if you are sitting/standing right next to it. It really works for the purpose I had for it. But, in order for it to be turned on you have to turn on the timer (the dial on the right) which makes this annoying ticking sound. I have a low tolerance for sounds like that, so I got my wire-knowledgeable friend to unscrew the bottom of the heater and do bypass surgery on it--it was a pretty simple fix if you know about that sort of thing and now I don't have to listen to the timer. The timer is a safety feature, but the heater turns itself off if it leaves the level position, so it's already very safe.

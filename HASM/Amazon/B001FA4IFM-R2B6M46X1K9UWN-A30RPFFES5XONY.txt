Title: Good
Content:
I bought this heater to heat up my bedroom. Its great. It warms up my room very quick and keeps it warm. Its also small and compact and quiet so you can place it anywhere in the room and it won't keep you awake at night. The thermostat setting could be better and it does shut off after hitting 70 but it keeps the room warm. It works well for me.

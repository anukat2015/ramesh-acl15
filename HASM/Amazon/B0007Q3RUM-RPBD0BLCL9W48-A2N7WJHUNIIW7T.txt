Title: Chill Chaser
Content:
We purchased this item as a chill chaser so we would not have to light our wall heater untill we had to. The temperature here is up and down, 40 one day and 75 the next. It works good for the large area we have it in, a front room - dining room area.  Its a little pricey but so far so good.  We have used it about a month.

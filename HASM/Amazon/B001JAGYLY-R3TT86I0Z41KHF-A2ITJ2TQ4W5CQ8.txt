Title: great so far
Content:
i don't usually like rating products so soon after purchase, but more reviews are needed on this product.
so far this unit works great. it's nice knowing how much dust this unit picks up because when you empty it you can see it. the power nozzle works great it seems to get deep into the carpet and makes it feel more plush after vacuuming. mine came with an attachment for hard surfaces and it also works quite well although it's very basic.
my wife says it's fun to use and much quieter than our old vac. she likes the long cord that retracts and she says it's easy to vacuum under beds and furniture compared to a non canister type vac.
as long as the unit holds up i would definitely recommend this vacuum.

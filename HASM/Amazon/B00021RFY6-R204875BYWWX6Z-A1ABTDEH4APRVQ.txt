Title: So Far So Good
Content:
I had read all the reviews on this coffee maker and decided not to buy it.Then I was at a department store and they had this unit on display New for $179.00 I looked it all over and decided I liked the way it was built so I ordered one from Amazon. I love the machine so far I did read the Manual front to back before I even pluged it in. The grinder is loud when it grinds but this would do that on any grinder, It also has about 7 pieces to clean and dry each time but it really doesnt take that long.

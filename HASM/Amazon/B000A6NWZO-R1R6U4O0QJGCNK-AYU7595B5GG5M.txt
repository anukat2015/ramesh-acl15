Title: Almost but not quite
Content:
I bought this model after exhaustive research. This dual hose system does indeed cool quite well but there are some caveats. You must wrap the exhaust hose in a thermal insulator or else the radiant heat from that hose will partially negate the cooling effect. You must also spend the extra money for a hose extension since 4 ft. is not long enough to locate the unit more than a couple of feet from the window. The biggest complaint I have about this unit is the noise and vibration. This thing is loud! I had to buy expensive sound and vibration absorbing padding to put on the floor underneath the unit or else the floors and walls vibrated so much that my wife could not sleep downstairs! I would suggest that you check out the Sharp models that have special quiet technology if this noise and vibration would be a problem for you. The manufacturer of this air conditioner touts the efficiency of the rotary compressor but fails to warn you against the fillings vibrating out of your mouth. And I ride a Harley! I know vibrations! I have to really crank up the iTunes in my office to drown out the sound of this thing. While I would never put this unit in a bedroom, my office is quite comfortable and I don't feel it was a total loss. If I ever buy another one though, you can be sure I will look for the "quiet" alternative, even at the expense of the cooling capability.

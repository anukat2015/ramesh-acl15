Title: Good So Far
Content:
I got my new iPod the other day, so far its great.
I read a review that commented on the cover flow, when you turn it sideways it goes it cover flow.  I actually love this feature, I get to my music mostly by the cover flow feature.  I can see where this might not appeal to some people.
Another thing I can see people complaining about is the shuffle to a different song when you shake it feature.  This is something I personally love, I forget I have some songs and I shuffle it and it's like "oh yeah, I love this song!" but I think for some people it might shuffle unexpectedly.  I personally wouldn't mind if it randomly did that.  To me it is a great feature.
Another thing thats new is the Genius feature, when your listening to your iPod you can hold the center button down and it will show you songs that would go great with the one your listening to, of course the ones it shows you are in your iPod.
I used to have the 3rd Generation iPod and I think this iPod has alot of the same things we've come to associate with iPods but also alot of new fun things, like how it knows how you move it and the Genius feature.

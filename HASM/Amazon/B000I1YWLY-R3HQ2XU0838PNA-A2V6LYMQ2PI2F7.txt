Title: Avoid this vacuum.
Content:
I have one of these and it worked one time and never turned back on again. There seems to be a design flaw on this unit. The vacuum would not power on and was taking up space, so I trashed it. I shopped around for a few days and found an oreck commercial upright for about $199, and bought it. I'm happy and my carpet is clean.

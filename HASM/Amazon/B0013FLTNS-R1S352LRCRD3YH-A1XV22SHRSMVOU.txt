Title: Bought a MacBook Pro from Amazon
Content:
The MacBook Pro arrived quickly and I was pleased that it was exactly as advertised.  I did have a problem with the laptop crashing 2 times in a 3 week period, so I took it into Mac Authority (apple store/service) and they replaced a faulty hard drive, free of charge.  This was, in no way, the fault of Amazon, it appeared to be a manufacturing problem, but it was taken care of by the Apple people.  I have my Mac back now and absolutely love it!

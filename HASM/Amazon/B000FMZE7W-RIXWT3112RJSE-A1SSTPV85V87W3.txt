Title: So far, so good
Content:
I've only had my Zune for about a week now. So I'm not going to comment on reliablity or durability. Formerly I owned a 30gig Ipod and the quality was so poor that it had to be returned to Apple twice. The third time it broke it was no longer under warranty so it was time to buy something different. 
As far as sound quality goes. The Zune sounds really good. It is very clear and crisp. The display is crystal clear, and quite large as well. The Zune software was very easy to use. In fact I had it fully set up with my computers entire library of songs synced to my Zune in less than 30 mins. The user interface is very simple to use everything is well laid out and easy to find. Accessories, like the iPods are a rip off. I guess we can't have everything. 
As for the Zune marketplace. I've seen a lot of people complaining that you have to buy the microsoft points in order to purchase  songs from the Zune Marketplace. I tried the marketplace for the first time and it really wasn't that big of deal to have to buy points. It took  only took a minute. You can purchase 400 points for $5.00, 1200 points for $15.00, 2000 points for $25.00 or 4000 points for 50 dollars. The price of an individual song goes for 79 points. The price to download an entire album varied greatly from between 500 to 1200 points which I would assume is based on how popular and/or long an album is. As for the Zune pass. A pass costs either 14.99 for one month or 44.97 for 3 months. This allows you to download as many songs as you want from the Zune marketplace. Which is a really cool feature. The only downside is that the downloads are only yours for as long as you keep the subscription active.
The only thing I can't comment on yet is reliablity. I haven't had my Zune long enough to say. I will update this review if any problems arise. So far I'd have to say that I'm very happy with my Zune.
Update 11/2008 Thus far the reliability of my Zune has been excellent. After having it for a year and a half I haven't had any problems and the battery still holds its charge well. The updates to the Zune software have been excellent. With every update it seems to get better. Although I have heard some people say they had issues with some of the updates. I have yet to see any problems with them.

Title: A nice little heater
Content:
This is  a nice, cheap, little heater.  Works well, fairly quiet, and it does have a off position on the switch, unlike some others.
It does not have a tip-over switch, unlike most heaters of this type, which I don't think is  a disadvantage. 
A shame that it is made in China, like almost everything these days.

Title: Better than iPod Video in terms of both features and price!
Content:
Pros:
- Sleek design. Very small. Same dimensions as iPod Video, though thicker.
- Beautiful screen, brilliant colors (more colors than iPod Video).
- You can customize wallpapers.
- Support for several video formats, including DivX.
- You can use WMP10/11 with it just fine so you don't need to install Creative Software everytime you connect to a PC (this was an issue with older Zen models).
- Shortcut button comes in quite handy.
- Better navigation than older Zen models.
- Built-in EQ, Smart Volume, and Bass Boost features.
Cons:
- Sleek front is a magnet for fingerprints and scratches.
- Touchpad seems sensitive even on "low sensitivity" setting.
- Slow loading of videos/photographs at times.
- Mine didn't come with wall charger (charging by USB takes 5-6 hours!). My friend owns an older one and his DID come with a wall charger. Go figure...
- Carrying pouch doesn't do the product justice. It's unfortunate since the older Zen Xtra model came with a free leather case.
- All the charging/transferring/TV-output is handled through a little dongle, which is small enough to easily lose.
- Battery is not replaceable (erm, not replaceable without voiding your warranty)
- Useless manual (however, gadget-savvy people will figure out this device right away).

Title: Endless clogging
Content:
I bought this vacuum when I used to live with a roommate with a dog.  This vacuum got clogged at least once per cleaning of the apartment.  The hose gets clogged most often.  The plastic circular filter just above the dirt canister got clogged quite often too.  Lastly, though not as often, the hose just above the rotating carpet cleaner on the bottom got clogged.  
I now live in a new apartment with a short carpet and no pet.  The vacuum now only gets clogged half as often, however it still a pain.  
I use this vacuum only because I don't want to pay for another one.  But it looks like i'll have no choice because today i noticed smoke originating below the dirt canister where I believe the motor is located.

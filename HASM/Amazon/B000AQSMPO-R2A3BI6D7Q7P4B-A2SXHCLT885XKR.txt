Title: Best In Class
Content:
After more than 30 years of drinking coffee with various home coffee makers, I found the Kuerig coffee maker. By far this is the best coffee maker I have ever used. We have one at home and another at the office. After about a year the office machine started have a few issues (the home unit has worked flawlessly for over 2 years) and I called Kuerig customer service to see what could be done. After talking to a tech for a few minutes, they offered to send me a new machine at no cost. Not only do I rate their coffee maker 5 stars, their service rates 5 stars, too. I'm sure I will be a customer for life.

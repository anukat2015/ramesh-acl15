Title: Worth every penny...
Content:
I was sick and tired of vacuuming and dusting, only to find a film of dust on the furniture in a couple of days.  So, I threw out the (relatively new) upright and went for the Miele.  It is absolutely worth every penny.  There is nothing better for hard-wood floors (goodbye broom and Swifter), short pile and deep pile rugs, and wall-to-wall carpet.  The quality of the vacuum is very evident, and it is a joy to use.  My home is noticeably less dusty, even when I fall a few days behind on my cleaning chores.  Go ahead and go for it, you will not regret it.

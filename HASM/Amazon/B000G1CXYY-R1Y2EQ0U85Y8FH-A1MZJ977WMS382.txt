Title: Great heater
Content:
I bought this for a large office that's always freezing. This heater warms up the room quickly and keeps me toasty while it's sitting on my desk four feet away from me. It's light weight, chock full of safety features and exceedingly simple to operate. After comparing reviews on various units here, I saved twenty bucks and bought mine for under $30 w/immediate shipping elsewhere so shop around for the best deal.

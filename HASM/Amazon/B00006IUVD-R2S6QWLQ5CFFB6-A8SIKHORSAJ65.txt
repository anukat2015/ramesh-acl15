Title: Love it!
Content:
I know of people who have had trouble with this product, and I did too initially.  Then I figured out NOT to use the mesh coffee filter that came it!  I don't know why it doesn't always work right when you do use it (the percolating coffee overflows sometimes), but there you have it.  I started using the small paper filters in place of their mesh filter and haven't had a lick of trouble since!  (The 16 oz. white styrofoam cups work perfectly with this little jewel as well!)

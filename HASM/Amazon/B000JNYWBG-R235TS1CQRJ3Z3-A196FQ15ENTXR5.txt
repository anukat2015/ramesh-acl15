Title: Depends on what you want...not what I want
Content:
I don't actually have one but have seen other's.  It is not for me, and whether it's good for you depends on what you want.  I am a very basic user.  I have the Ipod classic 60 and that is enough for me.  I don't have anything but music and I have about 1200 songs on it and still have plenty of room.  It works great and hardly every freezes.  The wheel works great.  And it has playlists, something the Touch doesn't have.  I love setting up playlists and changing them.  I would really miss it.  So before you get the touch I pod, you really need to consider your needs and wants.  I absolutely love my ipod classic and can't imagine trading it in for the latest technology just because it's there.

Title: I didn't know how much I needed an Ipod until I got thissss!
Content:
I put off purchasing an Ipod for a long time. I guess that since I had nothing to compare it to, I don't feel there is anything slow about my Ipod classic, as other reviewers have complained. 
I love that you can "shuffle" your entire musical library and just let it play. I found it very easy to learn to use with one exception. Somehow I locked the volume lower than I want it to be, and can't figure out how to unlock it. It keeps asking for a password, which I must have entered by mistake somehow! I'll probably have to contact the company to figure out how to adjust my volume back up. 
Other than that, I absolutely love not having to schlep CD's around with me. It' well worth the price for the convenience. If you are thinking of getting one, just do it!

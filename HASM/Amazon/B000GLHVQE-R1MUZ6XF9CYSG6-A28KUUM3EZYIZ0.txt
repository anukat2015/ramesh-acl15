Title: Decorative heater
Content:
My brother and his wife have one of these in their finished basement. When they got another tv and had no tv stand to put it on, she moved an old desk over to the wall and put the tv on top of the desk, then just for fun she put this heater under the desk where you would sit and put your legs. It's a very fun look, and it was just a fluke that the heater fits under there perfectly. I wouldn't recommend leaving the heater unattended but its fun for parties,etc The heater works very well and they have had it for several years.

Title: Not a setup for the faint of heart
Content:
This camera may be fine for the work I do (high-quality serious-amateur photography), but it may not be something you want to lug around with you everywhere you go like you would a compact camera. The image quality is superb, but the price I pay for that is something a bit unwieldy for the average person seeking a snapshot and not necessarily magazine-quality spreads. You ought to be aware of this when purchasing this.
From a serious-amateur perspective, the camera's image quality (particularly when working with raw images) is outstanding. The 15.1 MP sensor (coupled with a good lens) can pick up detail to such an extent that you can positively ID a person on a small boat a ways away, or even read the text on the side of the boat.

Title: Cleanliness That You Can Feel - Great For Allergies
Content:
Pros:
-When you use a conventional vacuum cleaner, you see dust blown all over especially if you look with the sun rays streaming through your window. You see a much big difference using this vac. One of our sons have bad allergies and this helps a lot.
-You not only see the difference, you also feel that you are breathing much cleaner air.
-No expensive bags to buy
Cons:
-It is heavy as a bulldozer. Imagine hauling it up and down the stairs. This is the reason we use this vac not as often as our other regular vac. My wife has to call me to help tugging it along.
-Price - too much! We got it half price, but probably we still paid too much.
-Maneuverability. Annoying and it really needs some muscle to work with it.
-You also need to clean the vacuum every single time you use it. No, you cannot wait until the bag is full - there is no bag. It has a canister that you fill halfway with water and if you do not clean after each use, it grows bacteria and smells like a dead skunk. Believe me, we have done that.
-It is a hassle to use. Need assembly every time you use it. 
-So loud

Title: You're a cute little sucker
Content:
Purchased as replacement for "Dust buster".  Unit is adequate to the task of picking up smaller stuff.  Have not used it for wet pickup at this time but would assume from suction that it would work as advertised.  My wife's main complaint is that the power button MUST be held for unit to work.  After a few minutes, it becomes troublesome to hold pressure on the power button.  Power seems to be adequate as we use it for only a few minutes at a time.  An improvement would be to have a "switch" user could place in "ON or OFF" position.  Charging base receives power head very easily after a few practice dockings, unit is held securely and base can be wall mounted.

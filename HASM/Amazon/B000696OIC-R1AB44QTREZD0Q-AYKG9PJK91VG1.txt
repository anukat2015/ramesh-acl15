Title: Best Coffee Maker Ever!
Content:
I have severe twisted arthritis in both hands, and this coffee maker has been a blessing for me.  Never spills when brewing, and has a wide mouth filter for pouring in grounds!  I'll share three techniques that circumvent any negative comment you have read.  Trick is that you need a pour stream pencil thick, like Senseo, BUT that also gives you a frothy foam on every cup.:)  When I got my 10 cup DeLonghi, I played with the carafe over the sink, and quickly found that the lid seal needs to be slid to the top rim.  That, with the pencil thin pour stream, eliminated any and all drips.  Now when screwing on the lid to the carafe, you can keep your hand on the right of the lid to easily grip the groove: it's that simple.  Everything slides with ease, despite my weak crippled hands, and I am thrilled with the product.

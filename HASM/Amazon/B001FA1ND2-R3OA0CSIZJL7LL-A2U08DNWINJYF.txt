Title: Small Size, Big Picture and Sound
Content:
This is a great iPod.  The video is much improved over my iPod Classic, even thought the screen is slightly smaller.  I use my iPod in the gym and the size makes it very easy to carry around.  My kids use the video on long car rides and they think the picture is crystal clear.  The sound is also improved over the iPod classic.

Title: good travelling companion
Content:
I have never had an MP3 player before, but I was planning a long bus trip and decided I needed something to keep me entertained.  I found the SanDisk SDMX4 loaded with my music and pod cast an excellent way to pass the time.  I chose this particular MP3 player for a number of reasons.  The 8 Gig size, the FM tunner, the estimated 20 hour play time and a price well below Apple products.  There are some things that I wish were better.  I found the ear buds uncomfortable, I would have liked a "scan for station" feature on the tunner.  Finally, I found it more difficult then necessary to load things on it from my computer.  For example, I wanted to put a picture of my family on there to be able to show people, but I had to mess around with several program to get a picture that visible.  Nevertheless I am not sorry that I got it.

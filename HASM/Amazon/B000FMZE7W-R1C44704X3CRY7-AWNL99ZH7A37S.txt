Title: Great starting point.
Content:
Honestly, this is the second MP3 player i've owned (still have my Zen 8gig microphoto) and I absolutly love it. I was all gung ho about the iPod. my cousin has one and i thought it was awsome, but I figured, id go with something different. I have absolutly no complaints at all. All I need a player to do is organize my music how I want it, and play it, and it does just that. 
Sure the wi-fi feature is off, but like i said, its a starting point. Nothing else has that (that i know of), so no reason to cut it down. If I remember correctly, the ipod was sort of boring when it first came out as well. And to compare this first gen product, to a first gen ipod or zen, would be crazy. I love the navigation, the clarity of the pictures, and everything. 
And something else peopel may not seem to be thinking about (I see a lot of you have multiple ipods), instead of having to buy a whole new upgraded player (version 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, etc) I think microsoft may just decided to let you download the upgrade.. just something to think about.

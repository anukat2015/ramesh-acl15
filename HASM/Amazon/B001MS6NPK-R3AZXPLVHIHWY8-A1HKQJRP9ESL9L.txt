Title: Nice computer, but having comflict w/the vista
Content:
Just received my Sony gorgeous pink laptop and tried to hooking  my new matching Microsoft wireless mouse up to USB.  Microsoft Vista recognized the mouse but the mouse will not operate.  I also tried hooking up my new Kodak all in one printer without success.  
After spending over 5 hours on sunday tt Sony technical support I was no more ahead than when I first started.  
I now have a computer tech coming tomorrow to either get the mouse working on vista or downgrade me to XP.  
I am not faulting Sony because it is a great product and almost everything I own that is electronic is manufactured by Sony.  The problem lies with Miscrosoft Vista!

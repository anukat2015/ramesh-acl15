Title: Works as advertised
Content:
This heater works well.  I use this to heat an added on mud room 8x16 that only has one furnace vent.  I keep the heater on low 24hrs a day during the winters (average temps 10-30 degrees).  The heater works as advertised and makes the tile less cold to walk on.  Very satisfied with the purchase.

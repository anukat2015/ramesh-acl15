Title: Good, but not perfect
Content:
I've had this for about 2 months and I'm very pleased with it.  It was half the price of a 20GB ipod and had 10 more GB.  First some of the negatives.  I had to change the meta data on my ahem.. less than legal songs so that they were sorted correctly.  Also it locks up occasionally while transferring songs.
Despite the negatives, it gives you great value for your money and the software that comes with it is pretty good.  It allows you to choose what you want to load on the player instead of automatically deleting your songs like itunes.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone not looking to spend a ton of money on an ipod.

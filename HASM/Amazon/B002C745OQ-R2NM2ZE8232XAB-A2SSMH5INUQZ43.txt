Title: One of the best notebook computers on the market
Content:
It does not feel cheap, and it is very FAST. This is a speedy computer in many ways. I run everything from iWork, iLife, Windows with Parallels, Microsoft Office, Oracle Database, FileMaker, Photoshop, Xcode, Visual Studio, etc. If you want a real computer (by the way, Mac OS X is a Unix operating system),  this is the one.

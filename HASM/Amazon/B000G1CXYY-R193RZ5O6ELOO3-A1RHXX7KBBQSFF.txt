Title: NOT SAFE!!!
Content:
I was ready to give a glowing review about this heater, as it works very well, BUT when one of my cats accidentally knocked it over, it STAYED ON.  It does not shut off.  In any direction it continues to run if tipped over.  This is very dangerous & I'm totally surprised Delonghi can manufacture a heating unit without a safety cut off feature, let alone sell it in the U.S.
Please don't buy this heater!!  Wish I hadn't....

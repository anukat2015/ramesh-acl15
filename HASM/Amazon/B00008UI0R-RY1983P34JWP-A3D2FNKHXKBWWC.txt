Title: Never thought I would love a vacuum more than I do  Fantoms until I tried this Hoover.
Content:
I purchased this Hoover because I have a Fantom Fury and while I thought it still worked like new based on what was in the canaster, it was showing signs of its age and litterally falling apart. The mechine still ran like new though. I vacuumed with it and then with this new Hoover and the dirt container of the Hoover was full after doing a small dinning room average size living room and just the smallest hallway. I emptyed the container and fould all sorts of trash. Dust, sand, dog hair, cat hair and a leaf. Then I did my 3 bedrooms and had to empty the canaster twice to get through them. The mechine is so much quieter than most vacuums. The attachments are wonderful, and actually work while being easy to use and switch from floors to attachments and back. I love that all the controls are right at your finger tips and with the touch of a button you can do carpets or hard floors. Plus this model is the deluxe model and Amazon is selling it for $20.00 less than the base model sells for in stores. I was worried about the fact that this Hoover Windtunnel had the filter in the canaster because this usually causes the filter to clog quickly but Hoover designed this mechine to trap the dirt under 2 flaps in the container so only the dirty air gets to the filter. This design really does work. I never thought that I would replace a Fantom with any other brand even if it meant going throught ebay to buy used ones since they are out of business but this Hoover has changed my mind. I absolutly love it and encourage everyone to buy it.

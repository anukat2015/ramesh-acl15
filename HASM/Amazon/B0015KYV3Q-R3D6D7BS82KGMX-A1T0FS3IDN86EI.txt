Title: SanDisk Sansa Fuze
Content:
100% satisfied with the Fuze.  Love how it is able to shuffle randomly between the memory card and the built in memory.  My Creative Zen (which I still have and like)can not do that.  The ability to buy 1,000 songs already loaded on a micro SD card is also nice plus.

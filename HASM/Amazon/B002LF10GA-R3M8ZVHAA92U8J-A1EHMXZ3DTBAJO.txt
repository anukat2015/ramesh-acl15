Title: Pleasantly Surprised!
Content:
This Acer Aspire 1410 computer is perfect for us at ages 58 and 60.  We had our son-in-law pick out something simple, wireless, and reasonably priced.  He did an outstanding job.  First of all, he went to the customer reviews...which we had never thought about.  He studied all the customer reviews from the various companies.  After considerable study, he selected this one for us.  It is a pleasant surprise.  The tech support is excellent, too.  My husband and I have to work on computers at our jobs.  I am a bookkeeper and he is an attorney.  We only know what we have to know for our work, for emails, and for shopping.  But after reading the info sheet, it can do so much more...so young people would like it, too.  The keyboard is easy to read, even though it's not quite as large as a lap top.  The screen is very readable, too.  It has a 6 hour battery charge, so we can go wireless when we're out-of town.  So, now all we need is a bag to carry it safely in...which we are presently ordering.

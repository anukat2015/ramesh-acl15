Title: failed after 1 week
Content:
One week after I received this model, I was unable to boot the machine in normal mode. I was also unable to get the machine to reach a system restore point from the safe mode. I have no option but to restore it to the factory settings which will lose all the information I have entered in the first week. I understand the value of regularly doing backups but I guess  will have to do a daily back up due to the fickle nature of this machine. What a disappointment............

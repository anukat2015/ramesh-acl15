Title: Great prosumer camera
Content:
Great camera for the price. Has a lot of features. I mostly shoot in manual and aperture priority. Do keep in mind that this is a cropped sensor camera - I didn't know about cropped sensors before buying this camera. So those of you like me that are switching over from a film SLR will notice that the view finder is a lot smaller then what you're use to. But a full frame will set you back a lot more, so this is a good one to start with. 
The only thing I was concerned about was megapixels, thinking more is better. But if you're only going to be printing as large as 5x7 than, this really shouldn't be that much of a concern. I've read that the D series (30D, 40D, etc.) produces images with much less noise, so these might be cameras you may want to consider as well. 
I upgraded to the Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 lens, and it is SUPER sharp. Highly recommended combo, but 28mm is a bit too tight for some indoor shots, so I got a 12-24 as well.

Title: Excellent!
Content:
I was the first guy to buy this laptop at the Sony store in Beverly Hills-- I bought it hours after it arrived. I've had it for about six weeks now. It is an excellent, very high quality and well built machine. It is visually beautiful and the user experience is the best I have ever experienced with a laptop. It is incredibly fast-- in fact with sophisticated benchmark programs it runs almost as fast as my custom built desktop i5 machine. Even though it is expensive, it is worth the money. In an odd way, at $1899, it is a good buy.
My only gripe is that there seems to be an issue from time to time with the video card or Dynamic Hybrid Graphics System. This system isn't working out as well as I'd hope. If it was omitted from this machine, it would be a solid 5 star review.
When I first bought the computer it stalled and the video went black almost every time I used it t play video. After I did the software update the problem went away for the most part. Now the video only crashes about once a week. This is why I am only giving it 4 stars. Overall though, I would by this laptop again in a second. It is light years ahead of everything else I checked out and I am not a Mac guy. They are less prone to software and software based hardware complications but they don't advance as quickly and you pay a high premium for lesser hardware.

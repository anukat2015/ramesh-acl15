Title: Toshiba has poor warranty
Content:
The computer works great
But the warranty is worthless.
Not covering the broken LCD screen and/or visable outside covers/plastic or powersupply is common. But Toshiba has wording (they donot share with you beyoned the small print) that allowes them to not cover internal brakage. Our $249 extanded on site 3 year warranty purchase proved worthless when the internal power connector got loose. At the Toshiba dealer site they wanted $425 to fix it. A power connector.
If you feel this is 'fair and customery" buy Toshiba. Otherwise go with Dell or Panasonic.

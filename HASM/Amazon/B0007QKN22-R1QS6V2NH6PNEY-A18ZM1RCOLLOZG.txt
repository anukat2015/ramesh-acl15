Title: I'm in love
Content:
This is probably the best non-breathing thing I have. I absolutely love this thing!!! To be frank I did not compare with Nikon counterparts or other Canon cameras, I also have never used another SLR before so I went with what most reviews said about the XT. Almost bought the XTi but price difference at the time was $200. Plus I love the information screen on these cameras and dont mind the small LCD screen. XTi seems a better deal now as the price difference has shrunk (bye bye XT). Anyways, this is a GREAT camera.  Pictures are way way better than a conventional digital camera. Even at ISO 1600 pictures look great. Bought a Canon 50mm 1.8, and Tamron 17-50 F2.8 + Tamron 70-300 lens. Great combo, stored kit lens in the closet (ok lens but kind of boring). I feel like a pro now and plan to learn about photography seriously. Canon 30D and 40D are way sexier, might upgrade later after I build a nice lens collection.

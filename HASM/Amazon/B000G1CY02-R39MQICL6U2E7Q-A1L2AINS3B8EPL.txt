Title: Works as advertised
Content:
The heater works as advertised and although it doesn't have a readable thermostat it's fairly easy to achieve a comfortable temperature and then set the heater to maintain it. I also like the two levels of energy use allowing you to use 750w or 1500w depending on your situation. It's quiet and appears to be saving us some nickels on our energy costs.

Title: A Marvel...
Content:
I guess Macs are just a matter of taste, but for me this machine is beautiful.  It performs wonderfully, it's fast both with mac os and vista, games run great. I don't find the screen to be annoying, sure is reflective but once you are focused on what you are doing you completely forget about it. at least that's what happened with me, it runs hot under vista, specially playing games. nothing that bothers me though, what is important to be noticed is that the edges are prompt to be dented very easily, so special caution should be taken.
I previously had a late 2007 macbook pro and this one is noticeably faster, and has a brighter screen. Black keys on aluminium? they look awesome and matches the screen bessel very well... this design has no equal hands down.

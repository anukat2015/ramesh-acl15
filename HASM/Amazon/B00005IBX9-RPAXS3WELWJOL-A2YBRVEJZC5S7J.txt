Title: Style AND Substance
Content:
After MUCH comparing of coffee makers I decided on the Cuisinart. Yes, it's beautiful but is it worth taking up space on your counter? I absolutely love this thing. It makes good HOT coffee and did I mention that it was beautiful? Others have complained about it being hard to pour the water in? I haven't had any problem with it. If you use the carafe that comes with the unit it has a nice pointy spout that easily pours into the tank. I have gotten rid of my Brita water filter as a result of buying this pot as it also comes with a water filtration system of it's own. Make sure that you have space for this that is NOT under a cabinet as it's rather tall and you'd have to slide it out from under the cabinet to open the top. I also have started to leave the top cracked open for a few hours after I'm through with it to allow the condensation to evaporate.  Sometimes quality kitchen items have to be handled with a little extra care you wouldn't put your Sabatier knives in the dishwasher would you? I also found the price very reasonable for the quality of this item and I can't even remember the last time I said THAT! And - it IS beautiful afterall.

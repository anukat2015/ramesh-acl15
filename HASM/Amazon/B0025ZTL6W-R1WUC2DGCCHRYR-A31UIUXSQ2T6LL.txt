Title: DC22 Turbinehead has pros but significant cons
Content:
Had it two years, most frustrating thing is that is basically an excellent product but that it could be SO MUCH BETTER with a few minor adjustments - wait for the upgraded version!!!
Pros:
This vacuum lives up to one key feature that Dyson uses as a selling point: the filtration is HEPA filter grade - excellent.  Also, no bags or throw away containers (hard to believe any vacuums are made otherwise) is a plus.
Cons:
Heavy for a small vacuum
Must be emptied after every use as container is small and fills quickly
Cord is too short - can't reach all the way across at 15' X 12' room, if they would have only added another 2' to the dam thing it would be fine.
Tube neck is too big in diameter to reach under furniture or around car seats and other tight places, the whole thing should be much narrower.
Motor (electrically driven) head suddenly loses power on occasion requiring user to press head specific power button to restart.
Other than these complaints, this product rules.

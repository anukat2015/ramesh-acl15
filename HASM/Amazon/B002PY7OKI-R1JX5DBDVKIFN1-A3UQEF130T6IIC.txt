Title: No support, low quality disappointment
Content:
I was very disappointed with the Dell and the Inspiron.  First, brand new, the battery life was good for less then 30 minutes!  Second, I had no luck getting it to connect wirelessly.  I could not get a Dell service rep on the phone, only the sales people, people who consistently told me to use the internet to access Dell's support staff.  But when using the internet, I was not able to get a real person. It was clear that when I would submit questions, a computer looked for key words in my question and generated a (useless) response accordingly.  I finally resolved the problem by seeking advice OUTSIDE of Dell -- but it took many months of great frustration to get the wireless machine to connect wirelessly.  NEVER AGAIN DELL.

Title: great camera but has issues
Content:
I had XT before purchasing XTi and I thought it is time to upgrade with the new one. Xti has sensor cleaning feature and other nice things. When I got the camera, my test shots turned out a dissapointment. It may be psychologic or real, but I did not like the pictures that came out of the camera. I searched canon user forums and some people reported that the new XTi is slightly different than the original in terms of color and light adjustments. Conclusion: I returned the camera and bought a nice used Canon 20D on eBay with a lot of classic features (and cheaper than XTi).

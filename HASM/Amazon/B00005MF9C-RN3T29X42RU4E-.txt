Title: Doesn't quite deliver.
Content:
I love the IDEA of this product as I'm the only one in the house that drinks coffee and only usually have one cup at a time.  The unit is small and the mug attractive.  However, I've used this three times now, and ALL three times, the grounds from the coffee spill over into the rest of the unit from the filter.  I'm using the recommended amount and yet the filter seems to be too small or not working properly.It also doesn't work as fast as I would think for a product called &quot;Brew N Go&quot;.  It seems like it is done, but then if you take the travel mug away, it keeps dripping ... all over your counter.. for a few minutes.The hassle of cleaning up grounds from everywhere is starting to outweight the benefit of having fresh coffee at home.

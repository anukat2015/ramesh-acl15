Title: Good Product, weak software
Content:
My son got prompted to update the IPod from ITunes..... when he did via his browser window, the application hung and corrupted his unit. When I called tech support on "my one time free" call. They explained that could happen with this rollout and suggested we should have saved the file locally and ran the update..... I told them your software should suggest that then!
Terrible.... weak software.... that's rolled out with bugs.
No wonder they have less than 5% of the computer market!
I'll never buy an Apple product again!

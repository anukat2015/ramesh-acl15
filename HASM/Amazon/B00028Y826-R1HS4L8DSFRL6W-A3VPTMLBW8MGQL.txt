Title: 2.5 years and going strong
Content:
I bought this MP3 player 2.5 years ago,and have had no problems with it. I used it off and on for most of the time, but this past month I use it daily when going for walks. It holds enough music for my hour long stroll about town. The battery life seems to last a while. It's no big concern to carry an extra battery anyway. Very easy to plug and ply on my pc and my laptop, no software needed. All music is loaded via drag'n'drop. I do use an outside program to rip my cd's to mp3,which is a life saver.
I've also used this as a flash drive before I bought a 2 gig usb drive.
My only true complaint is the earbuds, I hate them with a passion. So I replaced them with a pair of behind the neck head phones, problem solved.
Only thing I wish I did different was to not get FM radio (Sirius Subscriber,so I avoid terrestrial radio), and maybe more memory. But 40 or so songs is enough to cover my daily walk routine.
All in all(minus the ear buds) I'd say this little guy has been very reliable. I wouldn't hesitate to get another if I have to.

Title: Why do I need a title
Content:
This computer doesn't have any problems. It is fast, screen is huge, great picture, comes with Windows 7, and a huge hard drive. This is everything you want in a desktop but it is portable. If I had to write one con it would be that the mouse is tacky which means it can grab your finget sometimes when you move it across the pad. I would recommend this to anybody. I researched laptops for a couple of weeks and this had everything. Take a look at this if you are considering any type of laptop.

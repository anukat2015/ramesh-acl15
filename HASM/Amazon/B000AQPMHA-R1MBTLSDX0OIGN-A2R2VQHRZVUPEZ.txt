Title: Perfect Solution to a Problem I Didn't Know I Had
Content:
The Keurig system works wonderfully. The B40 is fast, makes a great cup of coffee every time, (but not necessarily the SAME cup of coffee unless that's what you want,) and there's no mess to clean. The biggest potential drawback I can see is that it MAY NOT fit under your cabinets. Make sure to measure if the counter area of your home seems relatively height restricted. It doesn't fit comfortably for us but the system is so good we have zero regrets anyway. 
There has been some discussion of the economics here...about .50 per cup (better on Amazon, actually.) I find I SAVE money because now I always drink a strong cup of coffee at home and am less tempted to buy it at a retail outlet on the way to work or whatever. Your mileage may vary, but I find that resisting that extra purchase -- as little as one cup of gourmet coffee a week at a place like Starbucks (or two at Dunking Donuts,) -- pretty much pays for a month's supply of K-cups. To my palate the quality seems directly comparable; in any case it's certainly very good.
Try it, you'll like it.

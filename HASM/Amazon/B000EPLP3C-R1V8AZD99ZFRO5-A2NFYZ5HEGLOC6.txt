Title: Better than IPOD
Content:
I've had both, first i dont have to worry about the converting music into the Itunes, second, when I'm at the gym I can tune into the gym's FM freqeuncy and listen to the TV while working out. The Sync on the zune is faster than the IPOD. The shortfall is Marketplace doesnt have as much, but anything in the itunes can also be put on your zune. So i just pawn off my girlfriend's Itunes libary, hehehe, dont tell her.

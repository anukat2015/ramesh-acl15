Title: Great little heater
Content:
I bought this heater last year and imediately thought I had made a mistake.  But after using it a while, it has become my favorite room heater.  I can use it anywhere and not be afraid of fire, it's the only electric heater I will leave on at night.  As stated above the back does get hotter than the brochure indicates, but certainly not hot enough to start a fire, so I use it on the provided legs.  At night I turn the thermastat down and use this heater in my bedroom, it has really saved me on energy cost.  I love it's portability.
I believe many people are not use to the way this heater works, and are not giving it a chance.  I came to Amazon today to buy another one, saw some of the low ratings given by buyers, and decided to let Amazon buyers know "THIS IS EXCELLENT PRODUCT".
One thing, It will stink until the new burns off, then it's a really good heater...........My two dogs and cat love it, they live in front of it on cold days.......I don't usually write reviews for Amazon, though I buy lots of things from them, this time I felt I had to defend my choice of heaters.
By the way I have two of those Wal-mart cheapies and they can't touch this one.  I recomend this product.....

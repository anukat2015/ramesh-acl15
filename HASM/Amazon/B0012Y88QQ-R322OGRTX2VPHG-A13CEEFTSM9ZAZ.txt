Title: Canon  rebel XSi good camera, good value.
Content:
Canon Sxi is a first rate value. It does everything it should. It is for very advanced point and shoot picture taker who always forgets to charge the settings before being pushed into taking the shot now. It is built for the person who knows how to take a picture but opportunties are cluttered with the realities that nobody wants to particpate in his/her picture taking. 
Now knowing what I know, I would buy it in a minute. It is an electronic masterpiece but a hardheaded journey man's tool. A pleasure to handle in picture taking. I know there are better lens, better and more advanced electonic but for a dope like me it is just fine. I have six camera in the drawer, time and technology has passed them bye. This may not be cutting edge but is sharp enough for my use.

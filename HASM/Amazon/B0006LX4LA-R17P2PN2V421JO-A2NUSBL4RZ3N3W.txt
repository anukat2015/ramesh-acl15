Title: Could be better
Content:
Everytime I pour a cup of coffee, I think to myself "I need to go write a review!" because of spillage.  I can't seem to pour it in the maker itself or into a cup without spilling water or coffee. It's a very cute coffee maker and it makes about 2 medium sized coffee mugs of coffee.  It keeps the coffee hot and the sneak a cup works fine for me.  Never upset about how it tastes or looks...just how it pours.  So have a paper towel handy.

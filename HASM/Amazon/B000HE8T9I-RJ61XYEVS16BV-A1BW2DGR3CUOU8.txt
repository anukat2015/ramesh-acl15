Title: Better than a Dyson at half the price
Content:
I have to admit, I was all set to buy a Dyson.  Then I saw that this "knock-off" of a Dyson was coming out and I was intrigued. After all, this vacuum is less than half the price, could it really do as good of a job?  The answer is a resounding YES!!  
This vacuum was easy to assemble. Basically you just snap a few pieces together and you are set to go.  The suction power is amazing!  The vacuum was also very effective at picking up TONS of pet hair. Emptying this vacuum is also a breeze.  Basically, you hold the canister over the garbage, press a button and the bottom of the canister drop down and all the dirt dumps out. Much easier than my bagless Hoover whereby I had to bang the filter against the side of the garbage can resulting in a cloud of dust every time I had to empty out the canister. 
The only thing that some people might find to be a negative with this vacuum is that you do have to clean the vacuum regularly in order for the vacuum to maintain its suction.  This would be true of any bagless vacuum cleaner though.  If you don't like to clean your vacuum, stick with a bagged version.  I prefer cleaning the vacuum though, as opposed to having to fork out $30 on a filter every few months as I had to with my Hoover. 
All in all, this is an excellent machine for the money.  I admit, I was sceptical when I received this and even saved the box so that I could return it and get a Dyson if I was unhappy.  Luckily, that won't be necessary AND I get to keep the $200 that I saved in my pocket!  Bottom line, if you are considering getting a Dyson, give this vacuum a try, you won't be disappointed.

Title: pretty good
Content:
my main problem with the zune was getting it to connect to my computer. i had to spend over 4 hours searching their forums to find a solution. from what i read this has been affecting many users dating back to 2007 which tells me microsoft doesn't have a software fix for this. 
the actually zune itself is a very good product. the fm radio gets most, not all, of the stations in my area. navigating through your media library is super easy with a touch-sensitive square pad. the sound quality varies by your earphones but the ones in the box are wretched. battery life is pretty good. if you have wifi on its signifigantly lower. the ability to download tracks right from the zune is incredibly useful and you can also add songs you hear on its radio to your download queue. all in all, its a great alternative to an ipod nano or similar device

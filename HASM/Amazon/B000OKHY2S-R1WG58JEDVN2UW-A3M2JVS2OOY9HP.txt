Title: Works Very Well In Special Situations
Content:
I live in the Southern California desert.  My home air conditioner system does not cool the house evenly, especially the west facing or upstairs rooms.  I find this unit does an excellent job in bring down the temperature in those room by about 10 degrees.  I use this unit all the time during the summer.  I am able to set my home air conditioner at a higher temperature and save $$$.  The unit will NOT cool down an entire house, or cool a room more than 10 degrees or work in a humid area.  I highly recommend this product for these special situations.

Title: Just what we needed
Content:
We were looking for an alternative to central heating for a small living room(150-200sq feet?). We had tried ceramic heaters, but they are noisy and very inefficient at heating a whole room, they also tend to get dirty over time. From day one we were happy with our choice. It is  silent and heats the room to a comfortable temp. in about 15-20min (OK, we live in San Francisco, so it is never that cold). I always use the "comfortable temperature" button instead of the regular thermostat and once the room is heated, you can reduce the power to the min setting without negative noticing any difference in temp. In short no fumes, no maintenance, not too big, silent and does the job, what else do you want?

Title: A good vacuum
Content:
I haven't used more than half a dozen vacuums, but this is definitely the best one of that bunch. It seems quite capable and has a number of what I consider to be nice features: a continuously variable power setting, relatively light weight, a convenient bagless design that is easy to empty, and a versatile, extendable arm with multiple attachments.

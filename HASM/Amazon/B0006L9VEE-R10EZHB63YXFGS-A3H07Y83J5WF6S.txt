Title: Poor product, Poor support
Content:
I had this coffee maker less than three months when it just stopped brewing in the middle of a brewing cycle. I immediately called customer support and spoke with Erica. She was very pleasant and offered several suggestions, including de-scaling the machine. She told me to call her back regardless of the results. None of her suggestions succeeded, including de-scaling, which proved to be impossible since the DeLonghi wouldn't brew anyway. And if the coffee maker did need de-scaling, its built-in de-scaling warning light never went on. In any case, I had a mess on my hands and called DeLonghi customer service back. This time I reached Amanda, who couldn't have been nastier and wouldn't or couldn't allow me to speak to Erica. I asked to speak to her supervisor, Josh, who was extremely condescending and unhelpful. Unfortunately, it was then that I decided to do my research, not before. It turned out there were numerous complaints registered with the Better Business Bureau concerning DeLonghi, several of which DeLonghi simply didn't respond to. DeLonghi's policy required ME to pay to ship their product to a service facility in Delaware for them to decide what to do with the machine. This is a very expensive coffee maker that has virtually no special features to warrant such a price tag. I am sorry I didn't do my research before I bought such a terrible product with awful customer support. Be warned before you repeat my mistake. I am currently awaiting word from the powers that be as to the disposition of my $225 investment.

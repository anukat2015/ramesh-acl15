Title: Yum Yum Warm Coffee
Content:
Such an easy coffeemaker to have.  Does everything for you (grinds and filters water) and keeps coffee warm for HOURS without a heating element.
Presets and has a special button for brewing less than 4 cups (so your coffee will still taste right) and another if you're using pre-ground so the grinder won't needlessly run.
One warning - the grinder is quite loud and can be a frightening jolt from the quiet of a morning, certainly gets your heart beating...
Seriously great coffeemaker though.

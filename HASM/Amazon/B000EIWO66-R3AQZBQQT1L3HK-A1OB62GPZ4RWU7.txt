Title: Royal Procision RY3050
Content:
I love this vacuum so much I bought a second one. The suction power on this thing is great. I have both hardwood floors and carpet, so this vacuum can do it all. Also great for reaching up to my ceiling fans. I have a LARGE family as well as lots of pets that shed like crazy. This vacuum gets up everything, even the down fur under my dags coat that tens to stick to whatever it touches - pulls it right up!!! This is my 4th Royal vacuum and they usually last around 4 years with the kind of use I put them through. Can't complain. =)

Title: Perfect Little Device
Content:
I'm very pleased and impressed with this little heater. It puts out plenty of heat, takes up a tiny little space on the floor, and has a great thermostat. I'm not an expert on small heaters, but I've had a much larger radiant heater in the past, and I've been around people who use those oil radiators, and this little thing beats them all in my opinion. I'm using it to provide extra heat for a basement office which has a walk out sliding door. This space needs a little extra and this heater does a great job of it. The themostat also makes sure that I get no more heat than I want, and that the heater doesn't drive me from the room ;-).

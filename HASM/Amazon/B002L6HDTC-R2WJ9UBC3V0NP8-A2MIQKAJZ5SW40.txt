Title: Excellent product yet so small
Content:
We purchased the Apple Nano to use in car on trips, so we didn't need to carry boxes of CD'S.  It playes thru car radio audio system.  It is great, now we take videos when we only have a min. to catch a picture.  The sound and picture quality is so great for such a compact, nice looking, and very easy to use Ipod.  You will not go wrong in buying an Apple iPod nano.  (In any color)

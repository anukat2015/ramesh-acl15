Title: good coffee, bad service
Content:
I was happy with the coffee maker until 3mos from the date of purchase it stopped brewing coffee.  When I reviewed the warranty info in the manual, I was not happy.  After paying $100 for the machine (which I thought was a lot for a "coffeemaker"), the manufacturer wants me to pay for shipping the defective product back and I am also responsible for a $10 fee as well.  I opened a service order with the manufacturer and they clearly gave me instructions to return defective unit with payment or I could pay with a CC over the phone - I told the rep I would call back the next day with CC#.  Without payment or defective unit they sent me the replacement machine.  Some may think I am foolish for not keeping the machine, however, I called them back and asked why they shipped when I did not call back all they said was that they would authorize pickup of the unit.  I am waiting for UPS to pick up now. I will think twice before purchasing any Cuisinart product in the future.

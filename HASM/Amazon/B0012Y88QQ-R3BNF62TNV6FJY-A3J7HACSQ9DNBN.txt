Title: Excellent Value
Content:
7 years with a Canon F1 followed by 4 or 5 P&S digital cameras didn't prepare me for the control flexibility of this camera.   When the settings are right, the results are stunning.  If you're going to leave it on full auto all the time, you aren't going to get the quality images the camera is capable of.

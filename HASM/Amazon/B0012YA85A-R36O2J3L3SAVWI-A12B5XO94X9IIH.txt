Title: Great Starter Camera For Hobbyist
Content:
I've had this camera for over a year now and it is still pretty great, in my opinion. Great functions, great controls and a great starter-camera for those learning about photography. However, after learning so much from this "little wonder," I want to upgrade to a pro or pro-sumer level Canon body. But for the price, you can't beat it. The pics turn out great (given the right settings). I would suggest buying an external flash and another lens, though. I wish I had just bought the camera body and then purchased a different lens a year ago. The kit lens is okay, but not the best. Still, a wonderful camera. You can't go wrong.

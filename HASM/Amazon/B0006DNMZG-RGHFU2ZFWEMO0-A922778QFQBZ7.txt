Title: Good features, but doesnt get the main job done
Content:
I bought this product because of the Honeywell brand and star rating. This heater has some well thought features included, but on the whole it fails in its objective. You wont feel the heat from this thing unless you 'tent' around it. I live in Chicago, and this thing doesnt work well enough to fight the cold. Buy something better.

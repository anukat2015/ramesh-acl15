Title: As advertized
Content:
I'm renovating an old house...gutting would be more appropriate. It's not like the open-to-the-rafters interior is like a sauna, but it is definitely warmer than it would be in this particularly cold Long Island winter. I put a 50-ft 12 guage cord on this with a twist lock 30 amp plug so we can stretch it out to where we are working. And once I am done with the interior of the house, I will be moving the heater to the garage with a permanent connection. As to comparisons with other heaters at "the jobsite," what distinguishes the Dayton, is the fan. It's strong enough to push the heated air out over far more area than the little heaters that are designed to work with most electrical systems - 15 amp outlets...

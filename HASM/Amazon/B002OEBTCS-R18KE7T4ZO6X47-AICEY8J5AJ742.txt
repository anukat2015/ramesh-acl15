Title: Excellent Camera with fantastic package for beginners.
Content:
This is my first dSLR purchase and I am really happy about my choice.
I read several reviews and settled on this fabulous genius camera.
For this price $720ish you get 300mm telephoto lens as well.
I shot some low light pictures and it came out extremely well.
I bought these to go with the camera:

Upgrade the firmware, so Sanyo's eneloop batteries are recognized.

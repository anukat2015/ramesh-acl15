Title: Sucks in more ways than one....
Content:
Yes, the sucking power of this machine is awesome. I really am impressed but....
It sucks up tons of dirt but somehow 30% seems to stay stuck to the OUTSIDE of the unit? It sucks up a lot of pet hair but seems to blow out an excess amount of dust as you are vacuuming. Traps the pet hair well but blows dust everywhere. But that is not my major dislike. The worst thing about this unit is the constant belt slipping and smell of burning rubber. From the first day the belt has slipped, even on the highest settings with our cheap, thin, contractor carpet. I flipped the belt inside out, no luck. Replaced the belt, no luck. Of course I cleaned everything and the brush spins freely. But as soon as it hits carpet it starts slipping and emitting that burning rubber smell. If I hadn't lost the receipt I would have returned it already since I am back to using my old vacuum.

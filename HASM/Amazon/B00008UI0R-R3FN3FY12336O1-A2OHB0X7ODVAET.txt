Title: nice vacuum
Content:
received the vacuum before the expected delivery date. The vacuum didnt work properly, called Amazon and the representative couldnt have been more helpful.  He gave me a return mailer and sent another vacuum which arrived quicker than the first one.  This vacuum works great, has great suction, vacuums against walls great and for sure is a lot better than the one I was using.  Would recommend to anyone interested in buying a vacuum.  It also works really good on hard surfaces.

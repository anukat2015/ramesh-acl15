Title: Miele Canister Vacuums - Simply the best
Content:
I have been researching the Miele Antares Galaxy Canister vacuum. From my research, it appears that this unit and the miele brand is extremely well made (made in Germany) and should last much longer than other canister vacs.  Despite the high price, you may go through several other vacuums for the life of this one and get better service as well. 
The one negative review on this vacuum had nothing to do with the vacuum and had to do with them NOT including and attachment for rugs.  Well that complaint has now been met by Miele. As of July 2006, this unit now comes with BOTH the TB 205-3 Turbo Nozzle & SBB300-3 Parquet Floor Brush.  These will do both rugs and floors. 
If you are looking for the best, then this is it.  And it is a very attractive vacuum if that sort of thing is important to you.
If you are looking for an upright vacuum, then from the reviews I have seen, Dyson has gotten some pretty awsome ratings.  Especially for Pet Hair removal.  The Dyson Animal is the best for that.

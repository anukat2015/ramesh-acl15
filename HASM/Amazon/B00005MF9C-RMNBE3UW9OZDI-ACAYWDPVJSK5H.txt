Title: Not great
Content:
It's not as good as the old one!  I had an earlier version of this unit which was great.  I used it almost every weekday for nine years, and it worked perfectly until the end.  This new one is almost as unreliable as the old one that I had to replace when it became, well, unreliable.  The unit is made for 12 ounces, but a) it doesn't pump out all of the water, and b) if you put enough coffee in for a 12 ounce cup the grounds spill out into the reservoir and splash up on the inside of the cover.  Summary:  the earlier version made a perfect 10 ounce cup of coffee EVERY time until it wore out.  This model is iffy - when it works right it makes a good 10 ounce cup of coffee, but it's not good for a bigger cup, and even the 10 ounce cup is unreliable.  Interestingly, the unit that I bought in 2001 cost about $20 as did this 2010 unit!

Title: Attractive and powerful
Content:
WalMart has this heater for $40, so I bought mine there.  I live in an old farmhouse and needed a small heater to use when it's drafty to conserve my fuel oil heat.  This little heater is really cute and heats up my living room with no problems.  It's great for supplemental heat and puts out more heat than the electric fireplace I bought.

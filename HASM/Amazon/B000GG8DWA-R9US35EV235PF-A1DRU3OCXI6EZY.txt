Title: Masterful little thing
Content:
We have 3 of these little wonders, one in our bedroom, one in the guest bedroom and one in the media room. With the central heating these rooms are heated all the time and with these little wonders we can use them when we need them and they warm up a room pretty quick.
Will advice anybody to buy them!

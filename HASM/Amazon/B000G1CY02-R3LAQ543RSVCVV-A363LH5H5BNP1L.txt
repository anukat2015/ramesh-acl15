Title: Good safe heater for baby's room
Content:
We needed a small heater to keep our new born's room warm during the winter when we turn the central heat down to about 60 degrees.  This is little light weight  heater has been idea.  It keeps the room nicely warm yet it doesn't get dangerously hot to the touch, at least when kept on the low setting.  It does, of course, get hot enough that you wouldn't want to hold your hand against the front screen for more than a few seconds, nor allow a blanket or such to come in contact.  But it's a lot cooler than many of the others we've seen, and it wouldn't burn you or baby just from a quick contact.  My only complaint is that the power on indicator light burnt out within a week of purchase, but otherwise it has been just what we needed.

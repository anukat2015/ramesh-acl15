Title: So much more than an iPod
Content:
Single handedly the best $270 I have ever spent. Great for music the screen is better than my hdtv For video. Apps are amazing controls are great. 
I only have two complaints:
1. No flash player so many websites won't work
2. No mic if you don't like the earbuds you can't use voicecontrol and some apps like shazam need a mike to work
But otherwise amazing worth every penny

Title: Worked great -- for a while
Content:
My machine is about a year and a half old and it has stopped brewing for the second time and it is not responding to the descaling they recommend.  There is no service center in my state so by the time I mail it outstate it will be cheaper to buy another coffee maker -- and friends, it won't be this one.

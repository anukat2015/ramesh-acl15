Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
After looking long and hard for a replacement for our little Krups coffee maker that we had for I don't even know how long, I decided to get this Cuisinart Model a week ago. 
Following the instructions, we made a whole pot with just hot water to clean it from dust or whatever else might have been there. Someone mentioned a strong plastic smell/taste. Yep, I agree. When we first opened the thermos, it sure smelled strong! However, after we ran the water through it and after making the first (excellent!) pot of coffee, there's none of that left!!!
Everyone is very happy with the coffee and the coffee maker. It's easy to program and it stays hot for a long time in the thermos, especially if you use the 1-4 cup setting.
If you need a coffee maker, look no further!

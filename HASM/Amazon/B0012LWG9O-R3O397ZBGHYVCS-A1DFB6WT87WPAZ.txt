Title: Does anyone remember that this was $59.00 from Apple?
Content:
Okay, I love the iPod shuffle for what it is - compact, almost indestructible, and easy. And I believe that iTunes is the best music player on Mac or PC, and makes it exceptionally easy to manage your music and synch with iPods. But THIS WAS A $59.00 ITEM from Apple. As of this writing, Nov. 18, 2009, you can get them at the Apple Store refurbished, with a full one year warranty, for $39.00. This clown is selling them for $199.99 which is, let me see, almost FOUR TIMES THE ORIGINAL APPLE PRICE. If you are stupid enough to pay that much then PLEASE don't complain that they cost too much. If you don't like the charging dock that comes with it there are several options available on Amazon, starting at about three bucks.
I admit that this is not the best ONLY iPod, but it is certainly an excellent OTHER iPod. Unless you only want an iPod to work out with, in which case this IS the best iPod, and much better than any of its competition.

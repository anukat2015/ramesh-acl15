Title: Good value for price.
Content:
This is a good value for the price.  It's fast, convenientand makes great coffee/espresso.  We particularly like thebuilt in milk steamer.  We also like having the ability tomake coffee and espresso at the same time with one machine.The only criticism is that it has no automatic shut-off.We bought an appliance timer to cover that deficiency.That was the only point that kept us from rating it 5 stars.

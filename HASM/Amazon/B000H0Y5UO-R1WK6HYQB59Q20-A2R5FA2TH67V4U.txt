Title: Loud... WHAT? LOUD!
Content:
My furnace went out this weekend and nobody was open with the part in stock so I went down to the store and picked up one of these babys from a local merchant to get by until Monday.  To be brief, its going back.  I have a Lasko tower unit that was running in the other room about 12 feet away and sitting next to the Lasko I could hear the Bionaire over it.  Just hope I can sleep with it running in my room.

Title: Not Effective
Content:
Don't waste your money on this product.  The thermostat knob is a pain to figure out, and once you do figure it out, the radiator barely warms a 13-by-13 bedroom by a few degrees.  There have even been occasions when the unit has actually cooled down (stopped emitting heat) even though the thermostat knob is set all the way to max.  A monkey could have come up with a better design.

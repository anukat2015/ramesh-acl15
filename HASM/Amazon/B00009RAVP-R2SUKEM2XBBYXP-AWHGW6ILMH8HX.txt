Title: This heater's great!!!
Content:
On those nights you'd rather not crank up the main heat source, yet you're chilled this heaters the best!!!
It oscillates like a fan (no fan in it) with warm radiant heat... warming you and not the whole room.
It has a timer, two heat settings, and can be set to staionary if you're alone in the room. I believe it's
efficiant, no noticable increase in the electric bill. I highly recommend this product.

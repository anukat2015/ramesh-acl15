Title: Great Price, Great Computer!
Content:
I had doubts when I bought this that it would be a good computer. Well, I was wrong. This computer RULES! Why? Let me tell you:
Pros:
- An amazing price ($298 at your local walmart)
- 3GB of ram, which supplies enough power for me to run Photoshop CS4 and Flash CS4 with hardly any trouble
- A 160GB hard drive, which is pretty darn big for a laptop this cheap
- CD/DVD Writer which can write DVDs pretty quickly
- A 2.10 GHz AMD Sempron processor which is very speedy
- A numpad! 
- Wonderful keyboard with BIG keys, which I like a whole bunch
- Doesn't have 32 gazillion special buttons above the keyboard that adjust the volume and stuff(uses the keyboard with the Fn key instead) 
- Really cool first-boot-up program that runs and helps you set up your computer fast and easy
- Great speakers, sounds like my stereo they're so good
- Fantastic touchpad, which I am really impressed with (you can turn it off with the touch of a button)
- Awesome screen! It's a bit reflective, but not like a mirror or anything
- Looooooong power cord with a special velcro doohicky that helps you wrap it up
- There aren't many cons
Cons:
- CD drive seems kinda frail, maybe it's just me 
- Only 3 USB ports
- Arrow keys are kind of scrunchy
- Touchpad buttons are loud(you get used to it :))
So what are you waiting for?? Go buy this awesome computer at your local walmart! :D
*** EDIT ***
Recently this computer's LCD display started flashing when I pulled it out of sleep mode several times in a row. However, after a 30min call to HP tech support they got it fixed! :)
Also, this computer runs Windows 7 Professional like a dream. All my Vista applications work except my program that sets the buttons for my trackball, but I'm to lazy to check if Logitech has a fix yet; they probably do. Just one issue: the processor on this computer (AMD Sempron) does not have virtualization technology, so it can't run XP mode. It's the only processor by AMD that doesn't have virtualization. GRAAAH! D:
One last note: don't buy this computer here - the sellers are FLEECERS! It's only worth $300, not twice that much!
Still a nice computer! :)

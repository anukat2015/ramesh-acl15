Content:
When I brought the Lasko 6450, I thought it suppose to be such a good heater, wrong. This heater are not good at all, it is noisey at high speed and it's more as a fan than a heater. It would work good if you stay in Florida. I wish I had brought another brand. You can't go by reviews, don't know who writes them, the people who brought it or the peole at the comany.

Title: A Superb Product
Content:
First off, I'm not one who is drunk on Apple products or is succumb to trendy things.  The best thing going for Mac computers is OS X.  I'll use Windows in business applications, Linux in programming applications and for personal matters I'll use what is important to me for photos & videos. That is OS X.  At first I thought of getting an inexpensive net book, but its crippled in capability and doesn't have a DVD slot drive.
This 13.3" MacBook Pro has sufficient power for photo and casual video editing.  It has a small foot print that is thin, light weight and very quiet.  True, Apple charges a premium for this laptop, but it is really no more than $200 for what you get. So there is a premium for modern industrial design. 
There are very few laptops like this MacBook Pro which can offer the following for this price and features, namely:
1.  Good resolution 1200 x 800 13.3" display and video card can drive a 30" monitor 2560x1600 at full resolution.
2.  LED back lighting display with a very good color gamut for 13.3" display.
3.  Long life lithium polymer battery, greater than 5 hours, and excellent heat dissipation.
4.  Excellent mouse tracking feature.
5.  1066 MHz front side bus.
6.  High quality construction, fit & finish.
Now tell me if someone can find something comparable in price with a 2.53 GHz processor, or better, and 4 GB of DDR3 RAM?  They can't.  Finally, if you don't like OS X, you can always install Windows on this machine because it's all Intel.
This MacBook Pro has everything I need and will last me a few years.  To all like me who have bought one, disregard the criticisms and enjoy!

Title: So easy, even I can take wonderful pictures !!!!
Content:
Buying the Cannon Rebel XT was an excellent choice for me. I have not yet gotten beyond the tip of the iceberg, to try all the neat stuff this DSLR camera can do. So far I have only used it in automatic mode, and it works very nicely. How can something so easy to use, create such beautiful pictures? I have taken pictures of people to pets to outdoors in nice weather and snow, to my active toddler grandson. The close up of snow flakes after dark,is really cool!!! The timer to "shut off" is a great feature for me, I tend to forget to turn things off. The directions in the book, I would give 4 1/2 stars, had to do a little re-reading to make sense of just a couple minor things. Suggestion: have the camera battery fully charged, CD card in (not included), and then read the book and "play" at the same time. Soon I will be ready to play in the manual mode, Yeah!!!

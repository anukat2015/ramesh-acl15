Title: Best I've had
Content:
I've had a lot of Canon cameras over the years, both film and digital, SLR and compact, and this is undoubedly the best so far. Compared to the Digital Rebel series, the camera feels solid and robust and the results I've had so far, using the EFS 18-55 IS lens, have been excellent. My previous camera was the Digital Rebel Xti and the improvement in image quality over this, using the same lens, is very noticeable, particularly in landscape images where there is a lot of contrast between areas of sunshine and shadow. The wide ISO range is also very impressive, allowing good shots to be taken hand-held in low light.
The controls are very easy to use; I especially like the new Quick Control display and the multi-controller used to navigate it. I like the HDMI output too, which lets me view the pictures as a slideshow in High Definition on my tv. (Money-saving tip: Radio Shack sell a mini-HDMI/HDMI adapter, which allows me to use a standard HDMI cable to connect the camera to the television - much cheaper than Canon's HTC100 cable).
I don't use the Live View option (I'm old-fashioned and prefer to look through the viewfinder) but I can see it could be useful in some circumstances, like close-up photography.
I was thinking of upgrading to the 40D but decided to wait for the 50D to be released and I'm very glad I did. Highly recommended.

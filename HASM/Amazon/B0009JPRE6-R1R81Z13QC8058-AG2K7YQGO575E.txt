Title: It does the job
Content:
I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :).  This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point.  Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP.  I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems.  I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual.

Title: Excellent Heater!
Content:
Great purchase! I use the heater in a large-sized bedroom, free-standing, not wall-mounted.
Pros:
-Keeps the bedroom incredibly warm, even on the economy mode.
-Although lacking a thermostat, it is still easy to keep the temp in the room right where you want it.
-My kittens love curling up in front of it and thus far have not burst into flames. Awesomely pet safe it seems.
-Got it for a good price during the off-season.
-Completely silent, great for cold nights
Cons:
-The back does get hot, but doesn't not seem to radiate a lot of heat. It is simply hot to the touch. Still not sure if I would mount it to a wall.
-There was an initial smell, but having read other reviews and the warning on the heater, I ran it outside for a few hours and it has never caused any odors indoors. 
-Does not warm my soul during the winter of my discontent, but then again was not advertised as a son of York.

Title: Great camera!
Content:
What a great camera!  I've been wanting the digital rebel for a while now and I am so pleased that I waited to get this model.  It takes great photos and is easy to use in the auto mode.  I can't wait to try all of the different manual settings to improve my photos...And I love that this model uses the SD cards, so much better in my opinion that the larger compact flash cards.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take great pics!

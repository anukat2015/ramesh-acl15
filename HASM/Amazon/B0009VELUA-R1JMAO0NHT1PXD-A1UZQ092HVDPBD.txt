Title: A Pretty and Expensive Piece of Junk
Content:
So, how long did it last?  Only eight months.  Unfortunately, I read the negative reviews here AFTER I bought it.  I started using the paper towel trick to stop the leaking down the back of the machine right away; I kept it clean; I bought the expensive extra filters; I used filtered water.  But yesterday, when I turned it on, nada.  After about an hour it finally kicked in.  It did the same thing today, so I'm junking it.  I suppose I could try programming it to start an hour before I get up--but how long will it last like that?  Considering the negative experiences reported by people who have tried to get the manufacturer to make good on the warranty, I don't think it will be worth the hassle.
It was pretty cool at first--great tasting coffee, and I liked the dispenser idea.  But, ultimately, this coffeemaker is a waste of money.  Shame on Cuisinart for not making a better product.  They are obviously relying on their name to sell a substandard product.

Title: Canon EOS Rebel T1i
Content:
Was in a hurry to receive camera so I selected 2-day shipping. Received on time and have no issues with the camera at all.
I'm not sure Amazon wants me to review the camera or the service provided by Amazon. They state I should be specific on things I would have wanted to know before my purchase... so:
My only complaint is that I placed ONE order via Amazon.com that contained 3 items. It was not CLEARLY identifed that one item would be shipped seperately, via a 3rd party provider and that this item would NOT be received within the 2-day shipping that I had selected. What upset me most over this is that I was not informed of this slight delay until I had submitted my order and received an email confirmation. I feel that Amazon.com COULD have coded their program to send a pop-up - during the order process - that CLEARLY informs me that not all items can be shipped within the specific timeframe. This would allow the customer to change the shipping method selected or cancel the order and go to another source. This last option is clearly why Amazon does not address this issue.
In defense of Amazon.com, I did complain and they did refund me $10 towards the shipping charges. I felt this to be fair but I also believe that in today's world, coding to address this is very easy.

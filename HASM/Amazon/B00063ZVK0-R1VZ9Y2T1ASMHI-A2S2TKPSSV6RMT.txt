Title: Great for closed rooms; not so much for large, open rooms.
Content:
With some trepidation, I ordered this product from Amazon despite some of the negative reviews and in my short time spent with the heater, it's been a benefit. I live in a two-story home with an unfinished basement. During the winters (which seem to start in September here) the cost of heating the entire house to a comfortable level can be prohibitively expensive. Space heaters have the benefit of comfortably warming occupied bedrooms without my wasting money warming the unoccupied rooms. The EH1 quickly warms each of the 120-sq. ft. rooms to 75-degrees in just under 30 minutes and maintains that temperature for as long as the unit is turned on. The unit's thermostat can be set as high as 90-degrees and the three available modes are fan, high, and low. The low setting has been adequate for all of my needs so far, but in my largest room, we found the need to use the high setting to see an appreciable increase in temperature. From my experience, poorly insulated rooms that are larger than 160-sq. ft. will be too much for the EH1 to handle, but it performs admirably otherwise. The "Vortex" moniker is misleading as, unlike Vornado fans for instance, the EH1 does not move a lot of air, even at high settings. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the EH1 doesn't break down on me anytime soon and I'm hoping that keeping it free of dust will prolong its life.

Title: Save your money - I'm on my 3rd dead one... DO NOT BUY
Content:
First unit - dead after 6 months (lights come on - no heat)
replacement - huge dent in back panel on arrival (box perfect... they sent it that way!)
second replacement - OK for a few months. Tried it as the weather got colder this month. Worked once, now won't heat up.
Customer service says the warranty starts (and ends) based on the original purchase date, so I'm out of luck.

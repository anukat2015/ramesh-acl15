Title: Absolutely Love this Product!!!!
Content:
Does everything Toshiba advertises!  I also had many,many specialized utilities - and all have run under 64-bit Win 7.  Buying a pre-packaged/integrated system sure was much easier than getting the desktop I built afterwards online ...  Not cheap - but great/fast shipping, great system stability and operaiton.  Can't comment on the value of the warranty as I have not used it ... and I am a VERY heavy usenet user - frequently downloading 24x7 several days per week!  Even the sound system is adequate in this laptop - which is big and heavy - but very easy to read (large screen) and the fastest laptop I have ever seen!  If you can afford it - highly recommended.  As a 56 year old electronics engineer - computing over 30 years - I am very impressed with this Toshiba product.

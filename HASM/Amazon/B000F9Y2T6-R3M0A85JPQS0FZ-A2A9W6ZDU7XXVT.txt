Title: Convenient and Light!
Content:
I used to have the Hoover Floor Mate and one day it fell apart.  When I bought it, it was pretty expensive so I decided not to replace it and went back to regular Quickie mops.  I always hated rubbing dirty water around and the mop heads kept disintegrating so I started to think maybe I wanted another Floor Mate.  I was walking through Target and saw the Flip It and thought it looked nice and compact so I came home and started researching on line.
I decided to get the 7340 Flip-It with Optional Heater.  What I really like about it is that it is lightweight and compact.  You will need to be careful when you aren't using it that you stand it up so it doesn't tip -- just one of the side effects of having such a lightweight hardfloor cleaner.
I have a lot of ceramic tiles in my house and I find it much more convenient to use this than the Quickie.  It dries the floor as I go so when the kids and dog come in, they aren't tracking across a wet floor.  Yes, it sometimes leaves a little pool of water, but I just wipe that up with a rag -- not a problem for me.
In my opinion, it does a pretty good job. The Flip-It is definitely better than using a Quickie mop and not as much work as getting down on my knees with a scrub brush.  I find it a happy medium.  Good enough and not back breaking work!  Also, because it is fairly small, it stores in a smaller space than my old Floor Mate which is an asset.

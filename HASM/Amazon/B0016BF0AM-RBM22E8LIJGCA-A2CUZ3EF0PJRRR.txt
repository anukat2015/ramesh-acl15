Title: all around not very good
Content:
At first I was excited at the thought of how easy it would be to put songs on and take them off because it just goes into the USB port. I used it once and it worked ok, and then the next day it froze and now forever displays the single phrase "MP3 Player" and does nothing else. I talked to Centon and waited and then about 2 weeks later they finally sent me a permission number to take it back.. but since I have to pay for shipping to send it back it will be almost half of the original price.. so the bottom line is don't order this it is not worth the trouble. I am never buying something from Centon again.

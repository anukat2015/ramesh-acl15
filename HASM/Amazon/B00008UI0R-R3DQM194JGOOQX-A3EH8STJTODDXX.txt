Title: Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vac
Content:
I couldn't be happier with this vacuum. I have 9, yes 9, dogs and a house with pine floors. This vacuum is so light and easy to move around that it is not inconvenient to vacuum every day. The cord is long enough that I don't have to unplug and move it very often. I love the on/off switch and suction control being on the wand, not on the base unit. The wand telescopes very easily to use for dusting. I have not tried the carpet attachment since I have no carpet, but it looks to be a very well made, sturdy unit. Because of its compact size, it will also be excellent for taking out and vacuuming my car. I really can't think of anything negative to say. If I could change anything it would be a larger capacity dirt container, but I can live with it the way it is.

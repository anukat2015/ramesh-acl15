Title: Not bad, but best for very small rooms
Content:
I purchased this space heater a month or so ago to help heat my apartment.  I have two large rooms with high ceilings, each of which has a wall unit on one end of the room, but the warm air doesn't get very far.  I hoped this space heater could be placed on the opposite end of the room to supplement the heat.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is lightweight and easily carried from room to room.  It is also fairly quiet and heats up quickly.  There have been no safety issues (sparking, hot cords) so far. However, it doesn't produce very much heat and during oscillation the air only blows left to right and not upwards.  I think this heater would be fine for a small room with low ceilings (as a back up heat source) or an office, but it isn't effective for larger rooms, even as a backup heater.  There is a temperature control with an automatic shut off once it reaches the set temperature, but only two settings, which I never seem to reach.  I never use the remote as I usually have this right next to me.

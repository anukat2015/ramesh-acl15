Title: the best compromise
Content:
This camera is, in my opinion, the best Nikon compromise just now between high performance and price. It is not a professional camera, but has on-board electronics that are virtually of professional level. The quality of the pictures is superb, and the camera is extremely versatile: one can just aim and shoot, without any worry for complicated settings, but one can also fully personalize the camera to his or her own wishes if one likes.
The lens is also very good, and covers most of the everyday needs of an amateur photographer. 
I am very satisfied indeed with it!

Title: Nikon D90 18-105 kit
Content:
Coming from top of the line u4/3 camera I must say that overall I am happy with my choice of D90. It does not come to replace my existing compact (Panasonic LX3) and u43 camera (Panasonic GH1) but rather to add/complete the capabilities those cameras are lacking.
This is just an initial impression after a few weeks of advanced amature use. D90 - even with the kit lens - provides significantly better low light capabilities, flash photography (even with the simple SB-400 it wipes the floor with GH1/FL36 combo), kids (camera is much more responsive) and sports (same reason). Going beyond the kit lens, Nikon today has a very decent line of DX prosumer lenses which are usually cheaper compared to similar lens in u43 world. I can highly recommend 35mm/1.8 prime (200$) and 70-300 VR telephoto. 
Ergonomically D90 is better compared to GH1, with more controls available through dedicated buttons on the camera body. The controls lay out works well for me too.
Build quality of D90 body is reasonable. My only complaint so far is related to the fact that D90 has already developed a bright red hot pixel visible at ISO 400 and above. Kit lens build and feel is indeed cheapo (many reviewes mention this) but image quality is surprisingly good for a consumer lens, and taking its price into consideration the price/performance ratio is great.
D90 video capability is a joke compared to GH1. Focusing speed in live view (CDAF) is slower than 50$ compact.
At the end of the day, pretty much in line with what I expected, D90 excells in specialized usages I mentioned above, but GH1 will continue to serve as general purpose/travel kit thanks to it portability, articulated display, video capabilities and reasonable stills quality.

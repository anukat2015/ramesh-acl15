Title: It's grown on me
Content:
If I had rated this when it first arrived, it would have been a three star item.  After having warm feet for a while, four stars seems reasonable as there really is only one negative to the Vornado SoleAire.  That negative - the fan in the heater is much louder than it needs to be.  My computer sits on top of the desk (away from dust bunnies) and is MUCH quieter than the SoleAire sitting under the desk despite the computer having 6 fans and multiple hard drives running all the time.  If Vornado had chosen a slightly larger, slower running blower fan, the SoleAire could have been very nearly silent.  At least the noise from their smaller, faster fan is white noise instead of mechanical racket.
I've not used the SoleAire on the fan only mode since it's still chilly but if you are not warm enough sitting at your desk, you should give this product a try (especially if you can get it for half price - that's where it really shines).

Title: Great A/C, Truly powerful
Content:
I have bought two of these units for my work, and they are currently pumping away full blast in the hot New York summer. They are most likely close to their rated BTU/hr (10,000 for the older ones, 12k for the current model). They are keeping close to 2,000 square feet (with 14' ceilings) cool as I write this.
On their third summer of use, I really have nothing bad to say about these units, so here is the good stuff:
*The remote is RF, so it works through walls, and snaps nicely on the top of the unit.
*Powerful cooling, unlike a lot of other portable units that don't even come close to their rating.
*Dual duct system might seem awkward, but using fresh air across the condenser coil improves efficiency and power.
*Condensate is vented through the exhaust, unless you turn on de-humidify mode, in which case you can hook up a hose or empty the tank.
*Options of HAF/Charcoal filter which is easy to install.
*Solid Japanese construction.
*Really good quality hoses that hold their shape when you bend them.
*Nice PVC window mount system with grates and caps included.
In the city these ran around $600-$700, they are currently $449 direct from Toyotomi.
Would definitely recommend as the best portable AC after a lot of research.

Title: Nice Bird Heater
Content:
Bought for my bird.  $40 cheaper than a similar heater marketed for birds.  Raises cage temp a couple of degrees, provides nice radiant heat to back of cage.  Seems very well constructed.  Perfect if you like to keep your house a little cooler than bird likes.  If you want to heat a room, this won't work!  The stand fits and grips the panel well, and is very sturdy.

Title: very pleased
Content:
i just got my capresso 465.05 machine a few days ago. i didn't buy it from amazon b/c it wasn't in stock yet, but i wanted to review it here as i always use these in my research. i have been very pleased with my machine so far. i ran plain water through the machine first, and then brewed the first pot of coffee using the coarsest grind setting, as the directions recommend. i have to say, the first pot wasn't amazing, but the two i have brewed after adjusting the grind to the mid-range setting have been really great. i am only brewing 4 cups at a time, enough for me and my roommate to drink in the morning, but the coffee is totally flavorful, strong, and not bitter in the least. i really like the feel of the grinder, it seems SO much better quality than my old blade grinder. i have had no problems with coffee strength, or grinder, or the ground beans getting to the basket. in addition, while some people might like their coffee warmer, i like it to be drinkable right out of the machine, so for me it is a plus that the thermal carafe cools the coffee enough for it to still be hot but not scalding at first pour. overall, i am happy with my machine and enjoying using it.

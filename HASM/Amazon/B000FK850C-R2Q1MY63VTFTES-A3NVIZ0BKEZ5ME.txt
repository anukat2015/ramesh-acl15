Title: Loved it for 8 hours until it broke.
Content:
Setup was very easy and we liked the versatility of being able to use this as a heater or fan, depending on season.  This was bought to supplement the radiators in our drafty old duplex.  
We used it for 4 hours the night we got it and it did a good job of warming our living room and bedroom (we moved it between the two).  Same story the next night except at some point after we went to bed it made a loud beep and the screen lit up with a bunch of nonsense.  We did the reset procedure and unplugged, but on start up the next night it did the same thing.  It's going back to Amazon and we'll be trying a different heater.

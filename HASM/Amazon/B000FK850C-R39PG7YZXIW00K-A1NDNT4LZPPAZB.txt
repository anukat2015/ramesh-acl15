Title: not the best
Content:
I got this heater 3 years ago and it decided to die yesterday in the middle of winter.  It warms the room relatively well, but is very noisy especially when you're trying to sleep.  The display panel is a bright blue light, which is very distracting at night.  I wouldn't buy it again.

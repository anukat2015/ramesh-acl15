Title: Had High Hopes!
Content:
After reading countless reviews and fighting with the wife about what camera we should buy to replace a 3yr+ Old Canon 5Mp Powershot 610 we decieded on the Rebel EOS XSi. This camera turned out to be terrible in numerous apspects. Auto-focus is next to useless. Nothing seemed to be in focus, even pics taken with our old Powershot 610 were better indoors and out. Flash is worse then a candle for typical lite rooms. Expect to have to buy an add on flash with any of these DLSR the image processors just dont work with adundant light just like camcorders. Pictures were either under or overexposed and sometimes the flash wouldnt even go off. The camera grip is aweful and you constantly either cover the red eye reducer or the flash with your hand while trying to hold it. Even my wife who has small hands had a hard time holding it. The auto-focus issue seems to be a recurring issue with the this camera for months now after reading reviews. These entry DSLR dont seem to be living up to the expectations one would expect for a $700+ camera plus lenses and accessories.

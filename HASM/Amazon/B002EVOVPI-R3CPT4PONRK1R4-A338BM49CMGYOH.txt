Title: Great coffee maker great service
Content:
This is my first review but I'm taking the time to express how impressed I am with this product and the company.  I bought the coffee maker/burr grinder combo because of my annoyance with grinding beans that get all over the place.  This coffee maker grinder/combo works wonderfully.  Put the beans in, set the grind setting, and there you go.  The consistency of the grind is awesome!  I have it set to grind the finest with a mix of esspresso and columbian beans with no clogging problems at all for over a month now.  I was wary because I had heard gripes about how loud the grinder is but I really found it to be quieter than my previous stand alone Cappresso grinder which cost $60 alone.  I get up at 0400 and it doesn't wake up the rest of the house.  The best part was the customer service.  After a couple of days, I noticed that the clock appeared to be off.  I measured it over several days and it ended up that the digital clock ran fast which messed up the programmed time I wanted coffee in the morning.  I was worried that it would be a pain to return since I bought it on the internet and return or repair would be a hassel.  When I called the 800 number for Capresso in the manual and told them my story they sent me out a replacement unit (without even requiring proof or info that I purchased the unit from a third party).  The new unit arrived with return UPS label (I didn't need to pay for shipping for the new unit or return) and it works great!
I recommend this purchase whole heartedly.  If your looking at this machine because you want great fresh coffee with NO mess and NO worries, this is the machine and the company for you!

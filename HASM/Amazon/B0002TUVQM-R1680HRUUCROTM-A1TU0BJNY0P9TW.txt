Title: JUNK!
Content:
They don't make things like they use to.  Does that sound familiar?  I purchased this a year ago and it does make great lattes' however the handle broke and it's impossible to fix.  Just recently I purchased the same brand, with "new" features.  It lasted two weeks and the same handle broke again.
There are not many if any lower priced latte machines, but if you want to take a chance on this for $30, maybe you can get a year or so out of it.

Title: George@woodjig.com.  Has served the shop well!
Content:
This a very good heater for the shop!  It runs for a long time on one tank of propane. It is a nice heater to at least break the chill in  very cold weather or a large shop or area.  It can be a valuable back up in case of any problems with your primary source of heat too.  Highly recommended and a great price here!

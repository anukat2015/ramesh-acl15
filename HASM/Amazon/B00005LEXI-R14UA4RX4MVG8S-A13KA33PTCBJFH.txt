Title: Buddy heater
Content:
A buddy of mine recently purchased this item. It is light weight and very portable. If you are using it in an enclosed area, I recommend getting the hose adapter and using a refillable bottle to save on costs. The only drawback I have noticed is outside on windy days. I am purchasing one to use in the shop. While it will not make a large area &quot;toasty&quot;, it will take the chill out of the work area.

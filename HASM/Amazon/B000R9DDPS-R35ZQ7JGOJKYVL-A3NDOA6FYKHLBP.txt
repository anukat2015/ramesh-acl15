Title: New Release of Toughbook 74
Content:
Pasasonic has just recently refreshed the Toughbook 74. The new version comes standard with 2GB RAM and a 160GB hard disk drive. It can be researched at www.groupmobile.com.
The CF-74 is the perfect sized ruggedized laptop. It has a 13.3" display, which is large enough to provide an easy to read screen but small enough as to fit on an airplane pull-down tray or not get in the way when mounted in a vehicle. And the refreshed version is plenty powerful.

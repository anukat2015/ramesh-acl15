Title: Cool concept but you get shafted
Content:
This is actually a nice tablet. The build quality is good and the features are impressive, but after using it I realized my much older notebook performs better. 
I got this to be a car pc, after shopping around I decided the HP was the best tablet to get. The touch screen is good and allows for finger manipulation. But the processor sucks, the battery life stinks, and multitasking is so so. Trying to justify the cost when I already have a 2.5 year old 14" notebook the out performs it is hard. 
So if you need a tablet, and don't have a computer of any kind then sure buy it, other than that it's a waste of money. HP should have used a better processor and chipset. It would have made this a must have.

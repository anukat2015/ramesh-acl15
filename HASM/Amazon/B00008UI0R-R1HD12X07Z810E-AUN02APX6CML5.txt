Title: good enough to inspire me to write a review
Content:
I have never written a review before, but i read so many when i was shopping for this vacuum that i felt like i should give something back.  I am a huge fan of the vacuum in general.  I vaccum every day pretty much.  My husband said he was glad he liked the way this one looked, because he knew he'd have to look at it in the corner all the time.  Anyway, this vacuum is just great.  The suction is amazing.  I had an Electrolux before, and I thought it did a good job, but the day I got this one, I filled up the canister about 3 times. We have mostly hardwood floors, so I was amazed that it picked that much up off what looked like a fairly clean floor.  It made my area rugs look so much better. The attachments are great, and I especially love the little mini spinning head that cleans pet hair off of furniture. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that I feel like it's a little clunky.  The metal wand and head are really heavy.  This is probably why it works so well though, so it's really not a flaw.   The cord winds so fast, you have to be careful or you'll whack yourself in the legs.  And it's also really loud compared to my Electrolux.  All that said, this is a great vacuum, and it's very affordable for what you get.  I highly recommend.

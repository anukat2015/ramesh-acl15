Title: Who designed this
Content:
This was a great idea but the design stinks. First off the arm band holder does not fit the mp3 player correctly. There are holes in the side of the holder and the only thing that lines up correctly is the head phone jack. The controls are not easily accessible when in the armband and the hold button lock on when inserted and is hidden when in the armband. It comes with some weird head phones that have a string connecting the two ear buds. I've never seen something like this and not sure if your supposed to wear the them with the wire in front, behind or around you neck. The head phone jack is not a standard size so they did include a clunky adapter if you wanted to use one of your own. The usb jack is non standard also with a 6 inch cord. This was my first clue that this device was suspect when they used a proprietary 4 pin usb connection. The device does not play all of my mp3 files instead giving an error Invalid Format. My sansa mp3 player had no problem with these files. It is very very hard and confusing to use. There is a rocker button on top that controls most of it but very hard to and not intuitive to navigate. This device instead has a RECord button on the front of it. Why would you want to record with an athletic mp3 player? They should have made better use of this button for something else. The only good thing about this product is that it can record fm radio to a wav file. If you buy this be ready to be confused.

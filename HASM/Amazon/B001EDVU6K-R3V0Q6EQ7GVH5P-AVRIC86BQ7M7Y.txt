Title: Great little heater for bedrooms! Easy to use.
Content:
This is a great little heater for our bedroom (approx 350 sq feet).  Our bedroom sits above our unheated garage so it can get quiite cold and quite expensive to heat the entire house in the winter.  We saved on our energy bills by using this heater to just the bedroom at bedtime.  It is easy to program and the noise is tolerable (takes some time to get used to).

Title: nice ac
Content:
Ordered this from [...]. I was a little bit skeptical on this because of the two 1 star reviews here, but living in a west-facing, top floor, and bad ventilation apt in 95+ degrees, I have no other choices. Probably I am "lucky", I have mine working fine out of the box. The installation steps are straight forward. It took me about 30 min to have it start blowing ice cold air. Given the outdoor temp is around 95, I am more than happy to see it cools down my bedroom to 80-85 in 1 hr. Yes it is loud and heavy, but that is what an AC supposed to be, right? And it does its job. The only complain from me is that the swing slider on the fan does not affect the aire direction that much. But anyway, with this little monster I can have a good sleep tonight. I have already recommended it to one of my friends.5 star.

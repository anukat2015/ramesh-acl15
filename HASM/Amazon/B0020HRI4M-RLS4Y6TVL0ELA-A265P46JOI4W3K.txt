Title: All-in-all very good laptop
Content:
I got this laptop about 6 hours ago and I have to say, after inspecting and playing with it, I really like this laptop. Sure the frame could be more solid and the because of the 16:9 widescreen, it looks smaller then I imagined a 17.3 inch to look like, but I still really like it. 
Now for a couple of bad points. The battery life is awful. I unplugged it and in 10 minutes, the battery went down to 94%, with power-saver ON. It doesn't click closed, it's kind-of like folding a piece of cardboard in half and calling it closed. Right now I find no more negitives.
I love the quad-core. Love the 4gb of mem and the room to add 4 more. Powerful videocard. I love it. I will review more in 2 months and share how it's going.

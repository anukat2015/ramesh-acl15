Title: Love this camera
Content:
I bought this back in 2005 when it was under a grand including two lens that comes with this stuff, funny how the price doubled considering how you can purchase the higher end model for the same price.  I like the quick reloading time, this camera can also use the Nikon SB 600 flash, which is great for extra lighting and creative lighting techniques like bounce flah to give a more natural lighting.  If you look at SB 600, it says it's for D 70 models but you can use it on this model also.

Title: Very nice overall, but missing a little polish.
Content:
Everything works great, programming is easy, etc.
2 gripes:
1. The faceplate doesn't always fit very well and needs to be forced a bit to attach securely to the wall mount.
2. The batteries are very conveniently placed so you don't have to remove the face plate to change them, but they aren't held in place strongly and at the slightest shake can be disturbed sufficiently enough to dislodge them for the instant it takes for the unit to lose all your programming.  (This happened to me after I had the faceplate off for programming (as suggested by the manual) and then was trying desperately to attach it to the wall.)

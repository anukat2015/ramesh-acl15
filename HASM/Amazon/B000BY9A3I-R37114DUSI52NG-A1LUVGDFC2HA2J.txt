Title: Very Good Canister Vaccum
Content:
I have mostly hardwood floors and a little carpet and not a lot of space to store a bulky vacuum cleaner. It was difficult to find a model that would transition easily between wood and carpet. This model is excellent on the hardwood and tile floors, but it is not the greatest on the carpet. The suction is great and easily adjusted from the handle. It is easy to dump the dirt from the bagless collection area. It is a little small, so if fills up fast. The only other issue I have with this is that the cord is very short - so you have to keep replugging it in all over the house. Otherwise, a very lightweight, nicely designed vacuum. I am very pleased with it.

Title: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!
Content:
If you value your time, then this vacuum cleaner is not for you. During the first few months, it worked fine, then came the issues. Here are the problems. 1) It gets clogged WAY too easily. Almost every time I used this, something gets clogged in the tubing, and I have to manually remove it, since the vacuum stops working when anything gets clogged. What it comes down to is that the motor is just not powerful enough to suck up all the debris and it just gets trapped in the tubing. 2) Cleaning the dust pan causes such a big mess that after each time, you need to spend extra time cleaning the dust and debris that gets all over the place. 3) Filters are expensive, you might as well get bagged vacuum. 4) Has no power! 5) Heavy. 
I can't think of anything good about this vacuum. My toddler spilled about 1/4 cup of rice grains all over the floor. I made the mistake of pulling out this vacuum to clean up the mess. I KID YOU NOT, IT TOOK ME ABOUT AN HOUR! First, I had to remove the clog from the last vacuuming session, Second, I had to clean up all the dust and debris that flew all over the place from removing the clogs. Then I had to go over the same spot over and over again, and even after vacuuming the same spot 5-6 times, there were rice grains. Instead of sucking it up, it would kind of push the grains away from the vacuum. Then I wanted to vacuum the rice from tight spots, so I removed the hose. Big mistake, the vacuum was so weak that it couldn't properly suction the rice grains into the dust pan, so it got trapped in the hose, and it of course spilled all over the place again. It would've been a lot faster if I just used a broom. BISSELL, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR PRODUCT EVER AGAIN!

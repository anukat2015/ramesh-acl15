Title: Lots of hard to get to features
Content:
The reason that I bought this player is that it has a built in FM transmitter and many other features. I thought that this would be perfect for road trips. The main problem that I have with this unit is that it is for me almost impossible to get to any of the adjustments while I am driving. The touch screen menus are very challenging for me to see and touch. I would much prefer actual buttons so that I easily change the FM settings. I have big fingers, and it was almost impossible for me to accurately touch the part of the screen that I needed. 
My unit came with a defective USB cable. My unit would lose its time and date settings.
I returned this product. It just is not right for me. I should have just gone ahead and purchased an IPOD, but I thought I could get more for my money with the Latte Espresso.

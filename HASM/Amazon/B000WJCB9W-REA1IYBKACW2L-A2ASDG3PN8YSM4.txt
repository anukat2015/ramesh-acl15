Title: Great little player
Content:
I bought two of these players (a blue one for me & the red for my husband). I think they're terrific -- much smaller than I expected, but great sound & definitely user-friendly. I'm kind of a technophobe, but it was so easy to sync with music I had downloaded from amazon & from CDs we already own. We used them this past week on a long flight & they worked perfectly & were a real lifesaver from having to listen to a crying baby on the plane. I highly recommend!

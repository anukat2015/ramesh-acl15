Title: Great Thermal Coffee Maker...BUT
Content:
Capresso MT600 10-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Stainless-Steel Thermal Carafe
Great design, especially the large mouth on carafe which makes cleaning easy. The MT600 makes great hot coffee and the thermal pot keeps it warm for hours. I liked my Capresso MT500 which I used previous to purchasing the MT600. 
However, I am disappointed with this product. Looking beyond the lovely design, it lacks quality details. The construction of Capresso MT600 (made in China) is inferior to the MT500 (made in Portugal) which I owned and used for 7 years prior to purchasing this coffee maker. The unit is not as solid, the lid to water reservoir is wobbly, and the water reservoir has a groove on the left side instead of a nice clean sleek left side of the MT500. The carafe's lid is difficult to turn but I like the larger mouth for easy cleaning (about the only improvement I can detect). The water indicator on the right is hard to see unless you turn the coffee maker. I could see the water indicator level on the MT500 without turning the unit. The MT600's water level indicator can only be read by turning the maker to the side and viewing it straight on. Basically...the MT600 is a cheap imitation of the MT500. I expected to receive a quality built product from Capresso. 
Upon receiving my coffee maker, I called Capresso Customer Service and was told that my unit was fine but it had a wobbly water reservoir lid. I was told the MT600 was more affordable than the MT500 and the manufacturer site had changed.  I do not mind paying more for quality well designed and crafted product which I used every day. I will now be on the lookout for another coffee maker which has a solid feel and nice design.

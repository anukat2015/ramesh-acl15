Title: E-500 Kit
Content:
After having the camera for over a year, I am still amazed at the quality of the pictures the camera will produce when used correctly.  I will say it was a learning curve to understand some of the features, but well worth the time spent on them.  Camera have worked flawlessly since first out of the box.  I have added a 55-200mm Sigma lens and FL-30 flash with great results on both.  I think the camera never got the same reviews as the Nikon and Canon SLR's have received, though I would match picture for picture with any SLR in it's category range.  Highly recommend the Olympus camera's, I have bought 4 of them since 1999, all still working.

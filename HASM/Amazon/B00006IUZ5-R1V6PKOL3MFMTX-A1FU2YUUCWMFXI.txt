Title: Permanently out on our counter
Content:
This is truth in advertising!  There's no promise that it will cook wonderful meals or make you thinner, stronger, or faster.  The Hot Shot will only heat water quickly for you.  It does that well, and very reliably.  If only other products had such truth in their advertising!  The Hot Shot stays on our counter and even in near 100 degree weather, it is used several times a week.  We know that we could live without it, but why would we want to?  It works very well for us.

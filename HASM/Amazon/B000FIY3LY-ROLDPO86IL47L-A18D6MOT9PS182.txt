Title: Amcor portable A/C with heater
Content:
Purchased a PLM14000-BTU A/C heat unit.
The A/C compressor did not come on.(no cold air) Called Amcor and was told there was nothing wrong with it. "Turn it on and wait for ten minutes" and it would come on. After several ten minute tries, it still did not work.
After three calls to Amcor customer service, I received a case ID number and was told that they would ship me a new one the next day. Ten days later, still no A/C
I called again,and was told that it was not shipped but they did not know why.They would look into it and let me know.A week later, still no responce from Amcor!
Called (6th time)after four weeks and was told they still didn't know why it has not been shiped
At this time, I do not want the unit nor do I want to do any business with Amcor.

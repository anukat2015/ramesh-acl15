Title: Zune HD-The Anti-Face-Palm
Content:
I have owned a Zune since the beginning. I started with a 30 GB brick to a 16 GB to this 16 GB HD. I am completely blown away with the device. I had high expectations for it and I was still impressed. It is a very good size with terrific clarity. The Zune software is more user friendly than iTunes, but still retains a learning curve if you are not used to it. I absolutely love everything about it. This is the iPod killer!

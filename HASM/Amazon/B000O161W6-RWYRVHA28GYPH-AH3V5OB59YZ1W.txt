Title: Excellent value!
Content:
I bought this camera with the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 lens for casual and street photography.  My studio & portrait camera is a D300 with fast glass, which give me outstanding quality but lots of bulk and weight.  The D40x is small and light and I carry it with me everywhere.  Photo quality is excellent for the price!
Pros: size, usability, image quality, LCD
Cons: Tends to overexpose, only autofocus with AF-S lenses, AF is primitive.
I recommend this camera to beginners and serious Nikon photographers that want the convenience of a small package to carry everywhere.

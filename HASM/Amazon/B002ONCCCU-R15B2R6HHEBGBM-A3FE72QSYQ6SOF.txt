Title: Great Computer for Great Price
Content:
I have this computer for a few months now and it has work perfectly.  Runs fast and has all the memory you need for small personal computer replacement.  Was able to take advantage of amazon's lightening deal and save a bundle.  The whole family has used this computer and we have had no problems.  I like the battery power that doesn't dim the screen if you don't have it plug'd in.  Battery life is ok at 2-3 hours for mainly general use.
I would recommend this computer.

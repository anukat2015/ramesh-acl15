Title: Missing Charcoal filter
Content:
This Coffee Maker was received in a flimsy box, and I was surprised nothing was broken, I received the case to fit the charcoal filter, but did not receive the filter itself, so I called Cuisinart, since it is under waranty as a reconditioned model, mentioned the filter was missing, well, this is something they do not replace and I had to buy it, and extra cost which I should not have had to pay for

Title: This Braun make a strong, hot, cup of coffee
Content:
Have been using the Braun KF590 for two weeks now and have been very pleased. The coffeemaker looks sleek, takes up very little counter space and is easy to program. The cup markings on the side of the water tank are easy to read and are helpful when adding water to the tank. As with most coffee pots, this one does not really make ten cups of coffee since the average coffee mug is larger than four ounces. When making a pot for two people (two large mugs per person), I typically use nine scoops of dark roast ground coffee and add nine cups of water.  It takes about ten minutes to brew and the coffee comes out strong and very hot. The filter basket is easy to open and remove for filling and/or cleaning. I am currently using the water filter that came with the pot but really don't notice any difference in the coffee flavor with the filter. Also, I prefer to use the #4 paper filter instead of the reusable mesh filter.  I have not experienced any problem with spillage during pouring although you may want to pour a little slower when you are down to the last cup. This Braun so far is performing perfectly and hopefully will continue to do so for several more years.

Title: Better after a few weeks of use
Content:
I too found this machine to make rather weak coffee, even with plenty of beans and the use of the 1-5 cup setting. However, after 3 weeks of daily use, the coffee is stronger and more full-bodied (for reasons I can't really be sure of). And I have not used different coffee beans or more of them. I'll chalk it up to the machine being "seasoned" now. I was thinking I might need to return it,  but the coffee it now makes is quite good.
There are more pieces to clean, but really, it's a minute or two. And the grinder is noisy, but what grinder isn't?

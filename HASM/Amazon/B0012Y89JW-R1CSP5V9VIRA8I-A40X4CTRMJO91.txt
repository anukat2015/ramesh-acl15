Title: Just perfect.
Content:
The best camera I ever owned. This camera was purchased to take pictures of my 10th grandchild. It was supposed to be used by Grandmother but I never let it out of my hands. Very easy to use and records digital images very quickly so what you see is usually what you get. The kit lens 18-55 is just about right. Very good battery life. The viewfinder is just about perfect. For pictures within 20 feet of the subject I have to make a visual correction to locate the subject slightly higher in the viewfinder. However the image is recorded and so quickly reviewed that I have time to repeat the recording.

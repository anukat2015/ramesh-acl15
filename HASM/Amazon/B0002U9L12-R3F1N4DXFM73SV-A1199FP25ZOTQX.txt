Title: Not for anyone with arthritis in their hands
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for about 6 months now and I think I've decided that I just don't like it.  I have the beginnings of arthritis in my hands and trying to open the carafe first thing in the morning when my hands are still a bit stiff is a real challenge.  To keep the coffee hot the lid has to be on pretty tight and I find it very difficult to open.  I too have had the problem with the filter falling over and getting the pot full of grounds.  I guess if it weren't for the difficult lid I might spring for a permanent filter but I think I'll just get another machine.

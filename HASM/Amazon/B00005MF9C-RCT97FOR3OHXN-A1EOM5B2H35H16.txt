Title: Great when you don't want to brew a whole pot!
Content:
I live with people who enjoy really watered-down coffee...definitely not my taste. So I asked my brother to get me this as a gift, and it works great! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because the mug provided really doesn't do much except collect the coffee -- I have a larger stainless steel mug which I pour straight from the mug provided (as the mug provided really doesn't keep liquids hot for any length of time). Cleanup is quick and easy. Usually I just run the filter, basket and mug under cold water, and its ready for my next mug of coffee. The coffee came out fresh-tasting, exactly as it should be. Definitely a good buy if a) you are the only coffee drinker of your household, or b) only need a small amount to get you through the morning.

Title: pc homeboys, shut your yap
Content:
You got to hand it to apple.  they continue to put out superior products and semi-affordable prices.  the ipod is no exception.  i have tried most of the "competing" mp3 players everyone talks about, and they are mostly wrong.  It is like a kia going up against a mercedes.  the quality and looks just dont compare.  so what if it cant take WMA, windows didnt make it did they?  if you weren't so impatient, you would just convert the songs to AAC, which i think is way better.  The battery isn't easily replaced because if it were, it wouldn't be as well protected, and the ipod it self would be a lot larger.  finally, it doesn't come with the dock, a case, or an fm tuner because there are plenty out there.  Apple just wants you to choose which one you like best.  
The pc era is ending, and apple is taking over.  it is like the fall of EA sports, the new york yankees, and the jersey devils.

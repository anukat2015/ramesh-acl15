Title: Don't buy this vacuum.
Content:
While it gets the cat hair off our rugs very well, this is where my happiness with this vacuum ends.  The suction when the rotating brush is off (hardwood floor setting) is terrible.  I frequently have to go over the same spot multiple times before it will pick up the smallest piece of fluff.  Where the hose attaches into the body of the vac does not rotate and I am therefor forced to untwist the hose frequently.  I think the thing that irritates me the most, though, is the bag.  I had to change it after just 5 uses.  I would not recommend buying this product.

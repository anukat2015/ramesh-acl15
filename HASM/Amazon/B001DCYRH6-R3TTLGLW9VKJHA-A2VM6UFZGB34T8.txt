Title: Vacuum not good if you have small children
Content:
I bought this vacuum due largely to the good reviews seen on Amazon.  When I got it, I was surprised to find that there are no wheels on it and you are supposed to carry it on your shoulder.  A few weeks ago my two year old sneaked behind me while I was vacuuming and the vacuum (which was hanging off of my shoulder) knocked him in the forehead leaving a good bruise.  I tried calling Plexsupply which is the company that shipped it to me and they won't let me return it because it is after their 30 day return policy.  I do not recommend using this vacuum or the company Plexsupply.

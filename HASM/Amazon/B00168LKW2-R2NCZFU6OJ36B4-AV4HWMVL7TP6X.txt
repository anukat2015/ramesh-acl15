Title: This thing blows... COLD!!
Content:
After puchasing 3 like A/C units, trying them out, then returning them...  I found the DeLonghi.  I was reluctant to purchase it due to the fact that it was much more expensive than the rest AND from a company I had never heard of!  The salesperson at Lowes explained to me that several other people like myself had done the same thing I was doing (Purchased cheapies then returned em') to then spring for the DeLonghi.  To his knowledge, he said, none of those customers returned the DeLonghi.  So, I was sold.  Anywho, After my first outrageous power bill #I ran the thing day and night, don't do that!!  Oh was it great though, to be snuggled in blankets when its 115 outside...# I learned to use this A/C in moderation.  Keeps the master bed, bath and hallway at 74 degrees, 115+ outside...

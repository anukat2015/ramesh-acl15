Title: Great Small Heater
Content:
This heater does just what it was built to do, puts out a little warmth while using a little bit of electricity. It draws about 300 watts, which is about 1/3 to 1/5th what most heaters use. Since electric heaters are all 100% efficient, you just get less heat from this one, so it won't heat a big room. I have three of these so that we can lower the house temp and still be comfortable while sitting at the computer or watching TV. If you pay $0.10 cents per killowatt for your power, this heater will only cost you about 3 cents per hour to run. One arrived with a cracked element support, but Amazon relaced it quickly and paid for the return of the defective unit.

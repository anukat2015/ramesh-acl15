Title: Great coffee but major design flaws that will infuriate you.
Content:
Carafe does NOT fit under the filter cone with the cap screwed on as the photo shows. This is a MAJOR problem. You cannot store carafe inserted into the machine. Made of plastic parts which will create a poor taste in time. After brewing, you must stand and wait for the last drop to fall since when you withdraw the open carafe, there is no shut off valve under the filter cone to stop liquid flow. Must manually turn off machine at completion. Yes, it has an excellent boiler and makes a great cup of java. But how this machine has received such high ratings is a mystery. It has major design and build quality issues that ruin a potentially great design. There is a replacement available now called the CDT model that is 1/2" taller and will accept the carage with the cap screwed on.

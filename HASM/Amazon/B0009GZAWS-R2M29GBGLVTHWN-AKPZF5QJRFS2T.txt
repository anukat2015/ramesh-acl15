Title: This camera gets the job done and more!
Content:
I've been using this camera for a year now and for the price that I purchased it for, it's more than ample for all of my photography needs.  I have many photographer friends who use the more expensive canon 20d and they have all been impressed by this camera's point and shoot auto program capabilities.  It's great if you want some professional shots and are new to SLR's.  If you want to see some of my work, go to flickr.com and look up spunkymort.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CAMERA!

Title: Good features, quiet, but tippy
Content:
I like the three heat settings, plus fan only.  Thermostat works really well in holding the temperature in a tight range.  (Not something my other heaters do well.)  However, because its thin in depth, it tips over easily, especially on carpeted floors.  Quality seems good or better than average for an inexpensive, plastic housing heater.

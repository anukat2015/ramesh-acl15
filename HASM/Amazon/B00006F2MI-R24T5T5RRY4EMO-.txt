Title: leaks all over when pouring...be careful!
Content:
I bought this coffee maker for my husband for Christmas. It makes great coffee but the carafe leaks when pouring. I badly scalded my hand and will not let guest pour their own coffee in fear that they will also get hurt. They need to come up with a fix for this problem as I see alot of complaints from other consumers regarding the leaking. It does make excellent coffee.

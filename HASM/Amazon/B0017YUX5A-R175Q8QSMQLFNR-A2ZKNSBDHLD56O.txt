Title: powerful and no-nonsense
Content:
This Hoover is a very good appliance. I will never again use a bagless vacuum cleaner! Very clean, very solid HEPA filtration. The only problem would be in that we need an attachment that can clean under tight places (under beds, under sofas). Although this unit comes with two attachments (onboard) and two attachments separate, none are really useful for carpeting under this type of furniture. Still, I would highly recommend this vacuum over almost every other we have tried over the years. Sleek, modern design; easy to maneuver; great features (auto cord rewind, two power settings). The components appear well-made and durable (no cheap plastics). Also, the service was excellent! Delivery within a couple of days standard cost (via UPS). I especially appreciate having easy access to Hoover's customer service if we need it. Highly recommend the Hoover Platinum series overall.

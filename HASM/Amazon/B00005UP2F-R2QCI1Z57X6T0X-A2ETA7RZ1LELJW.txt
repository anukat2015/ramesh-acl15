Title: It's the best!!!!
Content:
After reading other reviews, I purchased this vacuum.  Oh, my gosh!!! It's the best.  Everything about it is simple and efficient.  It zaps up cat hair from corners, it empties easily, it's quieter than my last vacuum.  And the best part is that it sits on the stairs while you vacuum and doesn't fall down.  Could you ask for anything more?

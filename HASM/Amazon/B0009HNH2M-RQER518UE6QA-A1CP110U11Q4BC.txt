Title: Powerful with a bag for the dust and dirt
Content:
I was looking for a powerful canister vac with a powered floor brush so I could clean under the bed and the sofa. It had to have a disposable bag, because I was tired of the mess made when I emptied the bagless upright I bought last year. Hoover is now part of Maytag, and both makers have excellent reputations. This Hoover S3590 is just what I wanted, and it is very satisfactory. It also has an automatic cord rewinder, and the cord is long enough. It would be hard to find anything to complain about with this vacuum.

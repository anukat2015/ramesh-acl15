Title: Excellent
Content:
This vaccum is great. I have a cleaning business and I take it every where I go. Also, my husband sells used cars and uses it to detail the cars, they look professionally done. The suction and power is great.Though it is not great on carpets, it is excellent on carpeted stairs, wood floors, kitchen and bathroom floors, basement floors, you name it. My best purchase for my business, I will be buying a second one to rotate the two since I use it so often.

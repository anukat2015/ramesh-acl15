Title: Very satisfied for a first-time DSLR owner
Content:
I was deciding between a Canon 40D and this camera.  For me, the form factor is a big plus, because I plan on lugging this onto an airplane along with my laptop in my carryon.  I tend not to abuse my electronics too much, so the whole question of plastic body on the XSi vs. a metal body for the 40D wasn't an issue for me.  Two points that favored the 40D: the continuous RAW mode is better (for baby's first steps, or sports) and the kit lens for the 40D is more versatile (a little wider than 35mm and out to 5X zoom, vs 3X zoom on the XSi kit lens).  For me, it wasn't worth the extra cost (*edit*: with the instant rebate on the 40D right now from Canon, about $300 difference).
I decided to splurge on a DSLR over an point-and-shoot because I always got frustrated with sunset and lowlight shots with my point-and-shoot (I have an Olympus Stylus 400).  Either the picture would be blown out or too dark.  Also, indoor shots without flash would often be too grainy because of the inferior image processing in my pocket camera.  Much less of a problem with a DSLR, where I've been able to twiddle with the ISO and the aperture to get decent shots in all the above-mentioned situations.
Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product.  4 stars because Canon doesn't include a SD card  in the kit (c'mon, even my point-and-shoot came with a weenie card).

Title: On/Off switch dies too soon
Content:
Bought a VH2 Vornado heater less than 5 years ago.  I live in Southern Cal so this heater is used on occasion in a covered patio during late Fall and winter months.  The other day the on/off switch went limp and died, the heater won't turn on.  This heater has probably been used less than 300 times in the few years we've had it.  It was sufficient when it worked but on/off switches should be the last thing to die.  Do I cough up more than half the original price to have it fixed?  Probably not.  Anyone got a suggestion on another more reliable brand?

Title: Horrible
Content:
Within 2 months of using this laptop the wireless internet does not work properly and the E drive only accepts DVDs/CD's when it wants to. Now the USB connections are loose and does not connect. Toshiba tech support is not much help and the only way I can get repairs done is by shipping it to the South (live in CA). Think twice before ordering a Toshiba.

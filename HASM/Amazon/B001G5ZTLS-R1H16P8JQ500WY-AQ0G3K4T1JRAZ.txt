Title: I'm blown away!!!
Content:
What can I say, the is one amazing camera. I bought this to replace my old body (20D). Full frame is the way to go, I can't say enough about this camera. The image quality is amazing, low light photography is better then expected. The added video is nice, while the live view is a welcomed change. I also purchased the battery grip with this unit plus a large (16gb) high speed card, you definitely need the larger memory card if you will be shooting in raw+jpg, like i do. Now I can take advantage of my "L" glass with this camera. Well worth the price! My clients will appreciate the end result. One last thing, if you are a extreme macro photographer, you will take advantage of the live view function, it helps when you reach for a shot especially with the Canon MP-E 65mm Lens, Canon MT-24EX Flash. Happy Shooting!

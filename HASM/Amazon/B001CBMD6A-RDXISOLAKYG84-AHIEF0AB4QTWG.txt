Title: Lots of bells and whistles.
Content:
The Canon XS is the best camera I have owned so far.  It has a lot of options, many of which I have not used to date, but I will be taking a class at the local community college that will show me what it can do that I have not yet done.  I just find it hard to sit down and read a manual that is close to 150 pages long.  I'd just as soon read the tax codes.

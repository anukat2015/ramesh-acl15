Title: Saved the day!
Content:
I bought this after my landlady who I'm renting a room from couldn't get her act together to get our heating fixed after a week and it's been below freezing every night. I've been getting sick and have finals coming up in school. So, my husband in Canada sent me off to Target to get myself this heater and within an hour my room was 72 degrees!!! The digital face is very nice, especially when you have those restless nights with a cold. Every time you wake up you can easily read the temperature to set your mind at ease that you're warm enough. It's been a relief!

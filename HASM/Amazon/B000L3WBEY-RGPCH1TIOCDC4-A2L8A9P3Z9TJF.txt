Title: Noisy 'lil thang - gotta go back.
Content:
Way too much high-pitched fan noise that runs at the same speed all the time when on. Gotta return it. But how? Seller very uncooperative.
In sum: I regret the purchase.
Much better is the type of ceramic heater with an infinitely variable heat setting such that as the room warms up, the fan slows and the wattage drops (hence heat output drops) proportionately and automatically. I used to have one in the office. Looked kinda like the Pelonis units (yes, 2) I regrettable did by. My mistake...
Anyone know who makes an automatically adjusted thermostat controlled heater?

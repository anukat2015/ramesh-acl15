Title: Very happy to have this camera
Content:
I researched for a couple of months about this type of camera. There are tonns of information on this type of camera and it is hard to sort out the BS.  Finally bit the bullet and have no regrets other than how to pack it.  The extra lens is great, a 70-300mm that gets me there without having to danger myself climbing close enough to my target.  I really like the photos this camera produces  and I am sure that the camera is built to last.  I only dislike the size and I must figure out how to pack it in with laptop "sony aw series 18.4"" and my other gear into a carry on bag. It will be interesting.

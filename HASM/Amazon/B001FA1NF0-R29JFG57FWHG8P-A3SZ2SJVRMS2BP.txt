Title: 4th gen nano review
Content:
Purchased as a gift for my best friend.  The look on their face made it very worthwhile.  Now, the thing is...I'm a little jealous of them having the nicer, newer model!  Aesthetically, and memory-wise, it out-shines my ipod (a 3rd gen nano).  I also purchased this gift for less than I paid for my own...a year ago!  If you want an MP3 player, look nowhere else than apple ipods, whatever the generation!  I still won't be trading mine in anytime soon.

Title: Almost perfect single serve coffee maker!!!!
Content:
After reading a LOT of reviews on this coffee maker I decided it was worth a try especially because of the low price!  I love it!!!!  I've had it for a few weeks now and I make about 2-3 cups per day.  It's perfect for me because I am the only coffee drinker in the house.
Several reviewers noted that they got coffee grounds in their coffee.....solution from another reviewer is to use size 1 coffee filters (which I have used every time) which fit nicely and cleanup is a breeze!!!  I bought them at the grocery store for $1.99 for 40 filters.
Also, I don't fill the water to the fill line.  I usually just use 1 cup of water.  I haven't had a problem with overflow as some people have.
I put 1 C. of water in the reservoir,  1 1/2 Tablespoons of ground coffee in the filtered cup then put my creamer and sweetener in the mug and turn it on.
The brew time is about 2 minutes.  I turn it on and I can always find something to do in the kitchen or other room to do until my coffee is ready!
I only have 2 complaints which are minimal:
1.  after taking your mug o coffee out of the coffee maker, it drips.....solution = Before removing the mug, move the coffee maker back and forth to get the rest of the coffee into the cup and then replace the mug with a piece of paper towel.
2.  DO NOT immerse your coffee mug in water!  I did this to wash my mug before my first use and water gets trapped in the mug.  I had a b**ch of a time shaking the water out!
For under $20 this coffee maker is a steal!!!!

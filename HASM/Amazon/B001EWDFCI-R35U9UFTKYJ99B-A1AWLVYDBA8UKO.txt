Title: Great player
Content:
I have this one and have used it on multiple windows vista computers. No problems and love the marketplace to download mutliple songs for just a flat monthly rate. Only thing I don't really like is no equalizer and not enough accessories at the stores. Even though there are plenty online. Still sounds great and has better operating system than Itunes.

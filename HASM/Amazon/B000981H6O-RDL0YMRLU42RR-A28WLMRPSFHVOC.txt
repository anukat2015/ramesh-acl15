Title: Still the best hand held vac I've owned
Content:
I won the Hoover S1120 Wet/Dry Hand Vac at my company picnic a few years ago.  I used it regularly and at some point dropped it on a cement floor at my home and broke it.  As I can't get along without a hand held vac for quick pick ups, I was delighted to find this model is still available.  It does an extremely great job on all types of small spills and messes on both hard floors and carpeting.

Title: IE 8 Issues and Initial Back Up crashed DVD drivers
Content:
Purchased this Sony VGN-NW240F and have some issues with it.
IE 8 came installed with windows 7 and it still sometimes
disables the back button AND internet options under Tools still fails.
I have to close ALL IE8 windows and clear temp. int. files
and then both back button and internet options under tools
gets RE-Enabled (Greyed Out) when it fails.
Also the first time I did a back up to Media CD (using DVD Drive)
the Sony crashed and killed my DVD drivers and I had to uninstall
all dvd drivers and reinstall them.
I have contacted Sony Chat support 4x now with no luck
and issues still persist.
I also dont like that in idle mode using IE8 and Windows 7
sometimes the webpage contents disappear leaving only
Sony or VAIO in the background, until you clik in the
same window then the contents do come back, very annoying
when your working with two windows at once.
The features are nice and LCD screen very nice.
No problems with wireless features to routers or printers either.

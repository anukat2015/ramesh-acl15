Title: Buy this at your own RISK!!! Weak battery and bad design
Content:
I had a Sansa but that broke down after a few years and decided to upgrade and get an Ipod.  After using it for a week the battery would not last past 2 hours, and I was only using it for music NOT video.  Now I understand why they sell those ipod docks to recharge, but it got ridiculous recharging it after every workout.  
The design is annoying to deal with as well.  If you want to increase the volume you have to have a soft touch or you're in for a headache!!!  It's so sensitive that you're likely to blast your ears with sound.  This is the opposite of the Sansa products which weren't as sensitive.  It's so sensitive that if you put it in your pocket while working out the volume will often change on you unexpectedly high or low.    
I wouldn't get this if you plan to workout with it.  Its like buying a luxury car for a race.  It just doesn't work in those circumstances.  I'm not happy with this product.  The nano was not worth the money and I doubt I'll ever buy another one ever again.

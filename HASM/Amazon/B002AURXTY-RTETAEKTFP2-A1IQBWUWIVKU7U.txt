Title: I Love It !!!
Content:
This is my first laptop and I love it. The screen is beautiful, the battery life is great and it has been easy to customize setting. amazons price would be hard to beat; I looked a lot and this is a great price! The only downside I have found is when I bought it there was a offer for a free upgrade to windows 7 and after it arrived I'm having problems finding info on it. Overall still a great buy!

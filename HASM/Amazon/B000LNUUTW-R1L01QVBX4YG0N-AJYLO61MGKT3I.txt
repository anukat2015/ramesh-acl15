Title: Good burn time
Content:
I purchased the Heat Mate for my home office. I'm getting over 14 hours per gallon and I only need about 90 minutes in the morning to get the room toasty.  I can then then turn it off and not use it again until the evening.  Fuel here is $4.27 a gallon so figure about 92 cents a day. Yes, it is a little smelly but I expected that. I crack a window for sure:) It does what I wanted and is a quality product at a reasonable price. I expect to get many years of usage.

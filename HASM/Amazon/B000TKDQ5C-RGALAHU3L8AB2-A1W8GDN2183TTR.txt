Title: Great price, great item!
Content:
This heater is just what I needed! It is very compact, sharp looking, pretty quiet, and heats amazingly. I use it for the bathroom to heat the room while bathing my little one. For the application, it is very quiet. However, if you want to use it in a bedroom it may be a little too loud. 
I am very happy with the purchase!

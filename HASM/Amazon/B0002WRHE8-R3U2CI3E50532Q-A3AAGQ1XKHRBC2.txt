Title: Very Warm heater
Content:
We went To GA and went camping the weekend before Thanksgiving and it was COLD.  We slept well in our tent using this heater, only thing I would recommend is to get the attachment to use a 5 gal propane bottle instead of the 1 gal ones, as we had to get up in the middle of the night to change the tanks.

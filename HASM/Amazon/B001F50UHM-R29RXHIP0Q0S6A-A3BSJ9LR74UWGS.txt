Title: Battery Life Less than Claimed
Content:
First the good news.  This product has excellent sound quality when playing songs or when using the FM radio.  In fact, on the FM, it has much better quality than the Sony radio I was previously using.
The bad news is that the 30+ hour rated battery falls woefully short.  I get from 15 to 20 hours and that's using the FM radio (which should require less juice than playing songs from the hard drive).  Very disappointing.
Also bad news is the female contact on the unit.  It is unique to Sony. And to add insult to injury, it will only charge up using my computer and the USB cord that was provided.  It will not charge on the AC or DC chargers that I purchased separately.

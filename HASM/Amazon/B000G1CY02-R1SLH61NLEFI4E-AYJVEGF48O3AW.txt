Title: Disappointed
Content:
After reading the high ratings of this product here on Amazon and in Consumer Reports, I finally thought I had solved my 9' x 25' sunroom heating problem, not so. On Thanksgiving day the temp outside was 44 and the sunroom temp was 57. The heater was turned on high and after 6 hours the room temp had raised 3 degrees to 60. I guess I will continue to use my small natural gas heater that my wife wants me to replace because of the smell (although it can raise the room temperature 10 degrees in 1 hour or less). Does anyone make an electric heater that will actually warm more than your feet?

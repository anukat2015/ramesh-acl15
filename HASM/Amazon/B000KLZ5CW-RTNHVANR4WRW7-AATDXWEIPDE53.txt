Title: not what I thought it would be
Content:
recieved the Whynter Sno and read the info which had both heat and cool operation. When I recieved an only cool version and contacted the company they said they were out of stock of the unit I was expecting and sent a cool only version. Shipment cost were too great to send back and forth so I kept the cool version and bought a separate heater. Poor customer service to send the cool version when out of stock rather than notifying me of the issue and ask what my preference was.

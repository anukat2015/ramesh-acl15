Title: Piece of junk!
Content:
you get what you pay for. Almost every part of this poorly designed vac cleaner has a fault. so let's start:
1) carpet/ floor nozzle doesn't stay in "brush setting" for hardwood floor 
2) nozzle falls off
3) Connecting hose falls off the metal wand all the time and hits your toes/foot - ouch!!
4) cheap plastic hose twists and kinks off, resulting in loss of suction
5) the plastic body housing the vac mechanism constantly goes belly up everytime you manouvre it
6) cord got tangled inside housing after 8 months, I had to take the orange cover apart to fix it (harder than it sounds)
7) useless accessory brush - too small a footprint to do anything useful with it
8) poor suction even when it's turned up to MAX
9) holder for the wand broke off after 3 months, cheap plastic thing that's obviously not strong enough to withstand the torque of a long wand resting on it
10) So loud when it's going you better wear an earmuff if you don't want to go deaf prematurely
DO NOT waste your hard earned 60 bucks on this piece of crap!

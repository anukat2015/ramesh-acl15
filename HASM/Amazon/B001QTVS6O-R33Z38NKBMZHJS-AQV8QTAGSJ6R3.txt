Title: Watered down coffee
Content:
We had to replace our old Senseo because of the recall.  It was a great coffee maker, but after two years it wouldn't work all the time. 
We purchased the new and "improved" Senseo and our coffee is very watered down...no matter how we set the machine, it comes out watery.
Very dissappointed!!

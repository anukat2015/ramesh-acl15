Title: Sounds sick, but I actually enjoyed vacuuming today
Content:
I have to agree with whoever called the Dyson 21's power like a black hole.  I, too, vacuumed my recently cleaned home, and collected 4 times as much dust and fur than I ever got with the previous vacuum.  I'm in a small RV, which has cloth walls and ceiling as well, and the accessories with this vacuum will help keep the Himalayan cat fur off of everything.  
I was surprised at how quietly it runs.  
My RV is quite small, so storing this unit is a challenge.  I didn't wrap the hose around and hang the carpet tool.  Things are tucked away here and there.  Since the parts are easy to reattach, this isn't a problem.
I was pleased to see that the wand doesn't have to be extended to use the accessories.  
The dirt container was very easy and clean to empty.  
I've used this vacuum only once, since it arrived just today.  Hope it continues to do such a good job for years.  I'm looking forward to doing a little more cleaning tomorrow.  (I know - get a life.)

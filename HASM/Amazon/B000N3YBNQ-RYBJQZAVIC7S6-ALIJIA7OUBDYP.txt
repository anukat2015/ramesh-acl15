Title: Better than a big cleaner
Content:
I read all the reviews before I bought it. I found that the suction was way more than I expected. To the point I may not even bother to get my expensive vacuum cleaner repaired now. I had bought this model as a temporary replacement, but if it continues to perform as good as it has the last 3 days, it will be my regular vacuum. Yes, the bag is small, but my rooms are no bigger than 12 x 14 anyway, and all my outlets are centered, so moving the cord isn't the chore others have commented on. The big wheels do take some getting used to, but it rolls easily for me. I love the adjustable handle as well as the carpet/floor option. It picks up everything including cat litter. The edge suction is better than my other vacuum too. It picks up pet hair with ease. My old vacuum just moved it around, this actually picks it up. I am thinking of getting a second one, just in case this one ever dies on me. Hopefully of old age.

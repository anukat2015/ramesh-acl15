Title: Terrific for amateurs transitioning from point-and-shoot
Content:
This is the first dSLR I own, but not the first advanced-amateur digital. I always thought that even the worst film camera had better quality than a digital --- unless you were willing to pay a fortune. I'm glad this camera proved me wrong. For less than 500 you get terrific quality, a relatively light and simple to use camera that would give you much more satisfaction than other cameras. 
Among the many virtues of this camera I'd point out:
- Excellent image quality: sharpness, depth of field, colors, etc. 
- Meaningful quality: The 6MP sensor produces just the right amount of detail without overburdenning the user with heavy image files, slow transfers, etc. Keeping the MP count low was a priority when I bought this camera and I'm happy to see that I was right.
- Good controls. I'm certain that more advanced users would like more knobs and button customization, but for users who want to take pictures without much tweaking, the scene knob and the dial provide a great means of control for regular situations. More advanced tweaking requires the menu, but I find that a reasonable compromise to keep the camera simple. Compared to the other (non SLR) cameras I used (Canon, Olympus, Sony) this interface is the best.
- It's light and compact
What I would have preferred:
- VR lens offered by default
- ISO 100 (yet the minimum ISO=200 setting is way better than the ISO 64 setting in a prosumer canon!)
- More battery life (but I'm using it with eye-fi, which likely drains power faster)
Overall, the quality of this camera is great; it's fairly intuitive and easy to use, very responsive. You immediately are taking pictures with simple settings. At the same time it allows the user a lot of customization. It reminds me a lot the spurt of creative photography I experienced with the coolpix 950, but certainly with a much better quality.

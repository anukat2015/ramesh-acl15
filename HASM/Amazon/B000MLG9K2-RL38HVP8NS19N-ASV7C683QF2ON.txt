Title: SLR to DSLR-Made the Switch
Content:
While it took many months of research and comparison, I finally narrowed the decision down to the Nikon D80.  I have to say that I was slightly influenced by the slight lead that Nikon continues to hold in their high quality lenses.  My main choice was between the Nikon D80 and the Canon EOS.  My hands are smaller, and the Nikon just seemed to fit better.
The capabilities of both systems are amazing, and it boils down to which you like better.  The in camera editing feature of the D80 is a nice touch and has been useful occasionally. 
I am by no means anything more than an amateur shooter, but this camera has been easy to use, and to figure out more as I progress in my capabilitys.  For a hobbyist, this is a great appetizer before you jump to the pro level cameras, and teaches you many things.

Title: Exactly what we were looking for...
Content:
The price was just right and everything has worked perfectly.  It was easy to install and program.  Recently we went on vacation and set it for 80 degrees while we were gone.  We set it to reprogram to 72 degrees two hours before we were to get home.  The house was nice and cool when we got back.  We highly recommend this for everyone.

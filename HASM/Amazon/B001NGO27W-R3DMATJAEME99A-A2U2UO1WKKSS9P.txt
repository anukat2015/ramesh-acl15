Title: OUTSTANDING UPGRADE!
Content:
This is my third Cuisinart coffee machine ... other two were the 12 cup model -- kissing cousin to this upgrade.
They greatly improved the features on this machine -- water level is now visible from the OUTSIDE and it has an added feature of selecting the flavor for "regular" or "bold".  Of course the charcoal filter continues to be a plus feature.
As mentioned above, this is my third Cuisinart coffee maker.  My first was a result of Consumer Reports' high rating ... purchased it around 2001 or 2002 -- I forget.  Anyway, it worked well until it was almost 3 years old (warranty period is 3 years) ... it started making a snapping & popping noise while brewing.  As it was still under warranty, I shipped it back (at my expense) and they replaced it with a refurbished model.  
All in all, if you really enjoy your morning cup of coffee (and having it ready as soon as you step into the kitchen) ... I highly recommend this upgraded model.  You won't be disappointed!

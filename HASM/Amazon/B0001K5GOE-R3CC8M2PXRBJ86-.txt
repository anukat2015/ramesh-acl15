Title: Awesome Full-Size/Full-Power vacuum cleaner smallest package
Content:
This awesome canister vacuum cleaner replaces my bagless upright by other leading brand H. I'm amazed at all the innovations that this vacuum cleaner has. Such as: Telescoping hose that's very well built, compact size when callapse telescope hose, winding power cord, Turbine head that works on all floors with a revolutionary head with rollers that could stop with one touch of a button for hard floors, easy to empty and hygienically no touching of dirt, has lifetime filters &quot;HEPA&quot;, hand tools, 2yr warranty, and much much more. I sound as if I work for Dyson, &quot;I DON'T&quot;, but I'm totally impress with this machine. Now for my house with mostly carpet and very little hardfloor in baths and kitchen only I could say that this vacuum cleaner is the best I've ever used. I've tried bag types, bagless types etc, mostly from H brand. Performance and easy to use canister style makes this vacuum the ultimate vacuum cleaner. Very happy customer and recommend this vacuum over all current brands out there.

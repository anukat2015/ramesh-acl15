Title: good coffee, lousy carafe
Content:
I bought this model of coffee maker for my husband for Christmas. We have now used it about 10 times at most. The coffee maker itself is fine, and he loves the coffee, but the carafe just cracked! We called Cuisinart, and oh, guess what? The carafe isn't covered under their warranty. Gee thanks...now we have to spend either $25 for the glass carafe or $48 for the stainless carafe. Word to the wise...buy the stainless since it can't crack.

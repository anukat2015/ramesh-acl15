Title: Nice laptop, Terrible screen
Content:
While having lots of RAM, a big hard drive, a really fast processor, and Blu-ray, the screen on this laptop ruins it. They seem to have decided to arrange it so that the screen can be watched by two people sitting side-by-side, from a distance. And it's okay. 
But, up-close--say, on your LAP--the screen has different colors between the top and bottom of the screen, at any viewing angle. And the backlight is clearly brighter at the bottom. Also, color reproduction at any angle is simply atrocious. The "Vivid" colors you see in the store are the ONLY colors you'll ever see. Even if you're looking at something non-vivid. The screen is like computing on a Lite-Brite. It's atrocious. 
If you want a laptop to watch Blu-ray discs, then, sure, this is a good laptop. If you want it for hobby photography or anything in which color accuracy is needed, run away

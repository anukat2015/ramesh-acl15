Title: The best coffee maker I have ever owned!
Content:
This Cuisinart DGB-600BC is the best machine and the best deal.
I bought the reconditioned one from Amazon last month. I could not believe the good price. I told my neighbor, co-workers and relatives about it. I was surprised to find out two things: How many of these machines are out there and how many of these owners had a bad experience with leaking on the carafe. Cuisinart has certainly gotten these fixed and my own machine works great. I am even going to buy an second machine to use as a gift.

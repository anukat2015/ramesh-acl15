Title: Nearly 3 yrs old and going strong
Content:
I bought Hoover Windtunnel from Amazon in January of 2006.  I thought my previous vac was doing a good job, but I was disappointed that the carpeting that I had bought less than two years before wasn't holding up very well.  It was beginning to mat down.  After I used the Hoover on it, the nap stood straight up and it looked new.
The Hoover is still doing a great job and I haven't had to replace anything except the filter in the dirt receptacle.  I probably wouldn't have had to replace that except that I followed instructions and rinsed it with water.  If you live in an area with heavy clay soil, just tap it out on the porch railing.  I had to replace the original filter within a few months.  I have had the second one for two years now.
I don't have a huge house and I am not a vacuum freak, but it does get used on 4 rooms at least once a week and on the two rooms with bare floors occasionally.

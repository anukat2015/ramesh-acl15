Title: No more pot to break - Not great for wood tables
Content:
I love this coffee maker.  I was tired of breaking coffee pots and this has been a great solution.  The only warning I have is place it on a surface that can take some condensation.  For some reason the steam gets trapped and then condenses on the counter (below the maker).  We have ours on a tiled countertop, so its no big deal.  But if your coffee maker is placed somewhere that water might ruin the surface, this might not be the one for you.

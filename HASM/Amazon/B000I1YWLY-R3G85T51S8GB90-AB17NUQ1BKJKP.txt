Title: a quiet, very effective vacuum, but heavy
Content:
This vacuum was delivered promptly, in" brand new" condition.  The collection container is very easy to remove and empty!  You press a release and it lifts out of the vacuum and there is a door that opens on one end with thumb pressure on a lever.  I find it dust free to empt.  The vacuum is very good at picking up pet hair and doing both rugs and hard floors.  The hard floor attachment is very wide and I do the floor in half the time as with my old machine just due to this. It is much quieter than my old wind tunnel ever was.  The furniture attachment is not very effective so I use the brush attachment and it is ok.  I run the powerhead over my couch, yes the powerhead, not easy but soooo effective.  Remember I have cats and dogs.  The wand easily detaches and reattaches by just pressing simple releases.  I found my old hoover very difficult as the parts literally stuck together and the electric connection was a very difficult plug under the wand! This is an excellent machine for most people.   It is for me, an arthritic, really too heavy.  I would not recommend it for arthritics, but there are few machines out there at this price that fill their needs.  I cannot say anything about durability as I have not had it long enough.  I purchased through Amazon and was very pleased with the service.

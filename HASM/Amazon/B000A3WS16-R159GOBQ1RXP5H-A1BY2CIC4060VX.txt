Title: so far, so good
Content:
i've only had this product for...maybe a month, and so far it has worked fine. I do think i have to reset it more than usual when i'm trying to turn it on, which i find weird. Basically, sometimes it won't turn on when i press the play button. i usually listen to it at night, and fall asleep before the playlist ends, and when i try to turn it on the next day, i have to do the 'reset' procedure. maybe i'm just not used to the little quirks of an ipod? battery life has been decent, since i use my ipod practically everyday, i do have to charge it every night or so, but i knew about battery life expectations when i was looking for an ipod. i bought a case for it, because i wanted to protect the ipod (since i use it on a regular basis). Other than these 2 things (battery and reset), the ipod has worked software-wise when i have to plug it into my computer. it has lived up to my expectations for an ipod.

Title: Love it!  and Amazon was great about a replacement
Content:
I love this little I Pod. I used it with my new surround sound system and it went dead when I removed it. In a panic I contacted Amazon and they had a new one sent overnight.Meanwhile with some internet search ,I found a fix (re boot).So did not send the problem unit back to Amazon.I decided to allow them to charge me for the new one and I gave that away as a gift to an unfortunate PODLESS person. I was impressed with the professional and responsible service from Amazon!

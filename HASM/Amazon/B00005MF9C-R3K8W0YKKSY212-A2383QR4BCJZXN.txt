Title: Had mine for 5 years and always works great
Content:
I have had this machine for five years now so I thought someone might like to here a long term review.  Mine does not have a stainless cup, but my cup is tapered like this one.
Pros:
1) Brews 1 cup (I'm the only one who drinks it).
2) Quick, about 2 minutes to brew and 5 to finish dripping.
3) Easy to clean.  I have rinsed the entire unit several times.
4) No trash.  Comes with a permanent filter.
5) Filter cleans easily.  Just tap out the coffee in the trash and rinse.
5) Can be used with a timer.  See below for explanation.
6) Takes up very little space.
7) Can be used with other cups.  As long as you don't overflow the reservoir and your cup will fit under it, the cup will work.
Cons:
1) It is gravity fed through the filter so 5 minutes may be too long for some.
2) Be sure to line up the exit spout with hole.  Once you get it you will see, but if you don't you will have coffee all over your counter.
3) If you grind you coffee to fine, you will get coffee grinds on the inside of the machine.  No big deal as you can rinse the unit off easily.
Timer:
Once you activate the unit it will run until the reservoir is empty.  The only way to stop it is to unplug it.  However, if you plug it back in it will pick up where it left of.  If you activate it with it unplugged, it will start as soon as it is plugged in.  Therefore, if you want coffee when you wake up, all you need is a wall timer (about $5 from many sources).  Set the timer to activate in the morning when you want your coffee.  Prepare the machine like normal, depressing the activation button.  When the timer turns on in the morning the machine will begin brewing your coffee.

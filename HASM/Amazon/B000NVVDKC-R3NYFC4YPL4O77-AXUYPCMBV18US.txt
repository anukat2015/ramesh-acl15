Title: One Sweet Camera
Content:
After being a very happy owner of an e500 for about a year, I decided to step up to the e510 for the 10 megapixels, and the Image Stabilization - and I was a little curious about the Live-View feature.  Wow, it was a good move.  It's been 4 weeks and about 1000 pictures - and I am very happy.
Olympus makes a very high quality camera with features that REALLY work.  The Image Stabilization will truly save that low light, or long telephoto, shot when you don't have a tripod.  Honestly, I've taken some very crisp pics where I thought they wouldn't turn out.
The Live-View is pretty cool, even though it takes a bit of getting used to.  It's not like your typical "point & shoot" LCD, but it HAS given me GREAT results the few times I have used it.
It has outstanding battery life, and a great feel in your hand.  I suppose some will say the e510 is not perfect, but photographically speaking, it is MUCH more perfect than I am - and it makes me a much better photographer!  After a month of use, I haven't found anything to complain about.

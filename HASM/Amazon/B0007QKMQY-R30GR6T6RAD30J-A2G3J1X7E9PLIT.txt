Title: awesome...no need to spend more
Content:
I'm a professional photographer who not only started out with this camera but still use it exclusively. Now with that said, I did invest in some high quality but affordable glass and some off camera flashes with triggers. The next step up from this camera would probably be a full frame camera that would cost thousands of dollars. This little affordable camera will take you VERY far. It has plenty of megapixels even for enlargements up to 11X14 without losing quality. I shoot models, family portraits and weddings and have never wished for a better camera. I think my only complaint and it's minor, is that the LCD screen is rather small. If you want to see the quality this is capable of check out my flickr site [...]
Buy this camera with the 50mm F/1.8 lens, the 18-55mm IS lens and a cheap Sunpak 383 flash and you'll be happy with your pictures -providing you read up on how to use it to maximize the quality of this camera. Good place to start is blogs and especially the forums on flickr....everything you ever wanted to know or ask has already been addressed there...just search

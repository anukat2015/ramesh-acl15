Title: Fast and tasteful
Content:
My last Gevalia Coffee and Tea Pod maker I had worn it out. This one is a little different than my last one. I do have to say though, that it is easier to clean the head, but, I use 2 pods and it is hard to get the pods to stay in the cups. so I put them both in the top cup and insert it into the main holder. My last one the cups were a lot easier to use and were "deeper" where you could put 2 pods. Everything else about it I do like better than my last one.

Title: Spectacular Beast!!!! LOVE IT!!
Content:
I am beyond pleased even after paying the rather large amount for the top of the line of this AW series - AW-170YQ.
And it is definitely a beast in weight... I had mistakenly always bought the very light laptops and since I work as a Web developer and photographer I was always trying to make things work without enough disk space or horse power and then there is the lack of screen real estate. This just satisfies it all... I was always worried I wanted something light to carry but in the end I don't carry it around all that much - travel with it and take it to clients at times.
The greatest beauty I find is that I now use this as my desktop computer and while I still keep my desktop CPU for back up space and a secondary computer in case this should fail, etc. It is a joy to ALWAYS have all my files all the time. In the past I had always hustle to transfer over to my laptop all the files I might need... now that is never a concern -- saving a lot of time and possible disasters if forgetting a file.
The screen is amazing, keyboard is excellent as well as the mousepad although I love the Sony bluetooth mouse - works perfectly.
I have now had it for about 3 months and I love it everyday.
Only problem I have had is when I put it to sleep and close the lid it seems to wake up again with the lid closed - but I am sure there is a simple reason why this is occurring and can be fixed.

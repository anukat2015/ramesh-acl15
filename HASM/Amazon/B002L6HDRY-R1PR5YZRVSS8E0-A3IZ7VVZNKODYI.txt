Title: Oops
Content:
Labeled this particular iPod an "Oops" because Amazon (not some other vendor, but Amazon) sent me a used iPod when I purchased a new one.  How did I know it was used?  First, no cover on the plastic box. Second, a big fingerprint on the screen.  Third, about 200 hundred songs were already loaded and were mostly not to my taste.  Possibly fourth, it wouldn't hold a charge (tried charging before I knew it was pre-loaded with songs).
On the flipside, Amazon was very apologetic and has sent a brand new replacement practically overnight (and I have returned the used iPod).  Not sure how the original iPod got sent to me, but clearly it shouldn't have.

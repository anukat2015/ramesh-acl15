Title: We're very pleased w/ this portable swamp cooler
Content:
This thing works great for what it is...a portable swamp cooler. 
I was surprisingly impressed with the quality of the product, the documentation, etc.
The wheels, drain plug, and ice compartment are all huge pluses. The loud beep when you switch functions is my only complaint.

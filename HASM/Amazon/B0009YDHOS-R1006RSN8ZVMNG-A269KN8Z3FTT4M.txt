Title: Good machine for the money
Content:
It seems many of the negative posts are either from ineptitude from operating the machine correctly or were biased to begin with. For $49.00 this machine is definitely worth the money. The machine itself doesn't leak, but if the drip tray isn't closed all the way water will leak onto the counter giving the appearance of leaking. Frothier works good for the price of the machine, and granted it doesn't produce micro-froth, then go buy a top-end machine. 
Try not to use tap water because Chlorine will definitely  effect taste and the ability to produce crema. The machine has been accused of being overly noise, maybe but then again if  noise is an issue again go out and spend $10,000.
Overall this machine is good and dependable for daily use and shot after shot. Bottom line if you have a beer salary don't expect a champagne machine.

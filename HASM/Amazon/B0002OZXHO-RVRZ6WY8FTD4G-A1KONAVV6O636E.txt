Title: One of my best investments
Content:
I didn't really know anything about the ipod until I started college. It seemed like everyone on campus had one, and me (being a person who listens to music almost 24/7) had to have one. At first the price threw me ($300 for a 20gb ipod) but I started playing with ones that friends had and immediately began to see the benefit of owning one. After receiving one as a gift, there hasn't been a day where I haven't used it. So far, I've had it for about two months and haven't had any problems with it. Operating I-Tunes is simple, and accessing your music library on the actual ipod is a breeze. I was able to put my entire music collection (about 1800 songs) onto the ipod quite easily. It automatically recognizes your CD's even if they are burnt. If I-Tunes doesn't automatically recognize the CD, you can easily search for track names or put them on yourself. If you have a lot of music, this process can take awhile, but after you initally put all your existing music on, putting more on is a just matter of minutes. I've heard a lot of complaints about battery life, but mine hasn't been an issue at all. I would recommend that you invest in a good case because the ipod tends to scratch very easily. Other than that, this is a wonderful piece of equipment and I would recommend it to anyone.

Title: Solid Camera - Great Value!
Content:
When going for the NIKON D50 I had the following things in mind:
I wanted a good DSLR camera, magnesium alloy body (no plastic like the Rebel), wide choice of lenses and, of course, good picture quality.
The NIKON D50 gives you all this plus a lot more: It starts up in no time, it is silent, battery autonomy is ok, it is speedy and takes at least 2.5 fps in full res. and it feels very comfortable to use. The internal software (firmware) is excellent.
I had a hard time figuring out the key differences between the Nikon D70 and D50. The way I see it, the extra (aperture) wheel for the right index finger and the DOF preview button on the D70 aren't worth the price difference. One should definitely spend the extra bucks on LENSES!!! The kit lens is good enough for family and vacation snapshots but for the studio or serious photography you shoud consider getting a 30mm f=1.4, a good wide angle (zoom?) lens and some f=2.8 tele.
Always remember those things that yield a good picture:
1. eye of the photographer
2. light, light, light !
3. good photometer (to measure and evaluate light, light, light...)
4. good quality lenses
5. gorgeous nude model
Don't forget to buy the speediest and largest-capacity SD card available.

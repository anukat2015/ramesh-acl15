Title: higher electric bill
Content:
This heater works really well for heating our living room. We found out it is running our electric bill up sky high. It was supposed to be "energy efficient" and lower you heating bills. Well, it has done just the opposite for us. I would not recommend this heater if you are worried about your electric bill.

Title: Nice little fan/cooler
Content:
This lilttle fan/cooler is good. First it kinda takes you back because it resembles and old home furnace but in a modern twist. This cooler works just fine for us in our living room. Which is on the small size. Now this thing isnt gonna make you cold or do the work of a real cooler but its better than a fan and it has many settings to help you adjust it just rite. The ionizer is a great feature. Im not sure how well or how much it ionizes but there are times you can tell its working. Overall I do recommend this product to anyone who needs a little help cooling down and doesnt want to spend Air Conditioner prices. Remember this little guy is great but if youre looking for a major cooling effect this isnt the item for you.

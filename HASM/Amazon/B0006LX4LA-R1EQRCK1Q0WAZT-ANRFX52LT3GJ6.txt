Title: Frustrated with each use, but still good coffee
Content:
The cons far outweigh the pros of this little machine.
Pros:
1. Good cup of coffee
Cons:
1.  Difficult to fill reservoir without spilling
2.  Difficult to fill cup with coffee without spilling (carafe lid leaks)
3.  Difficult to fill cup with coffee without burning hand with escaping steam from carafe.
4.  If you lift the reservoir lid (which also holds the hot water dispenser) at the end of the cycle, water that had formed on the underside of the lid will spill back onto the boiling element and shoot steam and drops of boiling water on you hands and at your face.  One learns the first time not to stand directly in front when attempting to lift lid
5.  Power button cannot be turned-on with one hand
6.  Carafe lid is sometimes difficult to snap into place
I only keep it because it is small and I'm the only coffee drinker at home.  Also, I am too lazy to return it.  Someday, whimsy will present a new machine to me.

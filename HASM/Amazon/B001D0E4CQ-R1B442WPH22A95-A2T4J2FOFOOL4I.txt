Title: Archos 5
Content:
I bought this item for my 2.5yr old on road trips.  Chose this over Apple products because the screen is larger and the storage space is much greater.  So far I think it is a great product.  I also purchased the Archos DVR Station so I could copy shows from cable TV/DVR to the device.  One downside, while watching a video my daughter will touch the screen which brings up the control options.  It would be nice to have a "lock" button to prevent this.  However, I can mount it to the back of the vehicle head rest by using a carrying case or other means (we have a 2005 Honda Pilot which has a hole in the headrest.  I can actually squeeze the Archos 5 into the hole and it stays secure) where she cannot reach it.
It is also nice knowing it is portable and can be used anywhere. I like the web radio functionality.

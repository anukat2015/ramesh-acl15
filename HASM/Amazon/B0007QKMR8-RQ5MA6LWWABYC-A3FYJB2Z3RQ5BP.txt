Title: Great Camera, should have gotten it a long time ago!
Content:
The camera is great! It is exactly like my old film Rebel so the learning curve wasn't that bad. I can still use all my same lenses and other accessories from my film camera. I got the high speed CF and the shooting speed is great. I think the screen could be a little bigger but its not too bad. The price is really good for all that you get. Anyone looking to go digital that is comfortable with their film Canon should buy this because the conversion is so effortless.

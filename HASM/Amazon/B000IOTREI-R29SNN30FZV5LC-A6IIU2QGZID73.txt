Title: Great cost effective heat!
Content:
I bought the Presto heatdish because my house furnace has a issue and one side of the house is not working. I have a few larger portable heaters but they just dont do a good job, even the ones with a fan don't put out the heat you would expect out of a 1,500 watt heater. The Presto is great, heat is instant, covers a large area(approx 8 foot wide by 15 foot). I am sitting currently 15 feet away and can feel the heat, I don't have my house furnace on now and it is 30 degrees outside and I am very comfortable and area I am in is probably 70 degrees or more using just this heater. I have it in a corner of my living room(is 20x20) and works perfect letting you sit far enough away to get the wide area heat and not overheat. I do have to watch my dog, she tries to lay right in front of it and worries me since it does get very intense close to the heater. It is very lightweight and at first I didn't think it was in the box, I'd say it weights under a pound. It had the light which I have no use for, but would make a great thing to use outside if you have a motorhome and want to keep the chill off and have a light at the same time. Overall it is a great product, instant heat and uses slot less power than normal portable heaters.

Title: Love my minolta!
Content:
I have a Dimage G400 that I carry around every day since it is so compact.  It has consistently given me fabulous results and out-performed my canon SD 500 in quality.   Because of this, I gave the Canon away.  
I wanted to upgrade to a digital slr.  I also looked at the canon and nikon.  I decided on the Maxxum 5D for several reasons:  the price, the awesome Minolta quality that has never let me down, the antishake feature, and the fact that I have a Minolta 35mm SLR.  I can use those lenses on the digital SLR.
I've had the maxxum 5D for about 2 months and haven't really had the time to go through all of the instructions and features.  I constantly take pictures but am by no means an expert.  Despite this, my Minoltas deliver such high quality pictures with superb color and clarity.  This is especially obvious when I compare pictures taken by other cameras at the same event - no comparison!  A common drawback of digitals is the need for a bright room for nice pics.  However, the flash is really powerful so I haven't found it to be a problem yet.       So many people give me compliments, even on pictures that were casually shot at the spur of the moment.  The shutter speed is so fast that I can really capture the moments.  
This camera is really impressive.  It attracts a lot of attention even before people see the prints!

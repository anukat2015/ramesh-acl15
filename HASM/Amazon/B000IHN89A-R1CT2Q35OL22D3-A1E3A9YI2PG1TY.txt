Title: Pentax K10.2MP Digital
Content:
So far, so good with this product. I was looking for a good, quality, relatively inexpensive, digital SLR to replace my Nikon F3 film camera for business & personal use. It has been fairly easy to learn to use (for someone not real computer savvy), as well as to operate & process photographs. I have also recently purchased another zoom lens (70-300mm) and a/c adapter to complement the abilities and range of my purchase.

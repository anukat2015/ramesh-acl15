Title: 3rd dead one
Content:
I got a B70 for Xmas and it kept shutting off on its own, so I returned it for another B70.  It had the same problem.  Then I found all the reviews that said the B70 was defective, so I tried the B60.  Same problem again, it won't brew unless I take out the water reservoir and put it back in.  Repeat process for each cup you want to brew.  The auto turn on feature doesn't work because of this, so don't expect a hassle free cup of coffee in the morning.  Definitely not worth it.

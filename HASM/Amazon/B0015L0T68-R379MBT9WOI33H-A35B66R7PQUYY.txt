Title: Poor Man's iPod
Content:
I bought 3 of these as gifts for my kids at Christmas.  I wanted to get them mp3 players, but also wanted to make sure that they wouldn't outgrow the storage capacity.  After some research I found that the Fuze offered the greatest potential to satisfy my needs at a price that couldn't be beat.  These retail for close to $100 at the store but I was able to find them at half that here on Amazon.  These not only match the capabilities of any iPod, but have a few functions that surpass the iPod (radio, voice recorder, expandable memory...) and it costs 3-4 times less!!!  In my opinion this is the highest value multimedia device on the market.

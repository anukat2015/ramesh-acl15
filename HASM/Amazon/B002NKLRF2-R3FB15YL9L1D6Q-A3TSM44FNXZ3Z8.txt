Title: Touch Screen Didn't Work
Content:
I pre-ordered this Zen Xfi2 player after hearing my friend's Zen Xfi which was excellent quality.  I thought it could only be better with the larger touch screen.  The touch screen wouldn't scroll properly.  I finally got it to scroll a couple of times but it gave intermittent performance on the scrolling both directions.
I checked Creative Labs' website and found a firmware update which I installed.  It still wouldn't work.  I have returned it to Amazon.com for a refund.

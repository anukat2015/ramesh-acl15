Title: Great Camera with splendid attributes and picture quality
Content:
After being an olympus SLR user for 3 years (honestly without any complains) I decided to switch to Nikon for various reasons, but particularly for the high ISO capabilities. These camera has met and surpassed all my expectations, and continues to amaze me with every set of pictures I upload. The camera is extremely well built, it is responsive, and the quality of the pictures is great. The video is a great attribute but it needs some tweaking if you want to improve your footage. I would recommend using a tripod and avoid fast moving objects because of the 'rolling shutter' problem that all video SLR cameras still have. Putting this aside, it is obvious that the purpose of this camera is for photography and I have no complains regarding this. I would recommend this camera to any semi-professional or enthusiast photographer that wants an upgrade.

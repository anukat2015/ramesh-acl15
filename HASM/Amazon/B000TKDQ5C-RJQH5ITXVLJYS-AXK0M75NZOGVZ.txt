Title: Love this heater!
Content:
Love this heater so much I bought two.  One for my bedroom and one for my living area.  It is small, light, and doesn't get hot to the touch.  Some say a downside is that it doesn't blow/spread the heat around.  I don't have that issues because I have ceiling fans through out my house.

Title: Good little unit
Content:
This Unit does pretty well for the price. For those of us with windows that do not fit well with regular AC units, this is a good alternative.
There are three adapter plates that fit together to fill the rest of the window opening, it will fill an opening approximately 5 feet high by 8" wide, or an area 5 feet wide by 8" high. 
You attach the hoses to the unit, and then attach the plates to the other end of the hoses.
You open your window, then put the plates into the window, and close the window back onto the plates.
There are TWO hoses (about 6" diameter) and the hoses are only about 4 feet long. This makes it a bit difficult to place the adapter plates in a window, but it can be done. Also, there is no gasket around the plates which leaves a small air gap.
 As I use this with my sliding glass door (which is 7 feet tall), I had to fill the 2 foot gap between the top of the plates and the top of my door. 
This all works, but leaves me thinking that i could have designed a better hose/plate assembly. The AC unit itself is great.
When the temperature was in the 90's it cooled a fairly large room down into the upper 70's, and when the temperature got over 100, this unit cooled the room down enough to be bearable, down to about 86 degrees I think.
All in all I am happy with the AC unit. the hose/plate assembly leaves something to be desired, or I would have rated this a 5 star.

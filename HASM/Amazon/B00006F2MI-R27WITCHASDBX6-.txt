Title: Good Coffee, Poor Carafe
Content:
The Grind and Brew makes great coffee.  I love having the option of fresh ground coffee or preground.  The problem that we have with the product is the Thermal carafe.  I can't poor a cup of coffee without the coffee dripping and leaking all over the counter.  I am VERY disappointed with the product based on that.  I'm not sure if we got a defective one or not....

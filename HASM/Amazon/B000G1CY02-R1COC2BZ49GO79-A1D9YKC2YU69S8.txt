Title: Silent and really warm!
Content:
We live in a studio apartment and the only source of heat we had was a noisy wall unit.  This unit is very thin and we have attached it to the wall.  It is absolutely silent and keeps the studio (approximately 400 square feet) very warm.  It has a temperature control feature that works very well.  I highly recommend this product!

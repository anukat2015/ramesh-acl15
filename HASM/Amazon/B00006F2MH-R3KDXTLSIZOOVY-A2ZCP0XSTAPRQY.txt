Title: great coffee--messy clean-up
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker for the all-inclusive grinder, brewer, timer features. It makes great coffee; however, it is a pain to clean. Steam from the brewing cycle gets into the grinding chamber and creates a coffee sludge in all the nooks and crannies. If you don't clean it immediately the sludge dries into a thick caked-on mess. Also at issue is that the steam condenses on the 2-part removable grinder assembly, so if you want to brew 2 pots of coffee in a row you must remove and dry these parts to avoid making a paste of the freshly-ground beans.

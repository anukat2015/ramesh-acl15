Title: Love it
Content:
We installed one in the nursery.  In the morning there was always a coolness to the room.  Now with the heater, the room is very comfortable all the time.  We went from a conventional wall heater to the eco-heater.  We hard wired it and the thermostat turns it on as needed.  I can't wait for our winter heating bill because it should be way less than what it was with the convention wall heater.  We plan to change our other 3 heaters to the Eco-heater to reduce our amount of electricity that we use. Great product.

Title: Super "Cool"!
Content:
The best addition to my 15' by 20' art studio which I have in the upstairs of my barn. In the summers my studio used to easily get up to 110 degrees and super humid. I wasn't able to use it at all. I turn this conditioner on and 15 minutes later I have to turn it down. I'm sooooo happy. 
Installation took about a day, and you have to have at least two people. It weighs around 250 pounds. You have to make a hole in your wall, add extra support to the opening with some 2by4s, and you have to have 240v electric. So if you're not that handy you may need professional help. 
The only down side that I can think of is that it's pretty expensive. But if you really need air in a difficult space it's well worth it!

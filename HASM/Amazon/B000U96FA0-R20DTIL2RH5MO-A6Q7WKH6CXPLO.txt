Title: Pretty good heater
Content:
I have purchased two Lasko 6350 heaters.
Overall I really like this heater.
The Pros:
- Relatively quiet. Some people mentioned that there is a difference in noise level between the high & low settings. In the model I purchased there was no difference in noise. i.e. the fan level was the same. It is just that in low heat - the amount of heat dispensed is lowed.
- Very nice remote
- Temperature control
- Overall nice performance
The Cons.
- The unit has an option to Oscillate. In one of the units I purchased the Oscillation caused an annoying tapping noise which made me have to replace the heater with another. Since the unit has to be disassembled & reassembled again - that was a little more trouble.

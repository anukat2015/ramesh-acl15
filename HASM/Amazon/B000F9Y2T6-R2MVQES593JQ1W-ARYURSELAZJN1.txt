Title: So easy to use and convenient!
Content:
This machine is so easy to use! I love the option of cleaning my tile floors with heat or no heat, depending on the grime! The mop pad works very well on my sealed hardwood while the brush worked excellent on my grout! I didn't have to go over anything twice and my floors looked great when I was finished! The "flipping" action is also very easy as this machine is lightweight! I love not having to use a mop and bucket and its even better now that this product offers heated cleaning!  Great job!

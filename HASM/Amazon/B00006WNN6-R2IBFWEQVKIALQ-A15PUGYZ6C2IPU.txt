Title: Good Discount Product
Content:
I am satisfied with the purchase of this discount product but I would have paid $5 more for an off switch.
Pros: Cheap, quiet, seems safer that the last cheap heater I had.
Cons: The highest heat setting triggers the safety shutoff too soon to be useful for me.  And... The red indicator light is always on; although you can effectively put the heater in off mode, I prefer a power switch (true off state requires uplugging the heater).

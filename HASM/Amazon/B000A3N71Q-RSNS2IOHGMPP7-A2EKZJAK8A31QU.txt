Title: Like the idea, but product has issues
Content:
I love the look and the idea of the Creative Vision, but I've had quite a few problems with mine, and it's only a month or so old.  First, the device kept freezing up when I plugged it into the computer.  I finally figured out that the USB cable was faulty.  So then I got another USB cable that's OK.  So then it worked fine for a month or so, at which point, now it's started to freeze up for no reason.  A few days ago, it just froze when I was viewing photos on it.  Today, it froze when I plugged it into a computer under its flash drive function.  When it's not having any problems, it's a beautiful device, and I love it.  But it's flaws are disappointing...

Title: Terrific little vacuum!
Content:
This is a surprisingly powerful and useful vacuum. Not only does it work on hardwood floors; it has a long enough pole to get at cobwebs on a nine-foot high ceiling. We ordered this vacuum to supplement a full-size vacuum during the renovation of a 175-year-old house and ended up using it for everything except the rugs. It has very strong suction and is easy to maneuver due to its lengthy cord. Emptying the dirt container is simple and quick; do it outside to minimize the impact of any escaping dust. Except for its unsuitability for carpets (the rug tool doesn't seem to be very effective), this terrific vacuum would have earned 5 stars. It's a definite buy, especially at this price.

Title: A new K-cup addict to the fold...
Content:
My first single cup maker... it's so nice to have a fresh, hot, quality cup of coffee when ever I want it.
My wife and I have become K-Cup "addicts"... now completely spoiled and totally unwilling to ever go back to pot coffee.
If a bit of pump noise may bother you, I suggest upgrading to the B70 with "quiet brew" technology... if it's not a bother, the B60 is the most bang for your buck.

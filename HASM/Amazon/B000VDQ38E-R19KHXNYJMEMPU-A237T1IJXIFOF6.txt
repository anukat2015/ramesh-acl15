Title: overall a great product
Content:
My household has four cats and a dog.  I bought this vacuum over a year ago in the hopes that it would be able to manage the overwhelming amount of pet fur in my house.  Overall, this vacuum does suction up most of the fur as well as other materials which may accumulate around the house.  It works perfectly on carpet and all of the hand tools/attachments are simply fantastic.  However its shortcoming is bare floors.  I feel like the vacuum sort of glides over the floors while minimally sucking up anything.  We have both linoleum and hard wood floors, and while the suction isn't horrible I often have to go over a specific area on the floor a couple of times.  
But overall, I really love this vacuum and although it may take a little while longer on bare floors, it still has relatively good suction and provides me with a fur free house.

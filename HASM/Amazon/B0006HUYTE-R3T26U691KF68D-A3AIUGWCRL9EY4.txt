Title: Great little vac
Content:
So far, so good. I've had this vacuum for about 1 month and I'm happy with it.  I have hardwood, area rugs and wall to wall and it works fine on all. I also have two cats and it is doing a fine job of picking up the fur both from the floors and my furniture. If it lasts me a few years I will consider it a good buy!

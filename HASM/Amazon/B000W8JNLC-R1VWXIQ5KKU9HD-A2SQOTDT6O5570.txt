Title: China Standard, not for US standard LP propane
Content:
This one is very large burner. It does get rusty if you leave it outside with rain. We received a package which includes a "72"L x 5/8" outside diameter LP hose with regulator & brass fitting for leak-free connection". This LP hose and its gas regulator are useless. We came out to buy US regulator hose, but it does not fit into this burner. Not be able to find and LP hose to fit in this burner. We do not recomment this product. We finally find one at SportAuthority,DICK or HarborFreight with fit our US hose.

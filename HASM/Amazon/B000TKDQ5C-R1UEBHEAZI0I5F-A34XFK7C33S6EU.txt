Title: My room is as cold as a refrigerator.
Content:
I bought this heater because my room gets really cold at night, and this heater had high ratings on Amazon. 
This heater warms my room sufficiently well, but not as well as I had hoped. It is very noisy, and produces a foul odor when running. However, this heater is relatively cheap and small.

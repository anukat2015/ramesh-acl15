Title: Unbelievable...
Content:
I have owned 3 Canon digital cameras and thought my S1 was the bomb.  It is, however, this thing is unbelievable.  It is so responsive and fast that I could hardly believe how quickly I could shoot photo after photo at the highest resolution.  I got the all black and some say they feel cheap when you hold them.  I think it feels awesome...but I have small hands and it fits perfectly.  The quality of the photos are fantastic, even with the stock lense.  I love this camera...the performance is incredible and it is a blast to use.  My poor S1 is gonna get lonely.

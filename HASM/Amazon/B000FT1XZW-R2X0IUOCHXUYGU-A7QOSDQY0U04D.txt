Title: Takes a long time to heat a room
Content:
I put this heater in a small bedroom. It is very slow to heat the room. You have to turn it on a couple of hours before you go to bed. And be sure to close the door to the room. If your house is drafty this heater probably won't satisfy you. Don't expect it to heat a large family room. It gets hot to touch and is absolutely silent.
Update (Two Months Later): It's working ok in a small bedroom 11x11. There are three settings. Turn the setting to #2 for an hour then turn down to #1 for all night. You can set it to maintain a specific setting. If I keep the bedroom door closed when sleeping, the room gets very warm. This heater is quiet...no noise except for a click when it cycles on.

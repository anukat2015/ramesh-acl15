Title: A Screaming i7 system....
Content:
If you're looking for a Windows-based, i7-chipped system.....then look no further.  This bad boy can cut through batch processes like nobody's business.  If you need a laptop to run Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom, this is a great system for that end.  The i7 chips are especially set up for that, and the multi-core threading will knock your socks off.  It can't do what my i7-860 desktop can do, but it can do more than my former suped-up Core 2 Duo desktop!
If you're looking for a simple system for basic internet, email, and word processing, then it's probably overkill.  But if you need a portable workhorse running Windows 7, then look no further!

Title: Great portable heat for a small to medium size room.
Content:
We have an electric furnace and a 2100 square foot two-level 1930s bungalow home.  We were tired of winter bills being $500-600 a month.  We bought two of these heaters, one for each bedroom.  Our bedrooms are fairly large and yet, within several minutes of turning the heaters on (in Econo Mode, with thermostat set at 72) the room is very comfortable.  Of course, being in Houston, we don't have wintery winters. The coldest it will likely get here is 28-35 degrees.  I think these heaters, for what we paid for them, are a bargain, and do exactly what we want.  We don't use most of the rooms in our house, other than kitchen, bath, bedrooms and upstairs office.  So heaters in each actively used room will significantly cut our heating bill.  The heaters are quiet, seem to cycle on and off appropriately, and the beauty is that they are on rollers, so one of the downstairs heaters gets rolled to the door of the bathroom for showering.  All in all, I am very pleased with the performance of these heaters and plan to get one more for my office upstairs.

Title: Not Charmed by our Third Braun
Content:
We purchased the KF590 coffeemaker because of our satisfaction with our existing Braun coffeemaker (and a previous one) and because its attractive black-and-stainless styling would look good in our newly redone kitchen.  It brewed coffee fairly quickly but the coffee had a strong metallic taste which moderated after about a month of use.  The push button basket release sometimes failed to release.  At other times the basket opened unexpectedly during the brewing cycle with disastrous results.  The unit required frequent cleaning to prevent the basket from overflowing during brewing.  But the most annoying failing was the carafe's automatic dribble feature.  Pouring the first cup of coffee was always an adventure.  Some of the coffee went into the cup but some ran down the pot onto the counter or tabletop.  After two months experience we retired the KF590 and replaced it with a Mr. Coffee.  It has attractive black-and-stainless styling also, but it makes tasty coffee without disasters and messes.

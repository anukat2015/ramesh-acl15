Title: Fantastic heater!
Content:
I bought this DeLonghi heater after I had to throw the Soleus panel heater in the garbage after finding it did NOTHING to heat a room. We bought the DeLonghi HHP1500 Mica Panel Radiator heater for a basement bedroom and it works GREAT. This is my son's bedroom and I didn't want a floor heater because he's not to be trusted to NOT throw clothing, paper, blankets or whatever on top of it. This heater was easily hung on the wall....which is PERFECT for a kid's room. We've used it for 2 winters now and it is more than sufficient for his bedroom. It gets nice and toasty in there. 
I highly recommend this heater and suggest, from experience, you stay away from the similar Soleus panel heater :).

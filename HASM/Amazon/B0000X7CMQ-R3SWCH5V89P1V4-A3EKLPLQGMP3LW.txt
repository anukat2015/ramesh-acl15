Title: Coffee Tastes OK but Maker Not Very Satisfying
Content:
We have used the Zojirushi EC-BD15 daily for a month or so.  The coffee it makes tastes fine.  However, the machine is too tall, it seems to be flimsy, it is not easy to pour in the water and see the measure at the same time, the coffee holder is too small for a #4 filter to fit into properly, the mechanism to pour from the thermal pot is inconvenient, and the removable top is in two parts, one of which will surely get lost soon.  Having used the pot for a month, I would not purchase it again.

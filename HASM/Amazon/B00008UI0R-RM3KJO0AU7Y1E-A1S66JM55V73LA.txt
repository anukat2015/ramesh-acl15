Title: This vacuum really sucks...in a good way!
Content:
Overall I love this vacuum.  It is much quieter than my Hoover upright.  Yes, the dirt cup requires emptying often.  But that's a good thing, right?  Means it's picking up more dirt! Doing stairs was a breeze compared to my upright.  But the best part is the powered mini nozzle.  I have 3 cats and a dark purple couch that used to take a good hour to clean.  Not anymore.  With the powered mini nozzle I had the couch cleaned in under 5 minutes.  That alone makes this vacuum worth it's price. Being able to adjust the airfloor on the handle is a plus.  If the carpet/floor powered head is attacking the carpet to agressively, just go to less suction.  It still cleans the carpet but makes it easier to push.  There are a few quirks.  Shorter cord then my upright(if the cord is not retracting as well as you would like, make sure the cord is all behind the machine and not tangled under the canister). Also the headlight is only on when vacuuming carpet, not bare floors.  I guess Hooover doesn't want you to see the dirt on hardwood? Lastly, there is no place on the machine to store the mini powered nozzle or the hard floor tool.  This vacuum has gotten me excited about cleaning again!!

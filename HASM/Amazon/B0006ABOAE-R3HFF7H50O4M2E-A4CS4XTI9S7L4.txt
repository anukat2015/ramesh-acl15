Title: Fantastic machine minus the frother.
Content:
My wife and bought this to replace a more expensive coffeeemaker that decided to quit working after just a year.  Since having the Mr. Coffee, we have been nothing short of impressed with its overall quality and ease of use.  The frother however, could be designed a bit better because it is difficult to get the cup under it while the machine sits on the counter.

Title: Great Camera
Content:
This camera is awesome.  Took it out of the box, loaded my card and bam...taking great pictures.  The clarity is incredible.  Right now I am taking everything with the autofocus which works great.  I can't wait to see what cool stuff I can do when I learn to manually do somethings.  One thing that I did play with is the shutter speed...I took a picture of my floor fan that was running at high speed.  The picture clearly showed the fan blades (no blur nothing).  The picture made it appear that I took a picture of the fan when it was off.  How cool is that?

Title: zune 30 gb digital media player
Content:
The zune is overall a quality product. After unwrapping the lovely packaging, i was immediately impressed with the size of the screen. The zune plays video  flawlessly, and music is powerful and smooth. My only complaint with the zune is its battery life; I have discharged it(set it to shuffle all night long) and recharged it, only to get 8-9 hours use. Although 8-9 hours is plenty, i wish it came close to its advertised 15 or so. My other complaint is that the installer can be buggy(must have window's crappy internet explorer installed). The zune program itself can also die sometimes but this has led to no problems. Other than those mild issues, I am completely satisfied with my purchase, and i would still choose the zune over the ipod.

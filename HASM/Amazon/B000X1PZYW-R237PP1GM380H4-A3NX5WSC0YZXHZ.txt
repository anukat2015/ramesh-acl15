Title: A Positive Review
Content:
After reading all the negative reviews on this laptop I had to put my 2 cents in. I did notice most of the reviews were from 2009 and 2010. I bought mine in 2005 and have had none of the problems everybody mentions. I use it just about everyday and I've never had to replace anything on this unit. I work as a DJ and even use a program called "Virtual DJ" and have had no problems.Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones or maybe they were made better back in 2005.I do feel sorry for everyone who has had problems. I've had my share with my home computer (Gateway)I welcome any comments.

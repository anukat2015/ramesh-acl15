Title: Not a bad vacuum
Content:
The reason I ended up on this page is because I was looking for replacement parts for the Magic Blue vacuum. Bought it more than 2 years ago and found it and excellent vacuum for some $90, then. Now Sears has it for about $100. Amazon.com's $300+ must think we are in the Amazon with no other options.
The one star review that claims that the brush stopped turning after some 6 months is because he does not know that he needs  to CLEAN it of hair and strings that spool up on the brush and get it stuck. The brush is not motor driven but turbine driven from the vacuum suction. The vacuum is a very good machine, extremely flexible and the low hardwood sweeper profile allows access under most furniture, from all angles. I never owner super expensive vacuum cleaners, but this one beats by far a $300+ upright I had. After 2 years the canister/vacuum is still in its original working performance, wand had stuck (it normally is adjustable lenght), hardwood sweeper is coming apart, handle with switch broke when I dropped it on the floor too many times but I redesigned it and made it break proof. Carpet sweeper as good as new. I am ready to buy another one if I can't find the hardwood floor sweeper replacement (its swivel bushing has worn out and is not repairable). I might attach a video sometime to show the relative simple way to reinforce the handle and prevent breaking.
Cons? a little too loud but for the size, easy to carry along and the suction power it's got to be

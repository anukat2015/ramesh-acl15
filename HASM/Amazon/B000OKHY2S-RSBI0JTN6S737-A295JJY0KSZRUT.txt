Title: Relief from the HEAT!
Content:
I wasn't sure about purchasing this unit, but now I'm very happy I did!  After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure what to really expect but this unit is great to cool off to.  As mentioned in other reviews, it is NOT an air conditioning unit, but it does cool you off by about 10 degrees.  It does not provide very cold air, but for me it is just enough to keep me comfortable.  The timer feature is great to fall asleep to and the swing feature is nice to keep the cool air circulating.

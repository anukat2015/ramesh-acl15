Title: whats up with the nozzle function and Bare Floor selection?
Content:
This vac is good if all you want to do is vacuum a rug/carpet - don't expect much if you want to use the nozzle attachment or on hard surfaces. I bought this vac because I have a Sheltie and German Shepard and it was recommended as a good vac for homes with pets. I immediately noticed a lot more dust around and this morning as I was using the nozzle to do the hardwood floor (because you can't use the regular vac on hardwood because nothing really gets picked up) I could see the dust particles and dog hair shooting into the air from the tube that the nozzle rests in when using the regular vac. Don't bother using this machine on hard surfaces - all it does is shoot the stuff out the back onto your feet and around the area - even if you select "Bare Floor" on the height selector the beater never stops and everything just sprays all over. Very disappointing.

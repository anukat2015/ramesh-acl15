Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
I have been very happy with this vacuum.  The bagless feature is great as this is my first vacuum without a bag.  I find the suction excellent and the cord long enough and the abilty to move the canister around effortless.  I would not suggest this vacuum to someone with a lot of carpet.  I have hard wood floors in my entire home.  I have two area rugs and the vacuum does a good job but is excellent on my hard wood.

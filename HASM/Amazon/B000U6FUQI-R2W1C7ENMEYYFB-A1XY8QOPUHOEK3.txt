Title: I'd say this vacuum-cleaner sucks (except that it doesn't)...
Content:
During a recent shopping trip, my pre-schooler found himself enthralled with this futuristic-looking vacuum cleaner.  He tried pushing it around in the store and decided that this was the right cleaning tool for his play-room.  So, despite the hefty price tag (as compared to most light-weight stick vacs), I bought it. Well, that was a mistake.  This vacuum cleaner is a joke. It can't even pick up little bits of paper.  I had anyway planned to use it just for tiny clean-up jobs; but was disappointed that it  couldn't even handle those.  Admire the form; but beware the function. In other words: DO NOT BUY!

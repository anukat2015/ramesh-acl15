Title: Nix on the Bagless
Content:
This vacuum is quite adequate for picking up dust off hardwood floors and cleaning our oriental rugs.  It is reasonably quiet, especially on the lowest levels.  We found the handle difficult to use for dusting high places, such as over doors and our mantel, and for going into crevices.  We had to buy additional hose in order to reach high places.  We feel the bagless feature is not a boone.  The dust receptacle is small and has to be emptied and cleaned after every vacuuming.  It's a dusty, messy chore.  On our old upright, changing a bag was much easier, cleaner, and needed to be done less frequently.  We would not buy this vacuum again.

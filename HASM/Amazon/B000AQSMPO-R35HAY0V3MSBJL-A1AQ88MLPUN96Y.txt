Title: Best gift ever!  I love it!
Content:
This machine simplifies getting ready in the morning!  The Green Mountain line of K-cups is the best I've tried.  Most every store in Vermont sells Green Mountain coffee and every flavor I've tried is excellent.  I use this machine a few times a day.  Without the K-cup it will make hot water for oatmeal, a cup of tea, hot cocoa, etc.  It's extremely simple to use - just add water and push a button.  You can set it up to turn on/off at a certain time of day.  The blue light that shines through the water reservoir is a nice touch for a Kitchen appliance.

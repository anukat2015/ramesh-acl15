Title: Good for rugs but hard to push
Content:
I wanted a compact vac to occasionally deep-clean rugs.  I've had this vac several months and it absolutely does the job. As other reviewers have noted, it picks up a lot of dirt, lint, cat hair, etc.; also it is well-made, out of quality material.  
Drawbacks: (1) it is so hard to push around I keep looking for some hidden brake mechanism that I need to unlock (if there is one, or some way to make the wheels turn easily, would someone post a comment on it?).  It doesn't do corners, under stuff, or anything for which you need a hose such as shelves, so can't be your only vac.
Good when combined with a robot-vacuum for bare floors and a hand-held for pillows, shelves, etc.

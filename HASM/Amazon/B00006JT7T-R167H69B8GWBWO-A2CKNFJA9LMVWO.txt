Title: Problem w/ Manufacturing????
Content:
I think I received a lemon too.  I bought this same brand at a store and the fan was not mounted properly.  I returned that one.  I bought the same one here on Amazon and when I got it, I noticed that not much air was coming out.  I looked from behind the unit and one of the fan blades was broken off.  Returning the one I bought at Amazon back too.  I definitely think it is not the retailers fault...it's a manufacturing/assembly defect/problem.

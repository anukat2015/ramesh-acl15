Title: too noisy and Sharp customer services bites
Content:
This unit is advertised as being very quiet, however they neglect to mention one thing: when it starts up and shuts down it's VERY LOUD.  What's the point of having a unit run quietly when it makes an unacceptably loud noise every few minutes as the compressor kicks in?  Yeah, once the compressor's running it's fairly quiet -- but it's loud enough to wake me up from across the room (and I am NOT a light sleeper).
Because I didn't want the hassle of returning it, I kept the unit, and it broke down after 2 months of moderate use.
So, yes, it cools as advertised - but who cares when it breaks down and is so loud in spurts?
And good luck trying to get service from Sharp...I am still waiting for service to get the damned thing fixed.
Don't buy this unit unless you want problems!

I own a 2gb ipod nano and I love it! Here's a list of pros and cons-
Pros- very small + portible
      stylish (for those who really care)
      holds a good amount of songs (500 or 1000)
      great quality sound
      bright and legible screen
      fun games and features
Cons- more fragile than a mini
      sumdges EXTREMELY easily (something that drives me   insane, even thouh I have a case)
       
all in all, this is THE BEST mp3 player for a person with a $250 or less budget and cares more about size than capacity. When I took my new nano out of its box my mother gaped at it and said, "That's it!? I paid how much for what?!" (One must hold a nano to appericiate its size)She has since gotten over her shock.

Title: Beautiful, brown Zune 30 gigs
Content:
The brown Zune was on sale for 89.00 at Amazon and I jumped on it and haven't been sorry in the least. It truly is worth the asking price. It's a beautiful piece, heavy enough to know you're holding something precious. The music is devine! I am listening to music I'd had on my pc or on CDs and am hearing notes I never heard before! Many sound like new music. I'm in love. love. love! My phoots are so clear and bright! This is a Chrismas present to myself and, boy, did I buy the right thing! I had an iriver 1 gig mp3 player and was happy with that, but Zune tops that by far. I am not an ipod fan and have no interest in it, but when the Zune was announced, I was ready to buy, but the cost was prohibitive, I thought. Since I purchased this one on sale, I really got a steal and am very happy. I read the review by an apparent "techie" who compared Zune unfavorably to the Ipod. I say, if you want an ipod, buy it...but the Zune results in love, love, love - of your old music, new music, your photos -everything!!! 
As soon as I settle down, I'll get into the rest of the Zune. For now, I'm happy! Helen

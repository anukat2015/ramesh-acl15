Title: A good, full function thermostat
Content:
This unit represents a good value.  It has lots of thoughtful features, such as a button to tell it that you are home for the day and want the heat to stay on, and a meter than tells you how many hours of heat you have been using.  It also offers plenty of programming flexibility that you would have to pay more for with products from other manufacturers.
I also use the backlit 5-2 Honeywell.  The Honeywell costs more, has fewer features, and in my view, at least, is not meaningfully easier to program, and is certainly no easier to use on a daily basis.  I felt the Hunter had better installation instructions.  The Honeywell's biggest strength is that it is smaller.  Using it, I often find myself wishing it had some of the features found on the Hunter.
My biggest gripe with this Hunter model is that the backlight makes an annoying, high pitch noise.  It is also a little too large for my taste.  Dollar for dollar, though, versus the competition, this is money well spent.

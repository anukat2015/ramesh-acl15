Title: Updated Review
Content:
Update - 1-8-2010 -- There is a way to use this so that it is somewhat effective.  One needs to turn it on about an hour before needing it.  If the panel is located under your desk, so that it's in a relatively enclosed area, and if it's allowed to heat the air there for an hour or so, it does indeed help with the chill. It's not great, but it is a help.  I would now give it three stars rather than the two of the first review.

I should have paid more attention to J. Tunnell's review. It is spot on.  This panel delivers very little heat. I once had a panel that delivered more and assumed this one would be similar. So read  J. Tunnell's review at least twice.  Believe it.  If you then order this, you've only yourself to blame.

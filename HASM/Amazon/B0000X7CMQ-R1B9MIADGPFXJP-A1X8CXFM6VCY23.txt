Title: Very pleased with the coffee. Not pleased with the stains the rubber pieces leave on my white counter.
Content:
Makes very good coffee that's very hot (not sure what the other reviewer is complaining about there). However my review is more here as a warning to anyone that has white countertops (like the Corian ones) at home. This coffee maker has a non-skid bottom (for all those times your coffee maker goes flying off the counter, I guess?!?) that has these black rubber circles and if there is any water whatsoever under the machine which happens when you pour water in, it leaves little permanent circle marks all over my countertop. I've scrubbed with scouring powder and they've come off a bit, but not all the way. Oh well. So be warned if you have the same counters. Otherwise, I'd give it four stars.

Title: Great Coffee, Overflows
Content:
This coffee maker makes great coffee. However, it often overflows the basket (water flow too fast for rate of drip). I have to babysit it while the coffee brews. To prevent an overflow and ruined pot of coffee, I turn the machine off about 3/4 of the way through, wait a minute, and then turn it back on. This works and the coffee is perfect, but after 2 years of this, I am tired of being a baby sitter. It overflows with both paper filters and a permanent gold filter. I like my coffee strong and use a fine grind, which may contribute to my issue. However, I used the same grind on my previous coffee maker, and it did not overflow. One extra piece of information: I live at high altitude (7800 ft), so perhaps the resulting lower boiling point of water is causing the water to flow faster. In any event, I am shopping for a new coffee maker so I can make coffee without having to be a babysitter. Also, I am tired of having to make another pot when I get distracted and the coffee maker overflows.

Title: Quality vacuum
Content:
Have this vacuum for about a month, and are very happy with the purchase.
The good:
1. It is quiet
2. Did I mention it is quiet? 
3. It is very small, the canister measures about 40 cm * 25 cm * 25 cm
   (I use centimeter [cm] because it is a German product ); 25 cm approx.= 10" )
4. It 'sucks' the hell out of my carpet );
The not so good:
1. The power cord could be a bit longer (5.5 m or 18 ft).
All in all, being quiet, small and powerful were the properties I was looking for. The not too long cord is no problem in my case, since there are enough outlets in the house.

Title: Great Idea, but poor design. Grounds everywhere!
Content:
Purchased this item and and it worked fine for a few weeks. Then it started to overflow the grounds outside of the basket and into the water tank, water spreader and into the cup of coffee. Black and Decker replaced the coffee basket but that did not help, when I called them back they offered to send a "refurbished" replacement for $7.50 (the original price for the brand new unit was only $15) if I sent them back a piece of the power cord. And if the replacement unit does the same thing, then I would only have $22.50 in a non-useable unit. No thanks! I would suggest you stay away from this item.

Title: It's all about image quality
Content:
The FX difference in low noise, combined with true wide-angle capability, make the D700 a winner.
My Nikon history includes F, F2, F3, F5, Fuji S2, D200, D300, and now D700. Compared to the D300, this one feels heavier and the maximum FPS is certainly slower. But mated to the 14-24mm f2.8 lens (watch out for flare) it is a dream with great image quality with low noise up to at least ISO 3200. I've been using the combination to good advantage shooting real estate.
A feature I missed in earlier Nikon DSLRs that has returned to the D700 is the eyepiece shutter. The connector covers have also been improved. The dedicated INFO button is quite handy and the new way of opening the CF compartment is no problem.
Because I sometimes shoot hand-held bracket sets for HDR, I contemplated adding the vertical grip for added FPS capability. But after I hefted the body alone, I remembered why I don't miss my old F5.
Overall it's a great camera and worth owning even if it has been out for a while.

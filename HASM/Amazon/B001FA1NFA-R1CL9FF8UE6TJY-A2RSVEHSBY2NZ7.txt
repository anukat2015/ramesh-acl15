Title: Sucky New Hardware
Content:
This iPod may look sleek & cool but I don't understand why Apple would make a gadget that would cause inconvenience to people. Since the hardware is new, none of the speakers or chargers for the older generation iPods we have works on this. The only way to charge this iPod is by plugging its usb to the computer. It won't charge on our Bose, iHome, car charger, or even the cheaper speakers we have. I pity my son. Got this gadget for him.

Title: STOP SYNCING!!!!
Content:
Surprise surprise, microsoft makes another problem, i mean- product and whats wrong with it...the software.  The zune software is HORRIBLE.  It took everything from my hard drive, i have like 30 instructional videos that i dont need in my pocket and it synced ALL of them.  What's worse, I deleted them from the library, and the next time i started up the program, its synced them AGAIN!  It takes the Zune about 20 min each time I attached it to sync to my computer.  I have been an ipod owner for the last 4 years and I LOVE them as much as I love itunes.  The zunes menu system is unintuitive and options are difficult to adjust.  I hope this so called godsend of an update that Microsoft is releasing will improve the functionality of their half-wit product.

Title: Canon T1i camera
Content:
I have used the camera for a couple of weeks now and it more than meets my expectations.  My old camera is Canon XT and it good but this one is great.  I especially like the live view and the video modes.  The view screen is fantastic.  I didn't like that I had to switch from Compact Flash cards to SDHC cards but they are so cheap now that it is not a big deal.

Title: Great camera - looks good in white
Content:
I had/have many digital cameras but for the short time I tried this one, it is a keeper. The settings and menues are nice - the low light quality is great. Even the lens is great - especially for being a "kit" lens. The color (I have the white one) is great - very different and makes it look smaller and less scary than regular DSLR. It is light, small, fits well in hand, controls are at the right positions, it has live view and sensor image stabilization that works well. A great, great camera - especially for people new to DSLR.

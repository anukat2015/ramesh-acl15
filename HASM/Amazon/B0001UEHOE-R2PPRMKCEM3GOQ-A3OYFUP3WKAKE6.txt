Title: Don't pass it up
Content:
I decided to purchase this mp3 player after giving heavy consideration to the iRiver and iAudio players. My primary reason for picking this player was that at the time that I bought it, Amazon had it at a special sale price of $82.99. That's less than how much you have to pay to get a 128 MB iriver or iAudio player.
I received this player a couple of days ago and have been playing with it since. I didn't install the software but plugged the player straight into my Computer and uploaded songs. My computer unfortunately doesn't support USB 2.0 so the transfer was slow, so I would recommend that you check if your computer supports USB 2.0 or not. If it doesn't, the MuVo NX is a cheaper alternate option. I uploaded my songs in folders since they are organized in albums. I was able to fit 3 full albums and 10 more miscellaneous songs, mostly ripped at 192kbps. I feel that the LCD screen and the controls are a bit too small, but I was able to get used to them and did like the scroll-wheel feature. 
The MuVo is feature-packed. It provides standard repeat and shuffle features, has a customizable equalizer, a voice recorder, the ability to skip from folder to folder, and set various screen options. The sound was excellent when I set the equalizer to my liking. I listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, so I cranked up the bass, and even using the included headphones the music sounded great. The included ear-phones did sound decent and sounded better than comparable stock-headphones. I'm still waiting for my Senn PX100 headphones to arrive.
Overall, this is an excellent little player. I was amazed at how small and light it is, and it is extremely convenient to carry it around. I would definately recommend this.

Title: Great for pets!!
Content:
I bought this vacuum hoping it will at least pick up the cat hair in our place.  It does way more then that!!! I vacuum every other day and it always   seems to keep picking up all sorts of stuff hidden in the carpets! It's bagless and easy to remove dirt.  Comes with all types of attachments for your furniture.  It was shipped fast and easy to put together.

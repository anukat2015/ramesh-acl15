Title: Heats just as well as a $75 heater.
Content:
Living in the snow belt of NY state and using space heaters as the main source of heat in my home for the last few winters, I know a thing or two about them. I haven't been able to afford a heating oil delivery, so naturally, I turned to electric heat.
 My first heater purchase was a highly rated $75 radiant heater  which was alright, except it was pretty darn big, and the heat it provided seemed so-so for the price I paid. The next one was a $50 bionaire heater which was still rather large and so-so for the price I paid. 
Being on a budget, my next two heaters were this particular one. I love how small they are, and it can get downright HOT, even on the coldest nights if you don't have it on medium/low. I had them running almost on a constant basis for 6 months, 2 years running, and this is the third year and have had no issues with them quitting on me. I did go and buy them from a physical store, so maybe bad handling was the case with others who had a problem with it.
 Anyway, on the subject of electric bills, mine were pretty high. A winter of electric bills was pretty much equivalent to a winters worth of heating oil, but at least I didn't have to pay that in a lump sum, up front.

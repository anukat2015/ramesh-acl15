Title: Voranado needs to redo this model!!!!
Content:
I have owned Voranado products before and have been very happy with them...but this Digital Display model needs help!I had the same issues as another reviewer...I would set the temp for 75 and it would show a room temp of 85 - just for kicks we set the temp to 85 and it showed a room temp of 95 ! And there is no way that was the actual room temp !I didn't read the reviews, as I should have - So I requested a replacement instead of a refund. I received it, took it out of the box and the front fell off ! -The screws that hold on the front housing are missing!!!!! 2 defective units from the same company makes me very concerned.  I love the thought of a digital display, but obviously they need to work the bugs out. I hope they do a recall, these units seem dangerous - judging by some of the other reviews.

Title: Neat toy, but defective
Content:
Received my new iPod nano and was pleased with the radio, camera, pedometer, sound quality and appearance. However, the backlight wouldn't turn off, no matter how many seconds I set it for, draining the battery very quickly. Also, since Apple reconfigured the nano, it couldn't be docked in my old, excellent, speaker (which cost more than my old and new nano combined). This is disappointing to say the least. If Apple sees the need to reconfigure, why not provide an adapter that the consumer could purchase, enabling the old accessories to work.

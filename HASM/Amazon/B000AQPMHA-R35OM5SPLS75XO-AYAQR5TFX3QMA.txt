Title: I love my Keurig!!!
Content:
Well, so far I'm addicted to my Keurig. It is incredibly convenient and makes better coffee than I was getting with whole bean coffee, burr-grinding fresh every morning, and using a french press with carefully controlled water temperature. The best part is, no clean-up! In fact, the primary reason we bought it was because we were tired of starting every single day with dirty dishes in the sink. After tasting about fifteen different k cups, I feel certain that anyone can find a k cup they like out of the over 200 choices. So far, my fave is Coffee People, Donut Shop. It is very easy drinking, but full-bodied and flavorful (as far as coffee goes) at the same time. Regarding the comments on noise in several of the reviews, the noise from my machine seems very normal to me. But I have never had an auto-drip machine and I was used to a burr grinder going off every morning, so anything would probably sound quiet to me. The Keurig's definitely not going to wake anybody up. (If your machine is waking up the house it sounds like something is wrong). I highly recommend the Keurig to anyone. If all you have ever had is pre-ground Folgers, you really need to wake up to fresh coffee, you will never go back. If it last me two years, I will definitely jump up to a five star rating. Well worth the $90 I paid for it. My only problem is that I want to drink more coffee than I used to. I'm determined not to increase my 1 cup a day habit, but the Keurig is making it tough.

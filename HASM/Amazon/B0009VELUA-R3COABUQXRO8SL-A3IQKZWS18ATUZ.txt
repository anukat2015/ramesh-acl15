Title: Great cup of coffee
Content:
We love this coffeemaker.  It makes a great tasting cup of coffee right to the last cup which never tastes burnt or old.  I've had a couple of different friends that were over to visit and fell in love with this maker.  They went out and bought it to0.  I've read comments on it's a bit troublesome to fill with water.  I use the section in the machine that holds the coffee. Once I clean it I refill it with fresh water and pour into the machine, we use the side with the flap and the water pours into the machine with no problems...  Excellent machine... Highly recommended...

Title: love it
Content:
It sits in a corner of the counter, doesn't take up much space, easy to clean, delivers a hot cup of coffee in about 1 1/2 minutes or less (that's faster than a Bun!). I'm not a coffee hound, so this is perfect for me, & I don't end up throwing out left-over coffee. The average-sized coffee cup fits in it, & that's what keeps the cost low, by the customer providing their own cup (any coffee-drinker has several anyway). thanks for a great product!

Title: Finally!
Content:
Finally, a coffeemaker that works and is easy to operate.  It's clean too, no nooks and crannies to gunk up with coffee residue.  The blue light is nice at night, it alluminates the kitchen just enough, so that i won't run into anything.  But most of all the coffee is brewed to perfection everytime.  I have used it at least 20 times and it's a breeze to clean.  I love this machine.  thank you.

Title: Good quality dSLR camera.
Content:
The camera is quite nice. It has a number of point-and-shoot modes available to the photographer. I use them sometimes if I don't have time to compose the shot. Most of the time I use the M mode.
I do not want to be redundant in my praise - please read all the other 5 star posts.
Here are the few items I found a little unpleasant but are not a show stopper.
1. Small viewfinder: it is quite difficult for me to manually focus through the viewfinder without the help of the seven focusing points. You can either focus manually by eye sight, or press the shutter halfway in order to trigger the focusing points while manually focusing on the object desired. I don't think the instructions manual describes using the auto focus points while in manual focus mode.
2. The aperture button is not placed as conveniently - it's right next to the LCD screen. It would be more intuitive if it was in a location for easy thumb access.
3. The kit lens is really flimsy. The front part actually is wobbly while in manual focus mode.

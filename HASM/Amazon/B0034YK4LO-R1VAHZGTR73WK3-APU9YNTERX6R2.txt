Title: no better than my $44 wal-mart heater
Content:
save your money. i put this in a 350 square foot room and it can not heat it up over 58 degrees.
mine does not have any fan setting,unlike what was stated in the item description. this heater is worth $50 and might heat up a bathroom(as long as it is not a big bathroom)
I DID SEND THIS ITEM BACK AND EVERYONE I SPOKE WITH WAS VERY NICE AND MY REFUND WAS PROMPTLY RECIEVED. GREAT SELLER !

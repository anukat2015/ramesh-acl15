Title: Defective ON/OFF switch
Content:
I bought a VH2 for an infants room.
It worked very well for a while.
Then the ON/OFF switch stopped working.
It is stuck in the ON position.
It can not be shut off unless it is unplugged.
This thing is a fire hazard.
I was lucky that I shut it off in time before it started a fire in our baby's room.
I called the Vornado company but they want $25 plus shipping to fix it.
All it needs is the switch.
I asked if I could just send back the control panel.
I am an electrician.
Not worth it!
I will never buy another Vornado product again.
They use cheap parts made in asia and then want to rip you off to fix it.
Why are so many electronic items made to just be disposable.
If it was just made with better quality it would last more than a couple of uses.

Title: Heats my downstairs!!
Content:
I had to write a review on this heater.  It is excellent!  I have been bragging to family members since I got this and on Friday one of my sisters came over and experienced it for herself.  She finally asked if this is what I'd been telling them about.  She thought we had on the central heat and it was only this heater.  When I told her we didn't she asked me to order her one when I order my 2nd one.  
We live in a 2 story home and the downstairs never seems to warm anywhere near how well upstairs does. This year we have had some exceptionally cold weather. I'm a Florida native and I like my home very warm and cozy when it's cold outside. I usually have this heater set on 80 or 85.  Only when the room begins to get hot do I ever put it on 75 or 70. 
We have a large dining and family room combo and an eat-in kitchen.  This heater heats this entire area very nicely in not a lot of time.  I close off the bedroom and half bath when we are all in the kitchen or family room.  It will heat our master bed and bath in about 25 - 30 minutes.  If you want to get a good heater for your money, this is a great investment.  I'm very skeptical and my family considers me very frugal so please know that this is coming from the heart!.

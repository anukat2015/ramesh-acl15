Title: Amazon sent me a re-conditioned unit!
Content:
Let me start by saying I LOVE Amazon.  They've treated me very well and saved me a bundle of money over the years.
But.... this time I'm angry.   I bought this item last week and Amazon sent me a re-conditioned unit with a 90 day warranty (instead of one year) without telling me.  Nowhere on the item description on the Amazon web site does it say that they're selling re-conditioned units.
I haven't tried out the heater yet (other than to make sure that it works) so I don't have an opinion on the quality of the item - I'm just upset with Amazon

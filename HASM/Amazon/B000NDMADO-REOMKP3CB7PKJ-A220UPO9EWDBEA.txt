Title: My Favorite!!!
Content:
I started using the Dyson canister in England about 7 years ago.  Moved to USA in 2005 and bought an Dyson upright.  It was good, but I missed my canister.  Finally, the time was right and and I bought my DC 21 canister at Sears!  It helps so much with dirt, dust, and cat hair!  Highly recommend to others!

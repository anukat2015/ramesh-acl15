Title: Just what I needed!
Content:
I drink coffee, hubby doesn't.  So I'd use a regular pot to only make enough for me, resulting in having to wash the pot AND the travel mug every day (I LOVE the mugs also).  Now I just have to wash one mug a day AND they can go in the dishwasher!  You can use existing mugs too if you watch and make sure they fit and don't spill.  This is totally worth it for everyday use and a really great price.

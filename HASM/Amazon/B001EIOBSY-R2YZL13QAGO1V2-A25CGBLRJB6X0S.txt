Title: Great way to Display & Organize your K-Cups
Content:
Although I overpaid for this product online I am extremely happy with my purchase (I just saw this same item at Target for far less then what I paid +shipping...  so sad.  Look for it in Kitchen Appliances nearby (or) mixed in with other coffee makers).  
I originally considered the 'xmas tree/wire frame' style K-cup Carousel but I think this is a better product.  It's very sturdy, holds an impressive 30 k-cups, takes up minimal counter space, rotates 'smoothly' (something I read the xmas tree style carosel does not do very well), and matches our Black and Silver Keurig coffee maker.

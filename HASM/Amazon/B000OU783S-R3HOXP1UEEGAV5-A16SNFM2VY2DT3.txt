Title: UI? What UI?
Content:
This is a sad little MP3 player.  It doesn't hold nearly 500 songs (at the lowest WMP setting it holds more like 200), and the menu is just plain awful.  After fiddling with it for a long time, I think I have it mastered, but as a previous reviewer noted, don't expect something intuitive like iPod's.  I really do hope my return is accepted--I should have spent the extra money on a brand name in the first place.

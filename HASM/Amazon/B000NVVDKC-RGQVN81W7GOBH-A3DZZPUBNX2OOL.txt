Title: good starting DSLR camera
Content:
If you want to learn DSLR photography, you buy this one. None of the auto setup would give you good result means you are forced to learn the details abt photography to some extent. Interestingly, all the manual setups if you even get close to perfect wld give an outstanding result. The price is reasonable too. The kit lenses are good for starters.

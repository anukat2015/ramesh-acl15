Title: This is a Real nice camera for the Money
Content:
I am not a professional Photographer, I was using Canon Rebel 2000 before this camera.
This a very nice quality camera for everyday use, Takes real nice pictures and easy to USE. The feature I like most about this camera is the Auto Sensor Cleaning.
Still have all the controls like the Rebel 2000, actually better controls then the Rebel 2000.
I really like this camera and will definitely recommend it to the people like me who have photography as hobby.
Thanks CANON

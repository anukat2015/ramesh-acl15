Title: Works great for us.
Content:
I can only speak for myself, but I love this heater.  I can't promise it will work great for you, but we have it in a sitting room upstairs that has radiator heat.  We keep the furnace turned down to save money, and heat only a few rooms to a comfortable temperature, and this keeps the sitting room nice and toasty, even on the coldest of days.  As I write this, it's about 0 degrees outside and we're very comfortable in this room.

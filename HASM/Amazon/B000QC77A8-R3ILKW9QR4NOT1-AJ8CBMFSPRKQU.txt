Title: top of the line for plug in electric heaters!
Content:
I heat my whole house with plug in heaters, as my central furnance went out 2 years ago. I bought many brands and models and this Lasko has it all.
Very hot ceramic heat, quiet, temp control, timer shut off and hi and lo heat settings.
One feature that I like is you can move the heater vent, from str8 up to pointing right even to a little ways blowing downwards.
It's a expenive model, but for electric heaters, this model has it all and is the best you can buy hands down.

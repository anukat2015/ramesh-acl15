Title: Second Choice Camera, but Pretty Darn Good
Content:
Originally I wanted to buy the Nikon d300, but the price was just a tad out of my range, since this was my first dslr, after a lifetime of Nikon SLRs. The d90 performs well; so far I have no complaints, except the plastic body feels a little "chintzy" after my sturdy metal Nikons of the past. The images are acceptable, although this is my first time using a zoom lens, and I may be prejudiced in favor of the sharpness of prime lenses. When using the "P" mode, I found turning the aperture wheel a bit awkward. The d90 is a great option for photographers who are in between amateur and pro, and will make a good "extra" camera for professionals. I'm looking forward to getting a full frame dslr when the cost is right. Lens choices are complex due to the smaller frame of the d90: buy cheaper DX lenses, or pay the tariff on better lenses that will fit a future camera, too? If you're vacillating, don't fear the d90, just know it's not quite pro quality, but good bang for the buck spent.

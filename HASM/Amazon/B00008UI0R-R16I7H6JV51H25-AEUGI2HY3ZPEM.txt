Title: Great Vacuum for the price
Content:
I bought this vacuum about three weeks ago, as a replacement for a Dirt Devil upright that I had had for several years.  Overall, it has been a great vacuum so far.
Pros:  Great suction power, that is variable depending on what you are using it for.  We have 2 cats and a dog, and it does a great job of picking up the pet hair off the hardwood floors and the furniture.  It's lightweight, and fairly easy to maneuver around.  The powered hand attachment is great for cloth furniture, and it makes getting pet hair off a breeze.  
Cons:  The vacuum does tend to get stuck on its own cord if you are trying to roll it over the cord using the front wheel first.  That can be annoying on hardwood floors when you are trying to do a quick clean up.  To get the hardwood floor attachment to stay on well, you have to depress the lock button that is made for the carpet sweeper attachment.  The hardwood floor attachment does not actually lock, but in order for it to stay on well, you have to push it over the button.  Lastly, the carpet sweeper is very powerful...a great pro if you have carpet.  I have only rugs and it tends to be too much power for them, and sucks them up into the beaters.   But, it's not enough of a distractor for me to worry about.  
Overall, great buy for the price and features you get.  I would definitely buy this vacuum again.

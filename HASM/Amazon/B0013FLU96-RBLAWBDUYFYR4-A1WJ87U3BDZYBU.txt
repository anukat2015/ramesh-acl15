Title: MacBook Pro MB134 laptop - review
Content:
The MacBook Pro (MB134LL) is my first Apple product (purchased Dec 2008)and I am extremely happy with it. I have always purchased Toshiba laptops (3 in total) and have no complaints towards Toshiba. The MB134 resolution is extremely bright in comparison to my Toshiba. I have yet to hear the fan running, the boot up is lighting fast, the immediate ease in switching from PC to MAC was a breeze. I have not experienced any problems that other reviewers of MacBook Pros have experienced. I'm happy with my "MacBaby". DRJohnson - Maryland (USA)

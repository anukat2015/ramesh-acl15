Title: Nikon is truly better than Canon
Content:
I purchased my Nikon at Best Buy because I wanted a hands on with the Canon Rebel XT and Nikon D50. The first thing I noticed about Canon lenses is they seem to have a foggy coat as opposed to the Nikon lens which is very clear and provides you with the crystal clear image you want from digital photos. The Canon is heavy and the lenses are much larger in diameter as opposed to the Nikon with the D50 it's lightweight and the lenses are a petite size which will not make you feel like you are holding and extremely large unecessarily bulky camera. The functions with any camera on the Canon and Nikon are enough to make you go a little crazy but when I purchased my Nikon I bought Nikon - Digital Field Guide which I highly recommend. 
I highly recommend anyone who is a novice and wanting to delve into photography for a serious hobby or even for the fun of just having a great camera should consider the Nikon D50.

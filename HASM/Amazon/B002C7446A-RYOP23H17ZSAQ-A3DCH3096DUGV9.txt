Title: first mac
Content:
I bought this MacBook Pro for two reasons. The first was Vista and the second was my IPhone. Fed up with one and loved the other. This laptop is every thing my two year old HP wasn't, including a black screen when it didn't like the new virus program. It will take you a couple of days to get up to speed and then it's smooth sailing. There are extensive videos that show every aspect of "how to" on each program. If you are not a computer geek and you love your IPhone and had troubles with Vista, buy this MacBook Pro.

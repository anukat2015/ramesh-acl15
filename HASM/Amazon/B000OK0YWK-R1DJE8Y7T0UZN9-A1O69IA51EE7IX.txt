Title: Great present, tanks alot.
Content:
My parents got me this thing for my birthday, I don't know what possessed them but I cant stand the thing. I am a mac user and microsoft does not support mac OS X so I went into my garage to dig out my old PC which has an inch of dust on it and away I went trying to install zune software, First I started using windows XP again and remembered why I switched to mac OS in the first place, I must have gotten 40 new hardware messages and software crashes along the way and in the end I gave up, I put the PC back in the garage and put the zune for sale on amazon since my parents did not give me the receipt from the zune so I was not able to return it, I guess PC people don't think iTunes is all that great,  but they should try it on a mac the way it was made to work in the first place. Well for now I'll stay with my 3rd gen ipod till the wide screen ipod comes out, now that will be a zune killer if the zune even exists by that time at all.

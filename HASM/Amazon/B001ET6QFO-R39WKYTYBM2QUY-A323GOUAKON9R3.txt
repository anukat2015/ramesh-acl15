Title: Camera hangs up and gives you a busy message!
Content:
I bought this camera the end of January of this year. I used it a couple of times just to play with it. I then used it at a wedding on March 13th which was one day over my 30 day return limit. Needless to say the camera hangs up, gives you a busy message and will not let you take pictures! This happened during the wedding! I tried it again yesterday and it did the same thing. I contacted Amazon and all they say it tough, you are over your 30 days. So I'm stuck with a $900 camera that does not work half the time that I only have had barely over a month! And if I send it to Canon, I will have to pay to have it fixed! I have asked around and several people are complaining of the "busy" problem the camera has.

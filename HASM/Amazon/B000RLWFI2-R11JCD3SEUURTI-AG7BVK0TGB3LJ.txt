Title: All talk NO ACTION
Content:
THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY GOOD ABOUT THIS THING IS, THAT IT WAS DELIVERED ON TIME. I HAVE TRIED 4 DIFFERENT AVI CONVERTER PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE ONE THAT CAME WITH THE MP4 PLAYER. THE CONVERSION PROGRAMS SAY THAT THE FILE FORMAT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN CONVERTING TO AVI, BUT THAT IS AS FAR AS IT GOES. IT EITHER TELLS ME THAT THE FILE FORMAT IS NOT SUPPORTED OR, IT ACCEPTS IT, CONVERTS IT, TRANSFERS THE VIDEO TO THE PLAYER, AND THEN TELLS ME THAT THERE IS A FILE FORMAT ERROR. I AM REALLY TIRED OF TRYING TO PUT A SIMPLE VIDEO ON THE PLAYER FOR IT TO TELL ME THAT THERE IS A FILE FORMAT ERROR. THE MANUAL IS ABOUT AS VAGUE AS AN ASTROLOGERS HOROSCOPE. IT SERVES NO PURPOSE WHAT SO EVER, AND I WOULDN,T RECOMMEND THIS (THING) TO MY WORST ENEMY. I AM VERY COMPUTER LITERATE, SO ITS NOT THAT I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT THIS THING. BEWARE BUYERS. VERY UNHAPPY, AND UNSATISFIED SUCKER !!!

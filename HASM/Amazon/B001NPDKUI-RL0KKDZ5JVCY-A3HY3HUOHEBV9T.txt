Title: Crossing my fingers
Content:
I purchased this HP laptop late June '09. I used it for 5 weeks until one afternoon it completely crashed. After 5 hours with tech support and after rebooting the computer it died, dead as a doornail. It will NOT even power on. The computer is a paperweight for all I care. It's under warranty and will be going in for an autopsy. I guess I got another lemon...please be wary. On the bright side, HP tech support was courteous and efficient and were easy to understand (no accents ;) anyhoo other that that I like the computer...if it would only work.

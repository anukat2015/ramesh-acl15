Title: No More Cold Feet
Content:
I spend most of my evenings at the PC on my desk in the basement.  Needless to say, the floor is cold and a draft comes from the next room.  I just received the Vornado and I no longer go to bed with cold feet.  It is great as I don't want to heat the whole basement, it takes very little power, has simple control switches and makes a nice foot rest as well.  I would have given it 5 stars except that the the low heat setting doesn't seem to put out any heat and the fan is a little noisy on high.

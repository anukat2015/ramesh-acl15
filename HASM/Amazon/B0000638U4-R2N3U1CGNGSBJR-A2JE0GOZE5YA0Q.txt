Title: Product Misrepresented
Content:
As a very old customer of Amazon who values everything we ever bought on line, I have do be frank about the Delonghi PAC600T Pinguino Water-to-Air Portable Air Conditioner.  This unit looks much better than it is.However, the real problem is the gross misrepresentation about the performance and "convenience" of the unit.  Delonghi says that there are no water tanks to empty, but obscures the fact that a water tank must be filled once or twice a day to get even minimal results.  The unit "kicks out" at the slightest disturbance; its engineering requires the owner constantly to attend the unit for it to yield any cool, much less cold air.  "Semi-permanent" installation is offered, but the unit will never run effectively unless permanently installed.  This defeats its "portability".  In all respects, this product is a failure and its characterization on the web is both false and deceptive.

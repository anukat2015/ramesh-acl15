Title: Quality heater, but not for large areas.
Content:
I just got this heater, so I've not used it that much, but it seems to really only be effective in my bedroom if I close the door and leave it on for an hour on the highest setting because the room is small-ish.  My apartment's livingroom/kitchen's entire wall is single layer glass...and cold radiates in REALLY easily, so it's hard to keep warm.  I got this heater because my apartment only has really cruddy old electric wall heaters that cost a fortune to run.  I'm hoping this unit will be good enough to get me through my first Portland, Oregon winter...but...we'll see.  It does seem to be a really good quality product though, very well made.

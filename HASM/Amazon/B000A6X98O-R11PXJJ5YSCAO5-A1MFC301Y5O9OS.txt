Title: Bionaire Ceramic Heater
Content:
We bought 2 of these ceramic heaters; 1 is perfect and works well, the other 1 has made noise since we got it (although it does heat well) and when we called Bionaire to try to get it repaired or replaced, we were told we couldn't do so.  We don't think we'd buy these heaters again for that reason, although they do work pretty well.  We don't feel the customer service and followup is good on  these products.

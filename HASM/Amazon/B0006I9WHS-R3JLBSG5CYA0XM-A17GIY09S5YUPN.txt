Title: A Gamble - Maybe Great, Maybe Junk
Content:
The first one of these that I bought was absolutely wonderful... Just like the great reviews listed. When it stopped working (after about 2 winters), of course I bought another just like it. Second one I bought put out more heat, but stopped working after about 2 minutes and wouldn't come back on except after unplugging and cooling. I thought it was a fluke, so I bought two more (great price, small, safe and cute). One sort of works, but barely puts out any heat. The other one is like the second... Works for a few minutes and then shuts off. The three that I have now just don't do it for me (sadly). I'm going to purchase another space heater for this winter, but not this Model. :-(  My summary:
Appearance: 5 star
Compactness: 5 star
Safety Rate: 4 star (Front can get a little hot, but pretty safe)
Economical: 5 star  (Low price to buy & low cost to operate)
Reliablity: 1 star  (They lost me here. I am so sad. Wish they all worked 
                    like the first one I bought...sigh.)

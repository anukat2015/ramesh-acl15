Title: GREAT DEAL IF YOU"RE LUCKY OR PATIENT
Content:
The bottom line is I had to ship two defective units back to the manufacturer before I insisted their technician test the unit, before sending another replacement. The unit DOES have a pump which is supposed to bring water from a bottom trough to drip down through a swamp cooler "radiator", evaporate, and provide cool air as a fan blows into it. On the first two units the pump didn't work. The third seems to be working well, although I've missed the hottest part of the summer - I'm keeping my fingers crossed. You MAY be lucky and get a good unit the first time; [...], which is very professional and understanding - they'll pay for the shipping - but I suggest you do what I did and insist they test it first. It works very well when it works, but it is NOT a refrigerated air unit - it depends on lack of humidity and evaporation, so if your humidity is over 40% this won't work for you. Caveat Emptor, and good luck.

Title: Nice coffee maker
Content:
I purchased this product to replace a coffee maker that I had bought about two weeks earlier that worked poorly. The price was a little higher than I had intended to pay but based on the reviews I purchased the coffee maker. I am pleased with the design and function. The carafe pours well (no spillage issues) and the coffee is hot and remains so after brewing. There is a  temprature control so you can set how warm/hot you want the coffee. There is a programmable 'auto off' feature so you set the time you want the coffee maker to shut off.

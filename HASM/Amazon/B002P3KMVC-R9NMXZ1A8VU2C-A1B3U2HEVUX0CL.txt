Title: Fast, lightweight, and excellent sound
Content:
This is a good all-around laptop.  I used to hate watching movies or shows on my computer, but with the excellent graphics and sound, this is no longer true.  You'll have to download your content, or at least watch online- no DVD (which is why it's so lightweight). I wish it had bluetooth- you will have to give up one of your USB ports (you have three) for a transmitter.  The touchpad is responsive enough that I'm often misplacing my mouse.  As for the battery- 12 hours is no exaggeration.  You may be misplacing your power chord as well.

Title: Great Camera, not for everyone (Autofocus little unpredictable)
Content:
After a few weeks of using I have taken great shots, but I have had to select central focus point or others focus points manually.  The nine focus points by default tend to select the near subject, and not is usually the subject that I wanted.  In SLR cameras the "deep of field" is more notorious, than point and shoot cameras.  Now I understand, why some people sees focus issues with this camera. Once you Understand the capabilities (and some limitations), You have a great photographic tool.
Another Thing, the first day I tried my old 420EX flash, It didn't work.  I tried Canon support for product compatibility questions and they respond very quickly.  Later I clean the contacts and the problems were solves.  I have tried this camera with my old EF 50mm 1.8II lens and EF 75-300 3.5-5.6 Ultrasonic with great results. (Sorry for my English)

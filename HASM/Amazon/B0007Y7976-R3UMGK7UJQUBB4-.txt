Title: I love my 2GB White iPod Nano!!!!!!!
Content:
This is the review I have been LONGING to make- one for a gorgous, beautiful white iPod nano! I got it for Christmas from my parents. I love my nano, I call it my ba"nana". (Nano, Nana) Its sitting next to me right now... I love it. 
Unlike the iPod mini that my cousin got for Christmas, my iPod nano came charged and ready for action! When I opened the package, I took out my nano and quickly figured out how to turn it on and off! (But, playing with friends assortment of ipods, minis, nanos, videos, photos, and normal, didn't hurt a bit) This iPod is easy to learn how to use- EVEN IF you don't have prior experience!
My Computer if so old so I can't download songs from it. My mom is bringing her laptop home so I can download all my songs!So, all yesterdy, I played games on my iPod nano.
If you are thinking of getting a nano, GET ONE! but, get a 2GB White iPod Nano! 
iPod addict,

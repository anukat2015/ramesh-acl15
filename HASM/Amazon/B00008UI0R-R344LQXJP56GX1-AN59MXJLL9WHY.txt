Title: Nice If You Like Canister and Bagless Style Vacuums.
Content:
This is a very nice vacuum but I am not use to having a canister style vacuum.  I dread having to bring it up and down the stairs.  When I have to vacuum it seems like I am pulling around 2 vacuums because of the canister and the main head/hose.  I would like to just get the vacuum out and vacuum but I feel like it is more of a chore now. 
I told myself I would never buy a bagless vacuum because of all the dust that floats around when you empty it into the trash and I should have listened to myself because it is a pain and gross.(Sneeze)  Why do bagless vacuums have HEPA filters if you are going to dump it out anyway and get the dust in the air??? I thought I would be saving money with not buying bags but eventually you need to buy a new filter and they cost around $20.
If you like bagless and canister style vacuums then this is a very nice machine.  Very powerful suction and beater brush.  The brush is so powerful that it pulls your arm forward and your arm muscles get sore when you bring the head back to you.  I lift weights so I don't mind the pull but it sure gives you a work out moving it forward and back.  I would think a smaller person would find it exhausting.  Switching hands would give you a nice even workout!!! :)
The attachments are nice.  I especially like the smaller airmotor brush attachment for carpeted stairs and furnature.  Very powerful!

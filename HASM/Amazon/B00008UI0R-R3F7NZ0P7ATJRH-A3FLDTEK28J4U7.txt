Title: Small but Powerful
Content:
First I was pleased it shipped so fast, I order on 1/25/07 and it shipped 1/26/07 and I received it on 1/31/07 in perfect condition. This vacuum is great..it has 3 power suction control and off control right on the wand, no stepping on the cansister to turn on or off..and is suprizing quiet for the power it has.  The wash and replace Hepa filter is great..no filters to buy or bags..the dust recepital is easy to empty and does not leak..Best to empty it outside..but that is not a problem.

Title: We couldn't be more pleased
Content:
We bought this coffee maker to replace a highly (over)rated Krups. Since it's just my husband and myself at home now to drink coffee, my husband wondered why we needed a 14 cup model?  Let me tell you, the coffee is great. We were able to adjust the strength just where we want and those 14 cups are gone in no time. We think the coffee maker is much better designed than our last 2 coffee makers that were about $100 each and have long since crapped out. I am hoping this will last us for a long while. It has a beeper that lets you know when the coffee is done. There is even a feature that lets you know when to clean the coffee maker. I hope I don't have to change my rating in the future but so far, we give it 5 stars.

Title: Our First Lap Top
Content:
we wanted a lap top for our vacation to florida. We found this one at Staples for $499.00. We have only had it for a month and so far we love it. We have only two issues with this lap top. #1 when you set up a guest on the computer you can not give the guest a name. #2 the mouse pad is super sensitive, I called tech support 5 days ago and they have not called me back. This does not say much for toshiba tech support. The first person I talked to could not figure out how to change the sensitivity. I would buy this product again.

Title: Perfect in everything
Content:
i had a d40x and i bought the D300,while i really liked my previous camera, but the D300 is a really different ones,a camera that you would depend on for a longer time.im not saying the D40x isnt that good,but after time u will feel u would need something with more capabilities, and here where the D300 fits, what a camera...best in everything,ergonomics,quality of pics,options available for adjustments.higher ISO, u even feel u wouldnt be in need to lower aperture lenses, the only bad thing about it for me is the weight,i know i would get used to it, but that was my first impression compared to the D40x weight, which is almost half weight,another bad thing that it went down $ 50 after i just bought it:))

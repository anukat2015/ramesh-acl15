Title: Needs better suction
Content:
It took me weeks of research to order this vacuum and I did it based on reviews. Sadly, in my opinion, it really should have better suction and I've got it at max suction on the appropriate floor/carpet setting. Also, it's a bit heavy and cumbersome. Unfortunately there weren't any stores anywhere in my area that carried these in house for me to demo before I bought. I would not buy it if I had the chance to do it over.

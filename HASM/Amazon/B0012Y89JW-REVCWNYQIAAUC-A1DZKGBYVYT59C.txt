Title: Very happy
Content:
I'm very happy with my recent purchase of the Canon Digital Rebel XSi.  I had a 35mm Canon Rebel EOS before switching to digital and I'm very glad that they're so similar so I didn't have to learn a lot of new settings.  
One of my favorite settings for this particular camera that I didn't have before was the macro setting.  I can get as close as 3 inches to something and take a clear photograph of it.  It makes photographing the garden a lot more fun.
The precision focusing and quick flickerflash are bonus items as well.  It's so fast and accurate and so far, I've taken well over 2,000 shots and haven't had red eye in any one of them.  Most of the time I don't even need a flash since the automatic setting will adjust the light as I need it, including an extended aperture which will give more light in a low light situation as long as I hold the camera very still (or use a tripod).  
As a portrait photographer, I love this camera as well.  Without the flash, I can take a very clear photograph of someone and have their skin tone glow and their eyes clear and focused.  With the flash, it doesn't bleach them out and as I already mentioned, red eye has so far not been a concern.
I absolutely recommend this camera to anyone wanting to improve their shots.  I first used it when it belonged to a friend and loved it.  When I was ready to go digital, I asked for the make and model and here I am now, ranting and raving about my new "baby".  I'm rarely found without it these days.  I love it!

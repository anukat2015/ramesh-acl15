Title: great product as almost always in case of Apple
Content:
We more or less knew what to expect so I don't have much to say. I bought it as a gift for my wife so that she be able to film our 22 month-old son whenever she pleases without having to use a bulky camcorder. I'm not sure of the battery life as I don't personally use the device. But since I don't see her use it OFTEN and I do see th eipod sometimes being charged and I know she has used it for filming only so far (we haven't copied any music on it yet), I make an assumption the battery life leaves to desire.

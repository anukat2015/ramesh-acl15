Title: OK for Tea
Content:
We bought this to brew tea to make iced tea. We know it's not intended for that purpose, but previous experience with making tea using a coffee maker with good results led us to repeat the process. The Bunn requires running the water through the brewing process twice or else the tea is too weak.

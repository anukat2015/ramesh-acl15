Title: So far it is great!
Content:
I have only had this coffee pot for about a month, but so far I love it.  I decided to get one after my mom has had her's for 5 years and it is still working at top performance.  It keeps the coffee hot the entire time it is on without havig to be turned to the highest temp setting.  I also like the charcoal filter.  I can actually taste the difference in my coffee.  The add bonus I got it for the same price as my old one and it was not as good of quality.

Title: Close to perfect for us...
Content:
I read all the reviews of this coffee maker before we bought one.
We must have a new and improved model. There is a water-line tube on the outside, left side of the machine...very easy to read and is accurate. 
There is NO hotplate (don't know where that review came from), the filter holder can only go in one way for no mistakes, the screw-on lid to the EXCELLENT carafe is wide-threaded so no way can you get it on NOT straight (unless you don't look)...
Everything works great...and the coffee stays 'hot' at least 10 hours because that's how long it took me to drink it all. It makes great coffee (and uses less coffee with more taste) and we would buy it again in a heartbeat!

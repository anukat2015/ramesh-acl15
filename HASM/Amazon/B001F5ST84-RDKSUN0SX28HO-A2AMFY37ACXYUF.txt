Title: Works great
Content:
Extremely quiet and heats objects/people well by radiant heat.  Used in a large, open great room where heating the room's air is impractical.  Replaced a small fan/ceramic heater which we would huddle around. This heater keeps us warm while sitting on couches a few feet away. Very happy with this purchase.

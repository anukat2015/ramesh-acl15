Title: Cools However, it Leaks Rivers of water on the Floor...
Content:
The unit does cool wonderfully, However it has leaked rivers of water onto my carpet.  I have left 3 messages with the manufacturer and have gotten NO response from them.  I see no possible easy way to drain the water since the port is one inch off the floor.  I have resorted to putting the unit on a dog kennel tray to prevent the saturation of the surrounding carpet.  I would consider selling the item to get rid of it, However, I cannot even begin to imagine the bad feedback I would get from selling this item. Next step is to try returning to original place of purchase since in my opinion the item is defective--it recycles little or no water. Only dumping water on the floor.  Good Luck buying this, Buyer Beware!

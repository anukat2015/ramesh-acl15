Title: Better then I expected.
Content:
For about 3 weeks, I had been reading the forums about the ASUS UL30A & UL20A & the wireless network problems that many people complained about.It seemed so wide spread that I was afraid to buy one & just kept putting it off & continued using my ASUS EEE PC1005HA P. Finally, I decided to give it a shot. I only wished I had ordered one sooner. In my house, my 1005, had "good" reception when I was 40' away & when I was at the college I work at, the reception was "very weak". The area I'm in at school is brick walls & metel roofing & I'm about 70' away from the nearest signal. Now with the UL20A. At home, my signal is "excellent" & at the school, it's "very good". Therefore, I can honestly say that I have no wireless problem what so ever. HOWEVER, the left side of the keyboard is a bit loose & makes a bit of noise when typing. I can live with it but it would be nice if it was as quiet as the right side. If you're considering buying one of these units but are worried about the wireless problem, I would suggest you take the plunge & check it out for yourself. I love mine.

Title: Buy it, get it over with
Content:
Y'know, I always long to believe that if I pay more for a product, I will actually GET a better product.  That I'll have an experience that satisfies -- or, heaven forbid, exceeds -- the expectations raised by the price. 
That path so often leads to disappointment.  
But not with this puppy.  I bought my Miele a year ago now, and I am blissfully happy with it.  
How many vacuums have you thrown away?  They broke, they stopped sucking, they were so loud your head hurt using them, they didn't filter, the bags were lousy and messy, etc, etc.
It doesn't have to be like that.  There is a better vacuum.  You're looking at it.
Read the reviews here.  Believe them.  Look, I just spent five minutes writing about a vacuum cleaner.  That takes some special effort from those folks at Miele, let me tell ya.

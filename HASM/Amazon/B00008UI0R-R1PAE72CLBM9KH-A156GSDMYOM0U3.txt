Title: I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner at all!
Content:
We had this vacuum cleaner purchased to use in cleaning our church.  I had high hopes but was soon disappointed with how it did not hold together.  The BIGGEST problem was the wheels on the rug head.  They fell off constantly forcing us to use duct tape and other measures just to keep it functioning. The hose connection is also weak and it would either overheat and quit or lose the connection, we are not sure which. We finally had to buy another vacuum cleaner after just two years, but for the money, this should last for years.  Move on with your search, in the long run this vacuum cleaner has too many faults and I want to save you that frustration.

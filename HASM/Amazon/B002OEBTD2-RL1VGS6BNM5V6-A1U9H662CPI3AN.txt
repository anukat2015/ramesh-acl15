Title: its awesome
Content:
levels of details, image quality, noise, features - I love everything about this little gem. Video is good too and my only complaint is that it needed a lithium-ion rechargeable battery to support more battery life when using movie\live mode. Its enough when using 4 AA lithium batteries - it lasts for at least a 1000s shots plus some occasional live mode and movie usage. Ive read about Sanyo eneloop rechargeables (these should last longer) but havent tried them yet. But with regular rechargeables it doesnt last that long enough. 
I love the low noise and amount of details I can get shooting up to 1600 ISO - night shots (no flash), aquarium or theater images now look beautiful and I dont have to use a flash. All shot with 1600 ISO gives me enough shutter speed to get great sharp and detailed images.
UPDATE: 12/15/2009
Pentax released a firmware update for k-x dSLR that fixes battery problem.

I have installed the firmware and it looks like it does fixes the problem. Now it doesnt give me half-battery orange indicator when I use my lithiums (its still green). 
I havent tried it with rechargeables because I dont have any yet (still using my lithiums).
UPDATE: 04/01/2010
I bought Sanyo Eneloop Rechargeable Batteries - those working out pretty well in holding the charge. 
Since December I think I only recharged them two or three times and the indicator got into red just yesterday.

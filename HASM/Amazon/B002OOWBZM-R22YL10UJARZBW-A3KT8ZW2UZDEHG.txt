Title: Great but you should know...
Content:
I absolutely love this little computer. It is a lot lighter than i was expecting and its got a great battery. there were a few things i think everyone should know before they buy though. First and foremost there is no CD drive, no way to load or to burn. They failed to mention this in the ad and i didn't even think to ask because I assumed that was standard for all laptops. Wrong. Second the speakers don't get very loud. they are great if you're alone and sitting near it but don't try to project sound cause it's not going to go any where. and finally while its not a huge problem it is an annoying one, finger prints show up like crazy. After typing this message my keys now look grey-ish rather than black. It's not a deal breaker but I would recommend the white or red versions rather than the black. Hope that helps.

Title: Good suction, but clip that holds handle upright broke after a couple of months
Content:
The suction on the vac is great, but the quality is not up to the usual Electrolux quality that I've come to expect over the years.  Something snapped after a couple of months of use and the handle will no longer stand upright.  This is a real inconvenience; and I'm sure way too expensive to have to ship it back for repair.

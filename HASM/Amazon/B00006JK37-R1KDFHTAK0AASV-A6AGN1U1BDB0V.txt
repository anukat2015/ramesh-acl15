Title: Fantastic Camera
Content:
I read many reviews before finally deciding to spend this much money for a camera - and I am so glad I did.  Proof is in the pictures processed and they are beautiful.  All of the important buttons are on the outside and easily reachable.  Autofocus is fast and accurate.  Battery life is long and camera is easy to use and learn.Lag time with pictures was always a problem with the other cameras I had used, but with this camera that is a thing of the past.  I really haven't found anything bad complain about with this camera.  A great buy.

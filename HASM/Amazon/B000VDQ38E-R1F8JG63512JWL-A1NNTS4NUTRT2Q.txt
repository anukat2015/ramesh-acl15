Title: Terrible Vacuum!
Content:
We only have 1 dog and yet within just a month of owning this vacuum the dog hair had clogged it.  Then a piece on the bottom broke off.  They sent us a new part and it broke off again.  Now the belt keeps breaking on it and next thing I know there's smoke coming out of it.  It is absolutely terrible and we've only had it a few months.  We got it for about $120 at Walmart and all I can say is that obviously if you buy a cheap vacuum you'll get cheap results.

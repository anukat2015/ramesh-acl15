Title: A real SLR that handles like an SLR, not a computer game
Content:
At this point, any of the top cameras will take great photos and this is no exception.  The sensor on this camera ranks 5th overall in the &lt;$3000 (body only) range (google DXOMark)  This camera is set apart by the feel and features.  It feels and handles like a camera, like a photographer's SLR designed to be efficient at taking pictures, not amusing the owner.  Everything falls to hand easily.  The function two which one needs easy access, are easily accessible: white balance, exposure compensation, ISO, others, all have dedicated buttons.  Focus is very, very fast.  It has a near infra red focus assist lamp so it doesn't blind your subject and make them stiff the way that bright white anoyoflex lights do - this alone makes it worth a nod to me.  The screen is fabulous, very hi rez and very bright.  Zooming in to check the expression of each person in a group shot or the sharpness of a photo is as easy as can be.  Everything just works.  The lens is good, not excellent - pretty sharp at the center, kind of soft at the edges at the short end, decent at the long end.  Very good contrast and color rendition.  The camera is definitely the size, weight (and construction) of a semi pro body, so if you want a compact, this might not be for you.  However, it does handle nicely with a well shaped grip.

Title: Cuisinart is a champ!
Content:
This coffeemaker is excellent. I have used it for several months and it has performed flawlessly. It brews up 56 oz. of wonderful hot coffee at 170 degrees. After three hours, the temp dropped only 5 degrees to 165. After ten hours it was still a drinkable 145 degrees. The cone shaped filter basket seems to brew more concentrated coffee than the flat basket Black & Decker Thermal coffeemaker I used before.
Two small issues: 1) The lid is a bit tricky to screw on squarely, and 2)the pour is a bit slow. This is probably a function of the excellent thermal properties of the lid and worth the wait. I have not experienced any of the overflow issues that others complained about - even when the lid is misthreaded.
Overall a terrific coffeemaker that is dependable and delivers great coffee.

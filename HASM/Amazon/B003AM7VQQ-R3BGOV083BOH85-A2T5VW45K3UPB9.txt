Title: ASUS customer service sucks
Content:
I bought an ASUS laptop and 2 weeks later the "Z" key falls off.  Contacted customer service who stated I would have to send the computer in or replace the whole keyboard.  To send it in I would need to get a box and pack it, they won't send you one.  If I want them to send me a replacement keyboard I have to fax them my credit card information, which they will charge if I don't send back the broken one.  They will not just send you a replacement key.  I couldn't understand the first person I talked to on the phone, but I definitely got the idea she had a bad attitude.  She never followed through with sending me the mailing label she was suppose to, so I could mail it in.  Another interesting fact is when I sent in my warranty card, it cams back as undeliverable, giving me the impression this company is not very reliable.  This is definitely a customer no-service company.  I have just learned to live without my "Z" key, since I hate to think of all that can go wrong if I sent my computer in to these clowns.

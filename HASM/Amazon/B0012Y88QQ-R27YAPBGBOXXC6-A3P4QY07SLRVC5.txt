Title: number one ranked canon dslr on flickr!
Content:
pro: faster shutter speed than my high end point and shoot and thats a given although my lx2 cost more than this with lens and kit lol. LONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG battery life. i've taken over 1000 photos and it only consumed half the battery. takes sdhc cards instead of compact flash. non of my computers have those compactflash slots.
con: red pixel hot spots? i supposed this is a gamble but i'm getting it exchanged. doesnt do well in dark area shutter speed becomes much slower when taking those without flash on.
it is not a machine gun but 3 photos per second aint bad for the price. i was originally looking at the 7d but ended up buying this instead so i can get some good lens with it.

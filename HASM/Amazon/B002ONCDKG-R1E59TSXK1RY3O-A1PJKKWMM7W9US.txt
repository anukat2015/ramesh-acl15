Title: My laptop
Content:
Hey every1 i ordered this on the 10th of dec 09.
Am in the caribbean ,when i  got it i was so happy casue i needed a laptop for school and work. I've had my destop for 8yrs n needed a change.
Its has been woorkin fine for the last 3mths UNTIL last thursday when my harddrive died.
I wouldnt advise anyone to buy this laptop. Befor i bought it i heard of everyone sayin how the drives are the 1st to go.Please keep ur money n if u can buy a Apple if u cant beacuse of the price but a sony or a dell.
I should have kept my money n bought something else.

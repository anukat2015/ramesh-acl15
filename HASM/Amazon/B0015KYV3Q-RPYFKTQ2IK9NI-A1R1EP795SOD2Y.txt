Title: Big disapointment!
Content:
I purchased an 8 GB Sansa Fuze from another store (for $20 more than Amazon's price) and the battery would never charge after three attempts on three different computers. Also, none of the computers would recognize that the drive was plugged in. It's definitely going back and I'm not sure if I'm willing to try another one.

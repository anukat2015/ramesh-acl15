Title: I love my Nano
Content:
I actually bought a touch too and took it back.  I like the simplicity of the nano and the ability to watch movies.  If I need a toy, there are better gaming systems out there and my blackberry gives me what I need for mobile internet and tools.  I think the 4th gen Nano is well designed, I just wish I would have ordered the 16gb.

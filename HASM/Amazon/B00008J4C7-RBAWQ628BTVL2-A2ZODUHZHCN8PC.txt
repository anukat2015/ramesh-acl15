Title: Great Vac!
Content:
It's the second Shark I've purchased. This time for my mom. I love it! For its price the vac works awesome! Only two small problems- a. Court it short (I use extension court so this doesn't bother me a single bit) b. I have to clean filter couple of times while cleaning the whole house (We have German Shepherd and the amount of hair he sheds is huge!).
On the other hand the positive features: a. It cleans hardwood floors perfectly! (And I had $800 vac before which was not doing nearly as good as this one on the hardwoods) b. It's very light weight (Really-really light!!!) c. If you remember to clean it regularly, it's super powerful! d. It works well on hardwood as well as on the carpet. So, overall- for its price- it's the best buy!

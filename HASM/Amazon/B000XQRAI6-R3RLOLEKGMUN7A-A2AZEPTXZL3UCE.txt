Title: Excellent Entry MP3 Player
Content:
Bought this for my 11 yr old son who wanted an iPod, but I was not going to spend that kind of money.  After much research I settled on this one and I'm glad I did, it's a great little player.  Has decent sound quality from the included speakers (however, others can hear your music), easy operation, easy to read screen and love the attached clip.  My son loves this thing.  It's just the right size for him and has the features/functions that he needs.

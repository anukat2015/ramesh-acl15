Title: Excellent Digital SLR, Easy to use
Content:
I have now had this camera for two weeks.  This is my first Digital SLR.  It was recommended to me by a Professional Photographer for my local Pro Football and Baseball team.  I was originally going to get a 450D (XSi), however he talked me into getting the 40D.  I am very impressed with this camera.  I previously had point and shoot digital camera and a very old 35MM Film SLR.  I was taking very good pictures within an hour of receiving. It took that long to charge the battery for the first time, so I read the manual. Please read the manual and search youtube for some tutorials.  Controls are very well organized.  The menu is very straight forward compared to my Digital Elph and Powershot S3.  The 28 to 135 lens that came with my camera is a very good starter lens and I will probably use this for quite a while before investing in an upgraded lens.  My only complaints so far is this camera is much larger and heavier than a Digital rebel. While this helps me since I have large hands, my wife doesn't like it at all.  I may invest in the grip/battery upgrade which while increasing weight will give it a better handle.  The built in flash is one of the best built-ins I've ever used. I have no plans to get an external flash anytime soon because of this.  This camera seems to be very well thought out, if that makes sense to you.  I believe the controls will soon become second nature to me like my old 35 and I will just concentrate on composing the shot.  I highly recommend this camera.

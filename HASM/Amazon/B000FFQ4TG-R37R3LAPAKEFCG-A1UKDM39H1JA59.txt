Title: Replaced an older Bunn coffee maker and like this one as well!
Content:
This is the second Bunn coffee maker that I've owned.  The first one lasted approximately 10 years and I'm hopeful that this one will also last for a long time.  I've been very pleased with it so far!  Bunn was offering a rebate at the time I placed my order through Amazon, so that made it even more affordable, too.

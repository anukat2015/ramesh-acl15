Title: Not convenient for real coffee drinkers
Content:
Solid product that makes a cup of coffee in 4 minutes. Great variety of pre-packaged coffees with option to brew your own brands.
BUT: 
   Quantity -- You have 3 choices for cup size. The smallest is gone in a few sips. The medium tastes best but is still gone too fast. The large only fills a travel mug a little over half way.
   Quality -- Many say this unit makes weak, watery coffee. That is especially true when you go for the "large" mug.
   Logistics -- my wife and I both drink coffee in the morning, but leave for work nearly simultaneously. You can set one cup to brew while you shower but the second person has to wait 4 minutes -- an eternity when you are ready to walk out the door.
   Cleanup -- Going out of town for a couple of weeks? Need to drain the coffee maker? Good luck figuring out how. The manual tells you how to "purge" the water in the unit buy putting in fresh water, but not how to get all water out if you want to mothball it for a bit. When I sent my unit back to Amazon it still had some water in the interior tank.
   Size -- Seriously, this thing takes up a LOT of counter space for something that only makes a few ounces of coffee at a time.
Bottom line: If you want a few ounces of coffee at a time (great for those working in the home), then this might work for you. If you need to brew quickly different coffees to satisfy different tastes (great for entertaining), then this is good. But as someone who drinks large mugs of coffee, not namby-pamby teacups, and as someone who brews and then takes it on the road, I actually prefer my 4 cup brewer from Wal-mart where I can control both quantity and strength.

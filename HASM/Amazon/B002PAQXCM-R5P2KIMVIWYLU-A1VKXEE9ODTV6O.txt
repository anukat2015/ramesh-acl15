Title: good performance, but poor keyboard&touchpad
Content:
Good performance and nice graphics/sound support. However, very poor keyboard and touch pad. Pressing some of the keys on the left side of the keyboard is making a disturbing sound. Also, touch-pad buttons are very hard and make a disturbing click sound.

Title: Great camera for the Beginer
Content:
I bought the camera a month back..And the picture it took were awesome..I was in a dillema whether to buy Canon Rebel XTI or Nikon D40.. was doing a lots of reaserch..And went to the Circuit city store..and the touch of feel of Nikon D40 was awesome..I just liked the camera instantly..But Canon Rebel is a great camera also..But didn't like it in my hand..Somehow felt like cheap plastic to my hand..and the default 18-55 MM lens that canon provide with the camera is just useless..so went for Nikon D40 and never felt sorry for it.. Here are couple of things that would like to mention about the camera..
Pros 
1. Picture quality is just awesome..
2. Auto focus is fast..very good for novice users like me..
3. On board help facillity..
4. Cann't beat the build,look and feel..
5. Price..well too less for a gem like this..
6. Kit lens..too good..Nikon quality offcourse..
7. Lots of advanced feature if you wanna explore..Very good while u transition from a novice user to so called proffesional
Cons
1. It doesn't have in built auto focus motor..So won't be able to auto focus with all lens..So check for compatibillity while you shop around for lens..Nikon AF-S series are the ones compatible with this camera..other lens you will be able to manual focus..But who cares..I might not use more than my kit lens and the 50-200 AF-S lens..
2. 3 point auto focus..This is something I didn't like..Most of the people use center focus..But I prefer more AF points..like a 9 point AF in Canon XTI or 11 point in other nikon cameras..You can choose the areas you wanna focus...But as I said most people are fine with center AF..but who cares if you gonna use only with Auto mode..
3. Burst mode..is something you would like to use during sports photography..and this is something I felt like handicaped in this camera.. I liked it better in Canon XTI..

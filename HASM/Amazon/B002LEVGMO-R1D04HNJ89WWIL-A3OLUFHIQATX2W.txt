Title: Great value
Content:
I use a lot of different computers. My main work machine is a macbook pro 15". My gaming machine is a core2quad q6600 w/ ATI 9870.  I had a acer aspire one 8.9" atom based machine for travel that I sold when I bought this (which is a great machine in its own right). I also had an Inspiron 11z that I thought was great until I saw this machine's specs for the same price.  I returned the 11z and bought this.
This machine is simply an amazing value for the money.  The Dell is indeed good, but this one outclasses it in every way.  All of the compromises of the 11z are gone.  Battery 6 cell vs. 3 cell.  Processor 1.4ghz solo vs. Celeron 1.2ghz.  N wireless vs. G.  I think it is amazing that Acer/Amazon can sell this machine and make any money. 
Performance is great for general purpose computing and it can even play games (casual mostly).  I hooked this up to my 1080p hdtv and the video and audio output is really nice.  Overall, I'm very happy.  Don't expect a desktop here.. that it is not, but it is a great travel companion and overall I am really impressed.
Review Update 12/16/09 - I just wanted to update my review after a few months of use.  The more I use this machine, the more I like it.  Battery life has been solid - about 4.5 hours on average with reasonable use (I would probably opt for the slightly improved 1810 at this point for a little more money just for the extra battery life and dual core cpu).  The form factor is perfect for me and the keyboard and trackpad are very comfortable.  Wake up from sleep and hibernation is fast as well.  The windows 7 upgrade was smooth and everything works really well.  Still a 5 star machine for me.

Title: DeLonghi Oil-Filled Heater
Content:
Bought the Delonghi oil filled radiator heater for my Mother-in-Law's bedroom.  Have only had it about a month, but love it so far.  It heats the room much more quickly than I anticipated, keeps the room toasty on the lower power settings.  Have the timer set to go on/off at selected times and it works great.  We live in the San Diego area, so don't have overly cold weather, but so far love this unit and would highly recommend it for others.

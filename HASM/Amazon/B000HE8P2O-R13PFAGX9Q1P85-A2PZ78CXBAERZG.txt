Title: DO NOT BUY TO CONNECT TO BIG BUDDY FUEL HOSE !!!!!

DO NOT BUY TO CONNECT TO BIG BUDDY FUEL HOSE !!!!!
The Mr. Heater Fuel Filter for Portable Buddy and Big Buddy Heaters.
It's Impossible to tell if this product does as advertised. It was ordered and recieved in a reasonable time period along with The Big Buddy Heater and Big Buddy Fuel Hose to attach to a Propane Tank (Where It Might Be Needed). It was packaged decently. The problem was that The Fuel Filter CANNOT Connect to The Big Buddy Fuel Hose, There Is NO Way To Make It Fit. The Problem Is That The Fuel Filter Has A THREADED Connection And The Fuel Hose Has A QUICK FIT Connection. I Would Return It If Not For The Fact That It Would Be More Of A Hassle Than It's Worth. I WILL BE WRITING TO MR. BIG BUDDY. AS IF CORPORATE AMERICA IS NOT RIPPING OFF THE WORKING PEOPLE ENOUGH. *** I Would Have Given ZERO Stars IF Possible***

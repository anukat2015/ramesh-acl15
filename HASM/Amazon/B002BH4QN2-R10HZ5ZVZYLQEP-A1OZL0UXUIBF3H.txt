Title: I did not find it as I expected
Content:
i bought this computer two weeks ago and returned back after one week. this is not a protable computer. it has pillow on the back side which is obviously 12 cell battery. that battery weights as same as the laptop.I could not find this battery lasts such long like i saw on other reviews. Now there are lots of laptops in the market with 6 cell battery and runs more hrs than this heavy pillow. it was my bad luck that i could find those featured computers in the market before ordering this. I found later on. and you can feel that battery does not fit properly, it is loose. you can shake it with simple contact. other thing is its touch pad which is sticky. I did not like it at all. I was still making my mind to deal with all these and tried not to return BUT next day i could not boot this computer unless you select the safe mode. it asked password, and says configuring, and says dumping physical memory, and gives the options to select, open normally, or open on safemode. it did not open normally but in safe mode. and that was it. I could not afford to waste my hard earned money on such crap. so without getting any delay, i just packed it and sent.

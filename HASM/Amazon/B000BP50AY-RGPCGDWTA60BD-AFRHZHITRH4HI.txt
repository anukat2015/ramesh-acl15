Title: An inexpensive and capable sports MP3 player
Content:
Although not typically marketed as a sports player, the SanDisk Sansa M240 fills that niche quite well and is inexpensive enough to replace in case accidentally damaged during an aggressive workout. 
The player is very small, light, easy to operate, and includes a plastic cover and arm band (neither of which is bullet-proof but function well). The cover is not water proof but will prevent perspiration from seaping into the player. I suggest leaving the cover on at all times- it's a tight fit and removing and replacing it regularly risks tearing it. 
I'd also suggest splurging on a good set of sports headphones rather than relying on the included buds.

Title: Its all about the jasmine tea!
Content:
I worked at a couple of places that have the high capacity flavia machines and I noticed that the jasmine green tea was far and away the most popular thing these machines make. The flavia guy would show up twice a week with more packets and with in an hour of the refill the jasmine tea would be gone because folks hoarded them.  So even if you aren't normally a green tea drinker you ought to check it out.  
The coffees are a mixed bag: I find that I like the colombian but that the dark roasts (italian, espresso) are not really that tasty from this machine (and normally I do like dark roasts.)
Anyway this machine is dern convenient and I am pretty sure that you can find something that it makes you will find tasty.

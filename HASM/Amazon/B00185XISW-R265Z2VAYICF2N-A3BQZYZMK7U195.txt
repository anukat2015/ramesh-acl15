Title: Eco-Heater
Content:
I bought the eco-heater because my daughter's room is always the coldest in the house during the winter.  It's on the North West corner of the house and is the furthest room from the furnace.  I've always been a little leery of space heaters in kid's rooms and have been looking for a good alternative.  I ran across the eco-heater and decided to give it a try.  Other then the mounting hardware could be better quality (broke out a wall anchor right away) it's been great.  While I don't think that it would work as a sole heat source it does a great job of taking the chill out of the air at night.  I am still waiting for the thermostat to get here so I just put the unit on a timer.  When I go in to my daughter's room at night it's now the warmest in the house.  It does take up a lot of wall space but it is relatively out of the way.  The surface does get hot but not so hot that you would instantly burn yourself.  You wouldn't want to keep your hands on it either.  I would say it's like holding a hot cup of coffee.  I think this is a great little heater and I would not hesitate to buy another.

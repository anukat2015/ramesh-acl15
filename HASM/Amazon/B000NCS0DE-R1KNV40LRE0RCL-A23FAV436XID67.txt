Title: Uncontrollable
Content:
It has a powerful motor with high suction. Unfortunately the position of such a motor in a light, handheld device creates a tremendous gyroscopic effect. The thing always wants to move in a different direction than you want it to. It's like the thing is alive and fighting you. Extraordinarily irritating and inconvenient. Definitely NOT recommended. I am sending mine back.

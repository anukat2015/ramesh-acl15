Title: great coffee maker
Content:
This is my third Bunn.  You get spoiled after the first one.  This is the first one I've had with the insulated carafe.  I love it.  This machine makes a full pot in three minutes.  The carafe keeps it hot for several hours and you never have to worry about turning off a hot plate.  The coffee also stays fresh.  I'll probably always own one of these.

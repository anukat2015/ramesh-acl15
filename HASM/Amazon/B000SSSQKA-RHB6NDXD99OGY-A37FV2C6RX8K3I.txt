Title: Just Perfect!
Content:
After replacing carpeting with wood flooring, I was on the lookout for a good, light weight canister.  My upright did not work on the wood floors and the hose attachment created back-breaking work.  Sweeping & swiffering still left dust behind.  After many months of searching I found this Panasonic.  My upright Panasonic has been a rugged, dependable machine, so I knew the brand would be a sound buy.  This vacuum is just perfect for wood/laminate/tile floors.  In addition it does great on area rugs (low pile) and it's a dream on stairs (carpeted).  Light weight, easy to manuever, with very good suction. Powerhead adjusts to wood/carpet and the rotating brush makes sure all dirt disappears.  Very pleased with this vacuum.

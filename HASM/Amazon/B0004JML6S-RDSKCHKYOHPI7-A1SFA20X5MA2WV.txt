Title: Nothing like the smell of plastic with your coffee...
Content:
I bought this model at Bed Bath & Beyond and returned it about 2 or 3 weeks later (they have an excellent return policy, by the way). There are two huge problems with this machine, as some other reviewers have pointed out. One, it reeks of plastic while it's brewing, and that smell filters into the taste of the coffee as well - and two, for being 1100 watts, the just-brewed coffee is definitely not hot enough. Some other problems: the latch for the swing-out filter housing is oddly placed, the removable filter holder doesn't seem to fit correctly, and the some of the digital "features" are more of a hindrance. Oh, no gold-tone filter is included, and not even a coffee scoop (standard items they used to include).
I don't know who took over the Krups company, but I want the real one back - they used to make great machines. I could have bought a cheap $12 machine from the knick-knacks aisle at CVS and been happier.

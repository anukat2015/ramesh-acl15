Title: High Priced, Low Performance
Content:
This computer has style. It has everything you need from mobility prospective - especially the Verizon broadband connection that complements the regular Wi-Fi ($45/mo plan required). The screen is sharp and bright, keyboard is ergonomic, fast boot mode is useful. Definitely for someone that is travelling a lot and needs a lite, stylish and connected computer - this is IT.
However, there are negative elements that you may consider in your purchase decision:
- Microsoft Vista makes it a VERY slow computer, with a lower than average performance index - including regular start-up, launching programs, video sub-optimal (I cannot watch iTunes or YouTube videos in normal conditions);
- touch pad and stick are very sensible - I had to disable them and use and external nano USB mouse;
- screen size is too small, text is very hard to read;
- GPS application is crashing often, the wireless/connectivity dashboard has to  disabled to use the mouse correctly;
- Internet Explorer 7 is crashing regularly, I had to use Firefox, Safari or Chrome.
- short battery life - about 1 hour with only one wireless connection on (all others and GPS are off);
- there are not useful productivity or multimedia applications installed, however there are all kind of obscure things pre-installed that take a lot of space;
- Microsoft OneCare is very slow and clunky;
- price is high, accessories are expensive, not a good value.
Overall, this netbook is not worth the price, better value and performance may be found in Asus eee PC or Acer Aspire One.

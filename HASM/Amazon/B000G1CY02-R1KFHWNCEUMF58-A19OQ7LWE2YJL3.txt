Title: No thermostat!
Content:
The description of this product clearly states, "Adjustable thermostat automatically maintains desired room temperature".  However, there is no temperature thermostat.  There is nothing but one knob for high or low power (1 or 2 setting), and a second knob labeled 1-2-3-4-5-6, 6 being highest.  No idea what actual room temperature these settings translate too.  I am very disappointed!  I ordered this over a Honeywell electric silent baseboard heater because the DeLonghi description said it had a thermostat.  
It does heat silently and pretty well, but it had a large dent on the top of the unit due to poor packaging and delivery damage.

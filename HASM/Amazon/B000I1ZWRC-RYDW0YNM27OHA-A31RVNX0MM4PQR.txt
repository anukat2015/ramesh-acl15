Title: Great camera!
Content:
I love this camera!  I won't get into technical details, but it's sufficient to say this camera is FABULOUS for amateurs.  I have 2 friends who use this camera for their business, and both have taken award winning photographs.  I have been using this camera for a month, and I love it.  I have taken some great pictures with the kit lens, however I will be upgrading my lens at the end of this month.  For this price range, you can't go wrong.  The large display is wonderful, and the controls are all easy to learn.  My best piece of advice to anyone looking to start this hobby, please learn how to use your manual settings!  If you're buying this camera and just plan on leaving it on automatic, you won't see optimum results.

Title: Nice design, Poor coffe
Content:
Krups has made a visually pleasing, simple, and sturdy piece of equipment in this coffee maker.  The carafe works well and feels solid.  The filter basket is a nice, single piece of plastic that hangs on the swinging, spring-loaded door.  A light-up LCD clock and display is easy to read and is surrounded by four comfortable buttons.  Unfortunately, the coffee is unacceptable.  I typically brew a 4-cup pot daily, 6-cups on the weekends, and 8 or more just once or twice a month.  Though the machine has a special 1-3 cup option, the coffe in my 4-cup brews was much too week.  Upon closer examination of the grounds, I discovered that they were not getting properly soaked.  Despite what appears to be a showerhead design, only the very center was wet and a deep 'well' was created in the grounds by the stream of coffee coming out of the center hole.  The resulting brew is weak and the majority of the grounds wasted.

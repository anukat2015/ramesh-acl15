Title: Good For Price
Content:
I've had this pot two weeks now.  NO problems with any type of spilling.  Brews quickly.  Coffee tastes great.  The basket refered to in an earlier review... can be a bit tempormental to straigten at times... but it isn't a big deal.  This basket is DISHWASHER SAFE.  I like that.  My last HB coffee maker's basket had to be washed by hand.  
Timer works great for that Coffee READY when you wake up mug!  If you want a brew strengh feature... (my last one did...) look for something else.  Although I have found I don't need it... even with only 1-4 cups brewing.
I spent $20 for mine... even if some think it's flimsy... (It's sturdy enough for me, I'm not disappointed).  $20-25 is like 10 cups of coffee spent at your favorite coffee stop... then it pays for itself!  I'd buy again.

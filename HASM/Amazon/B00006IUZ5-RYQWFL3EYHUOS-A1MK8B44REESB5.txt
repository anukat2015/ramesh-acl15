Title: Great for the office -- AND for those with younger children
Content:
I got a Sunbeam Hot Shot about 6 years ago.  It had been recommended by someone at work.  I used it at work every day (and still do) -- and have since bought another for home. It makes 2 cups of hot water -- and is great for everything  including tea, instant oatmeal and hot chocolate.  When my daughter was younger, it was great for her because she could make her own hot chocolate or instant macaroni and cheese, and I wouldn't have to worry about her being burned on the hot stove. With the hot shot, you just pour your water in the top and hit the "heat" button.  The machine will then shut itself off when the water is hot and you can dispense the water.  
This is a great product and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants fast, convenient,  and safe heating for hot water.

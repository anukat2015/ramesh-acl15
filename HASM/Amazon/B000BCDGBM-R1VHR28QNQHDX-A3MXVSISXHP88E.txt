Title: Just what I needed
Content:
This space heater is exactly what I needed for my office.  I like that it has dual settings (fan, low, med, high dial & a temp. dial), and that it doesn't constantly run.  The oscillating feature is great...it heats all around me instead of blowing right at one spot.  I'm glad I read the other reviews and was warned about the childproof dial, otherwise I might have gotten frustrated.  I also like that you can turn the heater off instead of having to unplug it all the time.  This thing has worked fine for me for the last two weeks...hopefully it will last a long time!!

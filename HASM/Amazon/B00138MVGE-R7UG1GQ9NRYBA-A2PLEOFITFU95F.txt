Title: Nice cam! Nice pics!
Content:
I enjoyed A350 a lot. The image quality is very high. I shot some awesome family pictures, portraits, our vacation photos: everything came out superb. For an amateur as I am it is dream camera! I user DSC-R1 from Sony before and it also was terrific camera. If you aren't satisfied with the pics from this cam you need some real expensive lens and pro level equipment. 
I'm very happy with this DSLR!

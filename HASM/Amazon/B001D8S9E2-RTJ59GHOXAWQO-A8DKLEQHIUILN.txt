Title: Best Computer Ive Ever Owned.
Content:
I have had many computers over the years, from Vaio, gateway, alienware and dell but nothing compares to the Mac. It runs smooth, its easy to use for a first time mac user and the computer is efficient in converting files for you. I was nervous about switching to Mac but now I couldn't be happier. Its also easily compatible with PCs. If you get iWork software, you can save as a word document and send it to a PC without problems. Editing the thousands of pictures I have is a breeze.I don't think I could ever go back now. Worth the investment.

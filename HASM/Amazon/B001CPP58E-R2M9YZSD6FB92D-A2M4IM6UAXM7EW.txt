Title: Worth the extra money
Content:
We have another DeLonghi heater for my daughter's room and needed a second heater for downstairs. We bought a cheaper one and it broke after 6 months and was really loud. Ended up buying this one to replace the cheap heater and wish I would have bought it in the first place.

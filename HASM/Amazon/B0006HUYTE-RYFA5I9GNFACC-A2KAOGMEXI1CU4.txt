Title: It's OK...
Content:
It does an OK job vacuuming uncarpeted floor.  On carpeted floor, I guess it's OK too, but I could only push but not pull.  On both kind of floors, the hose easily falls and ends up on my toe.  Why would they use metal to make the detachable hose part but plastic for the part that attaches to the vacuum.  Because of the weight, the detachable hose keeps falling if you don't hold it in place.  I wouldn't expect a $100+ vacuum has such design fault..

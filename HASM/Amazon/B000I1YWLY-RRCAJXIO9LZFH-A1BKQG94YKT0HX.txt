Title: Excellent product
Content:
I am in the residential cleaning business. I purchased it about 1 month ago and have used it repeatedly. I purchased this vacuum after reading the reviews expecting a well made, high performance product. I was not disappointed. I have used it to clean everything from lamp shades to upholstery to floors (and my car). I like the portability of the vacuum, the easiness of changing out attachments, the suction power, and the fact that I can empty the canister without any frustration with the filter because the filter is not in the canister. The double filter is also a plus and very easy to use. The ONLY thing that I would change if I could would be the length of the retractable cord. It is long but ....just not quite long enough for me. I am very pleased with this vacuum and when it is time to purchase an addition for the business it will be another one of these.

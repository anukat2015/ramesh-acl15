Title: Excellent Camera
Content:
My work recently bought the Canon Rebel XT with the 18-55mm lens.  I took it on a couple trips and to some sporting events and realized that I wanted a DSLR.  However, the Rebel XT is about $900, so I looked into other options.  A friend of mine recommended Nikon saying it was all she used.  So I did some research and decided to get this D50.  So 1 month and 1000+ pictures later, what do I think?  I LOVE it!  Even if the Rebel XT was the same price as the D50, I still would have picked this one.  The camera is larger then the XT, which I like because it fits my hand much better.  The XT is too small around the grip for most people, IMHO. 
In terms of picture quality, I don't think I could be happier.  I took some pictures at a baseball game the other day and was getting 1/3200 second shutter speeds and very clear pictures.  The only not so good part (which I also read about on dpreview.com and agree with) is ISO 1600 produces some slightly grainy photos.  So, the ONLY time I would use 1600 would be in LOW light situations where a printed photo won't be larger then maybe 5 x 7 or 8 x 10.  
Now the best part about having this camera, is there is a song about it.  Thank you Paul Simon.

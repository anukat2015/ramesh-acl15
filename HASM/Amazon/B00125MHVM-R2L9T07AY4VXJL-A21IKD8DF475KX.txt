Title: OK camera.. bad build quality..
Content:
BULD: The camera feels very plasticky to the touch. It feels less sturdy than i had imagined it to be. 
The features are what you expect any DSLR to have.
PICTURE QUALITY: The pictures are always a little softer than i would like. I have seen pictures taken by entry level Canon and Nikon cameras and their photos can be nice and crisp. I tried meddling around with the f-stop to get sharper images but they always turned out a tinge soft. 
BATTERY LIFE: OK. You can take it on a weekend trip without having to worry about recharging it.
OVERALL: I was disappointed with the overall performance of the camera. I would not recommend this camera to anyone else. I suggest going for a Canon or Nikon.

UPDATE: Its been a little over a year after buying the camera and it failed on me. The auto-focus mechanism doesnt work anymore and the camera is literally useless. Since i am out of warranty i went to the store and got an estimate for the repair. I was told it would cost me $298 plus parts. I am very disappointed with Sony.

Title: Durable and Delicious
Content:
This coffeemaker is amazing. The foam is wonderful and it has never let us down. Yes, it's a bit noisy, but all of the automatic makers are noisy. Actually, it's quieter than the DeLonghi that we got on sale from Starbucks and which we use for decaf in the evenings. Anyway, my only grief is that it appears the rubber grommet that seals the bottom of the water tank may be failing. I don't see parts listed for this maker on the Saeco website so I don't know what the future holds. But we are a busy, highly-wired coffee-drinking household so this machine has certainly done its duty and I'd recommend it to anyone.

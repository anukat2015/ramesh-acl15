Title: Amazing quality
Content:
I just got this laptop for my birthday. It was one of my best birthdays ever. I would definatly recommend this laptop to any one who wants a higher power of computing goodness.
Pros-
Wi-fi is awesome
No disk thinging. you just stick the disk into the computer. nothing pops out that can break
backlit keyboard
Time Machine
Trackpad is helpful
light weight
feels sturdy
Cons-
I only have two cons and these aren't that bad. 
1. is that you can't bend the screen all the way back. this is not a problem for me but some people may not like it.
2. my battery does not last the claimed 7 hours. It lasts 5 on a normal day and with blue tooth and airport off it will last about 6 and 1/2. 
Other wise it is great.

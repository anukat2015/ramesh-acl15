Title: Great for the price.
Content:
I received the Brew 'n Go a little over a week ago and so far it's been a good buy. The coffee takes all of two minutes to set up, another 10 to brew, and then two more to clean out the machine and add sugar. It's very quick and painless. 
I used to stop at a local shop every morning for coffee on the way in to work, though the Brew 'n Go takes a little more effort, the taste is comparable if not better. My only two complaints are that the built in filter allows too many grains of coffee grinds to get through and into the cup, and that the coffee could be a bit hotter coming out of the machine. It's the dead of winter here in NYC and after adding a bit of milk I'm drinking a cup of warm joe.

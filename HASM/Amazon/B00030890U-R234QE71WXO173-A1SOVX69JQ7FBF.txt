Title: Moroccan Red Coffeemaker
Content:
This is a terrific coffee maker. The color is slightly pinkish, not a fire-engine red, serendipity here: our new home has pink glazed tiles, and it looks fine! I based my decision to purchase on other reviews, and I am so glad I did. The carafe is absolutely no-drip; it is necessary to tip it upside down to completely empty it, but that is a small price to pay to avoid coffee stains on the tile grout. The coffee tastes great, and a full pot is ready in about 10 minutes.

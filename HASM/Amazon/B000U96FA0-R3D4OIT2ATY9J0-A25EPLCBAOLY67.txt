Title: So far so good
Content:
PROS:
- Pushes out a lot of heat, but will it stand the test of time?
- Takes up little to no space at all (I believe its a 1 foot diameter)
- Rather light weight, but you won't be knocking it over due to the base
- Timer to keep it running for a certain number of hours
- Unit rotates from left to right
- High, low and auto power setting
- Blue LED display
- Comes with a remote
CONS:
- Rotation speed is somewhat slow, and cannot be changed
- Thermostat reading increases faster than the room (since its on the heater)
Final Words:
After moving to Minnesota I figured that getting a space heater would help to reduce my utility bills, so I went ahead and picked up this unit. So far this heater has been getting the job done without the bulk. Its very portable, and I usually take it out the bedroom when I have guests... unless of course... ok, off topic. Now it will have to stand the test of time.

Title: BE AWARE!  PLEASE READ!
Content:
This is a very powerful machine....almost too good.  Do NOT leave the vacuum sitting on the carpet in once place for ANY extended period of time....Even with the highest carpet setting, my brand new carpet in my brand new house (not even one month old) got damamged because of the spinning brush that doesn't turn off when you are using the hose/nossle attachments.  I was in tears and everyday look at my damaged carpet.  Also, we aware if using on rugs etc....has tendence to fray these also - VERY POWERFUL SPINNING BRUSH....I am keeping the vacuum, but will NEVER use the hose attachment as I very rarely have an extra person sitting around the house waiting to hold to vacuum cleaner off the carpet when I want to clean the carpeted steps - what a pain!  Good vacuum - just be careful about your usage of it...

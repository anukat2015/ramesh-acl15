Title: Highly recommended - the endless research is done for you....
Content:
Quiet, powerful heater - recommended.   I spent hours on the internet comparing the various heaters, buying a few before understanding this is the one I should have bought first.      My concern is will it last over a couple years and are there contaminants in this foreign made item.   Some heaters are made in Canada and the USA.

Title: Nice for tiny, small, little residences.
Content:
I live in one story house that's not too big or too small, I can safely say that this vaccuum is a huge pain in the neck. Or should I say back.
Every time I use it, I end up with a back ache and sweating. The extention on the hose and handle is nice, but despite how long it gets, it always, always develops a cramp on my right side. I'm around 5'10" as FYI
When set on carpet mode, the brush for wooden floor still gets dog hair stuck on it so I have to frequently stop and pull it off to get it to get sucked into the bag. 
In addition, the cord is about ten feet too short for my taste. With my old vaccuum, a standard push-type, I could get the entire house in two outlets. Miel takes four outlets. 
For such an expensive, dual surface (which is kind of nice if not for the above problems) vaccuum, it's become the bane of my household existence. 
I will say that the small head size and multiple attachments are great for hard to reach areas. That I love.

Title: Leaky Coffee Pot
Content:
We've had this pot for six months.  In the first couple of months, the carafe started to drip water down the front whenever I used it to pour water into the reservoir.  At least a cup of water would run down the front of the pot onto the counter.  We sent in the pot and got a replacement.  That one leaks, too.  Also, it leaks water from under the machine.  After making coffee, if you lift the machine off the counter, there is leaked coffee underneath.  We have also had trouble with it not perking all of the water in the reservoir.  Sometimes there is up to 4 cups of water left in the reservoir when it is done perking.  When I go to fill the reservoir the next time (assuming it is empty) I have an overflow because of the left-over water that never perked.  This pot is a disaster.  Don't buy one.  P.S.  When we sent for the replacement thermal pot, Cousinart said that they would only replace it once....that should have been a hint that things wouldn't go well.

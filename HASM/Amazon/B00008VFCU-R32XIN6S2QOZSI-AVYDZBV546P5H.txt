Title: Potential is there
Content:
I just got this new toy and at my first reaction was wow...what a great toy. But be aware, the lyra is about 1 inch thick, so it is bigger than what is shown on the picture -- they jsut angle it so it look slim. Anyway, the firmware 0.17.10 SUCK, it made most of the divx movies unplayable while having the the stupid mpeg4-asp error message poping up. Luckily the new firmware 17.11 fixed this problem. Also, be aware that it only plays divx codec, and some xivx. As a result, you might be spending most of your time converting your darn movies you already saved into divx -- use dr-divx for this. Once everything is done the machine was a joy to use. It works beautifully. But, it is really bright though. So much that it might dim the color a little. The images is very sharp.the mp3 player have great sounds, comparable to the ipod.Anyway, you have to be patience with the thing, but once you understand it, its a great thing to use. This product has many gret potiential that i hope the next frimware will add on more goodies, maybe for format being reconize? shesh, how long does it take to get a licence. The fact that this product will only get better, conforts me. Beaware, this is for the computer savey, but the fact that your even thinking about it mean you must be savey about codecs in the first place.IF you thinking about getting the  the Argoes  instead, that toy is one is HUGE, and expensive, lyra is more bang for your buck.

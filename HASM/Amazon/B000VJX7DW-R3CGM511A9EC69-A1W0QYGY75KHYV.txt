Title: A great camera, better than the hype
Content:
I received my D300 from Amazon during the first wave of deliveries, right after Thanksgiving. I had used a D80 for almost exactly one year (15k pictures) and though I really liked that camera, the D300 blows it away. 
The other reviews here cover everything I can think of: it is an excellent, fast camera - the controls and ergonomics are excellent, the picture quality is excellent, the AF and and exposure modes are excellent - and nearly everything is adjustable.
I really can't think of anything I am unhappy about with the camera...ok, I wish the ML-L3 infrared remote from my D80 worked with it, but... this is REALLY a nitpick.

Title: Acer? hope you are not a typing racer!
Content:
Overall I'm very happy with this computer because it suits my needs perfectly and came at a very reasonable price. The biggest downfall and other reviews mention this is that the computer keyboard often misses keystrokes and for somebody that types fast this would be very inconvenient and annoying. I use it for writing short blogs, and short stories and though it can get under your skin a bit, it is nothing to shake a fist at especially with spell checker. 
Luckily, I was able to get microsoft 7 from my brother so that took care of that aspect. I don't understand why they would install a 60 day trial, just incorporate the cost of microsoft 7 into the price of purchase. I also deleted the 60 day trial anti-virus security and installed a microsoft security which saved me money (i downloaded it for free). 
The second biggest reason I use it is to watch videos. I find that the ACER arcade is perfect for this and the sound quality is great. Other reviewers mention that the touch pad is sensitive and so far it has had a minimal impact on anything I do (though when highlighting in microsoft word it can be a bit of a monster to control). Overall for the price of the computer it exceeds my expectations despite a few minor hiccups.

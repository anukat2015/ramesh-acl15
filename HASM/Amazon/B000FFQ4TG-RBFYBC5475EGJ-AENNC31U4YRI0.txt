Title: An excellent basic coffee pot
Content:
The coffee maker makes hot coffee in 3 minutes and it keeps the coffee hot. The warmer is one of the best I've seen. It does just like advertised. 
I replaced a cheaper model (not a Bunn) and haven't had any complaints.
Be aware though:
1. This coffee maker does not have a programmable feature. You will start getting coffee out when you close the lid. Provided you added water and coffee grounds.
2. There is no interlock to stop the coffee when you remove the receptacle. You will have to wait the short period of time it takes to make a full pot.

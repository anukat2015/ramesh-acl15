Title: good frothed coffee, bad regular coffee
Content:
if you are deciding what kind of machine to get, think of this:  do i want frothing or not.  if your preference is froth, then this machine is for you.  the frothing is excellent.  if you like regular coffee, i would go with kerug (sp).  when i got my machine, one of the glasses was cracked.  i emailed the company and they corrected the problem right away.  they do have good customer service.  the machine is nice, though mostly cheap plastic.  my main compliants are:  regular coffee is terrible, not a lot of variety of coffee, no organic coffee, and trying to find places to get the pods is difficult.  other single coffee pods are readily available at such places as walmart.  macy's no longer carries the machine or pods (at least in mn) and the only place i found was sur la table which is 70 miles away (one way) for me.  yes, you can get the pods from nescafe's web site (and some other sites).  you can also accumulate bonus points for free stuff.  problem with it is they only give you 5 points per box and you need 100 to get something free.  i would get a demonstration and taste if you can before getting this.

Title: Leaky, but effective
Content:
This thing leaks like mad.  I live in a fairly humid area (averaging about 70% during summer months), and it leaks about 2 gallons of water per day.  The little drainage spout on the bottom is useless -- no water actually passes through the drainage spout; it leaks out *around* the spout.
To deal with the leakage problem, I've placed the unit on a plastic crate (the hanging-file-folder kind), tilted the left-front up slightly, to encourage the water to run to the right-back side, and placed a two-gallon bucket inside a twenty-gallon overflow tub underneath the right-back side.
That said, it otherwise does a great job cooling the air.  A single unit and a few deftly-placed fans are sufficient to cool the second floor of my house -- about 1000 sqft -- during the hottest days of summer.

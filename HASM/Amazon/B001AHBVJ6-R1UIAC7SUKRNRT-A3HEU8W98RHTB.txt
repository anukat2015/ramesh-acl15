Title: Spend a bit more for this model with the stand
Content:
I'm delighted with this heater!  
The extra $25 or so is worth it for the telescoping stand.  That way you can keep the footprint on the floor, not on a desk's valuable real extate.  Radiant heat is more efficient since it heats objects, not air as convection heaters do.  
This unit is also light enough to move easily from a cold garage work area to a cold office area with ease.  The included remote (you were just HOPING for another remote, right?) allows controlling ALL functions -- 7.5 hr. max timer, swing, or HI/ LO heat -- without bending down to floor level buttons to do so.  
I've found the 400 watt low setting perfectly adequate, but I can think of nights the 800 watt high setting might be a Good Thing.  At 400 watts, I'm as comfortable or more so than with my old 1350 watt convection space heater.  I feel confident in the tip-over safety shut-off system, although the unit's body does heat up on the high setting.  
The only negative about this heater is its brightness, which can be distracting if it's placed in front of you.  But care with placement solves this fairly easily.  
Highly recommended.

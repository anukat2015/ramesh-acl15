Title: Great laptop with FEATURES!!!
Content:
I've had this HP notebook for about 2.5 weeks now.  I bought it to transfer my home videos from vhs and DV tapes to avi files and dvds.  So far I have been very impressed.  The i3, although at the low end of the intel "i" processors, for my purposes is FAST!  I downloaded a trial version of Corel's Videostudio pro x3 (subsequently bought the full version), which I also recommend for the video enthusiasts out there.  The hardware and the software complement each other as evidenced in the processing times in the capture, edit and burning stages.  One great feature of this HP monster is the Lightscribe-enabled DVD/CD drive.  [...]  have system and application freewares you can download from their site.  There are maybe a couple of hundred templates which you can insert your own images with and burn them directly on the media.  NO MORE PAPER LABELS! You will need Lightscribe DVDs/CDs, the reqular ones will not work.  I deleted some bloatwares (HP games, etc.) If you are doing videos, I suggest getting an external hard drive (1 to 1.5 TB preferrably) as the files take quite a bit of storage space, avi files in particular.  The WIFI feature is awesome... I surf the web regularly  piggy-backing on other networks around my area, even skype-video call my daughter.  It is bluetooth-enabled as well, but I have not tried that feature.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase... I will try to update this review later, maybe after 6 months of ownership.

Title: Nano 4th gen
Content:
Great update, cool motion/ level sensor and overall wonderful product. I use to have an iPod Photo and that iPod was a brick compared to this guy. Happy medium between the shuffle and the larger brothers in the iPod line. I use mine for workouts and walking to and from work daily. Holds a charge well and lasts longer than my prior version. The controls seem too sensitive and the locking feature tends to be a bit small, but the miniturization was what I wanted... Highly recommended unit for all uses.

Title: 2 Months later, Quit Working
Content:
I have had my Keurig for 2 months and its quit working already....I loved it while it worked though, but now I have to unplug it, replug it, wait for it to warm up again, then try pushing the brew button, sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes to finally kick in and brew a cup!

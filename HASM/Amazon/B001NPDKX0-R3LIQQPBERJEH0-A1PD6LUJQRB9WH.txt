Title: Amazing Laptop
Content:
About Me: Graduate engineering student, so I spend most of my life working on design codes/viewing movies/listening to music/playing computer games/IMing with friends on this machine
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The clear and sharp 16:9 display combined with the Dolby surround sound audio w/ the integrated sub-woofer and the little hp remote makes this laptop an ultimate media center platform. 
- The 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 processor, 4 GB ram and 512 mb Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT dedicated graphics make this laptop perfect for the gamer and the programmer.
- The 16" screen appears a little odd at first but works out to be perfect for viewing 2-page documents or 2 application windows side-by-side. Coupled with the number pad on the keypad, the laptop is quite suited to office productivity.
- The hard-drive shock protection provides significant peace of mind considering its upto 500GB of your life's work. The finger-print scanner has also exceed my expectations in terms of utility with very easy & convenient linking with any webpage account log-in information.
- Appears to have every port known to man (most of which I never use) but the useful ones are placed in practical places to avoid a jungle of overlapping cables.
- The HP Total Care and HP Media Smart software packages seem to a significant improvement from their predecessors.
- Its gorgeous (non essential, but always a plus!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The screen is a little too glossy, which makes outdoor use hard and long term use a little tasking on the eyes.
- The fancy underlit volume and bass/treble touch controls on the laptop look good but dont function very seamlessly.
- The lack of a latch on the screen is cause for some anxiety
- Comes with a thin protective sleeve which is extremely slippery making it more of a hazard than offering any kind of actual protection
- As a "premium" laptop, it should have come with a spill-proof keyboard
- Not HP's fault, but it comes with Windows Vista Home Premium which has its pros and cons. I'd still prefer Windows XP and am waiting for MS Windows 7.

I love it! Bravo HP!

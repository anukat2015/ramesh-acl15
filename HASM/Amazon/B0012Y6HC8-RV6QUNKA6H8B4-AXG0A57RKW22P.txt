Title: Smarter Than Me
Content:
This camera can do anything. It is easy to use yet it will still take me awhile to be able to tap the potential contained in the camera. Interface is easy to understand and you will be taking basic pics in no time. I do highly suggest you invest in the optional battery grip. Feels great and provides almost endless power.

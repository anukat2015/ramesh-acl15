Title: I couldn't be happier........
Content:
I haven't had a new computer in 9 years....I sort of lost track of the advances in new technology and I was forced to update myself last month. I decided on this laptop because it didn't have a lot of extra programs which I don't need and because the first laptop I ever bought was a Toshiba...... and it lasted a very long time. The old one still actually works perfectly but can't be updated and does not have the WIFI and all the new attributes....
This laptop has plenty of speed and gives me gobs of space to download my own personal software...As an astrologer, I need a very clear screen to look at charts and I need to pull up charts quickly to examine them. The screen is crystal clear and the resolution fits my needs. Everything about this laptop works for me. I don't do any *gaming* or use software that requires more RAM or MEMORY, so I can't vouch for that.... but I do know that adding memory is quite easy.
All in all, this is a great computer and I love the WIFI. Now I know what the rest of the world has been doing with computers for the last decade !!! I love it !!!

Title: Product really sucks
Content:
Bought this product from a retail store, looks good elegant but when it comes to heating, doesnt do the job well at all.... With attached stand heater is elevated and your feet will never get warm which I feel is important in winter, especially MI winter. Even though its a tower, heating portion is so small that you have to keep it really close. I seriously don't recommend this product for this price. I would say the price should be around 30-35 and not 49.

Title: Great Coffeemaker!
Content:
Love this coffeemaker, the thermal carafe in particular. The coffee still tastes fresh up to 3 or 4 hours, although after about 2.5 hours, I usually have to give my coffee cup a quick zap in the microwave. Hint: the coffee stays hotter longer if you've brewed a full pot AND if you rinse out the carafe with hot water first to warm it up.

Title: Awesome Laptop
Content:
This thing was made 5 years ago and keeps up with my brand new netbook. The battery life is amazing and it runs smooth. The only downside to this computer is the 40gb HD. But with networked and regular external drives, flash memory and such, it not that big of a deal. 
All in all, this is my first mac and I love it.

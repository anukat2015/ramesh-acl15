Title: Good Investment
Content:
I am very happy over all with this vacuum. It does a fantastic job. The dirt cup could be larger, other than that I was very surprised at how much dirt and cat hair I picked up the first time I used it. It is easy to push and the suction is excellent. I like the fact that I can pick it up and move it easily. I would recommend this product to anyone in fact I did, my sister bought one too.

Title: Hoover Commercial Portapower
Content:
Received the Hoover on time. Price was very fair. The vacuum has worked perfectly since it arrived. We use it for stairs and hardword floor and dusting. Also useful for our cars. It take a little getting use to using since it has no wheels and you carry it. However it's light weight makes the carrying very easy. You can get to almost anywhere you need to because of the extra long cord. The cord length is a real plus. The vacuum is strong and the attachments work very well. The Portapower is well made and uses good attachments. I would purchase the vacuum again.

Title: Better than $100 coffee maker
Content:
I first looked at some $100 models .. but then decided to keep it simple and I think this was a much better value for the price .. BUT .. the day after I ordered this coffee maker I saw the same model at Target for $20.  But I'm still happy with my purchase .. and I'm enjoying coffee from this model as I write this.

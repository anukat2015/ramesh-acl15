Title: Started out good, but did not last long
Content:
I'm new to making espresso and lattes, so lots of trial and error was required.  Out of the box, the machine performed well and true to other feedback, the frother worked extremely well.  The steam control knob was required to throttle steam flow to achieve micro-froth.  After using every day for 2 months, it now takes 20 minutes to make a latte and there is barely enough steam to froth.  If you're serious about making espresso, pay a little more and get a more robust unit.

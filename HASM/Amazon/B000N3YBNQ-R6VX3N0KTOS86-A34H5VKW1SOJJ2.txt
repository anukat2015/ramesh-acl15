Title: Electrolux Intensity
Content:
There are some good aspects and not so good aspects about this vacuum cleaner. It sucks very well. That's really the only good aspect.
Now for the not so good aspects: The cord is way too short. If you live in a cracker box, then the cord is long enough. Also, after using it for a short time, the cord dosen't retract as well as it should.  I have to help it along to go back in side.   The pedal for lowering the handle to get under things sticks and it's hard to lower.  
It's hard to push on carpets. So if you have a lot of carpets to vacuum, you might want to head to the gym and bulk up. 
The filter bags are small and have to be replaced frequently. And guess what - they're expensive. 
If you're reading this review you may want to keep shopping around for another vacuum.

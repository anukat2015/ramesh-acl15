Title: Mediocre Coffee
Content:
The Brew'n Go Personal Coffeemaker DCM18S makes mediocre coffee. I replaced a Two to Go coffeemaker, and was quite unhappy with how bad the coffee was--so much that took my old one apart and repaired it.
I'm thinking that the heating element probably isn't hitting the 180-195 degree temperature. 
It is nice ergonomically, feature-wise etc. But if my coffee maker doesn't make a good cup of coffee, I don't care about the other features.

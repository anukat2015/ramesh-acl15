Title: Disappointed
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker to replace a similar one that finally got so slow due to calcium buildup from our very hard water. It looks the same, but the coffee is terrible. The coffee has very little flavor and I can't figure out what is different. I am very disappointed in this and am now researching coffeemakers to find a better one. I have used Braun's for years, but will try something else next time.

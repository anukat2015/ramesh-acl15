Title: Love this vacuum, BUT the belt slips off too easily
Content:
I love everything about this vacuum except for one very important part, the rotator brush for carpets.  I specifically purchased this vacuum for all of it's great qualities including the large rotator head attachment.  From the first day I have had to deal w/many screws just to take the head apart to re-attach the belt.  I might have expected this to happen over a certain amount of months or years but not from the start.  I am not prepared to start investing in new belts and deal w/other possible issues involving replacement parts after just 2-3 weeks of use so I cannot keep or recommend this vacuum cleaner.

Title: Great Product!
Content:
I have been buying Holmes products for 15yrs.I trust the product because I have never had any problems with a Holmes product.This new HFH442-UM heater works great!My little mini pinscher dog Hans is crazy over it.I aim it toward his bed at night and he lays in front of it all the time with a smile on his face.I set it on low at 75 and it keeps the chill off.Doesn't run much at all.And it is so safe to run around my pet.When it was offerd on Amazon at a great price and free shipping!I couldn't pass it up.

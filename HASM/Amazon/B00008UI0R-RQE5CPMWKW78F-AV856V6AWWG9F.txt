Title: Hoover S3765-040 Vacuum Cleaner Review
Content:
The ordering and delivery processes were excellent.  The vacuum cleaner works well.  There are a few problems with the vacuum cleaner.  First, it does not provide all the brushes it should.  There is no dusting or upholstery brush.  Second, the suction control is very easy to hit accidently and it is difficult to see the suction level indicator.  Third, it requires a lot of man handling when cleaning a rug with the power brush.

Title: Nice and cheap but Vista on 2GB?
Content:
Looks great for the price conscious but it is not a MB Air look alike other than slimness. MSI makes decent but plasticky cheap looking laptops. Plus it runs Vista on the slow proc and a max of 2 GB ram. Ugh. I want 4 GB minimum for Vista and i prefer 6 GB. Might be nice with Linux if you have to settle for cheap hardware.  Windows 7 is more bearable on 2 GB but not much.  XP is archaic even though it runs well on minimal hardware like this.

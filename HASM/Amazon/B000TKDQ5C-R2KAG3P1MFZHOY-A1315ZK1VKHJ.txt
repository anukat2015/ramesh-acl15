Title: An Excellent Personal Heater
Content:
This heater is small efficient and gets the job done. It even has a thermostat that switches off the heat when the desired temperature is reached. Its perfect for a bedroom or other small spaces. Why heat a house when you want just a warm room ? :)
The only downside to this heater is that it is slightly loud. Its not a pain or major annoyance, but you can certainly hear the buzz of the fan. All said and done, this is a great product. I would recommend to anyone.

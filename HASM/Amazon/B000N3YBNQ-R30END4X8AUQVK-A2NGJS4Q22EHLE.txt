Title: Cleans great, but hard to use
Content:
We have had this vacuum for about 6 months. Cleans great, much better than our upright Oreck.  
But we have the same problems as many have mentioned - the bag is very, very small, the cord is very, very short and the vacuum is very hard to push.  For these reasons, I would highly recommend you look elsewhere.

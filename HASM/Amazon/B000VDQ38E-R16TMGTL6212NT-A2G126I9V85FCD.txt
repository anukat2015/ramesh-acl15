Title: The Vacuum God
Content:
Ok, so I had a few roombas and a Eureka Pet Vac that bit the dust. With me and my three cats shedding relentlessly, my floors were looking a bit like Cousin It had been visiting. I read the reviews on this thing and decided I couldn't spend another day without vacuuming...so I bought it. I have never been so thrilled with anything as to write a review before now, but I just had to give it praise. Here are some of my thoughts... 
* Yeah, it's a little heavy, but so what!
* Assembly was a breeze...a monkey really could do it.
* Ok, so I read one review that said when turned on, it practically ran away from the user...Ah, no, this did not happen to me. Also, another review said it sucked the insulation from her plug cord....Yeah, that didn't happen to me, either...and trust me, I ran over a few.
* It's a little loud...but, again, who cares. I don't think it constitutes wearing ear plugs.
* So I ran this thing one arm-length out and back in...that caked-hair I was talking about? GONE! Did the entire rug (6x9) in just one minute and all the fur was gone. I should be embarrassed about how long I went without vacuuming. 
* I was feeling a bit froggy, so I went over it again. When I was finished, the rug looked like it had just been steam-cleaned. That rug has never looked so new and pristine!
* Ok, so with just a 2-3 minute run, the canister was completely full! I read another review that said this Bissell picked up years of dirt...He wasn't kidding! I'm talking about a 6x9 rug here! And, no, the canister is not tiny. 
* My cat's bed has been severely neglected, so I decided to tackle it with the rubber attachment...Awesome job! Oh, yeah, and the canister was now filled half-way. I didn't think there was THAT much fur!
* I am so happy with this Bissell PowerGroom Pet vacuum...I dubb thee the Vacuum God and I'm going to take it on the road to show all my friends! No other vacuum has ever done such a great job for me.

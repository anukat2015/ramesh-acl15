Title: Good camera from Sony
Content:
The A300 sits between the featureless A200 and the A350. It's a good camera, with excellent dynamic range and one of the best Live View implementations out there. However, the kit lens is mediocre to say the least and as a result, the camera's performance is compromised. My camera was defective and even though the problem was not a serious one, I returned it and went for a refund, which I used to buy the new Olympus E520.

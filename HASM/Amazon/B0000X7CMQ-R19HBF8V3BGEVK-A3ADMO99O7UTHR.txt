Title: Never hot enough
Content:
We bought this machine a year ago and have kept it because we paid so much for it.   Sure it is easy to use, but the coffee is never hot enough.  Within the first 15 min of it being made it is sort of hot, never piping hot, and an hour after it is made it is only warm.   Today the twist on top to the carafe broke and we are so happy to have an excuse to buy a new coffee maker.   For sure it will NOT be a Zojirushi.

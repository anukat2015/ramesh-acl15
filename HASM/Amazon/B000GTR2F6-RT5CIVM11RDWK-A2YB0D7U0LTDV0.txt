Title: Love, Love, Love my Keurig!
Content:
This baby makes a great cup of coffee with no mess, no waiting, and no waste.  It couldn't be easier!  We are fairly picky about our coffee.  We would grind our own and it had to be Eight O'Clock Columbian Roast and fresh.  My husband thought a Keurig cup might be a nice occasional stand in for his regular pot, but after trying a wide variety of K cups from the sampler packs, he's found a new coffee that he likes more than his fresh ground Eight O'Clock... Caribou Blend.  We also love Newman's Own Organic Special Blend Extra Bold.  My kids have been having fun making hot chocolate as well as using just the hot water (hitting brew without adding a K cup) to cook their cup of noodles.

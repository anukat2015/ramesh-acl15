Title: This product rocks!
Content:
THE GOOD: Good price, lots of HD for the price, has an equalizer, is basically easy to use; can be recharged via a USB 2.0 port on a PC. Also, it looks good (if you need a snappy-looking MP3 player), the touch-pad control is very convenient to use and it's good for audio books too. 
THE BAD: No FM tuner, dinky earbuds, weird (incomprehensible to me at least) filing system if you're using a PC running Windows and you try to find individual files in the iPod using Windows Explorer. So, instead of being able to easily delete a few files here and there, it's easier to just restore (ie reformat) the HD and start from scratch. AND, the battery isn't meant to be changed by the owner - you're supposed to mail it back to Apple when the battery dies (although aftermarket batteries are available for the more technically adept owners). 
OTHER POINTS: Uses iTunes software to upload & download from, won't support music purchased from anyplace other than iTunes. iTunes is pretty easy to use, make sure your PC can run iTunes 7.6 before you buy an iPod!
RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES: Speck ToughSkin rubberized case for iPods & a decent set of brand-name earbuds.
CONCLUSION: The pluses outweigh the minuses as far as I'm concerned - I love my iPod! If you disagree, check out the Microsoft Zune or Creative Labs MP3 players.

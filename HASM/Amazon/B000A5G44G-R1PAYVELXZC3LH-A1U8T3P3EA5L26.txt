Title: Fine little heater...
Content:
I bought it when it went on sale, as it was then much cheaper than the utility heaters I could find in stores near me.  I'm happy with it, although sometimes I wish it was a little 'beefier'.  My old more utilitarian one had better airflow and seemed to heat the room quicker, but I think it was noisier in the tradeoff.  The DeLonghi is quiet and looks nice, the controls are easy to use, and the whole thing has a nice 'feel' to it.  If it forced more air through it would have been a 5 star rating easily.

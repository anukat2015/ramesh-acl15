Title: Happy with Everything
Content:
This Vacuum was purchased for my elderly Aunt.  She doesn't like uprights and canisters are very scarce now days.  She told me she loves everything about it. Everything!  She says it cleans great and has a larger beater brush than her previous vacuum.  She is absolutely thrilled.  My only concerns when purchasing it were reading other reviews that said that it fell apart relatively quickly or stopped working in a year.  She's only been using it about a month now but luckily no problems yet.

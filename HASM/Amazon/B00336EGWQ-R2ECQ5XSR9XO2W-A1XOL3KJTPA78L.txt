Title: Had problems
Content:
I like it but had problems setting it up. It gave the blue scrren of death on me a few times befor it got it to wrok right. It has been ok after getting updates for Windows 7. Unlike what a another person wrote it comes with dvd/cd burning software and a nice selection of pre-installed software. But if the blue screen happens again I will return it for a replacement.

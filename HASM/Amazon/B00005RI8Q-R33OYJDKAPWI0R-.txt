Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I've had the ibook for a little less than 5 months, and it has been alright.  Until recently, my most pressing problem was that Netscape would crash the computer at least once a day, but that was managable.  Unfortunately, 2 days ago it stopped working completely.  While the gentleman on the Apple Support line was very friendly, in order for the warranty to kick in for any repairs we had to take it to an authorized Apple dealer in order to diagnose the problem before anything else could be done.  That took a day and a half.  Of course the Authorized Apple dealer can't make the repairs, and it has to be shipped to Apple itself to be looked at further.  I could get the computer back a week from now, or it could be two months from now.  Who knows?  This is just been a very disappointing experience for me.  I'm not familiar with other notebook brands to steer people to, but I can tell you to not waste your time and money with the ibook.  It's not worth it!

Title: I love this item!
Content:
It's sleek design allows me to keep it out of the closet and out in plain site where I can easily access it. It is so user friendly, it literally glides on the floor. I can easily vacuum using just one hand while the other is holding a baby. Great suction on non-carpeted surfaces. I use it daily (sometimes more than once a day) for quick dog fur clean up and toddler messes.  Worth every penny!

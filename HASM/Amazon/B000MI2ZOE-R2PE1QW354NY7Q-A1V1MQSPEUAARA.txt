Title: Delonhi USA- The worst service for spare parts that you can imagine
Content:
I have an older model (PAC10) which is nothing I would recommend. It is huge although is called portable (it looks slim only from certain angle used in pictures) and was just very expensive for what it is. It is almost as noisy as window AC. If you really want European standard AC, that is quiet; energy efficient and does not need window or duct work, I would advise to check "mini split ductless" type of AC/Heat Pump (these need technician to install them though).  
The reason I write here is that at certain point you will need to buy parts or accessories from DeLonghi authorized provider in the USA, Fox International. This is the worst possible (unimaginable) service that you may get. I have placed an order 1 month ago and my order status is still "processing, check in 24 hours". Knowing that spare parts will be needed not too long after purchase, I strongly recommend choosing another brand.

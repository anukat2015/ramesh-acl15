Title: 0 star
Content:
Why I gave it one star? Because it doesn't even power on although I bought it brand new.  Of course I fully charged the battery! Of course i tried new batteries. 
I called canon, canon said I had mail it to canon for services and i have to pay the shipping to the factory. 
I asked how long to get it fixed and they said at least a month. I asked can I get a exchange and they said no. 
The body and lens are made with plastic. very cheap. 
For a product and services like this, it deserves 0 star. 
You gave it 5 star because you are lucky.

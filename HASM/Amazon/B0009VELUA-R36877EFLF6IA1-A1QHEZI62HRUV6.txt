Title: Best Coffee at the right Temp.
Content:
This machine is the best yet, my wife and I have been trying the "thermal caraffe" style and none of them keep coffee at the correct temp for very long. The DCC2000 keeps the brew right where it belongs for a full 12 cups.
Cuisinart has a winner here,

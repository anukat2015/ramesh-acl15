Title: Just what I remebered
Content:
In my childhood, my mother owned a Eureka Canister Vac.  I loathed it because it was so efficient at getting to the cracks and crevices that I was required to do that as one of my weekly chores.  Now I own a house of my own, and there are wood floors throughout.  I have been struggling to find the right vacuum, and in my searching, came across this one, which reminded me of chores at mom's.  I knew that if it was anything like the old Eureka's I would be in business.  I bought it, keeping my fingers crossed that Eureka still kept the same high standards.  I am very pleased!!!  I couldn't have asked for a better all around vacuum.  I can go from my area rugs to my wood floors without any hassles.  I feel like my floor is clean for the first time in months.

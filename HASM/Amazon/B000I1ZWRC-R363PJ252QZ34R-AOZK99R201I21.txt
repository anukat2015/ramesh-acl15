Title: Canon Digital Rebel is awesome!!!
Content:
I've been looking for a camera that doesn't produce blurry pictures, takes FAST pictures, & reduces red-eye, and this camera meets all my expectations and beyond!! I'm not a professional photographer, I just like to take pictures especially of my kids and this camera is perfect for my needs. It is very user friendly especially if you've owned a canon digital camera before. I replaced the canon powershot A520 because it was soooooo slow and took too many blurry pictures and lots of red-eyes. The rebel is so much better and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to take pictures.

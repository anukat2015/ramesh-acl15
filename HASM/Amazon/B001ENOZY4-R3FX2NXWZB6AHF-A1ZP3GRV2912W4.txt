Title: greater starter DSLR
Content:
Bought with the kit lens as an early Christmas gift to myself - and started taking some great pictures right away just on the automatic mode. Have been learning the M/A/P modes now, with pretty nice results. Wanting better low light performance to capture moving toddlers preferably without flash, I was trying to decide between the Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G SIC SW Prime Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras (not the Nikon 50mm f/1.4D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras with noiser motor), and to justify the extra hundreds to go from f/1.8 to f/1.4. Instead, because the 50 mm is really 75 mm given the 1.5 Dx crop factor, which is way too telephoto for indoor shots in my house, I got the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and have been very happy because it acts like a 50 mm prime and is an unbeatable combination of speed and price at f/1.8 and about two hundred dollars. I still think the kit lens is useful for the range, especially for outdoor shots when low light is not a problem. Back to the camera itself, it is like all DSLRs bulky and mildly obtrusive at events as compared to a compact or subcompact that fits in a shirt pocket, but that is the price for better pictures. A 16GB card will hold tons of RAW and up to 4300 jpgs. Video sucks because of the lack of auto focus, so it's okay for very short clips with little motion, not longer or larger scenes. Still, I think it's worth the price to have video for those moments when just a few seconds of video will capture the essence of what is happening, which would have otherwise been missed trying to switch to a camcorder (not that I would carry both at the same time). My only regret would be not willing to splurge for a full frame camera - yet.

Title: This vacuum really sucks--in a good way!
Content:
This is by far the best vacuum I have ever purchased.  You will be amazed on how dirty your house is the first time you use it.  I am still amazed on how much dirt and dust it picks up.  The bagless is fine as long and you empty it right into the garbage so the dust doesn't fly everywhere.  I still use my old vacuum to suck the filter clean.  A very good vacuum overall for you money.

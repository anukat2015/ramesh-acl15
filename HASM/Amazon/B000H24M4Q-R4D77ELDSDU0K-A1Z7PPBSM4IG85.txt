Title: Problematic
Content:
This things sucks literally--- the life out of any battery. The battery it came with died in 1.5 hours. I have tried three other batteries of different brands (one cheap Big Lots brand, an Energizer and a Duracell) and they get sucked dry quickly. Sometimes, right after you insert a new battery, it will already show that it has been depleted on the Mp3's battery meter. It has other good qualities but if you listen to it on the move a lot like me, consider something with better battery life.

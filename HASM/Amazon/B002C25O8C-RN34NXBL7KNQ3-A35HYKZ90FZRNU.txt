Title: Disappointed
Content:
Bought as a gift for my husband.  I owed Acer in the past and had no significant issues.  This labtop is lightweight and does have a good battery life, but that's where the good comments end.  Continuous connectivity, speed and freeze up issues.  Extensive time spent of the phone with Acer techical support (during their limited business hours and many "dropped" calls) and our internet provider.  None have resulted in solid resolution to the issues experienced.  Someone more tech-savvy may be able to wade through all these issues, but I am bailing on this one and asked for a return label.

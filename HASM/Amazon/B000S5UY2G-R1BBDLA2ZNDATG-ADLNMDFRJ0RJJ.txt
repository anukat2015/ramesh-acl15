Title: Total crap
Content:
Paid extra to use e-mail options while I travel.  The machine doesn't stay up to date with current software so in 3 months it no longer works to get e-mail.  I asked if they were going to fix this problem and they told me no.  Customer service is not open when they say they will be.  The machine has lost all memory several times and I can't even get it to download anymore to fix the problem.  With all the extra's I spent over $[...]. on a piece of garbage that is no good for anything after several months.  Anything would be better than this!

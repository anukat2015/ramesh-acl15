Title: great vac but wire short issue
Content:
I purchased this vac from QVC about 2 years ago, I noticed in last 2-3 months that power carpet nozzle was "cutting out" on power when dragging around. I took off extensions and touched the 2 wire prongs that connect for power (to main unit) and found that one was discolored and HOT so I disconnected another extension in center and it was hot too. We took it to local "vac clinic" in Lexington and found that we had to order 2 more extensions, there was a short in the wire and would have soon burnt up. My Mom bought the same vac about same time from Q and had same issue. My point is to BE CAREFUL, if this starts shorting out, get parts replaced, it cost us about $40 total to have repaired. I do love the vacuum though, it does a terrific job, I have 2 small mini schnauzers that drag in alot of leaves, etc and it does a great job.

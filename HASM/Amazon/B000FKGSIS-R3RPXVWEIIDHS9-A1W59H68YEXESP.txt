Title: So quiet!
Content:
This is a very quiet space heater - much quieter than any other I have had.  It is fairly powerful, too, but it does take a little while to heat up a room.  It is definitely not the most powerful heater on the market, but its quietness more than makes up for that.  If you can be patient enough to wait about an hour for full room heat-up, it's worth having this very quiet heater.

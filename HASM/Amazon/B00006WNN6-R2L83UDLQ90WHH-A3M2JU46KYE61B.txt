Title: tiny and hot
Content:
I bought one about a year ago without reading the dimensions and simply basing it on the price. Once i received the product i laughed and told myself "well at least i only paid $15 for it", wow was i wrong! this thing heats up a 10x10 room within 30min. Bought a second one 3 weeks after for another room and both are still working with no issues. If you need to heat up a large open room or expect this to replace central heat, keep looking. I read a few reviews complaining about the unit turning off on its own, its a feature when the fan setting is set anywhere between 1-5 where it senses the room temp and shuts off and back on when needed. To have it on non-stop just move it to fan setting 6.

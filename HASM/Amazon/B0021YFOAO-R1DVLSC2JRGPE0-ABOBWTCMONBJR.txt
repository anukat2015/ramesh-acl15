Title: HP dv6
Content:
I am getting to enjoy the additional video and music organization features of this laptop. I previously had an HP G60-235 but this one has better graphics capability along with better software for photo editing. The downfall is that it takes an extraordinarily long time to boot up either from being completely off or in hibernation mode. I think this is because it has a lot of trial software loaded that needs to be removed. Other than that I think it is an ecelent product.

Title: Great Item, Saves Time
Content:
I recently purchased the Mr Coffee Frappe Maker after seeing an ad for it.  I thought of the times I have had to stand in the long lines at the local coffee house, how many times they have made my Frappe wrong because they were in a rush to deal with the long lines and of course the cost they charge.  I figured for $[...] it was worth a shot.  The Frappe Maker gives you the control of strength of coffee or other goodies you may want in your drink, syrup, sugar, etc.  The ad claims in delivers the product in 3 minutes and it does!  I was personally delighted with the end product.  It will have paid for itself after a mere 20 visits to the local coffee house.  I am pleased with the ease of use and the convenience it provides.  I can make myself a Frappe in my own home saving time and money, this is a great product for those that do not have a need to impress others by drinking coffee house Frappes.  I anticipate many other copycat products following suit. Every so often a product comes along that is affordable and does exactly what you want it to do.......this is that product and it's affordable.  Try it, if you don't like it, return it, you will be surprised how convenient it is however.

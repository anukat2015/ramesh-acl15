Title: The best start into Canon DSLR
Content:
I bought this camera last month. I am very happy with it's performance. The kit lens provided is really good with IS within it. I utilized the camera fully on one of my friend's wedding and the outcome was really great! 450D captures every beautiful thing. 3.5 fp is enough to get nearly 40 shots in 10 seconds out of which 20 at least would be sharp and great. 
Only problem ( not sure if it is) I found with the camera is that, when I opened the cap of the camera where we insert lens, I found a tiny golden color ring lying inside detached. I am scared if it has been detached from an important part (sensor??) . Would be great if someone helps me out if they know about this.

Title: Electric Stove
Content:
This is a great little heater.  It is very, very warm and looks great.  It really kicks out the heat on those gray, raining Seattle days.  It's lightweight and really is cool to the touch ... well worth the purchase price.  We love it, and so does anyone who comes to our home.

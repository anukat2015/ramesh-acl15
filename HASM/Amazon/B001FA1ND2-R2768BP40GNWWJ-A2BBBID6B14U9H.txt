Title: Loving it!
Content:
I finally resisted the urge to join the iPod revolution. I have another mp3 player, but decided to get an iPod to listen to/watch podcasts. I canceled my cable tv because it was too expensive and I never watched anything but the news. I got my iPod so I could listen to my favorite news shows for free. Now, not only am I enjoying the news on my iPod, I'm listening and watching many other podcasts that I'm finding incredibly interesting and informational.  Haven't watched a movie yet so not sure how I'm going to enjoy watching that tiny little screen. I would've given 5 stars, but I'm not too happy with the shuffle option when listening to music. I'd like to just shuffle one playlist but the iPod shuffles all the music that's stored on it. If I wanna listen to Hard Rock, it kinda sucks when Sarah Bareilles is slipped in there. Maybe I just haven't figured it out yet. Anyway, Amazon.com had the cheapest price around. It arrived in about a week. And, overall, I'm very happy.

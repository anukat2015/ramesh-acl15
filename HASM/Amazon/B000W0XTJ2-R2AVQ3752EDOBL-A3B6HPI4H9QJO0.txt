Title: DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP
Content:
My wife and I bought this model back in September 2007. Today, the wireless stopped working and from the research I've done online, it appears that we are not alone.
Lots of reports of problems with all tx1000 version laptops.
I think it is because of the heat. These laptops generate a tremendous amount of heat. I think over time this takes a toll and kills the machine. From what I've read, this laptop is now on borrowed time. It could completely FAIL at any moment.

Title: Not as good as I had hoped.
Content:
I don't like the entire vacuum being plastic. Plus it is too lightweight.It keeps moving when I am vacuuming. It doesn't pick up very well on rugs. It does okay on my hardwood floors.But I do have many rugs throughout the house, so it would be nice if it had more suction  when cleaning the rugs. Was a decent price.

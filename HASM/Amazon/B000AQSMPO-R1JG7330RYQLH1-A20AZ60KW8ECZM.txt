Title: Terrific Coffee, Hot and Fast, from a Beautifully Designed Machine
Content:
I hadn't planned on buying a $200 coffee maker, but despite having squandered $35 on a lesser machine (manufactured by the once-venerable "initial-ampersand-initial" company) and some dreadful supermarket coffee pods to go with it, I was hooked on the concept of single-serve: no muss, no fuss -- and terrific coffee, hot and fast. As I tried to decide how to proceed, I happened to win one of these Keurig B-60's in an on-line drawing on one of the better-known single-serve sites. The machine arrived within days, along with four large boxes of Green Mountain k-cups in various flavors, enough to invite half of our small Texas town over for coffee and have some left over. 
I am VERY impressed with this machine, which is beautifully and wonderfully made. You won't be embarrassed to leave this one sitting on a marble counter in your beautiful custom kitchen. In fact, the Keurig B-60 seems to dignify its surroundings; if your kitchen's something short of custom, you'll want to design a new one around it. To sum up: great coffee, from a lovely, well made, quiet, and easy to operate machine. If only everything worked this well and looked this good....

Title: Effective, quiet heater
Content:
I chose this heater carefully to keep my bedroom warm at night.  I was particularly looking for a heater with minimal noise and good safety.  This heater is nice and quiet, as it doesn't have a fan.  When the thermostat turns it off, there's a little crinkly noise, but it's quieter than most conventional radiators.  The other alternative for a quiet and not-too-dangerous heater is oil-filled radiators, but you have to worry about them leaking.
It heats effectively and brought the room from fairly chilly (heat was off all day and it was 32 degrees outside) to comfortable within about 15 minutes.
My concerns are two-fold.  First, it is quite hot at the top.  Hotter than my ceramic heaters ever got.  Hot enough to melt plastic, but not hot enough to burn paper, at least not right away.  Second, it's rather tall and thin, which is great if you're wall mounting it, but makes it more of a tipping risk if you have kids or frisky dogs around.
If you have kids or dogs, I would wall mount this, out of reach.  If you don't have kids or dogs, and you have a safe spot to place this (not under curtains for instance), this is an excellent choice for an effective and quiet heater.

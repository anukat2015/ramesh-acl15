Content:
We received our HP Pavililion DV4-1547SB about a month ago.  At the same time we got the computer we bought an extended battery.  One of the first things we did when we gor the computer is use the camera to see our great grandson who was about a week old and hear his cooing.  We live in Kalamazoo, Michigan and our great grandson lives in Ottowas, Canada.  What a thrill for my wife and I to enjoy this technology.  The picture and sound were so clear. And of course, our grandson and his wife could also see us through the unboard camera located in the cover of this computer.
 
The computer is fast with the use of Windows 7, and by using PDF, I was able to send my Christmas with all its graphics by email to many friends and relatives.  This got my message out guickly and without the cost of postage.
My wife sits down with the computer on her lap to play games and send emails.  I use the computer to write articles.  I use both Word and Word Perfect for my word processing.
I am 77 years old and my wife is 79, and we find this computer easy to use and fast.  We looked up the manual on the internet, copied it, punched holes in the edge of the manual and placed iit in a notebook, so we can read up on any fine points we need to learn how to navigate.

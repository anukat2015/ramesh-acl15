Title: Proven Brand at a Bargain Price
Content:
I've owned an older generation 4-cup Mr. Coffee maker, and used it daily for 12 years.  It worked perfectly!  (I retired it only because it was getting too dirty to clean, after 12 years of use.)  Amazing!
This newer sibling to the tried-and-true is thus far living up to the task, and very well I might add.  I like how the lighted on/off switch is located on the front of the coffee maker, not hidden on the side where you have to feel for where it's placed.  The reusable filter (included) is a nice extra - costing about 4 bucks if you buy separately.  And it's much more convenient than the paper filters.
By the way, don't waste your money on a model with a timer.  It's small 4-cup capacity brews a full pot in only five or six minutes.  Simply click it on as soon as you wake up, and before you know it, coffee's ready!
I can whole-heartedly recommend Mr. Coffee.  Anyone who can produce a coffee maker that lasts for 12 years has my vote!
Note:  If you use a regular sized coffee mug and not the dainty little cups, you'll get about 2 1/2 servings per pot... just FYI.

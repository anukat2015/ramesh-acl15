Title: Wow!
Content:
I love to vacuum with this product!  I find excuses to use it.  It is lightweight, very quiet, and has incredible power.  I just ordered the turbo nozzle for it for my heavier carpets, and it's amazing what this little dynamo can do.  I also bought a very expensive upright that does great work on carpet but is so heavy and cumbersome as to make it not worth the effort.  The Antares does it all for me!

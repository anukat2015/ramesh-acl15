Title: machine died after one use
Content:
I got this machine on 02/10/10 because consumer reports wrote great reviews on it said it was the best. I had it 1 wk and 3 days and used it one time, the wand where you turn on/off didn't turn the machine off you had to unplug from the wall.I called Hoover and they told me to take it to the one & only repair shop for Hoover in Rochester,NY. I took it in and they said about 2-3 wks. (the circuit board had failed.) Well I waited 4 wks then called them and they said the parts from Hoover are on b/o status. I called Hoover and ask if they would replace the machine and the girl said yes you have waited long enough. Well long story short she didn't, she made me wait for the b/o parts. Then I called Hoover back and got a manager on the phone and ask who from Hoover is going to clean my house since it is going on 5 wks w/o a vacuum to clean with. She made a call that day to the shop and they told her the same thing they were told parts on b/o status. Then she called me back and said a new machine was on it's way. I did get it but by no means is their service up to taking care of the cust. All is ok w/ the new machine so far. But to have a circuit board go on the 1st use of the machine. Bad quality parts from Hoover.

Title: be prepared
Content:
I recently purchased this heater after reading the one review.I live in canada and had it shipped to a border store where I picked it up . The box was damaged from some kind of strapping , although the heater LOOKED ok.Once I got home and opened the box I was very UN- IMPRESSED ! The right side of the front panel was pushed in at both upper and lower corners,not too bad , I could straighten it out , not that I should have to.Upon further inspection I could not find how to hook up the vent. WHY ? BEcause  of the 3 small screws that hold the vent blower motor to the heat exchanger 2 were gone ( to be found in the tubes when I tipped it over)and one was barely holding on. It was flopping all over during shipping consequently destroying the heat proof gasket between the two parts.some DISSASSEMBLY required!I repaired the unit by purchasing a fire retardent material and making a new gasket and using a better quality stainless steel sheet metal screws.next I had to tighten 80 % of the sheet metal screws that hold the unit togethor inside and out. 2 nuts had come off the blower fan motor that holds it to the shroud, remove shroud  and blade,replace 2 nuts and washers ,tighten all then reassemble!!!! WHEW !  NOW I AM READY TO START INSTALLATION.   I HOPE it works better than , the condition it was in for a NEW heater. VERY poor quality construction if you want my opinion..

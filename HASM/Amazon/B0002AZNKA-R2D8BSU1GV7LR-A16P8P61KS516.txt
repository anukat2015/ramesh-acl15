Title: Better then Ipod
Content:
This player will give you the most music for your money hands down.  It is only slightly larger then an Ipod, but the ability to buy an extra battery far outweighs the size diffrence.  Another nice feature is the power supply is dual volatge so if you travel overseas all you need is a plug addaptor and you can recharge in any country.
I've had mine for about four months now, I bought it just prior to deploying to Iraq with the national guard.  I picked up the Nomad so I could bring my music collection with me and not be stuck dragging around cases of CDs, and it was one of the best purchases I have ever made.
A quick response to another reviewer's comments about repeating an album or playing any song at random:  You can do both of these with the Nomad, under music library if you pick "play any track" it will play your whole library in a random order, and if you wanted to repeat an album, just put that album on the playlist and change the play mode to repeat all.
All in all this player has all the function of the Ipod, but at a much smaller price.

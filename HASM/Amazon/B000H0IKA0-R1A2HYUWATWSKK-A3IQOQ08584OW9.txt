Title: about the size of a postage stamp
Content:
It is small in size but can hold 240 songs at 4 minute average per song, that's quite a bit for this miniature personal jukebox. I purchased this for my daughter and she is still very happy with her "Pink I Pod Shuffle".
She uses it everyday and changes songs at will. Could be a little less expensive,$80.00 is a bit steep, But all in all the point was it's a gift and it serves it's purpose.

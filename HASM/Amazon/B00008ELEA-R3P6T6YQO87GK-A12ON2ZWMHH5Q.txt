Title: Poor quality percolator
Content:
If I could, I would give a &quot;zero&quot; star rating for this product.  I purchased this Farberware percolator in April, 2001.  It makes good coffee, but the base cracked one day after making coffee.  I always took good care of the percolator, including carefully washing it by hand, so it didn't crack because of abuse.  It was just sitting on my kitchen counter when it cracked.  It was 1/3 full with coffee after making a pot 15 minutes earlier.  It is the second time this has happened to me.  The first time was with the smaller Farberware 4-cup percolator.  I strongly advise against purchasing this brand.

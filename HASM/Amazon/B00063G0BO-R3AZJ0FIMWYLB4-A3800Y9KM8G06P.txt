Title: DOES NOT SUPPORT M3U
Content:
The marketing material all claims support for playlists, specifically m3u files.  As of firmware 1.3 4/30/05, that is still an empty promise.
Cowon still claims that this will be added in a future firmware release, but they haven't released any updates in ages.
Aside from that, it's an excellent player.  I would give it 5 stars if it had the m3u support, and 4 stars if the manufacturer wasn't pulling a bait and switch with m3u support.

Title: Since everyone already covered everything...
Content:
... I'll just say how much I love this camera. A lot. If you're looking it up right now, chances are, you already want it. It's a great camera especially when you mess with the settings. Mess with it! Learn its settings to get some interesting pictures.
If you can find this camera bundled with the Nikkor DX AF-S 55-200mm in addition to its default 18-55mm, take that one instead. I did and it was hell of a lot less than what's it's going for right here. Totally worth it. Really good entry level camera with professional looking output of pictures. Spending more on lenses in the future for use of this camera is easily a possibility. 
The only complaint that I have is that there is no Auto-Exposure Bracketing, which would make HDR photography so much easier. Oh, and only 3 auto-focus points. I can live with it, but some people want more.
Make sure you buy an LCD guard that not only covers the screen, but the buttons as well. Dust WILL get in through the buttons and irritate you to high heavens, I don't care who you are and how you use it. The only way to get them out is to open it up yourself or send them in to Nikon for service.

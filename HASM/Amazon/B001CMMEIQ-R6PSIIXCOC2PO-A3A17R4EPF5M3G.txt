Title: Easy to set up
Content:
OK so I decided to unpack bulky box and install it this morning. It is heavy and big and the reviewer had me worried that it would be cumbersome to install.  Imagine my surprise - I found it to be a breeze.  The hardest part was getting it out of the box and down the hall into the office.  
My office has 2 of everything - computers, printers, etc, and has a very large full sun facing Southern California window; so it has been unbearably hot for years.  
I fidgeted getting a good seal in my large vertical sliding window but the moment I turned on the unit I was in heaven.  I set up the timer to turn off in 12 hours and sat down to write this review. I can only report on setup and initial operation, both of which I found to be incredibly easy.  The unit is quiet and blessedly cool - my office has never been this comfortable.   I am cool as a cucumber and loving my new purchase.
10/14/09 Just wanted to comment that it is over a year later and the unit still works like a champ.  This summer I rarely turned on my central air - when I am home I used this unit in my office - I was comfortable, my dog was comfortable and my energy bill was drastically reduced.  Still a winner.

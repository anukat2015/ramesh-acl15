Title: A good camera for beginners, but flimsy construction
Content:
The good aspects of the Canon Rebel series are easy to rattle off: the cameras are affordable, they're compatible with a large variety of Canon's incredible lenses, they can be set on full auto or fully manual (so you can grow into it), and they're compact and light. For someone unfamiliar with SLRs, this is a good starting camera.
The downside is equally simple: Canon Rebels don't last forever. I don't find it much fun to hold a camera with a plastic body, and it may be nerve-wracking to know that one minor drop could render your camera broken and useless. Canon makes many genuinely awesome cameras; the bottom-of-the-line Rebel is good, but not nearly so much as some of their others.

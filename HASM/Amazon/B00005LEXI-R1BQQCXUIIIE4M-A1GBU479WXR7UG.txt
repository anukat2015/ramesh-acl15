Title: Not for high elevation
Content:
This is a well made heater that works great if you are below 5,000 feet of elevation. However, most of the Rocky Mountain states have a low elevation of around 6,000 or 7,000 feet or higher. I wanted to use this at my place in Wyoming which is at the 7,500 foot elevation mark. It would only run for about 15 minutes before the oxygen sensor shut it off. It would probable be a great heater if it was used at lower elevations.

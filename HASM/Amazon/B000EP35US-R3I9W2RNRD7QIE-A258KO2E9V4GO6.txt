Title: Great for Live Music!
Content:
I have owned two MP3 players previously but never an ipod.  I decided to purchase one because my last iteration broke and because I am a big fan of iTunes.  What a lovely device.  I download a lot of live music; two things the ipod does that many other MP3 players don't: 1.) gapless playback and 2.) WAV playback.  This makes listening to my favorite shows easy and enjoyable.  The click wheel and the rest is fabulous.  The headphones are uncomfortable but not a major drawback -- easily swappable with another pair.  Maybe I should have bought the 8 gb version.

Title: Works very well
Content:
The radiator is just what I needed to heat up the basement during the winter.  Just be aware that there is a fuming chemical smell initially, and the packaging does have that as a warning.  You will have to at least turn it on for several hours prior to getting rid of the smell.  I would be a good idea to burn the smell off in the garage prior to putting it in the house.

Title: Satisfied Senior
Content:
As the head of our senior citizen Refreshment Committee, I was shopping for a 30 cup percolator after ours burned out. It served us well. Then my adventure began. They were 
nowhere to be found. All I found were more up to date models of coffee makers or others were 40 cups or more and the prices were outrageous. After exhausting all my energy I turned to Amazon.com and WHA LA! Not only did I find an exact replacement, but there was free shipping and no tax. I along with all the members of my club are delighted to be back in business. In the future I will look at Amazon before I wear out my shoe leather and my energy and I surly will recommended Amazon.com to all my senior friends.

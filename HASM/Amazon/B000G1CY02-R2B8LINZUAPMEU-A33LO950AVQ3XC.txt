Title: Inexcusably unreliable
Content:
They're every bit as neat and convenient as the favorable reviews say, while they work.  But mine simply stopped working less than two months after the expiry of its twelve month warranty period.  Power light continued to light, simply no heating at all. And nothing unusual about mine; well cared for and had only limited intermittent use over the six winter months I'd had it.  Delonghi technical service was unhelpful and unsympathetic; no flexibility on the warranty, no offer of repair assistance or advice, other than a telephone number to a Delonghi/ Kenwood repair firm  and the advice that it would probably be cheaper to buy a new one ( now just under $90) than to try to repair. All of which would simply be an upsetting individual experience if it were unusual.  But it's not. A substantial percentage of the customer ratings on NewEgg report exactly the same experience of the heater having simply to be discarded, unusable, within a short time of the expiry of the warranty.  I can only assume that the reason this is not reflected in the Amazon ratings is that these are written shortly after purchase, and before a quite widely experienced drop dead/ throwaway date just outside the warranty period.  Be warned!

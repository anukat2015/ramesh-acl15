Title: Small, but effective
Content:
This little radiator is perfect for the bathroom, on those cold mornings/nights when taking a shower is an experience you're not looking forward to. It fits nicely in a corner when not in use, and takes the chill off the average bathroom in about 15 minutes. I haven't used the timer yet, but just from looking at it and reading the instructions, I can definitely see how some other reviewers have found it a bit difficult to navigate. But all in all, this heater does exactly what I need it to do... warms up my bathroom.

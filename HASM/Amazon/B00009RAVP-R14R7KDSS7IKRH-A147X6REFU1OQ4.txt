Title: Oscillating Feature & Comparison to Presto Parabolic Heater
Content:
The two dials on the Soleus' base give me the FLEXIBILITY to control duration of the heat (up to 120 minutes), the distribution of the heat (Oscillating), and the temperature in a very SAFE and SIMPLE manner.  It helps to have this little dynamo distribute the heat for me; I really like the oscillating feature.
In comparison to the Presto Parabolic electric heater I purchased at Costco, the features I mentioned above, the Soleus far exceeds the Presto.  Also, I had to be careful about whether I used the microwave oven or any other devices or I'd be outside resetting the circuit breaker.  The Soleus is energy efficient; I can have all my ovens, and more, turned on while using it.

Title: So Far So Good
Content:
I've only owned this vacuum for a short time, but so far it has worked very well.  The suction is better than I thought it would be.  I vacuum a rug at my front door, so there are a lot of pine needles and sandy dirt, which the vacuum picks up nicely.  I'm curious to see how long this will go before the belt and the filter will need to be replaced.  The only attachment I don't like is the floor brush, it is way too wide, and doesn't feel like it is has as much suction, but it does seem to pick up everything.  All in all I am happy with this purchase in this price range.

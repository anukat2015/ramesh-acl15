Title: A great item...but  you must follow the instructions
Content:
After carefully sorting through the good and bad reviews and weighing each in turn, I decided to buy this product about 4 months ago. So far, I have been very pleased with the ease of use of the Grind and Brew. I have also found nothing wrong with the coffee's taste, contrary to the comments of other reviewers.  As an added benefit, the unit is aesthetically pleasing. 
To be sure, the item requires some extra attention. It can misbehave if not set up properly. You cannot overfill the bean container. You must also break down and clean each of the parts daily. 
I had only one instance where the filter basket overflowed, which happened because I overfilled the coffee bean container. It is just large enough to brew a full pot of coffee, so do not expect to use this product to make ridiculously strong, bitter coffee: buy an espresso machine or go to a coffee house if that's your thing. 
As for cleaning, yes the removable parts must be cleaned daily. It's true that the steam turns the coffee grounds in the bean container into mush. But a rinse of water, some scrubbing with a brush, followed up with a quick wipe down is all you need to prepare for the next pot.
The most surprising feature has been the stainless steel carafe. Although the coffee is never piping hot even immediately after brewing, it's adequately warm and drinkable for at least 4 hours. 
All in all, this is a great product. I hope that you will be as happy with it as I am.

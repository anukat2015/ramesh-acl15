Title: Good and Bad
Content:
Ok The Ipod Classic's are a step forward and a step back. First Apple purposely disabled the video out feature unless you use their cables. This is all for more Dollars which for how much these things cost and the money they make off them is just ridiculous. I have had several problems with this new Ipod from syncing errors to general data issue's I bought one of the first released so I believe it had to do with that since I got that unit replaced it has been fine. The Cover Flow is neat I don't know why people complain about it if you don't like it don't use it. So the good with the new Ipod models would have to be the space and then the cover flow feature which I like. The Negative points are as always - apple, their customer service, and the disabling of the video out for third party devices - just underhanded. It is still a great device so if you are not to upset about having to spend 50 dollars on cables than it will be a good bet for you.

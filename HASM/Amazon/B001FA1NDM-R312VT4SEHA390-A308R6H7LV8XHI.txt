Title: Great for the 3 months it lasted
Content:
I was a fan of my Ipod nano (Gen 1).  When it finally broke, I bought the Nano Gen 4 I had really beat up the Gen 1 and it survived a long time.  I took pretty good care of the Gen 4, and loved it until it suddenly was not able to charge up after only about 3 months of service.
Since it was well within the 1 year warranty, Apple quickly shipped a package for me to put it into and I mailed it back to their repair center.  To my surprise, Apple shipped it back with a form letter stating that I had misused it and checked off a box that I had either exposed it to some form of contamination or immersed it in some sort of fluid (magically without tripping the immersion indicator).  I know I had not done either of those, unless you consider normal dust as a contamination or air as a fluid.
(As a further slap in the face, the bottom of the form letter said that I would be charged $100 if I shipped it back to them again.)
I have switched to another player.

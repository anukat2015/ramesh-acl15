Title: B60 is all you need--Love it! Found nice bundle for less than amazon price
Content:
The B60 is perfect and no need to go for the more expensive models in my opinion.  The tall size setting fills my travel mug with room for cream without compromising the flavor.  only gripe is my travel mug does not quite fit under the spout so I either have to use a separate cup to brew or hold it under tilted while it brews, but big deal because it is sooooo quick. A very nice gentleman led me to Costco while I was looking at all the machines and they have a very nice bundle of the B-60, brew your own coffee filter and extra bundle of k-cups...for only $130. Can't beat that!

Title: A Good Product with  Faults
Content:
This coffee maker is a solid performer, with two exceptions.  There is a spring on the brew basket which sooner or later pops out, causing loss of ability to remove the pot to pour a cup during brewing.  It takes a while, but you'll learn it's gone when you withdraw the pot and the stream from the brewing process doesn't stop. Also, you have to be careful how you position the carafe, else the mid-process pour stopper will remain open, and when you return to sip a delicious cup you'll instead be cleaning up a mess.  Luckily the spring is readily available from a hardware store at little expense (it is usually lost) Hmmmmm....maybe this should be two stars? One? But really, it does a great job of brewing delicious coffee.  After going through three of these beasties, we know how to handle them.

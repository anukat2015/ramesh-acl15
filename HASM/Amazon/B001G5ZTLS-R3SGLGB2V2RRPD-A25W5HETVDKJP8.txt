Title: rating the camera, not the price
Content:
When I pre-ordered this camera at a quality camera store, I was number 150+ on the waiting list and was told this was the most anticipated camera to ever come out thus far.  I was able to get one from B&H quicker though and paid the normal price of $2700.  The camera is very well built with a sturdy frame, large 3" review screen, full frame sensor (which means it doesn't have the built-in 1.6 magnification as do most DSLRs.  This camera offers a huge upgrade from the 5D in the sharpness of images, ISO range, etc. I'm very impressed with the sharpness and color of the images.  I would definitely recommend it at the normal price.

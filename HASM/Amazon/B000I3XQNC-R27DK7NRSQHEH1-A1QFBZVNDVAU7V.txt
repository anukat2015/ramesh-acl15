Title: This Camera rocks.  You will not look back.
Content:
Even the very best point and shoots are junk compared with this camera.  Can't say enough about how cool it is.  It opened up a whole new world for me.  Now it takes a real effort not to be obsessive in learning about new lenses and how to use them.  As cool as this camera is with the kit lense, other better lenses take it to a whole other level.
If you are on the fence, just go for it, you won't regret it.

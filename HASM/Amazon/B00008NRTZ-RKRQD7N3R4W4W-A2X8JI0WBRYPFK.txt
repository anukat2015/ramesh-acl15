Title: Okay while it worked...
Content:
I have a large dog and a two cats, and this vacuum had a tendency to clog up with the fur. The suction was as good as a much more expensive electrolux vacuum, however I have owned the DigiPro for less than a year, and the beater brush in the power head has completely stopped working. (And the machine has certainly not been abused.)  It is not worth the $200 plus price.

Title: Amazing Camera!!
Content:
The Canon 5D Mark II is absolutely amazing!  It is worth every penny and I am very pleased.  I purchased this camera primarily for the Hi-Def video feature.  I do professional video work and I can't say anything negative about this camera.  This camera shoots video strait to an uncompressed Quicktime .mov file.  It is not AVCHD, there is no conversion needed.  These video files can be placed directly on to a Final Cut timeline without any conversion or rendering. (This saves soooo much time. i.e. no log and capture and no log and transfer and no conversion in any way!!)  Picture quality is amazing.  I only wish I could merge the features of the Canon XH-A1 video camera with the video quality and file format of the 5D!!!!  I have never really been interested in still pictures . . . until now.  I took a photo of some friends from 20 feet away, when viewed in photoshop with the zoom feature set to "actual pixels" the detail was as if I had used a macro lens from 2 feet away (This is due to the 21 mega pixels).  Everyone who sees the stills is amazed and I have already made money as a professional photographer!! (That's a first!)
Ok . . . the only thing about this camera I would change is I would give it XLR inputs and a manual gain control feature and a meter to visually monitor audio levels.  I imagine that if Canon did this they would lose business because no one would need to buy a pro video camera, they could just buy this!  Otherwise, the audio pick up is decent . . . it's good enough to sync with the audio from other cameras, and it worked just fine with a shotgun mic and a wireless lapel mic.

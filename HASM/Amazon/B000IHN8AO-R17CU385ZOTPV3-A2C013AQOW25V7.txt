Title: THE BEST DSLR in its Price Range
Content:
Before I get K10D, I experienced with Olympus E-500, CANON XTI, Nikon D80.
I used Olympus E-500 to take lots vivid color pictures that I love very much, but no water resistance and no second Display window, also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable. Same thing happen to Canon XTi, no water resistance and no second Display window make it little hard to use when you need to change settings. The Nikon D80 is a great camera but also have no water resistance and shake reducer build in on camera, the color tone of D80 isn't the kind that I would love. Finally I bought Pentax K10D, the feeling of the body,the water resistance, shake reducer,auto dust remove,vivid color tone,etc...makes me feel the K10D is the way to go. Only complaint would be the Limited Edition Lens are hard to get. Get it while you can!

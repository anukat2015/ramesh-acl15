Title: Great suction!  Little hard to get used to, but I like it.
Content:
Getting used to a new vacuum cleaner is a little like having to get used to a new husband... a little difficult at first but you kind of settle into it.  I love the suction power of my new WindTunnel.  I also love not having to spend money on bags.  The large handle of this vacuum is a bit awkward for me to hold, and with the controls right at the top of the handle sometimes I accidently push one while I'm vacuuming.  But, overall I really like the vacuum cleaner.

Title: Not working after only 3 months
Content:
After only three months, the On/Off switch is defective, rendering the machine inoperable.  The machine received light use, weekend only for the three months.  I'll report back after I've gone through the return process and let you know how that goes.
UPDATE:  I called Cuisinart to report the problem and they shipped me a replacement which arrived about a week and a half after my call.  They also arranged for UPS to pick up my defective coffeemaker.

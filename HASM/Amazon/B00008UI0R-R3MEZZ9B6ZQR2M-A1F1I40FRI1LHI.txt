Title: Very pleased!
Content:
I researched vacuums and was truly grateful for everyone's review before mine, as it helped in my determination.  I love my little "R2D2"!  The power is awesome, the versatility is spot on and I love how familiar I am with it already (like an informercial!).  It does everything and makes cleaning stairs a snap.  I no longer have to sweep my wood floors everyday...with my asthma it's no fun.  I vacuum more and breathe better.  Pick one up!  Great price!

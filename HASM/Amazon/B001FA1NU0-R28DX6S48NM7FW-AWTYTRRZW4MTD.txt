Content:
I bought this item for use when walking/running and during downtime. The charge time is fast, and it lasts for quite a while in use and on standby. I could not fit the advertised amount of songs on mine, I suspect maybe it is an estimate. I have approximately 180 songs loaded. The only other problem I had were the ear buds were too large for my ears and uncomfortable. I was concerned about the size, as it is not much larger than a postage stamp; however, the bright pink color makes it easy to find. Overall it is cute, very functional, easy to use, has high sound quality and it is fun! Oh, one more thing, I was supposed to get 15$ worth of free music from amazon, but never did. I imagine customer service will clear this up for me when I call.

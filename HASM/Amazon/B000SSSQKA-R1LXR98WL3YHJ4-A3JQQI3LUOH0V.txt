Title: Need to get used to it
Content:
When I first got this my cleaning lady refused to use it.  Since then I'm cleaning the house myself.  I have mostly wood floors--  the first time I used it I realized it wasn't picking up at all-- then I noticed that the roller was not spinning because I had something caught in it.  After I cleaned it out, and adjusted the controls, the suction was much better.  I love that it gets all the way under the bed and the couch and the long retractible cord is a very nice feature.

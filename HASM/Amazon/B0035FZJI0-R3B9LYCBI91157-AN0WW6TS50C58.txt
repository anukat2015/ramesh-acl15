Title: Love it!!!
Content:
T2i is amazing.  Whether you want a nice HD camera for fun, to take some pictures, to start a Photo/Video business or to produce an Indie Film...the T2i is a great option for the price.  If used correctly the Video can come out looking VERY Cinematic.  Slap on a nice L Series lens, shoot in 24p and use a Glidetrack for some dolly shots and you won't believe the results.
I loved it so much I bought a second one.  My only gripe is the sound and the lack of manual control in that area...but I record all of my audio on an external device anyways so it's not THAT big of a deal.  It's just that, every once in a while I'd like to go out and throw on any old mic and get some decent audio...and I have yet to really do that.  
Small gripe for me personally.  You may need to invest in a Rode Shotgun mic to get some decent audio if you don't record externally.

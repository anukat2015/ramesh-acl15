Title: Not very sturdy
Content:
I got the Optimus Infrared Quarz Radiant Heater a few weeks ago and am happy, It gets the job done as advertised: it heats quickly and quietly my bedroom.
The only drawback is that the material quality of the heater is pretty poor. You can tell that it won't last much-- it seems pretty fragile, made of low-quality plastic and having the grid and bulbs quite exposed without much protection.
Also, the functions are quite basic: 400 or 800W (one or two bulbs) without having an actual temperature control. I might have preferred something a bit more expensive but with more control and possibly a timer for auto shut-off.
Anyway, it is a good deal for around $25.

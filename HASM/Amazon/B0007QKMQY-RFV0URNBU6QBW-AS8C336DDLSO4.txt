Title: Excellent camera still worth seeking
Content:
This camera was my first DSLR and it turned into my springboard into photography as a near addiction.  Though Canon has rapidly expanded its entry-level EOS line, this is still a great camera to seek out as its price is falling pretty rapidly.
The obvious downside to buying this camera is that its screen is much smaller than just about any LCD screen currently on the market.  Its a good screen, though, and be sure to check your histograms regardless of camera.
8MP is a fine pixel count, there is more to a good picture than the the number of pixels on the sensor, and if you shoot in raw you will be able to get decent sized prints, if you print at all (I rarely do).  Even the "large JPEG" mode is great for smaller prints like 4x6/5x7 prints.
What this camera's low price allows you to do is spend more money to get the good lenses and other equipment that you will use well beyond the life of one camera (hopefully).  Yes, the APS-C sized sensor creates that 'crop factor' but it is workable and there is a wide range of compatible lenses designed for Canon's EOS line.  In addition, I would recommend picking up the 430EX flash, as your indoor photography will greatly improve with something better than the pop-up flash.
I have been very satisfied with the results and it is a great way to get started in DSLR photography, which is a different experience from point and shoot cameras.  If you are unsure about what your shooting demands are, or whether you even want to pursue photography more as a hobby, the Rebel XT is great camera.

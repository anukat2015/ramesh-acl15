Title: It's a scam
Content:
This is the latest design of the iPod Shuffle. I had the older version until it broke (long story), so I'm comparing this to the older model. The new model has the control for volume and rewinding/fast-fowarding on the headphone portion. The only reason I can think that Apple would do this is so that if you lose your headphones or they break, you have to replace them with...Apple headphones. Further, the control for rewinding/fast-forwarding only allows you to move from song to song and does not allow you to skip a few seconds ahead or behind. That's problematic if you're listening to a long file (for me, I listen to hour-long lectures) and want to go back a few seconds; you can only go back to the very beginning of the ENTIRE file. 
In sum, Apple needs to go back to the drawing table. A new version of something is supposed to be an improvement, not a leap backwards.

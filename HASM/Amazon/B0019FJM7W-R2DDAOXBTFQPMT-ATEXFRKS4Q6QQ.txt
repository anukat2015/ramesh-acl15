Title: Olympus e520 is super
Content:
After extensive research of beginning level DSLRs and finally waffling between the Canon eos Rebel XSi and the Olympus e520, I picked the Olympus for my first DSLR.  I am extremely pleased.  I have taken pictures under all sorts of circumstances and on different settings and am very pleased with the results.  The Olympus is easy to use and can cover a range of situations.  As of yet, I have not had any difficulties or problems. The camera arrived in just 3 days after ordering and was just as advertised.  I'm having a ball!

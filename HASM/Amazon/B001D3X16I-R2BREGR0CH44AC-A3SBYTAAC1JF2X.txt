Title: Zen Mosaic
Content:
I find the Mosaic easy to use after the initial quickstart. The Creative Central program is fast and effective for changing file extensions to something useable, for syncing from your computer, and organizing your files. Mine works well with Vista.  The tech support responds quickly and is helpful.I should have bought the skins with the order.
I gave the 4 gb to my daughter who loves it and I have an 8gb Mosaic because I love audio books, lectures and podcasts.The video is clear and music sounds good. The built in speaker isn't that great-you won't wow a party with it. The navigation is easy unless it's dark-needs a backlight or something. But there are 9 control buttons so maybe just apply a little memory to the fingers. I reccommend it.

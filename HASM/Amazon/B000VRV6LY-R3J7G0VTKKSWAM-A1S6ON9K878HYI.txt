Title: Purchase from Cameta Camera
Content:
Cameta Camera provided excellent customer service for this purchase.  The camera was refurbished and came with dust spots on the sensor.  I did not notice them until I was on a trip, about two weeks later.  Cameta's customer service responded immediately to my e-mail with an offer of a full refund or exchange.  I am impressed with their overall service so I am doing an exchange.   I consider them to be an A+ company.

Title: Mousepad SUCKS BIG TIME
Content:
DO NOT BUY...till they fix the mousepad on this thing. This thing seems to have gone through absolutely no QA before being shipped. 
I've been using HP's and Dell's and heard a lot about Lenovo's so went ahead and bought this one. Nice laptop with a good LED screen and i5 processor but what's the point if you can't work it using the mousepad. It is beyond horrible - the mouse has a mind of it's own. Does not follow the finger well at all. Sometimes I'll keep moving my finger and the mouse would be left behind somewhere. Just grabbing a window slider to  scroll a window is a hugely frustrating task. I've tried all kinds of mouse setting available but nothing seems to make this better. And the buttons are all part of the mouse pad. On my HP I can move the mouse and hit the left/right button using just one hand. No such luck on this one. You need mucles to depress that button and the fact that it's built into the mousepad instead of being separate buttons makes it even harder. So now you need two hands - one to move the pointer around and another to depress the mouse.
Going to talk to Amazon right now  to figure out what to do about this. Once I started using this and figure out the mousepad is so horrible - I thought I got a bad piece so I googled. Apparently - it's a known issue but Lenovo continues to ship defective laptops. My first and last Lenovo for sure. Don;t know if I can [ut in links but just seacrh for Lenovo trackpad/mousepad issues before buying....

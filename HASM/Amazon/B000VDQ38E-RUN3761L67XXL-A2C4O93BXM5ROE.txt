Title: My 3rd and worst Bissell
Content:
This is my 3rd and worst Bissel vacuum. I've loved my last 2 Bissells. However, this one doesn't pick up nearly as much as my old Bissell, the one I was replacing and that one is at the end of its life and not picking up well at all! I'm very disappointed with this vacuum. I'm going to call Bissell and let them know. Save your money on this one. Try the Bissell Momentum. A MUCH better product and a little cheaper, too.

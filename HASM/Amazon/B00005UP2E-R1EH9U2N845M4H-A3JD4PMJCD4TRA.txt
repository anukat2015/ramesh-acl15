Title: Dirt Devil 082500
Content:
My mom and I like this vacuum for corners, wood floors, kitchen floors, small pick ups and car cleaning. We like the bagless filter. Dump and go. Sometimes, we tap it outside to get rid of fine dust/dirt. We like the long cord, long hose and attatchments. We've had this vacuum before so we were happy to find it on Amazon.

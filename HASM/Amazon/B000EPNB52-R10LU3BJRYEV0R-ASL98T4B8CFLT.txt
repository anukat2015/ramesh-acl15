Title: NO A/C Adapter??!!
Content:
The nano ipod does not come with an A/C adapter. You have to purchase this separately...How silly!  For this price, APPLE needs to include this as not all people who use it have a computer or always have one readily available with a USB port.  My mini ipod came with one so I assumed this would also. This part of the nano package sucks, but the nano itself is slick.

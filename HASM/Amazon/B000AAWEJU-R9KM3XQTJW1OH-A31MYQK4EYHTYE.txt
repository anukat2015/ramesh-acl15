Title: Like my vacuum a lot, but didn't buy from Amazon.
Content:
The vacuum is great.  I've had it for over a year now.  It's amazingly quiet, even on the highest setting.  Only a couple downsides.  One is that the cord is a little short, but we have a one bedroom apartment, so it's not too big of a deal.  Two is that I wish that the attachments were stored in/on the canister somewhere.  The more expensive models are that way, but too expensive for me for that feature.  Oh well.  But as for a vacuum, it's quiet and does very well on our wood floors.  I like that the motor also has a 7 year warranty.  Hopefully nothing will go wrong with it.  The more expensive models have an automatic motor cut-out feature if you get something stuck in the hose and the motor starts to overheat, but if you pay attention to what you're vacuuming and know the sound of something wrong, then you should just shut it off and you won't have a problem.
I bought my Miele Carina vacuum from Witbeck Vacuums online.  Free labor repairs (if you'll ever need them) for the first 5 years.  Came very quickly in the mail too.
Again.  Really like our vacuum.

Title: this is good for outdoor heating only, but works very well
Content:
use this in my green house in the dead of winter. I turn it way down by carefully cutting down the valve on the tank. the low setting is almost too high for my needs. But, I can get several weeks of night time operation out of one 4.6 gallon tank of propane. if you turn it up, it really puts out a lot of heat. Oh yeah, dont touch it when it is glowing red!

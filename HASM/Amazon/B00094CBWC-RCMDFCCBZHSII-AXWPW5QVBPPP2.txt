Title: Perfect heater for Small to Medium rooms.
Content:
This is a perfect heater for guest rooms, bedrooms, and office type spaces. It has preset temperature settings starting from 60 up to 80 degrees fahrenheit in increments of 5, and automatically turns off and on when the setting has been reached or falls below respectively. Granted, the immediate temperature around the heater may not coincide with the room as a whole, but the differences are small. The heater also has two manual settings (High heat - 1500 watts / Low heat - 1000 watts) that will provide continuous nonstop heat until the user chooses change the setting. These two settings will heat a room to a cozy 85 degrees.
One of the key advantages of this heater over other fan-forced heaters is it's quiet factor. I am able to sleep and study with this heater on 24/7 (I keep it on High most of the time). It does generate minor sound due to the heated air being forced by the fan, but it is soothing, and in fact serves as a nice replacement for external sounds coming from outside the room being heated (for example T.V's, dog barking at night, etc.). There is no noticeable mechanical noise assosciated with its operation. It also has an elegant and compact design.
For anyone concerned, it does not support a seperate 'fan only' button, only heating options. It does not oscillate, does not have a remote control, and does not have a 'tip-over' safety shutoff feature (it has a wide base though).
I own two of these heaters, and I had to return one of original heaters due to a malfunction. But these problems usually crop up within the first 2 weeks of operating any heater, so once you pass the break-in period, the product should work beyond its warranty.

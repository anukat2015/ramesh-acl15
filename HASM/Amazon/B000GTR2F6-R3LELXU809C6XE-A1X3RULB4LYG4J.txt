Title: Shuts off by itself!
Content:
DO NOT BUY THIS B70!!!! Unless you want to buy a new one every 2 weeks like we have done! We are now about to take it back for the 3rd time! At first we thought maybe it was our electricity in our newly constructed house and a problem with our breakers...however upon googleling this issue, I can easily see it happens all the time! It will work fine for about a week, then just start shorting out when it tries to pull water from the reservoir! So annoying! You have to stand there and turn it back on over and over again to try and get one damn cup out of it...and it won't even fill the cup up to the selected size! It's been filling up 4 oz when I choose the largest mug size! This one is going back too. Not sure what we will get in it's place. I am a little sick of buying these expensive landfilling plastic cups! And I miss my D&D coffee!

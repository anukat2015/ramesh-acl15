Title: Serious design flaws
Content:
When this vacuum works as it should, it's great. However, it has serious design flaws that make it not work well or not work at all. There is a severe bend in the suction path at the handle and a connection assembly inside the handle that severely restricts the suction path. This results in clogs at the handle that are difficult to clear and cause a complete lack of suction. I've also had to clear clogs in the middle of the hose. One reviewer said that there is no suction and no clog. I suspect that there is a clog but it's not easy to find clogs in this handle/hose configuration.
A second design flaw is in the power brush head. The belt is stretched over a spindle that makes the brush turn. There is nothing that holds the belt on other than friction and it slips off easily if anything stops the brush from spinning. This may be intended to prevent the belt from breaking and it seems to fulfill this purpose. However, to get to the belt to put it back on requires removing and replacing seven screws some of which aren't easy to get to. Since the belt comes off fairly easily, it's a major inconvenience to have to disassemble the head this way. A final problem is that the retracting cord mechanism is now stuck in "retract mode"

Title: Value for money
Content:
For $26 its definitely worth the money. The temperature control isn't exactly the most accurate. You don't have a temperature scale just markings from off to hi. There are two heater settings, lo and hi. The heater fan is a little noisy in comparison to the honeywell heater. Honeywell HZ-7200 Cool Touch Oscillating Heater w/ Smart Energy Digital Control Plus
But for half the price its a pretty good deal. However if you want a quieter heater go for the honeywell.

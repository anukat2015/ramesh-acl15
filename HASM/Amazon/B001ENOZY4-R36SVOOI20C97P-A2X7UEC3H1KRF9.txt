Title: My first jump into a dSLR
Content:
The D90 was my first jump into the world of dSLR's.  I have always loved taking pictures and would use a mid-range point and shoot digital camera to do so.  I would then use Photoshop to enhance the pictures to make them more creative or to correct shadows, color, etc.  With the D90, not only has my love of taking photos jumped to a new high, I find I have to do less "Photoshop-ing".  This camera takes wonderful pictures if know how to use it.  For me, it took only a few short weeks to be comfortable with aperture settings, shooting speeds, and focusing modes on the D90.  Take the time to learn the camera and you will have a great experience with the D90.

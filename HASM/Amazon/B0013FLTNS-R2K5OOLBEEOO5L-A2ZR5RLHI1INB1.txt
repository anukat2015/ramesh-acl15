Title: 10 minutes to freedom
Content:
A mere 10 Minutes after I opened my new MacBook Pro, I had it up and running and I am writing my review here with it.  And that 10 min. would have been lessened had I not dawdled over the Apple screen cleaner and the user guide and so on. This is a sleek and fast machine; though it can get a bit warm on the left palm-rest I am loving this new machine. I'm adding Parallels and VM Ware Fusion as well to port over some of my Windows files. [BTW: You need Fusion only if you intend to run any 64-bit OS. And if you have XP like me Parallels supposedly runs it faster and more seamlessly according to Macworld]
I am looking forward to a low-calorie Windows life now. :) 
Amazon even beat out a Mac Mall an identically spec'd refurbished MacBook Pro with this deal and with far less rebate hassle too!
I could not have had a better experience with this entire purchase than through Amazon. Their tracking and quick delivery is exemplary. And this experience IMHO, is what the Mac Malls & Fry's of the world should be shooting for. 
Kudos both to Apple and Amazon.

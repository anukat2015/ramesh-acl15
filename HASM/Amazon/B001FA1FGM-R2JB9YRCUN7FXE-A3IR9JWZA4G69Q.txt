Title: The Best Heater!
Content:
Last winter, we went through about a half dozen heaters and none of them provided us with enough warmth to keep us comfortable. Then, we stumbled upon the Sunbeam. We use it in our bedroom, which is like an icebox during the winter months. It keeps our room nice and toasty, but not hot. We use the eco setting. I love all the features, including the digital temp readout. We don't find it loud at all and I am a light sleeper. It doesn't appear to put out a lot of heat. But you have to remember that it's convection and the hot air rises and circulates, creating a cozy feeling.  Personally, I think it does best in enclosed rooms like bedrooms. We had tried it in our living room, which has a vaulted ceiling and it didn't work as well there because it is such an open space. We have an open floor plan and it would just take much longer to heat it. I would definitely recommend this heater. It is by far the best one we found!

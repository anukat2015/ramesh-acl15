Title: Excellent Coffeemaker
Content:
After years of putting up with poorly-designed, poorly-built coffeemakers, it is a joy to finally own one that is so good. I bought it after seeing the reviews here & at Consumer Reports and noting that the price is about as reasonable as you can get. It makes great coffee. Uses standard filters. Doesn't drip. Brews the coffee quickly. Stays on for 2 hours. Has an easy-to-see clock. The scheduler works as it should. Cleanup is simple. There are few moving/replaceable parts, so the chances of failure are quite low. I am SO happy I found this machine and can highly recommend it.

Title: THE worst vacuum that I have ever had.
Content:
I got this vacuum as a gift. It worked for about a year then the hose began to separate ... yes thank goodness for duct tape.  Even went as far as to looking into getting a replacement hose, but it would've cost me close to $90.
Since I no longer could return it and after another year of suffering with this cleaner, I bought a Roomba. I'm hoping that it is much more reliable than the Duros.

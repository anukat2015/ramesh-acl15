Title: Miele Callisto Canister Vac Review
Content:
I read all the reviews on Amazon and googled other web pages.  I have been thinking about getting a new vac for 2+ years, waited because of the price.  Bit the bullet and went to the local dealer store in the next town(Dublin Vacuum, Dublin, CA)for a test.  I was planning to buy a lower priced model that did not have a power brush.  Vacuumed the carpets there and liked the small powered head that came with the Callisto.  Both heads work very well, power for carpets and parquet for hardwood floor.  My other vacuum was a 20+ year old Hoover (hand me down) and I never had such nice clean carpets.  I don't sneeze when I vacuum and the machine is easy to use.  I hope the vacuum lasts a long time so I don't have to buy a new one.

Title: Good Gadget
Content:
This is my first time to have an ipod. I could say I am satisfied with the product with regards to music playing. Design is cool. Battery life is good only for listening. It dies out quickly with playing videos or games or when the display is always on. I think the display eats up large chunk of power. I think the accelerometer is cool, I was amazed playing a game that needs tilting the ipod. The shaker function could have been better if it works when the keypad is locked. It is easier pressing one button than shaking the gadget.

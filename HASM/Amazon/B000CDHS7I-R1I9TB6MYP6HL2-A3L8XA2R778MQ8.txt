Title: Works great, excellent coffee
Content:
I read lots of reviews before buying this coffee maker and most of the concerns were completely non-issues. The "bubble" issue is nothing. Its happened once in two months and was easy to get rid of by tipping the machine. Never happened again since. The design of the carafe is much better than the similar Cuisinart model. It has a thumb opener to allow the coffee to be poured and it works very well, you don't have to tip the pot almost upside down like the Cuisinart one to get the coffee out.
Coffee tastes great, stays hot as long as you would reasonably expect it to.  The timer programming could definitely be easier to use and remember.

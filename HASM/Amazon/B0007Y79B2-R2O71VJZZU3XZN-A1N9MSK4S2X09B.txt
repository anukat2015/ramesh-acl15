Content:
Well, really this is a great purchased. I love the product, I feel very confortable with the item. The only complain that I have is regarding to the new model that is now about 8 GB and the price is better than the one I bought. Mine cost me 234 dollars and is 4 GB and the 8GB cost about the same. I know that matter does not have anything to do with you, but I want it yo mentioned because maybe another customer have to take care about this.
Thanks a lot.

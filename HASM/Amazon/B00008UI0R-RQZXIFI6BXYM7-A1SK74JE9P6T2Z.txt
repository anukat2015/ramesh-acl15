Title: requires too much maintenance
Content:
Cleans good but the tiny dirt compartment needs dumping after 10 minutes of vacuuming and the filter needs cleaning every 3-4 times you use the machine.  Cleaning the filter is a big messy job that takes about 30 minutes to do properly.  
I wish i would have purchased one with a bag!!!
update:  died after one year of weekly use.

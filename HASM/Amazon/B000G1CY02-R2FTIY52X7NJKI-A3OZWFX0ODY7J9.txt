Title: BEST HEATER FOR THE MONEY
Content:
I purchased this heater after reviewing several heaters on the market. After reading consumer reports and seeing their review of this heater I decided to try it. This is a very good heater and will heat a room very well and is also a safe built heater with several safety features built in. It is very portable as it has casters and weighs very little so most anyone can move it very easily.I also purchased another heater which is a baseboard heater at the same time I purchased this one. The baseboard heater has a digital readout and can be set very easily but it is very hard to tell if the heat is radiating as it travels straight up.I would recommend this HHP1500 over any other I have reviewed.

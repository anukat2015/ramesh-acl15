Title: one of the best investments I have made
Content:
I love my iPod!!!  No, I didnt just get sold on the hip marketing, but as a techie, I can use it as a portable hard drive and copy data to back up Win and Mac machines in a flash when I work on people's computers.  Even though it is supposed to be compatible only with usb 2.0, I have been able to use it on my old Win usb 1.1 box too.  
It is also very durable - I have accidentally dropped it, left it in my car a few times during stifling summer heat, etc, etc, etc, but - much like I found with my other Apple products - it still keeps ticking!  
I was also looking at the Creative - but it wasn't compatible with iTunes which I had already bought a bunch o' music through.  I just wish it was compatible with .wav/protected windows media files...

Title: Loses suction fast - short battery life
Content:
When I first started using the Kruz I was blown away with how well it worked on my hardwoods and linoleum floors in my bathroom and kitchen.  The honeymoon did not last long, however.  
On a good day it will take me about a half an hour to vacum my entire upstairs (only about 1000 sq ft).  Within fifteen minutes of starting to vacum the Kruz starts to lose suction power.  If you are using the Kruz for small pick-ups and clean-ups I suppose it would be okay.  But, if you need to vacum larger areas of hardwood and linoleum I would recommend a plug-in stick vacum as you will get more power out of it.  
In summary, if the battery life on this thing was longer than it is I would love it.  But, with the current battery power it does not meet my needs.

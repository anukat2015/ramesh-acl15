Bought two of these, one for wife and myself, after about 10 uses mine now comes on when it feels like it. For no reason, no water, nothing, it will come on and get hot, shut off then maybe an hour later do it all again. Even though booklet warnings say to unplug when not in use or for cleaning, you would think something with this brand name and an ON switch could be left plugged in. Note I checked the warnings on my toaster and it says the same, to unplug. I guess that covers liabilty. Anyways I just wanted buyers to know in this case you better keep it unplugged when not monitored. No problems with coffee maker other than that.

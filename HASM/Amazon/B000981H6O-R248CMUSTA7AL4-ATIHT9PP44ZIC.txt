Title: Great Hand Vac for the Price!
Content:
I needed a cordless hand vac for the stairs, and this one works great. It picks up all the big fuzzes and small rocks that get tracked in, and it even handles spills in the kitchen! It may not be the very most powerful hand vac, but for the price and quality, it cannot be beat.Hoover S1120 Hand Held Wet/Dry Hand Vacuum Cleaner

Title: A very good product!
Content:
I purchased the Compaq Presario CQ60-21OUS 15.6 Inch Laptop for my wife as we are full time RVers and don't have room for desk top machines.
This machine far exceeded my expectations when I ordered it. It looks nice and operates smooth; it is fast considering we are a long way from an AT&T tower and can't access 3G.
The Compaq has enough programing installed to satisfy someone like my wife that uses mostly the word processor, the installed games, and e mail. She also likes to store and work with digital photographs, which does require a better program than the one that came installed on the computer.
The display is bright and clear, a pleasure to use. The computer is lght enough to be comfortable on a lap and also runs cool enough that heat is not a problem.
All in all, we are very happy with this computer and if need be, we would purchase another one like it.

Title: Great coffee maker!!
Content:
We have had many different coffee makers over the past year trying to find one that was perfect...this one is!  The coffee is HOT, great taste, easy to program and use.  The "Brew Select" button is awesome!  When making a small amount of coffee, you select this option to have the water soak in the grounds longer to produce the perfect taste!  Also, the way the coffee maker is designed, it fits perfectly in the corner!

Title: Great Unit, easy to move around
Content:
So I looked around locally before ordering such a heavy device online, but it was cheaper with free shipping so how couldn't I buy it?  I was a bit worried when it came, because the box was so big, but its mostly padding, the unit is very respectably sized, and while it has some weight to it, the wheels make it super easy to move around.
The unit is easy to understand, works great, I wish I had bought one a long time ago.  I use it in the garage so I can have guests over during bbqs (I live in a townhouse-like setup, so have to bbq outside my garage), and it does a great job of keeping it cool.  Being in Vegas, the real test will be this summer, but I have confidence it'll make a noticeable difference.

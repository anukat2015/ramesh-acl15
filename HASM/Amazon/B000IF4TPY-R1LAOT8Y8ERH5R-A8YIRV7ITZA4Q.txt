Title: Exceeds my expectations
Content:
I bought the Zen Vision W primarily to download movies to the device and watch them through my regular television or while traveling.  It works flawlessly.  The screen is gorgeous.  I cannot believe the quality for a 4.3 inch display.  It's very similar to the PSP.
The video quality through the television is much better than I had expected.  It looks better than my video iPod.  I can see no difference between this and a DVD.
The battery life is excellent.  I watched a 2.5 hour movie, with some pausing, and still had at least half of the battery life left.
The menu is intuitive.  It did not take more than a couple of minutes to figure out how to navigate through the menus.
My only real complaint is that you apparently cannot have the device plugged into AC power when it is hooked up to the television.  It causes the video signal to be scrambled.  But given the low battery usage while watching videos, it's not a problem.  You could probably watch two full length movies on a single charge of the battery.
A complaint I would direct at Amazon is that you cannot transfer rented movies from Unbox to the ZVW (or any other device, for that matter).  This is not clearly spelled out when signing up for Unbox.

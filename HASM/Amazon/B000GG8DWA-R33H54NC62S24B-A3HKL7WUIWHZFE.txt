Title: Nice little heater
Content:
This is a nice little heater, but it does get very very hot so be careful.  It will not heat a room but is very good for warming your feet or legs quickly.  The cord is a little bit short at 5 ft., I would have liked 8 ft., but it's not bad.  Overall, it's a very simple and effective design.

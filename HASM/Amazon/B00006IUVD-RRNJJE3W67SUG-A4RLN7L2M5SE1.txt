Title: 4th one I've bought (over 8 years)
Content:
I hate cleaning these coffeemakers, not that it's hard, but it's easier to replace them every couple of years.  At $10 each, the mug alone is worth it.  I've been making single cups of coffee way before all these pod systems came out, I love this coffee maker... GET ONE!!

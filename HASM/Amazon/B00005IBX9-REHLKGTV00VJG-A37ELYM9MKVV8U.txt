Title: My Dream Coffee Maker
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for a year and a half and it's been great.  I like to make a pot of coffee to savor over a couple of hours - this model is perfect for that as you can set the heat plate on low and the coffee won't taste burnt.  In response to other reviewers, yeah, you do have to be careful when you pour the water in so you don't slop it all over the place, but this is a very minor inconvenience when you factor how well this coffee maker performs in other areas, and I don't find it to be worse a problem than with any other coffee maker I've had.   Overall, this coffee maker makes the best tasting coffee I've had at home, which to me is really the bottom line.

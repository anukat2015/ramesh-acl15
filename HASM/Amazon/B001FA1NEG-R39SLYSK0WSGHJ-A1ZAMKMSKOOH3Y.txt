Title: its awesome....
Content:
this ipod is defiantly the best one, in my view. not only that the color rocks, but cover flow is cool. the large screen can be helpful watching videos, podcasts, or just playing games. i recommend this one if you just like to listen to music, play games, and watch videos on your ipod nano, (although it can do much more, too).

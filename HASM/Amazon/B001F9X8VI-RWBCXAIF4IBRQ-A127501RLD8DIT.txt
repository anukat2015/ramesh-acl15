Title: Quick heat for small and mid sized rooms.
Content:
Picked up this heater at one of the "mart" stores a few months ago. It warms up a small to mid sized room pretty quickly. It has a molded handle built into the top of the heater, making it easy to carry from room to room. Its a little bigger that some of the other personal sized fans in the same price range. Has a digital clock. You can set the heater to turn off/on at certain time. Also has thermostat controls to turn on/off when certain temp is reached. Can also set heater to stay on. Also has a fan only (no heat) setting. It is listed as a bathroom fan, but it works fine in any room. It has an ALCI plug to prevent overheating. It's a little too bulky to mount on a wall, but sits just fine on a table or on the floor. Flat gray plastic body. The plastic body stays warm to the touch even after an hour or more of use. Only the metal grate in front is hot (but not burning hot) to the touch. Overall a good quality heater/fan combo.
Pros:
-Heat is quick and strong. Good directional heat.
-Good size and weight. Not too heavy, Sturdy enough plastic body. 
-Easy to pick up and move to another room. Sits flats, no worries about tipping over.
-Timer, clock and thermostat controls to regulate temp and running times.
-Safe for use in bathroom or other slightly damp area.
Cons.
-Uses a lot of electricity. Saw a noticeable change in electric bill after frequent use. Lights in room dim for a second when heater is tuned on.
-No heat or fan level setting. Its ether ON of OFF. No LOW, MED or High setting for heat of for fan.
-Control take a little while to learn. Luckily they printed instruction on side of heater.
-Clock resets to blinking 12:00 when unplugged and plugged back in. No clock memory.

Title: Solid machine
Content:
I bought this laptop as a replacement for my Dell Vostro 17" notebook.  I chose this model because I frequently connect to client networks while working out of the office and needed Windows Professional.  
So far the computer has ran just fine.  It has an overall appealing look to it, and the screen produces a very sharp picture.  
The one feature I didn't expect to like very much as become one of my favorites.  The finger print reader is a really cool tool that allows me to save all my login information and login to all my websites with just a swipe of my finger.
I definetely miss the 17" display and full size "ten key" on the right side, but I've learned to live with it.
Overall I'm happy with my purchase.

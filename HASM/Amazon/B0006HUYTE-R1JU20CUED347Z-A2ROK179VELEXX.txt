Title: Good vacuum
Content:
I was pretty happy with my new purchase (at a friend's recommendation) until I used another similar-type cleaner (at our church) that had wheels on the floor attachment. Not having this does make the floor attachment difficult to manuever at times. My favorite things about this cleaner is the strap to carry it on my back, and changing the bags is very easy. The short cord is somewhat of a challenge.

Title: Works wonderfully
Content:
I bought one of these's heater's to help heat my three bedroom, 2 bath mobile home.  I shut off two of the bedrooms and a bathroom and it keeps the whole rest of the house warm.  It's opened though out the livingroom, kitchen, dining room, laundry room and the master bedroom and bath.  So far even with the temp's dipping to 35 degree's the main house heater only comes on once or twice a night.  This is saving on a lot of propane that I just can't afford being on Social Security.  Would recommend this product to other's and plan on buying another one here soon.
thanks,
Judy

Title: Excellent add on for Mr. Heater
Content:
I bought two of these hoses to attach to two 20lb propane tanks.  Attaching to 20lb propane tanks is a huge savings over using the individual 1 quart propane cyclinders.  Hoses work very well.  The only thing to remember when attaching the hose to 20lb propane tanks is that the couplings are left hand threaded (i.e. you must turn to the left to tighten).

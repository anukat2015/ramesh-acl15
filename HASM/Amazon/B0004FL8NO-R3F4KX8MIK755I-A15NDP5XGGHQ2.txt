Title: Great as long as nothing breaks
Content:
I was very happy with this coffee machine until I dropped the carafe on the ground and the handle broke.  You have to struggle a little to pull the carafe out of the machine so it's easier than you might think to drop it.
Anyway, I called Black & Decker to see if I can replace the handle and I was told that my only option was to replace the carafe - at a price of over $50.00 including shipping.
A very satisfied customer has been instantly converted into a very dissatisfied customer.  My husband and I are going to try and make a new handle, but I probably won't buy a B&D coffee machine again.

Title: Gets the job done, but is a little noisey and lacks some functionality
Content:
I purchased this heater because our house has wall heaters out in the hallway and in the living room, but none in the bedroom.  So on cold nights we'd have to leave the bedroom door open and use the hallway heater to heat the hallway, and in turn the rest of the house - not very economical.
The good: 
** Remote control is handy
** Puts out plenty of heat to heat a medium sized bedroom
** Noise level is okay on the low heat setting
** Lighted lcd makes reading the settings easy at night, but turns off after a few seconds so it doesn't light up the room
The bad:
** As others have reviewed, the thermostat feature is great but the heater only operates in high heat mode when you have the thermostat feature enabled; in which the fan speed is high, and if you are a light sleeper like me it's enough to wake you (my wife slept right through it).
** It has no memory, so when you power it off, and back on, it forgets what mode it was in and what temperature it was set on; not a  big deal though because you can turn it on and set the mode/temp in a snap w/ the remote.
** When in thermostat mode the temperature seems to vary a bit.  The manual claims it will heat to 2 degrees above your setting, then turn off until it gets to 2 degrees below your setting.  So basically +/- 2 degrees, but it feels like more than that.
Bottom line: If you don't care about a little noise and temperature variance, it has lots of other great features and gets the job done.  However, I did end up returning this and got the silent Honeywell wall heater which I'm very happy with, mainly due to the silence.

Title: Great for the gym or running.
Content:
I wanted something lite and easy to use running and at the gym that would not get in the way. The controls are simple and easy to use and the battery seems to last quite a while since I only use it about 2 hrs at a time. The two gig is plenty big enough for any and all music you would want.

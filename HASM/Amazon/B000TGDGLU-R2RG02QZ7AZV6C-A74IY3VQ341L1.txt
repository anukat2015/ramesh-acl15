Title: Does exactly what it's suppose to do.
Content:
I bought this heater because my house's heating leaves a lot to be desired (luckily only renting).  Placed in a large open area, this heater won't do much but it will kill a bad draft.  However, place it in a closed room and this little buddy will make it nice and toasty in no time.  It makes a clicking noise every once in a while, but nothing that comes close to bothering anyone, and for $50, it definitely was worth the cost.

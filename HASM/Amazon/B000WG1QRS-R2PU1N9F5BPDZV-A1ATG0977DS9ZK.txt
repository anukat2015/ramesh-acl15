Title: Bad hardware, worse software
Content:
As soon as I got it, I tried charging it and it wouldn't charge. I went on the net and tried all kinds of different things to drain the battery and charge it but none would work. Finally after three days, it said battery at full charge. But that was just a false positive. After playing the radio for five minutes, the battery charge dropped to zero.
Another drawback is that files can't be copied without the software. In that brief moment it was working, I installed the software and imported a bunch of videos into it. I tried clearing the videos from the software and it deleted all the videos from the disk!!! Thankfully, Amazon refunded the amount when I returned the item. Not worth the pain it causes.

Title: This does the job
Content:
I bought two of these on the basis of recommendations written here and so far I'm not disappointed.  
Both worked fine out of the box (no quality issues) and are just right for how I use them (to heat the tv viewing area and the small home office).  I am now able to turn down the thermostat to 65 or less and not suffer feeling cold in the two places I sit for long periods.  
I agree with other comments that the heat is pleasantly like that from the sun.  I appreciate the silent, gentle heat, good up to about 6 feet away on the high setting.  It seems like a well-designed unit with thoughtful touches like a holster that clips on the side of the heater to hold the remote (which works well).
For considerably less money than what I would have paid at Costco for their similar parabolic heater, I have a comparable unit without the waste of a night-light (what's that all about?).  It is also powered by a metal coil, not the quartz or other mineral lights that cause complaints about being too bright.

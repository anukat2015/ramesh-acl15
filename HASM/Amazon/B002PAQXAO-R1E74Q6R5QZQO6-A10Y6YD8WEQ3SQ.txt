Title: Nice Laptop but the touchpad is terrible
Content:
I've had this laptop for about 3 weeks and have been fiddling with the touchpad sensitivity and trying to get up the learning curve for using it.  My research tells me that it is an older hardware version than what the touchpad manufacturer now offers.  Looks like ASUS cheaped out on this. Either that or it's a technical battle with ASUS and their customers as the losers.
Bottom line, it's disappointing and just doesn't work like it should. It takes away from the overall experience and ASUS should have their heads examined for making this offering.

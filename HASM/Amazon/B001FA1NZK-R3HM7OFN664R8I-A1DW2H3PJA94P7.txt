Title: So Cool!
Content:
Bought it for my daughter and she went nuts!  She loves it.  Uses it for internet (wifi), music, and a bunch of other stuff that is so beyond me.  Basically, this is an iPhone without the phone (and the accompanying bill).  She loves it and I can see products like this being used to replace the laptop.  The only real drawback is the keyboard is not "big finger" friendly.

Title: not your mother's electrolux
Content:
I have had this vacuum about one year. It has literally fallen apart. The hose connection (the little prongs that fit together) has snapped off, so the beater head doesn't work. It has poor suction. The pile height adjustment is difficult to step through, and never seemingly the correct height for bare floors or carpet. If you have it adjusted incorrectly at all it will not pick up anything. You have to be sure to cut off the beater head motor before going to bare floors or it shoots particals out the back and across the floor. It also has an uncomfortable handle, it kind of seperates and is very irritating to hold. 
I have tried to order a new part for the electrical connector and cannot find anyone who understands what I am talking about. I ordered a couple connectors on line based on a very cryptic outline of the machine, and none that arrive were the correct ones. I am looking for another brand now. I am tired of fooling around with it. I like cannisters for stair cleaning and bare floor to carpet transistions. I hear Kenmore is good.  Anyone know about them?

Title: Fantastic little quickie-heater
Content:
I received this handy little heater in an old bag of travel accessories.  It is basically a heating coil that you put right in your mug.  My father-in-law tells me that they used to be a standard feature in many hotel rooms before microwaves.  
In the wrong hands they could be a fire hazard, but if you are an ADULT who can handle unplugging it and placing it on a heatproof surface until it cools, you'll be as impressed with its simplicity as I am.

Title: don't buy this air conditioner
Content:
It does cool ok (not the greatest) but takes a lot of energy.  The vent hose gets extremly warm.  The water drips into its tank and the sound of the dripping is like a faucet dripping, very annoying.  Tank has to be emptied every hour if you don't want to hear the dripping.

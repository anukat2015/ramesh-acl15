Title: Classic Perculator
Content:
We've had our Farberware/Salton Fastbrew Perculator (FCP280) for about 6mo now and have been very happy with it.  The biggest plus, aside from the flavor, has been the 7-9min brewing time--almost the same as an autodrip.
Construction is fairly rugged; all stainless except for the handle and whatnot, which appear to be made from some sort of bakelight or phenolic material. Cord is a detachable, two-prong appliance type, and about 18" in length.
 
The water markings (graduations) are stamped inside the pot and a bit hard to see when filling, and in fact are a bit off.  At the eight cup mark, it is actually only holding about 7 cups and some change.
I began by using the pot with pre-ground coffee, but have since switched over to grinding my own, 'perk' coffee is apparently much coarser than auto-drip, and as such has less of a tendency to clog the filter basket.
Only issues we've had--1. There is no brewing adjustment as found on some other higher priced units. This means you need to wait for the pot to cool off first (or flush w/cool water) if you want to make successive batches, and you may also have to use a scoop or two MORE of coffee than normal to compensate for the fixed brewing time. 2. We've begun having some brewing issues with the unit, sometimes ending up with a pot of 'tea'-like coffee that has to be dumped. We presently have a call into Farberware regarding this--
Other than that I would definitely recommend the product.  Seems very well made and efficient, and cleans up well.

Title: Best cup of coffee!!
Content:
When I found out that my 8 cup machine from Starbucks was being recalled I was kinda sad. After reviewing the machine that they were offering as a replacement I decided to look else ware. I was worried about buying the Capresso machine because of the overspilling issue that many write about. I have to say, its not to hard to line the top of the craft up so that it will not overspill. Don't worry about this, it is not an issue unless you are completely clueless. This machine is very nice, the coffee has to be some of the best coffee brewed! It is a great machine with looks and brew power!! Bottom line: Get it!

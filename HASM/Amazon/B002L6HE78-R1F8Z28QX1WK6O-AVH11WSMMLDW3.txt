Title: Night Time Video Quality
Content:
Length:: 1:28 MinsThis should give you guys a pretty good idea of the night-time video quality of the 5th Generation iPod nano. The quality isn't great, but it is really handy when you don't have a dedicated camera on hand. 
Another note is that conversion into a file format that Amazon accepts also degraded the quality slightly. Amazon does NOT accept the MP4 format that iPod nano records in.

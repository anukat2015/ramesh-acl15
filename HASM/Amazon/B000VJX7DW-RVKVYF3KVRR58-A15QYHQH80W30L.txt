Title: Excellent!
Content:
I own a D200 and I loved it....now I have a D300 and I can't believe Nikon can still make improvements on an already excellent D200...This camera is very very nice....in short, it makes beautiful captures easier than the previous nikon models....it's just exemplary! Go grab on and you won't miss a beat!

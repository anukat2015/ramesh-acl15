Title: Stopped working after 6 months
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker/espresso machine for some of the same reasons as everyone else.  Liked the idea of saving counterspace.  Well, the first thing that I noticed is that the (steamed) milk never really did get very hot like a purchased latte.  Secondly, after 5-1/2 months, I noticed a little light stayed on near the on switch for making coffee which I didn't think was a big deal until I found the coffee side of the machine's plate was hot and no matter what I pushed, the light wouldn't go off.  So, I thought, no big deal I'll just unplug it. Well, then my clock was flashing everytime I went to make coffee and finally returned it for the $$ and looking for another brand.  Sorry, don't trust the brand anymore.  By the way, Costco was great and said they'd had quite a few returned which means others had bad experiences also.

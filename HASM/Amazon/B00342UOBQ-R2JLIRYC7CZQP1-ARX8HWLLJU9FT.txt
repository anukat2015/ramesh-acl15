Title: Had problems with WiFi
Content:
I am going to cut right to the main point. The WiFi on this laptop wouldn't stay connected. In one hour, it might go out 10 times. I returned the first one I got to Amazon and got a replacement of the same model. I had the exact same problem with both. Didn't matter if I was three feet from the WiFi router or across the house. Same issue all the time. If it wasn't for that, I would have kept the laptop. If you don't need WiFi, this might be be a fine choice, but in my opinion WiFi is crucial in a laptop. That's why I only gave it a two. This would get a four if not for the issue. Finally returned this and bought an HP - zero problems.
Pros:
I love the look of this laptop.
It has a beautiful LCD
I like the case design
Four USBs and HDMI
Lots of RAM and storage
Cons:
Couldn't get the laptop to stay connected via WiFi (both units had same problem)
Numpad makes it harder to hit the correct keys

Title: A Pleasant Surprise!
Content:
I admit to being a Gateway fan and have bought only Gateway computers since 1986. But, when I ordered this computer, I was having second thoughts because I was thinking the chip wouldn't be fast enough and 2 Gigs of DDR2 memory wouldn't be sufficient to run multi-media software.  But the computer arrived quickly and after initial setup I discovered that everything works smoothly and effectively on this little gem. However, I find the flat keyboard keys a little disconserting.  This will take some time getting used to.
   
I am delighted and intend to use this little (but not too little) laptop extensively, especially when I travel.

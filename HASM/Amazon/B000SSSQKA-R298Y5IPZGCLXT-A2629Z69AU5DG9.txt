Title: Head attachment gets clogged right away
Content:
I bought this canister vacuum after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon. The suction isn't bad, but the head attachment gets clogged almost immediately. It's way too complicated and a pain to clean out---and it's useless cleaning it out because it gets clogged in five seconds anyway. We end up using the crevice attachment instead, but cleaning an entire house with a crevice attachment is time-consuming. I'm currently looking for a different head attachment that I can adapt to this Panasonic model.

Title: This is a good basic coffeemaker.
Content:
As we drove away from home, I was always asking my wife if she remembered to turn off our old Mr. Coffee.  Our new Black and Decker removed that worry, its 2 hour shut off was worth the price alone.  It makes great coffee, and is hotter than our old one.  The program features are simple, and easy to remember, so our coffee is ready when we get up.  I like the tall glass pot, it does not spill when you pour.  You will need to buy the paper filters, our old Mr. Coffee had a strainer basket, but its no big deal, I think the paper filter makes the coffee taste better anyway.  Most of the coffeemakers today have all the fancy gadgets on them which we didn't need.  This is a good basic coffeemaker, and the price was lower than Wal-Mart.  We even got in on the free shipping special, life is good.

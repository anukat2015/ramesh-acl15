Title: Love this
Content:
I live in a large apartment with central air.  My heating costs were so high last year, that I turned it down to just low enuf to keep the pipes warm and purchased this unit for my bedroom.  First, I like that it's on wheels so I can move it if I wish to.  I like the different temperature settings.  Even on a low setting, this baby cranks it out.  I feel safer with this type of unit than with the kind where you can see the red heating elements in the front. It's also sturdy enough that my cat and two small dogs can't knock it over, but it's lightweight enough that I can move it easily.  My only complaint?  Wish I could find a way to get a second one into my bathroom...boy it gets cold in there!  Oh, and it's completely quiet too.

Title: 6th is a charm
Content:
The Creative Zen is my 6th MP3 player.  The first 4 died for various reasons.   The last one, Creative Zen Vision:M, still works.  I replaced it because, while I like it, I have some complaints (too heavy, confusing interface, short battery life, etc.).  What I liked best about it was that it worked with Rhapsody, played videos, and it could take a beating and continue to work.  The subscription service through Rhapsody is a thing of beauty, I don't know why anyone would use a Zune or an IPod and not have that feature.  I bought the Zen 16GB flash player to address the few complaints I had with my Vision:M.  My first player came DOA.  Amazon overnighted a free replacement (I am an Amazon customer for life).  Here are my Pros and Cons on the Creative Zen 16GB.
Pros
* Works well with playforsure subscription service
* Works with Amazon Unbox
* Great sound 
* Videos look/sound good
* Very light and compact
* Improved interface from Vision:M
* Can delete items on the player
* Good trouble-shooting tools (for firmware, reboot issues)
* SD slot
* Plugs in directly to a USB 2.0 cable (no goofy adapter needed)
* Works with Vista
Cons
* buggy:  The first thing a new buyer should do is load the new firmware.  I didn't, so I was able to enjoy loading all my music and videos twice.  Fortunately there are good trouble shooting tools
* Creative Tech support:  Good luck finding a number to call
* Headphones are only OK
* Not Bluetooth enabled
* Doesn't come in Green (don't ask)
* Can't record direct to MP3
Overall a great little device that I'm using all the time

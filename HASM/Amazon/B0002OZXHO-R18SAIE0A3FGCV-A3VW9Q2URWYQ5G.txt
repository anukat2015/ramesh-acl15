Title: Piece of Crap!
Content:
I will NEVER buy another product from Apple ever again. IPODs are great if they WORK, but if you have the slightest problems with this thing (particularly the display), Apple WILL NOT cover it. My son's IPOD lasted a whole three weeks before the display went out. He loved his IPOD and had taken good care of it. He carried it in a cushioned sports holder to prevent damage. Suddenly the screen started acting funny. There was what looked like an ink blotch in the center, and only half the screen worked. 
Apple's initial response was good. They said the problem was covered and they'd take care of it, free of charge. I followed their instructions, jumped through all their hoops and sent it in for repairs. A few days later, it was returned to me, UNFIXED. They said the damage was NOT covered under their so called "Apple Care Protection Plan". I called customer service, and they told me that the problem is UNFIXABLE. 
So now I have a very expensive PAPERWEIGHT!!! It's ridiculous to charge so much for something so fragile. This thing is supposed to be portable, convenient and fun. It is when it's working- but this damaged was sustained in normal, everyday use. 
I will be contacting their corporate office on Monday when they open. The only other recourse I have is the 3-year performance plan I bought with it at Best Buy (though it looks like that was a waste- the fine print says they don't cover LCD/display problems!) or the consumer protection VISA offers on purchases made on their cards. 
What a mess! And all because I wanted to give my son something nice on his 15th birthday! I'd rate the IPOD a big fat ZERO if Amazon had such a rating!

Title: Horrible waste of money
Content:
This thing is a waste of money. The instructions are lacking a lot of information. It only blows luke warm air. Doesn't cool a room at all. Total waste of time and cash. You would be better off buying a standard fan for $30 at Walmart like we ended up doing. This thing is a joke. And the cost of shipping it back is around $70.

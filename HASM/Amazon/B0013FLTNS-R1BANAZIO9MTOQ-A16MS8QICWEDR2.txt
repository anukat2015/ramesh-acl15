Title: pretty but...
Content:
good computer but for this price should not have problems like warped lid, dvd's constantly sticking in the ridiculous slot drive with no way to extract them other than a visit to the apple store.
i regret that the form is more important than useability to mr jobs as i am on my 3rd trip to the apple store (minimum waste of 2 hours) this time to get a dvd removed from the poorly designed slot....
complete waste of my time just because stevey didnt like the look of the little manual eject hole in the front.
not a happy camper!!!!!

Title: Great product
Content:
The Lasko 754200 heater works great.  I use it to heat my Popup camper when we camp.  While camping this winter we had to use it when the temperature dropped into the low 40's at night.  We started off with the high and low setting on high and during the night I had to set it to low because it was to hot.

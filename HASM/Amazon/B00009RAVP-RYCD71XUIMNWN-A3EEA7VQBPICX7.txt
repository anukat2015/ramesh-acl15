Title: Great Heater
Content:
I love this heater. It is like having your own person sunshine. Seriously it feels like you are in the sun. It is pretty bright. That is my wife's biggest complaint with it. On low it is about like having a 40W light bulb on and on high at least a 60W bulb on. It does not look that bright in the picture but it is. I still love it though.

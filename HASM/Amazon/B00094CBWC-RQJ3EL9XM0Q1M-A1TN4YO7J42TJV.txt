Title: Quiet, and does not give me a headache
Content:
This heater can be set on high to heat a space quickly and then turned to low -- in which case you almost don't hear it (don't forget it though, because you will need to turn it off and unplug it for safety's sake). It also does not emit any fumes like so many other space heaters do -- I never get a headache when I use it!

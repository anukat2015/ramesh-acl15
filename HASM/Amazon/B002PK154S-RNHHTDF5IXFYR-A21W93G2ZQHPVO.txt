Not sure where some of the comments are coming about bad quality and service, this is by far the best rated company for quality in the PC business right now.  I have had absolutely no problems with my Ideapad.  My brother's ideapad had a issue where the hard drive was making a grinding noise.  He called service, got right through to someone, they sent him a box to mail the computer in and he got it back working perfectly 3 days later.  I definitely recommend this product and even more highly recommend the company for positive computing experience.

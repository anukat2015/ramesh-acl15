Title: Taste Great and Stays Hot
Content:
I have used various brands of "Thermo" coffee makers for years with satisfactory results but this Bunn product outperforms them all.  I read a number of reviews on this product, prior to purchase, complaining that the coffee and grinds overflow.  When I used bottled water during my initial use this also happened to me.  However, as soon as I switched to tap water the problem disappeared resulting in the best tasting hot coffee I have ever expierenced.  Use only Bunn filters and avoid soft water with a passion.

Title: good heat -- could use better thermostat
Content:
The radiator works well and heats our room nicely and evenly.  The settings on the radiator are thermostat controlled (the setting corresponds to the room's air temperature, not to the radiator's heat output).  That's great -- but what's missing is an indication of what temperature the settings actually correspond to (it just has numbers from 1-6).  For instance, it has this "ComforTemp" setting which is supposed to automatically set the "right" temperature for you.  But it gives no indication (on the unit or in the manual) what that "right" temperature actually is.  I'm using it to heat my baby's room at night to keep it a bit warmer than the rest of the house -- and so it is important to know approximately what temperature it is set to so she doesn't get too hot or too cold.  With trial and error, I have been able to determine the correct settings, but it could have been made easier.

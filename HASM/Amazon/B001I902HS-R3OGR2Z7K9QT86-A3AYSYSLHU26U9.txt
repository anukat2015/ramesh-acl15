Title: DO I LOVE THIS VAC - YES and NO
Content:
The Panasonic MC-CG885 canister vacuum cleaner has a lot going for it.  There are some things I'm not fond of.  Here is my list of Pros and Cons.
 
PROS:
*Vacuum took all of less than 5 minutes to assemble.
*The on the handle height adjustment for carpets is super easy and works great.
*Power cord retracts easy.  Not too fast and not too slow.  Hasn't had a problem with it at all.
*The way the hose swivels is convenient and saves many steps.  I don't have to turn the vacuum cleaner to change my direction.
*Light on the head while doing carpet is a nice feature.
*Storage of the 2 attachments in the compartment is great.
*Love the fact that when I am done using the vacuum cleaner I can stand it upright and it has a little slot for the wand and vacuum head to slide into so it makes it easy to store.  I don't have much storage space and I can store this vac.  Doesn't take up much space at all.
*The bag is easy to place into the vacuum and has been performing just fine.  On other canisters I have had the vacuum decrease suction due to the bag not expanding properly.  This one does an excellent job.
*The HEPA filter is nice.  I did a test and dusted a room before I vacuumed that room.  I came back an hour after vacuuming to see how much dust the vacuum produced and left on my freshly dusted furniture and I found none.  That was a huge Plus!
*It was easy to vacuum the stairs without having to lug the entire vacuum up each stair as I found the length of the cord to be just fine for me.
*While vacuuming the carpet I noticed items from the floor jumping up and being sucked into the vac head.  I was surprised at the power.
*I have also had great success with using this vacuum on my hardwood floors.  Keep in mind that all hardwood floors are not the same.  Mine are solid oak and do have a small space between the boards.  The vacuum has removed items from those spaces and all of the floors.
*Dog hair has been able to be removed from both the carpets and the floors.
*Not too heavy.  I can carry it up and down stairs with ease.
*Very  quiet.  I can't hear it all over the house like other vacuums.  Even the dog doesn't run and hide.
 
CONS:
*Dusting Brush:  A little bitty thing.  I think it should have been bigger.
*Dust Bags:  Very difficult to find and overpriced.  As this is a new vacuum to the market (and the bags are new too) I am sure that it will not be very long before finding bags and the cost of them is no longer an issue.
*Floor Tool:  There is no floor tool.  It is built into the main head.  The main head it too big to get under furniture to get out the dust bunnies and whatever else has landed underneath.  I did solve this problem by purchasing a separate Floor Brush that is available.
*Handle Release Lever:  This releases the wand from the Power Nozzle head.  I am skeptical  of this.  It is a thin piece of plastic that you use your foot to push down to release.  I am wondering how long this will last before it breaks.  Hopefully it will never break.
 
OVERALL:
I love this vacuum with its power and convenience.

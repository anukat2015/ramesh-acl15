Title: coffee never hot
Content:
The coffee made in this coffee maker was never hot.  It was warm, at best, and did not stay that way for long.  We did all the steps in the instructions to create the maximum hot tempurature, but it was still not hot coffee.  I liked the design of the two commuter mugs, the ability to create one or two cups and the ability to make two different kinds of coffee, so we were very disappointed that the coffee was never hot.  This could have been the perfect coffee maker for us.

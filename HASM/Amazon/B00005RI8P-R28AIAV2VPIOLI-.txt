Title: Poor Product Quality and Support
Content:
I bought this iBook model a few weeks ago at our University's Apple store. After doing alot of research and shopping, I decided to get off the PC bandwagon and go with the Apple. I felt that for the price, I was getting the best value, and I thought that this thing just looked great. I added 256megs of memory and a AirPort card. Out of the box, it was easy to setup, just a couple of steps, and I was off and running in no time. MacOS X is very nice, although it does not have alot of programs made for it yet. The problem started the day after I bought it, as I was typing a paper, the display went compleatly white. I tried restarting the computer, same thing. I reset the computer, same thing. I called Apple's support number, and a recorded message told me that unless you paid for a service plan, you did not ger 24 hr support and to call back during normal business hours, our to consult their website! GREAT!! I have a paper to get done and they tell me to consult their website...on my dead computer!!!! The next morning I took it back to the store, telling them what had happened, and they determined that it needed to be repaired. I asked if I could just get an exchange and they said that Apple's policy was once you buy it, the sale is final and I would have to wait the week or two that it would take to send it in for repair! Do not by an Apple, learn from my mistake.

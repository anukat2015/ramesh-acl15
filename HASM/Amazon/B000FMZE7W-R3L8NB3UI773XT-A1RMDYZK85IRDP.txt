Title: love my zune
Content:
I opted for the Zune 30 over the Zune 80 because I'm hard on my toys and I needed something that will tolerate me occaisionally dropping it or tossing it into my purse that doubles as a briefcase and general catchall.  So far, so good.  I've been learning on the fly because I refuse to read a manual and I haven't gotten stuck yet. It seems as simple as anything else I've tried - truly plug and play with the basics. I haven't gotten onto the Zune "Social", but if it's nearly as uncomplicated as the rest, it's more than worth the price. My only caution is it comes bare bones (no headphones, sync cables, etc.) so be prepared to shell out extra or seek out a bundle when purcasing. I found a sync cable that came with a car charger/wall charger which works out for my needs just fine for now.

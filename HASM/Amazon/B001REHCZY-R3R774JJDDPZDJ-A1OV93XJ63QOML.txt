Title: Instructions
Content:
The product arrive timely but without any installation instructions or User manual.  I went online and the User manual was not available for the product.  Called the number on the box and finally spoke with a person who emailed the Manual.  Had to figure out the installation for myself.  The screws and spacers were in the box. A simple project was a challenge.

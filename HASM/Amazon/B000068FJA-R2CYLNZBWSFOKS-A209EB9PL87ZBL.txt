Title: FIRE HAZARD, look out!
Content:
We got this heater to replace a very old one, to heat our 12'x12' living room.  Nothing too extreme.  Used it according to directions and all.
It does a good job heating!  That much I can say.  The double-angled heating feature is nice too.
But it is LOUD.  I mean LOUD, to the point of being distracting while having a conversation or watching the teevee.
The loudness was tolerable for our needs, but the shoddy electrical workmanship is what ruined this heater for me.  After we owned it for about a month I noticed a strange fishy-plastic smell, and found that it literally melted the wall electrical socket it was plugged into.  The plastic around the plug's prong was brown and melty too.
Fortunately this thing didn't burn my house down.  Hopefully it doesn't burn yours down, either!!

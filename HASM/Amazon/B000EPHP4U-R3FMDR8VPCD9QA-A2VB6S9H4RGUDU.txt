Title: Iove it
Content:
I will keep it short.  I never wanted to be one of "those guys" carrying an ipod at the airport (you know who you are).  When the 8 gig nano came out I took the leap.  I have yet to find a good armband (the one I have does the trick, but not perfectly).  All in, this has been a great little product for working out, driving with, and for use on the plane.  If you want one, get one!

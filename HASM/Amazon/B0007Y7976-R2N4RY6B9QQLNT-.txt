Title: Great product...wished i would have gotten zen vision.
Content:
This is a great iPod! I returned my Sony Bean for the iPod and i payed 100 dollars for it. This was a great decision, but the disadvantage to nano iPods is you can't download games or movies! I was really disappointed...well I knew anyways. You have to buy the A.C. adapter, which I was very PISSED because of this. iTunes is expensive the lady at best buy said you can only buy the songs and not burn them off a c.d. which...is a lie! I wish I would have gotten Zen Vision. I love my iPod though...haha im funny.No, don't  get me wrong I love my iPod.

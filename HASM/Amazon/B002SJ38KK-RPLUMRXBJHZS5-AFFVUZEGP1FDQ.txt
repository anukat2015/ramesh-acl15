Title: Great for the price
Content:
This is a great options for those who want a small laptop but don't necessarily want to be restricted by a netbook. This Acer has an 11.6 inch HD display that looks amazing. Pictures look pristine and full of detail with this monitor display. The Acer is extremely portable since it is super light.
It has an Intel Celeron processor and long battery life. The keyboard took some getting used too, even though my previous laptop was a 12 inch Dell Inspiron. When I want to hit 'enter' I kept hitting the '\' key. My big gripe with this laptop is the mouse/touch pad. Although the multiple touch feature is helpful, the touch pad is 1. not as sensitive, or 2. as big as I would like it to be. They could have made the touch pad a bit bigger, at least expanding it sideways. As it is, I find it a bit uncomfortable.
This is a great option for a laptop and you just can't beat the price. Get this instead of a netbook.

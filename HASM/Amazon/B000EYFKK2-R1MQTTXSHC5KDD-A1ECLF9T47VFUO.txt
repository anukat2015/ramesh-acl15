Title: great value
Content:
This little bad boy is a great buy for the money. It's a little louder than an equal BTU window unit, but it's portability and cooling output is worth a little noise. It is not made for a big room, so I have it in my sons 15' X 25' bedroom and it keeps it ice cold if needed.

Title: Good So Far
Content:
Just received the BCO70 as a gift.  Made very good coffee and espresso.  Over all, very happy.  The manual dosen't describe what the pop-off lid is on the right side.  (To the right of the espresso "accuflavor" switch).  What is it for?  (Milk)?  A message to DeLonghi's internet site has yet to receive a response.  Have read the review's here (all very helpful) and now will need to be very careful with the fliter holder.  Did seem to be a potential breakage problem area to me.  Grind my own coffee and putting the ground coffee into the filters (whether regular or espresso) is messy.

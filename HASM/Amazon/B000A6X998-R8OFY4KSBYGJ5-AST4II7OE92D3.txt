Title: Heater Review
Content:
This is a good product, heats the room completely. Its a little noisey, if you like it really quiet when sleeping, it can take a little getting use to but it does drown out the noise of barking dogs. The electronic theromstat works great, keeps my room at an even temperature, I've actually had to turn it down a couple of times or off in the middle of the night because I was too hot. Its bright, lights up the whole room when its on. I'd recommend it, works much better than any other portable heater I've tried. It did trip my power a couple of times and it automatically shuts itself off which is a nice feature.

Title: Wall Hanging Adapter
Content:
When you buy the Shark make sure you purchase the wall hanging unit or you will only frustrate yourself. I don't know why it is not included as a part of the standard product or at least mark the box and order form to indicate it is not included.Shipping and handling was more than the adapter.  GRRRR!

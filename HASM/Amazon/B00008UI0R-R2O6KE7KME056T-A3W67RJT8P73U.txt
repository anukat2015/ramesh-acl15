Title: A great buy
Content:
It arrived a few days ago.  This is one heck of a vacuum.  I am absolutely thrilled.  It is better than I expected.  Very easy to: maneuver, use the attachments, empty the canister (no bags), store, etc.  The suction is incredible and will pick up even the most stubborn pet hair.  Having the controls on the handle makes it that much easier to increase and decrease the power and switch from hard floor mode to carpet mode.  All in all this is well worth the money.  I have purchased nearly every make and model of vacuum including Oreck, Dyson, Eureka, etc.  This is far and away the best one and I hope it continues to work just as well for many years to come.  If you are thinking about it, go ahead and buy it.  Don't forget to get the $25 off that Amazon offers if you spend $125.

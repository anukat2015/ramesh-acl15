Title: good product
Content:
I purchased the iPod Nano about 4 months ago and have been very pleased with it. If you have the money, I definately recommend the Nano. I also strongly recommend getting the 2-year replacement plan with it for two reasons...
1. The battery will typically only hold a charge for 12-18 months. It costs something like $80 to replace the battery. Paying the additional $25 is worth it in the long run.(I have a sister that works at BestBuy who advised me of this)
2. My nano quit working after about 3 months. Because I had the replacement plan, I was able to have it replaced for free. I have heard that Nanos will often times do this, so its better to be on the safe side, especially when spending that amount of money.

Title: Style Over Substance!!!!
Content:
Apple has proved once again that people will buy things if they come in pretty colors!!  Like their successful original imacs, which came in a plethora of colors and sold through the roof, the ipod mini is doing the same.  Let's put it this way; you'll buy the ipod mini if you're trying to make a fashion statement and show hip you are, but aren't really serious about music.  No serious music fan would be satisfied with a device that only holds 1000 songs, when they could buy the 20GB ipod for only $50 more, and have 4000 more songs!!!  Do they still teach economics in school?

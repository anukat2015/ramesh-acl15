Title: Not the 3rd generation, the current generation, but still good
Content:
For all those on the fence out there - waiting for a new iPod Touch with a camera or buy the newest ones just released, I love my new 64GB Touch. It is faster than the older 2nd generation Touch, and the Voice Control features works in my car to control the music, hooked up to a cable connect and the headphones at the same time.
I give it 5 stars because it is what I wanted - an iPod Touch large enough to hold my 40gb of music, with Voice control in the car so I can control it hands free. I don't need a video camera - I have a video camera. I don't need a still camera - my cell phone does this. I don't need VOIP, my cell phone works just fine. And I don't need GPS, I like the current one I have. I would love those features - trust me, I had a tiny bit of envy when the Nano came out with a camera and the touch didn't (please tell me I wasn't the only one to get that pun).. But I don't love those feature enough to wait for them, or enough to terminate my contract with Verizon and just get an iPhone.
BUT - this might be important for those on the fence. No matter what Amazon calls it, or even CNET reviews, this is not the 3rd generation iPod Touch. Apple is calling it the "current generation" or the "newest generation", only to eventually call it the 2nd generation. Even Apple did not think it was enough of an upgrade to give it a new generation. I can't speak to the rumors about what this means for when the 3rd generation is coming out - because we all know how true rumors about the iPod Touch have been lately.

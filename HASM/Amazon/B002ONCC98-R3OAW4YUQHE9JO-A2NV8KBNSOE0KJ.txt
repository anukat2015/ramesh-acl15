Title: HP G71-340US
Content:
This has been a great laptop. It has all the right spec for a desktop replacement or small business machine. I do not have any issues with this laptop. The screen is nice and bright even in the daylight. The Stock build wasnt to heavy with HP software either. It works really well with windows 7. Well worth the buy!!!!

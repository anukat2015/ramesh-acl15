Title: Great looking and great coffee w/ FATAL FLAW
Content:
GOOD - like all others, fast, hot, great tasting coffee and good looking.
BAD - Minor issues but one BIG ONE.  Some people mention overflowing etc, and the other day, I filled it, to aprox 1/4" above the 10 cup mark. I figured that should not be a problem.  Well I was wrong.  It overflowed, and got into the control and display board and shorted the entire unit out.  AMAZING, you spill coffee at the base, one time and the thing is fried.  It is as if NO ONE AT CAPRESSO could imagine that someone might spill water or coffee on the control panel which is right next to the carafe at the base.
I called capresso and they agreed to fix it but that is because i have only had it for 3 months.  what about next year.  My prior Cuisinart cheapo has been used and abused for 7 years with no isssues.
I will give this thing one more chance, because i generally like it, but in many ways, you get the sense this should be a "beta" version, and when the come out with the production version, the bugs would be worked out.
Maybe they skipped the testing period where they actually use the item in their own lives, BEFORE selling them to us! 
*** UPDATE  ***  long overdue - after getting a return authorization (promptly from capresso) i tried the unit and voila, it worked - and has since with no problems.
I still think it is lame that if the pot overflows, the controls get soaked and it craps out - but it did dry out and has worked flawlessly ever since.
i will now raise it to 5 stars minus one for this issue = 4.
it does make great coffee!

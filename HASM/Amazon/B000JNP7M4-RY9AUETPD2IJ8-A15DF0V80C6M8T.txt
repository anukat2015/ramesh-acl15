Title: A Great office heater
Content:
It's FREEZING where I work (high rise, NYC office building) -- winter and summer it's a meat locker.  I went through multiple space heaters but was continually tripping the circuit breaker in my office building (and getting nastier and nastier memos from office services and building management).  Needless to say there is more than one of us that have space heaters on the same circuit!  
I had to try something else and started doing research and stumbled upon this heater -- other reviewers said it was the perfect under desk heater and did not trip the breakers.  They were right!  It fits easily under the desk and because of its flat profile, it tucks out of the way (just in case you need to hide it!).  It makes no noise (also in case you need to hide it from snoopy building management people...). Unlike a space heater it doesn't blast out super heated air, then switch off until you're cold ... then blast out super heated air again.  This just gives off a nice radiant glow.  If you should happen to touch it, you won't burn yourself either. Best of all, I haven't tripped the circuit breaker after using it every day during a very, very cold sub-freezing month outside (and constant below-70 degrees inside this office building).  Don't hesitate to buy this heater for an office - you'll be warm and no one will ever know!

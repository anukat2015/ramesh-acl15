Title: Fantastic!
Content:
I had read the other reviews for the refurbished Electrolux and knew I was going to get it, I just hoped that the manuals would come too, and they did! SO! What we did was vacuum with our neighbors hyper-expensive Dyson and then unpack this puppy and vacuum right behind the Dyson. It picked up cat hair and who knows what else that the other machine missed, and then we happily switched over to the provided upholstery tool to do our couch and office chair, and voila! More uglies captured. Somehow it was very satisfying to see the accumulation in the see-through tank. And it's so quiet it didn't scare the cats! Highly, highly recommended!

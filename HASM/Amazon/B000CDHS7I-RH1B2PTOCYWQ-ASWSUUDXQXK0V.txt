Title: Plastic Taste Awful
Content:
Do not buy this coffee maker.  As others have commented (I wish I had read their reviews before buying) the coffee tastes of plastic.  There is nothing I can do.  I have been cleaning it, running vinegar through, etc.  Nothing works.   I went back to my old Braun and it makes a great cup.  Avoid this product.

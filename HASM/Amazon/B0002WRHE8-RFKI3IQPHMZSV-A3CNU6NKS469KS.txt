Title: Real comfort
Content:
Since I tent-camp year-round I needed a safer way to provide heat in my tent in cold weather. I had been using one of those tank-mounted radiant propane heaters, which did the job but it took up a lot of room and was very dangerous.
I had an occasion to try the Mr Heater single burner heater and liked it but I opted for the Big Buddy because I have a 10x10 tent and when it is 20° or less outside you need more heat than the single burner provides.
I am very happy with the Big Buddy and the three heat settings, fan and two propane canister receptacles. The only con I have is that they make you pay extra to get the power adapter to run the fan instead of using 4 "D" batteries.

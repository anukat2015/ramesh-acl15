Title: Sounds better than it is
Content:
I love the concept of this little coffee maker.  It is convenient and quick, perfect for my needs.  The problem is the mess it creates.  The water is distributed so fast and hard it spills the coffee grounds over the sides of the filter.  After every use I not only have to wash out the permanent filter (no big deal), but also the water reservoir and setion which holds the filter and basket.  This product flaw makes &quot;convenience&quot; a misnomer.  My husband has a one-cup Mr. Coffee in his office and although it is slower to brew, there is no mess.

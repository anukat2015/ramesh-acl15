Title: DeLonghi HHP1500 Mica Panel Radiator
Content:
Like how heater fits up to wall, and can be hung if desired. However, it does not emit the heat anticipated.  Being on wheels, it is easy to move and reposition compared to long baseboard-type models. I have it in a relatively small room (about 12x12) and it makes only a modicum of difference in comfort.  The room is used as an office so I only have it on when I'm in there (1-2 hrs. at most).  Perhaps if left on for a longer period of time, the results would be more appreciable.

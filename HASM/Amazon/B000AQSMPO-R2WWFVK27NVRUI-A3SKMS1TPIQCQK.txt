Title: Great machine, not so great coffee
Content:
The B60 is a well designed and constructed single cup coffee maker that makes mediocre tasting coffee.  Buy the Tassimo if you want full-bodied, great tasting single cup coffee (and cappuccino!).  Only consider the Keurig if you like your coffee to be weak "diner" variety coffee.
The B60 is probably the most quiet, well-constructed single cup coffee maker on the market.  I have owned one for over a year and have had no problems with it.  I have used at least six or seven varieties of coffee in the machine but have never been satisfied with the coffee taste.
I recently went to a bed and breakfast that had a Braun Tassimo and immediately went out and bought one to replace my Keurig B60!  The Tassimo is cheaply made, takes longer to brew, can't use large coffee mugs, and is somewhat noisier than the Keurig. The Tassimo makes much better tasting coffee and I'm willing to suffer its shortcomings for good coffee.

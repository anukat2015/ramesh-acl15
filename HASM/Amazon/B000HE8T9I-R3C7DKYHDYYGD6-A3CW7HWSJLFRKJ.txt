Title: DO NOT BUY
Content:
1. Poor Construction, Telescoping Wand does not attach well.  
2. When carrying by the "Carry Handle" The canister sometimes releases from the vacuum, due to poor manufacturing.
3. Do not Clean cyclonic chamber with water as described on pages 7 and 8 of the manual.  Water can get trapped just below the rubber seal and not dry out for over 4 days.  This makes the vacuum useless and dangerous.
4. Customer service is poor.  No response after 4 days. Called and was told to by a new cyclonic chamber ($45), have owned for 4.5 months.  Warranty only covers the motor.
Don't waste your money.

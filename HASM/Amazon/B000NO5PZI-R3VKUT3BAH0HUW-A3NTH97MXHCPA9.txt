Title: Works great for a short while then breaks
Content:
I bought my Bissell Momentum in 2007, it broke September 2009. The motor was overheating and the vacuum started sounding like a airraid siren. Even before it broke it had many signs of cheap build quality. The handle would split at the seams, bin did not fit tight and so would spill dust out etc. It does a good job picking up dirt though, it's just disappointing that it broke so quickly. It is sitting outside on the curb waiting to get picked up by tomorrow's trash pickup.

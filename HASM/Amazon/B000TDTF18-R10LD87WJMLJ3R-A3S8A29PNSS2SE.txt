Title: coffee pot - a success
Content:
I wanted a full size coffee pot, but felt they all took up too much space on the counter.  Finally saw this one and decided to try tucking it in a corner, out of the way,
and using the convenient pull out coffee and water fill. It works for me!  It makes a good 5 cups of coffee which fills 2 mugs with a little left for warm ups, which we use every day.  I still have the option of 12 cups when family or company are here.
   The "aroma drip" seems to take a little longer, but I use it unless I am in a hurry.
I like the coffee pot!

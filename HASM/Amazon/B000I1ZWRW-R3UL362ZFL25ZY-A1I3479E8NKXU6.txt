Title: WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER
Content:
I had a Rebel G with no problems for over a decade-never had a problem and did not consider another make of camera when I switched to a digital SLR-My Rebel XTi malfunctioned after only 8 months, and of course there were excuses as to why the warranty did not cover -BUYER BEWARE

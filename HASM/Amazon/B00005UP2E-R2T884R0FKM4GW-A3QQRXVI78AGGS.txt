Title: Bye Bye Pet Hair and other stuff
Content:
I purchased a Dirt Devil Breeze Canister vacuum based entirely on what other pet owners and professional cleaners had to say about it. I have had it for 3 weeks and am wildly enthusiastic about it's light weight, sucking power. I have 8 cats, three of whom are Himalayan long haired lovelies.This little machine is very easy to use, has a long hose,follows well, and is easy to dump out when full. It gets into corners, underneath furniture,is great on blinds, shucks I even used it to clean cobwebs and dust off of my covered patio. So far it has exceeded my expectations.

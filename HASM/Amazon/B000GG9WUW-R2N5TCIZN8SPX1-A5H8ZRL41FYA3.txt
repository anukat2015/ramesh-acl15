Title: Not very hot
Content:
This just does not work well. Does not put out much heat and VERY loud. I bought it to put under my desk as a replacement for an older one that broke. This just doesn't put out much heat at all, and is so loud that I need to turn it off to take phone calls.  I now have to look for a better one. Very disappointed.

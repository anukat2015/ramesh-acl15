Title: OUTSTANDING!
Content:
After a decade of watching the developing digital SLR market, a month ago I stepped back into the single lens reflex world purchasing a Canon EOS 40D (I shot a T-50 in the 1980s and a EOS 650 through the 1990s).  To date, 27 days later, my wife and I have taken over 1120 shots and we have only one word to describe the 40D- OUTSTANDING!
This lightweight (about 4 lbs. with attached 28-135mm lens) SLR is phenomenal.  Its tough magnesium body houses a brilliantly arranged 10.1 mega pixels, Digic III processor, 2.5" LCD monitor, CF size card, self-cleaning sensor, terminals (for pc, video out, remote control, and digital down load), a mode set dial (that includes "basic zone", "creative zone", and 3 "custom user" settings), along with a multitude of the usual Canon SLR functions and features (1.5" LCD function panel, auto focus button, red-eye detection, access lamp, shutter priority, pop-up E-TTL auto flash with AF-assist beam, etc.).  The 40D hosts all EOS lenses, TTL and EX series "Speedlites", and is powered by the long-lasting BP-511A rechargeable battery.  
This formidable camera takes clear and brilliant photos up-close (within a few inches) and far a field (with a 300mm).  The Digic 3 is fast, allowing this SRL to take up to 5 shots in 1.5 seconds!  (I find myself taking 12-20 snaps with every pose thus presenting several choices for printing.)
The novice "photo bug" might find the EOS series complicated (with several dials and buttons).  Someday, technology will adjust the mirror for live view monitor usage with every setting (and not just in the "creative zone").  The 40D photo results override these minor details.  
The EOS 40D is vastly recommendable over all other cameras.  It is a perfect gift candidate.  Get your 40D soon and you will see- it's OUTSTANDING.

Title: Works Great!
Content:
I originally bought this while in Afghanistan to keep me warm during the -1 degree Farenheit nights.  It worked wonderfully there and I was doubly pleased when I started using it at home during the winters.  We live in an old brick home in DC and the downstairs is absolutely horrible at keeping heat in.  My gas bills would usually run me $400 for at least two months during the winter.  I broke this out when the temperature started cooling down and it had the whole first floor of my home warmed up by 2 degrees within minutes.
The only downsides are that the surface does get pretty hot and it emits a terrible smell for the first week after you initially take it out of the box and turn it on.

Title: I LOVE my Apple iPod Classic 160G Black (6th Generation) !!!!
Content:
Having been a Creative Zen Vision and Vision(M) customer, I was a little hesitant to buy an Apple iPod Classic 160GB.  I read a lot of customer reviews at various online retail sites and heard some less than positive things about this player.  I have been nothing but thrilled with this player since I opened the box!!  I LOVE the 160GB disk space.  Compared to the 30GB size of my previous Creative Zen Vision and Vision(M) it's really no comparison at all.  I have had 3 of my Creative Vision(M)s have hard drive failure since I've had them, and Creative's Customer Support is VERY POOR!  I have had NO problems with my Apple iPod Classic whatsoever.  It loads all of my music, videos and Podcasts so easily using iTunes.  The interface is so easy to use and it starts up and shuts down in a flash.  My Creative's take forever to start up compared to the iPod.  The battery life is fantastic and the sound and video quality are superb!!  I have to admit that from now on it's Apple all the way and Creative as lost a customer for good!!!  Buy it, you'll LOVE IT!!!!

Title: I just love it!
Content:
First I had an iPod shuffle just for jogging but then I decided I need an mp3-player that can store all my music. The decision for Apple was made quickly but then which version of the iPod? 
I decided to buy the iPod touch because of the internet feature and sometimes I'm too lazy to turn on my PC. 
I have it now since 2 weeks and I just love it!! Playing music on it is great, of course, but then you can have movies, e-mail and all the other stuff, millions of little useful and funny apps. Sometimes you think or talk about stuff and need to google it, the iPod touch is the perfect solution! Also it's very easy to handle and the design is elegant. 
The only maybe negative thing would be the battery, to me it seems to run empty quite quickly, but maybe I play with it too often:)
I would definetly recommend it buying it!!!
I showed it to my boyfriend and he knows a lot about that technical stuff... he was amazed and jealous... maybe because I spent more time with the iPod than with him ;)
It deserves the 5 stars completely, so go for it!!!!!!

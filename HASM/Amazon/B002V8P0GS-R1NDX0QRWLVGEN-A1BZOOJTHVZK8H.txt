Title: Once the flickering problem was solved...
Content:
thanks to the review by K. Haass who included the steps to remedy this, my Acer now seems to be functioning well.  Had it not been for this questionable start, I would have given the Acer 5534 five stars.    
I was interested in purchasing a notebook with a webcam so I could stay in touch (via Skype) with my son and his family who just moved to Virginia.  My only other needs were to check email and surf the net.  The Skype program installed seamlessly.   Once my son's webcam is set up, I'll update this review with the outcome.  7
This notebook fit my needs and then some - a big screen, a full keyboard indluding a number pad, Windows 7, a dvd player/burner.  I got a great deal at BJ's on an unopened Christmas return.  It was quite simple for a basic user to get up and running.  It'll take me awhile to become familiar with everything this little gem can do as it's my first laptop.  In the meantime, it's keeping my mind young learning the technology...

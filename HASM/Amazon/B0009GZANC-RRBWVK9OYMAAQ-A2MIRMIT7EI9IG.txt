Title: Puts the Coolpix Series to Shame
Content:
As a Coolpix user for many years, I finally upgraded to an SLR. The camera is easy to use and has many controls/features similiar to the Coolpix line. As you would expect, there is no lag time with the D50 compared to the Coolpix.  Also, the D50 battery lasts forever.
I always had to fix up my Coolpix photos with Photoshop Elements. With the D50, over 90% of the photos don't need any help from Elements. 
The final verdict was comparing prints from the Kodak Print Service. I never noticed until I got the D50, but the Coolpix 5700 photos seem almost blurry in comparison to the D50 photos. The D50 photos seem somehow much clearer. It's had to describe, but there is a significant difference between them. In addition, the D50 colors are much more vibrant than the Coolpix 5700. 
I'm glad I upgraded. I should have done this sooner.

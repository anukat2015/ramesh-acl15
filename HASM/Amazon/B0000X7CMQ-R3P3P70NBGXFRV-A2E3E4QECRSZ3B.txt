Title: Poor design
Content:
To be honest, I haven't brewed coffee in this machine so I can't comment on the quality of the coffee it makes. I'm returning it unused because the #4 filters they tell you to use don't fit. They stick out of the basket more than a quarter of an inch. When you swing the basket into place, there's a plastic feed arm that is supposed to automatically swing over the center of the filter basket. However, because the #4 filter sticks up so high, the arm can't swing over. I tried cutting the filters down and that worked better but who wants to do that every time? Also, to fill the reservoir you have to use the carafe. No big deal. Except there's a piece on the top of the carafe that has to be taken off  for the brewing process and then put back on if you want to keep the coffee warm in the carafe. This machine is way too much trouble.

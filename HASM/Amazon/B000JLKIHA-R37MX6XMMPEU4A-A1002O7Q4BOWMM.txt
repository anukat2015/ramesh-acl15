Title: Finally doing the iPod thing
Content:
Been one of those hold-outs waiting for I don't know what?  Old school music guy who still has a turn table and plays vinyl.  Well, I'm digitizing all the records and moving everything onto my new iPod with HD back-up in WAV format to burn full sound CD's.  To me it's not that the iPod is or isn't everything they say it is but what works for you.  I'm amazed at how simple and flexible the iPod is.  Have had no issues what so ever.  My library at this point is totally converted vinyl and sounds outstanding IMO.  Even after converting all the WAV files to ACC.  Takes a lot of time to fill in all the reference information and album data but if you enjoy music it's a labor of love.  Great fun taking all my old stuff where ever I go.  More to the point........reason I chose Apple was for the user interface with iTunes.  Tried organizing my music with Windows Media Player but it's way more cumbersom and just didn't do it for me.  My hats off to Apple for designing a splendid interface.  It just flat out works and doesn't take lots of time to learn.

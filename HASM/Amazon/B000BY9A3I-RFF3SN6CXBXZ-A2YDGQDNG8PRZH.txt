Title: Very Pleased
Content:
I've had the vacuum for a month now, and overall it works pretty well on all floor surfaces. My space is kind of small and there's not a lot of carpeting. I would say if you're looking for a carpet vacuum and you have a lot of space, this is not the one for you. I'm not really sure how the carpet attachment works exactly. All of my other vacuums have been central vac, and the carpet attachment is always powered through the handle. This one just sticks on the end like every other attachment and is powered by the airflow, I guess... Don't be afraid of that comment though. It actually works pretty well, and I was pleasantly surprised with how much power it had. I just don't know if i would want to vacuum a large room (anything bigger than 600 sqft) with this vacuum. Aside from that it's a great vacuum, and it has a few little extras that make vacuuming a little easier (retractible cord, one button canister release and cleaning brush in the vacuum and a rotating hose).

Title: It Just Works!
Content:
I've been a PC guy for over 15 years. I was used to having my computer get slower over time. I was used to constantly fixing problems with my machine every time Windows updated. I had just spent two hours trying to get my pc laptop to connect to the internet wirelessly. And yet I doubted Apple could have possibly made a computer that just works and doesn't degrade over time. 
Guess what? They did. Not only have I not had one single hardware problem with my Mac but better yet the software is just great! iWork is better than Microsoft office while still being compatible with office. 
Are Macs more expensive? Yes, a little. But is the software often cheaper, more reliable, and easier to use? YES!
I could go on and on, but just do yourself a favor, if your looking for a new computer. At least go out and try a Mac before you make your final decision. You might just enjoy using your computer again.

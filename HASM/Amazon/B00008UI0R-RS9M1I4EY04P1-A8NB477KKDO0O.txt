This little vacuum has amazing power, when it worked. I've only had it for one month and the attachment brush won't turn. The unit has suction and the belt is fine. It seems like it's either the motor or the power buttons. Stay tuned, I'm going to take it to Hoover to see if I can get it fixed or replaced.  This should not happen to a new product - not sure I would highly recommend it.

Title: Reaches all the corners!
Content:
I have a cat that sheds ridiculous amounts of fur near and around my computer, so this is the perfect vacuum for the job.  I can reach areas that are impossible to get to with a stand up vacuum.  The suction is great, the size is perfectly compact for a small apt, and I love the color.  I totally recommend this vacuum to people with smaller places/apts, wood floors and pets.  My only problem with the model is that it is bagless....I don't like dealing with the canister...but that is more of a preference.

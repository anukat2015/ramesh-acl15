Title: Disappointment
Content:
I was excited to try this thing out. I took it out of the box and plugged it in and it didn't work at all. Nothing happened. I called customer support and the woman said I could either cut the cord off and send it to her and they'd send me another one (but that I'd have to pay shipping) or send it back to Amazon. Amazon has a better return policy so I just sent it back for a refund and bought a coffee maker I could look at before purchasing. It just makes me upset that these companies do everything they can to *not* take responsibility for their shoddy product.

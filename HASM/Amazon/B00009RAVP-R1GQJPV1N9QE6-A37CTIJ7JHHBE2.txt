Title: Great if you want the sun in your room
Content:
This is a good heater, quiet, heats fast, spreads it around tiltable, I really like it, except it is so bright I mean REALLY REALLY BRIGHT, I had to return it, beause you can't look towards it if it is on high. It hurts your eyes and leaves light spots on your eyes. Or if you want to use it at night you might want to wear blindfolds.

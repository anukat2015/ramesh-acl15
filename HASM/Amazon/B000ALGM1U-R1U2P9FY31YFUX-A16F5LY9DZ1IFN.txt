Title: Big Bang for Small Bucks
Content:
I've installed two of these at different homes. It's easy to install and program. The four daily time settings for both the weekdays and the weekends is a big plus. The batteries should be replaced at least once a year. I do it when the time changes in the fall. All in all it's an excellent product at a low cost.

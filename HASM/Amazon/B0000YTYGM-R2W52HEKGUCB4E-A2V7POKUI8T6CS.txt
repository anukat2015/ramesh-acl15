Title: Hot Coffee Action
Content:
I bought this coffee maker based on the other reviews a few months ago, and they are right on!  This is the finest, best designed coffee maker I have had in years.  The carafe keeps the coffee much hotter than other makers...(and I have gone through at least two thermals in as many years)...I can think of no outstanding flaw.  The lid which was bad-rapped in one of the reviews is head and shoulders above some real pieces of crap I've had to suffer through, (Mr. Coffee designers, please take note!)  The reviewer complaining about the glass in the carafe breaking...perhaps there is a glass insert within the walls of the carafe, but I have found no evidence, and they must have dropped the thing.  As far as the beeping, well, I don't know why they threw that in there but it is not a deal breaker. (Why does everything have to beep these days?)  If you are a serious coffee drinker you will be very happy with this unit.

Title: Love this one
Content:
This is the replacement of my old Canon 10D. Compare to 10D, there are several things I really like it: first is the 3" screen as I know is largest cureently which let you view the picture clearly. The size is big help to my old eyes. Second the pictures replay on camera are much faster almost immidiately after you took. The third one is "screen cleaning" performed everytime you turn on and off camera which I have not notice any difference yet but I hope it works. The fourth is fast continus shooting, 6.5 pictures per second. I have not used this yet but sure it well help when I go air show. There are several functions more than 10D. 10 mega pixles is not that important to me for most the pictures I took. All the L lenses work with the new camera and I think the quality of picture is depend on lenses. It is little big and heavy than 10D but not much. It is cheap than 10D I paid 5 yeas ago. Overall, I love it.

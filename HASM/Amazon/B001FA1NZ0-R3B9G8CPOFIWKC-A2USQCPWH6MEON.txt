Title: 2 failed earphones w/remote & mic in two workouts
Content:
1st failure:
One hour into a run, I tried to advance a track, go back one track, and select a playlist.  All functions failed.  On two occasions, a single press of the selector, the volume maxed out instantaneously, and this selector should have no effect on volume.  My suspicion was that the controller could not tolerate the moist conditions, as I sweat a lot while running.  I went to the nearest Apple Store, and a specialist gladly replaced the earphones/controller, which worked fine, until the next day...
2nd failure:
The controller worked fine before my run.  Less than 20 minutes in, the same problems occur.  This time, without pressing anything, the earphones instantaneously went to maximum volume.  I returned the iPod shuffle to the Apple Store after leaving the gym and questioned why a controller for an iPod, otherwise ideal for working out, would not be sweatproof.

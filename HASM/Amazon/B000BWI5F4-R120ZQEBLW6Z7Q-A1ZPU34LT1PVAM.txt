Title: Great for lazy apartment dweller like me
Content:
I usually think of vacuuming as involving a lot of heavy lugging around, which means that I tend to put it off for months at a time. Or I'll get motivated to do it at really bad hours for someone who lives in an apartment. This vacuum, while I haven't tried it at night, is definitely a polite one for an apartment-dweller to have. It doesn't seem to be much louder than my hair dryer, which is great. It's also super-lightweight, so the idea of lugging it, doesn't put me off. The lightweight-ness might make it seem "cheap" in construction, but so far I haven't had any problems. It gets me vacuuming more than I normally would, which is a huge benefit. Also, it fits in my closet well, which is good for apartment life, where space is at a premium. I've experienced better suction from other vacs, but I accept the trade-off in terms of ease-of use.

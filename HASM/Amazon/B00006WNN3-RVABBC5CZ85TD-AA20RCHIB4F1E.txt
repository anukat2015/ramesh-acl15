Title: Not worth the money
Content:
My husband and I received this as a wedding gift, and after a year (we used it about 10 times as we don't drink a lot of coffee), the latch that holds the area for the coffee grounds closed broke. It won't stay closed for anything and there is no way to fix it. I'm very disappointed.

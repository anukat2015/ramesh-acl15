Title: good SLR for beginners
Content:
the only downside is the number of lenses that are compatible with auto focus is very limited (the lens need to have its own motor) however if you are comfortable with manual focusing you can attach almost any nikon compatible lens to it. then use it as a manual camera, also I found it difficult to add a lens with low fstop (1.4-1.8) to the camera unless you attach an extension tube or a tele converter between lens and camera. generally speaking I am having fun with it still I prefer my canon ftb 35 mm camera! be aware that the sensor in DSLR cameras are smaller than 35 mm so the actual area that is covered is much smaller, however you can review the picture adjust and do thousands of changes before printing it, also you have great control over flash power.....makes life much easier.

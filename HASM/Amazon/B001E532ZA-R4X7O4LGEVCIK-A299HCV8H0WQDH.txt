Title: Lives up to its billing, but beware...
Content:
The Bosch Tassimo makes good coffee.  There is no argument here.  It even makes good tasting latte's.  Coffee house quality, even.  They're not lying in the descriptions, and it lives up to its rating here on Amazon.
However, keep in mind that when they say it's a one serving coffee maker, that's what they mean.  My normal sized coffee cup gets filled just over halfway when using latte mixes or the hot chocolate.  With coffee it's a bit more generous, but you'll still need to hold the silver button down to fill your 16oz. travel mug...and when you do that, it's just mixing in more water.
Final thing you should keep in mind is the price of the t-disks.  When you do the math, you'll pay (on average) about 70 cents per serving of coffee.  So if you want a strong morning blend of Starbucks coffee (it really does taste like Starbucks), you'll pay roughly a buck forty...which is about a dollar less than just going to Starbucks.
The question you need to ask yourself here is... do you NEED Starbucks coffee every morning?  Will the regular stuff do?  Can you survive with it, then splurge every once in a while on the good stuff?  If so, then don't spend the money on this machine.  YES, it will make coffee house quality stuff every time, but you will only be saving about 35%.  If you're on a budget, the smarter move is to suffer through the regular coffee maker and wait till you find a better job.

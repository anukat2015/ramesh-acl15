Title: Big heat from little Footprint
Content:
I bought two of these for my two-bedroom apartment in Cleveland.  It gets C-O-L-D here, folks!
This unit takes the chill out of the air in a few minutes, but doesn't over-heat the surface it's on.  I put them on the linoleum, on the carpet, on end-tables.  With both units on medium, I can get the livingroom, diningroom, and kitchen up to 68 degrees in just about an hour - with outside temps in the 40's, and a drafty, century-old building!
They are fairly quiet, considering the heat they put out, and I appreciate the safety features, since I'm always walking into them and knocking them over with my giant feet.  They just shut down until I set them upright again.  Nice, LONG cords on these puppies means I can get them anywhere with limited outlets.  I'm looking forward to many toasty nights this winter, thanks to my Lasko heaters - WITHOUT running my gas-guzzling furnace!

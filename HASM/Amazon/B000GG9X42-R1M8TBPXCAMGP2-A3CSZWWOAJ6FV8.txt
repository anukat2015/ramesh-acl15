Title: Good heater but don't knock it over..
Content:
I've had this heater for a year and a half and haven't had any problems with it till
one day I knocked it over. The thin glass heating element doesn't have any support except
for the top and bottom. I knocked it over and the element broke in the center.
I would have been good for the manufacture to add a couple supports along the length 
of the element to support it. Buying a new tube is out of the question. Manufacture
wants you to ship it to them for repair. It's cheaper to buy a new heater.

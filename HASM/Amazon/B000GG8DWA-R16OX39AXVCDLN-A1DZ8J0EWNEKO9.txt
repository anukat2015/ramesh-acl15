Title: Good one for room size around 10x9
Content:
I recently bought this Optimus H-5210 heater from Amazon, very happy with it so far. It has two 400W light tubes, total is 800W. Exactly like it was said on Amazon, specially very quiet, unlike the other fan like heater I have which makes wired noise if you don't put it on maxmum heat power. My suggestion is put this close to you, for room like mine 8×10, 400W is good enough to keep you warm, not too hot, just cozy.

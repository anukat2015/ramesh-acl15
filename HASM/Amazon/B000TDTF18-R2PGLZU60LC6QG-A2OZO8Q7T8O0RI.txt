Title: Best Coffee Pot Ever!!
Content:
I have purchased a lot of coffee pots through the years. Some for the style, color, and some for the brewing. Some have been good - some not so good.  This coffee pot is awesome. Good looking - Easy to use - Great tasting coffee and an extra special feature that I love - No more pulling out the unit to fill with water. Just open the front of unit - fill with water - put coffee in the basket and boom your done. If your looking for a good coffee maker with a decent price - I say, BUY THIS!!!

Title: Bulky but worth it!
Content:
I'm sure like the rest of you, I have been reading review after review trying to find a powerful vacuum for dog owners. We have 4 dogs AND I have very long hair! I have serious dust/dander allergies so I have to make sure the dog hair is under control. I have to vacuum everyday! It makes sense to buy a Bissell because they make wet vac's which need powerful suction capabilities. I've NEVER owned a vacuum that is this powerful. I've gone thru 4 vacuums in the past 2 years and am FED up with light weight, cheap vacuums.I've owned, 2 Dirt Devils, Hoover and Eureeka. Invest the extra money, you won't regret it. This vac is so powerful that when it moves forward, it feels like it's moving itself. I also attach the brush attachment and vacuum my dogs hair! There's a center cup in the waste container that holds all the fine dust/dirt, and to say the least I was amazed at all the dirt that was in there. My carpet feels new again and the HEPA filter kicks A$$!! It also filters the air while you are vacuuming! I highly recommend this to anyone who has pets! 
PROS:
BEST HEPA FILTER YET
STRONG SUCTION!!!!!!
CLEAR CASING OVER THE FLOOR ROLLERS SO YOU CAN SEE JAMS
VERY EASY TO DUMP THE WASTE
EASY TO PUT TOGETHER OUT OF THE BOX
CONS:
BULKY
HEAVIER THAN MOST VACUUMS NOW (BUT ONCE YOU FEEL THE SUCTION POWER, YOU'LL KNOW WHY. IT'S BUILT GOOD)
1 ATTACHMENT NEVER STAYS IN PLACE (I JUST KEEP IT OFF THE VACUUM IN A DRAWER)

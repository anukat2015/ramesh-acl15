Title: Don't own it, but be serious folks. FIX it.
Content:
If you don't like the "paddle-boat" noise, take a 1/8" drill and make a drain hole at the lowest point. I own a model that annoyed me in the same way... until I got out my trusty DeWalt. 
I did always wonder if the water helped cool the condenser evaporatively, though.

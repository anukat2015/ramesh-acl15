Title: ASUS makes a good job
Content:
Since I bought this laptop, I decide for the brand name. I use it for a designer work.This machine came with Vista OS and the promise to obtain W7 free with registration. I receive 3 days later a dvd to upgrade the OS. Excellent until this point. 2 days more to upgrade the laptop won't start. I make a call to the Assistant service. They gave me a RMA number. 10 days later I receive the same machine with a technical report "corrupt OS. Reinstall Windows Vista". Until today the computer works excellent. I am afraid to put the upgrade to W7 because I think it was the reason of the previous crash.
The laptop is beautiful, thin and light. I bought this in a third party store. BUY.COM.(I recommend you read well the warranty policy in this site.) They send me the equipment well packed, signature confirmation FED.EX third day, at house front door. Really an awesome service. Thank's to all(AMAZON.COM; BUY.COM and the technician service of ASUS). God Bess America.

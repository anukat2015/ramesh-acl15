Title: Not even close!
Content:
I really tried to like this product.  I was anxious to get it working with my electric fireplace.  At first, the "fire" sounds were perfect, you can tell it was recorded from a real fire; but then....  the sound used to simulate the "pop" was so off the mark, repetitious and absolutely unrealistic, that it destroyed the entire fireplace effect.  They sound like someone banging on an object.  Following the advice from other users as well as the manufacturer, I worked with the placement of the machine (facing away, against the wall, etc), lowered the volume, but nothing.  Finally, I ended up wrapping it with two layers of plastic material to drown the offending banging sound.  Alas, it only killed the much lower "real fire" sound instead.  I give it two stars because the idea has potential and can be easily perfected.  How about just the fire sounds?.  
I suspect the reviewers giving it more than 2 stars either have hearing problems or work for the company.  I returned it without regrets.

Title: New Mac experiance
Content:
As someone with about 20 years in IT, mostly on the server/desktop side, all Microsoft, I have to say that using my new Macbook pro has truly been a pleasure.  I had considered getting a Mac for about a year and finally took the plunge a month or so ago.  The setup was easy and using the computer itself is also easy.  With parallels installed, I am still able to work in my PC based applications without any of the seeming lag that you normally see in any other virtualization product.  I liked it so much, i recently bought my daughter a Macbook.

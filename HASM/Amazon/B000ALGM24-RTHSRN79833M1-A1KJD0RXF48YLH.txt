Title: Best and easiest to use
Content:
This is the best thermostat for the money. It's very easy to program and simple to use. I had one for several years until it needed to be replaced. The electrician replaced the Robertshaw 9600 with another thermostat that was difficult to use and only lasted one year. I ordered another Robertshaw 9600 and I'm very happy with it!

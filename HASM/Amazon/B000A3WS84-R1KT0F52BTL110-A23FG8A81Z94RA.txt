Title: iPod video is number one
Content:
ok, the ipod video is hands down the best mp3/video player on the market now. the video quality is great and the videos take up relatively a small amount of space. i can get a feature length movie to 700mbs w/jodix ipod converter or vidoera.
the sound quality is as good as it gets. since you get 30gbs of hard drive space, you should convert your songs to 192kbps or above(dont know if thats possible for itunes bought music that have the useless DRM, but it works on my cds). the bass is so much richer with 192. i recommend a different pair of headphones though. the ones bundled w/ipod are painful when you put them in. get one that have the rubber things that you put in your ear, not necessarily the noise canceling ones though. A case is a MUST HAVE. the thing will scratch up like crazy. protect your 300 dollar investment.
the closest competition is the creative zen vision:m. it has video playback and a 30gb hard drive at around the same price. people say its better because it has a radio, with voice and radio recording. come on people!! we're in the 21st century for those of you stuck in the 80s. who still uses their radio especially when they can get 30gbs of hi quality music and video??!!it boasts more battery life but i dont belive that. both  the ipod and the zen have 14 hrs of music, but the zen spontaneously has twice as much video playback time than ipod on a same size lcd screen?? that just doesnt make any sense to me. ipod is twice as thin as the creative zen vision:m and is 100x more popular!!

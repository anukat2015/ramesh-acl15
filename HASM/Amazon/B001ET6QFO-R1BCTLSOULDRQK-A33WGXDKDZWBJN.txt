Title: ... wow....
Content:
The Canon 50D is amazing.  Im starting college and majoring in photography.  I gave it some thought and decided to get a new camera. Before the 50D, I had a Canon xti.  The xti was good for me to really just learn somethings out about the camera.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good camera!  I just needed something a little more advanced.  The 50D does that and I love it!  The colors are incredible.  The one thing that I like about it the most, well its a small thing, but I love the shutter.  On the xti, I could not take a picture during a wedding and it not make a loud sound that ruined it all!  On the 50D, it is a lot quieter.  Now I understand that it is probably that way with a lot of other Canon's, but it was a big difference going from an xti to a 50D.  Huge difference!!!

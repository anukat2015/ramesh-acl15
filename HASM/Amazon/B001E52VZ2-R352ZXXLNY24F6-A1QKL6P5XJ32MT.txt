Title: good purchase
Content:
I am pleased with my Mighty Mite vacuum.  It has plenty of power for my bare floors and low pile carpets.  It's easy to maneuver, altho the foot on wheels takes a little getting used to after my previous one that just slid on the floor.  My only complaint is that it is very loud.

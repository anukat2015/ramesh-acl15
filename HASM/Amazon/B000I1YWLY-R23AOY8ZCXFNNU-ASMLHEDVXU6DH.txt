Title: Excellent Canister Vacuum
Content:
We've had the Electrolux  for a few months and have been very pleased with it's efficiency, ease of use, ease of emptying and quietness.  As far as we're concerned, the only feature it's missing is the ability hook the hose on to the canister for easier storage.

Title: Not recommended
Content:
I had to purchase this twice and return it twice. 
Main problem is that it does a horrible job on carpets. The vacuum picks up very little and the worst part about the experience is that the wand constantly detaches from the base, making this unit useless. There are too many moving parts, buttons, etc on the unit which increases the likelihood of failure.
It is also very heavy and difficult to move around. As a result, if you have stairs, forget about it - it's too heavy to lug around the stairs. I like the looks of this machine but it really is not worth buying. Just keep in mind I lost money on this because Amazon did not give me a full refund the second time around. Just a warning  - don't end up being screwed. Buy something else.

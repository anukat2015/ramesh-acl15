Title: High Quality Nikon
Content:
There is not much of a practicle difference in the D70 and the D80. I had used the D70 for two years and nine thousand captures before jumping on the bandwagon with the D80. The view finder is larger in the D80, the viewing screen is much larger then in the D70, and some of the controls have their own buttons for more convenient adjustments. 
But when push comes to shove the D70 pictures are in most recognizable respects just as good as the D80. The extra pixels don't get you better pictures. The D80 makes getting better pictures a little easier. The D80 has a bigger viewfinder and bigger viewing screen which is real nice, but the extra money is not going to get you better pictures. 
For most picture that we take the d70s will do the job and get very good high quality results under most circumstances. The d50 might do the job just as well. 
I like the d80 but all things considered it does not out perform the d70. The exra money would be better spent on a good lens.

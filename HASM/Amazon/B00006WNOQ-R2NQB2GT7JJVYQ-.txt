Title: exactly what I wanted
Content:
I work in a large office where the temp. is fixed and is always too cold.  This heater works perfectly under my desk to keep me toasty.  It is very quiet and it stays cool so that I don't have to worry about the noise or fire hazards. I would recomend this to anyone in a cold office.  I even ordered a second one for my mother.

Title: Wonderful Coffee Machine - Strongly Recommend
Content:
This is such a great machine, quick, easy, quiet, no mess!  We moved and our previous home had a built in Miele machine and it was awesome making restaurant quality coffee's and so forth but what a mess to clean and lubricate all of the time.  It was like taking care of a professional espresso machine in starbucks.  I found this Breville online and read all of the reviews and I am so happy we bought it - we love it as there is no work involved - put in your K-cup and your done!  I have been drinking Timothy's coffees but am stil looking for the right blend for us as we used to use espresso in our old machine but it does not taste the same in this one - I am confident we will find the right blend eventually.

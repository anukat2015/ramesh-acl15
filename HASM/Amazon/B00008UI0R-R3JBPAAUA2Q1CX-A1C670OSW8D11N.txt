Title: Worked well for a while
Content:
When I first  got this vacuum it worked great.  It worked good on all my floors, from the kitchen to the carpet but now the powerhead has so much suction that when vacuuming it comes right off.  I am forced to vacuum using the floor attachment.  I just got this vacuum in the begginning of October.  I went from very satisfied to disgruntled.  I don't know how to get it repaired and I don't feel like the hassle.

Content:
The best 13" ultra thin portable for the price out there (IMHO); anyone who wants smooth,fast HD streaming video and a bit of HD gaming on the go has to get this little power house; its fun to play with the configurable computing environment; and lightening fast boot with Linux(Expressgate) is also included for casual web,music,chat,messaging, and photo viewing in a hurry aside from full win7 OS functionality; what else can I say?!; this laptop is just a solid built, madly affordable, fully functional, beautifully designed and light on your back kind of pet that you would like to be with any minute of the day.  And yes, wish the battery life could be longer and longer and longer... would highly recommend it if you can get your hand on one... :)

Title: A great purchase
Content:
In the market for a new vacuum I did alot of research and settled on the windtunnel.  I really wanted a canister and for the price and the reviews this seemed like the best deal.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I have 4 cats and I don't think my house was ever this clean.  I love having no bags.  I love the fact it's a canister (I previously owned the windtunnel upright).  The suction is amazing.  The cleaning tool for furniture is the first thing I have ever found to actually effectively clean cat hair off of fabric furniture.  This is a great vacuum!

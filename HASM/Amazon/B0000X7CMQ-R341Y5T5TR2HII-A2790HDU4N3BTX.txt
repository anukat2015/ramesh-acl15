Title: Great Design Good value
Content:
I have thus far been very impressed. This machine replaces my Delonghi thermal carafe, which I disliked due to several design flaws that made it hard to pour and caused the basket to overflow many times. I think this was due to the valve at the bottom of the basket being too restrictive. The Zoji has a much larger valve allowing the basket to drain more freely. It still brews slowly by percolating into the basket at a steady even rate. The removable "shower head" wets the grounds evenly and is easy to remove/clean. The Zoji is a very good design and can brew with the lid up allowing you to watch it work. I put a thermostat in the basket and it read ~195° throughout the brew cycle. The coffee came out at the perfect temp. and it was strong and bold, just as I had measured it to be. The carafe is a good design, keeps the coffee hot (I just poured a cup 3 hours after brewing, and it is hot, not warm). The carafe does not drip down the side like my Delonghi used to. My only dislikes are that you have to tip the carafe almost horizontal before it begins pouring, and it pours very slowly. This is somewhat annoying when filling a thermos. If you remove the lid completely, it seems to work alright (Not a major issue). Also the unit is mostly plastic and feels a tad flimsy compared to the full stainless Delonghi. On the other hand, it cost about 70 dollars less than the Delonghi and works much better. Hopefully it holds up for the long haul, because so far it has exceeded my expectations.

Title: Powerful vacuum, but the flaws are too numerous
Content:
My biggest problems:
1) the bare floor attachment is the worst I have ever used. Our Newfoundland dog (think long black hair) sheds a lot and this vacuum really struggles to pick the hair up. The $30 Swiffer Vac we have does a better job - no exaggerating. The opening is almost completely surrounded by bristles, making it hard to suck anything, much less hair, up with the attachment.
2) The extendable wand is awkward. I am used to having a short handle on the end of a cannister vac. Stick a brush attachment and cleaning a sofa, or a car is an easy operation. Fully compressed, the Dyson wand is still almost two feet long. Suddenly, vacumming has become a two-handed operation. 
3) The power cord is too short. Not short in that "kind of annoying" way, but in the "adds significant time to the task" way. 
------
If I were only using this on carpets I would only be mildly disappointed with this model. As is, it needs to be returned. 
If only they would have spent as much time on the small functionality quirks as they did on getting the hose to wrap around it for storage (something you'll likely never do after the first time anyway).
My main suggestion is to spend some hands-on time with it before making the leap.

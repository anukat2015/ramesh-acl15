Title: Love it!!
Content:
I bought this after taking back a pretty expensive Sony mp3 player that was close to the price of this. I was so disappointed with the Sony cos nothing can compare to an iPod. I would recommend this iPod, definitely!! I've had 4 different iPods since they came out and this is by far my favorite. It comes in my favorite color and is a small, convenient size. It has a lot of new, cool features that the other iPods don't have. The screen has such vivid color and picture that it's astounding. It is so self-explanatory and easy to use, unlike a lot of mp3 players. I do not regret spending this much on an iPod, especially this one, because with everything it offers and the ease of use, it is totally worth it.

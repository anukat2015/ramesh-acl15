Title: Good coffee maker, poor design and quality
Content:
Makes great coffee, but you're lucky if it lasts more than 1 year.  I am now on my 4th Cuisinart DCC-2000 in as many years.  After about a year, give or take a month or so, it dies.  I have experienced all the problems with my 4 coffee makers other reviewers have had.  It's a great concept, but poorly designed and unreliable.  The good reviews this unit has gotten are more than likely from people who haven't had the unit very long.  Other reviewers have hassled with warranty replacements and shipping costs.  My suggestion is to do what I do.  I paid for the first one initially (about $100).  Because it's not a cheap coffee maker, when it died, I went to a local store, and purchased a new one.  Then a week later, I put the bad one in the box and returned it to the store for a full refund.  It's under warranty, but this way is less hassle.  The store does not lose out because Cuisinart reimburses them for a returned unit.  I have done this with all subsequent bad units.  Therefore I have only paid once for this piece of junk and maintain a relatively good coffee maker for about another year.  Until they get it right, I will continue to do this because it's an expensive unit and the company should not be rewarded for making a poorly-made product.  I also hate caraffes.  The Hamilton Beach equivalent, although about half price, has worse reviews, so I'll keep playing the exchange game until they finally make one that hopefully will last for more than about a year.

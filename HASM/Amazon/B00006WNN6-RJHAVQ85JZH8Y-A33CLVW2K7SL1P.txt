Title: Not for bathrooms
Content:
Holmes used to make a bathroom heater, and I loved it. I *hate* stepping out of a shower to either a steamy room and a fog drenched mirror, or a room that's freezing because the door was left open (to avoid said steaminess). I live in Chicago, so in the winters, and especially during this long, lonely, cold month, a warm bathroom is essential.
My Holmes heater died last year, so this year I went looking to replace it, only to find that Holmes no longer makes a bathroom heater. I searched on Amazon, and found a review for this heater that said it was great for bathrooms. Given that, and the name of the heater itself "SafeHeat Fan Heater", I thought I might be able to use it in the bathroom.
When it was delivered, I found that it is not intended for use in the bathroom.
I decided to use it in the bathroom anyway, as the tub is far enough away from where the heater is plugged in that death by SafeHeat-electrocution isn't a concern.
It's a nice heater, and works very well. If it tips over, it automatically turns off (still not safe enough for bathroom use...but...)
I highly recommend this, but realize that SafeHeat doesn't mean SafeBathroom.

Title: Excellent DSLR
Content:
Very very pleased with the ease of use and the intuitive menus.  Always shot pics with a Film SLR, till I got a point and shoot digital.  Liked the convenience of digital, but the quality of the photos was just not there with the point & shoot. Very good manual, Nikon software is OK for minor editing and enhancing pics.  Definitely will get a much better editing software package after some research.

Title: Awful and not worth buying
Content:
I bought this product about 4 months ago. It worked fine for the first month but after a while I would turn it on and then it would stop. Just right in the middle of the player starting up! The screen paused and it wouldn't even turn off until it was plugged into a computer.
Another thing I noticed was It would change the titles, artists, or albums on it. It would say something like the song was called "Justin Timeberlake" by Purple Haze, from the album "Billie Piper" It makes browsing through music very irritating. On occasion all of the text in the player would be in Japanese! I would have to delete everything and drag it back into the player.
I also had the problem with the player randomly turning off when it was still charged.

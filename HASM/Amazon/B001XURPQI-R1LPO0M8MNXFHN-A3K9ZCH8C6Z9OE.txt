Title: GREAT PICS GREAT VIDEO!!!
Content:
After years of going through camcorders and point and shoot still cameras I can gladly say I have found my hybrid dream! I bought this camera mostly for video purposes so I can achieve that depth of field which is hard even with camcorders that cost up to $2,000. The only downside is for some reason canon decided to make the 1080p video 20fps instead of 24. I shoot at 720p at 30fps. As far as stills goes, shooting at 15.1 megapixels the photos couldn't come out any better. Pro photographers try to say this cam is "entry level" and isn't a "pro camera" but it's like the little brother of the 5D mark II just that the image sensor isn't as big and it doesn't take 21.1 megapixel stills. This video does what I want with video, and I'm still learning the whole photo aspect. I use the m42 screw mount lenses and an adaptor. I have a 35mm, 2x teleconverter and a 90-250mm lens which cost no more than $25 a piece! 
OVERALL: This camera is a great and affordable hybrid for video/stills and you can easily get the pro look you've been wanting!

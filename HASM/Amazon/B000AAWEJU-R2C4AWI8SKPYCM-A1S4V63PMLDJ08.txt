Title: Great vac
Content:
I've never had a high end vacuum before, so I don't have alot to compare it to. That being said, I am very happy with this unit. It's much smaller than I expected, relatively quiet and works just as advertised. The carpet attachment works fine for me. Between the attachments, it's light weight and long tube, I'm cleaning much more often and better than I ever have before. It's a very well designed, very well made vacuum.

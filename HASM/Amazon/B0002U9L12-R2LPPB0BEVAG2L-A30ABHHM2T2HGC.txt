Title: If you like hot coffe don't but this
Content:
I normally don't write reviews, and heck, I didn't even buy this through Amazon, but I would like to warn all who consider this machine to reconsider.  This coffeemaker will keep your coffe nice and WARM without extra power for the heater element.  But alas, I like my coffee HOT not WARM.  Right after brewing the coffee is not hot anymore, even if you follow the separately included warning to pre-heat the caraffe with hot water for 5 minutes. (Yeah right, who has time for that in the morning, just make me a coffeemaker that works!) I  would expect a little better for the price. Also the caraffe has a terrible tout to pour the coffee, and everytime you pull out the caraffe water drips all over the machine.  What is up with this thing, I thought this is all you do for a living Mr.Coffee !? Get it right next time.

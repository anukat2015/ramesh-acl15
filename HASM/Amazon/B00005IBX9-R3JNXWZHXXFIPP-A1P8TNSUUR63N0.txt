Title: Cuisinart DC1200 Coffeemaker
Content:
After an exhaustive search covering many fine coffeemakers, including bonn, braun, melitta, and others, and desiring a simple machine without any motors, complex moving parts, or other gizmos to fail, I settled on this machine, the cuisinart DC1200.  I also had a year's prior experience with it, and knew it to be reliable, easy to operate, and comfortable with its retro design.  It also comes with a very fine permanent gold tone filter, which means no buying paper filters all the time.  Also, it is a bit hard to find 12-cup machines that are also better machines.  I am delighted with this machine, and have no need to keep up with the development of newer coffeemakers.

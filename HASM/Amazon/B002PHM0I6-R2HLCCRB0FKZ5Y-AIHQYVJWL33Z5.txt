Title: Great WOW effect, but i had to send it back within a week.:-(
Content:
I love this laptop but whenever you move with it in your lap the AC becomes disconnected. When it is on battery power the screen dims about 20% and when I first stated computing with it the screen would go dim, bright, dim, bright. I thought it was really smart and just dimmed because of the bright light I was in at the time. I hope sony in able to fix it (sent it back today), I do not want to have to research another laptop.

Title: Nice laptop if you have the money to replace it in 2 years (or sooner)..
Content:
I purchased a dv9500 laptop from HP approximately 2 years ago. At first I was nothing short of amazed with it. The picture it produced was beautiful and it was very light for a 17" laptop and it looked aesthetically very nice! A months had passed and I noticed it would get VERY hot while using it. I then purchased a laptop fan which worked great at keeping it cool. Little did I know that I was just prolonging a KNOWN problem with the graphics chipsets in these laptops. I should have just let it burn up while it was within warranty! To make a long story short, it finally gave me the HP 'black screen of death' approximately 2 weeks ago. HP refuses to fix the problem with these laptops and I was quoted $400 for a repair that won't fix the underlying problem! A far as I'm concerned HP can stick their laptops where the sun don't shine, because I will NEVER be purchasing another HP product again. I will also be informing my family, friends, co-workers, and anyone who listen to do the same. Consider yourself warned about purchasing an HP product.

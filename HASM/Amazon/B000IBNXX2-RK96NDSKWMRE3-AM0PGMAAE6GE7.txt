Title: Creative products are the best out there
Content:
Originally, I had purchased the ipod nano, but had it for one day and after numerous problems, took it back and exchanged it for a Creative Zen V Plus. I couldn't be happier. My first mp3 player was a Creative also, but when I decided to buy a new one, I wanted pizazz and lots of accessories, and the ipod did those things for me. The ipod is a waste of money, whereas the Creative Zen V Plus has so much more to offer at a lesser price. Stick with a Creative, you don't be disappointed.

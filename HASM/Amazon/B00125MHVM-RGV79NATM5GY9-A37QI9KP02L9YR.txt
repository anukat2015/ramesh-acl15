Title: All the features I need an more
Content:
This camera takes great pictures as expected but has quite a few user friendly available adjustments.  Being able to adjust exposure is critical to me and there are several simple to use features in the camera allowing you to do that.  Shake reduction built into camera works well and allows for use of any lens to take advantage of it.

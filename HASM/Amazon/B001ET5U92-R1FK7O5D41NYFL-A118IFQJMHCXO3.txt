Title: Huge step-up
Content:
I upgraded to the D90 after using the D60 for a couple weeks.  I had high expectations, but I was blown away when I put my hands on this body.  The size, construction and control placement stood out immediately.  This is a true photographer's camera, and it makes the D60 feel like a starter DSLR (which it is).  
I'm just getting started with DSLR (I had a good, non-interchangable Olympus digital, and a great Minolta film SLR), so I wasn't sure if I'd use half the features of the D90.  After a week, I'm finding all of the functionality to be exceptionally helpful.  I'd lose so much with the D60 compared to this body.
I also ordered the Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and WOW!  My first day of shooting in the house, I had a dozen fantastic portraits of my daughter and wife with unreal bokeh!
If you are thinking of stepping up, and you want to have more fun, and get the kind of shots you'd place in a frame, don't hesitate for a second.  BTW, the low light capabilities are impressive.  You can easily use ISO 1600 and even 3200 for prints.  Couple that with a fast lens, and you don't need to flash your kid indoors.

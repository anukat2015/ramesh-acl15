Title: ITS A FAKE!
Content:
This is NOT the Electrolux that you've know for quality. The owner of Eureka (some European company) bought the name Electrolux some years ago and the change is just taking effect.  The Electrolux that you've known for quality is now Aerus. The name Electrolux may still be with Aerus name but it is required to be smaller than Aerus by agreement.  The name was purchased to dupe American buyers...its just an Eureka 
vacuum.

Title: Nikon D80 Camera
Content:
This is a very good camera for the money. The pictures are fantastic. It is very ergonomic in the hands and a ease to use. I am still working on trying all the features as they are numerous. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone that currently uses a 35MM SLR in either a digital or Film format. For anyone currently using one of the small compact Digital cameras, this camera might be a bit daunting but with practice, anyone can become accustomed to the many features the camera offers.

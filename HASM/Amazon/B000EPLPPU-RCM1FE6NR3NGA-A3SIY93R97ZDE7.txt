Title: The Shuffle is the BEST
Content:
This is my 3rd iPod and the very best yet!  If you want to take your movies with you, if you want to organize your musik library and save 1000s of songs, this is NOT for you.  If you want to have plenty of musik in the smallest, lightest and coolest mp3 player ever, and take it running with you, look no further, THIS IS IT!  Ok, it has no screen.  So what?  I cannot be fussing around with my iPod mini while running anyhow! With the shuffle I choose some songs that I like, make a list that I change every so often, and always have a cool running partner with plenty of battery life to last for several weeks sometimes without recharging.
One down side?  It is so small, that you really have to be careful not to loose it!

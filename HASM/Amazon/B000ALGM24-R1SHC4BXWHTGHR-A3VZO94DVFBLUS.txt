Title: It's not the thought that counts
Content:
I got this thermostat 2 days ago and loved the idea of it.  I was able to set it up to a 7-day program that suits my needs.  It took a little figuring out, but was not that hard.  The problem is that the temperature is getting read 3-4 degrees higher than the room actually is.  If it is 68 degrees, it says it is 72.  My husband installed it last night and we were freezing when we woke up because of this.  I called thier customer service (which is not a toll free number, by the way), and they said to give it a few days to adjust.  She said to return it if it does not.  Since it is an online purchase and the winter time here, I can't really afford to wait for shipping to get a new one.  The old thermostat broke during unistallation, so I am stuck with it unless I go to a store to purchase a different one.  The old one still gives and accurate temperature reading though, which confirms for me what temperature reading is off by with the new one.  The heat still turns on when it gets to the temperature that it is set to, so I guess I'll just have to set it higher for now.  So like the title of my review, I like the thought of how it should work, but it just doesn't work right.

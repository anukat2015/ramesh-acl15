Title: It is good but...
Content:
After reading tons of review, I ordered Nikon's latest DX prosumer camera. For the price/performance ratio, it performs relatively well given usable ISO all the way to 1600. I didn't like its 720p video function. I finally decided to go with FX body and returned this DX one. IMHO, FX will be the major format in the near future. D90's lightweight gives me some comfort when heavy lenses, such as Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 VR, are attached. In general, D90 performs very well in well-lit situations but in low-light I always use D700.

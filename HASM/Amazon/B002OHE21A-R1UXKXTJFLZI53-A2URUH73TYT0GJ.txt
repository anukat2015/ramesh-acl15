Title: Just what I needed...
Content:
This is the perfect space heater for my needs. It has been a chilly winter in Florida, and our old home isn't designed to retain heat. 
10 temperature settings and auto shut-off and temp control.... I usually just set it to 2 or 3 and it does just enough to knock the chill. It is slim and fits right under my desk to keep me warm when I'm working, and it's light enough that I can just carry it wherever I need it. I often put it on my side of the bed at night so that both my hot-blooded partner and I can be happy with the temp. It does give off a smell the first few times it is turned on, but the instructions notified me of that and it has to be expected. Highly recommended.

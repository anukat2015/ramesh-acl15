Title: Powerful heat, but has its drawbacks
Content:
I do have 3 of these now. One for each bedroom since most of our bedrooms are over the garage and the forced air ducts just don't seem to cut it in the dead of winter. They really heat up the entire room without any problems and fairly quickly.
The only drawbacks are that if you knock it over, it doesn't always shut-off (supposedly has a tipover safety shutoff function, but it's not reliable if you ask me), and it's tricky to get it to shutoff before the room just gets too hot. You need a lot of trial & error to position the knobs just right so that the room stays approximately at the desired temperature. But often your room may be a little too hot or a little too cold. But for the price, I can't complain.

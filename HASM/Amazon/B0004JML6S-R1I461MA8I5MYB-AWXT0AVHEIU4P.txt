Title: Okay Replacement
Content:
I've read the other reviews, and find no quality problems with the construction of the unit.  The pause-n-serve feature is miles ahead of the complicated-and-never-worked-right Braun.  The ONLY drawbacks are the drips when pouring a cup (what a pain) and the water level indicator filling up with air bubbles.  The coffee flavor is fine, and the programming (although more complicated than necessary) is actually convenient because you don't have to re-set it every day.  Overall, a fine replacement for the Braun 12-cup flavor select.

Title: Great value and killer looks
Content:
I just got my MacBook Pro 13.3 inch from Amazon last week and it's definitely the best laptop that I've ever had (and I've had a lot of them).  I went with the 2.53 GHz/4 GB memory model because I tend to run a lot of applications at once.  I'm easily able to run all the apps I want along with Windows running in Parallels Desktop.  This machine is fast and the battery life is awesome (5-6 hours for just web surfing). I do notice that if I run Parallels the battery life is significantly shorter (around 3 hours), but that appears to be the only app I use that is a battery drain.  The major thing that surprised me about this model was that is QUIET.  I can't really hear the fan at all, which is great since I tend to be annoyed when a fan gets loud.  Best purchase I've made in a long time.

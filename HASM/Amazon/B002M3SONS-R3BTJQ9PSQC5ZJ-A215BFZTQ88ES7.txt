Title: If it aint broke, don't fix it
Content:
I purchased this for my son, who hated it and promptly gave it to my daughter. We have older gen shuffles which we love for exercising, the beach etc. I don't understand why apple changed the old model when everyone loved it. My daughter who is 12 actually needed my help working it when she got it. The controls are all on the headphones and are very tiny and hard to work even for her small hands. They aren't even on the bottom of the headphones which might be better but way up by the earpieces. I can see where people are sweating on them and they quit working.  I searched for old model shuffles for her because she hated this one so much and you cannot find one for under $100 and most are almost $200 even for used models. So doesn't that tell apple they did something wrong? Don't they do costumer satisfaction surveys? Also, the very worst part is that the cord to plug it in to your PC if you want to charge it or add songs is only a few inches long. So, when we plug it in, We have to unplug everything else plugged in back there. I hope apples 5th gen is a throwback to the shuffle that actually works.

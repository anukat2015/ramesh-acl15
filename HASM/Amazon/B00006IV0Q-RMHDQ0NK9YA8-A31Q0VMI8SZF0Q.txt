Title: The good and the bad
Content:
Pro's: Makes a good cup of coffee.  Pot stays on all the time - no lousy auto-shutoff.
Con's: All metal pot is rather hot on the outside. Dangerous around little kids. The older plastic pots were much safer and worked just as good.  Of course, they only cost about $15.
There is a spring around the center shaft that does not look very substantial.  Its purpose is to keep the basket tight against the lid.  I expect it to break soon.  I don't think it will affect the pot's operation
And yes, I do think the price is a bit expensive for a percolator.

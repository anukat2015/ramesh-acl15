Title: Big disappointment
Content:
I bought this coffee maker about 8 months ago. Yesterday it stopped working. The indicator on the LCD panel is for the water sensor, saying that it is out of water (it is not). Despite all the plugging, unplugging, dumping water out, etc., it's dead. In addition to not lasting long, the controls are difficult to figure out and the beeping noise that it makes is really obnoxious (although you can turn off the beep, the noise indicator resets itself to "on" everytime you unplug the machine, which I do every day). This coffee machine also does not come with a reusable filter and requires a "duo" water filter, which is an additional ongoing expense. I did not notice any improvement in coffee taste when I used the duo filter...which oddly enough is made and sold only by Krups.

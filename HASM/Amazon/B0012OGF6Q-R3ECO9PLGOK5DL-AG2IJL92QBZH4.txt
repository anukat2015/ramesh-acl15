Title: Very Reasonable SLR
Content:
For the money this is an excellent camera, giving you most of the features of more expensive Nikons, very decent high resolution images, and with the 18-55mm lens a good starting package. For those who want to get beyond point-and-shoot, or artists that want a decent flexible camera that does the job 90% of the time without spending a small fortune.

Title: Bunn Coffee Maker for the office
Content:
Purchased the Bunn BTX-B Thermofresh for the office to replace a 18 year old commercial Bunn 2-burner coffee maker.  Senior partner purchased the original maker and was very reluctant to part with it, but after several issues with leaking and loud noises, he agreed to the purchase of a new machine.  After looking at several different makers, including many different brands, I was thrilled to see the Bunn Thermofresh.  It works great.  Even without preheating the carafe the coffee is still hot in the afternoon without any bitterness.  The machine is easy to use and clean.  So far everyone, including the senior partner, loves it.  Lets see how long this one lasts.

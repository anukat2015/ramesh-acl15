Title: I love this little thing!
Content:
I have never been able to make a successful cup of coffee using a drip coffee-maker. The brew always came out lukewarm with a taste that only inspired a scowl. This little percolator, however, has been my coffee salvation. The beverage comes out steaming hot and the second cup is as hot as the first. The taste is consistent and exactly how I like it. I do find myself making a pot of coffee at night, which I never would have even thought to do before this little wonder. It's easier to clean than a drip machine as well. I love it so much that I ordered another one for my mother-in-law. Why percolators went out of fashion I'll never know because it's such an improvement over drip makers. Buy it and enjoy!

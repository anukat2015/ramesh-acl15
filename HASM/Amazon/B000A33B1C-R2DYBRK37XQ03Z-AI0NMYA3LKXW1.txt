Title: the owner of the home
Content:
I had to use the Delonghi Safe Heat Oil-Filled Radiator while living inside a dilapidated attic which had a hole in the roof.  It was winter so without this I'd be dead.  I had to lug it up the stairs, it's about 30 lbs, has wheels, and fills up easily, the owner of the home gave me a refill can.  Works okay, minor issues include a "clunking noise" and a horrible after exhaust smell, since I had an open hole in the roof I had adequate ventilation but I did notice some dead pigeons around it.  You're best bet is to have some type of vent open that gets cold outside air.  Don't smoke around this either and don't drill into it at any cost.

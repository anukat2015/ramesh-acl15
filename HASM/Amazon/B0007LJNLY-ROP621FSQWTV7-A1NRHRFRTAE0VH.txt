Title: Shame on Amazon --repeated sale of a defective product
Content:
This is my second DeLonghi oil-filled radiator.  The first was superb -- it provided reliable, abundant heat for several years in a 500 square feet basement rec room (temperature outside ranges in the winter from 15 to 35 degrees).  I disposed of it only because one of our house pets chewed up the wire.  This reconditioned model almost works well -- at last.  It did not work at all when I received it.  The lights went on indicating electricity was flowing, but there was no heat, and the timer did not work.  Happily another reviewer solved a similar problem by opening the cover and connecting two wires which were left unconnected.  I also found two wires disconnected. After connecting them, I have been able to get heat (comparable to my former model), but the timer still does not operate (it runs electrically).  Shame on Amazon for repeatedly selling a defective product and shame on DeLonghi for such sloppy factory reconditioning.

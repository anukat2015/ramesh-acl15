Title: Fantastic!
Content:
a great product.
easy to use, easy to clean and a clean tasting cup of coffee EVERY time!
after having the grind & brew cuisinart coffee maker, which was the WORST coffee maker i've ever owned, i tried this one.  i'll never use another coffee maker.  it's probably the easiest, best tasting and most convenient coffee maker ever made.

Title: sub standard
Content:
Bought to replace an 8 cup which worked for years, reliably. (Make Black & Decker)
1. Very difficult to poor water into tank without spilling.
2. Silly design of carafe with attached lid makes it difficult to pour w/o the cap falling lose and spilling
3. Pause feature - when you remove the carafe, worked only 2 days. Then stopped. Now we wait for entire pot to finish, if not coffee spills everywhere.

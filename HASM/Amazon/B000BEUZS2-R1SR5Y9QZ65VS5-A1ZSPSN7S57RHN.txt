Title: Works just fine, good price!
Content:
we got this to keep my daughters room from getting so freezing cold at night and its been working just fine... set the fan on a med. setting and the heat on low and it keeps the room a comfortable temp. without getting too hot. its not loud at all, about the same as if you were using a box fan or something... good for white noise too if you or whose ever room its in likes that.

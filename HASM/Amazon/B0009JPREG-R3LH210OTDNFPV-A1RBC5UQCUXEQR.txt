Title: Great camera, but beware of auto white balance
Content:
I love the layout of this camera. Every important function (bracketing, white balance and white balance fine-tuning, etc.) can be easily accessed with buttons and dials without having to fumble through menus on the LCD. The camera turns on in a blink and there is no delay between pressing the shutter and the picture being taken.
Some features the D70s has and the D50 doesn't, and that I find really useful:
- Depth-of-field preview button
- Optional grids in the viewfinder
- Direct access button to bracketing functions
- A light on the top LCD display
Auto white balance outdoors seems somewhat off (too cold), however this can be corrected easily by setting white balance compensation to -1. Shade setting is too warm, I compensate it with +3.

Title: Amazing Vacuum
Content:
This is an amazing vacuum. I just received it today and vacuumed the whole house with it. Although I have been maintaining and vacuuming my home very well, you can't believe the amount of dust and particles it took out from my house! It has a great suction power and the power head is acting amazingly on carpets. My carpets now look fresh. Like new!!! I wish I did take a picture of before and after to show you the huge difference it has made. Also, for some reason the picture didn't make me realize about it is huge in size! This is a big vacuum and you will need some fare amount of room to store it. With that big size, moving it around for me was a piece of cake because of it's clever portability design. The power head had 3 levels to adjust the height of your carpet which became handy on my home while vacuuming both carpets and rugs. It also comes with a smaller head to let you vacuum the stairs. Everything is so high quality and great. It's looks 10 times better than the same priced Dyson brands. I loved it so far. Very recommended.

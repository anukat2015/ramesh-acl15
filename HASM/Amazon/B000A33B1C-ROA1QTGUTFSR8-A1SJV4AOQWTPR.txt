Title: doesn't warm me up!
Content:
I don't understand all the great reviews. This heater doesn't keep you very warm. It simply heats UPWARDS, not outwards, so you have to literally hold your hands above the unit to feel any warmth. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment and it's been in the 50s and 60s outside and I'm still very cold with this heater turned on. So it's not working too well. Also, it has a weird smell which does NOT go away. If you have a sensitive nose or any perfume/scent-type sensitivities/allergies, don't get this!!!!! It seems safe and it doesn't take up a lot of space, so that's good... oh and by the way, in the photo it looks like a medium to dark gray or silver, BUT it's actually a slightly off-white color. Hope this helped. Bottomline: If you tend to be cold, get a warmer heater.

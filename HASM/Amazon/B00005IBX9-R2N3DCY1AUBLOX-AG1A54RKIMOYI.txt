Title: Small hole? You probably drank too much coffee
Content:
I had read on consumer reports that this was one of the top drip coffee makers out there. But as I started reading customer reviews on Amazon, I began to second guess their review. 
All I can say is: trust the numbers -- this machine has many more positive then negative reviews. The coffee tastes great and the complaints are just nitpicky. The one my wife and I laughed the most about is that "the water receptacle opening is small, so you should keep a towel handy when pouring water in the machine." The opening is not large, but if you're missing that opening, maybe you should cut down on your coffee consumption.
We've had ours for about 1 month and use one to two times every day (and haven't missed the hole once). So far, we love it.

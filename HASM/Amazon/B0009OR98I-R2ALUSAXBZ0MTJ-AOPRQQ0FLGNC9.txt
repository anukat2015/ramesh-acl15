Title: Defects in workmanship and material
Content:
Very disappointed, right out of the box, which had been opened! (The staples were detached and the box flap was taped.) Could this be an example of what Amazon does with defective returns: tape it up and ship it to the next unsuspecting customer?
The first time that I tried to wrap the cord around the "convenient cord storage halo," I cut my finger. The chrome is pealing from that part. This product may be "quality designed, ... built to last a lifetime," but it is poorly manufactured. The number one requirement should be safety. This product fails that requirement.
Metropolitan boasts "Made in the USA." Yeah, right. Here we go again with good old American quality.

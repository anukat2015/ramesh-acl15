Title: Must know Spanish
Content:
The 14 cup model brews a good amount of coffee, especially nice for the 3 morning coffee drinkers in my household. The instruction manual that was included was written in Spanish only - no English. A slight problem if you don't know the language. The water level indicator is located inside the water resevoir in the back, a very awkward location and impossible to read if you are brewing less than 10 cups. Water collects in the flip top lid of the coffee maker when filling the resevoir resulting in a puddle on the counter every time. Brew time seems long. Love the programmable feature. Overall acceptable quality. Just wish there were more choices available for 14 cup coffee makers.

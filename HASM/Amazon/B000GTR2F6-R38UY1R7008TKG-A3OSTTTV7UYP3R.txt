Title: Single cup coffee maker
Content:
I resently returned from Hawaii and I brought back several pounds of Kona coffee. I'm the only one who drinks coffee in the house and I wanted to buy a single cup brewer. I searched the web for what I could find that 
would fill my needs.I decided on the Keurig B-70. It was around $200 dollars, which is a lot, but I thought this would be what I needed.
The problem is that you need a to purchase a metal filter that costs over $20 that doesn't come with the machine.So, I had to buy this extra and wait another week to use it. I think this should be included for $200 bucks. Also in the photos it looks like stainless steel on the product, But when you see it in person, it is painted plastic. It's OK, based upon other items it should cost more in the range of $100. If it holds up for 10 years, I'll be happy, I only use it on weekends.

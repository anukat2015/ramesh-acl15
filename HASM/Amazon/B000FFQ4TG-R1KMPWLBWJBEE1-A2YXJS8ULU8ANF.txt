Title: I'll never own anything but a Bunn Coffee Maker again...
Content:
This is the best machine ever.  It brews in 3 minutes and the coffee is the perfect temperature and the best taste.  I tried Mr. Coffee before I bought this and believe me, Mr. Coffee is definately worth the 39 bucks i spent but not a penny more.  The Bunn is the best, by far!

Title: Excellent feature at attractive price
Content:
I owned the XTi before and was extremely satisfied with it. I'm sold to the XSi mainly because of the new Spot metering and 3" screen!! Live View is a plus but I only used it a couple of times.
People always compare the XSi to the 40D. Price w/ feature wise their prices are pretty much the same, but the main reason that I chose the XSi was the SMALL SIZE. For people with small hands like me the 40D is too wide and heavy. On the 40D I couldn't reach some of the inner buttons without taken my hand away from the grip.
The IS kit lens is an excellent start but the camera quickly out grown its resolution. I upgraded to a EF-S 17-55mm IS and am very happy (make sure to get a good dust-resistant copy).

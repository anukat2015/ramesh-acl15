Title: Great filter!
Content:
I've been using this filter (with my Hoover windtunnel) for over 10 years and it has never failed me! I will be buying another one soon so that I can wash the old one with water and soap and have an extra one while it is drying...I can't believe that the other poster gave this product a one star because of him NOT reading the instructions. The Hoover Windtunnel is a great little vacuum also!!

Title: GREAT!!!!!
Content:
I have had an iPod before, but I've never an ipod touch. I love it, it's easy to use, I have apps and all my music. People complain about the fact there is no camera, but that doesn't annoy me at all. I love this Ipod it's easy to use, it connects to the internet, it's small and easy to carry plus you can put apps from itunes on it and they've kept me busy for hours. I haven't put my ipod touch down since the minute I got it, I absolutely love it. My only problem is how easily finger prints are left on it, but I'm just going to get a case for it, problem solved :D It's worth the price, it's a great ipod.

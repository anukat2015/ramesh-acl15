Title: Broke down in two weeks
Content:
Bought this for my son. After less than two weeks it kept shutting down because the battery circuit was indicating to the unit that the battery was dead. Tried numerous new batteries with same result. Not worth sending back for replacement or refund as it has to be returned via UPS so we would end up with a whopping $9.00 credit. Advise you invest in an upgraded unit by a name brand manufacturer.

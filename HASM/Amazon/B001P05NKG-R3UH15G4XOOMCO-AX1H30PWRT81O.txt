Title: Once you explore the simpleness you realize how much more sophisticated it really is...

The Macbook Pro isn't an ordinary laptop. It's a lot more than that. In tradition, notebooks are made from multiple parts. Doing so, this adds a lot weight to the laptop and even increases the possibility of an issue the user shall experience within his/her notebook. Apple has done something else. They created just one part, the aluminum unibody. In your hands, the aluminum laptop feels just awesome. The clarity of video on this notebook is remarkable and the screen has a liquid electronic display backlight. That saves a lot of energy and battery. The battery lasts up to eight hours on this notebook and is powered on less the energy needed to power a lightbulb. With this purchase, I'm definitely not disappointed. Apple has changed the way we use computers and will never cease to impress us.

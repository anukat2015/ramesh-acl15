Title: Hot little compact unit...but
Content:
I ordered this portable space heater last week for use in our pop up camper.  We have an infant that camps with us and we like to camp into the fall, so it gets a little chilly at night.  We're not looking to turn the camper into a furnace, just something to keep it comfortable.
Upon opening up the box and removing everything, I read the directions that said to put the batteries into the remote first, then plug the unit into the wall.  The unit should then beep repeatedly so you can sync the remote to the unit.  Well, ours didn't beep repeatedly, it beeped once.  I couldn't get the remote to sync.  I tried resetting the unit, removing the batteries, etc. I went to Bionaire's website for help, and of course any information on this unit was unavailble.
Before giving in and calling Bionaire for help, I futzed around with it a few more times and came up with a fix.  I put the batteries in the remote, then plugged the unit in.  I held down the only button on top of the unit and bingo, the remote synced to the unit.  Now I have full control of the unit and it's automatic controls via the remote.
I ran the unit for about 30 minutes last night to "cook off" any residue from manufacturing so we don't have to smell it the first time we use it.  For as small as it is, it puts out some heat.
We have another camping trip this weekend and the forecast calls for mid 50's overnight, which will be a good test to see how it does to heat our camper.

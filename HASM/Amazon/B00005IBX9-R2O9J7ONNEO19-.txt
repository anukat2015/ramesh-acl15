Title: Great Coffeemaker
Content:
I've had my Brew Central for over a year and love it.  I rarely make a full pot, so the feature for 1-4 cups is great for me. It is also programmable, which is another feature I use all the time.  It may cost a little more than other coffeemakers, but I think it was worth it.

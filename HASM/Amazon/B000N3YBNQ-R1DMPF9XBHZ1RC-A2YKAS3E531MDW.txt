Title: The best I have ever used, even w/o the attachments!
Content:
Ok, ok, yes the bags are small but that really doesn't matter. They are cheap enough and come in large enough quantities that it makes no difference. Hand tools would be nice on occasion but would rather have a separate easily portable hand-held instead! The suction on this machine is incredible. It makes the carpet look like it has just been through a shampooing! For the price this vacuum can't be beat, simply amazing. Oh, and as far as pushing it around, its no difficult then any other vacuum i have ever had, unless your comparing to some piece of garbage like a stick-vac. You can't and won't be disappointed!

Title: Canon 40D body
Content:
I ordered a 40D for my Alaska vacation; didn't want to take my 5D, wanted faster frames-per-second for shooting wildlife and the 1.6 sensor factor for added telephoto reach.
The camera worked great. I really liked the sensor cleaning feature, which cut down a ton on spots in the blue Alaskan sky. The 6.5 fps helped capture eagles in flight and running bears, too.
And the low light capability was put to the test on a couple of dark, overcast days. The camera excelled.
I'm very happy with the 40D, as it will serve alongside my other 40D and my 5D for my professional work.

Title: By Far, The Worse Laptop Ever,,,
Content:
This is by far the worse Gateway Laptop i have ever purchased, i would not recommend it at all. First style is not stylish in any aspect, the materials that it was made of it's very poor and simple. Second, the gestures added to the mouse pad, wtf? this is very difficult to get used to, i thought i could but still not working for me. i tried to disable them but they will still do the gestures sometimes. Third, if you get errors or any malfunctions with this item, it will be very difficult for you to get an answer from amazon or form the "manufacturer" (Gateway) Amazon will  tell you to contact the manufacturer the manufacturer will only make you do a full system factory restore, what is that going to do? erase all your data and start from "0" . You will still have the same problem, believe me. I'm saying this by experience, this so called "new laptop" will give you problems. 
Other bad things about this  laptop is the speakers, the way your opened windows work or display are just stupid, there is too much clicking to just closed an opened window or even go to one.
At last, the ony 2 good this about it it's the battery life and display resolution, the  end.

Title: Good Hardware.  Flakey Software.
Content:
The player itself is really pretty slick.  The external speaker is good enough to let my 3 year old son listen to his favorite music without having to use ear phones.  The picture quality is really quite good.  In fact, in a pinch I have watch several movies on it without too much eye strain.
The downside is the software.  It comes with a video converter that will take most formats of video and convert them into a format that the player can play.  This part of the software is very good.  The rest isn't worth a hoot.  The player is supposed to have a calender/planner and contact book.  You can not create these with the player.  They must be created on your computer then uploaded onto your player.  I have updated the software and searched all over but still can't find where to do that. Not that big of a deal, I guess.  I just like using all the bells and whistles on new toys.
All in all I'm very happy with my Creative Zen X-Fi.  If I lost it I would definitely buy another.

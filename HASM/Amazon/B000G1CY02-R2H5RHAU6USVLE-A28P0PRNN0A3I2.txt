Title: Heater failed within one day
Content:
Previous reviewers have done a good job of describing the excellent and mostly silent heating operation of the Delonghi Mica Panel heater.  I purchased 2 of these  from Home Depot. and mounted them on drywall walls using the included fittings. 
One of the heaters failed rather spectacularly within one day of use. It was set on the 1500w ("2") setting and the wall receptacle was controlled by a separate power switch. When the heater was switched on for maybe the 3rd or 4th time big sparks and momentary flames erupted from the middle of the elements. The sparks stopped so I left the unit on to see what it was going to do. It continued to heat up but was not using all of the elements. After approximately 5 minutes it shut itself down, perhaps due to its overheat protection circuitry and then would not work again. I removed it and will return it to the store.
The second unit has been used a few times and seems to be operating as designed. As others have mentioned there is a short period of expansion noise as the heater initially warms up. This noise was MUCH more noticeable on the defective model than on the one that I am continuing to use. I have to suspect that there are quality control problems in the Chinese manufacture of these heaters.
(If you do purchase one be sure to follow the instructions about "cooking" off the noxious coating that emits the smell when the unit first heats. This took an hour with one unit and more than that with the unit that failed.)

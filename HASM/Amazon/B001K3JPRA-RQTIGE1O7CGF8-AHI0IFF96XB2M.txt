Title: An excellent addition to the 4/3rd family.
Content:
I originally purchased this camera to go alongside my E-3. With the increase in work I've been getting I wanted to have 2 cameras to bring to jobs. After spending a good deal of time with my E-30 it has actually become my main camera. I prefer its ergonomics over the E-3. I much prefer the high iso noise performance of the E-30 over the E-3. It is not that the camera produces less noise, it is that the noise cleans up extremely well (in a program such as the Lightroom 3 beta). I feel that there is also sharper images coming from the E-30 (slightly). 
I know that Olympus is marketing this camera for the "Art Filters" but I never use those personally. I mainly shoot in RAW and process my images through Lightroom with Nik Software plug-ins. I think that if you prefer to shoot in jpeg and would like to bypass using software such as photoshop, then the art filters would be an excellent choice to use.
Overall I am very happy with this camera. If I am going to a job which I feel will require more than one camera (wedding for example), I will bring both the E-30 and E-3. If the weather is bad, I will definitely use the E-3. For everything else I would prefer to use the E-30.

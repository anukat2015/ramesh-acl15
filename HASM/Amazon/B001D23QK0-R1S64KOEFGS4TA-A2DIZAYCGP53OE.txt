Title: Great MP3 player
Content:
I bought this because  I lost my Creative Zen VPlus player. 
Pluses: It was cheaper than the Zen Player, The buttons are easier to use than the wheel. I like the looks.  It is a little bigger so it is easier to keep track off.  This one never locks up and if it does  it has an easier to fnd and use reset button. I like the external speakers, sound is not very good but great when I have to do something where it is impractical to switch to the ear buds like from the car into the house.  
MINUS- I like to back up a little sometimes when I am listening to books and if this one has that feature, I cannot find it. Instructions are HUGELY inadequate and difficut to follow as each step is followed by 15 different languages.  The promo says 32 hours of battery life and I never have had that much power. I turn it on and off many times during the day so that maybe the problem.

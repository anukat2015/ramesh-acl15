Title: Terrific!
Content:
This little machine is a godsend for bare floors!  It is easily maneuvered, had surprisingly strong suction, picks up just about anything, and maintains good cleaning power even as the canister fills.  It is very easy to get out, use, and put away - its lightweight, rolls easily, and does the job VERY well.  I vacuum up dog hair instead of sweeping - it picks it all up and it doesn't fly around and land some other place.  The hose is long enough to get the cobwebs from the ceiling corners, too.  I can't say enough in praise of it.  It does have one drawback - cleaning the filter is a pain, but I have bought an extra filter, and alternate them, so I can clean it at a more convenient time.

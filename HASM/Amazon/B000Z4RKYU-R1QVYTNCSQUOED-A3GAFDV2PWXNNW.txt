Title: Drips Water All Over the Place
Content:
The machine doesn't vent well, so steam condenses inside. When you lift the lid to make more coffee, even the next day, the water happily spills all over the place. My machine is on my desk at work, and I've learned to keep a "clear zone" of about a foot to save papers from disaster. Having a coffeemaker allowed me to stop lugging a vacuum bottle to work everyday, but I would not choose this model again.
Update 11/2009: I got fed up with the leaking and dripping, and got rid of it.

Title: Easy to use, takes great pictures, awesome value altogether!
Content:
I can't say enough good things about this camera kit. I've never owned a still camera before, and I figured I'd jump right into the game with a higher end digital SLR. I couldn't be more satisfied with this camera. I worried about the low light focusing issues other buyers were having, but I didn't have any issues that couldn't be fixed by reading the manual and manually changing a few settings that drastically improved my pictures. I'm very impressed on how simple it is to use this camera. Most people avoid the DSLRs because they're afraid that they're too complicated and too "professional" for someone who doesn't really know much about photography. What better way to learn then by purchasing a DSLR, buying a photography book, and learning hands on? If I had to define this product I'd have to say that it's a professional grade product that even an amatuer (like myself) can get professional results from. It's an extrodinary camera, it takes vivid and clear pictures, and for the body, two lenses, a battery, a charger, two lens hoods, a shoulder strap, and software the $ (after rebate) price tag is an unbelieveable value!

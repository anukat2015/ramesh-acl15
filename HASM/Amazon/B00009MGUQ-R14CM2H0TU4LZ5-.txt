Title: Beware...V505 not ready for Prime Time
Content:
As a Sony loyal type I must say I was rather impressed with the V505BX features (vibrant screen, stylish looks, wireless NIC, etc.)  It soon became apparent that this laptop has an incessant and inadvertent mind of its own.  The touchpad is very buggy and uncooperative, and clicks backward, forward, up, down, sideways (you get the idea)...After reading that other reviewers had similar issues I also noticed the keyboard was not seated very well in its basin.  One side of the keypad seems more elevated than the other.  (very strange)...  As a courtesy, first I sent it to the Sony service site to let them try to fix it.   The support rep said they were aware of the touchpad and clicking issue.  When I got it back from Sony repair (quickly, which is good), the keypad problem was not any better, and the buggy touchpad was improved, but definately not resolved.   O.K. as I said, I like Sony products and want to give it a fair shake..., I then exchanged it for another one (crossing my fingers this experience was not to be repeated)....no such luck! The replacement is far buggier than the first... clicking on it's own!  I'm returning this one and wating on the sidelines until I can confirm Sony has fixed it's &quot;false start&quot; on an otherwise well-designed laptop.  Truly a disappointment!

Title: Letting a five-year-old use it
Content:
Sound crazy?  Maybe, but here is the logic - a rugged, "kidproof" version available in several places has many drawbacks.  The most glaring drawback was the battery usage - the kidproof versions I found took AAA batteries.  The shuffle charges through the USB connection.  The shuffle also doesn't have a fancy screen that can get cracked or broken.  Even better is the built in clip.  The sound doesn't suffer either - my oldest daughter has a 30gb Ipod and the sound quality is comparable.  There is enough space with 1gb of space that my wife can put a playlist on there to use when she works out as well.  The kidproof versions offered only 256 or 512mb of space, and that's for the same price I paid for the shuffle.  All around, it's been a no brainer decision all around for us.

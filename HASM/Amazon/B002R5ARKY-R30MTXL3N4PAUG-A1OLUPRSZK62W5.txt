Title: HP Pavilion Laptop cumputer
Content:
This was a replacement for my wife's Toshiba laptop computer that she donated to our son. She was delighted to have her own computer, especially one that came preprogrammed with the new operating system, Windows7. She is particularly pleased with the speed with which it operates and how easy it was to learn the new operating system. She also uses it as the terminal for one of our two MagicJack home phone systems and it works well with that.
If there are any negatives about the HP dv6-1354US laptop, I don't know what they are. Neither does she.

Title: The MX3228 covers flexes enough to break LCD screen
Content:
I bought the MX3228 in May of 06 and found teh system to be advertised.  In January 2007,  I had the LCD screen crack.  Iontacetd Gateway and explain it broke when I either opened or closed it, their position was It was user induced breakage or it broke because I used it.
The damage was caused by the screen case flexing, not from my abuse.   When you close or open eh screen the cover behind eh LCD screen will flex and eventually you will lose your LCD screen as well.
I woudl give Gateway a score of less than 1 star.  Perhaps -10 would be refelct their level of support.

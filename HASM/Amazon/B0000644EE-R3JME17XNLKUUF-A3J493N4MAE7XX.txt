Title: two pots in less then one year
Content:
We enjoy the coffee from this pot very much, except for the fact that we have returned it to the store twice in one year, the same defect. The glass top has broken on both pots. We're ready to trash the pot an go with a different brand. We enjoy perk coffee much better then that of a coffee maker.

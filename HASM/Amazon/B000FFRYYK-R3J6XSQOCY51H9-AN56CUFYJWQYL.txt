Title: EXCELLENT COFFEE MAKER !!!!
Content:
I love this coffee maker!  I read all of the reviews and looked at a few others before purchasing the BUNN.  I am glad I got this one.  The stories about the leak in the carafe were the one thing I was concerened with before the purchase of the BUNN coffee maker.  Their is no leak in the carafe their is a secret for no spillage and that is POUR SLOWLY.  If you make a full pot then pour the first cup real slow and you won't have any problems.  I too thought mine was leaking at first and then took my time and I don't have any leakage on any surfaces when pouring a hot cup of coffee.  The carafe keeps the coffe hot for over three hours and that's plenty for my family.  I had a Mr. Coffee carafe/coffee maker before this one and the Bunn brews a much nicer cup of coffee.  The Mr. Coffee would only keep the coffee hot for about an hour or so.  Get one now and you'll love it!

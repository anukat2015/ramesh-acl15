Title: Buttons are very vunerable to moisture
Content:
The bubble type buttons on this unit are very vunerable to moisture. If you spill coffee or water on them they will soon stop working. They are not as waterproof as they look, and even cleaning the area around them with a damp cloth can ruin them. If you want a more reliable coffeemaker, buy one with different style buttons, or better yet, one with the buttons on the top, not at the base. My Smartbrew stopped working after one year.

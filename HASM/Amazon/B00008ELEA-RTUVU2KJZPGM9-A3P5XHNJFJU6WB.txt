Title: New owner, poor quality and service
Content:
I have used a Farberware Percolator for years and was very satisfied in the past.  However, my recent purchase was unsatisfactory.  The spout on the pot was poorly welded and leaked on first use.  Also, the metal used seems thinner than previous models.
When I tried to return it to Farberware, I was told there would be a charge to exchange the pot.  After one use!  I was told the company was under new ownership and that is their new policy. 
The problem was quickly resolved by Amazon, who knows the meaning of customer service.  Lesson learned:  do business with Amazon, never purchase Farberware products again.

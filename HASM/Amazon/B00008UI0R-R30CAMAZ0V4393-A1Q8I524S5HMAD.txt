Title: Powerful - but falls apart.
Content:
I have never used a vacuum that cleans carpets so well and breaks so fast. After two years it is garbage. It is heavy to use. It does not work well on tiles. It just falls apart and leaves red and black rubber marks everywhere. I have read a lot of reviews now in need of something new, and I see that I am not the only one having problems with Hoover and durability. Even if it sucks well - it just is not worth it.

Title: Laptop
Content:
I needed a laptop for internet access, basic photo editing and word processing while traveling. Therefore, my main criteria were weight, size, and battery life. Overall, the computer does its job in what I need and I am quite satisfied with it. I bought the ASUS external DVD drive with it which is ready to go after you plug it in. Very easy to use, even for someone who is not technologically skilled as I am.
I had a problem at the beginning with loading up websites. Each side took about 30 seconds to load and I started becoming really frustrated with it and was about to send the laptop back. However, I called ASUS's help line and it turned out that the antivirus program that the computer comes with interferes with loading the webpages. I uninstalled the program and downloaded AVG for virus protection and everything worked fine.
The main downside of the computer is its touchpad. I still haven't quite figured it out, but it seems quite temperamental and has a mind of its own. Read the other reviews and you will find this to be mentioned there too.

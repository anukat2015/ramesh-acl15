Title: Good features, works well - not sure about the quality
Content:
This heater is a bit more expensive than most. But unlike the heaters I've bought recently this one is very solidly made with good features. It has a thermostat that shows the current temp even when it's off. It has a high and a low manual setting and also a high and low thermostatic setting. In addition it has a timer so you can tell it to turn on after a certain number of hours and then turn off after a further period of time. It also oscillates. That's a lot of features for a [...] heater I think.
The heat output is standard - all forced air heaters seem to max-out at the same wattage. The fan can be felt about four feet away which could be better but on the other hand it's quiet and non-obtrusive yet gets the job done. I have a feeling this fan will last a long time.
My one complaint is that there is no visual indication whether it's on or off.
I do feel the remote was overkill, though.
Update: I've owned it less than 6 months and the fan has become a lot noisier than it was. I took the back off and although the wiring and construction is quite good I note the fan's bearings have become quite lose. I'm changing my review to 4 stars.

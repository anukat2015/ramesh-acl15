Title: Good hardware only
Content:
If you uninstall everything on this machine, every last bit of software, including the OS, then install a decent OS and the software you actually want, it will run fine. 
If you buy it as configured from HP, it simply will not work for very long. 
I got this as a gift, and it ran for three months before Vista crashed permanently, so badly that it could not be recovered and I had to install all new OS & software from scratch. The hardware is very fast, but the 90+ background processes that HP installs to make it all touchsmart-y make it run like a TRS80. 
Worse, the media software they install is like some sort of virus magnet. Despite three very well-respected security programs, I spend at least one day a week just letting the virus programs update and scan, and they always find a ton of malware. It always comes through the media software too. 
If you're just looking for a piece of hardware that will work decently well and you plan to spend a couple days customizing your OS and software, then this will be fine for that purpose. If you want it to actually work out of the box...not so much.

Title: Good for the money.
Content:
A good buy. A good basic laptop with a good screen.  Pretty fast for the money and good applications included especially for e-mail. Not awfully robust. We are on our second one, a fall off the desk did in the hard drive in the first one and we found it to be the same price to purchase new as to replace the hard drive.

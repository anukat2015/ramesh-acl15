Title: The Best, Cheapest mp3 player ever!
Content:
This is one of the best products I've ever bought. I have had a sansa before and it SUCKS. The reason apple ipods are top sellers is because they put the best equipment in there. my 4 gb ipod had a 320x240 screen, and an incredible processor. Everything is so smooth. It is great looking at videos and photos, and music is a breeze (love the cover flow feature). All this in the thinnest electronic device I ever bought. My only complaint is when using the shuffle songs feature, I hear a lot of the same songs each time I do it, and it doesnt seem very random. Other than that, it is an incredible device. Go buy it.

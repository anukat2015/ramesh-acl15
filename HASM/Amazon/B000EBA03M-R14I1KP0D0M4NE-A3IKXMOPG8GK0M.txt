Title: Fabulous camera
Content:
I had a basic point and shoot digital camera and was missing some great pictures due to the delay.  My kids are competitive swimmers and I wasn't able to get action shots even in the sports mode.  I decided to upgrade to a SLR.  This camera came highly recommended by a local camera shop. It is easy to use. It comes with 2 lenses, the zoom is great.  I am amazed at some of the pictures I have taken already.  This camera has capabilities beyond what I will use, but I the pictures I have already taken are to be treasured.

Title: First time Ipod touch owner
Content:
So, like everyone else, I was hoping for a camera. didn't even want a camcorder, just a still camera, but alas it was not to be. Then had to debate whether or not to go ahead and get the touch anyway or not. After 
Amazon dropped the price $20, decided to go ahead and get it.
This thing is amazing. I still can't believe all the things it can do. I have never had a device with a touch screen before, so maybe I'm easily impressed. One of the big selling points for me for this was the app store. Didn't need a smart phone (and didn't want to be pay for more than the basic monthly fees for phone service) so that ruled out the iphone. When you hear in the commercial "we have an app for that", it doesn't seem to be that far from the truth. Truly makes the touch a multipurpose too. There are several apps I can use at work as well as home.
Of course it has all my music and podcasts on as well. I've downloaded a number of free games for my kids to play, and the fact that this thing has wifi for internet surfing is a major plus as well. Especially like that I can find directions on Google maps, and it will save my them (at least for last search) even when I'm offline. Should make finding my son's away football games much easier. 
All in all, very pleased with the Touch.

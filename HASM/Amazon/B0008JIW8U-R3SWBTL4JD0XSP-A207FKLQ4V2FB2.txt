Title: A nice, cheap coffee maker.  But not for the connoisseur.
Content:
Well, I guess i've had it for quite a while now, I believe over half a year.  I've broken-in Dunkin' Donuts pre-ground into it.  Well, for the first two months or so, it tasted good.  Now though, it's about watered down, and, erg.. I want to say bitter, but thats not quite the word.
So I cleaned it like the booklet said to, with vinegar (calcium deposits build up from the water and give it that off-taste.  But it still doesn't taste right.  I don't think this coffee maker would be for the typical coffee connoisseur; unless its the type of connoisseur who likes to savour the taste of bad sewer water mixed with stale folgers coffee.
Maybe i'm not quite cleaning it right, I don't know; but i've done everything the booklet has said and it never has tasted the same as before.
Everything else works fine, the programmable modes, timer, etc.  There is no beeping or anything when its done making, just loud hissing from the steam; but I guess its loud enough to qualify as such... you'll definately know when its done.
In the end, I think its a good coffee maker for the people who don't care about the taste of coffee, and just drink it in the morning to get started or whatever, or because they're addicts.

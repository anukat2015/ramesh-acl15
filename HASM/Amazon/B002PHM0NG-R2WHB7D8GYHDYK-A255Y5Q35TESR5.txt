Title: Good Stuff
Content:
The VAIO VGN-NW270F is a great product. Very sleek and stylish. The operating system, Windows 7 is great. I love the size of the monitor. At 15.5' it is great for watching movies on the go. With the built in blu-ray, it's perfect for travel. The only downside is the short battery life, so keep that AC adapter close by. Overall, good stuff. I would buy it again if I had it all to do over again.

Title: iPod Nano Review
Content:
The camera is in an awkward place, and if you are running with the device in your hand, it's almost impossible to control with one hand.  I'm not a fan of Apple's physical design, but the functions are really cool.  I bought the iPod mainly for use with Nike+ and it works amazing with that.

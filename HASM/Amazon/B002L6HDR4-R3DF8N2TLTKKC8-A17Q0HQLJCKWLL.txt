Title: Love it
Content:
I had a zune but it broke on me twice and I liked it but they couldn't fix it so I tried the bigger zune because of the internet option but it turned out not to great.  So I took that back and bought the iPod nano.  Boy I wish I would of bought that first.  I love the fact that I can listen to it without headphones.  I love that I can record videos.  Plus it has a lot of other options that my zune didn't.  I'm still learning on the software but that's no problem.  I don't write reviews but I like my iPod nano so much that I just wanted to share with others.

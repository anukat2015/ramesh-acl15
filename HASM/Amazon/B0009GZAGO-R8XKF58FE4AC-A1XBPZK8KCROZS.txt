Title: Great camera for the experienced amateur
Content:
Works great like the other reviews mention.  Battery life is exceptional.  The only thing I am adjusting to is the requirement to use the view finder to take pictures - I previously had a Sony and had grown accustomed to taking pictures by viewing the subject in the LCD display.  
In general, I am very happy and love the fact it takes standard SD memory cards.

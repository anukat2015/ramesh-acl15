Title: Flimsy but works as advertised
Content:
We bought this because our sofa sits over the vent in our living room. We could not find one of these vent extenders anywhere around our local area, When we found this one on Amazon, it was not a hard choice, The extender works as promised but it is made of plastic and is very light. Because of this we find that the product got kicked around a lot and was frequently knocked off the vent. We solved the problem with a little duct tape. Now there are no issues and the heat flows much better from under our sofa.

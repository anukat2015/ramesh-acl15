Content:
Got the Kenwood-branded version of this unit from Home Depot (they're the same).  Once it gets heating, it will only heat about 4" from the sides and about 8" from the top.  There's no way this could heat a room, let alone a small closet.  Further, once it gets going, it smells terrible (it's oil filled).  I know these are intended to heat by radiating heat (slower than, for example, ceramic heaters), but I left the unit on for several hours at 'full blast'.  Another problem is the timer - if you choose to use it you're basically stuck with whatever schedule you set -- if you want to use it outside the set range, you basically need to eliminate your timer settings (by setting all of the 96 increments to their 'on' position).  As a result, if you got home early one day and wanted to be warm, you'd have to lose your timer settings to get it to turn on.

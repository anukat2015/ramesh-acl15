Title: Great for the money if you can't use a window unit
Content:
I wanted to put an evap cooler in our upstairs bedroom but the window where it would go was too narrow.  I checked all the reviews and descriptions I could find on several different web sites and decided to go for this portable unit. It has large water capacity, easy to move, can use as a fan only, add ice for real cool air, easy to add water, is quiet enough we left it on one night while we slept.  Fan force good, it really moves the air on "high".  Haven't emptied it yet, we have had 100 degree weather so it has been on every day. The "humidity" controller basically just determines how much water flows over the filters.  The unit does not cool the room like a window evap unit would, but I do recommend it to take the temperature down 15-20 degrees.  I am very glad I purchased this product and if I needed another cooler I would get this one again. It actually isn't too bad to look at either.

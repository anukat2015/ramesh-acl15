Title: Slow to heat, requires some air movement to work well, and takes up a lot of space
Content:
We bought three of these heaters last year to augment our heat pump. My husband likes his just fine, but I am not as satisfied with mine.
The problems I've encountered:
1.  The heaters take up a lot of floor space.  You have to have some clearance around them to keep nearby items from catching fire and this takes up a lot of much-needed floor space.
2.  The heater needs a ceiling fan moving or some other kind of air stirring to work to its best effect.  I prefer a heater with a fan setting that will stir the air up instead of just a radiator.
3.  The heater is slower than my smaller fan-based heater.  If you're really cold coming inside, this heater will not get you warm quickly. 
My husband, who is not as cold-natured as I am, uses his DeLonghi heater in the basement just fine.  But if you want to get warm faster without having to have a fan on and take up a lot of floor space, you might look at a smaller fan-based heater.

Title: great little heater!
Content:
We have a pretty small bathroom on the third floor of our house, which is not heated at all, and I bought the heater to use in there when we take showers and whatnot. It has kept us toasty warm this winter, which is great since it's single digit temps outside here at night. 
We don't leave it on all the time like other people do, just turn it on when we go up there into that room. The room warms up almost instantly! I like that it has a temperature gauge, and it doesn't bother me that you have to keep pressing the button to "scroll" through the different temperature settings to turn it off. It's just pressing a button like, maybe 5 times. How hard is that? Excellent product for the price (I paid just under 30 bucks).
I like it so much that I am thinking of buying a second one for our larger bathroom downstairs, since other reviewers have said it works as well in larger rooms. That room is not only larger, but has 2 giant windows that let in some terrible drafts, so it would be an excellent test of this little heater.

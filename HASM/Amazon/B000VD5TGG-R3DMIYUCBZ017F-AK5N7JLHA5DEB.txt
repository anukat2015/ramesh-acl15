Title: Excellent carpet cleaning, poor vacuum
Content:
I was really excited about this because of the multi-function use. At the same time, I was skeptical. Our little dog likes to pee in small places on the carpet, so we needed good carpet cleaner that would deep clean these areas. 
The carpet cleaner works very well. Both the large cleaner extension and the handheld spray and suction the water, which most others do not do. It was a decision between this and the Hoover Agility. The Agility does not seem to have a sprayer on the extension hose.
When it comes to the vacuum, it's not that great. The suction is only good enough for area rugs. The carpet extension has a air powered brush that stops working on normal carpet and it only cleans the top surface debris.
So, if you want something for hardwood and deep carpet cleaning this is great. Just don't try to replace a regular vacuum cleaning with this.

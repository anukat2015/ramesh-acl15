Title: I'm loving it!
Content:
I got this one after I fried my 20GB model.  This is a definite upgrade, and I am loving the color picture. The only drawback I can see is that I cannot find a compatible iTrip that does not also require the plug in to the cigarette lighter; so you cannot simply use it on it's own battery life to go through your living room stereo.  I will just have to find an adaptor for the iTrip.  Great, great iPod!!

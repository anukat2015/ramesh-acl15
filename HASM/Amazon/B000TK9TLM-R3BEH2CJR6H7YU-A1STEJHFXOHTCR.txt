Title: Great Value Heater
Content:
I bought this heater because I was able to "test drive" the same product from a neighbor who moved and didn't want to move with it. I was impressed by the ability of the heater to maintain heat in my son's bedroom. I am using it to heat 2 small rooms in my home that my furnace doesn't reach. It works quite well and would recommend it to others in the market.

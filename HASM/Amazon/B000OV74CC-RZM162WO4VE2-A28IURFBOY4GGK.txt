Title: sansa express, small, sexy and versatile
Content:
This thing is remarkably small. I bought an 8GB micro SD ($100) which fits in and works seamlessly, so for $60 + $100 I have a 10G music player that also has FM radio, voice recording and file transfer/storage and all smaller than an old school pack of chewing gum. For me it's the perfect device. One of the best features is the charging from the usb port. I go days between recharges. Also audio books download well to this device. Two issues though. It should have a scroll wheel rather than the buttons. It stores so much info that basically tabbing through everything (albums, fast forwarding, etc..) takes a lot of time and I'm scared that after awhile all of that holding down of the buttons will wear them out.  Also, it seems that you can't just plug it into a computer and play the songs. It needs to download the song through  something like Windows Media, then play it. On my regular old usb key I would plug in, double click a song and it would play. Not really a big deal. The other issue is that you have to move music with Windows Media. No itunes, but that's Apples' fault, I guess. All around a great, mini player and usb key that does much more and holds much more than a nano.

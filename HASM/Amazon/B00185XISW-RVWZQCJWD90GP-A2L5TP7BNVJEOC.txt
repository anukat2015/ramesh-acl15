Title: Great Heaters, I have 4 in my home
Content:
I have 4 of these units in my home. I had my husband install the first one and it was so easy that I installed the other 3 myself. I have seen a 40% decrease in my heating cost and I only used about 1/3 of the gas this winter that I did last year. I really love them. I would suggest that you use a programmable thermostat along with this unit to make it a no brainer. I have no regrets and plan to buy one more for next winter.

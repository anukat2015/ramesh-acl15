Title: Doesn't sync with computer anymore
Content:
I've this device for almost a year now.  It still plays, and my computer will charge it with the USB cord, but my computer no longer recognizes it.  This started about 6 months into it's life.  I can no longer add music to it, or take it off.  After all the updates from Microsoft, it still doesn't work right.  My husband also has the older original 80GB Zune, which does the same thing.  It seems like Microsoft has a lot to work out with these MP3 players.  It's not worth the money spent.  I wish I had gotten something else.

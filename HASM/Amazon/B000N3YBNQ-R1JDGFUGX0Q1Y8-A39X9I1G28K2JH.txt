Title: Great Vac, Wish Bags were Bigger
Content:
The name "Intensity" is perfect for this, because the vacuum really does clean our carpet. The cons are that there are no attachments and the bags don't last too long (especially with our dog who seems to replace its coat daily). All in all, a great buy.

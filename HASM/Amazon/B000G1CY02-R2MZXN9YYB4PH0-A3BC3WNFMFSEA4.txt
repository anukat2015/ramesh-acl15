Title: Good for smaller rooms
Content:
Bought one of these - with varied options for use.
Ended up going in smaller childrens room.
Pro's:  Works well to boost or even replace forced air heating on cold winter days. Will heat a small room. In a larger room will only heat area at which radiator panel is directed. Fair enough.   
Thermostat works well enough. 
Looks good. Place it against an empty wall and it looks like the interior designer placed it there. 
Con's: Relatively cheap build. "Plasticy".  Particularly the control knobs are pretty flimsy.  The consolation is, you only notice that if you touch it/ pick it up.  
NO Thermostat
Will not heat larger room much. If you want that, you will need a heavier radiator style heater for better heat diffusion.
In conclusion: For $80 its fair value. Make sure you know what/ how you want to heat.  I will buy another of these for another smallish room, but will choose an (uglier - in my opinion) radiator style unit for the larger room.

Title: Great little heater for a small area
Content:
I was looking for a heater that would fit under my desk, and provide slow comfortable heat without popping the circuit breaker.  This is an excellent heater for an office or other small area.
The heater is rated at 400W.  I tested the current draw a few times by plugging the heater and my computer into the same outlet strip, and turning them on simultaneously.  No problems - the circuit never tripped (of course in actual use the heater should be plugged into a wall outlet).
When used under a table or desk, I've had to turn it down to near it's minimum setting.  It provides enough local heat that I can turn the main furnace down 2-3 degrees.  For the cost of a 40-watt light bulb, I can work in comfort!
Although it doesn't get as hot as a fan heater, like other oil heaters it is sometimes too hot to comfortably touch.  Be aware if there are toddlers or flammables nearby.
The product page is sketchy on details; heater dimensions are approx. 21.5"L x 15.5 "H.  Width ranges from 0.5" at the fins to a 5.25" W at the base.  Weight is just under 7 pounds.

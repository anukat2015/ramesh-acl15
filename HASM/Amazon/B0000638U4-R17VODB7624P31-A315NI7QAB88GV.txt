Title: Avoid This Product
Content:
My experience with this product is totally unsatisfactory since purchase in early summer. Out of the box it was defective, as it leaked water. Following instructions I returned it to an authorized service rep. rather than return it to Amazon.com as I was informed that it was an easy fix. Weeks later and after many calls, I was informed that DeLonghi changed its parts agent, and they could not find the parts!  Of course 30 days had past so Amazon would not accept a return. The service agent instructed me to return it to the manufacturer. I did ($84). A month later, no response nor satisfaction from the manufacturer regarding repair, replacement, and no satisfactin from Amazon for refund. Conclusion: stay away from Delonghi products until they have their act together.

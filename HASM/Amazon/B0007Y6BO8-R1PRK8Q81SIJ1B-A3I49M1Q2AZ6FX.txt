Title: One Star is to high
Content:
My first time with Krups Krap.
Bought this in Nov 07 to replace a very old Braun.  Wanted another Braun but they don't make it any more.  After two months and experiencing all the problems others have written about (fill level gauge with bubbles, carafe dribbling regardless of how you pour) my FME2-14 just lets the water run through the bottom after you fill the tank.  Fortunately I was still in the kitchen when it quit brewing and the water just started running all over the counter.  Contacted Krups and lets just say, NO more Krups Krap in this Kastle!

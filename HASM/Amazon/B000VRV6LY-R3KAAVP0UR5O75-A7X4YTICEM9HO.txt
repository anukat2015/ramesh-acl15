Title: d-3 great-where it came from not so
Content:
The D-3 Nikon has been great. The thing I'm concerned about was the box had been opened, the camera seemed to have been used and strap was missing. Although Amazon was able to correct the problem of the strap quite quickly and the camera seems to be fine, we are talking about a $5000.00 camera, somebody should have checked....Thanks....Rob Mueller.

Title: i REALLY LIKE THIS BACK UP CAMERA!
Content:
I LIKE MY NIKON D 90 THE BEST BUT I HAVE ONLY THE 18-105 MM AND A 100-500 MM LENS.  I AM 76 YEARS OLD AND HANDI-CAPPED AND DON'T GET TO WALK TOO  MUCH SO I FIND THE CANNON XSI HANDI TO GRAB WHEN WE HEAD OUT THE DOOR. SOMEDAY, IF I LIVE LONG ENOUGH I WOULD LIKE A 105 MM MICRO LENS. THIS CAMERA, THE CANNON W/55-250MM LENS IS GREAT FOR QUICK SHOTS OF WILD TURKEY AND DEER WHICH ARE IN ABUNDANCE HERE DOWNEAST  MAINE.I ALSO DO A LOT OF SHOOTING OF THE MAINE COASTLINE WHICH IS SOME 3500 MILES LONG. THE CANNON IS A GREAT STARTING CAMERA FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SWITCHING FROM POINT AND SHOOT CAMERAS.  GOOD LUCK IN YOUR QUEST FOR GREAT PICTURES.

Title: Great for the small bathroom
Content:
I bought this heater last year for the guest bathroom thinking it was inexpensive, and small.
Now that it started getting cold again I could not find the bigger heater for my master bath, so I got this "little one". I mounted it on the wall (away from the bathtub and shower). It took all of one minute to mount it.
The thermostat setting is great because I leave the unit running all the time at 65 degrees, then bring it up to 70 in the morning. It only came on once or twice overnight, but the bathroom is not icy cold.

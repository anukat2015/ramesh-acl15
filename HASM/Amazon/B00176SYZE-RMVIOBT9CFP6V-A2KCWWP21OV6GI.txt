Title: Disappointing
Content:
I had high expectations for this mp3 player, but from the start, the screen froze continuously.  It would turn off in the middle of a song and I had to constantly reset it.  Finally, even resetting didn't work.  The menu keys would not come up and so I finally gave up and returned it.  Thanks for nothing Coby.

Title: Poor Quality Product
Content:
I ordered these foot warmers because my toes get cold and numb very easily in cool temperatures. The battery packs that strap to your legs were awkward and bulky and quickly slipped down my legs to my ankles as I walked. I felt some warmth when I first plugged the "cozy feet" in, but could not detect any heat a few minutes later. I returned the item to Amazon for a full refund.

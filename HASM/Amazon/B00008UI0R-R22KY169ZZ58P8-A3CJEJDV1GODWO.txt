Title: Hoover Canister WindTunnel Vacuum
Content:
This is my third Hoover WindTunnel bagless vacuum in 12 years. I am very [...] vacuums as I am a constantly vacuuming my home, garage, sheds, etc. I've tried other brands in between, such as Electrolux but I always go back to this Hoover because it can get completely flat to go under all beds and dressers, etc. Others I've tried cannot. It picks up great and being able to empty and see all it picks up by emptying the dirt and cleaning the filter after each use is important to me. The only draw back with this vacuum is that it is a bit heavy to push, but still the best one I've ever used.

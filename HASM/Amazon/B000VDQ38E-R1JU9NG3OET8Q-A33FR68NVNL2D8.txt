Title: great suction
Content:
I really am impressed with the suction of this Bissel vacumn. my only problem is that I am disappointed with the BRUSH still rotating on the bare floor setting.  I have real wood floors and they do not do well with the brush....I wish it had a wood floor setting, like the Dyson has, so the brush would NOT damage my wood floors....My bedrooms are carpeted and it works GREAT....but on the hardwoods, I have to tilt the vacumn back and use the hose attachment....

Title: Great digital SLR camera for beginners
Content:
This a great camera for amateur photo enthusiasts who want to try out different exposure settings, and see the results immediately. One of the best features I found in this camera is the concept of auto-ISO. This enables the camera to set the ISO setting automatically, depending on the shutter speed and the amount of ambient light available.

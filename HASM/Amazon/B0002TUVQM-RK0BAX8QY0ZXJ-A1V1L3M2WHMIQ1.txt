Title: If You Think This is a Good Idea, Don't!
Content:
I bought two of these, both at Bed Bath & Beyond. I loved it; I made hot cocoa and instant coffee with it. After a year or so it developed this dingy film on the "blender" part and just smelled. It became another useless accessory in the kitchen that just became disgusting over time. Don't buy this product, just make your hot chocolate the old fashion way.. in the microwave. It takes less time and it's much less of a hassle to clean a pot or a mug than this thing!

Title: Great little heater!...
Content:
I've tried MANY space heaters, and this is the Best of the bunch, really takes the chill off a small to medium sized room, economical to run--use the 800w setting for a while, then switch to the 400w setting...This type probably not the safest to use around young kids, but does have the safety tip-over/shutoff feature...I have 2 that I use in my apt., recommend this as a Best Buy!

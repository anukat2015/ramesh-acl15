Title: Great While it Lasted
Content:
I bought the Edenpure 6 months ago. It kept a small room at a comfortable temperature. A couple weeks ago it inexplicably stopped working. I plugged it in and nothing happened. I contacted customer support, and I was advised to send the unit back, at my expense, for a replacement. The warranty only lasts 90 days.
The customer service rep. did not sound surprised to hear that my unit suddenly stopped working. It sounds like the concept behind the unit is good, but it's poorly made. I will not buy another product from this company again.

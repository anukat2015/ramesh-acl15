Title: 8 GB Ipod nano
Content:
Neat machine. Should have come with better instrcutions and software. Everything had to be downloaded from their site. Video feature is nice. Another good software feature was conversion of file types. The only bad thing about that was that now I have 2 copies of songs on my computer. One for itunes and one for everything else.
Seems very durable. My kid wanted an Ipod. For my use, just any basic MP3 would be fine and MUCH less expensive.
Was delivered promptly.

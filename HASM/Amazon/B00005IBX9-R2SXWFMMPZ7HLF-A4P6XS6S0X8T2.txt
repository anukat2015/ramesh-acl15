Title: Cuisinart grind and brew coffeemaker
Content:
We are on our 3rd Cuisinart.  After 4 months the water did not drip through often requiring repressing on 2-3 times.  At this point the grinder basket does not lift out of the pot. It has to be forced up from underneath.  I love this coffee pot and wish the quality was consistent.  Cuisinart has not been responsive with complaints.

Title: Very good coffee maker
Content:
Did quite a bit of searching to find a good thermal carafe coffee maker for a decent price.  This one makes good coffee because it gets the water hot enough to properly brew the coffee grounds.  Only irritant is the carafe lid is a little difficult to unscrew if you close it too tightly.  Could use a wider lip on the lid.  This one gets about 6 brews a day, since it's used at the office.

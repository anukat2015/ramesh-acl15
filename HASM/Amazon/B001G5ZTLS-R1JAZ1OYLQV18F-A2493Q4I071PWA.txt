Title: Wonderful Camera
Content:
About a thousand dollars more then it should be. Tried my friends out, great pictures but even he admitted it was over priced. Gonna hold onto the 50d till price come down next year. It takes great pictures as well. I don't need the movie mode, that's what my video camera for. I wish you could buy the camera without the movie mode. I feel like I'm paying for something I don't want...........

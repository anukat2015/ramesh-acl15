Title: One Great Camera
Content:
Some of the other reviews here and online have found fault with the kit lens and the lack of add ons like depth of field preview.  If you need those upgrade to the D80.  This is not a Pro camera and people should not look at it as such.  It is an entry level DSLR designed for those moving from a point and shoot digicam.  
The controls are intuitive and easily mastered.  I was up and running with full features after two hours of fiddling and that is the beauty of this camera.  It is ergonomically perfect and your finger will naturally find the shutter button unlike the heavier Canon XTi. No it doesn't have an auto focus motor in the body and you must buy the Nikon auto focus lenses but my sense is those who buy this camera aren't the type who are willing to drop $500 - $2000 on a lens anyway. 
Bottom line is it creates great pictures with the kit lens and the quality of photos are leaps and bounds beyond the basic point and shoot digicam.  If you're a Pro don't buy it, if you're not you can't go wrong with this little beauty.
After the fact I also purchased the 55-200 VR lens
Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom Nikkor Lens
With this and the kit lens you have everything you need to take great pictures in any situation.

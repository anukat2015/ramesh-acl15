Title: Excellent.
Content:
I bought this flash player as a replacement for my Ipod Video (first gen), and so far, everything about it is better. I never was a fan of ipod and their tendancy to break. This mp3 player so far seems more durable even though its more plastic-y. Music, video, radio...it all works perfect, and the screen is excellent too (very bright and sharp).
The only downside about this is that it doesn't have some of the cool, modern features you can find in other flash players, like the samsung p2. It doesn't have a touch screen, or a unique way to navigate through the menus. It seems like its technology is a little bit behind some of the others available. 
Overall, I would recommend it over an ipod. Excellent mp3 player.

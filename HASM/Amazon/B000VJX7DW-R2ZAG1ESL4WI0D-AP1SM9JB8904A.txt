Title: D50 to D300 Fantastic
Content:
I started reading reviews on the D300 and knew I had to have it. I didn't want to go to the expense until after the holidays. But, after reading more reviews on Amazon and other sites, I threw caution to the wind and ordered it in Dec. for $1799.  It came just before Christmas and I have fallen in love with it.  Before the camera was delivered, I purchased the Nikon 18-200 VR lens and the MB-D10 battery pack.  What a combo.  It takes great pictures and it looks good doing it.  I couldn't be happier.

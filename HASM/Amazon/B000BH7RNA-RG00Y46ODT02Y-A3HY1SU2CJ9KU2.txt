Title: makes coffee but messy and bad design
Content:
It does what it was designed to do, which is make coffee. It makes hot coffee. That's about where the good things about this maker stop. 
1. The basket where you put the grounds and filter is almost too short if you're making more then half a pot and you put in the recommended amount of grounds they float, which is the process of making coffee, but water will pump almost too fast into the grounds. This causes the grounds to sometimes wick their way up and over the filter. You have to use two filters almost every time to avoid getting grounds in your coffee carafe.
2. We had two of these and eventually the buttons 'stick.' This happens regardless of careful use. Ours started turning itself off. My husband has dutifully taken it apart and cleaned them off more then once. We've decided if it fails again we're replacing the maker with a different one.
3. The 'sneak a cup' feature is handy but goodness is it MESSY. It will continue to drip a little instead of completely stop which is somewhat understandable. However, the four or five large drips hit the hot burner and this then causes little coffee droplets to spit all over the counter.
4. Carafe design is awful. It is balanced OK but that's about it. You will drip coffee on the counter or down the pot no matter what. If you've made a full pot you HAVE to carefully pour into your cup while keeping the top/lid of the carafe off the pot otherwise coffee will follow the natural curve of the carafe and up against the lid and pour everywhere BUT your cup.
We got ours for free for our wedding but I wouldn't purchase one. Spend a little extra and get something that has less problems.

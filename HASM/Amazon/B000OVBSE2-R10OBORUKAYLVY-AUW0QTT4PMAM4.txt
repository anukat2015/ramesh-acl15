Title: Just a little bit of a pain
Content:
Make sure you know how to change your computer media player to the correct format because mp3 format is the only format this player accepts!!   I had to go to the Sansa website to read troubleshooting problems and replies to figure it out.  Other than the pain of having to do that it is a neat little first player for kids.  Next one will have a screen.

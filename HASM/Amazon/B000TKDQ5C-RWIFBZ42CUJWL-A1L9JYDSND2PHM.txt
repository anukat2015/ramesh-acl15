Title: blows the fuse almost every time we turn it on
Content:
We bought two of these to replace the Lasko that lasted us forever. We wanted one for the living room and one for the office. We quickly realized that we couldn't have both of them on at the same time because that would definitely blow a fuse, but we also learned we couldn't turn one on when any other minor appliance was on elsewhere (like the toaster oven in the kitchen). Also, we hoped these heaters would use less energy than our big overall apartment heater, but last month's bill was $30 higher than when we used the gas heat. Maybe the problem is our fuse and not the heaters, but the Lasko we had before never caused any problems. 
So we're returning the Lasko heaters and are bummed about the $16 shipping to return them both, but hopefully our sadness will help another shopper. PS, other reviews mention these heaters being noisy and I didn't think they were.

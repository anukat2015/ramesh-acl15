Title: Number 1 for a reason
Content:
From the sleek sexy design to the easy to use hardware and software, the iPod is at the top of the MP3 game for a reason. This generation of the iPod Classic is as good as it gets, with the extra storage space and the inclusion of Cover Flow. 
If you have a large music collection and want a little style to go with your substance, pick up an iPod Classic. You won't be sorry.

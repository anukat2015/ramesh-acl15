Title: A great buy that you won't regret!
Content:
I was actually considering a few cameras around the price range: nikon 80d, canon 40d, nikon200d, pentax k10d and this one.
Amazon pricing is very competitive for this camera.
After using it for like a month I would say it is a great camera.
What made me choose it in the first place was simply the image stabilization. With it, u save a lot on lenses as all the lenses would be stabilized... not needing u to fork out hundreds more for a stabilized lens. another feature is the live view function. I dun use it often but when need to... such as taking up a building and placing the camera near the floor... it is great to have!
And the camera has a sensor cleaning function that actually works!
I would say that for the price u pay for the 2 kit lens is of super value and this is a great camera for beginners as well as those who wants to experiment and even for advance photographers.

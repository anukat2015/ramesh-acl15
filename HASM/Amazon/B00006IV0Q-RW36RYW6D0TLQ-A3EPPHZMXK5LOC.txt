Title: Love it
Content:
I researched forever before buying this coffee maker to replace my old drip machine (which never made tasty coffee, I thought it was just me). This thing had consistently positive reviews and I couldn't be happier. Probably the only thing I miss about my old coffee maker was the auto shut off. At least I never had to worry that I'd go to work without unplugging it. Aside from that, I love the coffee that comes out of this machine, I love that it brews quickly and is ridiculously easy to clean. Everyone that comes to my house is impressed and others are now going to get one too because the coffee just tastes so much better (and is so much hotter).

Title: Everything I hoped it would be
Content:
Got this right after Christmas.  Wanted something I could run with, use in the car, or at the gym.  The screen is really bright, it's super easy to use, it sounds great (even the built in speakers-you don't need headphones to listen to music with this iPod- work better than expected).  It is exactly what it says it is.  I got the 3 year square trade warranty as well.  My last iPod died 11 days after the warranty, so it seemed like an easy choice for me.

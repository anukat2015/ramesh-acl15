Title: Love this player!
Content:
For those of you who are looking for an alternative to the iPod, you won't be disappointed with this player.  The controls are easy to use with a nice layout and very visually appealing.  Although the screen is a bit tiny, the picture is exceptional.  The player is very lightweight, and can easily be slipped into your pocket and carried around.  I also really like the Zune program used to transfer your music onto your device- easy to use with a cool layout.
I wish the player had a clock, but I guess we can't have it all.

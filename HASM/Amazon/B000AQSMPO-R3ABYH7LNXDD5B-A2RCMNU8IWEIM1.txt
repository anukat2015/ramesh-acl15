Title: Best Single Cup Coffee Maker
Content:
I've had this specific model (B60) since last Christmas and I absolutely love it.  Previously, I had the Senseo Coffeemaker, and I really liked it too, but, it was so messy changing out coffee pods.  It's annoying to have to change this drippy mess each time I wanted to make a cup of coffee.  Also, with the Senseo, there were very limited number of flavors and choices. 
The Keurig Brewing System is automated, clean, easy to use. The reservoir holds enough water for several cups of coffee.  The K-cups are easy to insert, and there's no drip when disposing of used ones. 
And, best of all, there are literally dozens, if not hundreds of varieties of K-cups flavors.  IT'S FANTASTIC!  It's worth the extra money to spend on this unit.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

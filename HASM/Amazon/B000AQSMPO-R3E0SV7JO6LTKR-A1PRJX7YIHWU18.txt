Title: Fresh cup of Joe
Content:
What a great way to start your day, or end it.  I really enjoy the Keurig coffee maker. I am not one to drink a whole pot of coffee at one time.  I like a fresh cup of coffee, not something that has been setting on a burner for a couple of hours. For those of you who are not true coffee drinkers, you can tell a difference in the taste. As for preformance, we will see.  I have only had it for about a month now and it has held up very well. Believe me it gets used all day long.  I gave up soda's so this is my only fix for caffine. The hardest thing is finding a good coffee.  I have found 2 so far, but I am sure there are plenty.
I also purchased the filter you can use to brew your favorite blend.  My wife really likes this. I would too, but I do not like her blend.

Title: My Most Useful Kitchen Item and my standard wedding gift
Content:
If you drink hot tea or instant hot drinks, you will love this machine!  This is the best and most used item in my kitchen.  It's way better that heating water in the microwave or on the stove.  I actually own 2 of these: one for my kitchen at home and one at work. 
TIP: The Pyrex Glass Measuring Cup 2-Cup fits perfectly.

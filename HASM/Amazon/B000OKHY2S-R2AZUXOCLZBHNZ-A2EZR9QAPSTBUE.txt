Title: Gave as a gift!  They LOVE it!
Content:
I gave this to my son and his wife as one of their wedding gifts.  They live in southern California. She wrote to me "I thought it was going to be just like a ceiling fan type thing, where it just blew the warm air around, but nope-this thing blows out ice cold air-just like the air conditioner of a car-and the whole apartment is SO much more comfortable because of it.  And it has provided much-needed relief to the cats too, because they were so unhappy in the boiling heat.  Now they're both situated directly in front of the air cooler and couldn't be more content.  So.......THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!"
What more could a mother, mother-in-law ask?!

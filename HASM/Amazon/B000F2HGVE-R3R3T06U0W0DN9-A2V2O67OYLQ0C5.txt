Title: Skip this machine!
Content:
I am not a fan of this machine. The filter did not fit into the machine properly and it leaked water all over my counter top. It seemed cheaply made. Of course it is a low priced coffee/espresso machine, so maybe this is what you get for the money. I returned mine.

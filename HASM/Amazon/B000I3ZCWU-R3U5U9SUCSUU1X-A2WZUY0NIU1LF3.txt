Title: excellent camera, but don't get the kit!
Content:
I've been using the 400d/XTi for about 2 weeks now, and I love it.  Shutter response is very fast, and the LCD is easily readible, even in very bright conditions.  The 9 point AF is far superior to the 7 point AF offered on the 300 and 350d models, and the added resolution (10.08 MP) is a nice bonus.  The anti-dust protection, particularly the automatic sensor cleaning, is great as I change lenses quite often.
I'm sad to say that the 400d has replaced my (more expensive) 30d for most applications.  The 30d clearly has a better build quality, but that's the only advantage I can see at this point.  If you want a lightweight, moderately inexpensive prosumer-grade camera, the 400d is about as good as you can get for the money.
PLEASE NOTE: if you are new to digital photography, the camera is important, but lenses are FAR MORE IMPORTANT.  If you want to get great results with the 400d, you're going to have to buy good lenses.  The kit lens (18-55, NOT USM) sucks -- it makes a good paperweight, but that's it.  If you're a beginner I'd recommend the 50mm f/1.8 MK II (or the f/1.4, if you can afford it) to start.  The f/1.8 MK II is cheaper than the kit lens, and while it's a prime (doesn't allow you to zoom) it's much sharper in low light conditions (and the f/1.4 is even sharper than the f/1.8).
Overall, I give this camera a 9 out of 10.  For the price, it's the best you can get.  Just remember, lenses are more important than the camera.  A 300d with L-series lenses will outperform a 400d with low/consumer grade lenses in all settings.  If you already have a 300 or 350d, save your money and invest it in better optics.  If you don't already have a dslr, this is perhaps the best entry-level model on the market.

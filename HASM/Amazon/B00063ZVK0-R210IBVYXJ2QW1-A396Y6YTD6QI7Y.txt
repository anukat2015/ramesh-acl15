Title: Warm, but beware the BUZZING
Content:
Bought this heater for my office, which gets cold as a result of my building's erratic temperature control system, and it works very well in terms of keeping the temperature comfortable.  I like that it isn't extremely hot directly in front of the heater, and that the safety functions seem quite good.
However, as remarked by another customer, the heater emits a distinct BUZZING sound on the low setting.  I found this very irritating at first, but have gotten used to it.  Also, since it is in my office at work, it's not a huge deal.  However, I definitely would NOT buy this for a bedroom -- it would probably be difficult to fall asleep with this on.  
 
Rather than deal with the return process, I'm going to keep the heater, but had I read the earlier review about how noisy this heater can be, I would have gone for a lower-priced Holmes model that many say is very quiet.

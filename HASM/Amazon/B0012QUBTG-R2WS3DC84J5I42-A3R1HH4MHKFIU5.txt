Title: Room heater
Content:
Read a lot of good things about this heater. Not all of it was true. I gave 3 stars as the features are good, it quiet and does give off decent heat for medium rooms. I live in MI, winter is a bear at times, and when trying to save cost, this is a good heater for a medium to small room (10x10). Unit will struggle and you will be cool to cold in a room much over 10 x 15 unless you can really close off the room well. Would not recommend this for someone that likes it toasty and has a large room, this would just take the nip out if that.

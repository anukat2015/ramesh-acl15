Title: Best iPod yet...
Content:
Doesn't have quite the bells and whistles of the iPod touch, of course... but this is really for hardcore music-lovers. The touch (in my opinion) is more of a multi-media device.  Got my son one for his birthday and he's insane over it. I still have my "old" iPod Video from a couple of years ago and it's going strong. They've gotten sturdier over the years. 
Great product and worth every penny.

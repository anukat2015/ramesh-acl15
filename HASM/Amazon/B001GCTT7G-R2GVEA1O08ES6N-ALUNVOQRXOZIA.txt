Title: Once you go Mac, you never go back.
Content:
Those who bash this work of art have only two legs to stand on.  The glossy screen--not a problem if you adjust it properly.  I tried one and it was not a problem for me.  And the other item is the lack of a fire wire port.  Many people don't need this--if you do, get a MacBook Pro.
This is the finest portable laptop made. I bought one for my niece for Xmas and I know it will last her through high school and college and much farther into the future.  It is solid--made of metal not plastic.  The screen is bright and comes on instantly.  It is way cool.
If you haven't run Apple software you are in for a treat.  There are lots of good applications to chose from--including MS Office for those who need mainstream word processing and spreadsheets.
This is a rock solid, stable operating system that never crashes.
What you don't get with a Mac.   A Virus.  A machine that needs constant tweaking and fussing.  
Buy one and you will never regret it.
I own a Mac Pro, Mac Mini, and new this year in the family, a MacBook and and iMac.

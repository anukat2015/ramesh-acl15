Title: Great MP3 player
Content:
This was my first mp3 player EVER, so I did my reasearch before I bought.  I'm very happy with the product and it sounds great-takes some getting used to, simply because I personally have never had one.  The only drawback is not the product itself, it is the marketplace-where you buy your music.  It advertises about 3 million + songs, however, it doesn't have alot of songs I am looking for-mostly dance music, as I wanted to use it for when I to my cardio workouts.  I was very disappointed also, when I couldn't take files from my computer and put them on the Zune-I tried many many ways, but just couldn't do it.  I will keep trying, there may be a secret to it-I just haven't figured it out yet.  There are ALOT of songs on the marketplace, don't get me wrong, but just not all the ones I was wanting!!!  Still a great product, tho!!!

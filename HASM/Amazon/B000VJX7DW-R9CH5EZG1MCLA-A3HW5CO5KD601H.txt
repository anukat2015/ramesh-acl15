Content:
I have been using my Nikon D80 for about a year and decided it was time to upgrade. I did my research and bought the books to learn the D300 before I purchased. I have taken a few courses at my local University in Photography so I am not a complete novice in my Photography Skills. A 10 day Caribbean cruise was coming up in the next 2 weeks when I decided to purchase the D300. The moment I received the d300, I charged the batteries and started snapping away. I'm not sure if the camera was the issue but when shooting in manual mode (which I have always done to get the Depth of field and exposure as I need it) I could never get the exposure correct. I adjust the main dial and sub-dial to get the exposure and it always came out over-exposed and under-exposed. I was never able to get that line in the middle through the view finder. 
In the live mode, it seems I had to hit the button 2 to 3 times to get the shot. I tried several different dial adjustments and nothing seemed to work. After a few days I decided to return the D300 and took my D80 on the trip. 
I'm not sure if it was the camera malfunctioning or this camera is way above my skill level. Since I'm familiar with the Nikon Product, I can't believe getting a good picture was almost impossible for me to achieve on this camera.

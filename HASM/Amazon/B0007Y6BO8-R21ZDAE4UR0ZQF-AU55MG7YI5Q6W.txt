Title: Krups FME2-14 12-Cup...Skip this one!
Content:
I've been a big supporter of Krups Coffee makers for more than 20-years, but this latest offering was pure garbage. The ergonomics of opening and closing the filter chamber felt cumbersome and the indicator level was always challenging to read (multiple bubbles formed inside). I literally had to use a flashlight to read it! Even worse, the coffee (Starbucks, I might add) tasted terrible. I had to dispose of my new Krups in the rubbish and buy a Cuisinart. Talk about a brand image self destructing!

Title: Ibiza Rhapsody 30 GB Wi-Fi/MP3 Player by Haier (Blk)
Content:
It is my my opinion that this mp3 player works OK as a player although it has some problems. For instance, when you switch it off and turn it back on later and you want to start the player where you were when you turned it off, you have to 1. Go Select Music 2. Hit enter 3. Scroll down to Now Playing at the bottom of the screen 4. Enter Again. With my Creative Zen M, I just turn it back on and it picks up where it left off.
The next thing, which I consider major, if, like I did, you are considering this mp3 player because it is wireless, don't. As a wireless player I find it to be next to worthless. It works OK on my home network, but anywhere else, you will need to know things like WEPs, passwords, etc. to connect to a local area wireless network outside of your home network. I thought it was going to work like my cell phone connects to the internet, but no. Plus if, like me, you are no fan of Rhapsody (lots of bugs, freezes up computers) then too bad, you have to use their program.

Title: Good heater. Worth the price.
Content:
I've owned this heater for almost 2 months and as of 3/6/09 it's still working. It does what it's intended to do and does it well. It's compact and looks nice in any room. It doesn't look cheap like other heaters I've seen. There are however several design flaws that I've noticed. For instance, the plug seems to get hot when it's in use for several hours. I'm not talking about piping, burn-your-finger hot but mildly hot to the touch. I wonder if all heaters are like that when they're in use? Second design flaw, you cannot control the heater with the remote control unless you're directly in front of it, which pretty much defeats the purpose of having a remote control to begin with. 
Regardless, I am happy with my purchase. It heats up a room nicely with several different thermostat settings.

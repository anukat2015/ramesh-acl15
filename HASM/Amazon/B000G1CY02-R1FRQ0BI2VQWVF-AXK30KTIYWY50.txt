Title: Wall Mounted Ceramic Heater
Content:
We wall mounted it, and it works well on the low setting to keep our baby's room at 72 degrees overnight when the rest of the house is at 60. Great thing is that it is on the wall and out of her reach.  On the high setting it pumps out so much heat that it overheats and shuts off because there is not enough air circulation, and the rest of the room actually stays cooler. I'd recommend slowly running a ceiling fan to circulate the air.

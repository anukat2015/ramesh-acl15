Title: Nomad Zen Xtra
Content:
I have owned a Zen Xtra since they were first put on the market and have encountered few problems. I still have the original battery and the unit only needs to be reset occasionally. Its 30 gb storage is as much as anyone needs in a mp3. Though this model is probably dated by today's standards, it has been very reliable and has none of the battery issues of the ipods.

Title: Great deal - excellent little device!
Content:
Many of the reviews here seem to be written by iPod "cultists" rather than Rio Carbon owners.  I recently purchased a Rio Carbon for its size - it fits easily in a shirt pocket - and large 5gb capacity.  I'm well past high school, so the "coolness" of owning an iPod did not matter to me - quality and price did. (In fact there is a $20 rebate being offered by Rio through June 2005.)  The Rio Carbon exceeded my expectations in every way.  I already have a dozen CD's worth of music on my Rio Carbon and I use it to transfer large files between my home and work PCs.  One of the best selling points over the iPod is that I wansn't locked into using Apple's iTunes service for music.  Although the Rio Carbon is supported by OSX and can use tracks downloaded from iTunes that are in mp3 or wma format, you can use any music download service on the web.  This can be a big money saver.  If you are looking for an excellent mp3 device with great storage capacity at a great price - you should seriously consider the Rio Carbon.

Title: It is what it is
Content:
Started out by replacing a toilet and ended up with a new floor and a new heater. And other things. The Nautilus was a good style and fit for what I was dealing with. It is quiet and provides more than enough heat for any bathroom. The thermostat works properly and the style is unobstrusive. 
It is easy to access the wiring and to take out the innards so that you have access to mount the box in different ways (not all installations are new construction as you may know!). This also makes it easy to service it and I was happy that it came with a parts diagram, always a good sign.
I found it to be a good and thoughtful design for a decent price. It is recommended.

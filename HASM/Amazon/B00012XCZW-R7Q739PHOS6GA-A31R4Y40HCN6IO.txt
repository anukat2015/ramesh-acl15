Title: The Best Coffee Maker  I Have Owned
Content:
My husband and I love the coffee from the Bunn.  It is easy to use and brews a full pot in 3 minutes.  The coffee is free of any sediment, taste great, and is hot.  Clean up is a snap.  Coffee that has set in the pot from morning until evening still looks good enough to drink.  Someone said the filters were expensive, but I bought 100 Bunn filters at Target for $1.29.  I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone who likes a great cup of coffee.

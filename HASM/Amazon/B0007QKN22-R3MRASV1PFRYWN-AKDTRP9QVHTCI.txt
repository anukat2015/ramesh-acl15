Title: Nice upgrade from old DIGITAL REBEL!!!
Content:
This camera is awesome.  I tried it last night at BestBuy.  They had it for only $949.00 here in Idaho but no black body.  BestBuy only acquired silver body only.
Besides the point, this little DSLR is awesome in my opinion.  Eventhough I love my old digital rebel with upgraded firmware, i think I want to add this to my canon collection rather than 20d.  Since I do this for my wedding business, the one thing I was impress was is the E-TTL II function.  Even if you point the camera for closed up picture, the flash from the camera will fire evenly.  It didnt put it to one spot where it's focusing, which is great.  I think it works like I-TTL balanced fill flash with Nikon D-70.  Flash and wedding is a tough job to conquer.  You think you know it, you have no idea that flash fotography is challenging.  THat's why you we get paid thousands to have excellent picutres come up with $1k camera. hehehehe...... I only use a cheapo but wonderfully work Sigma EF-500 DG SUPER.  Awesome flash!!!
The camera just a little small to hold and a bit not looking pro at all.  But i,m gonna add the battery grip BG-E3 for better grip and pro look to it expecially when i add that zoom lens.  besides, the battery grip will accept 2 proprietary batteries or 6 AA which i love.  only costing me $12.99 for 6 2100mah batteries at costco rather than spending $45 more each for specific battery, which i forget  what it is.
But all in all, the camera is awesome, will work magic to someone's wedding.  You don't have to go 20D for extra $500.00.  Stick with this one, only missing 2 extra focusing point and some software controlled functions and no PC sync.  Other than that, Quality just as the same.  Awesome camera.

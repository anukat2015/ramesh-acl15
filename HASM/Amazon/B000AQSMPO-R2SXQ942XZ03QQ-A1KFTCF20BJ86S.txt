Title: Great Coffe but machine acts up after repeated use.
Content:
I purchased this machine about 6 months ago, and it has gotten daily use since that time.Recently, in the past month or so it has started to "act up". The water does not warm up, or it only brews a half of a cup. Sometimes when you push the button, nothing at all happens.So, what used to be a quick 30 second cup of coffee haas now become a daily ritual of waiting, praying and cursing. I would think that for the price of this coffee maker it would last a littler longer than 6 months without having difficulties. Oh, and by the way, we are conviently well out of the 30 day money back guarntee.

Title: Quiet but doesn't work on carpets.
Content:
Nice little vacuum. Sent mine back after one day. I have all wood floors and one area rug. Problem was that it doesn't do well even on my low-pile area rug. I only want one vacuum cleaner so I sent it back. I also felt the head of the vacuum was rather short which means more passes on your floor. For the price I think there are better options out there.

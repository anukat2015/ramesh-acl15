Title: Great Product
Content:
Unlike the other customers, I have had great success with this product.  The small heater keeps my large bedroom warm through out the night.  The heater has two settings, high and low, and it also has a setting where it will keep the room at a constant temperatrue setting up to 89 degrees.  It can also be set to come on automatically.  I have not had any problems with a bad smell    .  Great product give it a try if you are wanting to heat only one room in your house to save money.  I like it so much, I bought two.

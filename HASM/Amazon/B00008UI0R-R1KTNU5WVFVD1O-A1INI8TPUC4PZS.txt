Title: Highly reccomended
Content:
This vacuum has great features. There's no bags to purchase and love the fact that the dispenser and filter can be easily removed and rinsed clean. It is also light weight and the adjustable bar makes it great for vacuuming furniture as well as stairways. Another great feature is the different levels of suction. This has to be the best vacuum I have purchased in the past 35 years of housekeeping.

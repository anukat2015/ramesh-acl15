Title: Quick cup of coffee
Content:
My cousin recommended this brand of coffee maker to us. We have had several different brands in the years past. Hopefully this one will last. It does makes a pot of coffee in 3 minutes. The one thing I do not like is the fact that it is always on. The water is kept hot in the system. When you want to move it to clean around it the silver part is actually hot to the touch. I do not like that. Also you need to purchase special filters for the grounds. We used the filters we already had and noticed that some grounds were mixed in with the coffee. That happens when you want to make the highest quantity of coffee. So it makes sense to purchase their filters because they sit higher in the funnel. We really wish it had a timer on it as well. We like to set the timer before we go to bed and then have the coffee ready when we wake up. I know its only 3 minutes but it was what we were used to before we had to replace our last one ..

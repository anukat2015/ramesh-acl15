Title: childproof feature is key
Content:
we have an older model and overall we have been happy with it.  it is certainly enough to heat a small bedroom.  it turns itself on and off reliably.  we have several other space heaters (different sizes and brands), but the best feature of this space heater is the child-safe controls.  
our toddler was fascinated with the heater we had in his bedroom and would always turn the thermostat up to HIGH-80 - despite our repeatedly telling him not to touch it.  we finally found this heater, which he can't turn up or on.  you have to push the dial down AND turn it in order to turn it on, or to change the setting from low to medium or high (something a very young child will have a lot of trouble doing).  along with the other safety features, that makes this model the best for keeping in a toddler or preschooler's room.

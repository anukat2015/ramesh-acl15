Title: Dry and Loud!
Content:
Ok, not happy.  I bought this machine because we used to have a commercial Keurig brewer where I used to work.  I was bonkers about that Gloria Jean's French Vanilla Supreme.  Anyways, I did the setup exactly as the instructions said--I even used bottled water instead of my filtered tap water.  On the first run-through (the one without a k-cup to purge the machine) a little water trickled out.  I figured, "Man, this thing must make a tiny cup of coffee."  Then I tried a K-Cup and the only thing that happened was a big loud noise like a jet engine.  There was no coffee.  I took the punctured K-Cup out and the grounds were dry.  Grrr....very disappointed.  I'm sticking with my Senseo pod brewer.  At least it makes a decent cup of coffee and doesn't sound like a plane about to crash into my house.

Title: Great Heat.......Less Electricity!!!
Content:
As a data processing manager, I have seen many office space heaters plugged into the same outlet as the person's computer. Most of these heaters draw 1500 watts at full power, risking popping a circuit breaker and shutting down their computer. Additionally, many of these 1500 watt heaters are poorly designed and melt their plugs over time. The Vornado VH101 Personal Heater draws either 750 or 375 watts, depending on setting. When placed on the desktop or hidden under the desk, it warms the user as well as a room heater without the above mentioned risks associated with excessive current draw.

Title: great vacuum. Very pleased.
Content:
Why do people write reviews about impertinent concerns? Like the vacuum tipping over if you pull the hose out? How about this? Instead of turning the vacuum away from you and using the hose, turn it around, and use the hose so it pulls the vacuum TOWARD you, and not tip it toward you. What a moron. Anyways, to review the vacuum properly, here's my opinion. When I vacuumed my carpet with my dirt devil, which was about $100, I immediately followed using the new Bissell. I'm pretty cynical and hard to convice, but this was awesome. I filled the bag on my 5 by 8 foot rug, and didn't even get to move the table yet. I have two dogs, and this works great. I'm so glad I got this instead of the dc14.

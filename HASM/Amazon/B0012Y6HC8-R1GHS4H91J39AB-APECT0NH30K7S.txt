Title: Review of Xsi Canon
Content:
This is the first camera I've ever owned - including point and shoot cameras...yes, i popped my cherry with a canon Xsi. 
This camera has me wishing that I could relive some moments of my life just to be able to capture them with the Xsi. The best advice I got was to steer clear from the automatic modes and dive headfirst into the different settings to get a feel for what they can accomplish. The pictures are remarkable to say the least, especially the close of shots of inanimate objects. Enough of the objectivity- 
price - very good value - a deal ! 8/10
comfort/handgrip/ease-of-use - 8/10
design/layout of buttons - 8/10 (never used a camera before, but for a beginner, pretty decent)
zoom - limited by use of lens....i.e. buy a zoom lens - for the kit lens i'd say 7/10
replication of real life - 8/10 - RAW format is amazing
Canon software - i'm very new to it, initial 5/10.

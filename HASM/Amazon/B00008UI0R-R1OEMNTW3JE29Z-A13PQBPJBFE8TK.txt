Title: Don't be fooled!
Content:
When I received my new vacuum, I loved it. Well, needless to say, it didn't last very long. I have mostly hard wood floors, no pets or children. My vacuum is not used often or abused. Exactly one year to date the motor burnt out. The warranty is useless and "Hoover", unknown to me, is made in China and the quality has gone way down. Beware and check where your product is being manufactured. It is quite unfortuante that I bought it because of the respected name.

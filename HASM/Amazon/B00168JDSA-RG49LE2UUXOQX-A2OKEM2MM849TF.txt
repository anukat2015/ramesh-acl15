Title: DeLonghi PAC T110P Pinguino All-in-One 11,000-BTU Portable Air Conditioner
Content:
The packaging was damaged but UPS checked it out to make sure that the unit was not damaged before delivering.
I like the ease of moving it from one room to another. The casters roll smoothly. It cools a single room very quickly but is noisy.
The window insert could use some rework. It needs to be beefed up and perhaps some ribs to line it up with the window. It tends to pop out from under the window because the duct is so much heavier than the insert.

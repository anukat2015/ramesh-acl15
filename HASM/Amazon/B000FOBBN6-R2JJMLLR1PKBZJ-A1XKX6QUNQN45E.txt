Title: poor choice
Content:
As stated above, the double pod holder is too big for standard pods. This results in lightly tinted water being brewed. The single pod holder does a better job and delivers a passable cup of coffee. The selling point for me is that you use your cup to fill the reservoir each time you brew so there is no water sitting there to go bad if you don't use the device a lot, which, because of its poor engineering, I won't.

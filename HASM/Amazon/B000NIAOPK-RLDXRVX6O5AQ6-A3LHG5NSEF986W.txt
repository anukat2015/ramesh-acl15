Title: AMAZING PRODUCT!
Content:
This product does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it great! Heats my log cabin in the woods, in winter, to a degree where I'm comfortable. Very VERY light fumes in the air from the heater! Worth every penny I spent! As far as the other reviewer... I'm not sure why he was having so may problems with his unit. Mine works great, planning on buying a second one, recommended to all who need a cheap form of heat for a big space! =)

Title: Very Impressive Vacuum
Content:
After much comparison shopping, I finally settled on this Hoover cannister. I received it mid-week and am so impressed with how well it cleans. My carpets are 15 yrs old, and I swear, I could see the color return more to original with the dirt lifting out with the vacuum. 
It was easy assembly, and fairly easy to pull around from place to place. The powerhead is quite wide & this seems to be giving me the most problems, as it is wider than my previous sweeper, but I'm sure I'll get used to the maneuverability of the powerhead. Also, the hose feeds into the very bottom of the cannister (I think this  is part of the "cyclonic" design), and I often seem to be pulling the cannister up, instead of along.
The suction is impressive, and I prefer being able to dump dirt (and dog hair) as needed as opposed to waiting for a bag to fill. The prior sweeper I had was also bagless, so I'm somewhat familiar with needing to be directly over the trashcan before dumping the dusty load. This model is fairly easy to empty, but again, you need to be right over your trash container.
I like the auto shutoff feature on the powerhead (found this out when I sucked up a sock with first running!). That should save on belts in the future. The telescoping wand is a nice feature, and the cord seems to be of more-than-adequate length. 
One huge determining factor in my purchase was the 6 year warranty offered by Hoover. I realize I am still in the "honeymoon" phase, and comparing my 10 yr old Fantom with this new Hoover, but I am quite impressed so far & would recommend it at this point.

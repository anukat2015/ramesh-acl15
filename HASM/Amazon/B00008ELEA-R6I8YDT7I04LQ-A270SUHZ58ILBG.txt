Title: Farberware electric percolator
Content:
This product has definitely lost its quality. We had a Farberware percolator that lasted 15 years. It finally quit and we bought a new one expecting the same quality. The new one lasted less than 18 months. Customer service department was not helpful. It makes great coffee. But considering its cost and short life span, it's not worth it. I will not buy a Farberware electric percolator again.

Title: Overall NICE, with Pros and Cons
Content:
Pros:  Beautiful display, bright with vivid color.  Plays movies well, displays photos and holds lots of music.  Great sound, nice slide show, user interface is super and unique to iPod.  Don't waste your money on cheap Chinese knock-offs if you want good quality, buy the iPod.
Cons:  Apple should have provided a wall charger...having to leave this connected to a powered-on computer to charge is rediculous.  Apple's wall charger is outrageously priced, a good one is available for a few dollars elsewhere (get one that is micro controlled so you don't over charge the battery).  I don't like that the unit is sealed, so I cannot replace the battery or hard drive myself.  The battery lasts a long time when using as an MP3 player, but doesn't last long when watching a movie.  The instruction manual that comes with the iPod tells almost nothing...go to the Apple website and download the full manual.  Using iTunes to connect to the iPod is NOT, I REPEAT, NOT intuitively obvious.  I had to call Apple tech support to ask them how to get songs, photos and movies onto the iPod.  This was poorly thought out, a great weakness on Apple's part, the iTunes interface should be redesigned.  The folders on the iPod are hidden from the user, download an application from the internet that allows you to see what's on the iPod and allows you to take files off directly, without having to use iTunes.

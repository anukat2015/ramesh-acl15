Title: Ideal for graphics editing
Content:
Gorgeous wide screen notebook that is ideal for graphics editing.  It lacks useful features found in less expensive notebooks of comparable size (e.g. 16" HP notebooks), such as fingerprint security and hard drive auto-lock, but the faster hard drive (7200 rpm vs 5400 rpm), faster CPU and front-side bus, and additional RAM, make this Sony much more ideal for Photoshop and Lightroom use. The keyboard and touchpad are excellent.  On the minus side, it is a little pricey, it gets warmer than I would like, and its battery loses power much more quickly than I would like.  All things considered, however, it is a high quality notebook and is great-looking in chocolate brown.

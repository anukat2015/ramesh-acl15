Title: Machine that does it all
Content:
As a software developer looking for a machine that can handle the requirements of building software, and being a multi media machine, this is a great choice. The Quad Core and 4 GB or Ram handles everything with elegance. One thing I would criticize would be the HP software bundle. HP is slow in resolving their software issue which can be annoying. After removing some of them, and disabling them, I am much happier. 
Also, I run movies through an older projector that can handle 1080i, but not HDMI or encrypted digital signals. The VGA port being able to output nice 1080 equivalent saved me from needing to buy a new projector to run Blu-ray at a decent resolution. I would liked to have a optical audio port for my also legacy Bose sytem, alas the only surround sound options are HDMI, which I can't plug in. But I found a USB sound device that dealt nicely with sending my Bose surround sound. 
Play back of blu-ray on the laptop screen is beautiful, and the built in speakers with a subwoofer beneath really sound great. Maybe not enough to trully fill a room, but for watching a movie on your lap, very nice. Only issue with the screen is the high mirror like reflection making this laptop unusable outdoors or in bright light. It would not work well sitting outside a coffee shop enjoying a beautiful day. 
Overall, I am happy with this machine and consider it near perfect enough to earn 5 stars.

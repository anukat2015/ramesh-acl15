Title: 'Grind and Brew' Review
Content:
I have been using my new 'Grind and Brew' machine for about 2 weeks now and realy like its ease of use.  It's features are nice and also quite simple to use and remember. Overall one of the main reasons for my purchase of this type and brand of coffee maker was the thermal insulated carafe.  It really does what it says it will...it keeps the coffee hot! Not only does it keep the coffee hot for at least 6 hours...but it does so without compromising the taste of the coffee.  It makes an excellent tasting coffee because the brew water temperture is hot and that is key in any good coffee.

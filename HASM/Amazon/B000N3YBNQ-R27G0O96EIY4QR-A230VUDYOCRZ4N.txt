Title: Great little futuristic looking sucking machine!!
Content:
I got this vacuum for my birthday! It was in a small box. I would have never guessed it would be a vacuum!! 
Cons: 
It has a beautiful smooth orange-tan color finish. 
The handle folds down 2 times making it smaller for great storage if you are short on space. 
The handle is adjustable to your height! 
The on/off/floor buttons are right on the handle for easy reach. 
Lightweight! Weighs 21 pounds. Once you fold down the handle, there's another handle on the body of the vacuum for easy lifting. 
The cord is retractable by the easy click of your feet! It winds up very quickly into the inside of the vacuum! No messy cords to wind up outside the machine! 
It has light indicators letting you know the bag is full or the filter needs to be changed. 
The bags are easy to change. Quick and painless! 
The vacuum picks up hair on the carpet like no other vacuum! It literally sucks good! You could see the vacuum marks on the carpet telling you it's clean! 
Vacuums to the edge of the carpet real well. 
Filter lasts a long time. About a year before you change it. 
Cons: 
Bags get filled pretty quickly. Better buy bulk. 
Does not have any attachments. No hoses to use for tight spots, corners or furniture. 
Kind of hard to push but it gives you a work out! No complaints there! 
I am real happy with it. You can buy bags, filter and belt refills at Amazon easily.

Content:
What a device, This does everything, Alot reviews being- slow no way , just think it has a self motion camera- i just caught my father taking my candy from my desk. it also replace my cell phone, using my bluetooth earpiece, while i do not need to carry my nav. device, it built GPS in with no contracts, built in Verzion wireless card, no need add on to laptop, WAIT there MORE do you understand the weight, It slip into my kakis front pants, pocket. I also use this at home, i plug this tiny computer, to my 46' LCD T.V. , not saying there something wrong with it screen, it the crisp's, sharpest, screen, FOR A SMALL laptop. This amazing device need credit to it visions of taking the next step.  Just add all the devices i explain, it will cost 40% and all those devices you have to carry,and worry about power cords, adapters. SONY IS THE ONE ONLY.

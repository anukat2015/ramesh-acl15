Title: nice mp3 player...when it works
Content:
I got this thing for christmas 05 and it started crashing around june (about 5 months later).  It was a bunch of things that messed it up.  It seemed to work fine but I couldn't hear anything from my headphones.  I had to wiggle the head phone thing for it to work and it sometimes only worked when i had force on it at a certain angle.  Another problem was then when I try to charge it..it just lights up and it wouldn't charge for some reason. After noticing that I unpluged it, and the light wouldn't go out.  So I took out the battery and put it back in and it would automaticly start itself up and would freeze at the greeting "Creative" screen.  It would do that for a couple days, works for a couple days, then stop...going on and off and deciding when it would and would not work.  It's very frustrating.
Other then all the bad stuff, there are some great features that it has.  built in FM radio, microphone, calender, adjust EQ settings, phone book, and date/time (which was always wrong no matter how many times I set it) you can adjust the sensitivity of the touch pad. and there are many different play modes (repeat, normal ect..) the blue lights and screen are bright and very noticable in the dark. 
Overall...this is a good product...when it works.  and when it crashes for while...it is VERY frustrating to try to get it to work.

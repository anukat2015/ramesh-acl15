Title: This is not a red coffee pot!
Content:
I have wanted a red coffee pot since Christmas. Seems like everyone in the nation sold out. I was excited to order a red coffee pot online. Much to my disappointment, it is fuchsia or pink. It is not red at all! By the time I send it back and pay for shipping and pay for shipping for another one, I feel as though it becomes pointless and a waist. I am highly disappointed in color description and the way it appears online as it is deceiving. If you want a red coffee pot, order something else. The coffee is fine, nothing special, but it works. it perks fairly fast, not allowing much time to really absorb the coffee bean richness.

Title: Excellent product
Content:
I am surprised to see effects. Excellent camera and I am very happy with it. I have used canon products before, and I was always unhappy with their battery life, but not with this product. Xsi has lot of features and to be honest I am still learning. I used this for my NY trip and some of the pics I took during night were amazing. camera should be bought with 55-250 mm lens along with 18-55, that gives very good range for much less cost. Really worth the $$.

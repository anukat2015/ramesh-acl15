Title: Lasted less than one month.
Content:
My daughter received it for christmas and was very excited about it. However, she only had it for a month, and it quit completely. It wont charge, turn on, or do anything at all. Now we have to send it in to have it fixed. We are both very dissapointed in it. Also, I ordered an accessory set from Amazon.com and it is very poor quality. The auto charger came apart the first week. I ordered a clear snap on case as well. It doesnt even fit the ipod, and wont snap on. I am very dissapointed in everything that I purchased from Amazon. I am most definately not impressed with the ipod products.

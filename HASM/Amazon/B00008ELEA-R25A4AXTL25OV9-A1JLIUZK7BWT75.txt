Title: the best
Content:
Percolators make the best coffee.  Period.  Farberware percolators are the best percolators, therefore, they make the totally best coffee! ever. This thing is a workhorse, my old one was like 30 years old and still works (lost it in a move). It is more expensive than a MR. Coffee or some run of the mill coffee pot, but once you've had percolated, you won't go back.

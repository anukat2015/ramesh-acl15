Title: Canon 50D ...wow!!!!
Content:
50D...wow so far this camera is outperforming my expectations.
I just recently was shooting swimming event indoor,it has huge differences from my XTi .
I could play w/ISO and get very good shoots,so far I am very happy w/the camera.
I need to spend more time to get to know it and to perfect my technic w/this masterpiece.
I am semi-professional sport photographer and think this camera will stay with me for long time.

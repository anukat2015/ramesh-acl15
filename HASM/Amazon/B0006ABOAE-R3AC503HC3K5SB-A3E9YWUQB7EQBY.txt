Title: Great price, great machine
Content:
This machine has been very good so far.  It just takes a little time to make the espresso and lattes.  With the 4-shot espresso, I can make two-16 oz lattes with the water left in the tank for steaming two cups of milk after the espresso has brewed.  It's worth getting good, fresh beans to grind for the espresso or buy freshly ground espresso beans from Starbucks or local grocery store.  That makes a lot of difference in taste.  As far as some people saying the lift-out water tank leaks or is awkward, I have had no problems.  If you leave the lid down that covers the screw cap for the espresso tank, some condensation will collect and will run down the back of the machine when you open it after brewing espresso.  If it bothers you, just leave the lid up while you brew the espresso.  Not a big deal for me.  The milk steamer works fantastic and gets it very hot if you steam too long.  Just clean it off right away or you'll be scraping or scrubbing the steamer "arm" when it dries and leaves a "crust" of sorts.  All-in-all...good buy.  Get one if you aren't super picky about lattes.  I think they taste as good as any Starbucks or big coffee shop lattes.

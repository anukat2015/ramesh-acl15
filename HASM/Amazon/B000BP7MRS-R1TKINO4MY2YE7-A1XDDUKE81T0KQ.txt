Title: Best coffee pot I have owned!
Content:
The bought this model because other reviewers said its make hot coffee, and they were right. Can't stand lukewarm coffee like my old Mr. Coffee used to make. I also like the permanent cone filter--easy to clean. The glass pot is excellent; controls are simple and easy. Very happy with this purchase.

Title: What a gem!
Content:
My previous heater was a Vornado at nearly twice the price.  The Vornado died after 2 years of minimal use, and I needed a replacement.  I thought about getting a Vornado, but saw this little gem.
I am very happy I chose this one.  Not only cheaper, but very effective.  Between the thermostat heat control and the oscillation, this little guy heats up my den/office quite well.
This little guy isn't meant to be a heat blaster, but a subtle little guy that doesn't draw a huge amount of power.   The best heater for your money is one that heats using the fewest $$$ both at the cash register and in my electrical bill.
This little guy is just great!

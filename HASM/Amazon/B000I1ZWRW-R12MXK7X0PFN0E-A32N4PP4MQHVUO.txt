Title: LOVE it!
Content:
You can't go wrong with this camera! The pictures are amazing! I wish I had bought this much sooner. The only thing that held me back was the price, but in the end it's more than well worth it. Just keep in mind that you will have to do a lot of reading and playing around with the camera before you will really be good at using it. The manual it comes with is not much help in teaching you how to use the camera so be sure to buy some other Rebel XTi books to teach you the basics and even some advanced tips. It comes with a neck strap, but you will have to purchase a camera bag and extra battery to make your purchase complete.

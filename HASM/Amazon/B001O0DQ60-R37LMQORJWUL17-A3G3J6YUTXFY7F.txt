Title: Very disappointed
Content:
I thought long and hard about getting this very expensive laptop, but finally decided that its small size and reputation for quality would best serve my needs for a laptop that is large enough to store all my document files that I take with me for work, but portable enough to take with me everywhere.  Within 2 months the power button which is part of the right hinge had literally fallen off and no longer worked.  Sony advises that they will send a box for me to return it to them at which time they will wipe the hard drive, so that anything that is not backed up will be gone.  While my  documents are all backed up daily, my personal pictures are not.  They advised me that they can try to make the repair without wiping the hard drive, but no promises, and told me to "stick a little note in the box when you send it back saying you don't want it wiped."  For a cost of over $2000.00, the best they can to is tell me to put a note in the box?  What kind of outfit is this, with cheap hardware that falls apart within the first two months, and "service " that consists of little notes???? I will never buy a Sony again.

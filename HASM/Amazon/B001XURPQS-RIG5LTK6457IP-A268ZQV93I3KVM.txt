Title: Awesome camera!
Content:
This is my first SLR and I'm sooooo happy!  Before I used a decent point and shoot cam which i thought was great till i started taking pictures with this camera wow total difference from day one!  I was missing a lot of shots due to the point and shoot taking forever to decide to take the pic and now with this i'm actually getting great shots of my 2 year old who doesn't like to sit still!  She likes the picture sound and the flash makes her laugh so it's a win win situation for me.  I don't know any of the technical terms i just know that i got a great camera that came in the mail today that works wonderfully!  I have nothing to compare to since i've never used one before.  I do know the live view rocks, i took pictures of my cat and didn't use a tripod and it came out awesome so was quite pleased with that and then took pictures of my daughter and that was awesome so now the test will be this upcoming sunday at a family gathering and my daughters first christmas program at church (low lighting and all) so we'll see!  can't comment on the video have yet to try that out.
update:  the pictures at the church were awesome and I couldn't be happier with this camera.  I have gotten quite a bit of use from this camera and think this was a perfect investment in recording my daughter's memories!

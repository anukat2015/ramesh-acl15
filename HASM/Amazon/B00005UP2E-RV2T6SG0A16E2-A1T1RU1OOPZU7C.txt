Title: good choice at this price
Content:
This is a pretty good vacuum cleaner. If you have a limitted budget and your floor is covered by carpet, I can suggest this product. I know it is not the best for cleaning carpets but it works. Since it is bagless, you don't have to worry for buying bags. But its nozzle and other accessories look like toys.

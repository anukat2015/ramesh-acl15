Title: great little java maker
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker for my 86 year old mother.  I have an older version which I have been using for several years.  It is great in a one person or one coffee drinker household.  It is easy to use and is compact so it's easy to pack for a trip and does not need filters.   We both love it.

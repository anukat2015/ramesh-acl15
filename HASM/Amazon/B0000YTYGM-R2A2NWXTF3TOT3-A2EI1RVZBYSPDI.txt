Title: Excellent Coffee maker
Content:
Read all the reviews here before I purchased this 8 weeks ago.  As long as you pay attention and don't overfill the tank, or screw the carafe lid on crooked it seems to work perfect.  We have not had one issue.. (thanks to all the other reviews pointing out the idiosyncracies)  It does pour slowly, and it is difficult to tell if there is coffee in the carafe.  I would purchase this again.  It keeps the coffee hot for a few hours and that is what we wanted. No more burned tasting coffee..  So if you like starbucks coffee, don't purchase this one. It doesn't give that burned taste no matter what.

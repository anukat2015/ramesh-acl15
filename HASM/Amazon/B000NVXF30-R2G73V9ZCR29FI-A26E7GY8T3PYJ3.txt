Title: Olympus trade up program to the 510
Content:
Olympus Evolt E510 10MP Digital SLR Camera with CCD Shift Image Stabilization and 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 and 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 Zuiko Lenses
Olympus has a program to trade in your old digital camera for a new Evolt 510.  So, I traded in my year old Evolt 500 for the newer model.  I am so happy I did.  The difference in the quality of the picture and general function is day & night.  It focuses quickly and is clear, sharp and without noise.  My kids shoot semi-professionally with a Canon D-30, I feel like my 510 is more user friendly and just as good.  I thank Olympus for making the offer to help me buy the 510.  However, even without the trade in program the 510 is a very good value.

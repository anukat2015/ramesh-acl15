Title: Quite an amazing machine!
Content:
Before I start, let it be known that I am not a "photographer." I'm a beginner hobbyist at best, and I mean beginner! This is my first step into the world of high-end cameras and SLRs. Have had numerous 'automatic' film cameras and point & shoot digital cameras. I made the jump to dSLR out of frustration with the performance of my pocket cameras. I have not had this camera for even 2 weeks, but here is what I've found:
* Very good build quality.
* "Kit" lens optics are very accurate and bright.
* SPEED! Turns on and is ready to shoot almost instantly.
* Auto-focus is very fast and spot-on.
* Follow-up shots are practically immediate, and it really will shoot 3 frames-per-sec.
* Battery life is very impressive.
* Button placement and menu navigation is intuitive and smart.
* Just feels like a real camera, not too light or heavy, nice components.
I can't provide too much insight, but so far, it is clear that it will take me a long time to catch up to the camera's abilities. I've taken many shots so far, most of them rather poorly, but the level of detail that the sensor captures is really amazing, especially for people who may not know better, like me.

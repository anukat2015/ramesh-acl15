Title: Great product!
Content:
2GB, wow!  I've got about 100 songs as well as 12 audio books and there is still plenty of room left.  Easy to use, sounds great and has features I didn't think I would use, but find that I am (FM radio, and voice recorder).
I must be honest, I bought this without physically comparing at all, it just was the most bang for my buck.  I think it sounds great, but there may be others that sound better side by side.
I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and have not yet changed the battery.  I just really can't think of any complaints on this MP3 player.  I'm totally satisfied.

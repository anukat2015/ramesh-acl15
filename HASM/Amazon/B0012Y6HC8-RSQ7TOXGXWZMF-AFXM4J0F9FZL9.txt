Title: Awesome SLR Camera
Content:
Excellent digital SLR camera.  Have been using this for a month and no problems.  Picture quality is second to none (the best I've seen).  Battery life is great.  Easy to use.  I'm a dad photographer, but this is a professional camera anyone can use.  I recommend a  class 6 SDHC 8GB chip for maximum speed and capacity.

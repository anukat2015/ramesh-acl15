Title: Zune is great
Content:
I run an windows and the Zune works perfectly. My wife has a ipod and had alot of trouble at first. She had to add registry files. My Zune on the other hand loaded perfectly. Now that Zune has video content on their site, it is even better. There is a seemless integration. You also get myspace style homepage in the Zune community. I recommend this over Ipod if you have    windows OS. Plus the screen is way bigger.

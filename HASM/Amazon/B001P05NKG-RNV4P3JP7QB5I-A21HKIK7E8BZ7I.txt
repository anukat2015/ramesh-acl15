Title: Switched to the other side
Content:
I finally did it. I crossed the line and switched to a Mac. Having been a PC user all my life, the decision wasn't easy, but with so many of my friends switching to a Mac (and loving it), I decided to jump ship. Basically, everything you've heard about a Mac is true, it's faster, cooler, virus-free and aesthetically more appealing. You have to get used to the Operating System, but it wasn't too hard to adjust. There are so many cool features and I think the track pad itself has single-handedly made the mouse obsolete. The MacBook Pro is really equipped for everyday users who just want to surf the web, have fun with your pictures and basically have a reliable laptop. All that said, the only reason I switched to a Mac is because I AM just an everyday user who uses the laptop for fun. I wouldn't have switched to a Mac if I was using it for work or had still been in college (due to my Engineering background).

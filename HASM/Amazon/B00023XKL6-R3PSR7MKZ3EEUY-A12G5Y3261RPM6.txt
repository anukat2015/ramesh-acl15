Title: A joke of a product, a joke of a company
Content:
Don't buy this product, don't buy ANYTHING from Soleus.
The product:
These units have got to be some of the worst manufacturing quality I've seen in a long time. The first one arrived with internal (i.e. not shipping) damage: the swing fins were completely severed, along with a few other things.
The second unit arrived, and, (with hindsight), was assembled with damaged parts (e.g. the internal evaporative/heat/condensation fins have dents and large-impact damage all over the place), where at least some of these parts broke very quickly:
I didn't know it at the time, and now the unit is out of warranty, but: the condensation/water pump slowly got worse and worse, until now it is 100% broken:
it binds itself on power start. It is poorly designed.
Looking at the other reviews, I am guessing most units have this pump fail.
The end result is the unit turning off the AC/compressor after about 20 minutes, with the "water full" light turning on. The unit also fails to restart the compressor once the water is drained, without a power cycle.
The company:
Not only did the company refuse to send me a new part (virtually every large appliance company will at least sell to customers with a no-refund policy), they refused to list anyone in the area who could repair/order this part on my behalf. In a nutshell, they offer no support whatsoever (or even an apology) for their product, a product which is flawed to begin with.
A bogus product, a bogus company.

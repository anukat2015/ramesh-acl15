Title: Beats the Shuffle and great so far!
Content:
Had suffered with a Walkman and then a Shuffle (former too bulky and poor reception, latter no control).  This is a perfect answer with good reception from the radio;  sound very good; buds comfortable; storage more than adequate; small and attractive; very good price.  Only negatives so far are that the clip broke off and that the battery recharge is not as advertised--about 5-10 hours.  I bought a two-year replacement warranty because something this good can't last!  (I thought well enough of it, just the same, to buy two more as gifts.)

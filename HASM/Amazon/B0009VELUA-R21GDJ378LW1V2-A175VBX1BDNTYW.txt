Title: A great coffee maker
Content:
I purchased this for work to replace a different brand that kept leaking.
I have a cuisinart at home and have had virtually no problems for over 5 years.  I liked this one because it is easier to brew and clean up than conventional type coffee makers.
I cant say anything bad about this produce and I think the price is satisfactory.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it will not fit a travel mug.  You must use a regular or large coffee mug, so for the office its ideal.

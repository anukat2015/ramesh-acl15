Title: Love my Zen.
Content:
This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. Creative did an awesome job with the design. The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. I have the black one and adore it. It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal. I take mine everywhere.

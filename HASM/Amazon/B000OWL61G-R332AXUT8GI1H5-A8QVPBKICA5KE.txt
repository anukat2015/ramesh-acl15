Title: Don't buy. This item broke twice!
Content:
This KitchenAid was on my Christmas wish list two years ago. I loved the color, 14 cups for entertaining, and the fact that I could have my coffee upon waking up every morning. After 4-6 months, the internal computer went down. I would have kept it if it could still make coffee, minus the programmable feature, but no luck. As with most electronics, once the computer goes, the whole thing fails. After a lot of effort to track down the receipt, packing it up, etc. KitchenAid did send me a new one. Same story. After 4-6 months the problem occurred again. It must be a product defect. KitchenAid should stick to mixers.

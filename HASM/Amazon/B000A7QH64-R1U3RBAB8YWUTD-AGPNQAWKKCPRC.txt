Title: Crappy service and no filters that fit
Content:
I bought this unit and it performs like a champ. It works so well that I needed to buy some replacement filters. The xsb726 filter does not fit this unit. I tried to contact shark and ended up in India where I could not get a straight answer. Love the unit, but unless you want to buy it and throw it away when the filter plugs up, try something else.

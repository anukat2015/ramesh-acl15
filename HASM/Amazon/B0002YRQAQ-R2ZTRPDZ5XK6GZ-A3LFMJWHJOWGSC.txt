Title: Makes good coffee, too
Content:
.
I bought this maker because it is the only one available where I could change the position of the handle by turning it 90 degress to allow me to pour by rotating my wrist instead of bending it in an unnatural way. Pouring by rotating your wrist also allows you to avoid getting a steam burn on the back of your hand. Other pots, like the one this replaced, cannot be modified in this manner.
Makes good coffee, too.

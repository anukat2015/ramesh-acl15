Title: great improvement
Content:
This just arrived and since it was boxed, I had to put a few of the parts on it. Since I'm not great with mechanical things, it was a little bit of a challenge but not impossible.  I bought this model based on the October '08 issue of "Consumer Reports" recommendation based on both price and quality.
I just ran it through my living room and I was very surprised and pleased with its performance.  I guess I didn't know how bad my old Hoover was (about 10 years old?) until I used this. It picked up a huge amount of lint, dirt and cat hair and my dark rug looks practically brand new! And even better, it's bagless! No more spending money on expensive bags that are annoying at best.
This machine is a bit noisy but since I live in a detached home, it won't bother my neighbors as it might if I lived in an apartment.

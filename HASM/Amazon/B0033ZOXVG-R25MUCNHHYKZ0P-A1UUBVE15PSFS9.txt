Title: This heater saved me money!!!!!
Content:
I purchased a new comfort heater for my store that is 2800 sq ft because the heating bill was so outrageous last month.  I put this heater in there and set it to 72 degrees and turned the main store heater down to about 50.  I set this heater to come on at 6 a.m. so that when i got there at 9 the store would be warm and just as i wanted when i got there I surprised how the store was heated and felt great.  This is a great product and I am excited to see how low my heating bill is going to be this month.

Title: great vacuum great price
Content:
This vacuum is easy to move around and surprising light for the amount of power.  It easily fits underneath furniture and has the controls on the handle making it easy to use. It takes a bit of assembly when it arrives, but it wasn't difficult.  While not the cheapest, it is certainly cheaper than other high end vacuums and has enough features to keep me happy.

Title: does the job
Content:
Small, lightweight, great battery life, great sound quality.  Most of all, you can't beat Itunes right now for managing music, podcasts, ITunes University, audiobooks, etc, which is the reason I'm using an IPOD. For some (dumb) reason Apple decided to add a camera in the 5th generation model, unfortunate since I couldn't bring it to work! 4th generation is the optimal model in this line for that reason.  My only complaint: the clickwheel, which I realize is trendy but it has at least two inconveniences:  1) it is hard to make small volume adjustments, especially when it's in your pocket, and 2) it is hard to rewind just a little bit (like if you miss part of an audiobook) -- if you don't hit just right, you rewind the whole thing.  This is where I think other mp3 players (like sony's) have an advantage from a 'practical' point of view -- but this requires more 'buttons'-- something apple is adverse to so they often choose fashion over functionality, unfortunately.

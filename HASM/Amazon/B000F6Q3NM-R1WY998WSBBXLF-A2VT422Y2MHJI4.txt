Title: So far this is a great little heater
Content:
After several disasters with space heaters dying on me with only a limited amount of use, I decided to buy this little heater at Best Buy last year with an extended warranty. I have used it off and on for several months and now that it is getting colder again this heater is getting a workout. It is mostly used in the bathroom but I have also used it in my bedroom several times recently, which is pretty large and does get very chilly and it does a great job.
It does shut off automatically when the temperature reaches the desired setting. The casing stays really cool which is far different than the radiator heaters that I am currently trying, they get HOT to the touch. It is very light weight and for light sleepers it runs very quiet except for the light click it makes when it shuts off or comes back on adjusting to the temp change. I would say the only cons for this little heater is that there is no safety shut off if it gets knocked over and the temperature setting is a bit of a guessing game since there is no actual numbers (65 70 75 etc.) to go by. This is reasonably easy to figure out though. Overall, as of this post, I would purchase another one of these little heaters in a heartbeat.

Title: Great laptop, especially for a college student
Content:
I bought this computer mainly because of the claims made about the battery life. I am in college and my laptop goes everywhere that I do. I use a laptop to take lecture notes in all of my classes and on days when I am on campus for 5 plus hours, I really needed to step up the battery life. So, I put my HP to rest and went with this, the Asus ul50ag-A2. This particular model is great! The battery claims are correct. I have been getting easily 8 to 9 hours worth of battery life and I could get even better if I wanted to keep tinkering with the power settings. The ultra-low voltage processor runs just fine, fast enough for me!The quality of this laptop is awesome. It feels very sturdy and well-made. It looks very sleek. All black with a black brushed aluminum finish, LED screen, blue lights, and a very cool "smart-pad" mouse that blends right in with the rest of the computer. I especially love the way the smart-pad works, very much like the mouse on a Macbook, with two-finger scrolling and three-finger tapping that can be used as the right-click function (don't worry, there is also a button for right and left-clicking). So far, I have not had any problems with overheating, but the computer is still relatively new to me (the ice cool palm rest also helps). I also would like to point out that the computer is thin and light. It fits in my book-filled backpack and does not add much more weight at all. I feel safe saying that this is the best laptop I have purchased yet and I will continue to use Asus in the near future. It is easily comparable to computers in the 1000 dollar plus range.

bought this laptop a couple of days ago....WOW. its a beautiful piece of machinary..hd playback is great on its 1080p screen..
and can play all my games(including crisis) with ease.So yea i'm really satisfied with this laptop
pros:crazy good full hd screen
     great graphics card
     the feel of the keyboard is great(back lit)
     multi touch mouse pad(pitch and zoom pages)
     fast as hell!!
cons:expensive..but you get what you pay for
     fan can get loud...whine
     i wish it was a tad thinner

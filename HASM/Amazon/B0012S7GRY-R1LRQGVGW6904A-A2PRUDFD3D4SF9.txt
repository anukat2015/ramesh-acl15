Title: Best for me purchase this year
Content:
I purchased this because I ride the bus to work now and needed a distraction from the noise. Now I don't know how I did without it. I love that fact that you can not only download music, but movies,TV shows, and videos as well.  I will say though, if you want to download TV shows or  movies and pics that it would be better if you get the 60GB or 80GB nano as I only have about 300 songs on my 4GB and am running low on space.  If I added my shows on, I would not be able to have much more music. The sound quality is outstanding. Don't know why I waited so long to get one.

Title: CW18FX/B... best at low prices.
Content:
The machine is fast, good graphics card and overall performance. FSB and RAM operate at same speed, this greatly improves overall performance. Nice keyboard. Very nice screen, although I do wish the resolution was a bit higher. Very good for bussines and for games. it was a good buy, I have a great machine. Lid is a dust magnet. not really the best looking laptop, but, cost-benefit ratio is excellent. I recommend buying this laptop.

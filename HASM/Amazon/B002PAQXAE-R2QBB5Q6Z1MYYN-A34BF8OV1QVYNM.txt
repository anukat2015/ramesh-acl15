Title: LIGHTWEIGHT, LONG BATTERY LIFE AND FAST - I LOVE IT!!!!
Content:
Beats the competition by a mile.  If you can still get in on the $75 gift card promotion from Amazon, don't hesitate to hit the "buy" button.  Super fast and the screen resolution is phenomanal.  Why waste your $'s on a 10 or 11.6" with a slow Atom processor?  Weighs just 6 ozs more than most 10" netbooks.
Still looking for a suitable bag to carry the UL20a, portable drive and mouse.  If anyone has found something (besides a backpack and preferably thru Amazon) that's light and doesn't cram everything in like a sardine, please post the info.
A happy camper on this purchase.

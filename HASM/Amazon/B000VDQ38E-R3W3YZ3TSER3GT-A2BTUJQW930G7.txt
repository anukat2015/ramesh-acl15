Title: Less than impresses
Content:
I read lots of reviews before deciding to buy the Pet Hair Eraser ($150 12/08) upright vacuum. Our Bissell Powerforce ($45 08/07) was only meant to be a temporary replacement for our Hoover WindTunnel V2 that bit the dust before vacation in August '07. Based on those great, positive reviews I thought I was buying a better cleaning machine, but so far have not been impressed by it's ability to erase pet hair.
It has no more suction than our model that cost 1/3 of the price and I do not see a difference in the amount of pet hair that is picking up. The "eraser" on the front of the machine is like an old lint brush. It's in the way when it's up - preventing one from getting under furniture - and when it's down it doesn't get up to the edge of the walls. The smaller attachments have silicone on the bottom. They are the only part of the cleaner I like, but they aren't perfect. They seem to help get the hair off the stair treads, but it's still a slow and painful process.
I know it's winter, and the air is really dry and full of static, but everytime we empty the dirt cup we have to sweep the floor again. Our kitchen has indoor/outdoor carpet with little or no padding under it. The vacuum practically walks across the floor and doesn't seem to pick up anything - and I can't get under the toe kick of the base cabinets.
We have 60 days from our date of purchase to return it. As much as I hate to, I think we have to get our money back and go back to the Powerforce. It was cheap, but it works decently.

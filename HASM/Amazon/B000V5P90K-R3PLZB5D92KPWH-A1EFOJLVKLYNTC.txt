Title: Just get it
Content:
I shoot professionally full time specializing in advertising and weddings.  When I got into advertising I was unsure if this 40d would produce a big enough file to accommodate billboards.  I've been proven wrong.  
10.1 megapixels is sufficient for full sized billboards.  For weddings, in my experience anything larger than this file size would be overkill for the type of prints wedding couples want produced.  
The color accuracy has amazed me as well as the endless list of custom functions.  You can truly trick this camera out to suit your individual shooting style.
The body is rugged... I don't make a habit of dropping my gear like a schmuck, but if that is your disposition then you will appreciate the magnesium alloy body.
The size fits nicely in big hands and the weight is ideal over larger cameras such as the Mark II series which I have had the pleasure of shooting with.
I will not be upgrading to the new 50d.  I will instead be upgrading to the new 5d mark II once that comes out.  Only for my own gluttonous reasons though.  
Take my word.  This beast will serve you well!

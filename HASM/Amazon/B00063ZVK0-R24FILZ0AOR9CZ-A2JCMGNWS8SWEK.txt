Title: Arrived dead
Content:
After doing tons of research and dismissing the competitors on grounds of heating cords and melting bodies, I picked this Vornado. From reading the reviews here I knew it was a gamble. Well, here you go, I lost. The unit came brand new, unopened and dead. There were no signs of physical damage or such. The LCD screen was working, but the unit never moved a bit of air.
Returned it and don't plan on getting a new one, too much hassle.

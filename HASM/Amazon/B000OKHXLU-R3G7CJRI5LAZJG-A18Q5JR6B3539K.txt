Title: THIS IS NOT AN AIR CONDITIONER, PEOPLE!!
Content:
This is NOT an air conditioner and WILL NOT WORK if the humidity is above 38%!!!  The DRIER THE BETTER.  Read the instructions and do some research on Personal Air Coolers/Portable Swamp Coolers or whatever you want to call them.  The low ratings aren't because the thing doesn't work.  The low ratings are because people bought this thing and it didn't work FOR THEM in THEIR LOCATION and they aren't satisfied because they made a poor decision and want to blame it on someone or something.

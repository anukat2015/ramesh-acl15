Title: I love this item
Content:
I bought this item to replace my original Zen micro. I am very pleased with how amazing this product is. The sound is great although I use different ear buds than those that are packaged with it.  I have had this product alomst a year now with absolutley no complaints or issues. Uploading music is a snap using windows media player or the creative program that comes with it. I would highly reccommend this product for any age its pretty rugged too Ive dropped mine on sevral occasions with no damage. Overall an incredible value and worth every cent!

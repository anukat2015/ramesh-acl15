Title: serves the needs
Content:
Great product. Using in the baby room that is above the garage(not insulated). We have central air but the room used to be very cold with this heater it's a paradise! Use on the low heat and low fan settings and it's very warm in the 18x20 8 feet ceilings. Almost no noise. Doesn't bother the baby - makes a white noise helps to sleep better.
Highly recommend.
Will buy another one for our patio room.

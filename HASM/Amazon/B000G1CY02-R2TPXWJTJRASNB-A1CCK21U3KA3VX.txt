Title: It quit working
Content:
Within the first year of use I would give the heater glowing reviews.  Unfortunately after 1.5 years (1 season of use) the heater has quit working.  The manufacture date on the unit is 2007.  I called DeLonghi and they will do nothing.  That's it, ninety bucks down the drain.  I will not buy a DeLonghi again.

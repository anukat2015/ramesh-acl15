Title: Nice, but not all the way there
Content:
I just received my zune, and here's my first comments:
Things I liked:
- small size
- big screen
- album art. this is definitely something that stands out from the ipod and creative zen. the album art takes up most of the screen when the song is playing. also, when you're scrolling by artist, you can see the cover art of the albums.
- movie mode goes sideways, so you can really take full advantage of the large screen.
- when the movie mode goes sideways, the navigation controls feel very well positioned
- navigation is easy to use
- fm radio has meta data associated to the stations, like XM. You get the station name, title of the song, etc. pretty sweet.
- when playing music, you can navigate around and keep the music playing.
- totally irrelevant, but the packaging is definitely an award winner 
Things I didn't like:
- most importantly, the sound was not very good. it seemed very muttled. I used my mp3s, i used the preloaded mp3s on the zune, i used the included earphones, my headphones, and I plugged it into my stereo. nothing sounded great. I pulled out my Archos MP3 player and compared the same MP3 song (dave mathews), and the Archos was much better sounding. I changed the equalizer's preset settings, and no matter what, the sound wasn't that great. This was very disappointing, and for this reason, I'm probably going to return the zune. 
- to use it, your computer must have SP2 or it won't work. I heard it doesn't work with vista either. Not sure what msft was thinking.
- no power supply included. it get's it's power from the usb port. although this seems to be standard with mp3 players right now, I think it's ridiculous. Power adapters cost $30 more.
- no manual. again, although this seems to be the standard with other mp3 players right now, I think it's ridiculous.
- can't use the device as a hard drive. Not really a big deal, but my archos can do this
hopefully this is input is helpful.

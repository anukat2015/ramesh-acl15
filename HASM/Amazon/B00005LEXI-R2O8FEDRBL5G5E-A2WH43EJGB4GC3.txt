Title: The Mr. Heater was great.
Content:
Mr. Heater preformed better than that I had expected. A friend and I took it ice fishing in our two man Ice Fishing Tent and we were kept nice and warm, even were able to heat up some food using aluminum foil. We found it really nice to be able to shut it off and turn it back on when we wanted to. I would recommend the Mr. Heater to any one who needs a portable heat source.

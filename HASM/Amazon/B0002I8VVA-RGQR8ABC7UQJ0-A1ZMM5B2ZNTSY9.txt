Title: Thought it was great until...
Content:
it would no longer turn on.  The customer service is atrocious at best, bordering on non-existent.  When my player would no longer turn on, I followed the instructions and sent it back to the service center with a note describing the problem.  Well, they have had the unit since Jan. 18 and still no sign of it.  After being given misleading information over several calls, I was finally told that I would have to wait until Mar 14 before they will negotiate a 'buy back' price with me.  Adding insult to injury, they make the customer responsible for keeping track of the progress of the repair (no callbacks or e-mail notifications available).  I hope you all can benefit from my painful experience.  Do not buy anything from RCA/Lyra; it is not worth the risk.

Title: Tools are annoying
Content:
I have had the Miele Pisces S5280 for several months and I have found the turbro brush and floor brush equally are annoying. The turbo to begin with takes a lot of muscle power to push it which I could live with but after doing one rug the brush is so tangled with hair and dirt I have to cut it away. I live alone so not much traffic, have a dog that is a non-shedder but does leave puffs of "wool", but I have had Electroluxes and have never had this problem. I would try to upgrade the brushes but I found this model one must go to battery. Talk about digressing. I would not recommend this Miele if you have a dog, long hair, a hairy husband, and don't take shoes off at the door.

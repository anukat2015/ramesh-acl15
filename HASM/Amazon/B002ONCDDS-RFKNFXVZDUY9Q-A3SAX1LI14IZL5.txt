Title: light weight, cool design, fast performance
Content:
This lap top is cost effective, provides great performance and has a smooth design. Love the new layouts and the feel of the key board. The touch pad is improved and very sensitive (guess I have to get used to it) but I love that it has a button right next to it to shut it off. I like also that the touch control for the volume. 
I am completely satisfied with this product.

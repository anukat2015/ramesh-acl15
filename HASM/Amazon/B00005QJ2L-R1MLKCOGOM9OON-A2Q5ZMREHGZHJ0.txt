Title: Great value for money
Content:
I'm not much into games and use my PC's mainly for business applications. For this purpose, the notebook is great value for money. The graphics is good, network connectivity is a snap (literally), it's fast, reliable, quiet and easy to carry around. I just ordered a wireless LAN card for it so I can use it anywhere in our house to access the internet or the other PC's.

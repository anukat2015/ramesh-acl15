Title: Don't Buy!
Content:
I thought this would be a great product to use to clean up pet hair and use on stairs. Wrong! The canister to hold the "dirt" is way too small, you have to empty it with each room! Also when you empty the "dirt" canister, it gets all over everything so if you have allergies to dirt, etc. this will definitely be a problem! The filter is hard to keep clean and the switch is messing up on me already after 2 years. It's just a very messy vacuum cleaner. I guess you "get what you pay for"! I'm going back to a bagged vacuum.

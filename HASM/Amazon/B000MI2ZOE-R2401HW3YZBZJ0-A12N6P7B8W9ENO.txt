Title: Totally worth the money!
Content:
This air conditioner definitely does what it says it does.  It cools very quickly and is fairly compact.  Pretty powerful for the size. Simple and easy to set up.  
The first unit that arrived was damaged during transit. This is the only real downfall in ordering this machine from Amazon.  The air conditioner is shipped in the same box that you would get it in if you purchased this from a brick and mortar store.  So, if the shipping people decide to drop it, the unit stands a very good chance of being damaged.
I did have to return the first air conditioner.  Amazon was very quick to replace it. The second one arrived without any damage whatsoever.
Both units were brand new.  They weren't refurbs nor were they returns.
The only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars is the shipping damage issue though that has nothing to do with this product's performance.  But we were in the middle of a massive heat wave, my house air conditioner broke (!) over Labor Day weekend and waiting a couple more days for a working unit was agonizing.  (yes, we are still waiting for the repairperson to fix our home ac.)
All in all, I'm quite pleased with my purchase and yes, I would recommend this product!

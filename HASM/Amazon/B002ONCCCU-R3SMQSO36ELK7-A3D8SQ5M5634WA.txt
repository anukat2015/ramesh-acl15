Title: HP G60 review
Content:
The machine's main advantage is as a movie viewer. The image is clean and sharp.
It has a few disadvantages the main being that the keyboard, supposedly touch pad misses out letters on the screen. My other laptop is a dated IBM Thinkpad (which I am using now) and the key board outshines the new HP. 
I also use the computer with a head set for Skype. Again the sound quality, particularly on the part of the recipient is poor. The old IBM is far superior. 
Whether the HP G60 is good for you will depend upon your needs. If you require traditional computer functions such as keyboard for word etc, it does not match up to my expectations. If you want it more as an entertainment center, then it as an improvement on my previous model.
I guess my ten year old daughter won out. She uses it all the time to watch "Merlin", whilst I am still banging the keybord on the old IBM!

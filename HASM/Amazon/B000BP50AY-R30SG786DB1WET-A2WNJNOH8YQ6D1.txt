Title: Great for the Non-Techie Who's Outdated Too
Content:
This is my first ever MP3 player which I bought so I can have some music while I exercise.  I've been online almost a decade and in my 30's.  I don't own a cell phone, and I just upgraded to Win XP in 2007.  
Where I'm not a complete idiot in the world of technology, I'm a good many steps behind the latest, best, and most expensive equipment / software.    With all this in mind, I was very impressed with this MP3 player.  Directions would have been nice, but once I rebooted the computer and plugged it in again so the PC would recognize that the player was attached, putting the songs in was extremely easy.  If you can deal with any basic digital camera, you can use this.  It opens up folders and you simply drag and drop your music into the folders.  From there, it stores them on your player.  The menus can be accessed by playing with the buttons and it didn't take me but a few minutes to check to be sure it was working with the FM radio. 
The sound was really impressive to me.  Remember I'm behind and have never been plugged into an IPod so I could be easily impressed.  However, I thought it sounded great.  
I don't like the ear buds, but the sound actually seemed fine in them.  My reason for disliking them is purely personal that ear buds in general don't fit in my ears quite right.  I take my chances with the outdated style earphones, and the player took them just fine in replacement.
All in all for a first MP3 player and a cheap way to tote music for exercise or to do what I did and join the 20th century (not a typo) then I suggest giving it a try.

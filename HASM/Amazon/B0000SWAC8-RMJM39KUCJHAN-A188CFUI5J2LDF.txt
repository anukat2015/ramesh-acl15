Title: Good for carpets, not for hardwood
Content:
After the  Electrolux vacuum that was handed down from me from my mother finally crapped out, I decided to buy another Electrolux because the last one lasted 20 years.  I didn't realize at the time that the oxygen is made by a totally different company.  Well, I am fairly disappointed in this vacuum and I guess $400 doesn't get you much these days.  While the power head is fine on carpet, it is too bulky and clumsy for hardwood floors, which is 80% of my house surfaces.  When I switch to the hardwood attachment, it "pressure-fits" on, which means there is nothing to lock it into place.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I AM CLEANING HARDWOODS, the hardwood attachment will fall off and I will have to crawl under a bed, or a dresser, or the TV stand to retrieve it.   When I first got the vacuum, I thought I might be missing a piece that would connect the handle to the attachment....this vacuum just doesn't make sense!!

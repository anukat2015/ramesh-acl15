Title: Works great!!!
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker in Oct.08 refurbished with 1yr. mfg. warranty for $89.-- and it is doing an excellent job. No problems what-so- ever so far, and we use it a couple times a day.
Coffee taste great, stays warm for quite a while, and everything works as it should.  
Don't think I would have paid full retail for a new one, but the price was right for the reburbished one, and I consider it a great bargain.

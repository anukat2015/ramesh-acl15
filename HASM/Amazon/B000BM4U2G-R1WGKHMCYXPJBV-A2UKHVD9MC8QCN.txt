Title: Excellent MP3 Player
Content:
To begin, the Zen Micro Photo is nothing short of amazing. I love it. It's sleek, compact, and stylish. One thing that really got me was the fact that it has 8GB of space; thats a Nano killer right there.
Pros
1. The Zen Micro Photo is wonderfully small and compact. Very sturdy build.
2. The fact that it has 8GB of space is great.
3. The OLED screen is beautiful, and the blue light that runs around the edge is pretty cool when it lights up.
4. This thing has a pretty good battery life depending on the way you use it. Mine usually last around 10-12 hours. And the batteries are replaceable, big ipod killer again.
5. Fast transfer of music to player (depending on the kind of computer you have)
6. Sound quality is excellent..... The preset EQ's are OK.
Cons
1. To begin, the touch pad is very very touchy, meaning that you have to be careful how you touch it because it can react to the slightest thing... but you can set the sensitivity. Also you practically have to smash the play/pause button to get it to react(minor complaint); there's a trick to it, you kinda have to slide your finger across the play/pause button.
2. The OLED screen is difficult to see in sunlight (minor complaint).
3. This is my only big complaint but it's kind of a user/product conflict. When transfering music to the mp3 player, if you don't want your music all jumbled up, the mp3 tags may need to be organized. To organize the tags is a lengthy process. You may have to go into the organizing program and rename artists, songs, etc.....

1. Don't really know when I'm gonna be using that FM radio

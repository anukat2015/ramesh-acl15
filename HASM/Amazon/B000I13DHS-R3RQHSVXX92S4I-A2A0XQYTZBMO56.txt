Title: Where's the Energy Savings
Content:
This product is an average heater, good for a small room but I did not notice a difference in the power use.  I think kinda deceptively, the energy savings on this unit is the fact that it shuts off automatically after 4 hours, thus saving you energy, kinda false logic since it's pulling the same as a heater.  My point, just buy a heater with a timer, not this unit.

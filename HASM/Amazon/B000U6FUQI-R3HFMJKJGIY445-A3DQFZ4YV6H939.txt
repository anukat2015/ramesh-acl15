Title: pretty good
Content:
I like the cleaner...mostly. It seems to have a narrow area in the front where you have to "aim" it at the dirt in order to pick it up. Not impressed with the edge cleaning feature. Really like how it gets under and around furniture, etc. Also like that it's cordless, and easy to push and turn on.

Title: Not great
Content:
This replaced a capresso coffee maker I'd owned for 10 years.  I loved my cappresso, but am not about to drop $200+ on a new coffee maker (yet).
Cons: 
I think I was spoiled by the ergonomics of the capresso, and here are some of my gripes:
1) The water fill meter needs more than 2 cups in the reservoir before it starts to bubble up to give you an accurate view of how much water you've put in.
2) replacing the filter requires you to swivel the water spout in and out of the way.
3) #4 paper filters don't fit exactly - i just think you're being really anal retentive if you feel like you need to cut down your filters.
4) the carafe has a lot of flimsy pieces that I'm sure will break or get lost before too long.
5) the carafe doesn't do a good job of pouring the coffee out at a good rate.
6) I make 4 cups at a time - coffee could be hotter, but i can' complain, because the cappresso didn't really make the coffee hot either.
7) I am annoyed that the carafe drips
8) it's awkward pouring water into the reservoir
Pros: 
1) Everything's pretty compact and tidy - less moving parts means less of the potential for mess with coffee grinds.
2) easy to clean.
3) controls are easy to use.

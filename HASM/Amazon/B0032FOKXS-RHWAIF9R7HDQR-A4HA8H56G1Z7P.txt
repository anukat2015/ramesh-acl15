Title: NABR (Not Another Boring Review)
Content:
Hi everybody,
So as the title says I am going to make a review slightly different of the other ones. 
I think that everything has been said on this laptop and that it is obviously a great hardware mixed with the perfect size and weight and a crazy battery life (10hrs 10.5 hrs seems to be the real number).
My review will focus on an single point : the color and differences between UL30VT-A1 and UL30VT-X1
So I will just say that I bought the UL30VT A1 (which is only on silver) because of the better battery even if I was preferring the black model. I've waited for the laptop and finally after one or two days I definitively rather the black one. So I am going to return it and get the X1,the X1 got the same specs minus the battery (4400 instead of 5600 I think), actually you will lose probably 1 or 2 hrs of battery and you still got between 6 and 8 hrs of autonomy.
To conclude if you got a hesitation between the :beautiful black one" and the "bigger autonomy silver one" I will advice you to take the black. In the worst case you can always buy the 5600 mah battery separately !.
P.S. : I found like the best skin cover for the back of the screen

I think it will just look fabulous and I am so excited to see it on my future ul30vt-x1 :D. (and if you ask why I don't put this on my A1 to get it black its because you will still have the silver keyboard).

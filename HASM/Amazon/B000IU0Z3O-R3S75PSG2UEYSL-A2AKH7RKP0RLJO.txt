Title: Does the job, but wouldn't buy again
Content:
It's not a bad vac, and it does the job.  Power is sufficient for light duty.  Using it is a bit inconvenient: flips to easily, not enough attachments.  The bags are very small, need to be replaced after each cleaning.  Not suitable for carpet cleaning.  I keep it and use it, but when it breaks, I'll buy another model.

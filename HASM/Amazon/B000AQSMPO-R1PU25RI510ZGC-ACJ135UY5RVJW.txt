Title: ONE WORD: CRAP!
Content:
want a coffee maker that works? then look elsewhere. i have bought many coffee makers, expresso machines, and NEVER had one NOT work, or work randomly, or when it feels like it like this one. 
press medium cup, get small cup. turn on, it turns itself off after 2 minutes. and this after 2-3 weeks. unforunately i bought this as a gift in early dec. and problems started in mid-jan. too late to return!
next time follow all the neg. reviews and your gut. when any product has 50+ 1 stars it is because it has many issues, so avoid, avoid, avoid!

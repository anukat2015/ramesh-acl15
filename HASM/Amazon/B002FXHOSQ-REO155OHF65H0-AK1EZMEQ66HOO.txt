Title: Coffee House Quality Coffee
Content:
My old Krups coffee maker died after almost 11 years of use which was quite sad since it made really, really good coffee.  Since my first one lasted so long, I wanted to stay with Krups, and this one seemed perfect for me.   I wasn't sure about the duo filter thing at first, but it really does improve the taste of the coffee, and I bought some extras since they weren't very expensive and last 3 months each.  
I will say after having it almost a month, that it makes excellent coffee.  As good as, if not better than my old one and is much faster brewing a full pot.  I've also tried the "aroma" setting used for making a partial pot and the result is much stronger coffee, which can be a good thing.  
The only complaint I have, as others have mentioned, filling the reservoir can be difficult since the fill slot is very small.  Coupled with the fact that Krups carafes tend to dribble you can end up with a mess.  Have a towel under the pot when you're pouring to soak up the spill.
The lid doesn't come off the carafe which is a minor pain when washing, and also has a gap between the lid and handle, so be careful where you put your thumb when pouring coffee as the steam can scald you.  
One last thought:  I bought the Krups 049-33 Gold Tone Filter which was suggested with the maker which worked fine, but let too much coffee particles into the pot resulting in cloudy coffee.   This may not bother some, but I went back to paper filters.

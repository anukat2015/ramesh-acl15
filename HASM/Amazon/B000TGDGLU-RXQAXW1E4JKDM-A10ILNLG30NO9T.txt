Title: Excellent product - highly recommend
Content:
This is the 2nd DeLonghi oil-filled heater I've purchased and I've been nothing but satisfied. We're heating an 18x12 room (with 14ft vaulted ceilings), and we seldom have to turn the control past the first couple of temp levels (this is in Minnesota!) - it really kicks out the heat. We always use the ComforTemp setting, which was part of the decision to buy this model - it helps save energy and costs. The unit is lightweight and easy to use, with simple controls. It's a great option instead of running your home furnace all the time - no noise, or hot air blowing on you - and it's reduced our electricity bill. You can use this unit right out of the box - no set up or assembly needed. Amazon sells it at a great price (I found the exact model for up to $25+ more).

Title: Simple and hot!
Content:
We have always wanted a thermal carafe coffeemaker and have reviewed a few. We were at Bed, Bath, and Beyond and saw this one on sale. I have to say we are very pleased with it. We have had this coffeemaker for about 2 months now. The coffee is piping hot and the double wall carafe keeps the coffee hot for up 4 hours (i did a little test) at the 4 hour mark you can still see steam coming off the coffee and is hot, but its not piping hot like when you first make it. The overall built is sturdy and the carafe is feel nice and solid. The functioning is simple and I do not have a problem with the lid at all. Its stays nice and sealed (no spills). We use #4 paper filter and not the gold reuseable filter just because little coffee bits rest on the bottom of the coffee pot. With the #4 paper filter we have no problem with that. I gave this coffee maker 4 stars because one thing I don't like is that it beeps when the coffee is done brewing and ready to drink. I wouldn't mind one beep, but it beeps 5 loud beeps. It can get annoying. Overall, I recommend this coffeemaker.
BTW - We drink coffee about every other day. we are not coffee crazy people. so I would say this coffeemaker is perfect for us.

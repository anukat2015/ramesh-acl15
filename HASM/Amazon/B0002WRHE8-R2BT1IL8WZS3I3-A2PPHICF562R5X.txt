This is the second Big Buddy heater I have gotten. We have short but cold power outages in my area and this heater does a great job in maintaining the house temperature at a comfortable level until the power and the furnace come back on. It's also convenient because it can easily be moved from room to room and I also use it in my garage when working on projects. I bought a second one for my daughter and got her the hose with the quick disconnect and regulator for safer operation indoors since they tell me that the pressure in the hose is only 1/2 psi pressure.

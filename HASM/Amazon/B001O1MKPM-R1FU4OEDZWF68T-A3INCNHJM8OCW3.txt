Title: Going Fast!!!
Content:
I bought this laptop a year ago. Returned it FAST. I could not see the keys, even during the day, and I have 20/20. The keys were dark bronze on a shiny light bronze keyboard. I bought the dv7-1232nr by HP. LOVE IT!!! Almost the same computer with black on silver. That was the one I originally picked out but was accidentally handed the bronze. HP must have realized that this was a glitch because all the laptops in Bronze released after, that either had black, or white letters on the bronze keys.

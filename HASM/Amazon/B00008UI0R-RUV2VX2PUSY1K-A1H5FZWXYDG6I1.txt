Title: bad-fitting wand to power nozzle causes one-way vacuuming
Content:
This is what could have been an excellent product, both in design and performance, however, a flaw in either enginineering or manufacturing caused power in the power nozzle to fail when vacuuming in reverse. Hoover, after much wrangling and three representatives, finally agreed to replace (rather than repair) the brand-new unit as there are NO New Jersey repair outlets and it is impractical to ship back to original place of purchase.
As well, there are several smaller rubber pieces such as the gasket-type fitting where the power cord winds back into the unit, which fell off with ordinary wear (first use!). It is not a Japanese or German product, which I am sorry to say could mean unexpected trouble these days. We expect more from Hoover and the good ol' USA products.

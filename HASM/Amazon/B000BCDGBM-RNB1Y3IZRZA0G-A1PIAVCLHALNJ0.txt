Title: A great heater!
Content:
We've used this in our 12x20 basement office for about two months now. I tend to hog it, positioning it so it heats my side of the office first, because I'm cold-sensitive. We run it probably 12-15 hours per day, most days, since at least one of us works from home each day. This is by far the coldest room of the house in the winter, so I'm very impressed with how this little heater's held up. We've had no problems with this unit and it heats the room very well. I'd definitely recommend it for purchase.

Title: Another great Sansa product
Content:
This is the 6th Sansa MP3 player I've purchased.  I've bought larger capacity, newer versions for myself, my husband, and our daughter as they've come out.  Every single one has been worth everything paid for them.  In fact, I don't think there's a better brand of MP3 player on the market.  I'm not into buying the latest gadget from Apple.  Too much money for not enough performance.  So, the Sansas are perfect.
The sound is great on it.  Syncing files is easy.  There's more than enough space on it for what I need.  I've found all of our Sansas to be durable.  We still have all 6 of our purchases.  Only one shows any mechanical difficulties, and it's 3 years old.  While still playable, the volume control doesn't work anymore.
As for the cons of the Fuze, I only have two:  1.  The in-box user information is virtually nonexistent. This leads to #2:  The volume controls are impossible to find without help.  There is no button.  I looked in the settings, and the only choices were "Normal" and "High."  Even on High, I couldn't hear my music.  I was just about to return the product when I did an Internet search.  I learned that the scroll wheel adjusts volume once a song is playing.  Now, everything works just fine.  If there had been instructions in the box, the frustration would have been nonexistent. 
Those are relatively minor annoyances, though.  I love the size (capacity and physical) of the device.  I love its ease-of-use.  I love my past experience with this company.  I would definitely buy another, and recommend it.

Title: Husband loves coffee
Content:
Cuisinart Thermal Automatic Coffeemaker
My husband drinks weak coffee all day and evening.  He like the thermos part of this maker.  It keeps the coffee hot for hours. Freshly brewed coffee is very hot but not continually heating, a major factor for him.  
This is our 3rd cuisinart thermal coffeemaker, original at home, one for out of town and this one for back up.  These coffee makers last a very long time.  We have had the original for over 10 years.    
We have also experienced problems with a few coffee grounds stopping up the flow and flooding the counter top.  To solve the possible mess, I place the coffee maker on a oblong glass dish with low sides - in case this happens.  Clean up can still be a problem, however it is localized.  The plus's outweight the negatives by 99% in our opinion.

Title: leaks, leaks, leaks
Content:
Terrible product design.  Ruined my countertop. Stained my light oak cabinets. Leaked all over my floor, filled a drawer and ran down the front of solid oak cabinets.  Dark streaks Stained won't come out and countertop is buckled and has to be replaced.  Still waiting for a satisfactory reply from Hamilton Beach.
Initially was told it was a bad gasket.  Now am being told it was the screws on bottom of pot.  Either way, it is a defective product.

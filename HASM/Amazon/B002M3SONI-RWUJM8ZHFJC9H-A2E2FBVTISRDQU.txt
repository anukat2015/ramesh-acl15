Title: Don't purchase if you plan to use while working out!
Content:
Worked beautifully until I took it to the gym.  Randomly skipped songs, froze, and kept repeating playlist names after an hour of heavy cardio.  The moisture indicator WAS NOT ACTIVATED.  The device itself never got wet.  Not sure what happened, but attempted to restore through iTunes and received the same results.  I'm an Apple person through and through, but this is a huge disappointment.

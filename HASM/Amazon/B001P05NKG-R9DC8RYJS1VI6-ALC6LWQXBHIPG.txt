Title: I am a Mac Fan
Content:
I have been using Macs for almost 2 years now and this iteration is just enjoyable.
Not too much more to add what others said but I am quite happy with my purchase.
The battery life is great (3 to 5 hrs) with decent use and the trackpad is a joy to use.
If youhaven't gotten one by now, what are you waiting for???

Title: Happy, happy, joy, joy...
Content:
I was putting off buying these. The price came down to 300. I wanted the blue one. Was hemming and hawing then finally decided I wanted it. Put it in my cart, to think on. 20 minutes later it was out of stock. Screamed, ranted and went looking for another. Found a red one for 430. Another Blue one for 430 and then the black for 299. Jumped on it like a duck on a june bug. Was not going to make the same mistake twice. 
Cons: it IS a fingerprint magnet. But then, who cares? 
Pros: it is a great piece of kit. My Macbook at just at 2 hours run time, hasn't been picked up since I got this thing at the end of November (2009). I have been on it 5 plus hours at a time, with plenty of battery left over. 
I wouldn't slam down on the keyboard, there is some give. But I wouldn't slam down on a keyboard of a laptop costing 10 times as much either.
Ordered, but have not received the Win 7 upgrade. Waiting on any kind of system update load for that. 
Added the extra memory. Didn't have any idea what I was doing, so it took me about 10 minutes. Now have 4 gig.
Easy peasy, lemon squeasy. 
The thing is quick, agile, thin and nice looking. Weighs nothing. No issues watching videos. I get reflections, but I adjust the angle. Wifi seems quite sensitive as well. 
All I can think of. 
Would buy (especially for the same price!) it again in a heart beat.

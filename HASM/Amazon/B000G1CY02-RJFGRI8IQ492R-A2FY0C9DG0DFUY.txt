Title: Home heater
Content:
We use this wonderful heater in our 24' X 10' sunroom which has 3 glass walls. We tried and returned serveral other heaters before finding this one meets all our requirements. The heater warms up quickly and enables us to keep the room comfortable even when the temperature outside is in the 20s. Have not yet experienced temperature in the teens or less, but I would bet it would still be comfortable. Best of all we have it connected to a timer which automatically goes on at night to keep the temperature above freezing so the numerous plants we have in the room do not freeze.

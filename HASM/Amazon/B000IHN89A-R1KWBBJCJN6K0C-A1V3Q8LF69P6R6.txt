Title: short and sweet
Content:
My previous camera was a non-digital Canon Rebel.  Needing a creative arts class credit, I took a digital photography class and shot with a borrowed Nikon D70.  After reading these reviews and other online reviews, the camera I purchased was the Pentax K10D and I am very pleased with my choice.  This camera, although a little heavier, is top of the line!

Title: A knockout
Content:
I had a $400 credit and 10 percent off coupon at a national chain store and bought one of these for my wife for Christmas. She is a talented amateur that's had training behind the camera so she knows what she's doing. She may use this to have another career after retirement. All her gear from her 35MM Canon camera works on this one.
This comes with a lot of software that allows you to do just about anything to make your pictures perfect, if they weren't already perfect when you shot them. Unlike those tiny little digitals, this one is full size and has a full size viewfinder and all the other technical gadgetry featured in the product description. One small drawback: the unit does not come with a memory stick. You'll have to get one elsewhere.
The 8.0 megapixels of power bring outstanding results for a first time or 1000th time user. I bought my wife's camera for $419, the most outstanding bargain I've gotten this century. Even if you pay full price or close to it for yours, you will never regret your decision.

Title: Pet Hair Eraser does what it says!
Content:
This vacuum took an amazing amount of hair and dirt out of rugs we thought were clean already from vacuuming with our old Eureka. They looked like new! Works great on wood and tile floors too. And for a price WAY less than a Dyson.
It has a good length of hose for an upright (it's set up so all the suction goes through the hose at all times) and has a great hose attachment with a rubber face to pull pet hair off of furniture fabric and curtains.
 The weight and size of the machine is definitly not ultra-light but I'm willing to compromise for a vacuum that works so well. All in all I would give an excellent rating for the Bissel 3920 Pet Hair Eraser and recommend it for anyone with pets.
Pros:
- Sucks up pet hair like no other vacuum I've used
- Has great attachments for taking pet hair off of furniture
- Good length of hose and electrical cord
- Easy to empty
- HEPA filter for exiting air
- All  attachments have places to fasten and travel with the vacuum if desired
Cons:
- Somewhat heavy and loud - I think these two gripes might be inaviodable for the amount of suction you get from this machine
- Tall - I'm 6' tall so I can't say if it would be an issue for someone shorter

Title: Great Heater
Content:
I was very pleased with this purchase. I moved to a unit that had a broken electric floor heater in it and since I live in Northern MI I needed a heat source. When I turned this on the first time I was stunned at how much heat it put out. It heats the whole bathroom in a few minutes. The price is not a reflection of the quality. I think it might even be able to heat a small bedroom. And since it is portable I may try it in my bedroom when the temp is below zero this winter. I highly recommend this heater. It is easy to operate and causes no power surges while operating.

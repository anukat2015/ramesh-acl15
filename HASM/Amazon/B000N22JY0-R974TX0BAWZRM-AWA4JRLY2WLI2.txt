Title: Good heater, too bad it beeps so loudly
Content:
I got the Lasko as supplemental heating for my kid's room. It has a lot of good features, and the fan is whisper quiet. But then the unit beeps incessantly and I can't shut the beeping off. I'll have to repack it and send it back; that's a deal breaker for me. I can't be waking up my kid just to change the temperature setting. I have an older (louder) heater and my kid can sleep through its fan noise, but this beeping... too bad. I liked the heater otherwise, and if you are indifferent to are like the beeping, then this is a great fan.

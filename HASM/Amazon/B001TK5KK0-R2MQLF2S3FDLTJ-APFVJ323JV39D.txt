Title: Pro Ebiz Llc: 8gb New Generation mp3 mp4
Content:
you get what you pay for.  the products is slick looking and is a good value.  below are the pro and cons to it.
Pro's: price; easy to use...just plug and transfer files from your computer to the unit. if you know how to use an IPOD then you can figure this one out. 
Con's: 
1/3 of my MP3 files received format error when I try to play them on this unit
DOES NOT PLAY MP4 movies. I will try to convert my MP4 movies to WMA format and see if that will work. 
Good luck in trying to interpret the Chinglish instructions...
this is a followup to my first comment
I wish I could change the ratings to a one star.
After working with this device,I have experienced numerous issues- from not being able to play movies I burned on my pc to playing WMA music files to viewing family pictures that are JPEG format. If you bought one of these sorry devices you too will experience these issues. The latest I have is this message on the screen "Updating MediaLib...". the msg stays on until the battery is drained from the unit. the customer service is great but who has time to keep emailing back and forth trying to get this device to work?  I wish the Category Buyer for Amazon would have done a better job at researching vendors before taking on products like this one. DO NOT BUY!!!!

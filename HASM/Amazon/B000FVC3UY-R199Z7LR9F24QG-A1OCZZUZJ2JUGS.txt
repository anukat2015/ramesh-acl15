Title: Works great 2+ years just need to adjust setting!
Content:
I've owned this space heater for almost 3 years and it works EXCELLENT.
The safety feature shuts off to prevent overheating of the ceramic heater - so depending on the ambient temperature and your setting and desires very hot in short bursts or steady heat in long continual stream - you stimply need to optimize the setting.  It's not that difficult.  Yes it's only manual dial's but I've used this in my 12x14 office for 3 winters and going on the 4th with flawless operation.  For continuous operation simply set on lower of two settings and thermo dial about 1/4" down from max.  If it's drawing in cooler air it will run constantly.
I am completely happy - however it IS fan driven so the fan is noisy.  But it can easily keep a 14x14 room warm and toasty (with the door closed).

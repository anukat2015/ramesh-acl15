Title: How to actually enjoy vacuuming

Miele S4210 Carina Canister Vacuum Cleaner (Melon Yellow)
Finally! A vacuum cleaner that is a joy to use! I love this vacuum. It's compact; very quiet; the attachments are so easy to attach and detach; it has a dial so you can vary how much suction you use, depending on the need. It also has a great little swivel wheel in the front, so the canister follows you easily all around the house. The different attachments all attach on the wand for easy access. Easy foot switch to change between carpet and bare floor. Off/On switch also easily accessible by foot. Excellent design and engineering. Great filtration system. The Miele Carina Canister is many, many steps above any other vacuum I've ever used.

Title: Definitely a complimentary heater, not for those without heating.
Content:
I get headaches from gas-powered wall heaters you usually see in older apartment units. I thought this might be a good deal for my bedroom. While it does the job, my electric bill TRIPLED in a month. This would be better for sparing use at your office or something. Look for a heater that is a little more energy efficient if electricity costs are important to you.

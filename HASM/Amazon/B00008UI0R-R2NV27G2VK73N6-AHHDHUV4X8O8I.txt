Title: Excellent Vacuum! Best Price found on Amazon,com
Content:
I've been using this vacuum since it arrived (BEFORE scheduled date by weeks, literally). I use it several times daily as we have a mini farm and heat with wood. So there is always hay, sand, dirt and wood chips/dust to clean up, oh yeah, and plenty of dog hair & left over dog treats that didn't get ate. This vacuum does it all! I'm thrilled! If it last like my grandmother's Hoover I just retired, I will have more that gotten my money's worth!

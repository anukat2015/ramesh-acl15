Title: Wonderful Machine!
Content:
I have had many coffee makers over the last 35 years and love this one the best of all. I use a tall mug and just remove the grate for a perfect pour....and for a smaller cup put the grate back in...easy compared to cleaning a drippy carafe. Very streamlined and easy to clean.  I have had all the major brand coffee makers and love this one, no one sees what is left in the machine unlike the carafe that sits there out in the open, yet the gage tells you how much java is left.

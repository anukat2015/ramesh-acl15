Title: Not impressed
Content:
We've had this coffee maker for about 6-7 months now. 
1)  Where does all the water go?  
a)  It all steams out the back.  Therefore, you have to put in more water than what you want to end up with in your finished pot.
b)  It leaks out the hole in the back of the coffee maker leaving a constant (but small) puddle of water contstantly on the counter.  The puddle of water is not large enough to drip over the counter edge, but it is irritating.
2)  Why does the coffee taste not only bitter but also with plastic overtones?
a)  Ok, I don't do the vinegar clean every 2 weeks, but I do it at least once a month.  That should be enough for only having 1 pot of coffee a day, right?
b)  The filter basket and lid on the pot are both plastic and I sense that I can taste them in my coffee!  
Good features:
1)  The 5 bell alarm letting you know when the coffee is done.  
2)  I like the looks of the coffee maker.
3)  Not a 3 minute pot of coffee, but brews in a reasonable amount of time.

Title: Waste of Money
Content:
I have a German Shepherd and two toddlers, and they make the typical messes dogs and toddlers make- dog food and cereal crumbs, and hair, hair everywhere. My house is all tile floor and carpet. I might not be so mad at my Bissel if I hadn't paid way more for it than it is listed here for. 
My old vacuum (Eureka) crapped out on me, so after lots of comparing I settled on this Pet Hair Eraser Bissel, and was TOTALLY disappointed. The vacuum didn't create enough suction- straight out of the box- to work the little attachments, and with just one big dog you seriously have to clean out all the filters every 10 minnutes. After a month an a half of this Pain in the A** process, the beater bar does nothing but spit stuff back out, and the hose has hardly any suction. I've taken the POS apart atleast 3 times trying to figure out what the problem is, cleaned all the pieces thuroughly and put it back together, but it hasn't made a difference. So I'm out several hundred dollars and get a headache whenever I look at the thing. Don't waste your money unless you are childless, have all carpet flooring, and no more than one small pet.

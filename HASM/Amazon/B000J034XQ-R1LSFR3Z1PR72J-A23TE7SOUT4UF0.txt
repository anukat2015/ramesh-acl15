Title: Black & Decker Warranty Rigidity
Content:
Based on Consumer Reports recommendations, and the company's description,I ordered the Black & Decker DCM2500 Coffeemaker.  It arrived promptly through Brand Variety, but on first use, I discovered a serious leak in the carafe between the plastic top and the glass.  I contacted Black & Decker about the defective carafe asking that they send me a replacement. They told me that the carafe was not covered by the warranty, but that they would sell me a new carafe. I then contacted Brand Variety who said I could return the coffeemaker for a credit on its cost. They promised to send me a prepaid return label, but their letter did not contain the return label. The policy seems to be spend millions for advertising, but only pennies for customer service.

Title: After a couple weeks, super.
Content:
The MacBook is totally delicious in design, and every aspect of its performance that I have explored is working perfectly. I bought a wireless mouse (from Amazon -- works great) because I found the trackpad to be difficult, but Mac friends tell me that was true for them, too, at the first trials, and then they got used to it. I'll keep using both, to work up my trackpad skills while I'm working quickly with the mouse.

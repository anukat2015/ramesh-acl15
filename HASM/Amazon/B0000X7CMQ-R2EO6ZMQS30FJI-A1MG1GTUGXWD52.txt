Title: Good coffee maker
Content:
A few weeks have gone by since I received the Zoji, and I'm very happy with it.  While I can't tell if it makes 'better' coffee than other brands, it does make good, hot coffee; and the large carafe is a definite plus!  The coffee stays hot for several hours.  I have not had problems with small openings, tight seals, etc, as mentioned in some reviews. It's functional and handsome (as far as appliances go . . .)  A good buy despite the somewhat steep price -

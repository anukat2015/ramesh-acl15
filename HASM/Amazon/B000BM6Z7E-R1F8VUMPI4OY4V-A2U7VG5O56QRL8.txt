Title: Love this machine!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
So glad i bought this mp3 player, it was on sale and i jumped at the price, also the nice metallic color of blue it came in really steered me away from the competition, since I am obsessed with everything being blue, plus I just don't really want to be in the apple cult. :)  
Also, having your own photos on here is more than a novelty, you get to choose both your background image and color theme from anything you can imagine!!!
Very glad to say not only does it look good, but it sounds and works well too! (I purchased some low priced new mini headphones as replacements due to a minor crackling bass sound in the left side, and those darn foam covers kept coming off creative phones)
I have even used this tiny thing to plug into a mixer while dj'ing and actually play in a few clubs already and it even sounds great when hooked into huge sound systems.
I filled up the 8 gigs of space pretty quickly , but it is ok since I constantly keep adding new and removing old trax based on what i am playing currently.
Dance music fans should be happy to discover beatport dot com for  high quality and affordable mp3 downloads, I spent more there the 1st week after getting my Zen than i did on the player itself!
I picked up some protective silicone sleeves in 3 different colors on ebay and now have even more hot looks for my unit, wile keeping it very nicely protected.

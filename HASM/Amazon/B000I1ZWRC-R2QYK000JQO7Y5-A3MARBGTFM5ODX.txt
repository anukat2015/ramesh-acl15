Title: You'll never go back
Content:
Once you go SlR you'll never go back. I got other point and shoot cameras, but never used them after I bought my SLR canon xti. The other day, I ran out of battery and I tried to used a point and shoot to get some picture of some abandoned kitties I found. Then I realized that once you get used to your SLR, you'll find p&s a nuisance. And let's not get into picture quality and pixels.

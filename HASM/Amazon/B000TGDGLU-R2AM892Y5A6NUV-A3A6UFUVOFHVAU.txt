Title: Excellent Heater
Content:
This heater is presently in our lower level family room. It does an exceptional job heating the entire room. I leave it on the lowest setting as it got down in the low 20's (which is unusual for here in Eastern NC)and it kept the room nice and toasty. I was looking for a space heater that would keep the room warm, and after reading the many reviews thought I would take a chance on it and I am not sorry. I highly recommend this heater for people WITHOUT small children as it does get a little too warm on the radiator coils for little hands to touch it.

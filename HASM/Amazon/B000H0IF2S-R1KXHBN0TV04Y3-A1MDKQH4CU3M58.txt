Title: Cute Li'l Thing
Content:
I got this shuffle because my iPod Mini was kind of a pain to lug around at the gym.  I got this and it holds enough songs that I can work out 2-3 times without hearing a song again.  It's awesome because you can clip it darn near anywhere and it holds on tight!  I was worried at first that if I was running that it would fly off, but so far it's really surprised me! I had to get different ear phones because my ears are small and the ear buds won't sit in my ears right but that's only a small inconvenience and is more of a personal issue than a complaint, really.  Great product!

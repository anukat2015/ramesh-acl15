Title: great in my dorm room!
Content:
this is a sweet coffee maker for a dorm room. it is small [this is a plus, as coffe makers arent allowed in my dorm!], and has a cup WITH A LID [great to take to class]. one full cup is ready in 2-3 mins!! it is sort of noisy, thats my only complaint. and the black color makes it harder to clean when dirty. else, is great! imagine all the money saved instead of buying coffee twice a day from starbucks!!

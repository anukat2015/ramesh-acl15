Title: Cheap and effective cold air
Content:
This is a great little machine that even an old lady can operate!  Here in the Southwest corner of the US our temps can reach 110, as they did a week ago.  The little Sunpentown was steadily pumping 67 degree air into our living room.  We use the Sunpentown as a "crutch" to our 4 ton A/C, running them both at the same time.  With the Sunpentown, however, the A/C cycles off and stays off for longer periods of time, saving us lots of dough all the while!  If you live in an area where humidity runs 50% or less, this will be effective in your home.

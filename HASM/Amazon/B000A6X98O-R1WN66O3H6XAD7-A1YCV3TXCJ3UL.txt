Title: Warm and toasty, but occasionally inaccurate
Content:
I bought this heater at Costco for $43 last week. It is quiet, well put together, and really warms the room. My only complaint is that the digital thermostat frequently displays an inaccurate temperature -- like 74 when it's actually 69 degrees. I know because I put a second thermostat next to the unit just to see. While this is annoying (especially when you have to get out of bed into a cold room rather than a nice and warm room), I'm pretty happy overall, and have just learned to set the target temperature higher (like 76 degrees) to compensate.

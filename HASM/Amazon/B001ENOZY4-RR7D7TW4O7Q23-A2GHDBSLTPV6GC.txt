Title: Nikon D90 vs Canon PowerShot G5
Content:
After 6 years with my faithful G5 I decided to buy a new camera. Primary reason was shooting under poor light. First, I wanted to buy Canon G10, but I was disappointed with the quality of 15MP sensor. Then I wanted to buy Canon T1i, but I came out with Nikon D90. There are several reasons for that: reasonable pixel count, very good build quality, very useful and quite good kit lens (18-105), good raw conversion software (Capture NX) and attractive price at a moment.
So, what's the filling when you leave 6 year old compact and start shooting with top quality SLR?
What I like about Nikon D90:
- Good high ISO capability. This is relief: you can peacefully shoot up to ISO 3200, while the G5 was out by the ISO 200. Also, Auto ISO is great in low light.
- Kit lens is great. I really missed wide angle before.
- Metering is very good, especially with flash
- D-Lighting is beautiful feature
- Very responsive and fast camera
- Display is gorgeous
- Lens servo capabilities are excellent
- Viewfinder is very good. I was afraid of that little window since I'm used to look on much larger display, but I have no problem using it (even with glasses).
What I dislike about Nikon D90:
- Autofocus dot in the viewfinder is not easy noticeable and you never really know do you have focus or not unless you turn on that beeping which is loud and irritating. My old G5 can change the volume and sound of autofocus beep, why D90 can't?
- Quite heavy
- Awkward balance when you use a neck strap
- I didn't think that would be the problem, but I miss that manual focus window that shows distance.
- Lens is slow. I know, it's kit lens, it's cheap, but I'm used to G5 F2.0-3.0. High ISO can compensate it, but not entirely.
- Live view is really done badly. But is still very useful feature in some situations.
What I still like about Canon G5:
- Size. The whole camera is as big as the 18-105 lens.
- Autofocus is actually quite fast in good light. (It's the shutter lag that is the problem.)
- Fast lens. That F2.0-3.0 is really great thing. It's disappointing that Canon put slower lens on new G7-G10
- Very little lens distortion.
- When you shoot in jpeg, you can still save the picture in raw while you reviewing it. That's very useful trick that I miss on D90.
What I still dislike about Canon G5:
- Noise. G5 have more noise on ISO 200 than D90 on ISO 3200. ISO 400 on G5 is unusable.
- Red eyes are regular problem.
- Purple fringing is terrible.
- Very slow operation.
- Bad autofocus in low light.
- Lens not wide enough (35-140)

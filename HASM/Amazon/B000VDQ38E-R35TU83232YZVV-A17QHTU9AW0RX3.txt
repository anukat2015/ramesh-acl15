Title: Have Cats?  Buy it!!!!!!!
Content:
To sum it up in one word; awesome!!  
We have two cats that shed like mad and carpeting that is way, way over-due to be replace.  Our old vacuum, a very tired, worn-out Kirby, just wasn't doing the job anymore or worth the money to have it over-hauled.  I've had my eye on this vacuum for quite some time and was sold after I'd read many reviews!  
This instructions were a joke!  All you really need is a long philips and some common sense to put it together.  Very easy, it took all of 10 minutes.  I would, however, recommend reading thru the operation and care at least once and then save it for future reference.
I am amazed at how well it performed on our ancient carpets!  I mean wow!!  We have a small house, around 1100 sq ft, and the canister was filled just after a job on the hallway, living room, and master bedroom!  It serious looks like another reviewer mentioned; the thing vacuumed up a cat-sized amount of fur and a ton of dust in one cleaning!  Simply amazing and yet completely disgusting to think there was that much cat hair the old Kirby couldn't suck up!  I can't wait till my boyfriend comes home this evening to show him the huge wads of fur and dirt.  And to think he thought the Kirby was doing just fine...  
A note of caution though, if you have any throw rugs (or anything else) near where you plan to vacuum, pick them up or they'll get sucked up.  It's that powerful!!!  
Oh yeah!  You need this vacuum!!!!!

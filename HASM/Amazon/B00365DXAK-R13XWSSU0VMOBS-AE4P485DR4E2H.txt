Title: Love this little machine!!!  Only 3 pounds.
Content:
Well I have to say this is one of the most gorgeous machines that I have ever used.  It is so light at only 3 lbs.  It has a fast i5 processor, DVD Rom and a 1GB video card to boot.  It has all the things that I am looking for in such a small package.  It was this or and Apple macbook.  I'm glad I choose this instead.  You can not compare this fast machine with Apple until they incorporate an i5 or i7 in their macbook pros.  
I downgraded the OS from the factory installed WIN 7 to WIN XP for software compatibility issues, but the biggest down size to this is losing 1.5GB of ram.  I can only utilize 2.5GB of ram as appose to the 4GB installed.  Not sure if this will become a problem in the future, but only time will tell.  I am typing on this right now and the keyboard is so comfortable.  I would highly commend it just for the comfort of the keyboard and the nice back lit keyboard.  I am able to see all the keys as they are illuminated.  
Also just one more note, the biggest mistake I made was not to make a backup copy of the WIN 7 CD before I stuck in the Win XP disc.  There is no way to reorder the WIN 7 currently, so I will have to wait Sony or someone who buys the same computer to burn me a copy.  So I highly recommend that you do that first before anything.

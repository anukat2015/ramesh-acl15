Title: Works good.  Sufficient to warm an overhead camper.
Content:
Heater works well. Seems to sufficiently warm an overhead camper. Seems to require a very strong battery.  My husband said the battery we were using was kind of old, so with a newer/stronger battery, it would have probably run longer.

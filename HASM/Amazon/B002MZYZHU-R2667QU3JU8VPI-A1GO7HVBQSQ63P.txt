Title: 5 star until it broke after 1 month
Content:
I really liked the coffee maker. It was very quiet and it made quality cups of coffee. I like coffee strong and I had no issues with the coffee tasting watery. I liked the look of the stainless steel. The Breville is large but it looked very classy in my kitchen. I would of rated it 5 stars but it shut down after a month of use. I was brewing a 10 oz cup of coffee and it put about 2 oz in my cup and locked up. It started to hum and said it was heating. The menu froze also. I called Breville and they walked me through ways to fix it. I guess this is a common problem. The machine would only brew a couple ounces then freeze up again. Breville would of replaced it but I have to say I am dissapointed in the quality of the machine. I returned it to Amazon for a refund. I am very pleased with the Amazon customer service.

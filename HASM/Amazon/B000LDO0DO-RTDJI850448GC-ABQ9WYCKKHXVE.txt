Title: Cheap and badly conceived, poorly built
Content:
Find another machine if you're smart.  This one is not a good deal.  The switches don't work properly, the pretty metal trim popped loose on the second use, cups get hot on the outside and the coffee goes cold quickly.  And, when you open up the top to put water in it, the condensation from the previous uses runs down the back of the machine and puddles on your counter.  It has no automatic shut off, which makes it a potential fire hazard.

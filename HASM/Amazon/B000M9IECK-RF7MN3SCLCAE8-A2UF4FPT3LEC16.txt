Title: Aloha 1500-Watt Column Classic Heater
Content:
This is an excellent heater for a single average sized room.  It uses a fan to spread the heat throughout the room which is supplemented by a oscillating feature.  It is not meant to replace a regular furnace, but, it certainly supplements it very well.  You can run your furnace at a lower temperature and save oil (and we all know how expensive that is).  You can use this heater in the rooms you use the most such as a bedroom and be very comfortable.  It raised the temperature in mine by a good 10 to 15 degrees with the thermostat only on 50%.  It turns itself on and off like a regular furnace does to maintain the temperature.  I am very happy with mine and would highly recommend it.  However, keep in mind it is for an average sized single room.  A single unit will not heat an entire house or larger rooms. You would need an additional unit for each additional room where you need it.

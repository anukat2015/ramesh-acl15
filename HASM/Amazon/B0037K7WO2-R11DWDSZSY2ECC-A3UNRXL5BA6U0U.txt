Title: Best Laptop EVER!
Content:
Ok, I admit to being a techno junkie. I currently own five working laptops, and have bought (God only knows) how many desktops since the very first ones came out.  I own HP, Gateway, Dell, Compaq, and two Acers.  Without a doubt, Acer is on its way to becoming king of the laptop/netbook market!  They produce a remarkable product at an extremely competitive price.  I tested out every laptop at Office Depot, before buying this one for only $499.  What sold me on this model was the incredibly brilliant screen and the amazing audio output with certified Dolby surround sound.  It doesn't sound exactly like a home theater, but it's a vast improvement.  Laptops are notorious for low volume and poor sound quality, so this model blew me away in a side-by-side comparison with other machines.  I absolutely love Windows 7.  The demo on the computer makes it easy to learn the new features, and lots of fun to play with.  This machine is smoking fast, has an attractive design, and a wonderful multigesture touchpad. The ease with which you can enlarge text is a great convenience.  I would have prefered a smaller, lighter model without the numeric keypad, but you can't have it all, so I sacrificed small size for what you get in this machine. (Anyways, I already own the Acer Aspire netbook.) And this screen size and aspect ratio is great for watching movies.   Probably the biggest con with this machine is the somewhat poor battery life, but again, you can't have everything for such a low price, so I just keep it plugged in most of the time.  Overall, it's the most enjoyable laptop I have ever owned.

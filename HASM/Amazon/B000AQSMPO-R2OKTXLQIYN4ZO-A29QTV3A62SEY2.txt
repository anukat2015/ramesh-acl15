Title: Worked great for almost 2 weeks, then died
Content:
Not quite sure what happened here, but I received a coffee maker (a Krupps) for Christmas.  Since we couldn't buy pods anywhere, my girlfriend exchanged it for the Keurig B60 Special Edition; we can get k-cups almost everywhere.
I've made about 20 cups of coffee / hot chocolate since I got it.  This morning, it stopped working.  I have only 1 option for brewing for some reason and that is for the larger cup (the two smaller options won't light up anymore).  If I choose to brew the larger cup, it produces about 1/4 of a cup (actual measuring cup) of coffee.
I called their tech support line and they simply asked me to make sure the ejection nozzle (just the bottom of the dispenser) was clean.  It is quite clean.  They have to now "escalate" this to a higher tech support person.
This is silly.  Its 2 weeks old and I've already got a problem?  Not good.

Follow up:
I called Keurig support and they inquired about my water source.  We live in a rural area and use WELL water (through a whole house water filter) and bottled water (Poland Springs).  I explained those two sources of water and was told that #1, I should NEVER use WELL water with the units and #2, I should NEVER use Spring Water with their units.  They told me that even bottled Spring Water is not acceptable for their units.
After flushing with over 2 gallons of Vinegar at their request, the unit still did not work.  They finally sent me a replacement unit (the B70) which is MUCH quieter and has 4 settings rather than 3.  So, from that perspective it seems nicer.  I've had it now for 2 days (using FILTERED bottled water only as Keurig support requested) and its working so far.

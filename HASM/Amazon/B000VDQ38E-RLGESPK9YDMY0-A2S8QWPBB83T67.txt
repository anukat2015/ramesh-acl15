Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
I live in an old, and I do mean old, farm house with a dog.  Although the house has mostly wood floors, a number of area rugs need to be vacuumed. I was amazed at the amount of pet hair and just plain dirt that the product sucked up. The house actually smelled better, and the rugs (left here by the last owner) looked as if they were shampooed. I emptied the canister 5 times.  It is easy to clean and all the attachments work as expected.  The only issue, and it is a small one, is that the directions could be easier to follow.  However, if you look at the picture of how it looks completely assembled, you should have no problem.

Title: Great heater and even better price!
Content:
I live on top of a mountain in an old home that has very little insulation. Space heaters are a must if you don't want to spend thousands on fuel oil. I bought this heater because of it's high Consumer Reports rating, and for the price, I figured I couldn't go wrong. I was right! Consumer Reports said it was noisey, but in my opinion, only if you are ultra sensative. This is a great buy!

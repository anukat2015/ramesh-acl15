Title: Poorly built
Content:
I bought this after my I got my cats to take care of pet hair, replacing my dad's old vacuum that he gifted to me. I was excited to own my first new vacuum but was disappointed from the start. It was difficult to put together and the plastic piece on the back to hold the hose and extension tools on would not stay in place. It was consistently falling off and in the end I just threw it away and kept my tools in the closet until I needed them. I owned it less than six months before it started losing suction, even though I cleaned it thoroughly after every use (I hated how it was always covered in dust, the excessive cleaning was necessary). The canister and filter were also cumbersome and difficult to remove to empty without getting dust everywhere. I kept it a year because I couldn't afford a new one, but I finally threw it away when I moved and I couldn't be happier!

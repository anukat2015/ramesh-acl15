Title: good for the money

I use Audiograbber with Lame.exe set on '--preset medium' to rip mp3s for this player.  Good happy medium between quality and size.  Then I just drag the entire artist folders onto the Muvo2 from Explorer.  The songs in the folder play in their correct track order (though the MuVo2 can do random, repeat, etc).  
To make playlists I actually use the software that came with player (MediaSource Organizer).  It works well for this purpose.  
I have big hands and long fingers and it took me all of 5 minutes to get used to the buttons.  It's a small pad, but easy to use.
Doesn't have a case and I hear the one sold by Creative is no good..but you should be able to find something else suitable without much hassle.  I am using a case that came from a little generic brand folding knife/carabiner/compass set someone gave me for Christmas.  The MuVo2 fits absolutely perfect (you flip the velcro front up and all but the bottom 1/3rd of the Muvo2 is visible).
Bottom line...if you don't care about being 'hip' and just want a really affordable MP3 player, then this is a good choice.  If you want to be hip and you can justify the cost, or perhaps just really want U2's autographs etched into your mp3 player, then get an iPod.

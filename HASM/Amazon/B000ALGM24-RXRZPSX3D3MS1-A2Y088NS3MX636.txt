Title: Easy install and great performer
Content:
I have been using this product for the last 2 months. I installed it myself and found the instructions straight forward and easy to understand. I modified the default settings which are recommended for the most energy savings and my usage, for the last 2 months compared to the same months last year, has decreased noticeably. The program is also easy to override on the days I am home and want a little more heat.

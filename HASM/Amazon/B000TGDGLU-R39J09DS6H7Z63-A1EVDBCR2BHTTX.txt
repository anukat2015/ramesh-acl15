Title: Great Heater
Content:
Great heater and does the job admirably. Used it for the first time last night, with a low setting of 2, it gradually warmed up the large master bedroom throughout the night, where by the early morning it had to be turned off because it was getting too hot. 
It'd be nice if it had an auto shutoff or a self timer.
Only thing I didn't care for was the faint smell, which is probably due to the oil. The faint smell is present after the unit is heated up. Not sure if the slight smell will still occur after several use of the heater.

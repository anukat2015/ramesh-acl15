Title: Great Coffee
Content:
This is an excellent coffee maker which makes very hot, tasty cup of coffee. The only criticism I have is that it can be a little messy when dispensing the brew as the design is not very user friendly. If I pay attention to what I'm doing, there's not a problem. Unfortunately, I can't convince others who also use this at home to do the same. Oh well....

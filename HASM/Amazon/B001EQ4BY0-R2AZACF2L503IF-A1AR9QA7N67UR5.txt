Title: Disappointed?
Content:
I was excited to get the 50D today, but am disappointed with the "supercharged" Live View feature.  It only works in Creative Zone modes, not basic modes.  
Update: A fellow commenter suggested trying Program Mode (P), as that gives some automatic adjustments, but no auto focus.  Still disappointed.

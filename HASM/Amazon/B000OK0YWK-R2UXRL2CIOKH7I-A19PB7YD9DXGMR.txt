Title: I wanted to like it...and DID!
Content:
What a wonderful product. Software loaded like a charm. I have had absolutely no trouble loading or syncing songs with this software. The screen on the device is, well, gorgeous. Big and beautiful - fabulous colors on all my pics and videos. I paid less than $100 for mine and feel it would have been worth paying even more (glad I didn't, though - who wants to spend extra?) This little gem holds all my music with room to spare. I hooked it up to the Altec Lansing speaker system for Zune and WOW - blows me away. I would highly recommend the Zune to anyone who loves having all their music and pictures at their fingertips. Worth every penny.

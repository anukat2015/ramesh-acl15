Title: Disappointed
Content:
I really want to like this laptop but after nearly 2 months of use this laptop has been a big disappointment. I'm a computer professional and have owned and used many different brands on both a professional and personal level before purchasing this one. 
I use this laptop mainly for emailing and surfing but even simple tasks like that it does poorly, and here's why: 
1. The display on this laptop is very poor - the contrast is off and the viewing angle is narrow. I've tried adjusting the display many times manually and with the wizard but it still looks poor.
2. The track-pad is terrible. It would move my cursor to a different place while I'm typing. 
3. The track-pad also features gestures which don't work too well. It feels like pulling teeth just trying to getting a simple vertical scroll.
4. There's a single button below the track-pad. Because it's a single long button, you need to depress it at the extreme end to left or right click. I've learned to use gesture for left and right-clicking but it's sometimes frustrating because it doesn't always work. And I've tried changing the sensitivity level for the track-pad and button too!
All in all, I would not recommend.

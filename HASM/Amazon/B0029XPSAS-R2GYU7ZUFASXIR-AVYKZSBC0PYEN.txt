Title: NICE & SMALL A/C UNIT THAT REALLY WORKS
Content:
I recently purchased this item when we got hit with a "heat wave".  Homes up here are rarely built w/ air conditioners so there weren't any fans or a/c units to be found in the Pacific Northwest.  I purchased this unit to stay cool for a couple of days and it did the job.  It was pretty much ready to go once I took it out of the box.  I just had to put in the filter (which is plastic so it can be rinsed, dried and reused) and attach the tubing to my window.  Very easy to use.  I like that you can control it with a remote or with the buttons on the front.  I had read that some other units only come with a remote, so if you loose it, you're stuck w/ whatever setting it was last on until you get a replacement remote.  This unit has caster wheels and is easy to push around to where I need it. The noise level was quieter than a box fan.  Overall, I am very pleased with the A/C unit and I think it served it's purpose very well.

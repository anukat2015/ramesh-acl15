Title: BIG Waste of Money
Content:
This is my first review online because I strongly believe this vacuum sucks!  The roller brush always stops spinning because hair gets tangled around it.  This occurs with each use.  The suction/design should be better.  I have to troubleshoot after each use in order to use it again.  So frustrating.

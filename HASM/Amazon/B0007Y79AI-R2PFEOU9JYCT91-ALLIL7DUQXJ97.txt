Title: Gift for my wife
Content:
I have one just like this and I love it so I bought one for my wife and she's gotten a lot of use out of her's as well!! I would certainly spend the extra money and go with the Apple because I have had little problems with their iTunes software. Also, if I were to buy another one, I would probably want a little more memory since I already have my 2 Gig practically full.

Title: This little puppy is strong and heats pretty quickly
Content:
We are very happy with this little puppy. It is small and portable, but very strongly and quickly warms up our living room. It has two settings [900w and 1500w], which is another plus and saves us some money on our energy bill. Will recommend it.

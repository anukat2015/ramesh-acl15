Title: Died after 3 days!!! *UPDATE*
Content:
I owned the 1st generation of Ipod Touch had it for over 2 years and sold it in order to get the 3rd generation. I got it and used it for 3 days. On the 4th day it plain and simply DIED!!!
It didn't power on again, I tried everything to bring the device back to life, but to no avail.
May god bless Amazon for sending me a new device immediately even without sending them the broken one first.
My question to apple: What is going on? 3 days? get your act together asap!.
     *********UPDATED*************
The second Ipodtouch works wonderful!
The first one was probably a lemon, but I couldn't be happier with the current one.

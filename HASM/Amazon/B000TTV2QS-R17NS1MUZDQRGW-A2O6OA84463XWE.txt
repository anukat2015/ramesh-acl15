Content:
This is the best electric heater I ever owned. It has a small footprint. The beeping sound is not loud, as other reviewers have implied. There is no problem with the plug getting hot. If I need a little heat while sitting in front of the computer, I aim the heater towards me from six feet away. Sometimes I let it oscillate left and right, which is a slow movement. I do not use the remote control. My only disappointment is that the pilot light stays lit after I shut it off---suggesting that it is drawing electricity when not in use, the same as a VCR, television set, computer printer, etc.

Title: Miele Sirius
Content:
Since my vacuum died, partly due to multiple not too careful users, I needed a new one. This was strongly recommended by someone who uses several different vacuums and who liked Miele best of all, due to ease of use and longevity. (the deceased lasted maybe 2 yrs) It was located easily and delivered post haste(at the price it  should have come in cloth-of-gold) Stories of reliability,sturdiness, and ease of use together are the prospective trade off for the ridiculous price. On  investigating, I found the entire model range has the same motor, the difference between models being features. Some of these are useful, some only costly-a matter of personal opnion and depth of pocket. That said, I thought it was particularly cheesy, this being a mid range model, that a power head is not included and must be purchased as an extra. I would feel it was cheesy even with the base model. Very bad move in my opinion.

Title: Hot water in a flash
Content:
I have used a Hot Shot for many years and wouldn't be without one.  Now, I give them to other people for gifts and I get nice remarks about them.  Much quicker and safer than using the microwave to make a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.  Also useful for making instant oatmeal or instant grits.

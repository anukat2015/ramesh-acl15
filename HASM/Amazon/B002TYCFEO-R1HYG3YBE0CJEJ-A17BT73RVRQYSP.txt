Title: The best bottom of the line machine i've every bought
Content:
One lesson that my father drilled into me is that you get what you pay for.  If you buy bottom of the line you will get a bottom of the line item.  The Acer 5532 does its best to prove my father wrong.
The ram at 3 gigs is less than almost any new machine, it has only 2 usb ports, the memory card reader is a simple push in, the hard drive of 160 gig is smaller than almost any new machine you will buy, there is no web cam and the AMD Athlon TF-20 1.60 gh processor is not a racehorse in any sense of the word.
But this machine cost me only $350 (including tax) new!  I've given it a heavy workload in blogging and writing and it has done the job.  The screen is crisp and clear, everything functions fine, the battery life is only 2 1/2 hours but that is adequate for my needs and the Windows 7 OS has proven itself to be all that Microsoft claimed it is.
My only complaint has been the right arrow key which has proven itself kind of weak, and the size of the touchpad area tends to make it easy for my hand to accidentally brush it when typing.
This machine does everything I want in a laptop for a price that is affordable in very tough times for me.  Maybe when I'm doing better I might consider a system with a bit more OOMPH but if you need a new system and want to do so on a shoestring this does the job, I mean cripes for the price of my son's Apple we could have bought one of these for each member of the family and still had $200 left over.
The specs certainly make this bottom of the line but not bottom of the barrel.  It is a good starting laptop for a youth or an elder just beginning their computer use.  
I'd buy it again.

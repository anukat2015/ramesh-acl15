Title: nice camera during the day...
Content:
Having bought my camera through the superior service of Amazon.com and having a 28-300mm lens and 580ex flash the only real problem I am having is shooting at night. Not that the camera doesn't work but it is hard to see the buttons on the camera. I mean pushing the button too take a picture is easy, no doubt but as an example i was trying to take pictures on the 4th. of July at night of fire works at the Columbus, Indiana campus of Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana and I couldn't see the buttons on my camera to change my manual settings. The screen on the back of the camera was well illuminated but the support buttons were not visible at all. While fireworks were blazing i was trying "fumbling" to changer my shutter speed and ISO. What canon needs to do to improve this is illuminate all of the buttons on the rebel xt and all of it's cameras so all of the buttons can be seen at night. It would also be handy to have a on/off switch for these lights for battery conservation when they are not needed. but make the conservation of light button big and easy to use. aside from the night lighting it is an excellent camera and i would highly recommend it.

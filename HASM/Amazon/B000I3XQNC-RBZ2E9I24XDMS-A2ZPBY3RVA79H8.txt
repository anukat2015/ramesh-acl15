Title: Nice body - shame about the lens
Content:
The body is capable of producing great quality, razor sharp images. Sadly the same quality does not extend to the standard 18-55 kit lens, either mechanically or optically. For example...
- The inner lens tube wobbles all over the place, which makes you wonder what is actually holding it in position.
- Accurate manual focusing is impossible due to the amazingly poor design and build.
- The lens mount is plastic.
- The optics are shockingly poor. Don't expect sharp images, esp at the tele end. If you compare the optical performance of this lens to the Nikon std 18-55 kit lens, you could be forgiven for thinking that Canon are having a bit of a laugh. You can make up your own mind if you check out the "Reviews" section of the Photozone site (comes up via any of the search engines). Try opening two web browser sessions and size them down width ways so you can compare the two lenses side by side. I think you'll be shocked at what you see.
So why does Canon ship such a poor lens as standard with this body? Beats me - its reputation is widely reported in mags and online. The sooner Canon discontinue the std 18-55 lens the better - it's absolute pap and has no place on a current day DSLR.
My recommendation to anyone thinking of buying this camera is to buy the body and choose the lens separately. If you must have a Canon lens then the IS version of the 18-55 is infinitely better than the std (non-IS) 18-55 kit lens (in terms of the image quality it delivers anyway - mechanically it's not much better). Or, if you don't mind going down the third party lens route, you could opt for the Tamron 17-50 F2.8 - a cracking lens that really does justice to the superb quality and design of the body. Which to choose? The Canon IS 18-55 is cheaper, while the Tamron 17-50 is faster and significantly better in terms of image quality (sharper into the image corners and sharper at the tele end too).
Happy hunting. :-)

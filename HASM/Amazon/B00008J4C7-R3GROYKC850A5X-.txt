Title: Don't buy this one!
Content:
While the Shark Roadster has adequate suction and is light to carry around, it is impossible to replace the HEPA filter in the machine.  Replacement parts are simply unavailable.  (Target sends you to the company website; the company website tells you to call the 800 number, and the 800 number is always--and I mean always--busy.)  In other words, after six months, all you can do with the machine is throw it out and buy something else.

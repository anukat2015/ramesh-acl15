Title: Not worth the hassle
Content:
I bought 2 of these players as gifts. At the same time I also bought 2 Creative Zen Stones as gifts (for our extended families overseas). 
I loaded both a Sansa and a Zen in the last few days with MP3 files using Windows Media Player.
It took less than 5 minutes (not including the transfer time) to do it on the Zen (which worked right out of the box). 
The Sansa took 3-4 hours last night. It started well as the player recognized it and started a playlist sync. Stopped after first file. From then on it became a challenge. I tried drop and drag (did not work). Finally downloaded the firmware update from Sandisk (this was also not easy and had to do it several times). Then it synced.
Why did I buy this? Low price and FM capability. I WISH I HAD PAID $9 MORE TO GET TWICE THE STORAGE AND NO HASSLES WITH THE CREATIVE ZEN STONE (MUCH SMALLER AND RECHARGEABLE). Well hindsight is 2020 but I hope this review helps you in making a right choice.
Sandisk you are no Apple (I also own a new shuffle) and unfortunately not even a Creative.
UPDATE: Since the review I also loaded the other Sansa and Zen. I lucked out with the Sansa this time because the update software made me chenge the USB setting to MSC mode (in the settings menu). With the Sansa sync-ed to Windows Media Player without any trouble.
I would add 2 more stars to the rating based on this update. My view still remains that unless you are looking for FM go for the Zen Stone (for $9 you get 512MB more; it is SMALL (slightly bigger than iPOD shuffle) and rechargeable (save on some batteries and associated costs).

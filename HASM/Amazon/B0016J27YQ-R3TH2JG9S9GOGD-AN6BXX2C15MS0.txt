Title: Not exactly what you expect
Content:
When you get an air conditioner you expect something that works the same like your old electricity wasting product, but without the electricity bills piling up. If you are expecting this to replace it, you are in for a rude awakening. This is not what you expect whatsoever. It works like it says: cool, but is it really as cool as you think? On a scale from 1, being a regular fan, and 10, taking a cold shower, I would most likely give it a 3'ish. I'm not trying to insult the product at all; I am trying to give the best review that I can so that no one falls into the same fate as I have.

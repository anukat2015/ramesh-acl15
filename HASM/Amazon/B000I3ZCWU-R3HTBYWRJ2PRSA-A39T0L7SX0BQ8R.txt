Title: Excellent camera for me
Content:
I am very pleased with this purchase. Canon has a way of making advanced photography techniques easy for me to use. I upgraded from my Canon S1IS to the Rebel and I am very pleased with everything the Rebel can do and how simple it is for me to grasp the features and use them. The quality of my amateur photography has leaped into realms I never dreamed of. I could get technical and reel off numbers, stats and stuff but this purchase was not like that for me. I just read a lot of reviews and rolled the dice. Glad I did. No regrets.

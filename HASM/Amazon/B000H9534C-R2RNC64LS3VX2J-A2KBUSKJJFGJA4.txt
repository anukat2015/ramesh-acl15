Title: Using heater for live-aboard boat
Content:
This heater warms my boat up very quickly.  It feels safe, because the slightest tip over turns it off.  Early mornings, I can use the remote to start it up before I get up.  I wish we could turn the beeps off as an option.  They are useful at times to know the heater is set, but if one of us is sleeping, it is annoying.  The instructions seemed a little complicated and it took a while to figure them out.  We had the same model heater previously, but the fan stopped working and we were afraid to use it lest it become too hot.  I have had 6 or 7 electric heaters since I moved on the boat and this is the best.

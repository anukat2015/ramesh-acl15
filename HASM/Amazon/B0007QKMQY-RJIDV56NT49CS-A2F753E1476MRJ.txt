Title: Rebel XT
Content:
Well built, excellent lens. very wide choice of options from simple point and shoot to very sophisticated settings.  Light and sturdy so it travels well.  An excellent camera, but that's nothing unusual for Canon.  Perhaps the non pro will find the learning path to all the features daunting, but Canon offers several ways to learn, too.

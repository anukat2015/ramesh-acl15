Title: Great camera -- packed with features!
Content:
I bought this camera after many months of saving up and researching digital SLRs... and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase!  I'm a professional by no means, but I really love how much functionality is packed into this little guy.  The giant LCD display on the back is just awesome--combine that with the 10 MP and it makes this camera a much better purchase than one of the larger, more expensive Canon DSLRs. 
Also, I was a little nervous before I bought the camera because I read a lot of reviews that talked about the size of the camera being hard to handle.  Well, my hands are HUGE (I can palm a basketball) and I have had no problems at all, and I love the fact that it is relatively smaller and easier to carry around than the larger counterparts.
Finally, if you are just starting out, then you will be plenty satisfied with the kit lens, which provides some decent range and a nice wide-angle end.  If you are waiting to buy the camera because you are trying to save up for the perfect lens, don't!  Buy the kit today and then save up and add to your lens collection down the road--you won't be disappointed!

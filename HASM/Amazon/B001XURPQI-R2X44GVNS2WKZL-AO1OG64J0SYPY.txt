Title: Great entry level DSLR
Content:
For an entry level dSLR I have no complaints. Sure it isn't the 5d mk II but let's be real here. Whether you are just getting into photography or need a solid back up then this is a great camera for you! I like how light weight it is (or some may read cheap and plastic), the large screen, and the video OPTION! If you are going to be shooting a ton of video then get a video camera! All in all I think this is a great camera body.

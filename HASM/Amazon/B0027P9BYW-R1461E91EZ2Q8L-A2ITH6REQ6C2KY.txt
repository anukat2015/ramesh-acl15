Title: Fully Loaded Laptop
Content:
I bought this laptop to replace a 3 year-old Toshiba Satellite U-205.  I did a lot of product research before settling on this one, and I must note that I strongly considered buying an apple but found its features lacking.  
Great Features Include:
Very good processor(not the fastest for laptops, but not far off)
Excellent graphics card(doesn't get much better in a laptop)
Blu-Ray Player!(full hd movies wherever you want to watch them without taking up massive amounts of hard drive space)
16.4 inch screen and some nice built in speakers do Blu-Ray movies justice.
HDMI out!(it could not be any easier to hook up to your HDTV, dual monitor support makes computing much more fun)
Great battery life(you can actually use it for a few hours before you need to plug-in, seriously.)
Stylish design.(Mat-black top with shiny VAIO symbol, beautiful screen, keyboard, even the power button looks nice)
Good build quality.(might not be an aluminum uni-body, but it's no piece of junk, very sturdy)
The price is right.
Downside:
HDMI out and a Blu-ray drive do not necessarily mean that you'll be able to use it as a blu-ray player for your big screen.  Although the HDMI out enables very convenient use of your HDTV as a primary or second monitor, I've experienced issues trying to play blu-ray on the big screen.  I'm not sure if it's because of Windows, WinDVD software, or simply the hardware not being powerful enough.  This is the one and only let-down I've experienced with an otherwise great computer.

Title: Good for a few years
Content:
Reviews always seem to come from people who recently bought the product. I bought this a few years ago after my husband picked an awful Dirt Devil upright that fell over every time I used the wand and was impossible on stairs. I was so happy to get back to a canister. This is light and mobile and very easy to empty. The cord is really long and you can vacuum everywhere hardly replugging. We loved it. It can't be more than 3 years old and the buttons on the handle work sporadically and it often won't shut off without being unplugged. The cleaning head attachment won't come off any more, so I can't switch to any of the attachments. And, mostly, it just doesn't seem to pick up well any more. It was a good price and has great features, but I had really hoped it would last longer.

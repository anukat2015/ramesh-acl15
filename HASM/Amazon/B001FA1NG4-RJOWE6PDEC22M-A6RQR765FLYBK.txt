Title: Apple is big brother
Content:
After spending an extra 130.00 dollars and 9 hours of support that spanned three companies; my software company Microsoft and Apple and finally Dell. I discovered it was Apples deal that unless the device is in DISK MODE which is rather complicated to do...please see instructions online otherwise it doesn't work, meaning it wil say "Itunes has shut down" and that will be that. Well in disk mode when one first attaches the device it will ask for a credit card as you register the Nano.  Which is sinister and I think unforgivable.  I use  the device and I kind of think it was worth the headache still it annoys me how complicated the initial setup was. I think it is shame on Apple for needing my credit card to allow me to play. Bothers me...a lot! It works although I think that the instructions are lousy and made to look simpler (setup) than it is.  Good luck!

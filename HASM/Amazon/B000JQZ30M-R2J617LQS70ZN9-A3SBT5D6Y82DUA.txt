Title: Great little heater
Content:
This Lasko product is really neat.  My wife hadn't seen a picture of it.  When it arrived, she really liked its looks.  We got it the beginning of April, so we haven't had to use it very much.  However, we've had one or two cold nights.  When I turned it on to heat up the immediate area in our large living room so that we could watch TV in comfort, it worked great!  I had to turn it off after just a few minutes, because it warmed up the air so quickly.  Even though it is a fan unit, it's really quiet.  We plan to use it in a basement bedroom next winter.  I have no doubt that it will work wonders.

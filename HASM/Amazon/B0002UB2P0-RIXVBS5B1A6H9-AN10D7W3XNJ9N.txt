Title: Nothing but good experience with the Carbon
Content:
I've had the Carbon for almost a year and I don't have any complaints.  The battery life is fantastic and I think the form factor is great.  Small enough for your pocket but still very easy to use with one hand.  I also run/excercise with this unit often and it has never skipped on me.  I would probably rate this 4 1/2 if that was an option because I wish the original case it came with was better (no belt clip or ability to view the screen while in the case) and I wish it had an FM tuner.  Other than that, I think it is a great player at a great price.

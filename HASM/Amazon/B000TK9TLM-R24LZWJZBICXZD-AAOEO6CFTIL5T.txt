Title: Some good, some bad.
Content:
I've used this heater regularly for about 2 weeks now. 
It heats a 20x12 basement room in about 15-20 minutes. 
Like another reviewer said, it has developed a slight rattle, but for me only when it oscillates. Even then, it's slight.
I have not looked to see the difference in the electric bill.
It did smell a little the first 2 times I used it, but that went away. Cord gets a little warm, but not really.
Not a bad heater at $32 shipped.

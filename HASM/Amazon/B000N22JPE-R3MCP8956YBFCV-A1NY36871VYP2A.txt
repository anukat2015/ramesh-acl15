Title: love this coffemaker!
Content:
This coffeemaker is the best one that I have bought in years (and I've had to buy one almost every year for some reason or another). Finally, a pot that doesn't drip, a setting for 1-4 cups so that the water goes through slower to maintain coffee strength and I LOVE the red color - very cheerful looking on the counter.  The only complaint I have is that the water reservoir has a small opening so when pouring water into it you have to be careful or you'll pour water on the counter. I had a Cuisinart before that had the coffee grinder for beans but did not like the mess it made (cleanup was awful).  This coffeemaker does not have the grinder so it's easy to maintain and I just use a separate grinder if I want to use whole beans.

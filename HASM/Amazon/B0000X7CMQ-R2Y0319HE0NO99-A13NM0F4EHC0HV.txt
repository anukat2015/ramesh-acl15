Title: Finishing touches for a great coffee maker
Content:
This is a great value in a drip coffee maker.  I have owned mine for several years and have no complaints about it whatsoever.  I have found two things that complete this.  One I discovered in another review of this product, and that is to heat the carafe with hot water prior to making the coffee and further to use hot water (out of the faucet) to make the coffee.  This makes for hot coffee that retains its heat long enough to enjoy the coffee.  The second finishing touch is to use a permanent mesh coffee filter rather than a paper filter.  The one that fits this coffee maker is the Medelco #4 Cone Permanent Coffee Filter .  True, you get a few particles in the coffee, but one has to look hard to notice.  The plus side of this is that the coffee retains the oils in the ground beans rather than their being absorbed by a paper filter, and this begins to approximate coffee made in the french press coffee maker.  With those two finishing touches, I drink excellent coffee that is adequately hot for over two hours every morning (and sometimes at night).

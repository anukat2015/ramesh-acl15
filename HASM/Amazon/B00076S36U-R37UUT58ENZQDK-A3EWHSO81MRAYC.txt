Title: a bit smelly
Content:
A bit smelly but I am picky; I couldn't notice it unless I'd been outside and came back in. 6 tankfulls and 2 double dryburns gradually reduced the odor. I put my aspen thermoelectric fan on top to blow the heat around (I never attached the top guard) and I finally have my ideal kerosene heater. If you leave off the guard you have to rebend the handle so it's tight against the top pan, I very nearly had mine tumble down the stairs when one end came out before I did this. The top gets to about 275*F so you can cook on it if you're careful. The old short wick problem was apparently fixed and I get about 12 hours from a tankfull. I searched the web and this is the only kerosene heater of its type available in the U.S. right now so I had to have it, and now I do.

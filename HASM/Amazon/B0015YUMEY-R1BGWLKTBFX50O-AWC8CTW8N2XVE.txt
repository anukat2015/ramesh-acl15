Title: Super Impressed with Macbook PRO
Content:
Coming from many PCs in my life, I have to say I couldn't be more pleased with the Macbook PRO. The LCD is sparkling clear, the keyboard is strong and quiet, the speakers are decent, clear (but a bit underpowered) and the software is great. Go check out Apples website before buying and look at the included "iLife" products. It is truly amazing that this software is INCLUDED with mac! Also check into student/education or other discount programs to see if you qualify. I would advise a 3 year warranty to be safe, laptops have issues more often than desktops according to most! Also, grab a bluetooth mouse, and a cover/case on the way out and youll be all set!
Enjoy the quality!

Title: Long-term user of Java Perk
Content:
I have owned the JavaPerk for about 8-9 years. After about 5 I had to replace the cord, contacted Salton and received  replacement quite quickly. Have also replaced at least 2 of the plastic knobs. Cheap to replace but shipping is high. Now it is on its last legs... I plug it in , it runs but does not get hot enough so I need to wait approx 30 minutes and plug it in again. Same complaints about the very tight-fitting top & plastic knob. Why or why can't they make it of glass? I'd happily pay extra.
However ...I really like the taste of the coffee, its size & style. It is hard to find a medium size electric percolator. I'm about ready to take a chance and buy a new one, keep old one for spare parts.

Content:
Month back, I have start using this laptop and experience that Laptop has less noise and pretty quick. Window 7 is good as compare to Vista, which I have in my other laptop. I have not installed heavy weight software till time so I can't say any thing about performance. Till time it's working fine. Keyboard is of different kind for us because we use HP laptop.

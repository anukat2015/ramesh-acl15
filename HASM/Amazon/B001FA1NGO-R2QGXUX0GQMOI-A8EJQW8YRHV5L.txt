Title: Freezes more than MR Frostie!
Content:
I bought this for my son from Target two weeks ago for a birthday present.  Its been freezing up right out of the box.  If I try to plug it into any aftermarket IPOD docking station (ie ILive or Bose) it reads that it isnt charging compatible and it freezes again.  Techsupport instructs me to toggle the Hold switch or to reset it holding the Menu and Center button but the clickwheel still wont unfreeze.  The support is lousy and everywhere I try to find any answers it seems that the "company" has sent its minions to delete the postings.  If it wasnt for my son loving the thing I would just return it and buy him a more user friendly MP3 player.

Title: Canon 40D
Content:
This camera replaced my old 20D and is an improvement particularly in the menu display.  Although it also has a 3 inches LCD monitor, the images when displayed and not clear enough to determine sharpness and when one zooms in to increase detail, still is not possible to determine sharpness.  The Nikon D200 and the Sony A700 have quite superior LCD monitors, particularly the later. 
The autofocus although claimed improved by the manufacturer, is not better than the one in the 20D.

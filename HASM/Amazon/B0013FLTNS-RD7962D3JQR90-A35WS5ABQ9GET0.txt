Title: Excellent Apple Product
Content:
Having used both Mac and Windows products in the past, I decided to transition my home and business back to Mac after experimenting with Windows VISTA for a couple of weeks.  The Macbook works well as expected, but I was happily surprised by the level of integration of audio/visual.  A very nice design with no problems with either software or hardware after 2 months of use.

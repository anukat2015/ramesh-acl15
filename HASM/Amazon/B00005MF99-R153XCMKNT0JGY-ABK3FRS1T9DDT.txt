Title: Deserves O stars. Worst coffemaker sold today
Content:
I bought this because it says no drip. I never knew what drips were, before this coffeemaker. The plastic rim around the top of the glass carafe fills with coffee and pours out on the counter as you pour into your cup. You cannot get inside the rim to clean it, so it looks dingy. I wrote to Black and Decker about it and they say they don't actually make it at all. They farm it out. So when I wrote the appropriate company, I had a response: Tough going, we have our money-don't like it, too bad. As a result-I will not buy anything with the cover name Black and Decker again. On a more positive note: You can spill coffee faster with this pot-it makes it amazingly fast.

Title: worst computer I've ever bought
Content:
Bought one of these for $2000 with the best memory and options.
8 months down the road- the CD/DVD/ LightScribe drive no longer works, 1/3 of the USB drives no longer works. The tracking pad makes my fingers raw, and when I plug in the mouse, its erratic as well. If you are at a desk, plan on using the unreliable wireless anyway, because the port for a wired cord is in the right front, which means if you are using a mouse you knock the internet cord out all the time. I got the best memory available for this computer and it still runs Vista at a glacial pace. The touchscreen is cool, except no matter how many times you calibrate it, your writing appears 1/2"-1" away from where you intended it.
My 4-year old Mac runs better. Look at different computers, this one isn't worth the money.

Title: Only an OK coffee maker
Content:
Although I have had it about a year I was sorry I bought it from day one. The lid is a pain to get off, literally. You can screw it on ever so slightly but after the coffee is brewed, and a bit of heat and pressure build up or something and it gets to be where you can hardly unscrew the thing and the edges are somewhat sharp. The coffee has always tasted bland and really not quite hot enough for me. I have to nuke my cup just to get it at the right temperature. I am ready to buy a new coffee maker and it will not be one of these. I don't know where all these glowing reviews came from but they must be stockholders or something.

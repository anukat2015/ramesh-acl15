Title: I LOVE My iPod!
Content:
I am a huge music fan and I now don't know what I would do without my iPod.  I purchased this one to replace my old 20 GB because it soon became too small to hold all of my music.  I was disappointed at first with the lack of "cool" accessories that were available for the Classic, that has since improved.  With this iPod I am able to add videos and pictures too.  I currently have over 6,000 songs, 4 movies and 200 pictures on my iPod and it's not close to being half full!  I have noticed that with adding the album pictures, it seems a little sluggish on the display for a few seconds (doesn't affect the music playing).  Overall, I LOVE my iPod and now I do have a FM Transmitter XtremeMac IPV-APV-00 AirPlay Boost FM Transmitter for iPod Video (White) to use with it but I wish there was a better option for a transmitter.

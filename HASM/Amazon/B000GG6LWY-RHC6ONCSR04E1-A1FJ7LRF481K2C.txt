Title: Great heater that won't blow circuits
Content:
I bought this space heater because I have a small office in an older poorly heated building.  The space heaters out that are easily available at the discount stores used too much electricity and we were constantly blowing circuits at work.  This heater keeps me warm and uses much less electricity.  So I can be toasty without blowing circuits.  This heater would probably not work well for a large space though or a cubicle style office that didn't have a door to keep the heat in.

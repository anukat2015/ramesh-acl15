Content:
way better bang for the buck than costco's floor parabolic dish heater.  it heats up faster.  it does not make clicking noises to regulate heat - it only has a high (800W) and low (400W) setting.  it is only ~ 3-4ft high.  but it can be tilted up or down.  it throws out light equivalent to a 60wat t bulb w/a orange tint.  but it doesn't bother me - kinda like a fireplace :)  the timer feature is nice ( so you can fall asleep w/o worrying about turning off the heater.  remote is real sensitive - just stick your hand out the cover to use.

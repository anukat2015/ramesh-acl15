Title: Audio Study Made Easy
Content:
I really don't know how I lived without it before.  For years, the software for iTunes constantly froze and frustrated me.  So, I bought several other MP3 players, but none of them were particularly satisfactory. 
Finally, the iPod software is working well on my computer, but more importantly, a range of materials are now available for my iPod.  I have downloaded free of charge the audio Bible and other religious texts from the website of my church -- which now has audio scriptures available in Portuguese and Spanish in addition to English!
I discovered Faith Through Hearing and was able to download Bibles in Japanese and Korean.
Then I discovered the membership on audible which includes a free daily audible download of Wall Street Journal.   
My iPod will now plug into the new cars that are being produced and I have the mini speakers and bring it with me whenever I travel so I have a full collection of scriptures, audio books, music.  This magic little device allows me to easily and comfortably wait for a doctor's appointment or a plane flight.  The battery is so long, it can keep me entertained on transoceanic flights.  
It's the greatest little gift to myself.

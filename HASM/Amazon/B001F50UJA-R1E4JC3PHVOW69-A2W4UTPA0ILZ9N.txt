Title: Great sound, easy to use reliable
Content:
My wife has an iPod nano, and while the sound is good, the iPod has had a reputation for breaking and I found the iTunes store a nightmare to navigate.
For me, it came down to the Sony or the SanDisk.  While the SanDisk is less expensive and has the microSD slot, it is almost as fragile as glass.  When I looked at them at the local BestBuy, the SanDisk on display was broken after 2 DAYS on display.
The Sony has been reliable (so far), the sound rivals anything that I've owned and it was easy to use and to download onto.  I have been using My Computer to copy over files, but it comes with software that makes it a matter of drag and drop to download.  And in my opinion, it's a better deal than the iPod, especially with 99-cent downloads from Amazon, compared to $1.29 for new tunes from the iTunes stores.

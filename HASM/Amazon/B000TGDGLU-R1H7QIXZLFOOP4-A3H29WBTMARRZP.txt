Title: Best purchase ever!
Content:
I have tried to talk my husband into purchasing a space heater for quite a while now, especially for the master bedroom so that we don't have to heat the whole house just for a quick shower. So I went on line to check on some reviews regarding space heaters. Well, this DeLonghi oil-filled heater seemed to have all the raves! The recommendations that readers/buyers have made were right on. No NOISE from a fan! Even heat, easy to roll on the wheels. Actually, no negatives. We ended up buying two and talked our two friends and one neighbor and father into buying one also. They are all pleased. Best purchase we have made in a long time to be this satisfied.

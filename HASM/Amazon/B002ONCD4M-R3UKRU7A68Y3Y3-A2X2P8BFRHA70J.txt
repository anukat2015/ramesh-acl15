Title: Great features and performance for the price
Content:
I needed a laptop replacement computer quickly and saw this at a great price.  Fast processor and large highspeed hard drive--wireless N and Bluetooth.  The 12 cell battery is large and heavy but it is great having the extra charge time.  My first HP (I have always been a Dell guy) but I could not wait for the build time--especially having to deal with their now poor service.  So far--a great value and I would recommend this DV6-1350US Notebook.

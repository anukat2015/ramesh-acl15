Title: Sweet!
Content:
I was looking for a travel computer to fit into a backpack for airplane carry-on. I never felt comfortable taking the 15" laptop. This fits the bill perfectly. This unit is nice! High def screen is impressive. Typing is relatively easy on smaller keyboard. The trackboard actually has some nice features that make a travel mouse unnecessary for the short term. The black glossy cover does make it seem as if you just got home from your job at the vaseline factory but I get the same sensation when I look at the ear end of my cell phone. Where did that come from? There are other reviews here that eloquently describe the technical features that elevate this computer above most netbooks. Read now and believe now. This is a gem. Good things do come in small packages! Kudos to Amazon, this cost much less than on the Dell site.

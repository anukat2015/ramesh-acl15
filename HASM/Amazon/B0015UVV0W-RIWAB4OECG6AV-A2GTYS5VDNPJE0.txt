Title: Warms room better than any, but breaks quickly
Content:
We love these heaters and have 3 of them - warms better than any other space heater we have found (and we have tried quite a few).  The problem is they work for about a year and then all of them seem to die....seems to be thermostat that goes bad.  The good news is that Vornado customer service is excellent about letting you return them and sending you a new one (has 5 year warranty).  The negative (other than all of ours have had to be replaced) is that even though Vornado will replace them, it takes about 15-20 days to get it back.   Well, in all honesty 15-20 days is a good portion of a cold cold month....and of course, it is cold or we wouldn't be using it to begin with.
I am torn about recommending them because they warm so well, but clearly there are design issues if all of ours have had to be replaced (one of them we just sent back a 2nd time in less than a year).   The price is double most others - For $150, I can just turn up our real home heat....

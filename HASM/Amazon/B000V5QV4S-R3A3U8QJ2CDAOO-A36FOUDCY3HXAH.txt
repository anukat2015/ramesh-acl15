Title: Best Price on Canon SLR with Warranty
Content:
I was a bit worried about buying an expensive electronic item on-line, but I had done my research and I knew I wanted THIS camera.  I received it promptly.  The local camera store had tried to scare me saying that cameras bought on-line had no warranty or if they did, it would be an overseas warranty.  Well, mine came with a warranty from the US of A!   I was using this camera within hours of receiving it after charging the battery.  It takes beautiful photos and it is easy to learn.  Be sure to buy a memory card.  I hadn't realized it didn't come with one.  I saved money buying this camera at Amazon and it is a great SLR for an amateur with aspirations of becoming a professional.

Title: Wonderful heater
Content:
We bought one 1500 Comfort Zone heater last year and it heats our whole upstairs, about 1400 sq. feet. It heats all areas except for having to turn on the heater in our bathroom when showering. We have it set about 72 degrees and live in Northern New York where the temps get quite cold.
We do have a fireplace with heat blowers that we use also.
Looks like we saved about $180 last heating season, certainly not a 50% saving but still good.
Am trying to decide if I want to invest in one for our finished basement that we keep heated all winter also.

Title: Works great, budget in an extra 100$ for plugins and accessories
Content:
I've had the 160GB 605 for two weeks now and I'm quite satisfied with it. The first one I received had a defective hard disk and had to be exchanged for a replacement from Amazon (which is a quick and painless process by itself), and the replacement has been going great guns so far.
Things I like:
- You can navigate without using the touchscreen - the side buttons give you access to everything you might want to do, except perhaps browsing on the internet
- If you buy the web browser plugin (Opera, $20), you can browse the web and watch videos on youtube. I was also able to stream music/radio which is a really welcome feature.
- Flick through photos on the screen like the iphone - fun!
- Oodles of space and a large screen. My music collection isn't so large, but it's good to know that I have the extra space
- You can check and download updates directly on the device when you're connected to the internet, so no more fiddling with the PC or Mac
- Works great with my macbook pro, showing up as an external disk
- Personalization! Some color support, but you can choose any picture or any frame of a video to set as the background for the home screen.
Things I'm not too hot about:
- The 20$ for the browser, 20$ to play raw DVD files (in the vob format)
- USB charging is pretty slow, and it's 30$ for a mini dock or 50$ for a dock with an additional battery.
- Though you can play raw dvds with the 20$ plugin and choose the soundtrack, you can't use subtitles, which I'm hoping comes in a future update.
- Recording is only available if you spring for the 100$ dvr base, playback on the tv only available if you choose the dock or the base (50 - 100$)
Overall, it's a great device, and well worth the $480 (device and accessories/plugins) I've paid for it so far. Battery life and general build quality remains to be seen :)

Title: Great vacuum for hardwood floors
Content:
After a year of using a Swiffer to clean my hardwood floors, I wanted to get something that would speed up the process of cleaning my 1300 sq ft apartment.  I saw the great reviews on this Miele model so I ordered this from Amazon.  
I already had a Miele Washer/Dryer set that I was very satisfied with and this vacuum cleaner lives up to the same standards.  The canister rolls easily on my hardwood floors without scratching it.  While I wouldn't say it's as silent as some reviewers make it out to be, it's certainly much quieter than my old traditional upright vacuum.  
The main hose is long and reaches a long ways underneath sofas and beds.  It was fairly effective at removing dog hair from my sofa.  I found it convenient that I could turn off the vacuum with my foot because it has a big button for it on top side of the canister.  The retractable cord slides easily back in at the touch of a button.
Overall, I think this is a great product.  Only reason I give it 4 stars is due to the hefty price.

Title: Works as advertised
Content:
I've read many reviews of this product before and now after over 2 months of use.  Basically works as advertised.  Do not expect it to heat any room instantly, i.e. it's a radiator!  Do not expect it to be OK to touch, i.e. it's a heater!  Do not expect it to not smell upon first use, i.e. it's oil-filled!  But if you want a safe, fairly easy to move around from room to room, economical (compared to box space heaters), quiet heater for a 12 x 15 room that maintains a steady temperature, it works great!

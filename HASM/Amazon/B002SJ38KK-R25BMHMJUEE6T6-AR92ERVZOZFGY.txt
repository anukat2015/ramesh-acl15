Title: Perfection.
Content:
This little netbook is a rockstar. The full-size keyboard allows fast typing (no oddly-placed shift keys or reversal of the delete and backspace), the multi-touch control is intuitive (especially for iPod touch/iPad users), and the screen is beautiful. Plenty of hard-drive space, runs like a racehorse, weighs nearly nothing, more than sufficient battery life, and Windows 7 64-bit is pretty badass. Love it.

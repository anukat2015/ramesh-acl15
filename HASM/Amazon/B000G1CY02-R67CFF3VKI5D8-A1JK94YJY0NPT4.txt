Title: Great heater
Content:
My husband and I are very pleased with our space heater. It takes about 10 minutes to warm, it's quiet but extremely efficient in warming our large livingroom that feels drafty during the cold months.  Additionally we love how light in weight it is and how touching the heater will not cause a burn as it does not get that hot.  That's very important to us since we have an infant that soon will be crawling and walking around.  Overall, we highly recommend it.

Title: My wife and I love the machine
Content:
I bought this as a gift for my wife since she loves coffee.  However, costs are high whether at Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts.  I figured this should reduce costs plus don't need to travel to look for Starbucks or DD.
I have this at work so I was already familiar with how it works.  No problems to date and we have been using it for almost a month.  Like others who have made a complaint.  The larger size is really not enough.  It barely fills my cup.  
Finding the k-cups are sale are a challenge but if you check [...], you can pick up some sales.  Actually, I just bought 2 boxes (total 48) of French Vanilla from Amazon for [...] & change.  Sweet deal.  
You will not be disappointed.

Title: Zune Review
Content:
I have owned both an Ipod (2 years) and the Zune (1 year), and in my own opinion the Zune wins hands down.  The screen is bright, and is much better than the ipod.  I haven't had any problems with the software, it seems to work just as good as itunes.  The only downside to the Zune is that it only comes in 30 gig.  As far as durability goes...I have had a acrylic case on it since I bought it, I'm currently deployed to Iraq, and it has stood up to the harshest conditions, as I take it everywhere with me.

I've had my A350 for over a month.  I shot about 400 photos with it over the last weekend.  I've hesitated to use it, due to what I presumed was bad design.  It turns out that my camera has a misaligned viewfinder.  I was having to aim lower, guessing what was the proper place to point at, and then take my shot.  Sometimes I got what I was trying to photograph.  Sometimes the image was cut off.  Looks like this camera is going back for repairs.  After that, who knows, it might be a great camera.

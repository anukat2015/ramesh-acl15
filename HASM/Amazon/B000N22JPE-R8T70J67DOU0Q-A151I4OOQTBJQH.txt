Title: This machine is one I would give anyone
Content:
as a gift and never worry that they wouldn't like it. The machine is for people who really like good, hot coffee and not just brown liquid that has a vaguely coffee-like taste. Did I mention hot? The temp of this coffee is right, not like some coffee machines we all have had that make hot coffee for awhile, then barely hot as time goes by. Also, it's as dependable as any coffee machine I have ever had. In fact it's been so dependable (and still is) I had to smack myself after just buying the Cuisinart DCC-2600 model as a Christmas present-just because I wanted one. I have had this machine for about 4 years and it has been rock solid-even though it has been treated very roughly by two ham-handed clumsy men using it-myself and my son. The issues that some have with this can be solved easily by experience with the appliance, although I never have had any problem from day 1-and have some trouble seeing just exactly what those with complaints are saying. In comparison to other coffee machines in the same price range this one should get SIX stars, from my experience with most of the other brands in the past. I highly recommend this model and couldn't be happier with the performance of it...in all respects. Heck, it even looks good in your kitchen. You won't regret buying this machine and it will give you years of good service. It works so well they'll probably phase it out.

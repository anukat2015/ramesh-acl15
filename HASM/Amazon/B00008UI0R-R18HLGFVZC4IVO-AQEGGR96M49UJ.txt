Title: Great vacuum for older people
Content:
I have used a Kenmore upright for many years. It was heavy and difficult to use. I went with a canister vacuum for ease and this is the best. I know there are probably other vacuums as good or even better. After reading many reviews, I chose this one. This one cleans amazingly. It is easy and has great suction. Watch out for fringes on Tibetan carpets! This vacuum gets everything any where near it. 
My complaints about it are: it has too few attachments and the ones it has are kind of wimpy. They come off easily when vacuuming. Cleaning the dirt container is easy but must be done every time I vacuum.

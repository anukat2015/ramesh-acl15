Title: maybe, maybe not
Content:
I bought the ipod mini from Amazon on September 17, 2005. I used it periodically over the next few months, probably about 50 or so hours total play time. This week, I rediscovered my ipod after not using it since December. I was so excited to be able to listen to podcasts, audiobooks, and music at work that I joined audible.com and started downloading all this great stuff. It's really a great toy to have around to break the tedium of the work day. 
If only it worked. 
After about 50 hours of lifetime use, this unit froze up in the middle of changing tracks and has been stuck on that screen for over 6 hours now. I followed all the troubleshooting stuff on Apple's web site, but to no avail. I was able to put in a support request to send the unit to Apple for replacement. They did charge me about $35 for shipping and handling, even though I am within warranty. Of course, I am not too happy about that, but I forked it over anyway. We will have to wait and see how the company does on their follow through. 
If it wasn't for this one incident, I would say it is a great product, with a nice intuitive interface. Partnering the hardware with i-tunes makes for easy organizing and listening of your audio library.

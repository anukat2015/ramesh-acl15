Title: Getting the job done
Content:
This space heater is perfect for homes with small children.  It is cool to the touch and easy to operate.  It is keeping our bedrooms warm which are directly over our unheated garage of our cap cod home.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is the contols.  They are hard to see and are not intuitive.  You will need to have a light on and be directly in front of the unit to know exactly which setting you are choosing.  A small gripe but a important feature that must be considered if you have poor eye sight.  You cant go wrong with a DeLonghi from my experience.  For the money, its a good bargain and useful product.

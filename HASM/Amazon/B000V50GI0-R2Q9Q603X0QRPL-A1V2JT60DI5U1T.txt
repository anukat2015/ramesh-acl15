Title: Re-consider
Content:
I returned the HCH4051 I got to go under my desk. It was a handy size, and I could probably have dealt with the rather high noise level, but I couldn't handle the smell! Even after running it full-bore for HOURS outside, it still gave off a nasty chemical odor. It smelled like pesticide, like 2,4-D or something. That was unacceptable.

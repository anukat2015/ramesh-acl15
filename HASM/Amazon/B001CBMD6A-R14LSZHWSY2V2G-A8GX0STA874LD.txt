Title: I love this camera!
Content:
This is my first DSLR. I really like it because it's easy to use if you're a beginner and it has some nice features if you want to get into serious photography. The colors in my photos are great and my photos are very crisp and clear. I think the kit lens is fantastic, though I do plan on purchasing a telephoto lens in the near future. I'm still learning about this camera, but so far it is everything I was looking for.

Title: Love it!
Content:
Just a great camera. 
Really good camera for the beginners who want to learn and understand photography. You can still make great pictures in auto mode when you're lazy. And it's easy to use manual modes because interface is really comfortable. And you can see all the explanations of the function there as you use them.
Good results in difficult conditions - bad\no light, sport events e.t.c
Good battery life. Actually never saw a low battery sign even after two days full of pictures. Although I usally don't use flash. 
The camera is light and small compared to other SLR cameras that was really important  for me.
Lense kit is good and light. Although I don't have anything to compare it to.
Love it. One of my best purchases.

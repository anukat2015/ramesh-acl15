Title: Pretty Good...
Content:
Overall it is a pretty good machine. It is a little LOUD and for the large cup of tea (which is the size of any regular mug), you have to press the button for large twice. But overall, it is a pretty good machine. If I had to go back in time, I may not purchase the same model.

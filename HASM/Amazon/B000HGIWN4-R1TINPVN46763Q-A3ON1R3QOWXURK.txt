Title: In transition -- it takes time to learn to use
Content:
It takes time to learn to use this camera -- and I'm still early on the learning curve.  I am definitely not impressed with the new G lenses -- my older 2.8 lenses produce a far clearer image. In short, I probably should have purchased a D200 or waited for the D300.  Regardless of the hype about VR, better have a tripod or monopod at all times when at 200mm telephoto.  The "2 f-stop" claim is either bull, or this camera without VR and a 6.3 lens produces nothing but blur.  Still, it took a bit of time with my F-5 (far, far superior equipment) and I'm willing to try.

Title: This is the best !!
Content:
I checked out all the single serve coffee makers before I bought this.  It has the best variety of coffee available and the large water reservoir is a must if you have a few people in the house drinking coffee.
I still use my regular coffee pot to brew 8 cups for the morning, but this is great for a single cup in the afternoon or after diner.  I never thought I'd have a use for this, but now I wish I had bought it ages ago.

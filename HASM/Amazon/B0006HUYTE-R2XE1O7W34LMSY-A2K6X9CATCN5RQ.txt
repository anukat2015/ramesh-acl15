Title: SOME WHAT CONTENT
Content:
To keep this short but sweet: I looked for months for a canister sweeper and decided on this one due to the reviews. The unit is louder than I thought it would be and there seems to be a strain on the motor. My husband said it was ok. The main long stem to the floor attachment is metal and is heavier than it should be resulting in some problems. I also had to purchase a floor attachment through United Vacum with horse hair brissles (better for my hardwood floors), very pleased.

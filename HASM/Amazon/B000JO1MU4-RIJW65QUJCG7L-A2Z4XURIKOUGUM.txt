Title: My first experiences with an iPod
Content:
This is my first experience using an iPod.  We have a son who designs the top of the line earphones for the iPods.  It is through his interests for us that we purchased a Nano iPod.  I am 80 yrs old and love using this equipment in my woodshop.  I can't say enough good about the whole system.  The earphones are the very best and the Nano is great.  My advice to seniors, get help from your children and grandchildren, as I have done, get to understand and appreciate the wonders of the new technologies out there today.  My wife is a tole painter and loves to listen to the equipment as well.  The ear phones are made by Klipsch and they are the "greatest".  Marvin Blanchard.

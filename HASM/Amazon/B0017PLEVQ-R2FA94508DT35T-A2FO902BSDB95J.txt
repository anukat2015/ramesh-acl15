Title: Best Vacuum On the Market
Content:
We were looking to replace our 3 year old Kenmore canister vacuum and I had done a lot of research on-line and in several leading consumer magazines.  I have bad allergies to dust and pet hair (we have a dog) so I was looking for an upgrade over our Kenmore, which leaks dust, had been in the repair shop twice and was starting to show some wear and tear.  I settled on a Miele vacuum due to their strong reputation for quality, durablity, and good filters.  I ordered through an Amazon partner, Witbeck Vacuums, who didn't have the model I wanted, but immediately upgraded me to the next model up, free of charge.  I got my vacuum, Next Day Air, and sure enough was vacuuming by the following afternoon.  The Miele Aquarius is extremely lightweight, and comes with every feature you can imagine.  I started to vacuum in one room and found myself cleaning our entire house (mix of medium pile carpet, hardwood and tile floors).  I used the various attachments on our drapes, couch, chair and dog bed.  The results are simply amazing and I could not be happier with my purchase.  The dust in our house, after two weeks, has been visibily reduced and the whole house feels cleaner.

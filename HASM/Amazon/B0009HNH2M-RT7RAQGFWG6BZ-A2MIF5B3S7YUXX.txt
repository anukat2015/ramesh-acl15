Title: Mediocre after a year's use
Content:
This vacuum is great when it is new - powerful suction and great flexibility, switching easily from wood floors, tile and carpet.  The tool storage on the handle is not very convenient, but that is not a deal breaker.  
My mother and I each bought a Duros canister vacuum 2 years ago.  Her Duros died after one year, when the hose coupling broke and the repair shop told her not to bother fixing it.  Mine is still working decently, (after my awesome husband, who likes to edit my reviews, did a complete tear-down looking for intermittent power loss only to replace the shorting wall plug) but the suction quality has declined appreciably and the noise has increased appreciably.  It's just not as great anymore.
For the price, it is isn't a bad purchase, but I would not buy this vacuum again.

Title: iPod Nano Generation 5
Content:
I was looking for a replacement for my 6GB iPod Mini which had just died and read about the newest Nano.
I already knew the sound quality would be excellent and the new Nano includes an FM tuner, video camera, pedometer, picture storage/display, voice recorder, external speaker, text viewer and a few games. Most of these won't ever get used, but the FM tuner and picture display are nice additions for me.
Only two minor complaints about the new Nano: it doesn't come with a clip/carrier like the Mini originally did, so I had to buy one and you have to use the ear buds when listening to FM as they serve as the antenna. With the additional storage and features, these are easily ignored.

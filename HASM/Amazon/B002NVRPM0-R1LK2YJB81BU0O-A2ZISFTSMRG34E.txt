Title: Best I've ever had
Content:
I just took the Dyson vacuum cleaner on its maiden trip. And I am very impressed. I grew up with canister cleaners, and have long wanted one again. Never liked those uprights, heavy and hard to get in under furniture etc. The Dyson is easy to handle, cleans really well. A detail, perhaps, but I appreciate that the additional tools (furniture brush etc) are securely fastened. On my old machines they constantly fell off. 
   This almost made vacuuming fun. One possible downside - the canister seems perhaps a little on the small side. It didn't take long for me to fill it up - unless, of course, that is more a statement of what my place looked like before I brought the Dyson home. If it keeps it up - it's surely a five-star!

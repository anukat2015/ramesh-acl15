Title: Horrible Horrible Horrible!.
Content:
This heater is INCREDIBLY LOUD, even if you set it to the lowest setting, it makes no difference.  I bought one these heaters for my parents and they did not even want it because of the superfluous noise and it's poor quality. It takes hours to warm up an enclosed bedroom and it dispenses heat unevenly. You're better off with a basic heater or no heater at all.

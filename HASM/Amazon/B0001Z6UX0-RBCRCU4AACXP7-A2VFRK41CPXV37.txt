Title: Great Space Heater
Content:
We now have three of these units, and they work very well.  We have one in our family room, which is open to the kitchen and it does a good job of warming the whole space.  I don't think it takes up much room at all, has a stable base so I don't worry about it tipping over and is very reliable.  I highly recommend it.

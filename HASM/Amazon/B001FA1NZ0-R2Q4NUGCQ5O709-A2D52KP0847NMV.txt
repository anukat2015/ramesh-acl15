Title: no custom headphones ?
Content:
I'm sure other people have commented about this as well... 4 GB is ok for the price, but no display ?? no custom earphone ?? no buttons on the player ?? what was apple thinking ? 
I was actually hoping they will bring the click wheel to the shuffle 3G, but this one is terrible.

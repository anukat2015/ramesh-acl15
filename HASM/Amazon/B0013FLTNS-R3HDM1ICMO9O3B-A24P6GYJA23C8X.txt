Title: A great product..........if you can afford
Content:
It is a great laptop if you can afford it. The price, to my belief, is still ridiculous high. I spent 1768 in total after the rebate and it is already considered as a great deal.
If you do alot of film/photo/music editing, this is da choice for you. If you are a pc geek who always do P2P freebies, programming and stuff then mac might not be a good choice for you.
The touch pad is a great innovation which that you cannot elsewhere. The new LED screen is also fabulous. The build is solid and metallic look is another plus.
Weight-wise it is heavy but not that heavy for a 15.4" laptop. Heat problem is still there, one should down load a fan controller software always.
4/5

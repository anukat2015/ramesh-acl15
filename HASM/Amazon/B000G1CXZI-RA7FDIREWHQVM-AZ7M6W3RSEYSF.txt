Title: Only a good choice if you have an enclosed space
Content:
I bought the DeLonghi radiator heater because I was looking for something that provided good heat but didn't have the noise associated with fan driven units.  This unit certainly heats up with settings for 500, 700 and 1200 watts but the heat mostly radiates up, not out.  This means that in order to feel the heat, it must gradually heat up the room and if your room isn't enclosed, you don't really feel the heater working.  Since my home is more open, the heater had very little effect.  In fact, I put a thermometer about 4 feet from the unit and after running it all afternoon, the temperature only went up 1 degree.  I couldn't test it in a more enclosed space but I'm guessing it would work better there.  For my needs, I'll go back to a fan driven unit that puts more heat directly into the needed area.

Title: Great laptop, solid performance
Content:
This is my second Sony Vaio, the first which was similar to this was run over by a Tokyo taxi cab.  This one is even better.  Great performance and speed.  I'm using it to run my Slingbox from the US and watch television.  Great picture on the Vaio screen and almost no lag time running wirelessly in my house in the US and then wirelessly in my apartment in Tokyo.  Easy hook up via hdmi cable to big screen tv if I want.  I'm waiting for Windows 7 which should improve the performance even more!  A great buy, especially with the upgrade and a $100 rebate!

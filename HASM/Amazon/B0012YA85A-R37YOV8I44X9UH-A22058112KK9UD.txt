Title: What took so long?
Content:
I've been an "advanced" enthusiast with regard to photography for quite some time and was hesitant to take the plunge (and part with the dollars) into the DSLR field only to find out the cost far outweighed the return.  Well after having the Canon Rebel XSi for only about a week, I am regretting not having made the jump sooner.  This purchase has been well worth the money and while I'm not experienced enough to review all the technical aspects of this product, I can definitely say it's a great entry into the field of DSLR photography if that is the direction you are leaning.  The full auto mode will give you stunning results while you figure out the more advanced settings at your own pace.
I've since purchased the 55-250mm zoom lens and am awaiting delivery so I can further expand my photo options.  It has many great accessories and lenses that you can choose to upgrade with when the time is right.  Amazing camera and I'm completely happy with this purchase!

Title: Great for clean up after the kids
Content:
This is a great hand vac for cleaning up the crumbs after the kids are done eating.  It's easy to clean with it's washable filter and has good suction.  My only gripes are that the opening is a little small and a skittle will not fit, but a cheerio will.  Putting the unit back together after a cleaning takes a little force.

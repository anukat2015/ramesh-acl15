Title: Good one but not perfect
Content:
Picked this one up from Lenovo's Outlet Center for $600 with 3 year in-home warranty.  Based upon the price level, it is not a bad buy at all.  The system is fast and responsive if you set it at High Performance setting.  Here are some thoughts:
Pros:
1. Good processing speed if you have all settings at high;
2. Keyboard is typical Lenovo, good feeling and comfortable;
3. All around business like color (this could be a con to someone);
4. Responsive key pad with ton of selectable settings;
5. Very strong "feet" at the bottom and gives you "safe" feelings;
6. Great specs from 802.11n to bluetooth to webcam.
Cons:
1. Battery life - it's a joke compared to today's 'light and thin' ones;
2. Design: shining cover can easily be scratched and attracts finger prints;
3. Battery Management Software needs retooling;
4. VeriFace software works some of the times but not all and slow under low light;
5. Pretty warm;
6. Surprisingly little updates and patches from Lenovo.
In all not a bad machine if you don't have to pay full price.  Compared with other machines in this price range, the U330 gives you the speed and portability you need.  Most those "thin and light" doesn't have the horse power to multitask the way you are used to on desktops.  However, you had better stay near wall socket because the juice will run out quickly.

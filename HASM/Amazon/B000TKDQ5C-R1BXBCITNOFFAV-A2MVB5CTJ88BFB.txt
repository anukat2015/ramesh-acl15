Title: Ceramic Heater
Content:
I will admit that I was apprehensive when I thought about purchasing this. It was a low price, but the reviews I read were mainly positive. This heater is the answer to the chilly morning when you are the first one out of the bed, and the house is freezing cold. I use it most days and am completely, and thoroughly satisfied. It has a strong heat output. So little, but so powerful--well worth the money. I plan to get another one soon for the next winter season.

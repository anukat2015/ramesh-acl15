Content:
I purchased the 1350us and it works great with Linux.  Currently running OpenSUSE 11.2 and wireless, screen resolution, external screen configuration, web-cam, and the remote control all work out of the box as the hardware has all in-kernel drivers now.
The only funny thing is that every other time you come out of sleep mode the track pad will not work.
Also, a warning to those who wish to virtualize 64 bit operating systems on this - the processor is a t6600, so it does not come with the ability to do so as it lacks VT-x.
Other than that, quite a sold laptop for Linux use.

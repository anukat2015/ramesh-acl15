Title: Poor Quality
Content:
I ordered the T410, along with a docking station, neoprene carrying case,  and headset.  I received the accessories early and the headset which is sold as a specific component for this computer is not compatible with this computer.  Then a week later the computer arrived, two weeks after ordering which I thought was good.  I ordered directly from Lenovo.  With great excitement, fired it up only to find that the display was dead.  Called Lenovo support and while they were nice, they were of no help in solving the problem.  Only solution was to ship it to a repair facility and they would have it back to me in 2 weeks.  Instead, I returned it and ordered an HP 8440p today.  Hopefully I will have better luck.  One would think Lenovo would at least turn these units on before shipping them!

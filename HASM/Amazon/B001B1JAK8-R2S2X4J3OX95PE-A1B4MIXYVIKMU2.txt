Title: Slim, Sexy, and Powerful... A True Classic
Content:
When it comes to computers, Dell has had a pretty good reputation for "build quality" in their products. But, they also have a reputation for notoriously bad "customer service".  One thing that I never expected from Dell was a laptop that was not only built well, but also a real "head-turner" . But that's exactly the case when it comes to the Dell M1330 laptop. This sleek and sexy 4 pound high-end (XPS line) laptop packs a formidable punch and offers a cool array of features & options. These features include an 13.3" LED backlit screen (LED backlight optional), slot loading optical drive, brushed aluminum casing, biometric finger print reader (optional), Media player with travel remote (optional), integrated camera, HDMI out, Solid state hard drive 'SSHD' (optional),  and a good selection of laptop colors to choose from. To finish it off, it features powerful CPU choices ( from 1.66Ghz to 2.5Ghz "Core 2 Duo" Intel Processors) and an optional 128mb NVIDIA GeForce Graphics Card. But along with the good, there are a few things that keep this laptop from being perfect. One thing that I really wished this laptop had was more than just 2 USB ports. Not only that, but the ports are on opposite sides of the computer.  Also, there isn't even an option for buying an integrated Blu-ray drive... which doesn't make any sense when you see that there's a beautiful 13.3 wide-screen and HDMI port on this thing. 
Still, there's a lot to love about the Dell M1330. It's ultra portable/super thin wedge shape design, full-sized keyboard, and built-in memory card slot, integrated web-cam & mic, and 2 headphone jacks,  also adds to it's intrinsic value and charm. Few laptops can match both it's 'power per size' ratio. And although it's been available now for a couple years, it can still hold it's own among some of the newer laptops on the market.  And when it's all said and done, I think that it makes this Dell a true "classic"... especially now that Dell has discontinued this model. It can still be acquired "new or used" on sites like Ebay, through Dell's online Outlet store, and other online sources. It's also still available at some retail stores. 
Pros:
-Beautiful glossy 13.3" wide screen (also available with LED backlight)
-Great super portable, sleek, light, and sexy design.
-Powerful (up to 2.5GHz Core 2 Duo and 128mb NVIDIA GeForce Video Card option)
-Nice array of colors available including "Blue, Pink, White, Black, and Red"
-Slot Loading Optical drive
-Wide array of hard drive options including SSHD, easy to DIY hard drive upgrade as well. 
Cons:
-Only 2 USB drives
-No Blu-ray Option
-Standard 6-cell battery doesn't last too long (about 2 hrs) Don't even bother with 3-cell batt.
-9 Cell battery available but it's very expensive and adds much bulk to laptop.(sticks out too)
Conclusion:
This is a sexy and powerful high-end ultra-portable laptop. I've heard that it was rated the most powerful laptop per it's size (when it was first released) ...But this may not be true anymore. The XPS line of Dell laptop has a higher build quality than most regular consumer laptops on the market. And because the prices for this model has drastically dropped (now that it's been discontinued), it's even more of a bargain. Mine has been very dependable and I'd highly recommend it to others.

Title: Best personal heater I've ever used!
Content:
This inexpensive little personal heater has a lot of great features that you don't find with other models in the same price range.  First of all, in addition to the high-low setting that most heaters have, there is also a specific thermostat setting that lets you choose amongst five different temperatures (I believe the degree choices are 60-65-70-75-80).  Secondly, the heater is self-adjusting, so once the room reaches the desired temperature, the heater turns off, only to come back on if the temperature dips back down.  This heater has a nice swivel feature which allows you to angle it in different directions without having to move the entire unit.  Finally, it is one of the smallest, quietest, most lightweight space heaters you will find!  I use it in my basement exercise room, where it works perfectly, but it would also be great for bedrooms, offices, and other small rooms.  Highly recommended!!!

Title: This is the best portable heater available.
Content:
Simply put, quartz heaters warm the people in a room rather than blowing a lot of air around. 
We've used this type of heater for over 20 years and never been disappointed. With minimum care, they last forever...we've never had to replace a quartz tube, for instance.
For best performance, remove the grate when the heater is cool and clean dust from the quartz tubes with a soft, damp cloth.
 
This particular brand and model is the best yet...
I bought two for my son's apartment because his gas bill was outrageous.  
He uses one in his bedroom and keeps one where ever his friends gather~kitchen, den, etc.  
He could not be more pleased.

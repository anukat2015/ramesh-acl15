Title: A Great Computer
Content:
An awesome laptop! My hp was old and running slow, so I decided to move up and get a new one. I saw this on sale and had to have it! It has been several months now and sony has not disappointed. It runs great, is very fast, and is pink to boot. Also the lcd screen is great, a really clear picture, and shows movies crystal clear. If you want a great computer for a great price this is the one for you!

Title: Well....it was four
Content:
The machine works great (well for a beginner anyhow, I'm not a pro:) - I'm happy with it so far...a little long to steam but worth the wait. My 2 constant problems were shortages on both shipments (I returned the first due to shortages and not working properly). I absolutely love my machine but I am still to this date having problems getting my replacement piece (with Krups not Amazon). Since everything works and its one of the filters missing I decided to keep the machine and wait it out for the part. In short great machine if you get all of the parts.
that was when i first recieved the second unit:
well....cut to a few uses later and the machine does not work properly! tons of water when the steam comes out and barely heats the milk. i thought i'd wait it out becuase it seemed to have worked in the beginning but not so now and I still haven't been able to get a filter!
i highly recommend that you do not buy this machine! nothing but problems. I have returned the unit and am waiting for my new machine to come in - no its not a Krupps! I'd be hard pressed to ever by a Krupps product again - due to constant shortages, lack of caring customer support and a machine that has failed in two units.

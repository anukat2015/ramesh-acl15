Title: Fantastic!
Content:
The last time I was into photography was back in the early 80's; I had a Canon AE-1 (still have it packed away somewhere). The hobby got away from me somewhere in the early 90's. Now that I have a new baby running around the house, I thought it would be a good time to invest in new technology again. I read everything I could about the various pro/consumer cameras out there; many articles supported the Rebel XT as a solid bet. I went back to what I knew from history - Canon. My new Rebel XT is - simply put - Fantastic! Great quality/performance to price ratio. Very foregiving for amateurs like me. Produces amazing results under just about any lighting conditions, and has fast performance characteristics which allows me to capture multiple pictures of fast moving subjects like my 14 month old boy as he runs around the house, splashes in the pool or plays at the park.
You will really enjoy this camera.

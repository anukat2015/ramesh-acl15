Title: Great entry level camera, not quite at a Nikon level
Content:
I have two Sony a200 and a Sony a300. In addition I have a Nikon D40, D40x, D50 and D300.  The Sony a200 and a300 have the same sensor as the Nikon D40x/D60 however they seem to focus a little slower.  Here are some strengths and weaknesses about the camera.
Strengths
- Image stabilization (SteadyShot)
- Kit lens is 18-70mm versus 18-55mm like Nikon and Canon
- Solid feel/construction
- Easy to use
- Uses older Minolta Alpha Mount lenses which can be found at a reasonable price on Amazon, eBay, Craigslist....
- Kiy lenses arepretty decent, heard otherwise about Canon (I am also a Nikon guy)
Weaknesses
- Sony (rather than Nikon or Canon), people won't mistake you for a pro
= Focus is a little slow
= Compact Flash cards rather than SD which are less expensive
- No affordable Prime lenses (e.g. 50mm)
- Harder to locate accessories

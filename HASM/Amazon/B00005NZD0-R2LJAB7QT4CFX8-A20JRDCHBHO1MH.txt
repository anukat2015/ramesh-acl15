Title: Works great
Content:
After reading many reviews and recommendations, and getting discouraged that one could not buy a good cappuccino maker for cheap, I didn't buy anything.  But when I saw this model hugely discounted at a local store, I went ahead and bought it.  Am I ever glad!  It would have been well worth full price.  It froths the milk extremely well, the espresso tastes great, it's easy to use, the coffee maker works well.  I've had it about a month and have no complaints.  And Krups customer service is great:  I bought an open-box model that was missing parts, and they sent all the accessories to me totally free, no hassles at all.  One-year warranty.

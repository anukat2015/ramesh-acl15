Title: Nikon D3000
Content:
This is a great Digital Camera. I own the Nikon D80 and wanted to get a DSLR for my wife as she has been interested in photography. 
This camera is a little smaller and very easy to use. We really enjoy the on screen programing on the back of the camera. The D3000 does not come with the live view but that really does not make a difference as if you are taking real photos you want to use the viewfinder and not live view. The quality of the picture are very good and very comparable to the D80. We like the ease of use and the best part is that the lens are interchangeable so we did not have to go out and spend a $1000 on new lens. If you really want a great camera that will work for most amateur or semi pros this is a great camera. It takes great pictures, easy to use and is very fast. It size really makes it a very easy to carry around too. Battery life is incredible, over 600 shots outside. I actually find myself using it more that my D80 when I am just running around taking shots.

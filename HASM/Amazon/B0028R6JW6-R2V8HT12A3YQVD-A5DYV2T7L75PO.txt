Title: Slim & Sleek!
Content:
I love this laptop.  I've had it for a month now, and have no complaints.  It's perfect for travel, yet the screen size is suprisingly generous since it's a widescreen.  The keyboard is not too small and it's processing is decent. I watch videos and often multitask with emails with no problem.  Sound is great.  I've had a few people ask if it was a macbook air.  ::shrug:: 
I researched for hours for a new laptop, with my priority ranking being 1) super light  2) not a tiny screen 3) decent processing 4) pretty.  This laptop met all 4 requirements.

Title: Good quality and OS X.
Content:
This is my first Macbook pro. At first, I'm really not used to the control. After a while, I like it a lot, especially the quality. The screen is very good and really save power. Although some applications only support Windows, I just install Parallels on OS X and install Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit and other windows applications. It works great. Even I can develop programs using Visual Studio 2008. I don't need to reboot using BootCamp.

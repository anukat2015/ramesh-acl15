Title: Great Laptop with some drawbacks
Content:
This laptop was not my first choice when I was looking to purchase.  I would have preferred the Asus UL series notebooks but the one I wanted was not in stock.  Unfortunately I am going to be returning this laptop as its wireless NIC has extremely limited range leading me and toshiba(tech support) to believe that it has a faulty wireless nic.  If the the wireless NIC had worked from the start I would have kept this laptop.  Has anyone else gotten a laptop with a bad wireless nic?
I would recommend this laptop if it comes to you in working condition :).  It comes at a great price point... 
Aesthetically this laptop is quite pleasing, it matches my iphone with its silver trim and black high gloss finish.  It is a fingerprint magnet.  The white edition would make the keys easier to see in low light conditions.
I haven't done any rigorous testing or anything other than browsing with 5+ windows open, but it has performed quite well so far with my limited use.
The usb sleep and charge feature is quite handy when you are travelling but need to recharge another device using the machines battery.  
The Screen is bright and sharp and I am quite pleased with it.  Sound is weak without pumping up the smart audio equalizer settings which will lead to stress of your tiny laptop speakers.
It puzzles me that Toshiba chose to include windows 7 32bit edition when this laptop has a max ram capacity of 8g when the OS does not take advantage of this.  
I read a caption from another that summarized this laptop up quite well, you can do alot worse than buying this laptop ;).

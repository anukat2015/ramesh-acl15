Title: I really want to like it, but...
Content:
The look and feel of this laptop is great and I really really want to like it, but the battery life is absolutely horrific. I expect at least 4 hours of solid use out of a thin and light. This thing averages barely 2.5 hours off a full charge with the screen set at the dimmest level. The worst part...the battery takes 4 HOURS to charge. Absolutely absurd. If you don't mind ALWAYS having your power cord, go ahead and buy this comp.

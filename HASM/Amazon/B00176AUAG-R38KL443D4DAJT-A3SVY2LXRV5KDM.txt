Title: Don't buy it, call Dyson
Content:
This is a generic hose that fits a Dyson, not the same hose that comes directly from Dyson.  It is not as heavy/durable as a real Dyson hose.  It broke within just a few uses.  I called the company who did not want to replace it, but I "badgered" them until they agreed to send another hose - which also broke within 3 months!  I recommend you call Dyson directly and explain the problem you're having with your hose.  They may be able to replace it for you at no cost.  If not, spend the extra $15 and buy a hose from the Dyson website.

Title: Beautiful to look at, makes excelent coffee
Content:
This is the most beautiful coffee maker ever made. Its design is simple, yet functional, and provides an original and ingenious way to make coffee.
There are no pumps, presses, or other gadgets. Here you brew coffee the way it was originally made, stirring hot water and coffee. The shape is not only elegant, but NEVER EVER drips. 
Quality is the best I've seen ever. It leaves everything else in the dust.

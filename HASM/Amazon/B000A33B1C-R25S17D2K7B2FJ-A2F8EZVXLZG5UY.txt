Title: Great efficient heater
Content:
Firstly, oil-filled heaters are great for their efficiency compared to simple electric heaters. This Delonghi does the job with its 3 heat settings and thermostat adjustment. 
The timer is pretty good, allowing you to customize when you want to turn it on and off on a regular basis. For example, you could set it to turn on at 7am, turn off at 9am, and then it would come back on at 5pm and turn off at 11pm. You could even have it turn on for lunch in addition- it's totally flexible. The down side of my heater is that the timer dial with its little plastic slots for each time period started making a little noise. The timer slowly spins and I think it is slightly vibrating causing the noise. I can zone out the noise, but it is a bit annoying. Other than that, it makes no noise. Plus it is safe from a heat point of view, i.e. you won't burn yourself on it. Nice to have the wheels to move it out of its spot during the warm months and put into storage.
I'd love to have it replaced, but I don't have the patience to take this heavy object to the post office and sent back for possible repairs. Maybe there is a return policy/replacement policy but I'm too lazy to look into that.
Just being honest. Overall a great heater, but a mild sound annoyance.

Title: Great vac!  Great price!
Content:
I searched all over the web for a bagless canister vacuum and decided on this Hoover.  Great choice.  It's not too expensive and although I selected free shipping with the order, it was delivered within 3 days - that's fast!
The plastic on the canister is a bit cheesy and the power cord doesn't always completely retract, but there is a handle on top for easy carrying and stair cleaning.  It's rather quiet compared to other brands, but it's a vacuum - it makes noise.
The power controls are conveniently located on the handle with an on/off carpet/bare floor switch and 3 suction speeds, the highest having great suction cleaning to really get the job done.  Better turn that baby down or it will suck in your drapes!
The telescopic wand seems sturdy and is neat for either short or tall people while the motorized brush is heavy enough for deeper canister vac cleaning.  There is also a bare floor attachment which does not come with many other bagless canister models.
Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and recommend it to anyone wanting a good vacuum for an economical price.

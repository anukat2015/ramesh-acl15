Title: Beautiful Pictures
Content:
I decided to buy a DSLR after seeing pictures I took with a friend's DSLR.  I did my research and decided to get the 50D along with a Canon 17-55mm f/2.8 lens, a Canon 70-200mm f/4 lens and a Speedlite 580EX II.  Six months later, I am still learning how to use it all.  However, I have already taken pictures that I will cherish for the rest of my life!

Title: iRiver iFP 799T 1gb MP3 player
Content:
Overall good player. Download quality could be better. "Any source" recording is somewhat difficult to use, poor quality. Computer software is hard to understand at first, seems restrictive. On occasion static is heard in the music, unsure where it originates. Seems better than the iPod.

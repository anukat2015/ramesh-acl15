Title: A Backpackers dream
Content:
Back in the day I used to pack a 4x5 view camera out into the woods. Now my 57 year old back says whoa! Are you nuts?
 A D40 with the kit lens and say a 10-20 Sigma is a knockout combination for someone more photographer than pack mule.
 6.1 megapixels is plenty to do flawless 13x19 prints and if you don't need bracketing or wireless flash then why pay for them?
 This is a great dual purpose camera. A lot of pros will be taking these on vacation and hanging on to them as backups at work.
 This is now the camera I recommend to friends who want more than a point and shoot but don't want to mortgage the house for a camera.
 $600 for a camera that shoots like a D70 (maybe even a little bit better) with a good lens is amazing. NEF's off this are perfectly fine for 90% of the photography going on out there.
 Nikon has hung the moon.

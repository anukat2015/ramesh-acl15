Title: Great a/c unit...
Content:
I own a small (400 sq ft) house and had visited local stores to purchase a unit that was efficient and cheap.  I did a little research before this purchase and settled on this Haier unit.
It is a great little cooling machine, yes, it is a little noisy.  But, it does a great job and I couldn't be happier with it.

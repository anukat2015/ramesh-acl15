Title: Great little heater. Well built. Good safety features.
Content:
Nice looking heater. Has optional 4 hour auto shutoff. I'm partial to quartz heaters. Gives a nice orange fireplace glow. My dog gives it two paws up, she likes to lie in front of it. Only one setting (1000w) on this one. No fan, so its completely silent. I'll probably buy another one or two of these for individual room supplemental heating, so I can keep the rest of the house a bit cooler.

Title: disappointed in patton product
Content:
i purchased this item because of unseasonably cold weather in south fl.i own two patton heaters purchased some years ago,one at k mart, the other at target.both seem well built and have worked very well. most stores were sold out of space heaters,so amazon.com seemed like a good alternative. i have no problem with amazon.com or the seller, [...]. the product was shipped promptly and boxed very well.the problems with the new heater were,top two sheet metel screws to attach the handle fell thru the pre drilled holes, two of six screws holding the back housing on were stripped out, two of four rivets attaching the fan motor housing had pulled out. i compared the other two heaters i bought years ago to the new one,the one difference was machine screws holding the top handle on, not sheet metal screws. i needed the heater so i repaird the problems myself. bottom line is i never again will buy patton products [unless they start manufacturing there product in the U. S. A. as they should be]. I do not recommend this product.

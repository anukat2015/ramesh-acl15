Title: New life for old Nikon lenses
Content:
Owning a set of old Nikon E Series lenses gave me a good reason to buy a camera I very much desired but could not justify-a Panasonic DMC-G1. My new outfit includes Nikon E 28f28, 50f18, and 100f28 lenses and a Tokina AT-X 2885 zoom lens. Each of the four Nikon mount lenses requires the use of a Nikon to m4/3 adapter purchased separately. A 1445 lens came with the G1. I am very pleased with the camera and the kit lens and the E Series lenses whose sizing is ideal for the m4/3 camera.

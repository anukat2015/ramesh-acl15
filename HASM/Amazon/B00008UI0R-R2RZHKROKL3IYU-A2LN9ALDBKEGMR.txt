Title: works great - can't beat it for the price
Content:
We've had our vacuum for a month now and we love it. It works great and pulled a scarey amount of stuff out of the carpet the first time we used it. I like that you can empty the dust "cup" everytime if you want and see what you collected (I know, gross, but still I can't help but be fascinated by it!) plus it was so much cheaper than a Dyson and seems to clean equally as well, based on what my mum says (She has a Dyson).   We use it on tile and carpet and it works well in both places.  I like how easy it is to change the length of the handle.  The hose is quite thick and can be a pain if it gets a kink in it, but if you keep it straight it works well.  
We would definitely buy this vaccuum again.

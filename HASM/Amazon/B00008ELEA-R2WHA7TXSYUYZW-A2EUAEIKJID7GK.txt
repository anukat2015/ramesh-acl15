Title: Perk is King!
Content:
Got this little monster at Sears on a blow-out for $25, and never looked back-- last one at the store too!
The coffee this makes is rich, strong, aromatic, delicious and HOT.  I like cool coffee, so I kill the power, pour a cup and wait awhile, but for those that like it hot, you can't get any hotter coffee than this.  It makes the best coffee I've ever had, and all I'm using in it is pre-ground Folgers and Maxwell House.  Every time I use this rascal, I have fun.  Even cleaning it is fun, due to the anticipation of how good the coffee is going to smell and taste.
I could go on and on about how much I prefer percolated to drip-- no comparison really.  I could also go on and on about how much I love this little machine and all it does for me, but why bother?  So I'll just list out the things that kept me from giving this unit 5 Stars:
1. I love the glass domes on the top of most such makers.  This just has a handle.  Not as much fun.
2. The top is a bit hard to remove, but you could always push the prongs on the side of the lid in a bit to relax the tightness.
3. The cord is too short.
4. An exterior level indicator would have been nice.
5. I'm sick of things being made in China.  One day that is going to KILL the US economy.
Other than that, you can't go wrong with this model.  Superb coffee.  Robust little maker.  It's my favorite new pet!  And for this Amazon price of $30, you can't go wrong.  You could spend more on that in a week at Starbucks with their nasty coffee!
BTW, I timed this using the 7-cup marker (half between the 6 and 8 notch), and it took about 8 minutes.  So, darn close to a cup a minute.  I wish it took longer, since the percolating is quite entertaining.

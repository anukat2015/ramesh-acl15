Getting a bagless vac made me uncomfortable as I do floors almost daily, having 7 animals in the house. It has worked out fine, and not wasting bags and cost of filters is a real plus. The vac has great suction which is adjustable. And the upholstery attachment works nicely. The only drawback that I encounter is with the low weave area rugs that I have throughout the house. Having to switch back and forth with the carpet head is a pain. If you're looking for a lightweight vac that can do the basics, this is a good one.

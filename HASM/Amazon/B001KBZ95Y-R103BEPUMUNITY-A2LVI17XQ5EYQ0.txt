Title: It Dribbles
Content:
Mr Coffee has been making coffee pots for awhile, so I thought I could just trust the brand name and get a good coffee pot.  That assumption proved to be false.  The main thing I was seeking in a coffee pot is a pot that does not dribble from the glass pot when you pour it.  I have entertained the idea that it is somehow my fault that some coffee pots dribble when I use them, and in that vein have conducted experiments in which I changed the angle and speed of pouring.  All I want is for all the coffee to go into the cup, and not dribble down the side of the pot and on to the kitchen counter.  It does not seem like too much to ask!  I have come to the conclusion it is not me, at least with this coffee pot,  and that there is likely a design flaw in play.
Speaking of design flaws, I have also noticed that this coffee pot accumulates a lots of moisture in the inside top of the coffee pot.  If you do not wipe it down between uses, it will sometimes create a small stream of old water that will dribble down when you open the lid to make a fresh pot of coffee.
If I ever find a coffee pot that says "Guaranteed not to dribble!" I will definitely give it a try.  This is not that coffee pot.  Not recommended.

Title: very pleased
Content:
I am overall very pleased with this camera- I am somebody who just wanted to take very fast and exceptional pics of my 1 year old, and this camera does that. I did an outlandish amount of research (specs, price etc) before purchasing this, an overall am very pleased. It's quick, takes amazing shots, and....is quick.  My goal was instantaneous picture taking capabilities... and for the price this has worked out. Do I have more features than I truly need? probably- but eventually I will learn to use them. As for now, when my one year old is smiling for a second, I am most of the time able to capture it and not miss out on the pic (although one year olds are quick!), when with my previous camera I would've missed it. 
I'm a Canon fan, always have been, always will be. Canon is quality  and durable, and so far I am happy with the purchase.

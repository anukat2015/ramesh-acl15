Title: Heats well, takes up little space
Content:
After moving to the northwest last winter and spending over $600/month on propane to heat our large (3600 sqft) home, we put one of these in our master bedroom this fall (along with other space heaters elsewhere). Last winter we slept with the bedroom fireplace on, and the main heater cycling on throughout the night. Still, the bathroom was chilly. We chose this for our bedroom because it is silent. In autumn, the DeLonghi worked well set at low (750w), with no fireplace and no main heater. Now that it's gotten really cold, we've cranked it up to full power. Our bedroom stays toasty warm, and just as important, the marble floors of our ensuite bathroom are comfortable. Our propane bill has plummeted, saving us over $300/month, even with the increase in electric use from this and the other heaters we've placed around the house. 
Like oil-filled heaters, this unit doesn't heat quickly, but once the room is comfortable, let it run and you'll be warm all winter. If you want to walk into a cold room, turn on the heater and be warm in a few minutes, this is not your heater. If you want constant, comfortable heat and zero noise, this is as good as it gets.

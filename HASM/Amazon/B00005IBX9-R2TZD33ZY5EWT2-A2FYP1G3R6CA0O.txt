Title: Great Coffee Everytime
Content:
I purchased this for my hubby for father's day and it has never failed to exceed our expectations once.  My hubby drinks coffee every day and he loves this model.  He had spent years with cheap coffeemakers and I finally got him out of that tradition.  I love the stainless steel look, which blends nicely with our other appliances.  I have read some of the other reviews and I was surprised at some of the complaints.  It sounds as if some are just being a bit nit-picky, but that is just my opinion.  If you are looking for great home-brewed coffee, then look no further!

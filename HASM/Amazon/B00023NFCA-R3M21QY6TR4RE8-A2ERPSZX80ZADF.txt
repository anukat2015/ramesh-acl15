Title: Awesome digital SLR camera
Content:
Wow, this is one great camera.  Great built, made in Malaysia.  The camera feels sturdy and fits snuggly in my palms.  I was afraid that this camera will be heavy as heck since on paper Canon touts that their cameras are lighter and more suitable for traveling and such.  I have not carried it on a long trip yet but initial impression on this camera is that while it may be heavier than other cameras, it's still a manageable weight for a 160-pound guy like myself.  This is my first digital SLR camera.  I have shot great photos with a Canon S400 but I feel it's time that I upgrade.  I had wavered between a Canon rebel XT, Canon 20D, and this baby.  Since I have a couple of Minolta lenses already, and supposedly this camera is in the same class as the 20D, this would be a more cost-effective solution without too much sacrifice on image quality.  The stock lens is horrible and feels like a piece of plastic toy.  Don't pay more than $20 for it.  I have a Sigma 28-300mm lens and it works great.  No incompatibility issues.  Great image quality.  Still need more time to read the manual to figure out what all the buttons do but it would be fun.  2.5" LCD is very clear.

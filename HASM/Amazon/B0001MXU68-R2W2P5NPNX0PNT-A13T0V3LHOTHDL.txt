Title: Great Little Brewer
Content:
This is a great Machine.  No Leaks, no problems.  Makes an excelent cup of coffee or tea in a flash.  The only problem for me is the coffee.  All coffee & tea is an individual taste, but the coffee that came with this machine was not worth drinking.  I found both Folgers and Millstone to taste much better.  Pods from Millstone & Folgers are actually made for the Senseo, but fit with a little persuasion.
The tea that Melitta provides gets a great for two out of three.  The Black tea tastes straight from Lipton, but the other two are really good.  
The biggest problem is that Most pods from other manuyfacturers are made for the Senseo, but they do fit.  I am willing to try a few more flavors, but cannot recommmend any of the Melitta Coffees.

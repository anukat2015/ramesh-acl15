Title: Great quality and features and fits our needs for the baby's room
Content:
If you have a baby, you know they cant sleep with blankets, but keeping an entire house at 70c can get expensive.  The kids room is 15x13.  We can now keep the house at about 63.  At the lowest setting (1 out of 3) the room stays above 70.  The first night we got it, we set it at 2 and the room got to 75, and the kid was pretty sweaty.  We had to leave the door half open so it doesnt get too hot.
A nice feature is the 24 hour on-off dial timer.  We are playing with it to find the sweet spot.  For example, you can have it on for 1 hour, then off for 30 minutes, then back on for an hour.  We have only had it for a week, but we're hoping the electricity spent running the unit, is less than it would be to keep the furnace blasting.  Since we only need it on the lowest wattage, I'm guessing it will.  Will try to remember to update this when we get our utility bill.
The construction is a pretty thick metal and it feels solid.  I would advise that you get a room thermometer to help you determine the optimal/economical settings for your room.  The unit does not have one.  I'm sure the more expensive units will have a digital thermostat so you dont have to worry about it, but for the price of this unit (I think it just went down, we got ours for $77) you cannot beat it.

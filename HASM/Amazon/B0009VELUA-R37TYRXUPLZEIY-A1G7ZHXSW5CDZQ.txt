Title: Needs some lights
Content:
I like the coffee maker, however I wish it had a light at the dispenser as it is hard to see when my cup is filled. I would have liked a light on the glass water filling tube and coffee remaining site. The maker does make fast, hot and delicious coffee.A few lights and I think the Cuisinart  Dcc- 2000, Coffee On Demand would have easily had 5 stars.

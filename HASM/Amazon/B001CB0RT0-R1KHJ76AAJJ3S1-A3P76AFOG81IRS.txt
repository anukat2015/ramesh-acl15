Title: ~ 12 hours battery life
Content:
I ordered Zen X-Fi 2 Creative Labs Zen X-Fi 2 8 GB MP3 and Video Player with Touchscreen and Built-In Speaker (Black and Silver) but Amazon sent me this X-Fi Creative Zen X-Fi 8 GB Video MP3 Player with Built-In Speaker (Black/Silver) so before sending back, I tested out a few days. Playback with speaker for music is only about 12 hours and before 13th hour, it completely turned off. I tested this way twice. Of course, I fully charged before each test. I played only mp3 files as I don't want to play movies from this tiny screen. Sound quality is OK for personal use. There are 13 buttons on this tiny player and only 9 are working buttons. I don't understand the person who designed this player... the lock and power on/off button is at the back of player. If you intend to keep in a sleeve/case, be prepared.

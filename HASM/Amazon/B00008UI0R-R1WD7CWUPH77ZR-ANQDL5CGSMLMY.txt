I have now bought 3 of these vac's the first for my mother, then my sister Kathy and now Lisa. They all 3 love the Vac. We have a golden Retriever and is always shedding. This vac does a great job keeping up with the hair. The only thing is that you have to keep the hepa filter clean. And this means a good washing which means you have to let dry. The cost of a spare hepa filter used to be half the cost of a new vac. I now have 4 on order at $20 each. It will not last for 25 years but I did not spend $2500.00 ether.

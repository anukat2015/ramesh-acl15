Title: Great item, but still not what it should be
Content:
160G is still, I have to say, not enough storage - hopefully in a year Apple will figure out how to get it to 500G.
The iPods are great mp3 players for traveling with music, and for the vast amount of accessories for them - car adapters, "boomboxes", armbands, connectivity to home stereos, and so forth.
If all one wants is an mp3 player, though, there are cheaper models that play just fine. The iPod, in my opinion, is only a viable option if one is really going to take advantage of the extra features (watching videos, looking at pictures, and if you have a real need to see the album cover artwork as you listen to music) and the array of accessories. They're way too expensive for just listening while jogging or working out.
I'm also disappointed that Apple continues to offer only a 1-year warranty. I would like to see Apple become more convinced of the quality of their product. 1-year warranties make me feel that they really don't stand behind what they make. We've gotten car manufacturers to actually stand behind their products for years and tens of thousands of miles; why can't Steve Jobs do the same?
Still, the iPods are, as I said, great machines, and it's good to see - finally - something with more storage, and some more bells and whistles, even they aren't really necessary. They are easy to use, synch instantly and without trouble (for most people) to computers, transfer files easily, easy to navigate with the wheel, feel great in the hand, etc.
As to the black iPod, my only caveat of this one, though they look really, really cool, is that they show fingerprints like a neon sign on a dark night.

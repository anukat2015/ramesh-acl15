Title: I love this mp3 player
Content:
I bought the Zen vision m 30 gig in December of 2007, it was a replacement of the same which stopped working after 60 days..I took the chance and replaced it with the same. I have not had one day of problems with this mp3 player, I use it while working out at the gym, walking, I play it through the audio system in my car and with a jack I picked at radio shack I can play it from my home stereo system..can u ask for more, i have photos stored on it and loads of music! I paid around $299 at that the time and tried IPOD before repurchase of this zen and hands down it was a better option in my opinion..IPOD a little thinner..not an issue for me. I have used the fm radio on zen also not the best radio...I would only use it in emergency ??? The battery life is ok I charge 2 times a week average...I use it alot! and I can play it while charging in the car, I also like the software program. I would recommend this to everyone who likes to have audio on the go.

Title: Good vacuum
Content:
I havent had the vacuum long but it does work really well.  It has great suction and was inexpensive.  Drawbacks are the container for dirt is small so it requires emptying frequently and that it is difficult to use on stairs.  Due to the position of the stair attachment, you cannot leave the canister at the top of the stairs while vacuuming.  Its a bit heavy to be holding while vacuuming the top stairs.

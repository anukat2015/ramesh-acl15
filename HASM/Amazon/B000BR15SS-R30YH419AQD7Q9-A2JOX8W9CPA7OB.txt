Title: Surprisingly good!
Content:
I am a self proclaimed coffee snob with the tastes of Starbucks, coffee and high-end Cuisinart and Krups makers.
The price was so good at walmart on this one, I had to try it - and I'd been looking for a cute little 4 cup, so I could have caffinated in one pot and decaf in another. 
Had tried Mr coffee in the past and not liked it. Got it home an made my 1st 4 cups. It brewed a perfect pot, without leaks. The caraffe poured with no spills on the counter.
Cheap, small, cute, lightweight and brews a good pot. I am pleased

Title: Very easy to use, excellent results. love it
Content:
Excellent camera at this price. Very easy to use with 15 scene modes and detailed information in the preview helps starters to learn the best settings required. Total manual modes also easy to handle. Light weight compared to other SLRs. Would highly recommend for amateur photographers.

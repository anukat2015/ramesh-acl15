Title: Never buy anything from apple
Content:
My son worked for 3 months to buy this with his own money. When he got it, it wouldn't work on our computer after 2 trips to the apple store their so called geniuses figured out that we were sold a used i pod and it had some water damage, but that isn't covered under the 1 year warrenty, so he is stuck with a broken i pod that he never got to use. They are a huge company and they don't care about the small people who are actually breaking their backs trying to find the money to buy their stuff. Plus we bought this from walmart and they wouldn't take it back either even though it was used when we bought it.

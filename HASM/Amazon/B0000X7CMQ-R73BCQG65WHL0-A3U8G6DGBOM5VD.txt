Title: Works Great
Content:
This coffee maker has proved to me that the temperature of the coffe during brewing makes a difference.  It brews hot, stays hot and tastes great.  some have mentioned the controls on the side, but I just look at it as having a side-mounted brew station.  
The only change I would suggest is that there should be a slot to sore the cap that plugs the inlet where the coffee enters the pot.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, the coffee comes out of the filter cup into the pot through a hole in the top of the pot.  That hole does not close when the pot is removed.  There is an extra little cap that you use to plug the hole.  There is no place to store that cap while the coffee is brewing.  It tends to get lost on the counter top.  (I've drilled a small hole in the cover of the brewer.  The plug in the small cap snaps into the hole and keeps the cap handy.)

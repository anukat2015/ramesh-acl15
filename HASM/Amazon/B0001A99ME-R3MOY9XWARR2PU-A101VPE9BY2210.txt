Title: yeah i love it but...
Content:
...i agree with some other reviewers about the colour. i got a pink mini iPod today for christmas but (don't get me wrong this is like its only fault) the colour shown in pictures on the apple website and amazon is totally NOT what it really looks like. its kind of a darkish lilac colour, which is really cute but not what i expected.
i love everything about my iPod mini (especially the music quiz - it ROCKS!). i've got 474 songs on it already!
a perfect christmas present! :)
UPDATED:
my mini was working just fine then one day i plugged it into my computer to add some new songs to it and it keeps telling me "no iPod connected" and won't update it. has this happened to anyone else??? what can i do?
UPDATED AGAIN:
we rang the apple hotline and they were very helpful (even if it took hours to actually get through to a person not a machine) and told me all i needed to do was reset my mini!

Title: Happy With Ipod Shuffle
Content:
First Ipod I have owned and I love it!  I rec'd it from my husband as a Christmas gift 2008.  I like the clip, so I don't have to hunt for an arm band.  The only drawback is I want to purchase all my favorite songs at once! I would recommend this to anyone.  I will have to buy different ear phones 'cause these just don't fit very well.  This was a perfect gift!

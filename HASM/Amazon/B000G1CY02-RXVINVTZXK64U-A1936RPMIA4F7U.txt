Title: Delonghi - Beats the cold of 18 degrees
Content:
For years I've had 2 heaters in my Glass Patio/Sun Room (15 X 14 ft).  We've been able to use the room 9 months a year as Virginia winter chilled the room.  The ceramic heater I was using burned out and I saw a write up in Forbes about this heater.  I was skeptical but the room is now warm at 18 degrees outside and 25 mph winds.  
Its quiet and great.  My only issue was for the first 3 hours it smelled of new heat - the smell lighting the furnace for the first time or the first fire in the fireplace.  The smell filled the room to the point of opennng the windows to let air in.  After 3 hours the smell subsided -its been great since

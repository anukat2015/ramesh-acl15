Title: Any suggestions for this problem?
Content:
We enjoy this coffeemaker a lot.  Agree with most of what's said, especially it is hard to pour the last cup which is too bad because it is good to the last drop!
Question -- does anyone have this problem, and especially any suggestions?  Removing the grinding apparatus can sometimes be almost impossible.  The clear top comes right off but the base seems to screw itself into the base.  We can pull REALLY hard and not get it off -- is there a technique besides brute force to release it?
Thanks for any ideas!

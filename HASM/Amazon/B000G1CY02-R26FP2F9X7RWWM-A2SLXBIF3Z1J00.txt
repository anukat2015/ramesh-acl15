Title: Space Heater the Perfect Panel
Content:
I bought this brand and type of 'space heater' based on a Consumer Reports recommendation. It performs even better than I expected.  The room where it is used most is 14x18 (wide open walkway into room)with a large adjoining bathroom.  This heater keeps the entire area very comfortable (overnight temps in the low 30's) for pennies. It has all the safety features I required and is so quiet you don't know it is on. It is very lightweight and extremely easy to move or can be mounted on a wall. I have never used this type of heater, am thrilled it lived up to and exceeded expectations.

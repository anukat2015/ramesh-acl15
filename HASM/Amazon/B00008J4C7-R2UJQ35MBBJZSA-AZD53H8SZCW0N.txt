Title: Great Bagless Vacuum for Wood Floors and Pets!
Content:
My home has wooden floors. I also have 3 dogs and 2 cats. The "dust bunnies" really never cease.
I have tried cleaning with an upright, but debris just gets kicked up by the beater bar and I end up with more mess than when I started.
I tried the Roomba. It was a double-edged sword - no work when it was doing its thing, but the cleanup afterward was arduous. The cup was too small as well and had to be emptied numerous times.
I tried a broom. The dust that sweeping created was at times worse than the mess on the floor. I even tried using a Swiffer duster after the broom. That worked, but going through the entire house twice was time-consuming.
So... I bought the Shark Roadster. Here are my pros and cons:
Pros:
* The dust cup holds all the fur and dirt in the house.
* The head has rollers, making it easy to move along the floor and even across a chair or couch.
*The cord retracts so you don't have to roll it up.
*The vacuum itself is quiet enough I can hear the phone or someone talking to me.
*This little vac keeps so much dust from returning to the air that after a week I'm only now seeing a little accumulation on my piano.
Cons:
*The filter, while working well, is messy to clean. The little brush that's included is nearly ruined and it's only been two weeks.
*The cord is _very_ short (15 feet). My large house means I use an extension cord, so retractable or not, I still have to roll up a cord.
All-in-all, a solid vacuum for my needs. This one's a keeper.

Title: Some good, some bad
Content:
This coffeemaker makes a great pot of coffee & the advance timer function is a real advantage.Waking up to coffee already made is mighty convenient. The functions are relatively easy to program, though the image of machine w/names of parts should have been put on the facing page of the usage instructions.The water gauge has constant air bubbles (very annoying) so amount of water has to be reckoned by the pot. The "finished brewing" alert is so faint that if one isn't directly next to the pot,it can't be heard. Minor annoyances,I grant,but need to be addressed.

Title: Awesome Computer!
Content:
Having spent most of my computer time with PC, I have had far too many gliches and down times with viruses and malware to be optimally productive.  Not having my own personal IT Department to tend to my many computer concerns, this became expensive not to mention a bothersome nuisance.  Since switching to Apple, I've been very impressed with superior customer service I got from the Apple Store!   I am also AMAZED at how user friendly this MacBook Pro laptop is!   The screen is very clear and image-sharp, the icons are readily available at the bottom of the screen, I can customize this desktop many different ways, I LOVE how the keypad lights up in diminished room lighting so that the letters and numbers don't wear off like my old PC and most importantly for me, I especially enjoy not getting PC hassles and computer downtime any more..... I'm converted!

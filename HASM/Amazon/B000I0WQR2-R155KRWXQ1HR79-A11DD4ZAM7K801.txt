Title: Bionaire BH3950-U Micathermic Console Heater
Content:
Its still currently warm here in the Northeast. I did try it as it takes about a hour to get the smell from dissipating throughout the room. After running it an hour the smell went away. Unfortunately the unit did not come with an owners manual and the website did not have a link for this particular unit (surprised), therefore I could not download it. Spoke to customer service and was informed they will email it to me. That was yesterday and I have not as of yet received it.
It seemed to give off alot of heat. Mostly in a upward direction which I like. The thermostat is not really a thermostat per say. You dial it up until it goes on and I guess you back off a little till you are comfortable with the temp. It would be nice if it had a full thermostat.
Its very light so for an older person, it would be an easy task with moving it from room to room.
Overall, I think it will do a good job. I cannot see it being a problem with heating a large single room. As far as customer service, they answer the phone. If they come through or not I not sure.

Title: good upright, awful attachments
Content:
I have a collie mix dog, and two long hair cats, so there's a lot of fur in my house at any given moment.  I really like this vacuum for cleaning the carpets--it really picks up the hair and litter.  But, the attachments are horrible!  The pet hair attachment has poor suction, and constantly clogs.  To clean it you have to take it apart with a screwdriver and then put it back together again and attach it to the vac to see if it's fixed.  The lift off feature is a good idea, but in practice, it doesn't work. It's unstable and falls over because the hose is too short. Also, on my vacuum, the lock on the plastic hose extender doesn't stay locked, so I can usually only reach about two feet ahead.  You get what you pay for with this vac.

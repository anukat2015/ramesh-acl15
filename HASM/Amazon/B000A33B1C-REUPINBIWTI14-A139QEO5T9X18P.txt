Title: Great heater
Content:
Delonghi TRD0715T Safe Heat Oil-Filled Radiator 
A great heater.  We have 3 of these type heaters and this is the best one with a timer on it.  I set it to come on in the morning in our garage and go off when we go to bed.  My husband has a workshop in our garage and we use 2 oil filled heaters.  The third heater is used in my potting shed in the back yard. This one will really crank out the heat, especially on high.  When you put it on high the first few times, you will notice a burning smell, which is the paint being 'burned in', like the engine on a new car.  It has the outside protective shell on it, which keeps it from being hot to the touch.  This is really a nice feature.  Love it.

Title: Know your coffeemaker!
Content:
I was nervous about buying a new coffeemaker, and reading the reviews here actually didn't help that much.  Some people absolutely loved a model, while others hated it - almost an even split.
I've used this coffeemaker for about 2 weeks now.  I've experienced the one problem I'd read repeatedly - the small area to pour the water.  To tell you the truth, it's not that bad - just a bit annoying.  I brew my coffee in the morning, while I'm still half-asleep, and I've yet to spill the water.  If you just take your time and pour from the side, no problems at all.
I think I also recall people saying that it would brew coffee all over their counters.  I think I understand why, though it hasn't happened to me.  The basket which holds the filter and grounds must be snapped firmly in place - pushed down until it clicks.  If it weren't secured properly, the "pause and pour" feature would close a valve and the water/coffee would flow over the top of the filter basket.
  The coffee brewed has been flavorful, it is brewed quickly and quietly.  The coffeemaker beeps when it is done brewing (neat feature I wasn't expecting).  Overall I am very pleased.  
  I've given the coffeemaker 4 of 5 stars solely because the small water fill area.  If this problem didn't exist, I'd have given it 5 stars.  Great coffeemaker, highly recommended.

Title: Truth be told!
Content:
This vacuum may seem awesome the first time but after that it has to be repeatedly unclogged and loses its suction in about a month, glad i waited to review this- the tubes are way too long and it won't even pick up dust- so even now, it is worthless after about 3 months of use and I only vacuum infrequently- so make sure if you buy this to have a wire hangar and the ability to stick tubes back in where it seems like they don't fit - again and again and again! Is there anything out there that actually works and lasts?

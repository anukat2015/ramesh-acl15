Title: Nice first Digital SLR
Content:
This is my first Digital SLR, I've spent the past several weeks learning how to use it. The settings are pretty easy to change, without requiring alot of deep menu navigation. Whats nice about this camera is that the auto setting takes really good pictures, a must for someone that isn't used to all the settings offered in manual modes. Good battery life, support for SDHC cards, a decent all around lens, and a great price make this one of the best DSLR's for a first time buyer.
Cons: The camera kit does not come with a video out cable to hook up to your TV, and the Nikon cable is unavailable everywhere online. Pretty lame for a $600 camera not to include this.

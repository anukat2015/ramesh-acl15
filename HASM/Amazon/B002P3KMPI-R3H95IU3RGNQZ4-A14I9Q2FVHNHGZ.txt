Title: Overall Excellent - Few Drawbacks
Content:
Have had it for 2 months.  Pros: light, great battery life, keeps cool, good feature set.  Cons: trackpad is a challenge, keyboard flexes, and had an issue w/ battery pack and Asus took a month to send a new one and after a lot of effort.  Overall, highly recommend.  To clear one thing up that I see in other reviews - the model at Best Buy is different, namely the track pad and the warranty.  You may pay less but you are not getting the 2 year warranty - I checked with Asus and elected to buy it from Amazon instead.

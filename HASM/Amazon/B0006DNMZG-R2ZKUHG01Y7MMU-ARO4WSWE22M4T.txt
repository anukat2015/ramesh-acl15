Title: Good heater
Content:
This product works quite well for us in MN.  The cord is long enough to position the heater for most rooms.  It produces good heat fairly quickly.  The thermostat which doesn't have numbers seems to be repeatable.
Our only complaint is that the fan is too loud to watch TV without increasing the volume.

Title: Here's a few negatives
Content:
Of course all you know why this is such a hot player.  I give it 3 stars because of the "cool factor" and the ability to store every song I own on such a small device.  But here are some glaring faults:
(1) The battery life is minimal (even playing music).  It runs out after 3 trips to the gym (total usage time about 4 hours).  Then I have to hook it up to my computer to charge it.  I'm playing MP3s at 256K so maybe the songs are eating up processor time.  I'm also planning on creating playlists on my PC so I spend less time with the screen on.
(2) Sound Output.  The earbuds sound bad compared to the headset that came with my $40 CD walkman.  This may just be the difference between the over-the-ear headset vs. earbuds.  Then I plugged it into my high end headset, and the power is too low to drive the headset.  Again, my $40 CD Walkman did fine here.  Dissapointing for a device that should produce CD quality music.
(3) There are about 29 Equalization settings, but no way to simply adjust treble and bass manually.  Maybe this is picky, but why add all those settings but no manual setting?
---> Bottom line, if you aren't picky about high fidelity, and you plan on charging the player every night, then get one!!

Title: Missing Charger and other important items
Content:
I just received this refurbished Archos 402 as of now. The system itself looks like new. However, to my surprise, there are only a USB cable (for transferring files) and a pair of headphones. This Archos 402 "NEEDS" an adapter to charge the unit. It WILL NOT charge via USB cable. In my case, this system is useless without the charger adapter.

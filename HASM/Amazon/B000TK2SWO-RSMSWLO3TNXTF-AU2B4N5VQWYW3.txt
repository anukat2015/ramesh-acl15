Title: Great Heater
Content:
I purchased the G73 after reading several reviews on Amazon and other sites.  My experience with the heater has been absolutely great when it comes to heating.   I have a 720sqft fully insulated and finished garage.  I installed the G73 at ceiling level using a dry power cord at the 230V 30A setting for 5,000BTU.   Outside temperature on installation day was around 20 degrees with my garage temp at 48 degrees.  Less then an hour my garage was 65 degrees with a setting of HI.   After several hours we had the garage around 80 degrees and actually opened a garage door to let cool air in.   If you are considering this heater my suggestion is to buy int immediately.     I did have a problem with the high limit switch turning off my heater after 2 weeks and had it immediately replaced from the vendor.  The 2nd unit works the same and I attribute the 1st unit problem to just component failure.

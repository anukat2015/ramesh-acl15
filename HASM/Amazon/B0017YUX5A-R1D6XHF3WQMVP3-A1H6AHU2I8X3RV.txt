Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
This vacuum is great.  It has amazing suction for the price, and works great on both carpet and wood floors.  One word of caution, when on a Wal-mart rug, turn the suction down when using the beater bar.  I have destroyed two rugs on max suction.  By no means is this the fault of Hoover but merely cheap rugs.  I use this vacuum on my car interiors also.  It has pulled my two boxers' short hairs out of the seats that my $300 shop-vac couldn't get.  This vacuum has cleaned out crevices that I thought were hopeless.
There are a few items of note that you may want to consider:
1.  The beater bar is not height adjustable.  If your carpet is shaggy, don't use the beater bar.
2.  The bare floor attachment is junk.  Go to Sears and buy their bare floor attachment (about $8), you'll get far better performance.
3.  The regular bags are easily torn -- go for the more expensive allergen bags.
4.  The hose seems to be a smaller diameter than that of Sears brands but will fit their attachments.  The hose on the Hoover is easily clogged with items that would normally go through a Kenmore.  I guess the trick is not to use it to pick up items that should be picked up by hand.
I have used Kenmore Whispertones for years, but the Hoover WindTunnel Bagged is the best, especially for the price.

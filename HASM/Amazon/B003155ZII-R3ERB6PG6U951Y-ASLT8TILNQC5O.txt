Title: So good so far
Content:
I've had my new Acer for 3 weeks, and so far so good.  Getting set up on the internet wasn't quite as easy as some of the others mentioned.  I called my internet provider who then referred me to my router company, dlink, who always takes forever to work with.  I eventually got it worked out, though, and I love everything so far.

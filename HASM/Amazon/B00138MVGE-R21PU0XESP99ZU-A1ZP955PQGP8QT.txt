Title: What A Great Camera
Content:
I don't have several hours to do a proper review on this excellent camera, but I can quickly share the high points.  It has great "human factor" engineering, meaning it fits your hands like a glove and all the controls are easy to access.  The camera/lens combo is very light and easy to handle.  If you have any Minolta lenses, they fit.  The ability to view the picture on the large, bright LCD instead of through the viewfinder is a definite plus in many situations.  14+ megapixels ... really, how many more do you need?
Here's the bottom line ... I worked for Kodak, I've been a serious amateur photographer for decades, I've shot thousands of pictures (hundreds so far with this camera) and it leaves nothing that I can think of to be desired.  If you want to spend more bucks on a Nikon or Canon, have fun.  But for my money, this little beauty is a clear winner.

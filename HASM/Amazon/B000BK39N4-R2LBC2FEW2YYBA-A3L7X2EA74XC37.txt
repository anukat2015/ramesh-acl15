Title: Waste of money
Content:
I read the reviews and final choice was between Rebel XT and Evolt.
And made a big mistake of selecting Evolt at the last minute.
After spending $800 at Circuit City, I got the picece of crap home.
It has horrible results inside the house in full auto mode and the AF 
just refuse to focus in home light (which includes halogen)
I took some 100 pics. in more or less all configuration ISO speeds etc
but still photos were way under exposed and every photo had to be edited.
Next morning I tooks it out in bright sunlight - result were good.
Afternoon I took it back to Circuit City and lost $100 as they won't 
refund my full money.
Camera sucks big time for the amount of money one is spending and 
Circuit City customer support added the topping (I can write a whole
article on their support).
Anyways ,,,,, with the bad taste in mouth! Don't think about buying 
this camera.....look somewhere else.
Thanks,
TR.

Title: Dimplex Electric Stove is better than I expected!
Content:
My Dimplex Compact Electric Stove is fantastic. It gives off enough heat to add warmth to the living room and it also fits into the firebox of my faux fireplace built with my home in the early 1930's.  It was well worth the money.  I love the way it looks and I my oil heat doesn't work as much when I have it on.
I love it!

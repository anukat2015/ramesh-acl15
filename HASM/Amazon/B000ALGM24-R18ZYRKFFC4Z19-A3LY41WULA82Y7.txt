Title: Heating control is not accurate. Weekend schedule is not really adjustable.
Content:
Heating control is not accurate. It turns heating off at about +3 degree even though I set accuracy to +/-1.  I guess the problem is the temporature sensor is not very sensitive.  Weekend schedule is not really adjustable. It just drops off two middle schedules of your weekday schedule.  I replaced it with Honeywell RTH230B. RTH230B is in the same price range as Robertsaw 9600 and overcomes the two problems above.

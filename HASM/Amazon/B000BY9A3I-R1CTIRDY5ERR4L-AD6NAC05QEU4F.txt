Title: Quiet and strong
Content:
This is my second Dirt Denil vac and this one is better than the last one.  On/off switch on handle is great, 3 levels.  2 Heads that work great and how cool is the cord retracting into the system.  You can hear the power, but the system is quiet.  Don't forget the retractable shaft for storage.  We love it!

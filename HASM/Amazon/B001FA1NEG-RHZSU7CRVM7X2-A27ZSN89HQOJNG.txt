Title: Will not charge on any existing docking stations!
Content:
I am very annoyed with Apple.  I bought two 4th generation ipod nanos for my kids, and then bought two docking stations with speakers that came with adapters for any ipod.  Turns out that Apple has pulled a "bait and switch" by changing their means of charging without telling anyone, and, as of Christmas 2008, there appears to be no way to charge a 4th gen nano except on the computer.  If I had known this, I would not have bought a 4th gen nano at all -- the whole point was that my kids wouldn't ruin their hearing with earbuds in all the time, and to prevent loss by having the dock. I see this as a huge problem and will be bothering Apple directly with it until they come up with a solution!

Title: Thermal is worth while
Content:
The coffee flavor is very good, if you use good coffee.  I have read of complaints with the aroma button, but I have never used it.  The coffee over flowing, a complaint with other coffee makers, is a matter of learning how to put the basket in properly.  The coffee only stays warm after the initial hour or so, which is my complaint.  Having a thermal caraf is the only way to go in my opinion.  No more acid tasting coffee.

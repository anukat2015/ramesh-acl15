Title: Less plastic, more stainless please...
Content:
April 2010 update - both are doing fine. The first one is a year old, the other one is maybe 18 months old. My coworkers have taken to making coffee with it (their own supplies) and it is working well. 
Original Review Cont'd - We have two of these. One at work and one at home. Both get used several times per week. I wish it had less plastic and more stainless where the water travels. Worry about all the chemicals that MIGHT be getting into my water. 
Bought a first one and it broke within three uses. The next two have been rock solid. 
I really like a one cup maker b/c I seldom drink more than one cup of coffee at a time. I load it up, put my travel cup in and press the "go" button. In about 2 mins I have my hot coffee for the morning. Pretty darn easy.

Title: Packs a punch, for a Rebel.
Content:
I compared this and the Nikon D40.  Glad I got this one.  Easy to use, lightweight, does everything a $1500 camera will do, except shoot fast on continuous.  Great shots, nice and clear, not a ton of distortion on higher ISOs.  The kit lens, although not horrible for landscapes and tight portraits, you'll want something else for low light, and action.  I recommend getting the kit lens for the D40, 28-135 USM IS, very nice and once you put that on, the XTi is a brand new camera.  I've heard of problems with shooting on continuous with flash.  Don't use the flash, I don't even know why they still tack these on SLRs, get a flash if you know you'll need it, you won't regret it.  Another issue is durability, of course they aren't going to make a $600 body as tough as the D40.  I recommend buying the MADE Camera Armor, nice product, helps with the durablility issue.  Right now this is a perfect camera to get me started in my studies and career.  Of course I will upgrade when I start making more money, but this is a cheap substitute and nearly as good as pro cameras.  So if you're looking for a fun little camera that packs a punch and saves your pocket book.  Get this and get the accessories, worth it.

Title: Money Saver
Content:
As this review is title, Money Saver is what this programmable Thermostat is. It has held my programmable setting temps then shut down and startup around a 3 ambient  degree change in the home. Since I installed this unit my power bill have been about 60 to 90 dollars cheaper.  The installation was easy just follow the  wiring diagram in manual. For the price I paid when I bought it from Amazon.Com. No stores in my area could match or beat the price I payed for it on Amazon.Com.  This unit can be set to match anyone living habits at home. It also has a 7 day programmable mode and a vacation mode: that I just tried when our family left for vacation.  It has Indiglo lighting useful at night time. This unit will also monitor the hours use of the filter installed in the home AC/heating unit. What I really like about this product is the Home Today One Touch Override.  If you arrive home and the temp is not to your liking the home today will set the cool temp to your lowest programmable setting in cool and highest programmable setting in heating.  This is a great product by Hunter.   I personally have no complaints.

Title: Great player for great value
Content:
Before I purchased a portable jukebox, I did my reasearch in which was the best. I saw the Nomad and the features impressed me and so did the value. I was going for lots of hard drive for little money and the Nomad clearly beats the ipod in that catergory so I got it. I have been very happy with it and can take my whole music collection in my pocket. I haven't had any problems with it and I'd recomend it over the ipod anyday.

Title: Trust all of the reviews regarding terrible software...
Content:
Believe me, I had an iaudio before but I thought the Sony HD3 was nicer looking, so I purchased it for 300 dollars.  The software was SUCH a hassle, I ended up giving it to my boyfriend and purchasing another iaudio.  In terms of software this was the worst.  I consider myself technologically savvy, but this was the worst.  It took me 3 days (with the computer on day and night) to upload 5,000 songs into the player where in my iaudio it took me less than 10 MINUTES.  And once you transfer all your music it doesn't allow you to transfer the songs to a new computer (I gave away my old - but still relatively new flat screen computer and found out I could not transfer songs from the device to my new one).  Horrible service as well.  Website very inconsistent and software crashes ALL the time.  Don't say you weren't warned.  Not worth it, no matter how sleek the player looks (and it is beautiful to watch and to hold).  There is nothing worse.  For an entire week I couldn't download sonicstage, and I was following all of the directions.  Please, stay away, far far away.  They should really be ashamed of themselves for releasing such horrible software.

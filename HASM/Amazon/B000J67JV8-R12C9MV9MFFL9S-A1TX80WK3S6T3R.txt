Title: Had it for 2 yrs, still very pleased
Content:
I bought this vacuum on 07/29/2007, so exactly two years ago. I love the suction, it's easy to clean and maintain, the attachments work well, the hose is long. However, about a week ago the ON button stopped staying down; I had to press it continuously to keep it on. I was very disappointed because in the two yrs I had this machine I've had no reason to not love it. 
Today I needed to use it again and decided to go online to see if I can find a solution. Some people said that tightening the screws in the handle worked for them. Unfortunately it didn't work for me, so I turned to the product manual which said that the machine comes with a 2 yr warranty. Since I got this machine 2 yrs ago today I thought I'd better call Bissell and see if they can fix this. To my surprise, I got to talk to a rep almost immediately, without the long wait times and the endless loops of automated messages I've come to expect from just about any Customer "Service" Department. The rep told me that this machine actually comes with a 5 yr warranty and that they'll send me a whole new handle assembly for free. 
I am very, very pleased with the machine and the service, it is definitely worth the price. 5 stars from this customer!

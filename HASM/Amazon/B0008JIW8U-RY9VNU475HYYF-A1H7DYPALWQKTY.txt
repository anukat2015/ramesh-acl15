Title: Cute little coffee machine
Content:
After deciding I can no longer afford expensive energy drinks, I put away my coffee snobbery, and went out and grabbed one of these babies. I needed a convenient caffeine delivery source, and so far this has delivered.
I got the black one. It's small, and lives in the corner of my space-impaired apartment kitchen. It's perfect considering I'm the only coffee drinker in the house. If I have a friend over, I can brew up a four-cup pot, which will fill 2 mugs. (NOTE: 1 "cup" on this = 6 oz).
Everything works like it should work. It's easy to program, hasn't leaked, the coffee is standard American fare- put a bit 'o honey and some soy creamer in it and everything's good in the hood. Plus it's $[...] bucks!

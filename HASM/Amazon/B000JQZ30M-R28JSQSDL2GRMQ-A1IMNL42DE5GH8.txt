Title: Lasko Oscillating Heater - EXCELLENT PRODUCT!
Content:
We recently purchased the Lasko oscillating heater for our master bathroom.  The heater heats up quickly and warms the room fast, it is attractive and not an eye sore like some space heaters, it has a timer you can set on it (just in case you forget to turn it off), it also has heat control settings.  Basically, it is good looking, functional and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product.

Title: The Benefit of Doubt
Content:
I'm only giving this review one star for the benefit of doubt that possibly I received a rare player that was doomed from day one.  Within a week of receiving my black 16g Zune, I sent it in for repair to Microsoft. Upon the day I received it back from repair it had given me the same problem as before, which was fading completely black and not being able to use. Which led me to file for a refund and urged me to write this review.  I feel confident enough to say that I recommend that everyone stay away from Microsoft products i.e. Zune, Xbox 360, and Vista. I've heard many instances in which all the previous listed systems are failing recently.

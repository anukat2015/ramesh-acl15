Title: Fantabulous
Content:
So I bought this Laptop in January, at the time it's features were unrivaled by any other vendor. One of the first I7 and 5 series gpu's lay before my eyes. I promptly sold the dualcore asus I bought in October for the same price and picked this one up and I must say it was well worth it. Dump the bloatware and this thing just what seems to be a limitless about of desktop processing power. 
For single threaded apps it overclocks the clock speed to 2.8ghz, for multi-threaded it uses 1.6ghz two threads per core that works wonderfully in windows 7. As for the gpu I regret that I haven't put much on in the way of games, however I saw a notciable improvement in video playback on both it's led screen and my monitor colors just seem more vibrant and the playback is smoother I don't know if this is just because I haven't used an ati card in awhile or no. The only game I have tried was street fighter 4 everything on max with no AA left me with 60fps at the native laptop resolution. 
As for the case and screen the the led screen is alright, the viewing angle isn't so good thought it is still backlit I would say my other screen was better in fact. As for the case all around the keyboard and keypad is rubber.. I don't honestly know how I feel about this yet, as for the plastic it's pretty chaep it's a good thing this thing comes with a accidental warranty because I have dropped it in the bag while reaching down for something and it left a mark. :-(
all in all you can't beat what this thing packages anywhere else. USB 3.0, I7 CPU, ati direct x 10 1gb gpu, 4gb ram upgradable to 8gb, bluetooth, wireless n. What more can you ask for? Other than ati to upgrade their mobile drivers! ^_^ well worth the price.

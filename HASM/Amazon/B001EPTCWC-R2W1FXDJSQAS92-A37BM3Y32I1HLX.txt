Title: Too static sensitive
Content:
I purchased the Zune 8 Gb 2nd Generation in January of 2008.  I loved the product's features, particularly the FM radio with station and song identification.  The Zune software is well designed, and the wireless is OK, however, it's really just an "invisible" USB cable.  You still have to choose songs, etc., using your computer.  
My Zune immediately started rebooting itself, randomly, once or twice per hour.  Web reviews said the problem is common, and is the result of static electricity.  I tried everything ... housing it in protective covers, and so on, but no result.  Microsoft tech support did not help either, and did not admit to any static electricity problems.  
So ... I returned it.   If it had worked, this would have been a 5 star review.

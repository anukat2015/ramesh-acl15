Title: My floors are clean for the first time
Content:
I bought this vacuum yesterday, made hopeful by the pet picture on the cover. I have two long haired black cats who shed continuously, and my beige carpets have been covered by black fur without any hope of relief since I got my cats a year ago. My previous vacuum - your standard, run of the mill thing - did absolutely nothing to alleviate the problem. I was reduced to spending a couple of hours' time on cleaning up my floor with sticky paper, and I felt that it only has maybe a mild cosmetic benefit without true cleaning involved... it was not a pretty picture. 
Bissell revolution is astonishing, given the experience above. I can't recommend it highly enough. My floors are so clean right now. I don't have a large apartment, and in one cleaning, the vacuum picked up all the dirt that must have accumulated over a year. I had to empty the trash canister about 5 times. It was well worth every penny!! Did I mention that it is bagless, too? The convenience can't be overestimated. I still need to figure out how to use a special brush in difficult to reach areas, but rest assured a special brush is available and looks quite useful for cleaning the stairs. The vacuum unit is detachable from the frame, so you can carry it around. There is an indicator for when the filter becomes clogged and needs servicing. 
Anyone with pets should have a vacuum like this.

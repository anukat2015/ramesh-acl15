Title: Great player - easy to use, nice features.
Content:
My husband and I each bought one of these and couldn't be happier.  This is so much easier to use than an ipod - more formats, expandable memory slot, and the video is MUCH easier.  You still need to convert your media but the software is free and easy to download from sandisk.  The radio has very good reception even in my office building.  Most surprising was the recorder.  I was able to record my daughter's high school Christmas concert with amazing clarity.  The added bonus for me was the pretty shade of dark ruby red (not cherry red like the picture).

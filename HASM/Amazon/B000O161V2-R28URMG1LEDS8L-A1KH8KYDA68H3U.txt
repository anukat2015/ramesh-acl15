Title: Great camera even for the photo challenged!
Content:
My wife and I were tired of the point and shoot "shutter lag" and "processor focus delay". We don't want to be great photographers but we would like good pictures. The D40X delivers!!! Turn it on, set it on auto, and shoot. Yes, at some point we might be bold and venture into advance settings. But for now we get great pictures and the shutter works when you press the picture button. I knew when I went looking at a camera that my wife who takes most of the pictures would be turned off by all the dials and buttons. She has other hobby's and although taking pictures of the grandchildren is important, she's not going to want to spend the time to become a photo nymph. I gave her the camera she set it up and good pictures happen. Guess what? I can even take good pictures with this camera. IMHO.

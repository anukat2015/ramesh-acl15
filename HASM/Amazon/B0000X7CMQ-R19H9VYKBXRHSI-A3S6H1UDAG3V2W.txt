Title: Zojirushi EC-BD15
Content:
nicely made coffee maker.  Keeps coffee hot for several hours.  Easy to clean (basket breaks down and comes off the machine).  The lid on the carafe is a bit hard to turn but at least it is easy to clean and not full of little valves like many of the other brands.  The pot is well made and holds heat quite well.

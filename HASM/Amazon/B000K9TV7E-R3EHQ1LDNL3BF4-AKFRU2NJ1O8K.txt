Title: Quality product, however, 30 minute shut-off time is a challenge.
Content:
This coffee pot is awesome!!!  The only grief I have is one mentioned by others....the 30 minute shut-off time is too short.  I highly recommend purchasing the filter that goes with this coffee maker....unless that is, your drainage system is processed through a field bed.  (The coffee grinds stick to the filter but are easily removed under running water...however, those who have a septic system/field bed, all know that we do not want coffee grinds accumulating in the field bed.)

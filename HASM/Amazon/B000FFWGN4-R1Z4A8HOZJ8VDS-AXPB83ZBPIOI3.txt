Title: Gets the job done
Content:
We've had this vacuum for 6 months, with a cat that sheds black hair everywhere, I have long hair, and my husband brings metal shavings home with him in this clothes every day.  None of this is a problem for this vacuum.  The pet hair brush does a wonderful job on the furniture.  The adjustable floor surface height is a great feature.  I love that you can turn the floor brush on and off.  The filters are very easy to clean out, and when we do, the suction is just as good the first day out of the box (we've had to do it twice now).  We use this vacuum every week, and most of our place has carpet, and we do the couch, chair, and bedspread too, so it sees quite a bit of use.  The belts have held up fine - but when I clean the filters, I also clean around the belts to make sure they don't get hung up (there are only two belts, the one for the floor brush, and one for the pet hair brush).  The canister is easy to empty and put back, and cleaning the filters and belts only takes about 20 minutes (not including drying time for the filters - I wash the 2 foam filters out).  It is very messy though - do it outside, or on a tile floor right before you're going to mop.
The only downsides of this vacuum - first, the combo upholstery tool is about the most useless I've ever seen - just use the pet hair brush.  Secondly, the hose does extend, but the vacuum isn't weighted enough at the bottom, so if you try to pull it far from the vacuum, it will tip (both when in or out of the base).  The third thing is that it does run hot, so if you are vacuuming, make sure you're not holding the back of it too near your leg (such as when doing stairs or curtains).
Otherwise, a good vacuum, particularly for the price.

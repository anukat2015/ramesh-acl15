Title: Very Reliable
Content:
I bought this machine 7 years ago and it still works perfectly. I have gotten bored and bought 2 other (not Krups) machines which were terrible, 1 being the Delonghi. Each cup of coffee is great, the cappucino/espresso always a winner.The only thing that is a problem , no water filter.

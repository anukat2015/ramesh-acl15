Title: Hmmm, I think ipod touch is better.
Content:
PROS:
Great large screen.
Plays various file types.
80GB HDD.
CONS:
Battery life is very short! Under normal usage, mine only lasted 3 hours.
Balky and heavy.
Volume is very low.
Video gets choppy during HDD access.
Customer service almost does not exist.
I decided to return and got an ipod touch.

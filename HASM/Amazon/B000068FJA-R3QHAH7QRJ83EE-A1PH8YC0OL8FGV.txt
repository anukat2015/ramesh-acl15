Title: Remote didn't work leaving the heater beeping all the time
Content:
Just barely picked up the unit and the remote didn't work. The remote wouldn't allow me to not only switch the unit to auto, it didn't switch from celsius to fahrenheit either. You might not think that is so bad except the unit beeps once every 2 seconds until the remote is synced up with it. So $50 later I was left with a beeping heater that really doesn't put out that much heat anyway.

Title: I would buy it again~!
Content:
I've had this for about a year now, and no problems at all. Great coffee maker. Insulated carafe and no warming plate (burning plate?) means NO BURNED COFFEE! And there's nothing worse than burned coffee! Sure, you might need to put the last cup in the microwave for a few seconds to get it piping hot again, but that's a  small price for NEVER having a burned cup of coffee. Like the title says, I would buy this one again.

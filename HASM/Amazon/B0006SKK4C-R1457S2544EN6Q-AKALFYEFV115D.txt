Title: Great but not without flaws
Content:
No doubt, the screen is great. But there are a few details that are frustrating. For some reason, when moving from photo to photo, the system will not pre-cache the subsequent photo so that every time an hourglass is displayed for half a second or so until the picture is displayed. This is totally unnecessary and could have been avoided by smarter software. Video will frequently freeze for a moment when played back. Moreover, the system is extremely picky regarding the video formats it accepts. It will accept the AVI files of my Canon SD 400, but will reject the AVI format generated by Windows Movie Maker. It does not play Windows' WMV files which is frustrating.
I still don't regret I got the unit, but more compatibility and smarter software would have been nice.

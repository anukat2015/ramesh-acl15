Title: Yes, finally a vacuum that works, and appears it will last!
Content:
I have been through so many vacuums I've lost count. The last ear piercing noise machine required scrapping the so called bag-less canister before every cleaning so I gave up on bag-less and bought this.  
For half the price of a Miele this machine is quite quiet, has amazing suction, is nice to look at, compact, and has great features; like a long cord.  
This is a great value and it really works!

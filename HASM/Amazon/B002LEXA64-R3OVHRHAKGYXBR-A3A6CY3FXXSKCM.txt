Title: My best purchase in years
Content:
This machine makes a terrific 2nd computer.  The 100% keyboard is great to type on.  The processor can handle streaming from YouTube and Hulu (even to an external monitor).  One of my favorite features is the multi-touch trackpad, which allows me to navigate backwards and forwards in my web browser just by swiping my fingers accross the pad.  The style is very well done, and the size is perfect for my coffee table and for watching movies in a car or airplane.  I would've opted for the better battery if it had been available when I bought mine, but other than that it's a terrific computer.

Title: Quiet Efficency
Content:
I bought this unit to supplement the heating in our second floor master bedroom.  It's a fairly large room with a vaulted ceiling that is located right over the garage. The two air registers on the floor aren't quite adequate enough to keep the room comfortable when the temps outside drop below freezing.
This Lasko unit works perfectly.  It's a surprisingly quiet unit that puts out enough heat to do the job or raising the temps in the room at night enough that I don't get goose bumps while changing into my jammies.  The remote control is handy for turning the unit on/off and setting the temperature (but only in high mode) from bed.  The oscillating feature is well executed; the sweep is perfect at about 80-90 degrees and, again, quiet with no clicking or ratcheting sounds.
The unit is fairly light and is easy to move around.  The molded handle on the back makes relocating it a breeze.  The long cord makes it easy to find a convenient spot for it.  And the design should fit in with most decor.
The only reason I knocked this unit down to 4-stars was because of two things.  First, the automatic temperature feature only works on high.  This is great for large rooms, but using this in a smaller room may only require the low setting to get to the desired temp.  And on that setting, the auto feature doesn't work.  Second, it would be nice to have a no-fan setting, sort of like a radiator.  But that's just me.
Overall, a great little auxiliary room heater with some nice features at a good price.

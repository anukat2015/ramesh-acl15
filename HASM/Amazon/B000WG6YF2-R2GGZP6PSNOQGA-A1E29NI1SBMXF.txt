Title: Great Workout MP3
Content:
Being a solid state memory device, this is perfect for running or biking (not that you're supposed to, but who cares about one ear...)
I have this and use it predominately for listening to music while running or listening to audiobooks while biking to and from work. Amazing product, couldn't ask for more. Oh, I converted from Nano to 30GB Zune, then to this, and now I have a 120GB Gears of War Special Edition Zune. With my girlfriend having one, that totals out at 5 Zunes, and 2 MyVu video glasses. In case you're wondering, I kinda hot tubbed my 30GB so it doesn't work as well anymore, my Nano has been gone for about 4 years, I use my 8GB for running and biking, and my 120 GB for auto and travel (movies with the MyVu video glasses).

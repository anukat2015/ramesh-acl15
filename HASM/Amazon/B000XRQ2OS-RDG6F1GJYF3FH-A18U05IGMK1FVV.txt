Title: Rock solid and easy to use
Content:
I have used the ibiza Rhapsody 30 GB player for the past 9 months.  I prefer using Wi-Fi to quickly download music with the Rhapsody To Go service.  Downloading with Wi-Fi is a far superior experience than connecting the player to a computer.  I can quickly download additional tunes from my sofa at home or at any Wi-Fi hot spot.  In fact, my player has only been attached to the computer once.  Why bother turning on a PC when Wi-Fi is always on?  I have had no problems with this player.  If it were stolen, I would purchase another immediately.  
PROS: 
 - Wi-Fi connectivity for fast music downloads and software updates.
 - Built to work seamlessly with the Rhapsody To Go service.
 - Solid construction (dropped it several times at the gym).
 - 30 GB hard drive.
 - Battery recharges very quickly.
 - FM radio reception is very good.
 - Nice silicon case.
 - Use any battery charger compatible with the Motorola RAZR cell phone. 
 - Easy to search Rhapsody's music servers for songs by artist or title.
 - A subscription for Rhapsody To Go provides access to thousands of tunes both new releases and historically significant material.
CONS:
 - Battery life is not as advertised, but recharges quickly.
 - The equalizer presets are good, but should have adjustable audio bands.
 
CONCLUSION:
The ibiza Rhapsody player is the best player for the mobile Rhapsody music subscriber.  Finally, no fuss music downloads are a reality.

Title: Not Worth the Aggravation
Content:
I would not buy this laptop again. Those who are raving about it are the lucky ones. OK let's start with my list of problems. 60 days after my purchase, my hard drive died. All of my data gone. I had the hard drive replaced and was back in business after being down for a week. This machine never left my bedroom so it wasn't abused in any way. Next the mouse pad left key died. So I had to buy an external mouse. OK, not the end of the world but annoying. Next, the DVD drive stopped working. It would not read DVDs at all. I called support and they said to perform a system restore. Three hours later I was back and running. Three weeks later, the DVD drive died again. Another system restore. I asked them to send me a new drive but they Sony support said it was a software issue and the ONLY way to fix it was a system restore. They also recommended that I go out and buy an external drive. NICE! So as of now I have no DVD drive on this machine unless I want to keep doing a system restore every week or so. Next, the battery died. Without AC connected it lasts 10 minutes. This battery lasted about 3 months and I would occasionally let it drain and charge it which is recommended for long battery life. This is really disappointing. I really expected Sony to step up to the plate but they refused. As an IT professional, I've used a slew of laptops over the years, HP, IBM, COMPAQ, Dell, and this is the absolute worst. You definitely get what you pay for.

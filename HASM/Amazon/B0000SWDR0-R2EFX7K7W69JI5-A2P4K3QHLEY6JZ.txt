Title: Do not buy this vacuum cleaner!
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner last October.  Do not buy this product!  It began falling apart as soon as I started using it.  The crappy plastic clip will not hold the head to the wand and no one has been able to fix it.  It is cheaply made and not really that easy to use.  Buy something else or you'll be spending alot of time going to the repair shop.  Electrolux does not want to deal with it and would not exchange the vacuum cleaner.  Next stop- complaints to consumer agencies.

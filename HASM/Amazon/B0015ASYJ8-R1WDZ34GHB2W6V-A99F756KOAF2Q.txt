Title: My first digital SLR
Content:
I've been using a Point-and-Shoot camera for years now, and I felt that I maxed out its potential.  Sure, landscape photography is nice, but i've always been a wildlife guy & trying to be a wildlife photographer with a point-and-shoot isn't going to get you good results.  It was at this point that I decided I wanted an SLR w/ interchangable lenses.  I chose the Olympus E-420 because it was within my price range and list of features.
I've been learning and using this camera for a few months now, and I am very happy with the results.  Coupled with a telephoto lens, my wildlife photography collection now includes over 60+ bird species in my area.
I would recommend this camera to someone looking to get a SLR camera.  The price is great and Olympus Zuiko lenses are very cost friendly.

Title: GOOD SAFE HEATER
Content:
I'm glad I bought this heater--it does the job. My room is about 10' by 11' with 14' ceilings. I have no heat in my room. If i turn this on high when i get home, my room is nice and toasty in about 30 minutes--pretty good for me! The smell at first is strange, but tolerable (i'd rather be warm with a bad smell than freezing with no smell)and it goes away. In no way is it bad for you. Sometimes is makes small clinking noises but they're fun surprises (usually happens after I turn it off). If you don't use the timer and want to have it on whenever you please, remember to set the timer so it is on at all times (all plastic things towards the center). I thought mine was broken one day, that seemed to fix it. 
Bottom line: great heat, minor cons, all around great purchase.

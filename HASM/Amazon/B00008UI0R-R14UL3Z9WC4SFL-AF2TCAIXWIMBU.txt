Title: Disappointed in this vacuum
Content:
After reading the great reviews, I thought I'd give this vacuum a try.  I am disappointed in this vacuum. The control buttons on the vacuum work only about 50% of the time. I have to unplug the vacuum to turn it off.  I do like that it has great suction and I love the cord rewind.  It has an awkward feel, and it feels like a chore to pull it out and use it.  I will probably get rid of this vacuum and purchase another Eureka "The Boss".

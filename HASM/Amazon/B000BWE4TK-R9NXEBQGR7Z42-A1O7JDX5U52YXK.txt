Title: Love my new Nikon
Content:
I had been using a Nikon N65  film camera for years, Then I decided to go Digital. So my first Digital camera was the Kodak Easy Share, which is a great point and shoot camera, but I wanted something more challenging in Digital photography, so I decided to try the Nikon D50 which I feel in love with it, the moment I was able to take my first photograph with it. I noticed the shutter time was much quicker then with my Kodak camera, Plus I am able to take my Quantrary lens (55-300) from my Nikon N65 film camera and put it on my Nikon D50 and still get great pictures. This camera has been a real eye opening experience for me when I'm taking pictures with it. Plus there is  a book on this particular camera which can be purchased at Barnes and Noble which has been a big help for me. It goes more into explaination for the use of the camera and it also has a glossary of the meanings of the functions of the camera.

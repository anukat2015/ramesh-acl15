Title: Wonderful device !!!!
Content:
This MP3 player is a very god choice if you just want a simple, light and small device. Downloading is very easy and the software included with the package, Musical JukeBox, is really great to manage your files. You can transfer your favorites CDs in MP3 format on your personnal computer within minutes. 
Headphones are not incredibly confortable, but OK. The sound quality is great compared to other players. If your files are from high quality recording, power isn't an issue. I haven't used the FM receiver that much, but you need to be quite close to a good reception to enjoy this feature. When you can, you can record good songs from the air. 
Basic sound options are available, but equalizers are well balanced by default. Managing files with the player's intern software is very simple. It is easy to find a song you are looking for within hundreds of files. 
Finally, if you are looking for additional memory, buy a low priced SD card. I got a 1 Go card for about 65 $. Extern memory is much less expensive than default intern memory, so it's better to buy seperate cards than having a 512 Mo player for a much higher price.

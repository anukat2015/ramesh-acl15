Title: Excellent dSLR
Content:
To start with, the ergonomics of this camera are amazing.  It feels extremely comfortable in my hands.  I would suggest going and handling a few cameras to get an idea of what is comfortable before you buy something, but all of the controls are very intuitive on the D80. 
The image quality is great.  Much of this depends on your lens, but the sensor on this camera does a tremendous job rendering images that you shoot.
The camera is built great.  It is not weatherproofed, so it does have a plastic housing, but unless you are a professional photographer this probably won't matter to you.  I have been using it for a couple years now and it has been very durable.
If you are looking for a solid dSLR, this is a great option if you can find one used.  Otherwise, Nikon has some excellent new options available.

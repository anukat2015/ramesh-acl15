Title: cool stuff
Content:
Fast shipping and arrived just in time to beat the heat.  Nice general appearance. The platinum silver finish is a real upgrade over off-white.  The exhaust kit was put in place in less than 10 mins. Easy and intuitive to use. I use this primarily in the server room where temperatures get up over a hundred. It's a relatively small (220+sqft) I set it on high and had it 18 hours a day for about a week. I walked in one afternoon and I actually felt chilly. Does a great job of cooling. It is fairly loud when on max cool, but doesn't bother me. satisfied++.

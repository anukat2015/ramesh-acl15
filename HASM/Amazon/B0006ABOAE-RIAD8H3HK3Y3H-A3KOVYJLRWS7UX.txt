Title: Mr. Coffee Espresso Machine and Coffeemaker Combo
Content:
On a scale of 1-5 stars, this product should receive zero.
After less than one month's use, parts have started to rust. The steamer arm provides little steam; instead large amounts of condensation collect under the lid which runs down the back of the unit each time the lid is opened.
On the coffee side, the plastic notches on the lid of the pot are flimsy and have already started to bend and tear, making it difficult to reattach.  The lid is an essential part of the coffeemaker, since it starts/stops the coffee flow.
I recommend NOT investing in this coffeemaker.

Title: PERFECT for anyone in the family!!
Content:
I bought this for my 1 yr old daughter who loves music... she doesn't really know how to use it, but she knows that if she presses the button, the music pauses. She absolutely loves it. Not only the music that comes out of it, but the fact that she can chew on it too. I thought this thing was going to break right away with her slobbering all over it, but it hasn't!!!
My husband and I also love it. It's nice to have portable music that you can listen to without earphones. The speaker is loud enough in a closed room, but if you're outdoors it won't be that loud, which is okay since we don't like to disturb others with loud music.

Title: Best single-serve coffee maker out there
Content:
If you're reading this review, you're most likely doing research and trying to decide between the Keurig line (B40,B50,B60), the Tassimo, or the Senseo.  Out of those three, the Keurig is the best looking, the most durable, has the best heating and pumping mechanism, and has the largest variety of coffees and teas available.  The Tassimo's versatility is tempting, but variety of coffees is lacking, the machine is a first-run model that does not feel as quality as the Keurig (I could barely find a piece of metal in the entire thing), and it cannot be set to warm itself up like the Keurig.  The Senseo isn't bad and I may even consider getting it as a second machine, but it is kind of lame how you need two pods to brew an 8 oz cup of coffee.  Considering the price of pods that I was looking at, it would outprice both the Keurig and the Tassimo for daily usage.
Between the Keurig models (B40,B50,B60), I spent a lot of time trying to decide and eventually went with the B60, mainly because the B60 is the only model that brews 3 different sizes of coffee--5.25, 7.25, and 9.25oz.  The B50, a favorite amongst shoppers, does not offer the 9.25oz size.  This large size allows my Oxo travel mug to almost completely fill after using one Extra Bold K-cup.  As an added benefit of the B60, you get beautiful blue LEDs behind the display and the water tank, as well as a polished chrome handle and polished chrome outer-ring to the display.  It looks very modern and very classy in my otherwise boring kitchen.  Highly recommended.

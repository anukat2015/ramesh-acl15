Title: Bunn makes the best coffee
Content:
This is my 2nd Bunn coffee maker.  I always owned cheap ones before getting one of these.  I immediately noticed how much better the coffee tasted.  It is definetly worth the extra money to own a Bunn.  I use it everyday.  I believe that you get what you pay for.  I recommend it highly if you truly enjoy a good cup of coffee.

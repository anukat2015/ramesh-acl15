Title: Fantastic!
Content:
This is my first MP3 player.  It's easy to use and sounds great.  I like the noise cancelling feature.  That's probably what most influenced me to buy this.  I mostly have been using it on the treadmill and when I mow the lawn.  The noise cancelling headphones completely block out the sound of the treadmill.  Very nice.  Also, this is the only music player I've ever been able to hear while mowing the lawn.  While the noise cancelling headphones don't completely block out the sound of the lawn mower, they do cut it out enough so that I can hear the music without having to crank the thing up too loud.
I've got three minor beefs:  I don't like the design of the headphones.  Great functionality, but having the wire that goes to your left ear so much shorter than the wire that goes to your right ear can be irritating.  If I've got the player down in my pocket, sometimes turning my head to the right will cause the plug to be pulled out of my left ear.  Secondly, I agree with an earlier reviewer that it would be nice to be able to delete songs on the player.  If I'm using the thing and decide that there's a song I don't want on there anymore, I need to hold that thought until I'm back at the computer.  And with a thousand or more songs on board, it's easy to forget the sucky one you want to delete.  Finally, and this might not be a problem with the player, I can't seem to get all of the album covers to transfer from the computer to the player.  Many of the tracks just have the Sony logo instead of the album cover corresponding to the track.  Pretty minor issues.  All in all, I would recommend this player to all.  Again, the sound, speed, and ease of use make it well worth it.

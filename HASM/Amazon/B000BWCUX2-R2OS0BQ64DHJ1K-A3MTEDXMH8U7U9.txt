Content:
"Though this vacuum has excellent suction. well thought out attachments, and very easy to push among many other accolades there is one glaring problem. In the user manual it states "handling the cord on this product will expose you to lead,". Well if you have children or your pregnant, well lead is a four letter word. Of corse I found this out after my pregnant wife finished rolling up the cord"

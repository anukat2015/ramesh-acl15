Title: This is a very great mp3 player.
Content:
I am saying this. I hate iPods!!!! In fact, I got one just this past christmas and The damn thing didn't work. I send it back to Apple and Thank goodness I never saw that thing again. I got my money back. then I went to find a mp3 player at Best Buy. I didn't want a iPod because it's like everyone has one and i wanted something that would be able to use Windows media, not downloading iTunes then use the player to put my songs on. I found this mp3 player. I actually was amazed about this player. putting text, songs (of course), pictures, record stuff to the player and put it on the computer. My only small complaints are:
1. the infamous self-starting and freezing thing. I actually keep mine plugged in so even if this does happen, It won't waste battery life. when ever reset it from freezing, it doesn't delete my songs from the player.
2. the ugly USB/AC adapter combination. they are both attached to each other. the USB cable has a extra thing (for the AC adapter) and the AC adapter is useless if it isn't connected with the USB cable thing.
If you are Anti-iPod, get this. just remember what I typed and you should be okay.

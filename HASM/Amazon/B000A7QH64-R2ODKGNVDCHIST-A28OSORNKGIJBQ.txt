Title: Decent while it lasts
Content:
Like many other reviews, I found this vacuum to pick up dirt/hair/small debris quite well in the beginning. But soon the battery gets worse and worse, barely being able to hold a charge. I saw some posters describe a precise cycle for charging/depleting (and even to go against the recommendations in the manual); this does not make a good product. I followed the manual recommendations, and would be happy with a significantly reduced charge over time, but this is just ridiculous. I find it ergonomically satisfactory, easy enough to empty, and overall very sturdy. But without being able to hold a charge, it's not worth it.

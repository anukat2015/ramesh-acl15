Title: great for my aching back
Content:
This is a great vacuum!  I am over 60 with a back problem.  I can use this vacuum without pulling.  It will start/stop with a touch of a toe: no more bending over.  The wand is easy to use for three types of cleaning.  The filter captures the dust.  Suction is powerful and I like the release feature for when little door mats  are caught.  This vacuum is exactly what you need if you have hard floors mixed with throw rugs or areas of carpeting. Clean like MONK.

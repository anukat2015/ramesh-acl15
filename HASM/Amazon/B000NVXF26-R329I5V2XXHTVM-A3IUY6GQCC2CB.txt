Title: Great Camera for a Great Price!
Content:
Found this camera for the lowest price on Amazon.com
It was a wonderful deal since it included two lenses for under $600.  Yes, this camera was discontinued last year, but made a lot of sense to purchase since the newer version does not include any features that make it that much better for me.
The camera arrived sooner than expected and I have not experienced any issues yet - Just enjoying it!

Title: Canon Digital Rebel XTi
Content:
After looking from afar at DSLR's I was finally able to get one. After much research (primarily between the Canon and the Nikon) I decided on this camera. It is easy to use with useful software for the low and mid tech level user. For anyone with a general understanding of computers and menu systems, controls are quite intuitive once you understand the various functions. Though it is pretty user friendly, because you have so many options, you have to keep your wits about you to remember what you have set in various places (that is if you aren't paying attention to the display) until you get used to the camera, but that's just a user issue, not the camera. I have already taken some really nice pictures with it. Instead of a bundle, I purchased a 17-55 EF-s 1:2.8 IS USM lens for it initially and added an EF 70-300 1:4-5.6 IS USM lens when I realized why I had a Vivitar 70-210 Series 1 lens for my old film camera -- Distance.

Title: Perfect Coffee Maker
Content:
After trying several coffee makers, we finally hit on the perfect one.  The Jerdon 4 Cup Coffee Maker with the thermal carafe brews coffee at whatever strength we choose and at a perfect temperature.  All of this with a spout that pours without dripping all over the place.  Previous products that we tried were messy and all did not brew at a good temperature, even very expensive models.  One minor problem that Jerdon should address is the fitting of the lid on the main unit.  Ours is slightly tweaked, but this is a cosmetic concern only.  Functionally, this is the BEST coffee maker we have ever owned, and we have been drinking coffee for more than 50 years!

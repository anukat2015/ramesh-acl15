Title: DANGEROUS- DO NOT USE
Content:
this product burned down my tent in cold weather. It spits propane balls of fire when the tank gets cold, then catches fire. Glad i was awake or i wouldnt be writing this. This Product is god awful dangerous if used for camping.The sunbeam version is what we had. DO not use in an enclosed cold area. I switched to Mr Buddy Heater brand.

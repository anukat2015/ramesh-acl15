Title: Great heater, but footlight has to go
Content:
I love the heater. It's nearly silent, and it feels like a blast of warm sunshine. I was very surprised at the heat output, given that there is no fan. My only complaint is the "footlight". It is always on when the unit is plugged in. You can't turn it off. I ended up removing the bulb, which was easy enough.

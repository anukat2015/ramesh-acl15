Title: BKC700XL is enhanced and quieter!
Content:
This machine is quiet! The only sound heard is the coffee brewing! I have the older "600XL" as well- the 600XL is noisy. This 700XL is a great improvement. This is the Breville model with the "ice coffee" function. Be advised that this function brews a few ounces of hot/ strong coffee. I recommend adding your sugar or sweetner while its still hot- it disolves better. I seem to use less sugar this way. Then pour the hot coffee over ice- be careful that your glass can take the temperature change! Add cream or milk if desired. This makes a wonderful iced coffee! The aroma and flavor are second to none. Depending on the type of coffee you use- it tastes as good as any coffee shop iced coffee. The regular hot coffee brew function is excellent! I give it a "buy it" rating! Enjoy!

Title: Best christmas present this year
Content:
I got the Ipod for christmas, and though i had played with it a little in the apple store a few weeks ago, i was still suprised about little things i didnt notice in the store.  I was pleased about the cover flow, the sound and video quality is amazing quality.  I do recommend buying new headphones as the ones that come with the player are a little uncomfortable and fall out on occasion.
   The only complaints i have is while watching the tv show episode it let me download for free, i noticed it was kind of hard to see when the camera was zoomed out because the screen is so small....but hey, it is an ipod.  The other complaint i have is while playing the really cool vortex game it comes with, because the track wheel is so thin, my finger would get off it without me noticing, but again, i think thats something you would get used to after a while.
So even though i had those two complaints, the first one i think is ok because its perfect to watch a movie or shows say on a flight without taking up your whole tray with your laptop, and the second you will most likely get used to it, so i still gave it 5 stars.  I also had no problem putting music on my ipod, and registering it took a few tries but i assume thats because everyone was trying to register their apple stuff at the same time, and it worked later in the day.
Oh by the way, a movie is approx 1.4gig so unless you fill up your ipod with music, you can always put one movie on there at a time.

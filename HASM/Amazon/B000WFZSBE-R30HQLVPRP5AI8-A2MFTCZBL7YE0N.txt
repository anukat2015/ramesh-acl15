Title: Great Alternative to iPod
Content:
I previously owned a 2nd Generation iPod Nano and msotly liked it, but was sick of the iTunes software and the DRM music Apple offers.
This Zune is the perfect size and has just the right amount of weight to make it feel sturdy, but not a brick. I especially like the metal case. The screen is very bright and to my untrained eye looks nicer than my Nano. The new navigation on the Zune is very intuitive - requires no thought. Audio quality is just as good as an iPod. One huge plus over the iPod is the digital AM/FM radio. It also has wireless capabilities, but I personally don't have much use for that.
The Zune software is OK, not great, but easy enough to use. No problems with installation.
Overall, this is a great product - exactly what should be expected. If you want a high quality music player, take a look at the new Zune.

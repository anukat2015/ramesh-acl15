Title: KEEP YOUR OLD IPOD!
Content:
Don't buy the new ipod!  It does not work with ANY of the old accessories (clock radio, boom box or car adaptor).  The only time I use my ipod is in my car.  The new 5th generation does not work there.  I called Apple customer support.  They were not very concerned because they don't make the accessories.  If we had know before we never would have purchased this new one.

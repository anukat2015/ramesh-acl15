Title: Stay Away
Content:
This is my 2nd review of an Amazon products, so it's not something I normally take the time to do.
Based on all the reviews I read, we decided to go with this canister model though my 20-year old Panasonic is still working with some of the parts broken.  I missed the 360-degree swivel mechanism.  The floor sweep on the Hoover is a sad joke.  It broke after a month while the Panny lasted about 15 years before resorting to good old duct tape.
Overall, I'm not impressed with the quality, functionality, and connectivity (too complicated to get the carpet part connected - over engineering?).
BTW, even consumer report had good ratings on the Hoover, but I'm not sure if it's the same Windtunnel Bagless version.

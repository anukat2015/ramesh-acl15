Title: Stylish and very uesable
Content:
I had been considering buying a new Macbook to replace my ageing iBook G4, which at 3 years old is getting ready to be retired. My ventures into the electronics shops to play with the Macbook brought me into contact with netbooks... and was I amazed at their price!
Although I was an Apple convert of 5 years these tiny gems seemed to be able to do everything I wanted with a mobile computer (remember I still have a functioning iBook... and a new iMac). I wanted something that was very portable and light. I wanted to be able to surf the net, read emails and type the occasional document. And I figured I could live with Windows XP at a push, so I started my research. I read all the reviews. I flipped through every PC Mag I could find. And I tested them in-store.
The HP Mini 1000 got my attention for three things 
a) The stylishly compact design and high quality build
b) The almost full size keyboard
c) The amazing screen with glowing colours
Now to be honest I must admit that it looks a lot like the black MacBook (which has been discontinued) and as a Mac user I do like design. But the keyboard is so easy to type on compared with the other ones on the market. And the case is very very stylish and professional looking (unlike some of the other netbooks out there). And the edge to edge glass covered screen makes it look even more impressive. The build is solid and it is sturdy enough to throw into a backpack.
I also appreciate the lack of extra pre-installed trial software as well so I don't have to spend hours removing it.
Oh, but I forgot to mention the price! It's about 1/3 the price of a Macbook! Not bad in these bleak times.

Title: Really cute, too bad it doesn't work well
Content:
I bought this vacuum to clean a small (about 700 sq. ft.) house I rent. It's an adorable vacuum which is good because there's not a lot of storage so it kind of sits out there, and it's definitely not an eyesore. Unfortunately, it just doesn't clean so well. The vacuum power is reasonable if not vigorous, but the handle is too short -- you need to bend over to use it, even my 5' 4" girlfriend is bent over halfway using the thing. I guess it's good that you're down there because the hose detaches constantly and you need to put it back together. Be careful that you don't use the vacuum enough to fill up the bag! We went all over town -- in a major urban area, no less -- to finally find bags that fit the thing. Unfortunately, I absolutely would not buy this again. Only gets two stars because it appears to actually generate a vacuum consistently and without trouble.

Title: Great Product......Love Apple
Content:
This was my first transition to a Mac from using windows based PC for most of my life.  This is a super user friendly computer that has tons of hardware and software to do whatever you like.  Though I am just getting to know the in's and out's of the macbook world, I can already tell that I will be an Apple fan for life.  The new Leopard OS X is by far the best OS that I have used.  Queit, portable and is just sleek looking.  What else can I say......I love this MACBOOK PRO

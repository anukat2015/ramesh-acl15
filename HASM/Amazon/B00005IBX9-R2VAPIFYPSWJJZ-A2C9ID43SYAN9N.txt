Title: Looks good, works well!
Content:
I purchased this Cuisanart Coffeemaker to replace a Mr. Coffee which had started leaking. The Cuisinart looks good, I wanted something in stainless steel to match the kitchen appliances. So far it brews well (I use it at least twice a day) and there have been no major problems. My only concerns are that it uses the cone shaped paper filters which cost more and are harder to find. Also the lid when lifted usually drips water along the back of the coffeemaker. Other than that, I am very happy with it.

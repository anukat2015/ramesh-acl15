Title: Optimus H-5210
Content:
This heater works very well.  It seems very efficient for the wattage it consumes. 
It adjusts between 400 and 800 watts by always turning on one or both elements.  I am concerned that the one that is always on (bottom, I believe) is going to wear out before the overall unit does.  
I was surprised to find that the heater does not have a thermostat, it is either on or off.  However I paired it with a WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat, and the combination is much more precise and controllable than any built-in thermostat would be.

Title: Heet iz gud.
Content:
Small but mighty.  Not the most advanced feature set, but when you're really stinkin' cold, ya just don't actually care about that, you care that it makes heat well and fast.  I'm thankful for the speed with which it warms up the room, it has saved me from complete & utter discomfort during times the building boiler has had issues.  This little electric gizmo is a perfect supplement for drafty days at home, perfect for toe-warming under the desk at the office (sh, don't tell the building cuz they don't allow), or a great savior for the nights when technical difficulties make it your only heat source.  Durable, too: it was a hand-me-down, I guesstimate it's pushing 5 years old now, and still operates great.

Title: CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT NEW 5 GEN IPOD NANO
Content:
5th generation ipod nano!  I have never had an ipod of my own before.  Since I have used my daughter's ipod many times, I am familiar with how the ipod works.  ITunes is such a convenient way to organize my music that I decided that I wanted an ipod of my own.  I really enjoyed choosing which model of ipod I would buy.  The new 5th generation ipod nano was just coming on the market, and I kew it was the one I wanted.  The variety of colors were a bonus.  (I chose the blue.)  The extra features (FM radio, video camera and pedometer) are useful and fully functional.  I haven't tried the digital recording feature yet.  The only thing I don't like about it is the touch wheel controls.  I am starting to get a feel for it, but the sensitivity is hard to judge.  Apple hasn't improved that part of the ipod.  It is basically the same control as in the ipod I bought for my daughter five or six years ago.  Even with the touchy controls, I am still completely satisfied with my new 5th generation ipod.  Right now I have about 600 songs downloaded on it.

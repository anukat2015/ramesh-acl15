Title: Best Toshiba I've owned!
Content:
I just looked at the reviews for this laptop and was surprised when I didn't see a solid 5 stars. I've owned about 20 different Toshiba laptops since 1996 and without a doubt the 1805-S274 is the best I've owned at ANY price! It came with everything I needed (except XP Pro) and hasn't frozen once in 6 months of extensive use! The reason I've had so many different machines is that I'd use them for a while...they would get a little &quot;buggy&quot; and I'd give them to a new employee. I'm hanging on to this one because it's perfect. No Complaints at all!

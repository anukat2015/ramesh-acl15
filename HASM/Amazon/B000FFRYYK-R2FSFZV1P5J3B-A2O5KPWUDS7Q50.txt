Title: Great, Fast Coffee without the Volcano
Content:
This is without a doubt the best coffeemaker that I've ever owned.  It has been about 3 months now, and I could not be more pleased.  
The very premise of a Bunn coffee brewer is different from the "volcano" models that erupt with loud roars and groans as they slowly belch hot water and steam over the grounds one teaspoon at a time.  With Bunn, you get perfectly brewed coffee in a few minutes after a half-hour initial, one-time set-up. 
One thing to remember is to keep the carafe - and especially the black plastic parts - CLEAN.  When I failed to do this, the carafe tended to dribble coffee down the front of the carafe.  However, a weekly cleaning of the carafe mitigates this design issue. You can clean by placing on the top rack of the dishwasher or with a little dishwashing liquid.  Another post indicated that the carafe was redesigned (improved) in Feb of 2007, but I have no independent knowledge of that. 
You must also use BUNN filters, as I found out when using a store brand once, which caused a mess. Live and learn.  
Great tasting coffee is the result of near-boiling water being run over grounds in a systematic, controlled way.  Bunn does this, and FAST!  Would highly recommend.
** UPDATE **  It is now Feb of 2010, and the unit still works perfectly.  All you need to do is clean the black parts with DAWN dishwashing liquid weekly to avoid dripping.  Emphasis - use the real DAWN liquid for this purpose!!

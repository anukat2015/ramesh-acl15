Title: Works for me
Content:
I bought the Soleus Air HGW-308 model in September 2005 and have used it every winter since. I did not buy it to heat a whole room, but to heat my immediate area, such as in the sun room when I'm watching t.v. For more than one person in the sun room, I would use the room heat pump. However, for the comfort of one person, it works just fine. I like its total quiet operation and have not had a problem with the thermostat. I agree that it would not be able to heat an entire large room, such as a sun room or garage. For the purpose that I had in mind when I bought this heater, it does the job. For additional comfort in my sun room, I added a portable Hunter humidifierHunter 34352 Care Free Humidifierplus 3-1/2-Gallon Humidifier, with Exclusive NiteGlo Night Light. This, plus the Soleus, makes the room area comfortable in the winter.

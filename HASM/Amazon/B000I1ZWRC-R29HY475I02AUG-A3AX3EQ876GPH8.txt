Title: Excelent Choice
Content:
I spent quite good time triyng to decide what camera do I want to have. Then I bought this one.... just a excelent camera. Now that I own it, I realize that it is too much for my needs but It is a next forward step. I am completely satisfied with this camera... It is excelent. Plus, the software that comes with the package is very, very helful. 
Be careful.... this package do not include a memory, you have to buy it separately, and do it at the same time you buy the camera. Also I recommend to buy the memory reader for your PC, you will need it, trust me.
Excelent camera....

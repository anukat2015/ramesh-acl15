Title: Ineffective on Carpets!
Content:
The Shark Roadster's sleek design and is lightweight and easy to carry around with it's included carrying strap; however, the three main tools are not as easy to manage.  Three large, seperate, cleaning tools are given; however, there is no where to store them.  We have wood floors, oriental carpets, and an upholstered sofa.  I am constantly having to switch between the three tools, lugging them around the house with the Shark on my shoulder.  In addition, the Shark works great on our wood floors, utilizing it's strong suction power; however, don't even bother trying it on carpets.  The bristle brush for carpets gets stuck and is just horrbile (leaves them just as bad as when I started).  Defniitely look elsehwere if you have carpets to clean.

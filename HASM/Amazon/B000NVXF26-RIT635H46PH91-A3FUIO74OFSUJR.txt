Title: The best choice for the price
Content:
I switched from film SLR to digital and E-510 was my choice. I'm using it for 6 months and so far I don't regret it. The 14-42 kit lens had front focusing issues but Olympus repair service fixed it. The other kit lens (40-150) performs excellent.
I'd like to see better dynamic range, but this is more film vs. digital issue than E-510 itself. I noticed increased noise at ISO400 and more. This is problem with most 4/3 cameras caused by smaller sensor size.
I use it mostly in full manual mode, as this is the way I used my old film SLR camera.
I upgraded to Zuiko 14-54 and 70-300, and with this combination I couldn't ask for more.
In conclusion, E-510 is not perfect at all, but probably the best choice for the price.

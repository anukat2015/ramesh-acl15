Title: Love it!
Content:
I absolutely love this laptop. I've only had it for 2 weeks and when I got it at office depot they had to go out to the truck and get it. They only had 2 and luckily at that exact time only 2 of us were wanting one.  I'd rather it didn't have all the trial programs, but most computers do so it's not a big issue, you can take them off.  My battery lasted about 3 hrs and that was playing a game that takes up alot of resources and still searching out stuff on the web. We watched movies on it while my daughter was in the hospital and it works great.

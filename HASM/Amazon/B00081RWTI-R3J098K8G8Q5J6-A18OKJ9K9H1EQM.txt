Title: Disappointing performance
Content:
I expected better from Cuisinart, one of my favorite brands.  The performance of this coffeemaker is really poor, but this is not surprising based on the features and design flaws.  I did not keep it long enough to experience some of the problems others have mentioned, and that was because the coffee produced by this maker is totally unacceptable, and that of course is the biggest complaint.  I suppose if the coffee were simply incredible, one could deal with the cleanup inconvenience.  This is an expensive unit and one expects some level of sophistication.  This unit does not allow for a choice of brew temperatures nor does it allow the user to choose grind fineness.
The grinder shares a compartment with the water reservoir, so each time a pot of coffee is brewed, the user must rinse off and then dry the grinder unit!  The size of the grinder is inadequate, resulting in coffee that cannot be flavorful enough due to the fact that enough beans cannot be used!  My elderly Mellita Mill & Brew makes a far better cup of coffee and was less than half the price.  It doesn't have the high tech look but hey, I'm in it for the taste.

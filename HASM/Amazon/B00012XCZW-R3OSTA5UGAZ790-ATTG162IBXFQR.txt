Title: best
Content:
My husband wanted a Bunn coffee maker for years, but I wouldn't get one - I was not fond of the style.  I broke down over a year ago, and decided to get this model.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This is truly the best residential coffee maker, at least the best I've ever tried.
The coffee is ready in just three minutes and you can brew a second pot immediately, due to the reservoir.  Somehow the way this brews the coffee makes even the cheapest swill palatable.

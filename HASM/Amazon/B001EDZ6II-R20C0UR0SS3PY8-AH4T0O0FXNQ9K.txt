Title: Do NOT expect a whirlwind...
Content:
This heater *seems* well made. (I say that because the last Lasco heater I purchased a little over 18 Months ago just gave out and it had seemed well made as well) .  Be that as it may, this heater is not loud, and the circulation fan as a result, is not great.  Many Vornado fans I have purchased in the past really move air.  This one does not.  IF you are expecting this heater so really kick up the heat, do not expect great things.  If you have a small room that requires extra heat this one will do.  I would suggest the Pelonis ceramic heaters as well.  Pelonis are definitely louder.
My final take is that it is pretty expensive for the money.

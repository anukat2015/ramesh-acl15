Title: Best Camera Ever
Content:
Really enjoying using this camera -- it was easy to set up and start shooting -- love the lack of shutter lag! Gorgeous shots, resolution. Getting used to using the viewfinder again -- it's really better and beats using a monitor in bright sun!  Got the big lens also but now I need one for wide angle.  The main complaint I have is that the specs never made it clear the type of memory card required, and now I have to try and deal with making a return to Amazon (never a fun experience).  Also it didn't say that a battery charger was included, so I had to return the one I bought at Best Buy.  Other than that, I'm completely happy.

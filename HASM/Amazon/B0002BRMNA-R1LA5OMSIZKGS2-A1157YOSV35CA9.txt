Title: Unfulfilled Early Promise
Content:
As an audiophile, I just this last year succumbed to the allure of being able to take most of my music with me and bought first an Archos Gmini (battery life of about 1 hour) and then the Zen Xtra. What I like about this unit: using WMA files ripped at 192kbps, the sound is often quite good, especially with a decent set of 'phones (Sony MDR-EX71). The size of the unit, while larger than the iPod, is perfectly acceptable. I even like the stying. And the price is right. With so much storage, I can carry most of my CD colletion with me. What I don't like: EAX "ambience" settings are a pure gimmick, sound pretty bad, and reduce the volume too much.  The buttons are flimsy.  The software is an abomination. And if you want to actually try the world of purchased digital music, it's probably best to stay with iPod.  I used MusicMatch, and have been unable to get the files onto my device after it recently crashed. Which brings me to the Achilles' heel of this unit: poor reliability.  My first unit died within a month after about a 6" tumble to the floor. My second unit crashed, too, for no apparent reason and I had to reformat the hardrive.  Now the FF and rewind buttons won't work. My unit is no longer covered by the ridiculous 3-month warranty, and customer service is a sad joke.
Being able to take so much music with you is great. But if this is what you have to put up with, it's not worth it.

Title: It's a 'Clean Sweep'
Content:
Great Buy! Well worth the money.  I vacuumed my carpets with my other vacuum, then went over the same area with the Electrolux.  I can't believe the cleaning power.  The Electrolux actually picked up more than the other vacuum.  Filtering system is Great, as well as being bagless.  I highly recommend this product.

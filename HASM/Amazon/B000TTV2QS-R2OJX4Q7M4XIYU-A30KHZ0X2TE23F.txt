Title: Really awesome heater!
Content:
I bought one of these last year to put in my bedroom because I live on a three-floor townhome and the termostat is on the second floor. My bedroom is very large and the little heater did a great job warming it up. So I decided to get a couple more heaters, one for the guest bedroom and one for my basement office. They did such a great job and made my energy bill so much lower that I brought the guest room heater to the living room and turned off the central heat.
This year, I went to a store and saw them at a lower price, so I went ahead and bought another one to put back in the guest bedroom. They are really great because not only do they have remote controls, but they also have an auto setting, so you can program the temperature you want and just leave it on. Programming is as easy as pushing a button to set it higher or another one to set it lower, and the heater thermostat makes sure the room stays at about the temperature you set. This product is so good that two of my friends went ahead and bought some for their houses after they came over and I told them about how happy I am with them!
Here are my thoughts on this product:
PROS
- light and easy to carry around if you want to move it from one room to another
- durable, the ones I bought a year ago work as great as they did when I bought them
- convenient and easy to use remote control
- easy to use digital control on the unit
- automatic temperature setting
- heats up the space quickly, even larger rooms
- does not use much electricity
- nice design, easy on the eyes
- cheap and small enough that you can get one for each room of your place
- for multi-floored homes, if working with central heaters it will help level the heat throughout the place
CONS
- after thinking a lot, I realized that the only con is that you have to be careful where you store the remote control during the summer. I had put the ones that are in rooms where there are drawers in the drawers, but can't remember where I put the remote for the unit in my living room. So, if you purchase this during the cold months, come up with a system for storing the remotes at a place you will remember by the time it gets cold again next year.
UPDATE: When the temperature gets really low outside (teens through low 20th's) I do turn on my central heater to help with the larger area of my place (living and dining rooms that are open together). So, if you live in a colder region and have larger areas with big windows or sliding doors, one of these heaters may not be enough to keep such areas toasty. Although, if it is a larger area that has heavy curtains helping insulate it, etc, then it may be all you need (ie: my bedroom is 15 x 12 and this little heater handles all that is needed to keep the room warm, and the finished part of my basement that has only a window--not a large glass sliding door like the living room-- can also be kept really nice and warm with just one of these heaters running in it). 
Enjoy your warm home!

Title: High Electric Bills
Content:
I have the EdenPure Gen3 Model 1000.  It was recommended to me by a contractor doing work on my home (he meant well).  What a waste of money.  My electric bills are now consistently 250.00 a month.  Might as well sell it, and buy a cheaper heater which will do the same job as the EdenPure.  My electric bills sure can't get any worse!

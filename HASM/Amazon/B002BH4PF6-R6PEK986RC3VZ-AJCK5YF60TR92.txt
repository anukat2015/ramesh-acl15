Title: key color not as shown
Content:
Just recieved the DV7 - 1450us and read all the reviews about similar products with this new bronze color and the problem some are having seeing the keys. This seemed to be on models with bronze keys/ white letters. This model shows bronze keys with black letters and thats what I wanted. Guess what color letters I have ????? Not Black. Bad Start already. I dont see a major problem, but the black would be much clearer against the shiny bronze keys.

Title: Works Great
Content:
After several weeks of use I have no complaints. In fact, I plan to purchase another unit for my basement. It probably won't heat the whole basement, but it should take the chill off. I have not received a recent electric bill so; I'm not sure how much the one unit added to my heating costs.

Great Coffe maker!  Looks good on the counter, right up to the part where the water comenced leaking from the bottom.  Uncontolable water.  I called the company, they referred me to a company in Pensylvania.  It would have cost me more to send the machine and fix than replace.  I called back to the company. I was instructed to cut the cord send to the company.  They sent me a new one.  But with out the foamy milk maker. Down grade.
 Less than three months later.  This one leaks as well.  Good luck people.

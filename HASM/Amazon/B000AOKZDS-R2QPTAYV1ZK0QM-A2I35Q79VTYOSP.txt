Title: Don't waste your money on this machine...
Content:
We thought we had bought the ideal coffee maker. What a surprise we got when after 4 months, the coffee reservoir began to leak. Coffee all over the counter with every batch of coffee we made. I did a search on the web and found more complaints of a similar nature with Hamilton Beach only offering the opportunity to purchase a new reservoir, even for systems that are still under warranty. Also, freshly brewed coffee was not brewing hot as it had when it was new. For the money paid, it wasn't worth keeping, so we moved on to the Cuisinart DCC-2000. Do yourselves a favor and stay clear of the Brewstation Deluxe. Buy something better.

Title: Best MP3 Player I've Found 99.9% Awesome
Content:
This is a great buy for your money!  Not only do you get an easy to use and classic looking MP3 player but headphones,USB Cable, Lanyard, and a protective case are also included.  Loading music, pictures, and videos is super easy just click and drag.  The screen clarity is wonderful and I would compare it with HiDef picture. In addition you can record voice as well as songs on the radio FM tuner!  Pair all that with the fact that you can add up to 2GB additional memory and you have the perfect package.  The only thing I can say that kept my rating from being 100% is the fact that in music mode there is no Stop.  You can play and pause which i guess is plenty but stop would have made my smile a little bigger.  Other than that this is a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone of any age!  Also, don't forget there are all kinds of cool accessories that go with it from silicone, leather, canvas and industrial rubber protective cases to Car transmitters and portable speaker docks.  Get yours NOW!

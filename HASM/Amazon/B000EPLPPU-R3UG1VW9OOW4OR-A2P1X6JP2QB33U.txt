Title: Easy Listening
Content:
I bought this Apple iPod Shuffle so I could listen to music while working in my garden. I love the little shuffle. I just clip it to my shirt and go. I did have to replace the earphones with ones that have smaller ear inserts. (I just have small inner ears). I was able to store 326 mp3 songs on mine. That's about 17 hours worth of music ... plenty enough for me.

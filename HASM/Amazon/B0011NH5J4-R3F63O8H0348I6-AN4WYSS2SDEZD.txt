Title: Beware
Content:
I am very disappointed.  I spent $1699 before tax and software for this computer.  I have had the computer less than 2 years and the screen started flashing (see K Krieg's review).  I took it into Sony for repair.  They told me the NVIDIA (which is fused to the motherboard so it means a new motherboard) was defective and wrote that on the repair slip. They also said that there is only a one year warantee so I am out of luck.  I would be very disappointed if I bought a Sony TV for $500 and it broke within 2 years. They have had some problems and issues with the video card in the past. I don't think that K Krieg and I are the only ones that have experienced this problem (or will experience it). I can't believe they want more money from me.  How long should a computer like this last.  Who is responsible if the parts are defective?

Title: Great, but with serious flaws
Content:
I've liked Olympus point and shoot cameras as well their film SLRs so I couldn't wait to get the E-510. It's a delight. The ample control fit my hands well and are in the right places. The menuing system is great. I thought that thanks to my less than great old eyes I'd use the LCD for composing most of the time. I was wrong. The viewfinder is simply wonderful and I use it 95% of the time. I love the ability to reuse my many old XD cards as well as the CompactFlash (BTW: get an Extreme IV CF - you won't believe the speed). Overall, I'm delighted. So what's not so great. Well, the build quality. I had the camera out on a Florida evening that was quite humid. The next morning the LCD was full of what looked like water droplets and the shutter was dead. This camera wasn't ever near a source of water, just very humid air. It needs to go back and Olympus suggests from leaving here to getting it back will 3 to 4 weeks. This camera isn't 4 weeks old. Plus to get that speed I get to pay FedExs or UPS both ways. So even if they do the repair under warranty I'm out $50 to $100. That doesn't make me a happy consumer. BTW, if you get an E-410 or E-510 get the two lens kit. It's a huge bargain.

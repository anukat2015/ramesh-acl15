Title: Great idea, too bad it didn't work
Content:
I was enthusiastic about supporting green technology and saving money on electricity this winter, but unfortunately the eco-heater really needs to go back to the drawing board for some serious improvement. It is just simply low-grade. The heat it puts out would hardly keep you warm if you were standing right next to it. My bedroom is very small, and the eco-heater just did not warm it significantly at all. Too bad, because it seemed like such a great idea. I went instead with a Delongi 'dragon' oil radiator. It has two eco-settings (600, and 800 watts along with 1500), is silent and has a really easy-to-program timer that makes the heat come on for the specific intervals you choose, which saves on electricity.

Title: Go with a window unit
Content:
If you plan on using a Soleus, be careful. The unit will leak water all over your floor in addition to requiring constant emptying which is a huge pain due to the fact the valve is less the .5 inches off the ground. Soleus considers a normal 90 degree day in Chicago to be "extreme circumstances". I guess most of you want an air conditioner for those cool dry days.

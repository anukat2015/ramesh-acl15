Title: ELEGANT CLASSIC IPOD
Content:
Well all I can tell you is that I"m a baby boomer, and that this is my first Ipod (Ipod Classic 160 gig)...and I am thrilled with the ease , Of setting  it up.........I know if your not a kid, it seems that this would be a difficult thing to do. But its jut the opposite, Once you download the itunes store to your computer( which is easy, its almost automatic) and plug in your Ipod it almost does everything automaticly..just answer a few prompts..and your ready.....you can put your cd's on it , as well as purchase music or enjoy thousands of free podcasts.......such  as old time radio.etc........etc.......this truly is a wonderful thing........and with 160 gigs of space,excellent battery life , I doubt you can ever fill this thing up, My first computer did not have that much space!!.........I highly reccomend it!!!

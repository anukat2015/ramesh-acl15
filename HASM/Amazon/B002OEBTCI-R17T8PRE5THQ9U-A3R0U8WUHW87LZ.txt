Title: EXCELLLENT Camera
Content:
I really did my homework on this one.  The K-x is my first dSLR and I am very pleased with it. I have taken almost 600 pictures in about every possible condition.  I am still on the first set of batteries.  It really shows off in low light conditions.  The two kit lenses are very good.  I have had zero problems. Make sure to download the updated firmware available online.  
Major pluses for me include: a) Image stabilization is in the camera body.  When I add more lenses, I don't have to buy lenses with built-in stabilization.  b) The low-light capability as mentioned earlier. NO other camera in this class performs as well, according to many reviews. [...].  
The increase in picture quality over my point and shoot is literally like night and day.

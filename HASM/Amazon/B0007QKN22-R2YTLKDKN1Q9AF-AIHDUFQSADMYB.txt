Title: This is a great product.  The battery life is astounding.
Content:
If you are on the fence about this product (like I was), then you should not hesitate any longer.  In the description, it definitely underestimates the battery life.  I bought this camera about  month and a half ago.  The battery took an hour to charge.  I have taken at least 1000 pictures with it.  Flashes, long exposures, you name it.  Just today, the battery life indicator showed one third full.  I plugged it in, and a half an hour later, it was fully charged.
Also, it takes great all around pictures.  The image quality is very good.  The 18-55 lens works fine for me.  I don't think I would need another lens anytime soon.  It is good for zoom, close ups, etc.  I might want a macro lens soon, but other than that, there is really no need to get more lenses.  I would recommend a remote (for bulb exposures, etc.), and a UV filter.  Also, a tripod is a necessity.  The xti is no better, so don't waste your money when all it does is use up battery faster.  
Anyway, this is worth the money, and Amazon is the place to buy it from.  Buy it.  You'll be glad you did.

Title: Ended a long search for a  netbook
Content:
I've been searching long and hard for a mid/high end netbook, but wasn't impressed with any of them. Basically they all have the same specs. $350-$400 price tag. Slow Intel Atom Processor. 10" low resolution screen. 1GB of RAM with no expansion slot, Windows XP. 160GB HD. Etc. When I saw the specs on the new Acer 1410, I thought it sounded to good to be true, so I took a trip into NYC to see it for myself at JandR. They also have just about every other current netbook on display. After trying every netbook they had, the choice was so easy. The 1410 was in a league of it's own in the $350-$450 price range. It has an Intel Centrino Core Solo Processor which is much faster than the Atom. 11.6" high resolution screen. 2GB RAM with 1 open slot. Windows Vista Home Premium with a free upgrade from ACER to Windows 7 Home Premium when it's released. 250GB HD. 6 Cell battery that doesn't bulge out the back like on most others. All of this in a 3 lb package. My 1410 is performing better than expected, and I'm getting used to the small touchpad. I recommend that anyone looking for a netbook go check out the 1410 for themselves. It is well worth the extra few dollars for what you're getting. I easily give it 5 stars.

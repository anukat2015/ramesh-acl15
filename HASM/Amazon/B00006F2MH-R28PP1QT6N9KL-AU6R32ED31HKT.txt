Title: Great cup of coffee!
Content:
I purchased this coffee pot after a lot of consideration.  I was very concerned about the comments regarding cleaning the grinding bay.  You do have to clean it after every use but it can be rinsed and put in the dishwasher or just rinsed and dried.  However, the effort it takes to clean the unit does not compare to the great coffee that you get.  It makes hands down the best coffee I have ever had from a standard coffee pot!

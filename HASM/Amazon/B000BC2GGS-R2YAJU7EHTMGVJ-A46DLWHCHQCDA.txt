Title: Nice "baseboard" type heater
Content:
I bought this heater because of its high rating in Consumer Reports, and its reasonable price, and have not been disappointed. I'm using it as supplemental heat in a vacation home garage. I've had the heater about a month and use it every weekend.
PROS: 
- Clear digital display allows setting to a specific temperature
- Can also be set for "length of time on" (but not programmable)
- Has a number of safety features, eg: tip-over sensor, overtemp sensor
CONS:
- A little clumsy to pick up. No obvious hand holds or handles
- Top grill never feels hot (you wonder if its working), but heats OK
- Low profile means it's easy (in a garage) to drop things on it

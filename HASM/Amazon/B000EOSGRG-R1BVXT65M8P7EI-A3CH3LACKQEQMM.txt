Title: is it supposed to make this noise?
Content:
I bought this vacuum with a singular function in mind.  I wanted to clean up my son's cheerio mess without a broom.  since dry cheerios are light, anything should pick them up.  This vacuum performed perfect for the first day.  After that, it started making a slight noise when in use.  Then picking it up and using it caused a loud noise.  Then finally, I figured out the problem.  The vacuum rotor popped off the motor spindle.  It fell apart after less than 2 days.  While it may work great for the first day, I can't recommend a product which only lasts two days of light use.  Very poor quality control.

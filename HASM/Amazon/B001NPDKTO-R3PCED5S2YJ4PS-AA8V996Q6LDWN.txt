Title: It is nice but don't like the reflective screen.
Content:
I had an IBM Thinkpad for several years and moved up to this HP.  It is fast, nice and has everything you could want but the shiny highly reflective screen is not a good thing.  
You have a terrible time seeing anything if you are outside using this HP. If you are inside and near windows or lots of lighting the screen is often difficult to view.
The reflection is very disturbing and wondering if there is anything you can do to minimize or elimanate the glare of the screen,  I wish it had the non glare screen that my IBM Thinkpad had,  it was much nicer and easier to view.

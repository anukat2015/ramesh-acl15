Title: Worst Coffee Maker
Content:
I was given this coffee maker as a gift land thought it was great until I had to clean it. But the worst part of the product is it won't last much more than a couple years.  First one refused to work after 2 years.  Being STUPID I bought a second one because I like fresh ground coffee. This one was a different design than the first but they haven't improved the cleaning process or the technology because here it is two years later and it quit grinding again and I am looking for another coffee pot and I guarantee it will not be another Cuisinart!!!!!

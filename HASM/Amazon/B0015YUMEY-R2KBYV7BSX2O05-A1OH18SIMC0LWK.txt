Title: Can't help but love a Mac
Content:
I love the large screen. It makes trading stocks much easier as I can watch up to 6 charts at once all while buying and selling stocks.  What's so great is that I can not only do this at home, but as long as someone else is driving I can keep trading while running errands around town or on trips.  The larger screen is GREAT.  The only down side is that the computer still gets hot.  Not as hot as the older models, but still bothersome at times.  As an investment it has paid for itself already with the profits I've made.

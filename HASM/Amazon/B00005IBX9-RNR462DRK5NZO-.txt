Title: Dealing with the Cuisinart Company is a Horrible Experience
Content:
We bought our Cuisinart Coffeemaker at Christmas and really like it.  Our power went off during the hurricane and when it came back on the coffeemaker didn't work.  I called Cuisinart and was given a service notification # and was told to send the coffeemaker back w/ a check for $10.00 for shipping/handling and as soon as they received it a new coffeemker would be sent.  I sent it UPS ground and they received it the following day.  I called them 8 days later &amp; &quot;Lisa&quot; said they hadn't looked at my coffeemaker yet (why do they have to look at the broken coffeemaker before sending a new one??) but would send me a new one that day (and it would take 5-10 days to get here).  I called 7 days later &amp; never got to speak to anyone - I was on hold w/ Customer Service for 15 mins., then 19 mins., then 27 mins. and the phone would click off.  I called first thing this morning (8 days after being told one would be here in 5-10 days) and &quot;Julie&quot; told me the shipment of new coffemakers just came in and they would send me one out today!!!!! And that it would take 5-10 days.  I told &quot;Julie&quot; when I spoke to &quot;Lisa&quot; on 10/2 she was going to send me a new coffemaker that day - didn't she know they were out of stock?  And it doesn't take 5-10 days for UPS ground shipment from Jersey to Maryland. It's been a truly frustrating experience and am spreading the word how the people in Customer Service at Cuisinart ARE ABSOLUTELY USELESS!!!

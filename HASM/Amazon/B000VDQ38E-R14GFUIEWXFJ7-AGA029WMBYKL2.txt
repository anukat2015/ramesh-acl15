Title: Pleased with performance
Content:
So far, so good.  We have very light colored flooring (carpet and hardwood).  You would not even know a black cat and Rottweiler live here.  This vaccum has great suction even on the barefloor setting.  I would not only purchase it again but I would recommend it to anyone, whether they have pets or not.  The only reason I did not give it all five stars is I agree if you let the canister get even a little too full it can be slightly messy to empty.  However, that was my fault for not paying attention.

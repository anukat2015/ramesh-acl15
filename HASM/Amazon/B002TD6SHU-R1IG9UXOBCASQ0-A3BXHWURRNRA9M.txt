Title: Something Good from Europe
Content:
I was pleasantly surprised by my Miele vacuum.  I thought it was made in France so I imagined it would have two reverse gears for retreating and a little white flag, but in fact it was manufactured in Germany.  As a result I went through my living room faster than you can say "invade Poland".
I've owned various Eurekas and Kenmores and in contrast this is a very light and quiet vacuum with great suction.  It even looks sharp!  Sure, it's not perfect: the included floor attachment is not motorized so it's "sticky" on carpet and the electric cord is a bit too short.  And of course it's pricey - the attachments can cost an arm & leg (for example the motorized carpet cleaner is $150). 
Still, it's an all around a great product and I highly recommend it.
The included carpet/floor head is relatively small so presumably it's meant for mingy little European apartments, but it seems to be capable of doing larger houses.  The small size is actually nice for getting into corners or under furniture.  It might be an issue if you have a 7,000' mcMansion - but then you're probably not doing your own vacuuming anyway.
In summary, it's amazing that German union workers can crank out something like this between their vacations and strikes, but I suppose most of the American brands are so bad that we're not offering much competition.  Those of you who view Europeans as the debauched dregs of once-great empires: you might be right - but they sure make a nice vacuum cleaner.

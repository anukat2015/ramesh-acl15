Title: Good potenial
Content:
Just got this the other day to take care of the fur from my two Maine Coon cats.  
The instructions were not very helpful and the screws had to be found inside the box as they became detached and floated away during shipping. Have someone who is unfamiliar with your product try and assemble your vacuum, part of marketing.
The two stage bag-less feature is not so good.  When you empty the lower container all the dust, hair and derby from above falls back down.  This was not an issue of over filling as I emptied it often. It was due to the cyclone like design that sucked the stuff up and into the top.
The dust and dander (from the HEPA filter?) escaped and collected on the outside of the waste containers near the HEPA filter.  I would wonder how much of it was just ejected into the air?
The "Turbo" brush was great, until I used it on the stairs.  I was unable to complete half the stairs before the hair from the cats got entangled inside the drive wheel.  To correct this you have to have a long handled screw driver to dis assemble the handle and pull out the hair.  It was caught everywhere inside the device.  
The hair brush on the front of the vacuum cleaner was useless and only kept me from getting close to the wall and made nice brush marks on the carpet when I was done.
There is a leak in the hose if it is bend to far, which occurs because the plastic handle has an unnatural curve.
The soft bristles were the best and dies really pick up the cat hair.

Title: Good Vac
Content:
Not a bad vac.  
  Pros - Quieter, Small, Lite, Good suction, Controls on the handle make it easy to use, Easy to disconnect power head with no hands.
  Cons - Small dirt canister, Tube connecting wand to vac doesn't swivel at the connection points - you have to rotate the whole wand to untwist the tube,  No swivel where wand connects to the power head - you can't twist your hand and have the power head twist on the floor to get vac around corners etc.   
  Good for the price - I'm glad I bought it.

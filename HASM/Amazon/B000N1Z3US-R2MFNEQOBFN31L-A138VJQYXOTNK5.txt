Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
I had a TCM450B for over a year and it makes great consistent coffee.  
Recently my girlfriend dropped a heavy metal knife into the carafe and broke the internal glass.
This is the only coffee maker I have ever owned that compelled me to buy a replacement of the same type. I ordered another TCM450B and I'm back to making great coffee. Unless you are a complete klutz, I find nothing extraordinary difficult about this coffee maker.  The thermal carafe in PLAINLY marked on where to rotate the lid to when pouring a cup of coffee, which it does without any spills.  Other glass carafes I have had did not pour as easily as this one.  The plastic is the same as any other coffee maker I have used in the past.  The thermal carafe keeps the coffee warm for hours.  I have no complaints at all about this coffeemaker.
I can say with confidence, I would buy this coffee maker again because I did!

Title: Just what we needed
Content:
This one-cup coffemaker was actually purchased for my son-in-law who is serving in Afghanistan.While speaking with him,I asked him if he needed anything and he said a pot that makes exactly one cup of hot water-for hot chocolate,cup-a-noodles and so on.I ordered this product because it was exactly a cup measurement. I recieved it and shipped it off in its original pkg.. He recieved it and says it was just what he needed.Thanks!

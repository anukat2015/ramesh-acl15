Title: Drink coffee all day?  Look no farther.
Content:
I wanted something rugged for my office, I want coffee hot but not burned, and I need more than 8-10 cups.  This is it.  Well made, sturdy stainless carafe, and it stays hot all day even if only half full.  I wonder if the reviewer who complained of lukewarm coffee had a defective unit?  Mine starts hot at 8 AM and if there is any coffee left at 6 PM it is still drinkable.  This will be my next home coffee maker too.

Title: a Sony TV remote will turn the Vornado's thermostat down, by FIVE degrees!
Content:
I just bought this remote control Vornado heater (TVH 500, TouchStone 500 Vortex Heat) and discovered that when I used my Sony TV's remote control to turn the TV's volume down, I heard a beep on the Vornado heater.
I double-checked, and every time I hit the Sony's "volume down" button, the temperature on the Vornado's thermostat went down -- by FIVE degrees!
I couldn't do anything, other than return the machine.
No one with a Sony TV will be able to use this heater, at least not easily.  I suppose someone could use the Vornado's remote to turn the heater up 5 clicks for every 1 click they turn their TV down, but that seems like an unreasonable amount of work.
12/21/06. A small clarification: The Sony remote doesn't actually turn the heater down by FIVE degrees.  Rather, the heater's thermostat will continue to go lower and lower for as long as you hold the "Volume Down" button.
A quick tap turned the thermostat down five degrees.  Holding for as long as one second causes the thermostat to go to its lowest setting, 65 degrees.
12/30/06: I'm very surprised to see that this review got a "1 out of 5" helpfulness score.  I emailed Vornado and they told me themselves that they had created a device that was on the same frequency as a Sony remote.
That has got to be the lamest mistake you can make while creating a remote-controlled device!
When I returned mine to Bed, Bath & Beyond, I told them they should give the warning to anyone who buys this -- "Hey, you don't have a Sony TV in the room, do you?"  I didn't get the sense that the store was going to be giving any such warnings to future customers.

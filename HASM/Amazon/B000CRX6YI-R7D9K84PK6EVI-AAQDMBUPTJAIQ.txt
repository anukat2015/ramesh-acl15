Title: What a camera!
Content:
Just back from a vacation where I took the D200 and a little Flip video unit.  The D200 performed perfectly; the 18-200mm lens is the perfect lens, wide to zoom, and sharp as a tack.   It was especially easy to change ISO settings on the fly; the camera just feels and acts like a "real" camera. The only issue---it's a little heavy.  I bought a better neck strap for it--the little one bites  into your neck after a while.

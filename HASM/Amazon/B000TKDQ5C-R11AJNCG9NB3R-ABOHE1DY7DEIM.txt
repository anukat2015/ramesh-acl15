Title: Big things come in small packages. An excellent buy!
Content:
I live in a condo that has in-wall Cadet heaters. We had to disconnect one of them since there is a bookshelf in front of it. This halved our heating capacity, so when the temperature was down into the teens this winter, and the morning temperature in the living room was 60 degrees, it would take hours to get the room back up to 68 or so. We also have a little-used room where we turn off the heat. This little heater makes the room usable again.
I bought this heater to fill in the heating gap we created and it does the job quite well. It's small enough to sit on my glass-top coffee table. It kicks out quite a bit of heat on high, but not enough to take off your arm hair if you get too close. When the package arrived, I thought another Amazon order had been delivered since I expected a much larger box. Nope! This heater is about the size of a gallon milk jug. It has a thermostat but I don't really use it since I just turn it off when it's warm enough. The outer casing stays cool to the touch so I don't have to worry about the dog sniffing it and burning his nose (because he's dumb enough to do so). My only concern is that it doesn't have a tip-over switch. It's not a huge deal since I don't have any kids, but it's something you kind of expect in a modern space heater. Money well spent.

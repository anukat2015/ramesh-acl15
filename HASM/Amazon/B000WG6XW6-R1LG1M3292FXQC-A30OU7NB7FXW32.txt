Title: Get over it!
Content:
First let me say, I have no problem with my Zune, I had an 30 Gb version and upgraded to 80 Gb I have song that wern't bought from the marketplace and they all play.  I have absolutely no problems with the software, the first version did suck because you had to resync completely if you wanted to add like one song.  Also if you wanted to remove one song you had to go through a song and dance.  With the upgrade you can access your Zune like a HDD, just click on device and search thru the songs until you find the one you want to cull, them BAM! its gone.  As far as using it for storage of documents... WHO CARES!  You bought an MP3 player not a portable HDD!  If you want a back up of important docs spend 10 bucks and get a 256 stick and keep it around the house.  I read a review that said the screen was small and blurry, this thing has one of the largest screen on the market!  I admit that some of the other players have some cool features but the Zune is not as bad as people make it seem.  As far as playback onto your PC, why would you get a portable MP3 player, sync it with your pc, then delete the songs off and just play it thru the player?  You can just unplug the speakers and plug them into the headphone jack and there your go problem solved.

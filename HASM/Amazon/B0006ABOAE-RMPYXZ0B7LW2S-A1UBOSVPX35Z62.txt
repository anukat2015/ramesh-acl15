Title: The smartest purchase, and greatest value!
Content:
I love my Mr. Coffee coffee and espresso maker. I was daunted by some of the negative reveiws it received, but I went ahead and purchased it anyway, because it was the only one I could afford. What a great machine! It does everything just like it's supposed to; it was so easy, I didn't even have to read the directions. The only thing I couldn't figure out at first was how the milk frother worked. I did not realize, (stupid me!) that of course you have to add MORE WATER THAN YOU NEED for the espresso, so that the EXTRA can be used for steam. Duh!!
I do not have a problem with coffee spilling everywhere, because I raise the lid with my thumb when I pour. And I think that the coffee is hot enough. Of course, I don't like my coffee scalding hot, either.
All in all, if I had it all to do over again, I would have done it sooner, and not spent so much time wondering and worrying about it. It truly is a remarkable machine for the price.

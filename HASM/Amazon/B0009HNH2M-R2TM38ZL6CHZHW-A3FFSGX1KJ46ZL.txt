Title: solid built, powerful and user-friendly.
Content:
my wife had been looking around, for a good while at different styles and types of vacuums.  she has tried the bagless styles and was very displeased with them.  after many considerations (oreck, kirby and etc.), she chose to try this one.  after using it for several weeks, she has stated that she was very glad that we bought his one.  i, myself, was totally surprized at the quality of this hoover.  it's very well built (not flimsy like most other vacuums at this price), very easy to move around, and has very strong suction power.  my wife likes the way that the wands fit together easily, without the cord being in the way (the cord that dangles from most vacuums with the power nozzles) and the fact that you don't have to change one nozzle to another (rug to bare floor) to finish vacuuming, just push the bar from rug to floor and it's done.  the only thing that my wife didn't care for was that two of the attachements tools are stored on the wand, which does at times, come off when bumped against something.  But other then that, she is very happy with this vacuumm.  we have many pets (six all together) that are inside which my wife has to vacuum at least four to five times a week (with all the shedding) and she feels that this vacuum will do the job for a long time (we average about a vacuum every 2 years due to the constant  use).  over all, with it's sturdy built, power, and user-friendly abilities, we give this vacuum  5 stars!!!!!michael and penny smith

Title: almost great
Content:
The ipod is great...love all the features.  It does more than I realized, but the earphones lasted all of three weeks!  The left one blew out quickly and I'm a 40ish year old who doesn't play it nearly as loud as younger users are sometimes known to do.   Several other aquaintences have confirmed the same problem with theirs.  I will say...the sound was GREAT while it lasted.

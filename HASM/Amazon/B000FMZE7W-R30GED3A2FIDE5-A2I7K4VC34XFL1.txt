Title: Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)
Content:
LOVE IT!!!  Its not an IPOD (thank god) but its getting better with each passing firmware update....  I bought mine back in 2007 and have gone thru multiple firmware updates and my unit works like the first time I turned it on....  The Zune Social is also another aspect of the device that I like, it allows users to come together and discuss the device and other things of interest....  Overall 10 out of 10, I have not had any issues so far....

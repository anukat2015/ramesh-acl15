Title: Sequel to "Capturing Baby Moments"
Content:
J Summer....congratulations on your purchase of the Canon XSi DSLR, it's a great camera!  Since this appears to be your first DSLR, let me offer you one tip on improving focus on your baby's face. Do NOT use "autofocus" (which is really nine point focus) for your portraits, or any other images for that matter.  Instead set the MODE dial to the creative zone (NOT THE BASIC ZONE), using "P" will work well for you until you gain additional skills and confidence.  Then press the focus button (see page 61 of your User's Manual) and move the MAIN dial until the only focus point selected is the center one.  Next compose your shot by centering your baby's face in the center of the viewfinder, press the shutter half way, recompose if you want a different view (rule of thirds helps with composition) and shoot!  Presto...your baby's face is now in sharp focus with all images!  And when you're finally feeling that you've mastered the "P" setting, move on to learn shutter, aperature, and manual modes in the creative zone.  Now you're a savvy photographer!  Good luck!     
One correction: The focus button I reference above (shown on page 61 in the User's Manual) is actually called the "AF point selection" button.  Sorry for the error!

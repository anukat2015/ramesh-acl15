Title: good deal.
Content:
I paid 130 bucks a piece for two of these for my wife and I and I'm really happy with them. We've had them for only a month and they do everything they are supposed to. They did however freeze up a few times when we first used them and we had to poke the reset button on the side, but nothing was lost an it hasn't happend since the first week. I am very happy with my player especially because i use it for audio books. It plays the copy protected DRM format that my library uses for online rentals and has a really good bookmark feature. I spent alot of time researching players and for my money this was perfect.

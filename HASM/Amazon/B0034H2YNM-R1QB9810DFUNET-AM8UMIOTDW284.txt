Title: Great notebook in 800$ range
Content:
This notebook is a great product. Battery life is very good, and ability to switch between integrated and discrete NVIDIA graphics for excellent video experience is a winner. Heat management is also outstanding. 
Only thing I don't like that much is touchpad, but I can live with that. All in all, don't hesitate to buy this product, you'll be very pleased.

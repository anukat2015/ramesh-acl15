Title: Change your settings
Content:
Let me start by saying that I consider 4 stars to be outstanding.  I will reserve 5 stars for products that are incredible.
Now, I've only had this camera for a short time, so I will not be providing a detailed review just yet.  I only want to address the "issues" with this camera's image quality.
The DEFAULT SETTINGS on this camera body produce a somewhat soft image.  You can go into the Picture Style Settings and increase the sharpness to whatever strikes your fancy.  The sharpness of the Standard Picture style is set to 3 out of 7.  Crank this up a couple of notches and fire away.  Instant sharpness.  You can change any of the settings of the Picture Styles this way.  Very easy.
Please get an idea of what you've got and what you can do with it before giving such a good camera a bad review.
Of course, this does not apply to duds.  It happens and the company will take good care of you if you get one.  Buy with confidence.

Title: CROOKED!!
Content:
So my boyfriend bought me this laptop three months ago. It had been working just fine and then a few weeks ago it got to where it wouldnt charge. I called customer service and they asked some questions and they said it sounded like the actual jack was messed up. So they mailed me a prepaid box and said they would take care of it. It came with a one year warranty and we bought an extra four years. 
So I get a message sayin I have to pay [...] bucks for them to fix it.THATS ALMOST A BRAND NEW ONE! We call and they say that the motherboard is also messed up. Ummm I dont think so! They say my warranty wont pay for it. The tech was supposed to call us and when he finally did he said he found other things wrong with it...like the mouse thing. What??? 
Then they accuse me of breaking it on purpose and stuff. Who in their right mind would do that? They said they even called and got a "confirmation" that thats what happened? HELLLLOOO? WHAT? Who would they call? LOL....
So they are mailing it back to me....Best Buy said they would fix it for free. I should have just went there to begin with than dealing with crooks like SONY!

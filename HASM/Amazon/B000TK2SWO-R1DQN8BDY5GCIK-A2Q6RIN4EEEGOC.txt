Title: Dayton G73 Electric Garage Heater
Content:
I am very pleased with the performance of Dayton G73 electric heater for my insulated, 480 square foot, ten foot ceiling, attached garage.  Even on sub-zero mornings, it has kept the garage in the 50 degree (F.) range, on the "low" temperature setting on the thermostat.  On the "high" setting, I've had the inside garage temperature into the 78 degree (F.) range, after an hour's operation, with sub-freezing temperature ranges outside.  The only disappointment I had with the purchase was the fact it didn't come with a "pig-tail" (wiring cable).  It worked out okay because that way, I was able to match the cable to the receptacle for the final wiring.  I don't know how much it has increased my power bill because on "normal" (usual winter days/nights), I don't even turn the unit on, except for days/nights when outside temps are below zero, or I'm actually working on projects in the garage. The hardest portion of the job was the actual running the required 10-2 wire from the circuit panel to the location of the 240V outlet.  I had a master electrician review my installation (and purchase of materials) of the dual-post, 30amp circuit breaker and wiring, via a digital photo of the 70 amp circuit breaker box for the garage.

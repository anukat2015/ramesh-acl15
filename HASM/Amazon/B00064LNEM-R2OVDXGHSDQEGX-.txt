Title: Great looking
Content:
This is a great loking coffee maker, especially in a stainless appliancce kitchen. It works good and makes good coffee but after about 9 months of regular use it quit working. Now we were not "cleaning" it each month with the vinagar sitting then brewing several times. My husband was able to take it apart and clean heating coils and it is working again now. It is not made clear enough, in my opinion, use must clean this coffee maker monthly using their recommeded method.

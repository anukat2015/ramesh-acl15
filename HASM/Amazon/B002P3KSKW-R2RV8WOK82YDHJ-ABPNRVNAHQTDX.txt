Title: Great Laptop for the Money
Content:
I have been using this laptop for over a month and have been very impressed.  I wanted the optical drive and the 14 inch model was the smallest model that still offered it.  The laptop is very thin and light and is about the same size as the comparable Mac Book Pro.  I debated on whether or not to make the jump to a Mac but decided to give Windows 7 a try because all of my existing software is Windows based.  So far, Windows 7 has been a pleasant upgrade.  I loved XP and it took roughly 5 minutes to learn how to navigate the new OS and it runs smoothly.  The battery life is incredible and I have no trouble making it through the work day.  I am also a grad student who carries this everywhere and it has exceeded all expectations.  For the money you get a thin, light laptop that runs cool and quiet all day.

Title: too bad
Content:
it doesnt have ablueray as it requeires for it's properties, not that fast as it says for it's properties, and even crash somehow:S!!!
and the quality of the laptop parts are really easily broken i warn yu, dont look at the price and the parts they never get well with each other like a sony or a toshiba, 
and also it says that its a game machine but it doesnt even go well with a football manager 2010!!!! so i must say buy a toshiba or sony like i do now!!!!

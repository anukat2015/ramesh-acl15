This product, which I think is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned, has been returned.  It had some good reviews here - did these folks EVER use the product?Each session of use requires you to do about a 20 minute cleaning session, since the steam makes a grimy, sludgy mess in the grinder, and throughout the interal parts of the unit.Grounds slip past the included filter, and into the pot.  Its really tall, so it was hard to even get the coffee and water into the machine for my 5' tall wife.  The top wouldn't open while unit was under the cupboards on the counter - it opens UP and so must me moved everytime you want to do anything with it.Shame on Cuisinart for allowing a product this poor to make it through testing.Amazing that such a good compnay could makes such a lousy product.

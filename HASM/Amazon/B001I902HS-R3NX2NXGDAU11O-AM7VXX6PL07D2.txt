Title: Mostly pleased
Content:
What is good about it:
~Great suction--picked up much better than my old vacuum
~Variable height control adjusts well to different carpets
~Quiet
~Very easy to assemble and to switch attachments
~I like the on/off switch on the handle
~Lightweight--easy to carry & use
~Headlight
~Retractable LONG cord
~(FYI: hose is 6'--some sites claim it is 8')
~Body seems sturdy
~Bags easy to change
What I don't like about it:
~The metal tubes that connect the head to the hose are not adjustable, so one height fits all.  I am 5'8" so a bit longer would be nice.  But it's not terribly short--I just wish it adjusted.
~The head has rubber around it and the body has rubber in the front only--I wish the body had a rubber bumper all the way around.  
~The plastic of the head & handle does seem a bit flimsy--but it may just be that it is a lighter weight plastic that what I am used to so that it feels flimsy but it actually is sturdy.  Certainly the lighter weight is nice when vacuuming.
~The carpet height adjuster is a plastic lever you operate with your foot on the head.  I fear it may break off it not used carefully.  
~The brush attachment is quite small with short bristles.  Again, not terrible, but a bit larger with longer bristles would have been better. The good news is the attachment from my old vac fit this one, so I'm going to keep them.  (If you haven't thrown your old vacuum out already, save the attachments!)

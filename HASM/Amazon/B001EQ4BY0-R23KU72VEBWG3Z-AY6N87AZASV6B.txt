I have never owned a prosumer camera in my life.  I bought a 30d for a friend as a gift and shot with it a couple of times.  The results I get with the 50d far outshine that of the 30d but I can't tell you why.  Not an expert.  I just know you can't beat the price and the 28-135mm lens produces wonderful shots.  I like pulling it all the way out, setting the camera on AV mode at 5.6 and getting that beautiful blurry background with my subject in focus.  I have two friends with the 30d and they have both found my camera extremely desirable.  One attractive quality is that you can see all of the settings when you look in the view finder so you can make adjustments while you are framing up a shot.  I can't wait to really learn the camera.  The user's manual is okay but I preferred getting the field guide.

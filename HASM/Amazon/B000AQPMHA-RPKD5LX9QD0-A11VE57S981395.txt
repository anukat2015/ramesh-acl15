Title: Just What the Office Needed!
Content:
This is just what my office needed.  I have been struggling to find a cafe convenient to my office where I could get a quick cup of java, since the shared pot on my floor is a bit too grimy for me.  Of the FIVE cafes in my building, the coffee is too weak.  So I investigated getting a single-serve machine.  I figured that I could amortize the cost of the machine in 2-3 months.  Upon the recommendations of the other reviewers I gave the Keurig a try.  WOW sums it up.  So very easy to use.  Basically plug and go (actually you run water through the machine once to prime it).  I use the Green Mountain French Roast Decaf.  It's not Starbucks, but then again it is convenient and will only cost FIFTY cents a cup.  I use bottled water, so no need to run into the pantry.  Also, clean up is a breeze - just take out the little pod and toss!!  This could not be more perfect for my needs.

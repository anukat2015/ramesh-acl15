Title: didn't hold up
Content:
I bought the 8 cup about 6 months ago. The coffe was good and I'll not go back to drip. The problem was I dropped it and didn't realize the plastic cracked. I kept rinsing it out after each use( I never submerged it)and about a week later it quit. I took it  apart and found water had gotten into it. I dryed and cleaned it, fixed the crack, but it still won't heat up. I can't send it in for warranty because I dropped it. I thought it should have held up better for $50.00.I will buy a different brand.

Title: Not Good
Content:
Very poorly designed. The pieces inside where the basket for the coffee goes do not fit together easily or well. Tricky, not ergonomic, cheaply made.
Lid to pot is not removable, making cleaning less easy. Doesn't pour very easily. 
My unit decided to stop keeping correct time after one week so the programming feature is now useless to me.
Not a good coffee maker for the price, especially since it's only a 10 cup.
Don't buy this unit, it's cheap, but it shows.

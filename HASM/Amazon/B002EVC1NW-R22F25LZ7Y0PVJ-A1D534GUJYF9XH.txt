Title: Great personal heater
Content:
I bought this heater for my receptionist.  Our office has poor climate control. She is freezing where she is sitting and keeps her coat on.  What she does is jack up the temperature control in the office, which can make part of the office sweltering hot.  It's an old large office building, and the temperature control is very poor. After the office heats up, we are unable to cool the office down and end up opening the windows and doors to try to cool off. At times the office was at 80 degrees and the temperature controls do not work to cool the office.  I wanted a heater that would keep her warm and not heat up the rest of the office.  She is now much more comfortable with using this little heater and no longer plays with the office temperature controls.  I have kept track of the office temperature and even when this heater is in use, the temperature of the office does not increase. So the rest of the office remains a more comfortable temperature for most of us (around 70 degrees).  This is the perfect heater for someone's own personal space and it is very quiet.

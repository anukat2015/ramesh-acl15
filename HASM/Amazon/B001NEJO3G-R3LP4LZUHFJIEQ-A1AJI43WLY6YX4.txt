Title: Toshiba does it right!
Content:
If you are looking for a widescreen laptop, this Satellite has everything you want and doesn't give you things you don't want for the money. I had an HP and I won't ever go back. I love the fact that you get the (64 bit) version of Vista, that is the only way to get the true benefits of 4gb of ram with Vista. The eSATA/USB port is the only way to go if you are planing on using an external storage device, it is many times faster than using USB alone. They put just the right amount of software on the computer without all the bloatware the comes preinstalled with other computers (HP). This laptop has a great look and finish, I especially love the feel of the keyboard and when you type it is very quite. I forgot how much I missed the 10 keypad, I won't go without one again. The finish does seem to be a little suseptible to scratches. The Harman/Kardon speakers sound great, you can turn the sound all the way up without any static. The FM tuner works great and it is nice to listen to the radio while on the laptop. So far, the battery life is very impressive for such a large screen laptop. The more I use this Satellite, the more I love it.

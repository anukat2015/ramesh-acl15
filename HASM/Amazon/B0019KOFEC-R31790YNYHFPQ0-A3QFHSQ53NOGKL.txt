Title: Pet Hair Lover!
Content:
I love this small, lightweight vacuum.  I bought it to vacuum the rug in our boat and it works great!  I also have a lot of carpeted stairs and it really has good suction.  I also like the fact that I can walk around with it and get to low places and high places without changing anything.

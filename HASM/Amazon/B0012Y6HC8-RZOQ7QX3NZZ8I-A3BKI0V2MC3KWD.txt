Title: No expert, but a great SLR camera for a noob
Content:
My first SLR camera and I really like the feel and the large LCD screen on the back.  I find it is very user friendly.  Has a lot of automatic features so you don't have to be a expert to take some good quality photos.  You can grow with the camera as you learn more of it's basic features.  I picked up a couple of lens to go with this camera and can't wait to explore more of what it has to offer. I'm so glad I choose this model.  I've been wanting to get a SLR camera for years and finally I got one and I couldn't be happier!

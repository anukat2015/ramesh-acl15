Title: First Apple computer, so far so good.
Content:
I'm a college student so after my Gateway laptop crapped out on me I got fed up dealing with viruses and unnecessary hassles of another PC laptop so I decided to look into Macbooks.  I've had this Macbook for a few days now and I absolutely love it!  It's sleek, lightweight, and very simple to operate.  I've started doing some of my homework on here, which requires the usual Microsoft Office type stuff, and haven't had any of those dreaded "conversion" horror stories.  The two things that bothers me is the place keys on the keyboard shows smudges relatively easy, same thing with the monitor since it has a glossy texture.  Other than those minor things, I'm very pleased with this laptop.

Title: iPod nano 16GB
Content:
I purchased this product to replace an older iPod.  I have had it for only a month, and it has already frozen four times.  Also, a few of the settings, such as 24-hour clock, keep unsetting themselves.  Hopefully future updates will fix these problems.  As far as the extra memory, the artwork display and new features, I am happy.  I have yet to use the "genius" feature, though.

Title: I Adore It As Well...
Content:
The software is a little cumbersome, though; not streamlined enough. All in all, perfect mp3 player. Clips easily to your person, doesn't skip and boasts great fidelity. Inconspicuous jams! It's also ergonomic enough to where you don't have to look at it to use it. This should be the only flash-based mp3 player you need.

Title: New to DSLR's...
Content:
This is my first DSLR. I saw it on promo at a local electronics store with the extra lens - It was the best deal I saw on a DSLR. So, I went and read the reviews on this camera and decided to take the plunge.
I take loads of pictures of my dogs (show dogs) and thought this camera would give me more definition and clarity...and it does not disappoint.
I simply LOVE this camera. The pictures are awesome and for a newby to the DSLR world, it is fairly easy to learn (although there is loads more for me to learn and I intend on doing my homework). This camera makes you want to learn cause the pictures are so awesome and if it's doing such a great job on automatic, I just can't imagine all the things it'll do once I learn a bit more.
My friend went and bought a 14 mp Sony and although it is nice, the pictures are no better and the price tag was much heftier...and without the extra lens. Nope...I made the RIGHT DECISION.
I'm starting to invest in some accessories. I really want the 300mm lens, but just can't afford it right now (any hints on a good alternative?). I bought a 500/1000 lens for long shots...now I need a monopod cause that lens makes my camera shake (too long to keep your hand steady). I'm also looking at the LOWEPRO 350 which will take both the camera and accessories as well as my 17" laptop - think that will be my next purchase!
BUY THIS CAMERA - it's simply AWESOME!!!

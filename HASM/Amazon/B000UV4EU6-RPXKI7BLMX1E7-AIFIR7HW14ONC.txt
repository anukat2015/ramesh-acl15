Title: Good, not great
Content:
Nice look, nicer quality, good picture.
Nice size memory, and then it fails after that in review....!
The player has and awesome expansion slot how cool.. but not?
It's pretty useless as you can not use any option on the flash drive just a click and play and thats it. 
Looks like a tad more work is needed on software, if they had nailed
that it would have been well worth it.
A stupid careless thing to do, that and the expansion drive thats pretty useless.
For that it lost a 5 star to a three what a pity.

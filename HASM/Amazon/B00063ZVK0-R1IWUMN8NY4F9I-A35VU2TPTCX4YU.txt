Title: Vornado EH1-0028 Great Product
Content:
I purchased the Vornado EH1-0028 based on reviews I read on the Web. I have had it one month and have not been disappointed. I'm using it to heat a 12'x16' shop. I normally work late in the evening in my shop which is insulated. We had an unexpected early fall temperatures with daytime highs in the lower 40's and nightime temps in the upper 20's. My plan is to turn on the heater a hour or so before I plan to work in the shop.One evening the inside temp was 42 degress.  I turned on the Vornado to high to let the shop warm up. In one hour the temperature was up to 58 and within the next 30 minutes it was a comfy 72 degrees. It warms the entire shop area with no hotspots. It's a little strange not feeling really hot air blow out like most space heaters. I really like that once it reaches the preset temperature it maintains that exact temperature until I turn it off. It's quiet and works better than I expected. I'm glad I bought it.

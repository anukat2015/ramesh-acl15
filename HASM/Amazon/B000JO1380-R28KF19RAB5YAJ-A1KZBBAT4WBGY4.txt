Title: all your music in one place!
Content:
I've had this product for over 2 years now. I don't remember exactly when I bought it. It has been working
fine ever since I purchased it. Sure it will crash every now and then. Just google your problems and your
problems will be solved. I have not used up all the space either. I want to get the 160gb model. As
my music collection is growing. 
I don't know how I would function in life with out this product. I use it everyday. I immediately
hook it up into my car stereo, use it at work, use it while walking, etc. This is the perfect mp3 player to get if you're
a music junkie like me. If your collection continues to grow then you'll want an iPod with more capacity. I have
not touched a single CD since I bought the iPod. I'll rip the CD to my computer and never touch it. I love my mp3's. For one
they never skip, they never wear out. They are reliable. I love my iPod and so glad I had bought one all those years ago. Again
I don't remember when exactly I bought it.

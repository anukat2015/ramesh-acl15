Title: They havnt' shipped the item after 5 weeks.
Content:
I would like to review the item but they have not shipped the item.
I ordered on 10/15/04 and as of today's date 11/22/04 the item has not been shipped. Shipping date has been pushed back twice. Now the est. ship date is 11/29/04 to 12/6/04. I may receive the item after waiting two months. Amazon stil lists the item as ususally ships in 1 - 2 weeks. Don't believe it.
Bottom line if you need the heater this winter don't bother ordering this unit. If you need it for winter of 2006 you should be fine.

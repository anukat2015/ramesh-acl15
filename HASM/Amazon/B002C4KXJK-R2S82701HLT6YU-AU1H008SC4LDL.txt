Title: Great small laptop, but
Content:
Pros: 
Lightweight
Cons:
Not really Ubuntu friendly (camera, mic, touchpad)
Short battery life (~2:30h).
Fan is constantly working (too noisy)
Poor webcam
Battery is not fixed well and moves couple millimeters back and forth
Lots of people complain about the keyboard, but it is not so really bad, I would give it 3.5 out of 5

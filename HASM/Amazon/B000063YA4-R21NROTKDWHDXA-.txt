Title: Great pictures, hefty price
Content:
I'm basically a point and shoot kinda guy. Before this I owned a run of the mill Olympus D-490. Wow, what a difference. I've been snapping away for over 2 weeks with this little gem and am shocked at the picture quality. It's amazing what a little jump in technology can do. This X3 chip produces great color, fantastic detail and it's easy enough to have running in minutes, providing you have all the batteries, and it takes alot. The downsides are that it's heavy, like a couple of pounds w/ the lens and flash (sold separately). It's expensive, try shelling out 1.5k USD and telling your wife it's for a camera. Ouch. It requires Sigma software - I think if your going to charge an arm and a leg for a camera, it should take images in a standardized format. I appreciate the fact that the images in "sigma" format are infinitely manipulatable, but geesh. At least give us a choice if we want all that control in every shot. The pics cant be blown up very much. Now as an aside, I'm no master with the software yet, but on Hi quality with autofocus on the darn thing makes great pics, but viewing at anything over 2:1 magnification in Paint Shop produces pixelated images. It's a quirk, but it matters to me. Other than that, like I said, images are great. It's fun to run because it's so much like a pro-shot camera, but still easy enough for the average PHD to run it.

Title: Bad Coffee Maker
Content:
This is a well priced perculator that looks good but it quit working after 2 weeks.  The guts were a little hard to line up and install after putting the coffee in but that is something I could live with.  However, after 2 weeks use the pot started leaking --- big wet spot where the pot was sitting.  Bottom Line --- this is JUNK do not waste your money on it.

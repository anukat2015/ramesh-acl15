Title: Was great for a short time
Content:
We bought it because we have cats that shed.
The first 6 months we used it the self propelled-carpet suction was great.  
After that it seem that the self propelled wasn't really working,
and after that the carpet feature only worked sometimes.  
Finally the carpet feature didn't work at all and we had to have it repaired.
The hard floor works better than you think it does.  By that I mean it doesn't seem like you are doing much but it does actually work pretty well just as long as you don't use the carpet setting on the hard floor because it shoots the dirt everywhere.

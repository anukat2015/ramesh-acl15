Title: Heats the Room, Warms the Soul
Content:
This is my first personal heater so I can't really compare it to its competition. Regardless, it earned high marks in my criteria for a personal heater. As a reference point, I use this for a 13x13 bedroom with vaulted ceilings...
Warmth: I am warming a relatively small space, but I haven't had to put the setting above 40% to really heat the room--I generally run it around 25% of full power. Surprisingly warm for such a small unit.  
Speed/Efficiency: It takes maybe 5-10 minutes to warm a room. With the temperature regulation, there's less electrical output when the room is at a desired temperature...Many heaters around this price can cost you a good bit in electricity for that superfluous heat. This is a pretty efficient unit.
Noise: A double-edged sword. I loved putting this on at night for warmth and white noise, but when watching TV, the buzz impedes the sound a bit, about the same level as when you have the air conditioner on--a subtle distraction. But given its quick heating of a room, you can turn it off after 15 minutes and be fine for a good bit.
Bottom Line: A great investment for, say, a basement (them suckers are always cold)...enough power to do the job in a large space, but efficient enough to keep the electricity bills down.
***I happened to get this thing for $22 so I am extra-pleased with my purchase.

Title: Misrepresented inventory status
Content:
When product was ordered the supplier claimed 'ships within 24 hours'. Five days later I was informed that they had no product in inventory and shipment would be delayed at least two more weeks. Not very truthful. And the only way they provide to cancel is to place a long distance call at my expense. Amazon needs to rethink this cancellation procedure.

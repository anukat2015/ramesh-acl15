Title: Replaced twice, still defective
Content:
I bought one of these a few weeks ago. Loaded software, charged player, downloaded songs. After about 10 minutes of playing, screen went black, couldn't charge, it was just dead. Ordered a replacement. This time it played for maybe 15 minutes, and then the exact same thing happened. It is truly a piece of junk.

Title: great little heater that keeps me warm on a budget
Content:
Holmes makes an excellent compact and portable ceramic space heater that really gives off a lot of heat than my older one does! Moreover, the unit is very lightweight and easy to carry although of course I wouldn't carry it while it's working or just after it's been shut off. 
The heater is reasonably priced as of the time I am writing this and I sure hope that Holmes continues to make these; I would like to get one for my father. The unit is completely quiet--in fact it's so quiet that you'll never know that it's there unless you see it. It rapidly provides a good amount of heat to areas like bedrooms and offices.  
This heater by Holmes is best used for spaces that are roughly 100 square feet or slightly more; I wouldn't depend on it to heat several rooms or a combination living room/dining room all at once. For that you'll either need more than one of these space heaters or you'll have to use this unit along with your central heat or oil heat, whatever you have. 
I also like that the unit turns itself off automatically of it should accidentally tip over. That's good protection against fire or ugly marks on your carpeting that could be tough to remove. 
If you look at the fourth picture of the unit at the top of this page, you can see for yourself the way you can control the temperature. You get "on" and "off" buttons; and there are five specific temperatures from which to choose. You can adjust the temperature a bit more simply by pushing the "hi" and "lo" buttons. Great!
Again, this is one awesome space heater that's more than worth the current price. I highly recommend it.

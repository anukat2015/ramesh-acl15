Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
I was very excited waiting for this machine to be delivered (bought on ebay), but was very disappointed when it did. The outside quality is very poor and the instruction manual is not helpful. The machine makes good drip coffee and espresso, but making the milk frother work takes time. Also there is an unidentified compartment above the milk frother (not mentioned in the manual but visible on the picture). I still have no idea what that's for. I tried to contact Delonghi Customer Service, but did not get a reply. The plus is that it's easy to clean and it has additional features such as flavor sensor. It's by far not the best coffee maker ever but good enough for the price. The mystery compartment still makes me a little nervous though.

Title: a time saver
Content:
I've had mine about a year and am very happy with it. I have 6 cats and a dog and a busy life, so my kitchen floor is often dreadful. I generally sweep the big chunks before using the vacuum function and that works well. The actual scrubbing part works like a dream and cleaning my large floor area (tile) is twice as fast as manually mopping.  An extra pass or two cleans what I would have had to be down on knees scrubbing.  I am also delighted at how dry it leaves the floor when I am done; no wet patches, no puddles that have to be picked up separately.  It makes my life easier and I am grateful!

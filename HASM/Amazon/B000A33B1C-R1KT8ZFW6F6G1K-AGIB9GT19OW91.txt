Title: One Problem
Content:
Just a short review with one concern. First this is a great heater as stated in all of the other reviews, that is why I bought it. Heats up quite slow but that is what oil filled heaters do, does not use a lot of energy/electric which is a big plus.
The concern is that I live in the west which as we all know is desert and very dry. After using the heater for a few weeks my skin became dry, mostly on my face, this had not been a problem before, I had to start using a lot of cream on my face because of the dryness, it has warmed up here the last few weeks so I have not used the heater and the dry skin has gone away. 
I do not remember reading this in any of the other reviews but this is a big problem. Since winter is almost over this is something I will have to deal with next winter.

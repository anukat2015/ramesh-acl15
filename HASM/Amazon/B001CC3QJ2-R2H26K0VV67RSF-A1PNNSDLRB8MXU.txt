Title: Lenovo U110 notebook
Content:
I have had the Lenovo U110 IdeaPad for about a month now.  The notebook functions very well and I am using it for browsing, MS office, and Quickbooks.  
What I like:
  - The slim design and light weight
  - The large keys
  - The bright crisp display
  - Reasonable performance
  - Overall look and feel
  - Red color is nice and the Klingon looking A/V keys are kind of cool
What I don't like
  - No TrackPoint (like the ThinkPad models)
  - No keyboard light (like the Thinkpad models)
  - No option for MS Windows Professional or Windows XP
  - No option for high speed disk drive
  - Detached but very large DVD writer
  - Shiny key caps always have fingerprints
  - Very flimsy LCD display housing - it flexes and separates when you grab it.  
Should have got the small ThinkPad instead.  Not as cool looking but better functionality

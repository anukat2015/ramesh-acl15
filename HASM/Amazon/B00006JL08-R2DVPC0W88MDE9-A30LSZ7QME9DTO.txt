Title: Reliable Coffee Maker Produces Consistent Quality Results
Content:
This is our second Braun KF580. Our first unit gave us several years of excellent service and was working fine when we decided to replace it for cosmetic reasons -- brown staining that had built up on the upper surface of the unit.  We had also inflicted a small chip on the carafe. Our first unit will serve as a backup should we need to brew more than 10 cups when entertaining.
Because we so enjoyed this unit, particularly its ease of operation and consistent quality coffee, we searched on line for a replacement unit (we were  not able to find it in retail outlets such as Beth, Bath & Beyond, where we bought the original unit).
While the new unit (like its predecessor) has some minor flaws -- a filter basket that sometimes must be repositioned to enable its holder to close properly, and a carafe lip that requires some care when pouring to avoid spills -- we are very satisfied with its overall performance. The timer function was particularly important to us.  It works flawlessly and is simple to operate.  Newer coffee makers on the market come in all sizes, shapes and colors, some with complex operating requirements and very small buttons.  This unit is easy top operate, attractive in appearance, and has proven reliability.  We recommend it highly.

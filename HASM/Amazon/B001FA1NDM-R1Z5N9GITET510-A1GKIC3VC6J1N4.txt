Title: great iPod nano
Content:
Actually I have used iPod nano 1st generation before, however a rain ruined the iPod. I can't live without a mp3 player, so I decided to buy another iPod. I saw the picture online and decided to buy iPod 4th generation. When I received it, I found it is great as I thought. I should say it is thicker than 1st generation and is easy to control it.

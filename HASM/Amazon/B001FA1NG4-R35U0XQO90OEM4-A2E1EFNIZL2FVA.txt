Title: Super lightweight!  Beautiful color choices
Content:
The IPOD I chose is the 8gb; I am quite sure I can fill it up, as it will hold 2,000 songs.  As for pictures, I don't need to do that.  But I certainly want to experiment with videos.  I don't use it for Podcasts or books.  To me, an IPOD is strictly for music!
I chose the beautiful blue and ultra thin Ipod.  It is light in weight.  Easy to store in the pocket for walking.  What I experiences most is that the music seemed to remain at a constant acceptable level than my older IPOD.  The 2 inch screen is a nice size.  I can view the CD covers well enough.  However, I don't seem to get enough screen size for any games.  
Especially important is viewing the CD images in varying formats, like CoverFlow which lets the images flow through the screen.  You can turn the Ipod sideways and view the images.   And what I really like is the Song List has the song title and the artist, rather than my older one with just the song title.  
A new feature to me is the Shake to Shuffle.  Although I haven't had enough experience, I doubt that I will use it much.  The off/on/lock button at the top is quite small and thin, making it difficult to ensure locking it.  You need to get a good grasp of it.  Enjoyable! ....... Rizzo

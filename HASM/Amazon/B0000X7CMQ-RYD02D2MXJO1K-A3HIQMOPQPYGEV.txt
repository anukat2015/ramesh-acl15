Title: The carafe is great to keep it fresh!
Content:
I bought this coffee maker because I wanted one of those steel carafes that doesn't keep cooking the coffee - and this one works beautifully in that regard.  It's a bit tall, so you have to pull it out from under the cabinet.  The dang filters are no big deal, some folks were saying they have to cut them, or they don't fit, maybe if your a bit obsessive about perfectly fitting coffee filters, but that isn't as much of an issue as how tall the thing is.  The coffee stays hot for several hours as long as the lid is screwed on tight.  I don't like the little cap thing you have to put on so no heat escapes, it should be connected to the pot or something, we're constantly having to find a place to plunk it down without it getting in the way and the pot won't fit back on the coffee maker after that little lid is on, but I guess they figure IT DOESN'T HAVE TO, you can take it RIGHT to the table because there is not hot pad to keep cooking it - so that much is true :)

Title: Best DSLR I have ever owned
Content:
Well, that's not saying too much.  I got this camera to complement the Nikon D80, while shooting weddings.  You could say that I am the proverbial "serious amateur."  I have lots to learn about, both, the D80 and the D200. I have found that D200 will grow with me.  As complex as the D200 can be, I'm finding it easier to use than the D80.  Meaning that, I find the function modes easier to change than the D80.  I like the ISO, QUAL and WB function button all together on top, very nice.  Don't get me wrong, I love my D80, but the D200 is definately "a step above."  When you put this camera in your hand, you know you have definately stepped away from the proverbial "point and shoot."  There aren't any automatic modes options.  For the most part, this camera is fully manual.  And, it makes manual more fun to learn.  Great camera.  What's next Nikon?

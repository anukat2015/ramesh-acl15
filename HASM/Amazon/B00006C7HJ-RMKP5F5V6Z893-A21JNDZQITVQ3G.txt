Title: Don't buy this heater
Content:
I really can't say that unequivocally but based on my recent experience and the stack of negative comments I've perused on this site, I think this should be blurted out. We had ours for about 2 months before it stopped working. I'd heard about the recall (faulty switch) but procrastinated on taking action. Then it quit so it seemed a good time to  send it back (my labor and box, their freight bill). In the meantime I bought a $17 one at a box store that worked fine - not real senstive, but quiet and steady. I just got the Vornado back and turned it on. It filled the job-site trailer with a haze that reminded me of burning plastic army soldiers - not that I ever did that..... We'll see how long before I have to plug cheapo back in.

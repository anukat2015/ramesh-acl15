Title: We LOVE It!!
Content:
First of all - we have had some good coffee pots in our time and this is by far the best of show!
It keeps coffee hot all day and trust me - I like my coffee hot and would always have to re-warm in the microwave ... no more!  Hours after we brew a full pot I can go back for that 3rd cup and the coffee is still hot - nice and hot!
Ours does not leak - it works perfectly!  The lid is great - everything is just GREAT!  What a find!  I promise this is the coffee pot you have been looking for :)

Title: Sweat ruins iPod Shuffles
Content:
I would love everything about the new iPod EXCEPT that I use it to go running (about 1 hour at a time) and the normal sweat from my body gets into the jack and ruins it.  
I had to replace my 1st generation iPOD 3 times due to sweating on it. The store clerk kept saying it wasn't made to be sweated on. But I would say the #1 use of any iPOD is for exercise.  
i thought the new design would fix the problem but it hasn't.  I need to get a new on after 2 weeks of running with it.  The next one I will have to wrap in plastic and kept in in a pouch away from my body to kept it from getting sweat on it.

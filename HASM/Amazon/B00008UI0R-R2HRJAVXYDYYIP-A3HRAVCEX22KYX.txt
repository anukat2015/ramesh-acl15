Title: wind tunnel
Content:
The best vacuum we ever bought! with two golden retrievers and one flat coat retriever in the house we needed a vac that picked up dog hair and general cleaning. I vacuumed with our old vac and shampooed our carpets before the holidays and then recieved our new wind tunnel bagless you would not believe what was in the bagless cup, even though you have to empty the cup often the suction of this vacuum is great my wife only run the vac at half speed.I would not want to see what it pulls out of carpet at full speed this vac is great!

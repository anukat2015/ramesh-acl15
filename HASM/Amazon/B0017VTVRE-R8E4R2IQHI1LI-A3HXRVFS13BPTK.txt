Title: Best vacuum EVER!
Content:
I have a dog who sheds (a lot) and my children and I have allergies and asthma.  My allergist recommended that I vacuum every day.  But the problem was that I *hated* vacuuming - my old vacuum got stuck under my kichen cabinets, had a short hose that couldn't reach high enough to do any dusting, and (although it was a 'hepa' model) it was dirty and dusty.  Vacuuming was frustrating and irritating.
It was time for a new vacuum cleaner and so I went to an actual vacuum cleaner store to try out different models.  Prior to that visit, I had never even heard of the Miele.  After trying out several Dyson models, it was love at first sight with the Miele Callisto!  I came home and vacuumed with my old Hoover wind tunnel, then immediately vacuumed with the Miele and couldn't believe how much it picked up!  I'm not the type of person who could have ever imagined myself paying this much for a vacuum cleaner, but I'm so glad I did!!  It was worth it!!
Here's my summary:
What I like:
* It's so easy to use that I don't mind vacuuming and dusting (as much!).
* The Miele picks up dog hair from all floor types - carpet, linoleum, tile, and hardwood.  Yeah!
* I don't sneeze while I'm vacuuming because it's not spitting out any dusty exhaust.
* There's a special setting to use (with lower suction) for cleaning curtains.
* The hose is powered, so the beater brush is powered (I didn't care for the Miele models with air-powered brushes).
* The attachments (except for the hardwood floor attachment) fit on the unit so they won't get lost.
* The turbobrush head swivels, which makes it very easy to vacuum around tables, couches, whatever.
* The Miele has really good suction right up until it's time to change the bag.  My Hoover would have great suction for a few times, and then went downhill fast!
* This Miele has a telescoping wand which makes it super easy to clean the tops of paintings, ceiling fans, and chandeliers.
* It's small, and light, and doesn't take up much space in my closet.  My old Hoover was a tank... big, awkward, and heavy!
What I didn't like:
* The power cord is too short.  If it was about 5' longer, it would be perfect.
* The consumables (bags, HEPA filter) are expensive.

Title: This lap top suits me fine.
Content:
I purchased this lap top off TV - had no previous experience with the particular model. It was shipped to me in a week. I have had absolutely no problems with it. All the softwear  is fine - no issues with the ethernet/wy-fi, DVD drive/burner etc. I down loaded iTunes, have a couple of thousand songs on it- no problem...
It may not be a fancy (read "expensive")or trendy (read "apple") model, but then I am neither fancy, trendy nor expensive myself. I am happy with my purchase - it suits my needs.

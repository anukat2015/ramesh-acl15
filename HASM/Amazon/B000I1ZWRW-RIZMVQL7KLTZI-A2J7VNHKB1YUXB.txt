Title: I love this XTi Rebel!!!
Content:
I bought this for my boyfriend's (now husband) b-day back in March.  We both have only been accustomed to using point & shoot digital cameras.  This Rebel is very user friendly and takes GREAT pics!  The 10.1MP allows you to take beautiful shots and you can print enlargements that look professional!
The only draw-back I have is that it doesn't allow you to use the LCD monitor to take the pics, only for viewing pictures already taken.  Something about the mirrors.....blah blah blah.  But we're used to it now.
Other than that, we use the camera on a weekly basis. 
Thanks Canon for making such a camera at such an affordable price.

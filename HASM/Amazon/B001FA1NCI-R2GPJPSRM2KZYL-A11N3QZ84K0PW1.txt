Title: 4th Gen is a Bomb.
Content:
I got this Ipod as an upgrade to my old Ipod Nano and this one is definitely a bomb. It crashed all the time, mostly when I'm updating my library leaving it completely blank.  
The shuffle feature is downright annoying, it changes the song even while walking down the street and apple provides no way to turn it off.    
I really enjoyed using apple products but no longer,  I have try a different brand next time.

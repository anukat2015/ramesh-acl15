Title: thinking i made a mistake
Content:
Everyone said you need to buy a mac so i did.  Even though there are some awesome apps., I am not blown away like I was expecting.  Do I have anytime to learn how to play guitar?...no.   I wonder...would I have done better buying something cheaper, while getting the same satisfaction.   I bought this for durability, so I will wait and see.

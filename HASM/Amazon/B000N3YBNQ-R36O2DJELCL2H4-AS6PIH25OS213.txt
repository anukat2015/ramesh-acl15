Title: Electrolux EL5020A
Content:
This is a small upright vacuum cleaner.  I was attracted to the light weight and the folding design.  Unfortunately, this vacuum is difficult to maneuver, requiring significant force to push it across a carpet.  Furthermore, it leaves unattractive marks on the carpet.  I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner to anyone.

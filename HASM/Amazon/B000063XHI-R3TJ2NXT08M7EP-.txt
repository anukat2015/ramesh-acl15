Title: Great coffee maker
Content:
This coffee maker has a lot going for it...thermal carafe so coffee stays hot without burning, makes great tasting coffee, easy to program, great looking on the counter. Downsides: quite noisy when it is making coffee, no measurement marks on the carafe to help gauge amount of water putting in the tank. But those are small nitpicks...overall it was worth every penny!

Title: Great camera
Content:
I am a amateur photographer who wanted something that would take good pictures of my daughter and her friends. I love the quality of the pictures I have taken with this camera. It focuses fast and has taken very good pictures even when the kids where running towards me.  I have used 5 different point and shoots (all over $300 and heavily researched) and this is much faster with better quality.

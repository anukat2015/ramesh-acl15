Title: Fastest & easiest way to get one mug of boiling water
Content:
I've always had one or two Hot Shots since they first came out in the 1970's.  It's the perfect simple little machine for the office or dorm room, or even master bathroom if you want a cup of tea without trekking to the kitchen.
Because you heat only exactly as much water as you need, it's faster than using my fancy expensive electric kettles, and much much faster than a cheapo hot pot.  Note, though, that tall "tankard" style coffee mugs won't fit under the dispenser nozzle. 
It won't last you forever, but will last for several years of daily or daily-plus use, in my experience.  Great little appliance.

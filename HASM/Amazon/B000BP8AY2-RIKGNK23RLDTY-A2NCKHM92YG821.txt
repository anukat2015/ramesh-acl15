Title: Beware!!!
Content:
This product is horrible and frustrating and a giant waste of money and time.  It stops functioning about every two weeks.  None of the "fixes" I've downloaded from the web site have fixed the problem.  The only thing you can do is completely reformat it, wiping it clean, and start over.  Of course, you can't do this at the gym!  Sometimes it won't communicate with the computer, other times it just won't play.  There are much better products on the market.  Save yourself and don't buy a SanDisk!!!

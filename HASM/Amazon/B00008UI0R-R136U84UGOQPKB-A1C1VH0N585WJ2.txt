Title: Worth the money
Content:
Great price and an excellent product.  Great power and aggitator brush - fluffs up carpet.  Did a test, vacuumed with our 8yr old unit, then revacuumed again over same area, this unit picked up  signigicant more dirt.
Keeps carpets clean and fluffy - which is what we wanted

Title: Great little heater- exactly what I wanted
Content:
I love this little heater, and it is little.  And personal.  You can set it on
your desk, or right by your feet, just for a little warmth right by you.  It doesn't get real hot, just a nice warmth lightly blowing on you.  Most heaters scare me, I'm afraid I am going to catch something on fire.  This one doesn't scare me!

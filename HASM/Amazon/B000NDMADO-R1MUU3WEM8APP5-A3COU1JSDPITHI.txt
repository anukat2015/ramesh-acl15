Title: Pass from the Dyson DC21
Content:
I always wanted a Dyson canister vac so when this one had a price drop I jumped at the chance.  First, I have hardwood floors throughout 90% of my house; so how much could I love it....not much.
There suction is weak at best and the floor tool is poorly designed.  I then sent back and went a local vacuum store and purchased a Miele Antares S4210.  What a difference in design, suction, and quality.
Pass on the Dyson and go w/ the Miele.  You will not be sorry.

Title: Great... if you don't let the little things get to you
Content:
Overall, I love this mp3 player, and would definitely recommend it.  It's so pretty - looks a lot nicer in person than in the stock photos.  The lighter part is a dark metallic grey, the darker part is black with a subtle hint of black sparkles.  The backlight can be set to a wide array of colors - not just blue.
That being said, here are a few little downsides to keep in mind, that I didn't see in other reviews:
- There are only 3 repeat modes: repeat 1, repeat all, and off.  I'm used to Creative products, which have a good dozen repeat modes to choose from.
- The menu navigation is less intuitive than that of the Creative Muvo Tx FM, for example.  The left button moves down, the right one moves up.  This catches me off guard every time.
- The on/off button doubles as a lock switch, preventing any keypresses from registering while the lock is on.  Sliding to the left turns it off (after a few seconds), sliding it to the right locks it.  The problem is that when taking it out of lock, you have to be EXTREMELY careful not to let it slide too far to the left, or it will restart the mp3 that's currently playing.  Which makes it difficult to adjust the volume mid-song.
- While it looks flat in the stock photos, in actuality most of the AAA is housed in its own bulbous compartment at the back of the device.  Making it quite a bit fatter than it appears.
Again, none of these minor annoyances render the Pearl unusable, but they might be enough to ruin the experience for some people.

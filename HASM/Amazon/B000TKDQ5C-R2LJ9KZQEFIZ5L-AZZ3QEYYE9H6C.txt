Title: Great Little Heater!  No complaints here.
Content:
This is a great little heater at a good price.  I do not understand how anyone gave this a bad rating.  It isn't loud, it's small, it works great, and its inexpensive!  The building that I work in does not keep a consistent temperature throughout the day, so when its freezing in here I need something to give some extra warmth.  This was perfect!  I think it would even work well in a large room.  I definitely recommend this heater.

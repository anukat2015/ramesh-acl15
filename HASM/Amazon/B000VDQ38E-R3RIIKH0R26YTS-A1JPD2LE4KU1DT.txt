Title: Great product
Content:
Works very well. Easy to use. Attachments are wonderful. A bit heavier than my old vacuum but the hose is so long I can vacuum the staircase without having to ever carry it up the stairs. A must have for any pet owner. It picks up dust and pet hair you never knew you had. It is quite loud, however, the only negative thing I have found.  Highly recommend this product.

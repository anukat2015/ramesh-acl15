Title: What can I say that hasn't already been said?
Content:
I love this camera!  Bought it to replace my DSLR-like Panasonic DMC-FZ10.  The pictures it takes BLOWS away my old Panny and not because of 10 megapixel vs 4, but because of the USABLE ISO settings!  I took indoor shots at Christmas this year using no flash what-so-ever and using ISO 1600.  With my old camera, the images would've been so dark and grainy that they wouldn't have been usable.  With this camera, the pictures are great, crisp and have just a little motion blur in them, not to mention a GREAT DOF!  The kit lens isn't the greatest (I'm saving up to buy a lens with a similar focal length but with built-in image stabilization), but it's a good start.  Get this camera, use the kit lens for a while until you can afford to buy some really nice glass and you will have one AWESOME setup! :D

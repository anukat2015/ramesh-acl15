Title: Good heater, energy efficient and quiet
Content:
My wife and I really enjoy having this heater. We save a lot of money heating up only the room we're in, rather than heating the entire house. It is quiet and heats a room evenly, unlike those radiant heaters that heat a single area. 
There are no exposed hot coils, nor does the external casing get hot. I would consider this fairly safe if you have pets or children around who may get too close. 
It does draw enough power, especially on the high setting, to blow a fuse if another heater or hair dryer is powered on the same circuit within the house. Be aware when you have this on so that other powerful electrical devices aren't used simultaneously on the same circuit.
I wish I could say it heats a room quickly, but our insulation is poor and we lose a lot of heat through our windows. I can't blame the heater for that. 
Overall a good purchase.

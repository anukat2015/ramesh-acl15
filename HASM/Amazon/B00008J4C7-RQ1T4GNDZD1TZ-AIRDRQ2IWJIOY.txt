Title: I found replacement filters!!!!!
Content:
To Carol in Federal Way - go to www.sharkcompany.com.  You'll find the replacement filters there at a reasonable price.  I agree with your review.  I like this vacuum. I have several and this one seems to pick up the most.  Granted the container is small (for a house with kids and pets) but for the price, the easy to stow size, it is worth it for those with wood floors.  Can't advise on the carpet action as I don't have any.

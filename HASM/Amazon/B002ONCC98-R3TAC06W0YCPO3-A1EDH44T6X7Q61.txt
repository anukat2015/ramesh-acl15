Title: Great laptop
Content:
I got this laptop on a Black Friday special as a desktop replacement. Came with Windows 7. Battery life is fair and it's a little on the heavy side. Since I use it at home no big deal. Has built in card readers and web cam. Good storage, good processor, and a very nice 17" screen. Has worked flawlessly. Very very happy with my purchase from Amazon. Look forward to their Black Friday deals again. Maybe I can land that big screen LED I'm dreaming about.

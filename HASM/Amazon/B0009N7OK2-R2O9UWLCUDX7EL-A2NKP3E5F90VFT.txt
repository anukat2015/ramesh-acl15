Title: Poor Quality, Big Price
Content:
I own the Archos AV400 and owned the model before it, so I expected the Archos AV700 to be a step up. It's a step backwards. It records, then during playback distorts the image. It looks foggy and grainy with lines. When I called Archos, I was told that there are no settings to adjust to improve the image. Needless to say I returned it 4 hours after buying it. 
Archos should not be in such a rush to be pioneers (7" screen) that they release products before they are perfected.

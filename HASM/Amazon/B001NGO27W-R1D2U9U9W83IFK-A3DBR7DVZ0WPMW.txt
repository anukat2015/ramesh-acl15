Title: Makes good coffee easy.
Content:
Have only had this about a month so this is a short term review. I am satisfied with the coffee it makes.The taste is better than the Gevalia we had and it is nice and rich, keeps the coffee hot (unlike the Gevalia) and does not take long to brew. Easy to pour water in but a pain to take the lid off constantly to refill the pot and then to take off to clean every day. Sometimes we just rinse after using. Like the reusable filter although sometimes we use the paper filters. Auto set brew timer works great also. If it lasts it will be a good purchase.

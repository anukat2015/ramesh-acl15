Title: Can't say enough good about this camera
Content:
This was my entry level purchase getting into dSLR cameras.
I could not be more pleased with this camera.
There is a learning curve, even coming from Canon AE-1 film camera.
It is so nice to have a 10.1 MP digital camera!
Make sure you buy a 133X 4 GB Compact Flash card to go with it.  It really eats up the memory cards when you take lots of shots.  You will take lots of shots!

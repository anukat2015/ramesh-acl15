Title: My favorite space heater Ever!
Content:
It's so quiet you can't even tell if it's on... but you're toasty warm! The high setting makes a low amount of fan noise and a Lot of heat. BTW, I got mine for free: someone left it at the campground. I opened it up, blew the dust wad out and it has worked non-stop for a year. When it fills up with dust the thermostat will shut it off after a few minutes, but that takes a long time to occur. Just clean it out once a year and you'll be thrilled with this quiet, inexpensive and effective heater :-D

Title: Disapointed
Content:
UPDATE: I am a big fan of Sony products. While Amazon is not always the cheapest place to get something, they do offer the best customer service ever. I had my bf purchase this for me at the end of Jan last year, didn't use it for months and it worked fine and in Dec I started having problems with it charging. I thought it was my computer, then thought it was media player and then bought a new cord only to find out that many people had problems with it charging. Sony wants you to pay more to get it fixed and so I contacted amazon with an e-mail saying I could return it with chances of some of my money coming back. I called customer service and explained to them the situation and they offered to replace it since I've never returned anything in the 7+ years I've purchased from them. So to the buyers who look for a deal, you'll never get as good of customer service than from Amazon.

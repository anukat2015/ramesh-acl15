Title: Great machine
Content:
After reading all the reviews on varius bagless, canister vacuums I decided on ths Hoover WindTunnel and I'm glad I did. It was a little embarrassing though using this vacuum right after my old bagged canister because the cup was almost full!
The only real change I'd recommend is to have a softer, more flexible hose because this one is pretty stiff and un-ruly. Other than that I love it.

Title: Great heater for a good price.
Content:
I purchased this heater a little over 2 weeks ago and I use it almost every day.  I really like it because it was a good price, it came in the mail quickly, it doesn't take up a lot of space, and it does a good job.  Some people may consider it noisy but you will definitely hear a constant fan sound.  I don't mind it because I've had heaters like this in the past.  I get used to it and tune it out.  I just wish it had a timer!  That would make it a 4.5.  No noise would be 5 but again the noise does not bother me.

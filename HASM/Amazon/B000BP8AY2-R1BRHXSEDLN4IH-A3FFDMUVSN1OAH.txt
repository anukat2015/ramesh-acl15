Title: Just Okay
Content:
I bought this MP3 player within the last 3 weeks. It was great the first week, I enjoyed the fact it wasn't too big or bulky, and was easy to use. However, after that first week I noticed it often would not power up when I tried to turn it on. And now it has begun to shut itself off at random. I never used it excessively, less than an hour at a time, not every day certainly. No idea why it has suddenly gone bad.

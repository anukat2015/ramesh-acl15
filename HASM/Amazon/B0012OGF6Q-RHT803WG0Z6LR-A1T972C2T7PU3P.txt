Title: Good camera for beginners
Content:
I received my camera two weeks ago and am quite pleased with it. I owned a Minolta Dimage S414 with 4 Mega Pixles before. I have taken over 50 pictures with this camera so far and am extremly pleased with it, since I am a beginner in Ditital SLR. I would recommend this camera to anyone.

Title: Excellent medium sized room heater.
Content:
I purchased this heater because of it's high Consumer Reports rating and it's perfect configuration for setting in front of a fireplace. It radiates heat 10-12 feet out from it's front. It is quiet and performs as advertised. I have 2 DeLonghi oil heaters, and I am extremely satisfied with all these products. I have pets that sleep next to this heater just like they would a roaring wood fire (when I'm actually using the fireplace).

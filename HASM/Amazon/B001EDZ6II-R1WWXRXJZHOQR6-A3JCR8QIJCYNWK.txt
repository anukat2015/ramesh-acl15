Title: What a super little room heater!
Content:
When I was a young adult, I was amazed at the neat little room heaters that became popular.  They were basically just heating coils that generated heat out the front of the little metal box that sat on the floor.  They were power drains.  They were dangerous.
Technology has gotten better and better.  Now, with our Vornado, following the instructions, we can strategically place it in a room and it creates a vortex of air that deflects itself around the entire room.  This little device packs a punch.  
Sometimes, my wife wants instant gratification when her feet are cold.  She will aim it at her feet in the conventional way we used space heaters.  This little gem works great in that mode also.

Title: Amazazing!!
Content:
I bought the D80 a couple months ago and was having major noise issues.  My Nikon D50 (a lesser model) took better quality photos.  After exchanging the D80 several times and even sending it in for service, the issue still remained.  I was so fortunate that the D90 was released this week....I have already exchanged the D80 for the D90.  After using it for just one day, I am amazed at the quality.  I took photos at ISO 3200, and they are nearly the same quality as the D50 at ISO 400.  Nikon has finally solved their noise issues!!

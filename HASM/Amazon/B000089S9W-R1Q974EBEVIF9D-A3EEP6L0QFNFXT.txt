Title: Do not buy this.
Content:
I bought this more than one years ago at a closing sales of a grocery store. It was $9.00 there because they wanted to get rid of all of their products. Well, I bought it because it was from a good brand, and because my former coffee maker (Mr. Coffee) was broken. After I used this product, I will never buy Black & Decker products. I like my Black & Decker drill. But it seems like Black & Deker's kitchen products are not good. This coffee maker doesn't have a turn-off timer. It's just dangerous. The mechanism of dripping is pretty simple, there is just one hole without any stopping feature. This means that you can't drink coffee until it finish dripping completely. Even after it finished dripping, if you remove a jar from it, some coffee drops on the heating plate, which damages the surface of the heating plate. The plastic material of this coffee maker is not rigid. The hinge of the lid of the jar is easy to get deformation. Actually, the lid doesn't have any function, and I threw it away. 
I had several coffee makers, but this is the worst one. I learned I shouldn't buy cheap and bad things.

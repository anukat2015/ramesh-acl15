Title: Works well until you need a replacement filter
Content:
I own the Shark SV736K model.  It worked fine (plenty of power, battery life sufficient, happily sucked up whatever I put in front of it), but I'll admit that I never put it through much of a test.  It's primary function was to clean up the crumbs that seem to appear where ever my toddler goes.  The same toddler is the primary suspect in the case of the missing vacuum filter.  I ordered one through Amazon that stated it fit model SV736, but it turns out that filter did not fit SV736K, and I was unable to find one online that expressly stated SV736K.  So, I contacted the manufacturer through their email contact form.  In a nutshell, I said, "Do the filters you sell on your website fit model SV736K?"  They replied with no answer but to call them at a 1-800 number.  As a busy person, I'm a great fan of email contact forms, and I cannot recall ever getting this response.  Who has time to sit on hold?  Alas, toddler still depositing crumbs everywhere, so I finally called.  The customer service refused to answer my question until I gave her my phone number, name, and address - all of which I would have given if I knew that I could order the filters, but were completely unnecessary if not.  I recently read another review that stated a similar issue, so I'm not inclined to give the manufacturer any of my information.  I'm so frustrated with the whole thing that I'm in the market for another vacuum.

Title: Not too Happy with this Bissell
Content:
I bought this Bissell reading reviews on it and trusted the Bissell name.  Well, the good thing about this vacuum is the suction on it.  The suction of this vacuum is excellent but now for the bad thing about this vacuum is..it's very loud...very heavy and tips over easily when using the hose and the hose stretches out not too good.  I now have to replace this vacuum since it's too heavy to lift up the stairs and is a nightmare when using the hose.  I suggest passing on this vacuum if you're in the process of buying a vacuum.  I have tried other vacuums such as the Oreck..excellent vacuum but has no attachments.

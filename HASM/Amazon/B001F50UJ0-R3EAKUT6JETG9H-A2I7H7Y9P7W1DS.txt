Title: Great, inexpensive MP3 player
Content:
Yesterday I dropped and broke my 5-year old Creative Zen Micro 4GB which I was relatively happy with except for the purchase price.  After extensive reading on 4 and 8GB players, I decided on this wonderful little Sony Walkman.  Extremely easy to load music onto, small, lightweight.  The only downside is that there aren't a lot of accessories for it. I guess it's just an iPod world out there.  But since I don't need WiFi with my MP3 player, or a docking station, or loads of memory for videos, etc., this is just right for me.  And the FM tuner is surprisingly good.  Highly recommend.  Oh, I'm still waiting for my 13-item "accessory" kit which I just ordered from amazon - I got it for the little speakers so that I can use it on my desk at work.

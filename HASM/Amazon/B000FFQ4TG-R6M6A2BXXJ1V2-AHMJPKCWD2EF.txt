Title: Only Bad One out of Eight
Content:
This is about my 8th Bunn Coffee maker, and the only one that seemed to be defective. I loved this coffee maker so much, I have purchased them for several years for use @ home, office and vacation home. I wanted to have a 2nd one @ home for use of Regular and then DeCaf to support a large party we were hosting @ Easter. Unfortunately, my husband threw the box away so I couldn't return it directly to Amazon. However, I did call Bunn, explained the problem and they are offering replacement when I send the unit back w/a letter of explaination. It's truly the fastest brewer we've ever used. Normally, we enjoy it very much. This one however only produced about 8 cups of coffee when it should have had 10, was not hot enough and made a very loud noise when re-heating added water. It's obvious to me this particular unit was defective...but one out of 8 is not bad.  I will continue to purchase the Bunn.

Title: great, but needs on/off switch
Content:
This is a great product. I've owned other DeLonghi heaters and all have been very good. I like this one except that I feel the need to repost the one negative, which was one of the positives to buy it: the timer. It's great to have a programmable (not digital, analog) clock and timer. However, if you don't want to use the timer you have to turn it on and off by unplugging and replugging it in. (Per the manual.) If you really want to use the programmable feature, get it. If you only think you might want that occasionally, I'd recommend picking one with a normal on/off.

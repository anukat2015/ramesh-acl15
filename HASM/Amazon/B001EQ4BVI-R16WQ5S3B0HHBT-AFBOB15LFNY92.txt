Title: Blows my Rebel XTi Away
Content:
I was on the fence for awhile on whether I should purchase a new lens or camera body.  So I decided to upgrade my lens first and purchased the 25-70 f2.8L and saw a nice improvement with my Rebel XTi.  But it left me still wanting more detail and I was still not satisfied with the limited options I had available for manual settings/adjustments.  Then I purchased the 50D body and WOW what a difference.  The pictures are so amazingly clear and crisp.  The 50D has never had another lens attached to it.  The larger grip and layout is also fantastic and simply feels more comfortable to me to hand hold.  I now use the camera for still life studio work, family photos and chasing my daughters as they play outdoor soccer (for closer shots) and indoor basketball (amazing pictures without a flash).  Worth every penny!

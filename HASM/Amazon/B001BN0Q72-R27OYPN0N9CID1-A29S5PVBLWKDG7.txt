Title: Sony Vaio VGN-SR165E Black
Content:
Great computer.  Very lightweight.  You can put the laptop on your lap because it doesn't heat up like my previous two laptops (Dell and Compaq).  It is very lightweight.  The screen is very bright.  The computer runs very fast and starts up very fast.
Cons: Lots of installed junkware but can be removed.  The bottom of the laptop is plastics which makes it less durable.  The resolution other than the native resolution is a bit distorted.

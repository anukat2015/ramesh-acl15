Title: It's Ashame!  Love Creative...Hate The Glitches...
Content:
Try this player at your own risk...Works for some, not others.
My 3rd Creative player. Have the ZenV:M and Vision. No issues with these players, nearly flawless syncing/playing.
This player failed in many ways. Syncing was hit or miss. Sometimes it would skip files, sometimes it would shut down after transferring files. I had to format the player 3 times before I finally decided to return it. 
Bottom line is features, framework, software are irrelevant if the player does not perform reliably.
I have a Sony E348 now and am very happy. Looks like Creative will have to design a player that exceeds all their current standards before they win me back.

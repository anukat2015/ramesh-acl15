Title: So far it's exactly what I wanted
Content:
Bought this based strictly on Amazon reviews, which BTW I think is a great way to buy.
I've had it a week and it works great.
I have a 10x12 room with my computer and a small TV where I have my morning coffee so for the first 3-4 hours of the day I'm only heating this room. It's 28 outside today, the rest of my house is 60, and my room is a comfortable 70 with this unit on low heat (2 speed high 1500/low 750) and the thermostat set between 2 and 3 (offers 1-6).
Some have remarked that the controls are a little difficult. I used a fine tip black magic marker and highlighted the numbers and that was a good fix. You'll get a feel for the controls in a day or so anyway and now that it's set I just plug it in every morning. The cord and housing have been cool to the touch, heats well, thermostat cycles with no problem. For $20 it's a good value.

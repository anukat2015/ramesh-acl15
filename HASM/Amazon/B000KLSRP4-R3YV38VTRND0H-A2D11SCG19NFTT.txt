Title: Works in Phoenix
Content:
We use this unit to cool an un-insultated garage when it's triple digits outside. It's quite comfortable out there when this unit is set to 80 degrees. It does leak a bit of water at times but nothing to write home about as the garage is concrete and it's never more than a cup full. I highly recommend this unit.

Title: Great Gift - Could Not Be Happier
Content:
After trying the Keurig B60 coffee maker at a friends and raving about it, my dear husband surprised me with one just like it for Valentine's Day. It has been 8-months and I am "in love" with with K-Cup machine.
I use to waste more coffee, and I never got the right consistency with my drip coffee makers. After spending loads of money on expensive coffees, and several coffee makers, I finally got one I LOVE.
*Coffee is hot hot hot (which my drip maker could not match)
*The variety is excellent
*It's so easy and quick
*Perfect coffee maker for me as I am the only one that drinks coffee at home.
5 STARS AND MORE; well worth the $$

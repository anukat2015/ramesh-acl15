Title: good heater
Content:
We bought this because we know it is a reliable heater.  We chose this model over the cheaper Delonghi model, because on this one the outside fins are flat, parallel to the sides, rather than sharp.  We wouldn't want a grandchild to bump his head against sharp edges of the cheaper model.  We also like the timer feature.  It does get somewhat hot to the touch on high heat, but not enough to injure someone.  So far, so good.  We bought it in March 2008.  It works best to heat an enclosed space.  We use it to heat a family room in our basement; it takes a while but does the job.

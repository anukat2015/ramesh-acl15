Title: Honeywell HZ519 Digital Low Profile Silent Comfort Heater
Content:
This item did not work out for me. I can see where it would be useful for heating a small room, but I needed something to heat the general area where I sit (in a large room with tall ceilings). The heater is large, takes up a lot of space, and gets very hot. I was afraid to have my cats around it. Even though it seems like it put out a good amount of heat, the opening in the heater let the heat go straight up towards the ceiling. I could not feel the warm air unless standing directly above the unit. Sitting at a desk next to it did not do anything. I have since purchased a smaller unit with a fan that wil push the heat forward where I sit.  If you want to warm up a small room over a period of time, this could be for you. If you want a boost of heat in a small area of a large room, go for something else.

Title: expensive junk
Content:
The vac is fairly quiet and small, but those are about the only positive items.  It is very weak, the cord short and falls out of sockets, bad on/off switch, and blows hot air at the user. The attachments are useless and non-standard size so old ones won't fit.  I've had it less than a year and am looking for a replacement which works on my hard floors.

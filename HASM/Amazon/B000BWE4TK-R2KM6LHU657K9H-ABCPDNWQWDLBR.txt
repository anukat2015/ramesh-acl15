Title: worth it
Content:
just purchased it and it's perfect! i love the ability to control all the variables manually, while on my previous point-and-shoots, this was not possible. yes, this is my first DSLR, but i have been a photographer for quite a while and strongly reccomend this well-constructed, awesome picture quality producing camera. you can shoot in raw as well, an added benefit. if you're looking for an inexpensive yet professional camera, this camera was made for you.

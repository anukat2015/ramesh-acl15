Title: One weak link
Content:
It seems that every product has one weak link, and in the case of this coffee maker it is the way the lid is attached to the carafe. Even with gentle handling, one of the little plastic prongs broke which means the lid will no longer stay on. I have never had this problem with other coffee makers, and I have been making coffee for over 50 years.

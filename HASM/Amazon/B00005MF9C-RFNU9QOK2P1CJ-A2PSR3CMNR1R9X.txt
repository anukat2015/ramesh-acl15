Title: Great choice for single cup... Very happy (except for the burning)
Content:
I've had my Brew 'N Go for about three weeks and I am VERY happy with it. EXCEPT for how hot the coffee gets. My family prefers luke-warm coffee, and this machine makes it WAY TOO HOT. So hot that my nephew seared the taste buds off his tongue and he can no longer taste the rich flavor of Werther's Orginals Candies whice are his favorite thing to munch on at church and also at other occasions which means he is unhappy. So that is a down-side.
But I usually just will brew a cup and let it cool down for 1 hour to 1.75 hours in order to get the temp right. There should definitely be a temperature control on this device. Oh well. It's still good.
The permanent filter is easy to clean and the machine does not take that long to brew a cup (about 3.75 minutes). Also this machine is useful for making hot water. Funny story.... Last winter the pilot light on our water heater went out and our showers were so cold that it would literally knock the wind right out of you... even for my husband who is in the neighborhood of 300 pounds. This machine would have been nice for brewing hot water to take Mexican showers in. Oh well that's ok.
Overall I am impressed with this machine and I would reccommend it even to people who are not really my family, but still enjoy a good cup of luke-warm coffee. Thanks.

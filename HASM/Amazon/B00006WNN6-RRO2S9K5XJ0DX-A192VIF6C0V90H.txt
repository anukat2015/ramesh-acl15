Title: Don't Waste Your Money!!!!
Content:
I purchased this heater to use under my desk at work.  I read the reviews and most were good so I purchased this thing and I hate it!  It has an automatic shut-off and it is off more than it's on.  Just when I start to warm up the thing shuts off!  Ugh!  I should have spent a little more money, but I thought know one could really mess up a heater.  WTF!

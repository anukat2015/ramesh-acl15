Title: CZ Heater
Content:
I have been using this for about a month.  I haven't yet determined the energy savings, but I can't see how this is going to save on my electric bill, but this wouldn't be exclusive to this brand.  What it does do is keep our house warm and so far has functioned flawlessly.  The unit is quiet and puts out the heat.  I originally bought this to put in our basement since it is several degrees colder than the rest of our house.  My wife liked it so much she moved it upstairs.  I'm looking to purchase another one for the basement.  I will leave another review after I get some bills for comparison.

Title: Great camera for the enthuisiast.
Content:
I got this camera for my wife because she has an unexplored interest in photography, and she absolutely loves it.  She went from not knowing the difference between iso and aperture to being able to fine tune the camera to get the image she wanted.  The shots are far from perfect but they definitely have a beautiful professional look to them.
I work in video and film production and so i have a great appreciation for the tremendous level of control the camera gives you.  Huge iso/shutter ranges, it would be nice to have a quicker lens though.  We have figured out a majority of the controls thanks to the easily accessible manual and quick manual and good old fashioned playing around.
The best part we've found is that even without painstakingly setting manual settings the camera takes beautiful pictures on it's automatic settings.  Our real gems up to this point have come from manual settings, but that just means we have lots of room to improve.
An SDHC card is a good addition for quick read/write functionality.
This is a fantastic camera to help the photography enthuisiast or professional to create stunning photos well above it's price.

Title: Wonderful Into To DSLRs
Content:
This is a great camera, and there are a few things that I would like different, but for it's price it is highly practical. 
First off, Canon makes great products. Though the settings are not completely intuitive, once you have it down, you have it down. The review LCD is nice and large, and the viewfinder is entirely functional. I like the complexity of the menu for next level photographers who are moving into a more professional realm.
The battery life on the XTi is satisfactory. If used a lot it will need charging every few days. This is that case with digital equipment. The shutter speed, as well as the aperture size is quite versatile.
My only complaint is that the controls need to be a bit smoother and intuitive, but aside from that this is a great start. You can go to higher models, but this little canon will get the job done, very well.

Title: Cute little vacuum, works well
Content:
We waited a long time to buy this, since reviews were so mixed. We've had it now about a month and we really like it.
A few comments: The bags are incredibly difficult to find and very expensive. By accident we orderered the clinic s bags (instead of the classic) and they seem to fit fine.
As to the noise: The vacuum is very quiet until you turn on the powerhead. Then it's just as loud as any other vacuum.
Our one complaint is the "twistiness" of the wand. It's difficult to make the powerhead go where you want it. It's difficult to steer. It was a good idea to be able to vacuum under things but it doesn't quite work.
It cleans very well. We have two huge long-haired dogs and this sucks up the hair very well (in addition to all the pin feathers of our bird). One of our carpets is solid dark brown and this cleans it well. It's also very easy to take the wand out of the cannister to clean high up or in other crevises.
The unit is very light and pretty small.

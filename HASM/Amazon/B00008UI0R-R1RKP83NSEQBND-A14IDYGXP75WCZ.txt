Title: Could be designed better
Content:
Good suction as long as you empty the collection chamber and clean the filter after EVERY use, or for full suction, 1/2 way through an area. One area = 500 sq ft.
The buttons only work if I lift the hose up on the canister end after the unit is on. It has a short in the wiring running the length of the hose somewhere. 
The hose is too short. If it was 2-3 feet longer the unit would be more convenient.

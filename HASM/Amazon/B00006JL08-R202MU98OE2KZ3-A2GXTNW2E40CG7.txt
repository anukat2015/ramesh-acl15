Title: REALLY makes a difference; Worth every penny!
Content:
I have never thought coffee makers could really vary much in the coffee they produced; I thought it was more a matter or features, style and convenience of one over the other. Wrong! I really enjoy good coffee, and was never quite able to produce "coffee house" brew at home until now. The filtration and gold filter seems to really make a difference. This unit is also very sleek and attractive, not appearing large or bulky on my counter (my other concern). It is the most quiet and fast coffee maker I have ever owned, too. I can't say enough about this appliance.

Title: The shape of things to come
Content:
I actually purchased two of these cameras with the intention of using them to gather shots I couldn't get any other way - at least digitally, on a new action TV series on which I am the cinematographer. The shots from these cameras are being intercut with material recorded on an Arri D21 - a $200,000+ camera. Does the Lumix GH1 look as good? No --- but in 1080i it's more than good enough for a short action shot here and there. We have mounted it in vehicles being crashed, in a housing in an explosion and numerous other places you wouldn't put a big expensive camera and it worked great. It has even been dropped once that I know of - onto concrete and was fine. I like the camera so much I bring it home for my own use. The supplied lens is a bit slow but very very sharp. It's easy to use. I almost wish it was a bit bigger - more like my Nikon D300 but the lightness is also a plus. Panasonic needs to supply MAC based download software though. Be warned if you are a Mac user you'll need to purchase Elgato Turbo or Neoscene to properly download your HD material. Also Aperture does not recognize the RAW still files it creates but Adobe Lightroom does.  I highly recommend an Nikon ( or Canon, Zeiss etc.) adapter for it you can find on ebay so you can use fast lenses if you have them.  I can't wait for the next generation of these cameras but for now . This is IT!

Title: Even Better Than I Expected
Content:
I love this vacuum.  I wanted to write a review for others because I used the reviews that I read to help me decide on this machine.  I love all of the features like the retractable cord, the power mini tool for the furniture, the adjustable suction, but most of all I was pleasantly surprised as to how big the dirt cup was.  The only thing negative that I had read about this vacuum was that the dirt cup was small, but I found it to be a lot bigger than I expected.  I think Hoover answered all the objectives in a cannister vacuum with this model.

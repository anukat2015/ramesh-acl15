Title: Love it!!
Content:
After a few weeks of contemplation I settled on this as  my first laptop for use when I start grad school in the fall. However, I've gotten much more than I expected. The graphics are AWESOME!! It's light and quiet, the keys aren't as hard to use as I'd expected after years of desktop use...I could go on and on : )
There are a few cons- there's a few more programs loaded on it than I think I really need and like most VAIOs it gets a bit hot but generally I have no complaints!! 
I would advise that if you want something like this to get the newer model which is only $100 more- the CR420...it's processor is 2.1 GHz and it comes with 3GB of RAM....commit to Sony and enjoy : )

Title: Filter does not "filter" properly
Content:
This is a nice product except that it suffers from a serious design flaw. It has a permanent filter (one that doesn't need replacing)that does not filter properly. This results in coffee particles in your coffee. Had I know this earlier, I would not have purchased this product.

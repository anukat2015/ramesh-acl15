Title: Amazing quality and versatility
Content:
What an amazing camera! I am just now moving into amateur/hobbyist photography. My setup: Rebel XT, 1GB SanDisk CF, 28-135mm/3.5-5.6 IS Canon, and 50mm/1.8 Canon (fixed) for low-light indoors shots. After printing several vacation shots on my Canon PIXMA iP5000, I cannot tell a difference from 35mm film even after close scrutiny.
My choice was between Digital Rebel XT or Nikon D70. What sold me on the Canon was the lens selections, particularly the image stabilization feature. I concur with the other reviewers: the IS lenses are amazing. For example: outdoor night shot 1/5 sec at 100mm on ISO 400 and no tripod - NO BLUR. Don't ask me how this is possible, but it worked. I got some amazing nighttime photos of the city skyline in Nassau, Bahamas, long after the sun went down.
Things I liked:
  - phenomenal picture quality, even in very low light
  - aesthetics. yes, i'm vain...
  - fast shutter response
  - good built-in flash
  - excellent lenses (esp. 28-135mm/3.5-5.6 IS!)
  - nice menu shortcut buttons on rear panel
  - ability to shoot RAW
  - 1GB CF holds ~260 finest JPEG photos
Small complaints
  - brightest LCD setting still dark in sunlight
  - auto white balance gets it wrong once in a while
  - white balance modes are just so-so in my experience
Unless you are an extremely discriminating photography professional, I cannot imagine you would be displeased with this camera. For the money, you'll probably not find a better camera.
Happy shooting,

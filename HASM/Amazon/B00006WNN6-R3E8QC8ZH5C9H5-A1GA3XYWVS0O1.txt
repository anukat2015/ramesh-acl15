Title: I really like this heater.
Content:
This heater works well for me!  It also seems much safer than heaters I've had in the past because it is very sturdy and shuts off automatically at a certain temperature.  On extra cold days, I put it in the bathroom and warm up the bathroom before I shower.  Sometimes the heat in our house just isn't enough in every room.  If the bedroom is a little cold and I turn this on and close the door, it warms it up a lot.
I think if you are trying to heat a big space - like an open living room for example, it might not be strong enough.  It's really the type of thing you use in an office or bedroom as an additional heat source.

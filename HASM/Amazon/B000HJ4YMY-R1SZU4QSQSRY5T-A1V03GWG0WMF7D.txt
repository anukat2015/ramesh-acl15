Title: Wicked good pictures.
Content:
i bought this camera about 4 months ago for myself with the 18-55. i have shot with a d40 before and did not like the feel in my hands. the d40 feels like more of a point and shoot and the lack of autofocus points was definitely a turn off. The d200 on the other hand was out of my price range, however the d200 is wicked good camera and i would recommend that if you have some extra money. however this d80 is in the perfect price range is very comparable to the d200, while only having 2 channels instead of 4 like on the d200, the d80's images are very similar and in most cases, almost unrecognizably the same. i did my research on kenrockwell.com, dpreview.com and amazon.com and found out this camera is the one i wanted and have not had any second thoughts since. i highly recommend this camera for anyone in this price range because it is the best DSLR in this price range.

Title: Good enough
Content:
The heater looks fine. The timer and the temperature controls are easy to use. For me a Celcius display option was a nice surprise. The reason I don't give 5 stars is it does not heat as much as I was expecting. This is not a problem for me for now since I will use this to heat my bedroom during the nights to cut my gas bill but it might not be good enough if i want to use it to heat my living room say in the cold days of the fall.

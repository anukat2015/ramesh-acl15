Title: It'll do.
Content:
I chose this to replace a similar Holmes (electric coil type) heater that fell apart after several years.  In comparison to the Holmes, the Lasko:
- Outputs less instant heat on "High" (but it is sufficient).
- Has a metal grill that gets hot enough to burn you on "High."
- Has a shorter (about 7') cord.  In my situation, this is a problem.
- Does not have a built-in GFI.  If you use this is a bathroom, kitchen etc, be sure you plug it into a GFI (a.k.a. GFCI) outlet.
Once I void the warranty by replacing the short cord (not suggested unless you're a handy technician type), this will do fine.  Made in China.  Mostly plastic.

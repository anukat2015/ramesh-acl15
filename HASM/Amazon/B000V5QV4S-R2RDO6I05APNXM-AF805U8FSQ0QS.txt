Title: Locked up after 35 days
Content:
I'm sure overall this is a great camera, but I got a lemon I guess.  35 days after I received it, which is 5 days too late to return it, I got the "busy" sign of death.  Locked up, couldn't shoot, LCD is blank.  I had to mail it to Canon Factory for repair.  Hope they fix it like new!

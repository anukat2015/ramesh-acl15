Title: Amazing Little Machine
Content:
I loved the First Generation iPod Shuffle, which I bought in March 2006, but this one is even better.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with my old Shuffle, but when I saw this 2nd Gen version, I said, "I'm in!"  The only thing I didn't like about the 1st Gen was its lack of a good way to attach it to clothing, belt, etc.  I use my iPod mostly at the gym, and since I walk briskly on the treadmill, the Shuffle was always bouncing around at the end of the lanyard.  I finally found an arm band made for it...that's the other problem with the Shuffle:  lack of accessories...but after 45 minutes or so of a brisk workout, it made my arm sweat and irritated my skin.  So the addition of the clip to the 2nd Gen model made it a no-brainer for me.  And it's been worth every penny!
If you don't care about all the bells and whistles on the larger-capacity, higher-priced models, this is a great choice.  And Apple has doubled its capacity but only increased the price $10...not bad for a great little machine.

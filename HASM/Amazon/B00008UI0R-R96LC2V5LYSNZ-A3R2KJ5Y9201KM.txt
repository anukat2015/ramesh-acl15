Title: Not a year old and stopped Sucking
Content:
I got this vacuum in january of 2008. I chose this vacuum because of the great reviews. I purchased an extra fiter so i can wash one and keep one in the machine. It was great when I first got it but now it does not suck. I have to switch out the fiter everytime I use it. So I would recomend buying something with a bag if you want it to last. I am on here once again looking for a new vacuum. I was hoping this one would last because I loved it it pulls great. the power head is awsome and the bear floor attachment is big and works well. It just did not last.

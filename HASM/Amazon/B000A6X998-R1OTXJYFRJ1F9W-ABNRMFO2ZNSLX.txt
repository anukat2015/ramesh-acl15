Title: Works good, but too loud at night.
Content:
I've owned this product now for about a month.  I knew I was getting a slightly older model.  I bought it for it's features.  I was surprised at how tall this unit is in comparison to the small online picture. 
Pros:  It heats our little bedroom nicely.  The thermostat maintains the desired temperature well (so far).  It's light weight, but a bit tall for my liking.  The tip over safety feature works impressively well (so far).  It's really sensitive in that I accidentally bumped it lightly against our DVD player stand and the unit turned itself off! The power cord has an added protection feature (too tired to think!).  
Cons:  It's extremely loud at night.  Couldn't sleep for 2 nights in a row due to the noise.  I'd compare it to the distortion-like noise of a T.V. when there is no reception/input.  My wife and I woke up thinking the alarm went off really loud.  
My bottomline opinion after experiencing it for about a month:-  It's good for day time use, or until right before you hit the sack, when it's noise doesn't bother you as much.  But when you are deep asleep, it will wake anyone up - guaranteed!  If it woke me up, it'll wake anybody up!

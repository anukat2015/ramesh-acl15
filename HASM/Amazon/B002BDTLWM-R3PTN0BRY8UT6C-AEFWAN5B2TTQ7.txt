Title: Works great. Love this MP3 player for my use!
Content:
I bought the Creative Zen MX 16gb player from Costco for $[...]. It works great for the price. I use it primarily for songs but am using it for audiobooks too. I did not own the original Zen so the software and the features are all new to me.
With regards to the 2 previous reviews about it not playing media that was purchased, this player does not play DRM-protected WMAs. I downloaded DRM-protected files from my local library and it does not work...just silence so it has nothing to do with the player itself or its software.
The 16gb is plenty of space and I like the fact that this player is compatible with SDHC or SD cards so that you can expand the memory further. Also, the player is about the size of a credit card and is not bulky at all. You can put it in your breast or poants pocket with no unsightly budges. Since I've been using it for audiobooks, one of the features I like is that you can store up to 10 bookmarks (it's easy to set and retrieve a bookmark).
If you have a Blackberry, the USB cable and power adapter are 100% compatible with the player so you can either use the USB cable the player comes with or use your Blackberry's USB cable or power adapter. It's quick to charge (~3 hours to fully charge).

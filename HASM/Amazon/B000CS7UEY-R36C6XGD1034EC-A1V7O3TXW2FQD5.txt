Title: Durable and reliable
Content:
I got my Creative Zen 30 GB as a replacement for my 40 GB Zen from Best Buy.  I have had it since 2006 and through many bumps and bangs later, it still works as good as it did as when I first got it.  The battery life is excellent. I only have to charge it once every week and a half, which is great considering I use it constantly. I would recommend putting it on the quickest idle settings for longer battery life.  It has taken quite a few droppings and heavy bumps and survived with hardly a scratch.  The CD artwork and capacity for pictures is excellent for a shutterbug like me. The screen is clear and vibrant and the sync time is astonishingly quick as well as charge time.
The only cons with this is that the headphones that came with it suck. I'd say get the Skull Candy headphones from Target for it. The video quality is very pixellated and it is not as compact as some other players, so depending on what kind of pants pockets I have, I am out of luck.
All in all I would recommend this player to anyone. The cons are small but would not deter me from getting another one.

Title: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!
Content:
We purchased this heater to take the chill of our living room. In the beginning, it worked great.  We have a 2 story house and all the heat (central) used to escape upstairs but this small heater was able to maintain an even temperature in the room and thus giving the gas central heat a break.  We used it IN CONJUNCTION with our central heat.  This is not an item that can heat anything other than a small area.
We did not run it all day, only a few hours in the evening when we'd watch TV downstairs.  
What do you know... one month and a half later, it stopped working.  When we plugged it it,it started rattling like it was on its death bed then a smell of something burning came up (not actual smoke though) so we immediately unplugged it.  Waited about 15 min and started again, thinking that perhaps just something had gotten loose for a moment.  It didn't work plus that's when we noticed the fan was not running anymore.
Because it died 15 days AFTER the 30 day return policy from Amazon, we are left with this dead carcass of a heater.  We don't know what you're supposed to do with if returning is no longer available.
Overall, it did its job WHILE it lived... a mere 43 days... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, I GUESS...

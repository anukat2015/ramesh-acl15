Title: Great vacuum, couldn't be happier.
Content:
I love this new vacuum.  I was a little skeptical about the price, but upon assembly, I could tell the value was in the design and construction of the unit.  The pieces slide together easily and snap into place.  A well constructed product, to be sure.
If you hate to have a canister vacuum that bowls over when you need it to go sideways, you'll love the fact that the Miele simply slides out of the way.  It's doing a number on my dog's short hair in the carpet.
The retractable cord is nice too.  I'm one that hates to have to replug in several different sockets, so I usually pull out a utility power cord extention.
I highly recommend it, if you can affort it.

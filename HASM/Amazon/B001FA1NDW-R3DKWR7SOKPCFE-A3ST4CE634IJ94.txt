Title: Damn I love this thing!
Content:
I just needed a new mp3 player with more memory from my older 2nd generation 2GB Nano, so naturally I went with a product that I knew that would not disappoint. I was right!
Pros:
-Motion sensing is fun
-Battery is great
-Amazing photo/video quality
-If you get tired of the motion sensing, it can be turned off
-Improved sound quality
Cons:
-Earphones
-Videos, games, and too much cover flow drains battery quick

Title: Great on tile, oriental carpets, hardwood floors
Content:
I bought this to replace a similar canister.  I have three animals, and it takes care of pet hair and stray litter very easily.  I appreciate its light weight - a breeze to carry up and clean stairs. The long hose and light weight also makes it easy to get to nooks and crannys.  My only negative comment would be that it gets warm to the touch, but it doesn't seem to affect cleaning quality.  (It's not a concern; I'm not smelling anything "hot".)  I liked this so much I recently bought one for my daughter. She loves it for the same reason I do. We both agree that the carry strap makes it easy to manage.

Title: Hoover S3670 Review
Content:
UPDATE: The Power Head died on me 7 days after my Amazon "return window."  Amazon's response was to send me to the manufacturer.  Very dissapointed in the product and Amazon's response.
For the price this is a great vacuum.  The plastics are "cheap" so I'm not sure how long it will last.  
Suction: Amazing- especially on carpet- don't let your cat get too close or it's gone!  
Accessories: They supply you with all you need, but like mentioned above, very cheap plastics.
Weight:  Lightweight for stair cleaning- no problem.
I'm comparing this vacuum to our Miele Champaigne (solid vacuum with exceptionally well made parts) which is used for cleaning our living spaces.  We're using the Hoover for the garage and basement- primarily to pick up cat litter- and it does just what we're asking of it.

Title: Great for Pet Hair, Flimsy Handle.
Content:
We recently got a dog and pet hair was becoming a serious problem in our appartment. The Infinity definitly worked well on the pet hair...I didn't even have to go over spots multiple times like we did with our old vac. I don't have any complaints about the suction and it seems to do everything I need it too. 
I discoverd that by "never loose suction" the company means "you can clean the gunk out." Unlike other vacs,this one comes almost completely appart so you can clean it; and hence, keep it from getting clogged and loosing suction. Now, honestly I don't know if I'll ever do that (cleaning out the tiny compartments in a vacuum seems like work I don't want to do), but should it ever clog up it's nice that I have the option. 
My only complaint is that the extension upholstry wand is actually part of the handle, so to get the wand out you actually detach the handle from the vacuum. This is fine for ergonomics (the wand now has a giant user friendly handle) but not great when cleaning your carpet. If you pull to hard or move to quickly the want will pull out the vacuum completely (I think the latch the holds it on is just to flimsy) which is highly annoying. You have to stop and put your vacuum back together befor you can go any further...I guess to a certain extent you get what you pay for. If you don't want to pay $500 for the dyson you'll have to deal with a flimsy handle on the Infinity.

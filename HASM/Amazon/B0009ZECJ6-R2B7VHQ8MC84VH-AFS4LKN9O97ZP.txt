Title: Keep Looking
Content:
I've had this laptop for a little over a year and I wish I had saved my $1500. I've never written a review on Amazon, but after it finally croaked completely I felt obligated to.
When I first received this computer, it didn't work. I had to contact HP to order recovery disks. After running the disks the computer did run.
About a month ago, the screen would begin to go black and freeze periodically. Again, this laptop is a little over a year old. The screen issue began to be more frequent. I took it to an HP service provider. He told me the hard drive may need to be replaced ($200 parts & labor) or the mother-board would need to be replaced (approx $800 parts & labor). I went the cheaper route and guess what - it didn't fix the issue. So, since I am not forking over another $800, the laptop is junked. 
EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING

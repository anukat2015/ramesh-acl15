Title: Caused house electrical problems
Content:
After reading all the positive reviews for this space heater, I thought it would be a good choice for replacing a 5 year old Holmes radiant space heater. Boy, was I wrong. After an hour of use on the maximum settings, the heater caused the room's circuit breaker to activate. I had used my old space heater in the same outlet in the same room for years (with PC, printer, phone, modem, router and light all running at the same time) without a single problem. I returned the heater to Amazon immediately, fearing that it might cause dangerous problems in the future.

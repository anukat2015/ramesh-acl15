Title: awesome!
Content:
I love this coffee maker!  The glass insulated carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours--all day, in fact!  I accidentally broke the glass inside of the carafe so I bought the newer model.  BIG MISTAKE!!!The newer model has a stainless steel inside, not glass.  It does not keep coffee hot for very long!  If anyone knows where I can get a new carafe for the older model, do tell!

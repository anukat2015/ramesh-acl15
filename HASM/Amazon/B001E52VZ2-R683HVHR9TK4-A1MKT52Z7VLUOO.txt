Title: Small but mighty!
Content:
This is the 3rd Mighty Mite we have owned. They last about 7 years for us which include the following uses that are probably not intended by the manufacturer:
Ride-on for the kids/grandkids
Shop vac
Christmas tree needle picker-upper
Kitty litter picker-upper
Car vac
It's a great little vacuum. Doesn't take up much space. The "Boss" is EXCELLENT on hardwood floors (most of which we have), but GOOD on carpeting, because it does not have a revolving brush to get into the nap (but it will clean the surface). If you're looking for a great all-around vacuum, this is it. I'll buy another one in another 7years if they still make them :)

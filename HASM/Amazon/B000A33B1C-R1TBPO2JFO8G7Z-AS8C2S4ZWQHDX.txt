Title: Good Heater
Content:
This heater does a good job. We have a large bedroom (24 x 15) over a garage that needs supplemental heating. The design of this heater allows it to produce heat quickly and it keeps the room comfortable. The timer allows me to set it to come on in early evening and go off in the morning so it is not on while we are at work. The only thing I can think of that would make it better is if the timer allowed you to set different heat levels for different times like a programmable thermostat, but then it would probably be $80 more.

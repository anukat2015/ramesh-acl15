Title: space heater
Content:
Consumer Reports lists this as a best bargain, the rest being $70+ in price.  It says the ownly down side is the noise of the fan.  I would agree.  I don't notice the fan during the day, but I do sometime at night.  
It has two setting for power, and a knob to adjust the temperature setting. 
The smaller area between the base and the heater allows room for your hands so you can pick it up.  This makes for easy moving of the heater when it's warm and you want to relocate it.
It would be very hard to tip it over, and has all the standard safety features.  
I do wish it had a longer cord.

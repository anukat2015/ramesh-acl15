Title: I love it
Content:
I've been using it non stop since I got it.  80GB is more space than I need so it will last me a long time.  The battery life is pretty good - enough to get me through multi-stop international flights and then some.  The headphones that come with it are the best I've ever had for an mp3 player and I really like that they are magnetic so if I only want to use one I can stick it to the other instead of having it just dangle around.  I also like the radio feature, with option to select US, Europe, or Japan.  I also like the Zune Social.  It's just a nice little feature to be able to post on social networking sites and my friends and family can see what I'm listening to and get recommendations from me.
  The only things I don't like are the lack of accessories.  I everything I need but variety in docks would be nice.  The biggest complaint I have, however, is the Zune Marketplace.  The point system can be a pain.  Having to constantly convert points to dollars in my head is annoying.  It was done for compatibility with Live! but I wish they would at least give the option of paying with dollars instead of points.  Plus, you have to buy points in increments, and a lot of times you'll wind up with left over points you can't do anything with - very annoying.
  All in all, I very much like the product itself as an mp3 player.  I already bought another for a birthday gift.

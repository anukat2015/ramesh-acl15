Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
I read through all the amazon reviews before purchasing this vacuum-- so many of them seem so positive-- but let me say that I've been very disappointed with this vacuum! Yes, it works great for a few months, but, then all the electrical problems start. My vac shuts off the agitator brush while I'm vacuuming carpet. So annoying! If I jiggle the hose a little, it starts up again. So I end up pushing the handle with one hand and holding/ jiggling the hose with the other hand!  And sometimes the control panel in the handle doesn't work at all, so I have to unplug the thing to turn it off.  I'm back here at Amazon.com looking to see if others have experienced this, too, and it looks like I'm not alone. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews before I purchased this vac. So many people write their reviews after vacuuming just one time, but the best reviews come from those who've owned the product for a decent length of time. I've had mine for just over 1 year (ie, out of warranty) and am wondering what to do--- I emailed Hoover and they sent me a could of general, unhelpful recommendations, along with a list of local service centers.  When I call the service centers, one place told me that if could take weeks- a month to get the part I need... and another place even warned me that if the problem was in the hose, they'd have to check and see if that part was still available!  Wow, what a waste of money and time!    My fear is that I'm about to toss another vacuum in a landfill... but what else can you do with a piece of junk that obviously was not built to last?

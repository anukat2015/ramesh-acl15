Title: Slow to heat even a small room
Content:
I bought this last december and, new to heaters, i bought this oil filled one. After doing some research online, this was one of the more expensive heaters that's available in the target store near my place. Tried heating a living room, which was about 700 sq ft but of course, it only heats about 5 inches its radius. I have to put this as close to me as possible and still feel very cold. Use it in my room that's about 150 sq ft and was only able to warm up about 15" its radius. Decided to get a delonghi and it hits the room faster than oil filled radiator.

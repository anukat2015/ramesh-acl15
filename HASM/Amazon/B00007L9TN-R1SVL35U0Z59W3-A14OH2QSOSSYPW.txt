Title: Very dissapointed...it keeps shutting off:(
Content:
I was looking forward to buying this model after reading all the reviews but, sadly, mine doesn't work properly. It stands well over 3 feet away from everything and the unit keeps shutting off...oh well, after Christmas I will return it for a different model. It runs for 5 minutes and shuts off. I do NOT recommend this heater.

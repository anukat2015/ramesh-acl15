Title: Awesome Macbook Pro 13
Content:
This is my first real Mac also.   I must say I'm really impressed so far.  The large touch pad is great and works very very well.  Everything just runs smoother on my Mac when compared to a Vista/Win 7 Lenovo Ideapad with better specs.  I seem to be able to do more quicker with the Mac.   iPhoto is really impressive as well, I like the way you can select the persons face and it will detect it in all your pictures.   I still can't believe I paid the premium price to have a Mac, but I am glad I did.   The only fault I see with this laptop is that it will get hot if you are using it alot for photo/video work, It's not unbearable but it does get hot.   Battery life is good, not sure 7hrs, but I always have WiFi on.  I also purchased VMWare Fusion for the Mac so I can run Windows Vista or Win 7 if I need it,  I've not really seen a need to use it much but the software does a great job. 
If you are on the fence and have the $'s go for it!  This Mac is perfect size and weight to be used anywhere.   I have one other negative the min display adapter that will let you use HDMI won't send audio over the HDMI, not a huge problem but hopefully this is a software issue that will be fixed!

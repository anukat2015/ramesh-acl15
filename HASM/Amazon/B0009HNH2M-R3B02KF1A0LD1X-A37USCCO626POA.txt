Title: Not the best
Content:
After 3 months of use the vac started to fall apart. Thank God for duct tape!! The hose continuously falls out of the canister. And the hose has pulled apart from the nozzle that connects to the wand. The suction is really good only if the bag is brand new. It's heavy and bulky. If you really want to waste your hard earned money, this is the vac for you.

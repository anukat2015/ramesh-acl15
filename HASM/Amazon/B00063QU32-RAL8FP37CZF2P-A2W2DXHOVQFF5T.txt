Title: Low quality. Noisy. Avoid!
Content:
The thermostat never works. It won't turn on no matter what temperature is set. Asked Amazon for a replacement. The replacement was even worse. Thermostat was off more than 10 degrees, plus one of the towers was broken. Had to send it back for refund. The only good thing is Amazon's service.

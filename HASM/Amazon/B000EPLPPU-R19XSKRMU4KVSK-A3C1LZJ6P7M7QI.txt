Title: Poor Sound Quality. Treble set too high and damaging to eardrums
Content:
I was very disappointed with the sound quality; in fact, it seems to be hyper-tweaked for treble and base, and the two overpowering settings and opposing qualities pierce your ears. The treble is so high it actually is a bit dangerous and could increase longterm hearing damage. It is really important to consider equalizing music for clarity (keeps volume levels down) and for hearing safety. I love dance and hip hop so this shuffle is so not for me. It's price tag is also too high for being a step back from the original shuffle. I am confused? I love the size, but it doesn't hold the quality that 79$ can get you these days and I am not willing to risk my hearing on bad sound quality. Good Luck!

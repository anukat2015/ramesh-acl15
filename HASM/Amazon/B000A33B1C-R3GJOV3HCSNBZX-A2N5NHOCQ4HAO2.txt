Title: Good for smaller spaces
Content:
I have a small one bedroom place that is hard to heat. I got this in hopes that it could heat the main living room, probably 10'x20'.  I would leave it on the full 1500W setting and it was barely capable of raising the room a degree.  Now I use it just in the bedroom.  It heats the bedroom just fine, about an 8'x10' room.  It is silent which is great, and it is safe to touch, but just not powerful enough for a larger room.

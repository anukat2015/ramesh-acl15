Title: I was skeptical
Content:
My husband came home from work one day, just raving about the new Keurig single cup "blah blah blah" telling me how wonderful it was.   I hate change, and I didn't want any part of it.  I loved (liked) my regular brew, and more often than not, stopped at the local coffee house for a good cup of java 3-4 times a week. 
He surprised me with this one weekend, and after looking at the cost of the K-cups, I wasn't very happy with him.  How could a cup of coffee taste any better than what we already had going on in the kitchen.
I was so wrong, and am so happy we made the switch.  I am sure I'm putting my neighborhood coffee house out of business at this point, because I haven't been back since.  I love this, and love the variety of coffee available.  Highly recommend it!

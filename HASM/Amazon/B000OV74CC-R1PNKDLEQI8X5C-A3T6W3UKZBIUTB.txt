Title: Great Product
Content:
I have had this item for nearly one month.  It has been great.  I would defiantly recommend this product for how inexpensive it is.  I personally feel that for the price it can't be beat.  It has great music quality (unless you're a mouse you're not going to tell the difference from an ipod). I also like the ease of use with its small menu; I haven't found it difficult at all.  I also have not experienced any skipping as was stated in other feedbacks.  It is extremely easy to charge and the battery seems to last around 20 hours.  One small drawback is that the file transfer seems to work much better with Windows Media Sync rather than the drag and drop, (that is if you want the artists names and alike to match up correctly).  All and all this is a GREAT little mp3 player/jump drive to own.  Defiantly buy this rather than taking out a second mortgage to buy the latest ipod.

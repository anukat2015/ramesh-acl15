Title: Best Full-Frame Camera: Don't drink Nikon Cool-Aid just yet
Content:
In real world and in the studio, I'm shocked at the image quality difference from my old 5D I bought 4 years ago.  I'm kicking myself for not buying this earlier.  Color fidelity, contrast, sharpness, color balance, focusing all better.  I'm surprised that the extra resolution really did help.  The large files have a lot of headroom for mistakes.  
While most reviews for this type of item are rationalizing a large purchase, here it goes anyway.  When I first purchased the camera, I had cold feet and was ready to return because of the price.  But after 2 months, I would buy it again even if I broke it.
Alternatives are really overrated.  Nikon has a far more aggressive marketing team than in the past that exaggerates differences, so take what you read with a grain of salt.  Lots of people are drinking Nikon Kool-Aid right now and defend them to the death.  Overall Canon is a better SYSTEM, although I openly admit things I like better about Nikon: button layout, viewfinder, body design, built in infrared flash control, built in flash, and the 14-24mm lens.  But other things: low resolution alternatives, poor third party support (pocketwizard and adobe raw), overprices lenses with no midprice alternatives, poor video or no video, etc.  For instance, Canon makes a 17-40L for much less than the 16-35L.  A 70-200 4 IS or no IS, 70-200 2.8 IS or no IS.  Nikon only makes the expensive versions, which is why I always see Nikon owners with cheap lenses or mid-prices Sigma Lenses.  Canon owners almost always have Canon lenses.  Anyway:
Pros:
-Outrageous RAW headroom for mistakes, far beyond the 5Dmk1.  In outdoor portraits with strobes, I can still get a high quality images when the strobes don't fire and leave me with a -2ev shot.  When making outrageous changes in Photoshop, files respond beautifully.  RAW files are monstrous, however.
- Picture quality out of camera saves serious time in photoshop.  
- The screen is finally useful in judging exposure.  You can clearly see if the skin tones are over and under exposed, hotspots in a poor lighting setup, etc.  You'll still see more detail in shadows on the computer, however.
- ISO sensitivity: one of the best today.  I shot out of a car window at twilight in a spooky looking town and got amazing shots at 6400+.  I shoot more for fun since I've had this camera.
-Great customization and cool menu controls.
-I laughed at video but am starting to use it regularly at weddings.  Amazing quality of expensive video cameras.  Tricky to learn with autofocus.  Must use a tripod.
- Even more detail out of my lenses (except 100-400)
- Everything improved from old 5D
- Much better image quality than 1Ds Mkii and iii.
- Canon lenses a much better value than Nikon.
Cons
- MINUS ONE STAR - second position of power switch was broke when arrived, so I couldn't use any manual features.  Had to order a new one.
-Pre-planned obsolescence; just look at the 7D with built in speedlight control, extra video switch, auto-focus system, pitch-leveler, 1.0 viewfilder, etc.  The sensor on this thing is still WAY better, and I needed another camera body now.  But, it has features such as video that are way ahead of the competition.
- File size is getting ludicrous, especially when you need to export to TIFF, but WORTH IT.  Unlike 7D and others, however, that extra file size actually has way more detail.  Other high MP cameras can't justify their file sizes.  sRaw not much smaller.
-My 100-400mm L Canon lens cannot keep up with this high mp, full frame camera.  Your worst glass will look REALLY BAD  with this camera.  Even sigma lenses look better.  Looks much better on an APS-C.
-I still sometimes miss the focusing system on my old 20D.  Maybe I'll buy a 7D for bird shooting.  People really exaggerate the differences in focusing systems, but it honestly could use improvement.
-Viewfinder not as good as Nikon's or Canon 7D.
Notes: shoots with 17-40 4L, 24-70 2.8L, 70-200mm 2.8 IS L, 100-400mm L, Lensbaby, Sigma 12-24mm fullframe,

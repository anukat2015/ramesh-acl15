Title: Do Not Buy
Content:
I have never written a product review but felt compelled to write one after just pitching Grind and Brew into the garbage after 1 1/2 miserable years of use. 
I've had more overflows due to the coffee grind basket popping out during the brewing cycle or the lid on the coffee maker not allowing the brewed coffee to drain into the carafe.  I've had coffee all over my counter and seeping down the counter behind the refrigerator.  In short, I've had to babysit this coffee maker constantly and when I don't watch it brewing, I regret it with a mess on my hands.  
The grinder was so loud(by the way it broke completely about 6 months ago forcing me to buy and use a separate grinder) that I would actually cover up the coffee maker with towels to dampen the noise so not to wake up the kids.
It is a pain to clean with many parts to wash up after use. 
Also, I found I needed to heat the carafe with hot water in order to get hot coffee otherwise the coffee was warm but not hot.  
Lastly, the royal sin - it makes some of the worst coffee I've ever tasted.  
I'm going out to buy a new coffeemaker and I'm looking forward to using tomorrow morning.
You can do better to find another coffee maker.

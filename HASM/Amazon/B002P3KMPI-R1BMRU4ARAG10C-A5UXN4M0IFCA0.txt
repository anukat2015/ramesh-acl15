Title: Very Good Laptop
Content:
My Rating: 4 1/2 Stars.
Pros: A mobile laptop.  Light weight.   Great Screen LED is Nice.   Full keyboard although its a 15"er. Modern CPU that gives you enough speed without sucking all the juice of the battery. Gets you 5+ hours . Discrete Graphics Card. 4 GB of DDR 3. Runs some games. Not Cluttered with 3rd Party Software. Asus programs are helpful. Windows 7 is better that Vista ! Claims to have a 2 year warranty.
Cons: 1) Integrated Mouse Button is bad. Its a stiff button. 2) It doesn't bother me but I could see other picky people be bothered by the Gloss finish; it does get smudgy easily. 
Overall I like this computer. Hardware wise its worth every cent. It was exactly what I was looking for with the right price. I probably changed laptops every 6 months for the past 2 years because I couldn't find a good fit for me. This one might be the laptop I will stay with for a while. It sucks that Asus got everything right except the mouse and the gloss finish, in my opinion.

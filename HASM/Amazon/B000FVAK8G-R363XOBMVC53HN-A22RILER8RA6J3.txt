Title: So far---So good
Content:
Mine hasn't shut off on its own like others mention here.  Mine came from Target and it is still new though.  The thermostat has a +/- 2 degree offset.  So if I set it to 70, it will run till the area is 72 before it turns off and then it will wait till the area is 68 before it turns back on.  This is good so the unit isn't constantly going on and off to maintain an exact temperature.  Other reviewers haven't mentioned this.  Is this how others are also?

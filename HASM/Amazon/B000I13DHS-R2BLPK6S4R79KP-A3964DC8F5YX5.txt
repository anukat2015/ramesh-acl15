Title: Warm and quiet!
Content:
I bought this fan to put under my desk because my office is freezing in the winter!  It never gets too hot, it's quiet and after it's been on for 10 or 20 minutes, the whole room feels warm.  My office is pretty small.  I've used the heater fan in my living room and found it isn't as efficient in large rooms.

Title: Very Quiet
Content:
I'm was surprised to find that this unit does not have a thermostat or power level settings, like the Holmes heater that it replaced after 5+ years of use. The new unit is extremely quiet and heats space very quickly. Only time will tell how energy efficient the unit is, but this unit does not dim the lights like the old unit when in use. So it appears it's energy usage is less. So far, I would say that these are great space heaters.

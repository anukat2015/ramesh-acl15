Title: Good Camera, Good Service
Content:
This is a good camera. I have the film version of this Canon, auto-focus, a couple lenses.. & decided to upgrade myself to the digital.. so I ordered the body only, hoping that the old lenses I got will still work on this digital version, AND IT WORKS JUST FINE!, auto-focus & everything, as promised by Canon. Good for semi-pro to professional photodudes. Get a good separate flash.. otherwise, the battery will not last long. Better yet, order an extra battery.. I did. You can get it for less at Staples for 20 bucks. The service from amazon.com is very good.. delivered as promised, no glitz.

Title: No CF card included
Content:
Nice product, great price, but does not come with a CF card. So no, you can not use it right out of the box, unless you happen to have a CF card on hand. I recommend you buy one through Amazon, along with the camera, so you will not have to drive down to the local mall to get one.
This annoyance can be easily prevented by Canon by including one with the camera.

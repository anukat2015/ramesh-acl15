Title: Delonghi TRD0715T heater
Content:
I bought the Delonghi heater last winter and this winter it has started making noise on the 2 & 3 settings. Perhaps it's not 'drive you crazy' loud but, who knows, perhaps it'll get worse and it is disappointing.  I'm considering moving it out of the bedroom and getting different heater for that space.  Beyond that it's definitely not a quick way to heat up a room but, on the plus side, if we just turn it on a little while before going to bed then we're comfortable through the night and can keep our furnace turned way down.  Also, it seems solidly constructed and hasn't given us any cause for concern about its safety.  So, really, it's been quite good but I just might consider getting something else as our second space heater because of the noise issue, but it's definitely a possibility that I'll just get another one of these.

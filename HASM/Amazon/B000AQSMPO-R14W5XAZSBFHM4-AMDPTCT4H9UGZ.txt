Title: Keurig v. Tassimo. I have both.
Content:
The Keurig B60 beats the Tassimo in all categories. I bought the Keurig for the home and we have a Tassimo at the office. Keurig pros...leave on all the time..it's ready to use, I can find coffee at my local Bed, Bath and Beyond and Target easily, you can use the hot water w/o the inserts for hot cereal, hot tea of my own choosing, oatmeal, etc for the kids...would buy it again almost for that one reason alone.
Cons against Tassimo..hard to find coffee and only one tea option, instructions say to turn it off when not in use, therefore, it takes longer to warm up and get ready, loud, and won't allow you to use hot water w/o a pod.
As soon as economy turns around, I'll send the Tassimo to Salvation Army and buy a Keurig for the office as well.

Title: Happy Customer
Content:
My old 13-inch Macbook with 120-GB hard drive + 1-GB RAM + Core 2 Duo, had cost me ~$1500 in 2007 but then had a hard drive failure after just two and a half years. I decided not to flush my good money down Job's pocket any more.
Got this machine for Core i7 + 6 GB RAM + NVidia graphics card w/ 1 GB memory a couple of weeks ago. I have been pretty happy with its overall performance and even Windows 7.
I did notice from the very beginning the incessant hissing noise everybody is talking about. It was not loud but maddening (to me).
But I found a fix at a Yahoo forum: Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Sound -> "Recording" tab -> Select "Microphone" in the list and click on the "Properties" button -> "Listen" tab -> Check "Listen to this device" and select "Digital Output(Optical)..." from "Playback through this device:" drop-down.
It hisses no more.
The fan sound isn't bad at all. My old Macbook made far louder noise every time it got hot, which was about every hour or so.
It doesn't get hot like my old Macbook, either (boy, did that thing get toasty).
The DVD-RW/Blue-Ray-R drive runs pretty smoothly. My old Macbook used to vibrate violently when I tried to burn a CD at 4x or faster.
In short, it is pretty good, and I would recommend it to my friends and family. A little pricey, generally speaking, but a bargain compared to the overpriced Apple things.

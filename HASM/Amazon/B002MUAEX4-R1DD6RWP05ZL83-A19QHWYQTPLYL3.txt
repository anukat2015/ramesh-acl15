Title: Big step in right direction but still not quite there
Content:
Dpreview has an excellent review of the GF1 and I won't elaborate on their technical assessment.
I'll focus on the usability of the camera, for me.
I've owned about a dozen film and digital cameras, including compacts and SLRs of both types, and like many camera enthusiasts I've long wanted the image quality of an SLR in a compact size.  The GF1 is a big step in the right direction, a very fun camera to use, but it just doesn't quite meet my hopes for portability - the camera + pancake lens still are just a tad too big to comfortably fit in a large pants pocket.  For me this is supposed to be the main appeal of micro four thirds cameras - smaller than SLR isn't good enough, it has to be small enough so that you always take it with you without hesitation.  The whole point of this camera is its compact size, and if you are going to have it dangling around your neck and bouncing around, or tucked into a case or backpack to keep it out of the way, you might as well save a few bucks and get a cheap SLR with comparable image quality.  (I know Panasonic offers the excellent LX3 for true portability).
One other minor gripe: there is almost no grip on the camera so I found it a little harder to solidly hold than I would have expected, given its light weight.  A larger grip wouldn't have added any to the overall size since the lens still protrudes far more.
Anyhow I still love the camera and especially the super-fast pancake lens - I am enjoying the lack of zoom, forcing me to think a little more about composition.  And, it does fit well in a jacket pocket, so is certainly a big improvement in portability over an SLR.
Recommendations for a full kit:
- UV filter to protect your $400 lens
- Lens Cap keeper so you don't lose the cap
- Wrist strap - toss the enclosed neck strap - if you are going to hang a camera around your neck you might as well get an SLR.  This camera is light enough that you can tether it to your wrist
- Small bag or case
- 8GB or larger card - 1 min of high-res video eats up about 250M
- Spare battery (optional - battery life is excellent)
Wish-list for Panasonic development team:
- a few more fixed length, fast, compact (pancake) lenses - maybe start with 24mm & 80mm (35mm equiv.) to go with the current, excellent 40mm (35mm equiv).  Given that the average GF1 buyer is probably very interested in its small size, killing that advantage with a long zoom lens seems pretty pointless.  
- make the GF2 even smaller - goal is to have lens + camera that can fit in a large pants pocket
- articulated screen would be a nice bonus
- better grip

Title: Powerful and fast little computer
Content:
I was worried that the UL20A would not have the power or be fast enough but it has been great.I have it attached to a monitor when not traveling and it powers it fine.  It is every bit as fast as the larger laptop I had and much more convenient to travel with.  The service I received from Mobile Advance who shipped this computer was fantastic.  They were very supportive in helping me decide which of the Asus computers to purchase and responded to my requests.

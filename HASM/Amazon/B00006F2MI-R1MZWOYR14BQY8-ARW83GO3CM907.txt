Title: Too much trouble
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker in preparation for a kitchen renovation.  I had never owned an automatic coffee maker before and I always ground my own beans, so this seemed like a good choice.  Truly, it was a mistake.  First of all, the coffee was never hot enough when it was brewed.  As a result, I had to boil water first so that it would be hot enough when brewed.  Simply heating the inside of the carafe with hot water was not enough.  Even then, the coffee was never really very hot.  When the paper filter in the filter chamber was the tiniest bit askew, the coffee would flood out onto the counter.  To solve this, I used a gold filter with a paper filter inside.  The coffee was OK, but each day I had to wash the carafe and lid, the filter holder, the filter holder lid, the gold filter insert, and both parts of  where the beans are placed to be ground.  With my renovation beginning, and the only place to wash things being the bathroom sink or the basement laundry room sink, I gave up on this and bought a Keurig that has nothing to wash and for which I have read almost uniformly good reviews.  We'll see how that goes, but this one is going down to the basement until I figure out what to do with it.

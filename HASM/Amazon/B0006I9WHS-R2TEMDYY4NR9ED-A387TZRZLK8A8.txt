Title: 3 Honeywells, 3 horrible experiences
Content:
This heater was the best of my 3 experiences with Honeywell.  The heater actually worked for almost a year before dying.  Below is my review of my Honeywell experiences:
Honeywell HZ2800BW Turbo Heater Fan
Enough is enough.  I bought this heater and it failed within two weeks.  When it fails, the light will come on but neither the heating element or the fan will work. Thankfully Amazon is awesome at returning products and they had another one in the mail before I even put this one in the mail to ship it back.  The new one arrived and it ran for about a month before stopping.  When it failed it failed in the same way as the first one.  Since it was Spring, I just threw it away and took the loss.  
Convinced that it must have just been a defective model of Honeywell, I ordered the HZ-315 Quick Heat Ceramic Heater.  This one actually worked for almost one whole year before dying last night in the exact way the other two did.  The moral to the story is this:  Honeywell heaters are garbage.  Unfortunately, I begin this whole Honeywell nightmare only after my Holmes heater died after 5+ years of it running night and day during the winter.  SPEND THE EXTRA FEW DOLLARS AND BUY QUALITY WHICH IS NOT HONEYWELL.

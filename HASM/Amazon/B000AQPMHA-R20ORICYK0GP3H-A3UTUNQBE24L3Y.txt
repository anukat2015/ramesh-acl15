Title: Fantastic Product w/ Great Customer Service
Content:
I bought the B40 at Christmas time and it makes the best coffee ever. I've been a loyal Bunn user for 20 years and I have to say that this beat the Bunn hands down! The coffee is just full-bodied, hot and ready in an instant. In early March, it wouldn't power on. I called Keurig at 10:45pm (and they are in!) and within 5 minutes, the CSR said she would send out a brand new unit...they didn't require any paperwork, proof of purchase or return of the old unit! I received a shipping notification 1 hour later and received the replacement in 2 days! I love companies who stand by their product and do the right thing by their customers! You will not be disappointed with this coffee and if you are unfortunate enough to get a model that isn't working properly (there are several people who have had problems with theirs), you can count on Keurig to stand behind their product.

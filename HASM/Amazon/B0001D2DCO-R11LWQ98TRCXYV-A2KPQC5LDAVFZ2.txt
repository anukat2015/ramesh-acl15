Title: Makes a huge difference
Content:
I have had my Pinguino for a couple of years now and it was a great buy. At the time I did a fair bit of research in looking for a portable air conditioner for a house I was renting. In the end I bought a Pinguino and I'm really happy I did. 
Yesterday was the 4th hot day in a row. It was 39 degree Celsius outside, 32 in most of the house. However, the room with the Pinguino didn't get above 27.

Title: Very Happy - and a Built-In FM Tuner!
Content:
I'm very happy with my 8GB Zune.  The fact that it has a built-in FM tuner gives it a big edge over the Nano, which requires an extra add-on piece of hardware for FM.  The FM tuner is excellent and gives the station genre, song name, and artist name.  My daughter has a 4GB Nano and she's jealous because I got my 8GB Zune for less money and it does more.

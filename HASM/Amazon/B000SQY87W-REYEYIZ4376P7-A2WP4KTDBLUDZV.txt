Title: Received 2 broken units
Content:
Received this air conditioner as a gift early last summer for my then 6 month old daugter's room. It worked for about 2 months before it just stopped working. No air, no lights, no nothing. Had to spend over $100 to ship it back to "Air & Water", not to mention having to lug it to the shipping center. They finally sent a replacement 3 months later. Just went to hook it up, and the exhaust fan isn't working!!! It will blow cold air for about 40 sec, then hot air. WORST EXPERIENCE WITH ANY PRODUCT EVER!

Title: Ignore the bad reviews by clowns
Content:
Excellent coffee.  Cleaning is no big deal and does NOT need to be done every time.  My favorite negative reviewers are the morons who complain that it makes &quot;weak&quot; coffee, as if the machine could possibly have anything to do with the strength of the coffee -- a factor determined purely by the ratio of the coffee beans to water.

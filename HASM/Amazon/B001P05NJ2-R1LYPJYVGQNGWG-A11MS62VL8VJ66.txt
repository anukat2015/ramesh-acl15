Title: Nearly flawless!
Content:
This laptop is a thing of beauty.  You have to hold it to understand how well it is built and how smoothly it runs.  I have seen no performance lag.  The price to upgrade from the base model to the 2.53GHz model is worth it for the extra components.  Definitely a better LED screen than the new Macbook.  Suprisingly light for its size and feels just as expensive as it is.  The only complaint I have is the battery life seems to be less than the 5 hours advertised.  I turned bluetooth off and set the brightness at a minimum and barely get over 4 hours using the lower end graphics setting.  Still, a quality computer from a quality company.

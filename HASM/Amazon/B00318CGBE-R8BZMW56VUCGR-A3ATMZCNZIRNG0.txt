Title: Great machine for the money!
Content:
I hadn't bought a new computer in almost 10 years.  I chose Compaq because of that - my old workhorse (still functioning) is a Compaq!  This laptop is a basic model, but works fine for the purposes for which I bought it.  My only complaint is that the battery life is not as advertised, but I seldom take it anywhere that I can't plug it in.

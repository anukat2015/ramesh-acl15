Title: HEPA aside, it's not bad
Content:
I purchased this product after checking reviews on a few sites and after having had a Bissell upright for 10 years (I loved that one!). I want vacuums with bags and this was one of the few on the market that was reasonably priced. That said, the product is lighter weight than my old one and lighter than the Hoover bagless I tried (bleh!). I have had this vacuum for 8 months and I just replaced the belt and I was happy that it was a repair I could do myself. The motorized floor brush is a little light and I find I have to make more than one pass over an area to see it clean (I have white pet hair on a cranberry-colored area rug, so I can tell. I agree that the HEPA claims may be a stretch, but then again I didn't buy the vacuum for that. I also think that the bags are small, so you go through them more quickly, which is a shame. But if you are looking at this product because you want light-weight, you have to make some concessions. Overall, I am ok with this product. Is it the best one on the market? Probably not, but for the price it has been working well for me.

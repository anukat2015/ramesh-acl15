Title: The best bargain in 35mm photography
Content:
The N90s (F90x everywhere but the US) has been my main film camera for journalism work in the former USSR since 2005.  It is outstanding in every way, and is a bargain at its current market value.  The meter is superb, and typically does not over- or under-expose.  (My FA overexposes with backlit subjects.)  The N90s is tough, weather-sealed, but not too heavy.  It feels great when handling it and is almost infinitely adjustable, with a number of settings for flash (such as back or front flash), burst speed, focus, etc.  The only issue with the camera is that the back rubberized armor begins to delaminate if you use the camera a lot.  I'd recommend it unhesitatingly if you need a cheap but superb semi-pro 35mm camera.  (By the way, the Amazon illustration seems to be a D90, not an N90s/F90x.)

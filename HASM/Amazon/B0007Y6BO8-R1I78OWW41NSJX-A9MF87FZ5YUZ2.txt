Title: Adds Plastic Taste to Coffee
Content:
This coffeemaker has to be carcinogenic. It adds a strong taste of plastic to  the coffee. Most coffeemakers have plastic parts but they do not add a direct plastic taste to the coffee. Also, as the coffee brews, a distinct plastic aroma wafts from the coffeemaker into the room.  
I am amazed that Krups, a reputable firm, would not realize while evaluating this product, that the plastic was directly leaching into the liquid in the coffeemaker. It is not good if they poison their clientele.
Do NOT buy this unless you like your coffee flavored with plastic resins.

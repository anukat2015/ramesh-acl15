Title: Best in its class - Almost!
Content:
Very happy with this camera. It has just about all the features you could want; In-body Image Stabilization, Oly's proven dust reduction system, large view screen, live view, 10mp sensor, good performance at high ISO etc etc.
Perhaps the only issue at present is that the white balance can sometimes be off on some images... not all. Hopefully this will be fixed soon in a firmware update?
Apart from this, Olympus definitely have the best digital lenses of any brand and this camer has taken some awesome photos for me. I would buy another over the competing Canon and Nikon cameras in the same price range!

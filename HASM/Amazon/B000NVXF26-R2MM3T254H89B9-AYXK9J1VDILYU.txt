Title: I love this camera!
Content:
I bought this camera a little over a month ago and I love it. I am a beginner with SLR but have enjoyed digital photography for years. While I still have a lot to learn about all the settings and features, I have been able to take some amazing pictures using the auto settings alone. Great camera for those who are interested in getting into SLR photography. And great price as well.

Title: Great Value
Content:
I have had this mp3 player for six months now (I bought it in July), and it is still in my top three favorite purchases.  I have my entire CD and mp3 collection on it, but only a fraction of the space has been used.  I use my jukebox daily in my car (I have an input jack built in), and it has worked perfectly since day one.  I, like other reviewers, have never had (or even used) an iPod, but I definitely think this little machine is worth every penny.

Title: great laptop for a specific need
Content:
Others have already covered the specs and what this laptop comes with so I will not waste your time with it all over again. I have had this for about a week now and all I can say is for the use I have this is a great laptop. 
Let me start by saying that this laptop is for the user that needs a long battery life and moderate usage. What is moderate you may ask. Well my definition is if you email, surf, work in MS office, watch movies, listen to music and even play a few older games then this will work for you. I do all these things and a few more.  So far this computer has lived up to all the advertisements and even plays games at pretty decent level. I have tried older games like battlefield 2 and it runs great on it. 
My list of positives:
Great battery life, screen quality, light weight, runs all my current software with no issues internet connection.
Negatives: 
Keyboard, speakers.
I have to say a few words about the negatives; they could make the keyboard a little better so it has a bit of grip to it. As for the speakers they are not very loud but this is a small computer and really I think there is no really good way to add them and keep the size and sleekness.  
Bottom line is if you want to have a long life battery, portability with the lightest weight then this is for you. What it is not is a gaming machine or a super power laptop. If you want power then this is not for you. If you like to hit the coffee shop and do just about everything but high-end graphics then you have found a great computer. One other note this works just fine for the graphic designer. I have Adobe Creative Suite 3 installed and I am very pleased with the operation.

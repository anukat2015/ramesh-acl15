Title: TOO SLOWWWW!
Content:
As you had Known Windows Vista is the worst OS ever, some laptop works well enough with it, but the rest really not. And this is not one of them, The only two reasons for me to buy this laptop were the huge battery duration and the option to receive a brand new copy of Windows 7. 
This copy hasn't arrive, i will wait for it to install it and then see if all the problems has gone or still remain.

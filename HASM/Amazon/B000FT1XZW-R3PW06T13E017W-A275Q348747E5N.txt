Title: Give it some time and it'll get the job done
Content:
As my title states this thing does take a little bit of time to start warming up the place.  For an average room I would say 15-30 in a mildly chilly room to get comfortable. It gets hot right away, but it is radiant heat without a fan so the heat will travel up and begin slowly heating your room from the top down.  Like everyone here I had that oil smell, and it took way longer (2x longer in my case) than the recommended time to burn off completely.  ComforTemp (which is suppose to keep your room temperature optimal) for me was like overdrive on this thing, meaning this thing got extremely hot.  I don't really have a use for it.  Yes this thing does get hot to the touch, but what heating unit doesn't?  Be careful with the back, because it does run hot.
CONS
-The Thermostat isn't a "real" thermostat.  It is just a number 1-6.  I always leave it on 6 and turn off the heater when it gets warm (never think it's a good idea to leave a heater on unattended even if it does have a timer/thermostat).  So this is not a big deal to me, but maybe it is for some.
-The design of the front area makes this thing a little front heavy.  It's relatively easy to knock this thing over if you're not careful.  (note* this is with the wheels locked out.  If they are locked it, it sort of helps to remedy the problem.)
PROS
-Quiet
-Uses a flip switch (yes this is important for me, because they are less prone to breakage.  I had button switch units prior to this, and over an extended time the button switch always seems to fail.
-3 Voltage Settings
-Very good value for the price.
-Radiant Heat, so your room does not get that "dry" like other heaters.
I am overall satisfied with this product and would recommend it to a friend.

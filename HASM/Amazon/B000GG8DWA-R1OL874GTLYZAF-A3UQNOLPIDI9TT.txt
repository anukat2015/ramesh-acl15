Title: I like it, but.....
Content:
Just got 3 of these and haven't used them for long, but I'm generally satisfied. Throws off a fair amount of heat at the low setting; at the 800 watt setting it feels like it produces much more heat than my 1500 watt heater. I'd rate it higher except that: There's no thermostat. Assembly construction is sloppy; the plastic case is OK but the metal components don't line up, especially the grill which is not very secure and does little for safety considering how hot it gets. The grill keeps things from contacting the tubes and that's all. I was surprised how easily it comes off when I tried to straighten it. The point is I'd be very, very careful with this unit around kids or pets. Considering how hot it gets I'd think twice before using it under a desk or some other confined space. Given the criticisms, I think it's a bit overpriced. I do like that: It's quiet since there's no fan, seems to produce as much heat as units using twice the wattage, has hooks on the back for storing the cord, and the overall design doesn't look bad in a room.

Title: piece of junk
Content:
Garbage??? I purchase one for my house and was impressed with it's suction so I got one for my mother. Less than two years later neither one is working. I find them to be trash. The first thing that happens is the battery only lasts for a minute or maybe two and then it stops working altogether. We only used them on average about 15 to 20 minutes each week????
Just wish they had a better warranty. The last black and decker we had lasted for many years but had bad results with one of those also and switched to this one because of all the rave reviews on amazon. I don't think to many people come back and write reviews after a year of use? But I am so angry at the crap people sell today I took the time.

Title: Don't waste your $$$!!!!!!!!
Content:
This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned.  I am searching for a new vacuum after owning this one for only 4 months.  I do not have pets, but do have 4 young children so I have to vacuum pretty much daily.  Problems include: 1) the cord is attached near the bottom of the handle in the back of the vacuum so you are constantly stepping on it and getting tangled up no matter what tricks you try, 2) the suction hose constantly pops out of its holder so the vacuum stops picking up much of anything; you usually continue vacuuming for awhile until you realize nothing has been getting picked up so you have to shove the hose back in and re-vacuum  3) you have to empty it constantly if you have any chance of it working, 4) the "extension" hose is a joke as it is so short you feel like you have a vacuum cleaner looking over your shoulder the whole time you are trying to vacuum your floors, and 5) the power switch is inconveniently located next to the handle release so you quite often release the handle and bonk yourself when trying to turn the vacuum on.  UGH!!!!!!!  I hope this review saves someone from the frustrating vacuum experience I've had with the Dirt Devil Reaction!

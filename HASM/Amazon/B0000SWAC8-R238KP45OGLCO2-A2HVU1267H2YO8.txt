Title: I hope this is better than the previous model
Content:
I actually bought an EL7001.  A 2-cent clip that joins the power head to the wand broke off, and we tried an Electrolux store for repairs.  They told us "Oh, we don't handle those--they're made by Eureka.  If you want a REAL Electrolux, bring it in for a trade-in."  Now, would you buy anything from idiots like that??  The vacuum is now worthless, because the power head won't stay on.  One star is more than they're worth.

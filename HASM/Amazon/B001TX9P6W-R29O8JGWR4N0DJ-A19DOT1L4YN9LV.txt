Title: Great camera
Content:
I selected the E-620 for all of the 5-star good reasons mentioned so far but most importantly because it has a very wide dynamic range, even compared to DSLRs at twice the cost.  Dynamic range is my hot button, and this camera has it.  I photograph high end coastal real estate, and it's often a challenge to get a nice bright sunny day ocean view shot from inside the residence through a window and still have the interior look nice.  It's hassle to screw around with lighting and Photoshop to get a decent shot under those demanding conditions.  The E-620 has made that task far easier with its great dynamic range.  I would say that this is my number one feature. However, I love all the other features too such as a very functional live view with a bright display that can actually be used outside in bright sun.
This is my first Olympus camera, and I'm warming up real fast to the brand.

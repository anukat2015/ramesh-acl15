Title: Good Gadget...wish I had purchased the 16GB
Content:
I am happy with the purchase of my ipod itouch. I currently own a nano, ipod classic, and a shuffle. I would reccommend that you buy the larger 16GB model if you are one to watch movies or tv shows. The 8 GB gets used up fairly quickly. Because I own the other ipod models I use those for music and the itouch for video. I am pleased and would recommend this for video watchers who are not going to put this to hard use as the device is really not for on-the-go usage that is "rough and tumble". Just being honest here...but again i am happy with the purchase.

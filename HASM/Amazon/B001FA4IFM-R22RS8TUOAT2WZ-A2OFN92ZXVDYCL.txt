Title: Quality Issues
Content:
I purchased this heater in late 2008 and used it infrequently (15 times a month for less than an hour each time) to pre-warm a 7' x 10' bathroom.  It ran quietly but the thermostat was not very accurate.  The heater would sometimes shut itself off after 10 or 15 minutes and then have to be reset.  Now, in January, 2010, it has stopped working entirely and I have just thrown it out!  A shame because the looks of it and the quietness of it made it a nice solution to what seemed to be a simple job for it.....but it just didn't perform well or for very long.

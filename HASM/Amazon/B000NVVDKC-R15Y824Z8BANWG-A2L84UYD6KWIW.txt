Title: Olympus Evolt E-510 Images Too Dark and WB Off
Content:
I bought the Olympus Evolt E-510 based on reading the glowing reviews and based on its feature set.  I took a bunch of pictures indoors over the holidays and found the pictures waaayyyy too dark.  I'm not a photography expert, so I typically use the automatic settings.  I tried all types of ways to brighten up the picture but nothing I did solved the problem.  My Canon Point-And-Shot SD550 took much better pictures!  I thought it might be the built in flash, so I went and got the top of the line Olympus Flash FL-50 and although the flash is cool, I still got dark pictures.  
The other issue that I found was the White Balance (WB) seemed to be off with more than a few pictures.  The colors were too warm and I had to play a lot in iPhoto to get the pictures even close to an acceptable level.  I purchased a digital SLR for its increased speed and for its better picture quality, but the Olympus Evolt E-510 did not come close to the image quality that I would expect from a $700+ camera (with the lenses).
I returned both the camera and the flash and I ordered the Nikon D80 based on its positive reviews and based on advice from a neighbor, who is into photography.  After returning the Evolt E-510 I read the new Amazon review and it did point out it's low exposure and WB issue with the automatic settings.  
If you like to use the automatic settings of the camera, then my advice is to stay away from this camera.

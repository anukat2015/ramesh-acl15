Title: Nikon, as usual, yes. Amazon prices, NO.
Content:
I am quite pleased with the camera. After all , it is Nikon. I have had various Nikons since 1973. The delivery was quick and easy. However, a few days after I purchased the camera, I saw the same camera (and additional lens) is being sold for a whopping $ 215.00 less. So, buy the camera but not from the Amazon stores.Nikon D40x 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens

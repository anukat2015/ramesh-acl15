Title: Great, not Excellent
Content:
This is my first mac to own, and i must say; it's an overwhelming experience, the OS is just a breeze to learn and the touch pad is so fun to use that you eventually hate using anything else besides it.
The Machine is quite, worked smoothly with no glitches to mention so far. I currently use it for video editing and graphics creation and it didn't let me down just yet. the build is solid and rigid, and it looks awesome.
The only downside is the fact that you're stuck with only 2 USB ports I usually connect a WACOM tablet to the thing and that uses one. and one USB port these days wont do you good.
I must say this thing performs like a champ. If you really value peace of mind, simplicity and powerful performance get this baby or you can check out the newer lineup released by Apple recently.

Title: Nearly perfect!
Content:
The WindTunnel is a great vacuum.  It's studily made, and everything fits together with a satisfactory click.  The suction control has 3 settings:  normal, higher, and suck-grandma's-teeth-out-from-the-vent (How did they get down there anyway?)
We have beauttiful hardwood floors, and it works like a dream sucking dust from every crevice.  We also have a fair number of small area rugs (3x5 or 2x6), and these are more of a challenge.  Even on normal suction, this vacuum can pull a loose thread from these small rugs, can create a tangle while also unraveling quite a bit of rug.  (These are cheap Target rugs that we throw down to protect the floors from the ravages of our dogs running through the house.)  This is not a problem with our better made area rugs.
Very happy we made this purchase.  Easy to move around, works well, good value for the moolah!

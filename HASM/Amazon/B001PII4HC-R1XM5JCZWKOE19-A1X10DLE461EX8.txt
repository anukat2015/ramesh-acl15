Title: The battery life kills this product
Content:
The packaging is beautiful and the size is wonderful. The battery life is simply not good enough to make the product useful to me.
Booting the machine is painfully slow. It takes something like 5 minutes for a complete boot. If you want to tinker with registry and stuff maybe this could be reduced a bit.
What I want is a PC that acts like a cell phone: you open the cover and it is ready to go. 5 minute boot is not acceptable in that scenario.
You can avoid the boot by making the system sleep/hibernate when you close the lid. It takes less that a minute for it to wake up, and I could live with this, except the system consume significant energy when it is asleep. If I close the lid (and put the machine to sleep) on a full battery, it will not make it through the day asleep. If you use it for a half hour, you have reduced the sleep time quite a bit (a couple of hours).
I am sure Sony has a list of tips for extending battery life, but I don't want to become a laptop energy expert. 
My guess is that people who give powerpoint presentations would love this, also people who fly a lot. It would be great for them because it is so small and light and the battery life wouldn't matter because in both these situations you could plug it in.
I'm curious if replacing the hard drive with a flash drive would help. Also, maybe a faster hard drive would make the boot quicker. Windows 7 might help. Maybe running Linux would help the boot time too.
I've toyed with getting the extended battery, but the thought of spending another $100 after the original $999 is not very attractive. I'm seriously wondering if I can find someone who would trade a Kindel DX for the Sony.

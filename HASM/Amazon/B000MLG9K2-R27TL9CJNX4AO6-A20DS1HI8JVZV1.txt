Title: Great camera
Content:
I bought this camera about 4 months ago and I have to say it was probably the best camera I've ever used. Allthough the menues can be pretty overwelming the clairy of the pictures rankes it with the professional models at 2-3 times the price.  If you don't believe me just read the reviews from Popular Photography and Outdoor Photographer.  If you're an avid photographer or are looking to upgrade to a 10 megapixel DSLR, I HIGHLY recommend this camera.

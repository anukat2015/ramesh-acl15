Title: Certainly not perfect, but good for trips
Content:
About 15 minutes after I bought my TOUCH, I think they came out with a 64gb model for basically the same price. Who knew? I was going on a trip which required a 6 hour layover and wanted some entertainment to take along. This did the trick, although I do wish I'd had the option at the time for 64gb. I maxed out the 32 gb in no time at all. I think I've got about 400+ songs and maybe 8 movies on it right now. In retrospect, the 160gb iPod would have served me much better in the long run. While it lacks the great screen of the TOUCH it holds so much more and the controls are considerable more people friendly.
Ah well, live and learn. I like my TOUCH. I do think there are many ways to improve it, though. For instance, the controls are difficult. If I want to turn the volume up or down, it's sometimes a fight. Heaven help me if I want to move a little forward or back in a movie because it just ain't gonna happen. I accidently discovered the DELETE feature which was a wonderful surprise. In fact, there is not one thing on it that is easier than a regular iPod and I do not understand what the problem is with Apple that this is the case. It downloads easily, the movies are very clear and truly great to watch. I just wish they'd done something about the difficulty of the controls on this thing because it really does take away from the enjoyment I might get from it.

Title: Amazing at picking up hair!
Content:
We had used a cheap Oreck for the last 5 years or so and it didn't clean the carpets well at all.  We finally paid for the Bissel pet hair vacuum and it is amazing.  We have 6 dogs and 3 of them shed pretty badly.  It makes the carpets look like new again.  We do have to empty the cannister a lot, but I can't complain about that when I have 6 dogs.  I would guess that people with less dogs would not have to empty as much.  The attachments help with doing stairs and furniture.  And the price was good enough that even if I have to replace it often it is worth it.

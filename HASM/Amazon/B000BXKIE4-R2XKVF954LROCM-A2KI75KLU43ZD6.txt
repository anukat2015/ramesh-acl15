Title: Worth the Money
Content:
I thought this vacuum was a little pricy but after using it several times I think it was well worth the money. It cleans beautifully, actually does go from floor to carpet easily and has a crevice tool right on the handle for easy access. I have hard floors with area rugs on the first floor and white carpeting on the second floor; I also have 2 long-haired cats. It does a great job on all surfaces and is pleasantly quiet. I've tried other vacuums including a Eureka Boss upright, which was too heavy to maneuver and was actually digging into my floors and carpets and a small stick vacuum which was fairly good on hard floors but incredibly noisy. Ordering from Amazon was quick and easy and delivery was made within a few days. This vac was just what I was looking for!

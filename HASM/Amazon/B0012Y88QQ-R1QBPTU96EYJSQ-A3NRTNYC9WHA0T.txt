Title: Wonderful camera!
Content:
For someone who is used to a non-digital SLR, you will feel right at home with this one.  All the same functions are there, just shown on a menu to select electronically, instead of with manual adjustments.  You can use this as a point-and-shoot digital, or you can play to your heart's content.  The lens is great, and you can add a telephoto lens if you want.  It will take some learning for someone whose only experience is with a digital, but is a good choice for someone who wants to convert to digital from manual without losing all the versatility of the SLR camera.

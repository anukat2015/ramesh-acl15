Title: Quickly breaks down
Content:
We bought this vacuum 14 months ago. It worked great for the first 3 months. By 6 months we needed to replace the belt. By 8 months the height selector was broken. We talked to Bissell to have it fixed as it was still under warranty, but the only good option for us was sending the vacuum back to the company (we don't have a dealer close). It was going to take up to 7 weeks before we got it back. With 2 cats and a St. Bernard, we can't wait 7 weeks to vacuum. By 13 months we needed to replace the main brush. Pet hair gets wrapped around the upper filter (above the dust cup) and is difficult to remove with out making a mess.  I think if you don't need to use the "pet hair" height regularly, or have really short carpet, this vacuum may last longer. For us, it was not a wise choice.

Title: Feeble little heater
Content:
This heater is a little weak when heating an insulated garage when it is between 10 and 20 outside. Better get the 25k btu version. 
This doesn't have a built-in piezo electric igniter either. So you need a long stem lighter. 
There are better heaters like this. Don't bother with this one.

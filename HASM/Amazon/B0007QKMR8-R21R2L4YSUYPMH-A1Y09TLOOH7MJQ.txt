Title: Excellent Camera at a Reasonable Price
Content:
I selected this model of the Canon SRL camera line because of the acceptable mid-price and number of features available.  I was not disappointed.  The camera has been very easy to use and produces excellent pictures.  I was equally pleased when the digital camera worked perfectly with all of my old Canon SRL 35mm lens (thus saving me the requirement to buy another $.. in lens).  The only special point of interest about this camrea is that it appears much lighter than I expected.  Some may find this to be advantage (light to carry) and others may see it as a disadvantage (expecting quality with weight).  Overall, I am extremely please with the camera, the items included in the kit and the ease of purchasing it from Amazon.com.

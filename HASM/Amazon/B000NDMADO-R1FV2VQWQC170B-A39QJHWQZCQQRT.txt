Title: Dyson DC21
Content:
Excellent compact design, with full list of accessory tools from dust brush, crevice tool, and hardwood floor head.  Stores easily, and comes with a collapsable tube/wand for easy storage.  Power head could use a rug height adjustment, as the brush tends to bog down on thicker carpet.  Power head has a convenient on/off switch which saves hardwood floors, should you have the power head attachment going from carpet to bare floors.  The vacuum has very powerful suction, in fact, on many occassions, it actually lifts mats (such as bath mats) right off the floor.  Machine never loses suction (as per the manufacturer's claims,) but because the dust collection cannister is rather smallish, I have personally never had the opportunity to see this ~ the cannister fills up, but is easily emptied.  Using the vacuum on a 1200 sq ft apartment with a mix of carpets and hardwood floors (50/50), I've found that the collection cannister is about 80% full after two complete runs.  
Totally satisfied with Dyson product, and having used many different brands of vacuums (Hoover, Eureka, Phantom, Filter Queen, and Tri-star), I would have to say that this unit is the BEST of them all.

Title: Does a great job!
Content:
I chose the Panasonic MC-CG467 for cleaning our thick carpets in our new apartment. We used to only have wooden floors and our old vacuum cleaner was too big for our small apartment. I wanted a vacuum cleaner that has strong suction power on thick carpet, especially to remove cat hair. I am happy to say that after using it for a few weeks, it works perfectly on thick carpet as well as the kitchen and bathroom floors. Great choice for a small space! The only downside for me is that the vacuum cleaning bag is quite small and has to be replaced more often than I would prefer.

Title: Awsome
Content:
My first DSLR.
This is as good as it gets folks! I got the 18-55 kit a week ago and have already ordered the 55-200 lens and the speedlight. I'm positive there are better cameras out there, but for the price, it's hard to see how this can be beat. I'm eagerly learning the manual modes to really be able to use all the creative freedom that this camera offers. I have only scratced the surface, but I'm blown away by how good the pic's look and how easy the camera makes taking "perfect" (to me anyway) shots. 
It's solid but not bulky, the menus are just plain easy to understand (with a help system), and the buttons seem to have ended up just about where your fingers expect them to be.
If you are moving from a point-and-shoot to something more advanced, this is the one.

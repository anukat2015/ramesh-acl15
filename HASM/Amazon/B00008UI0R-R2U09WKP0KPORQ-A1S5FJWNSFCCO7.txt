Title: vacuum review
Content:
I was a little disappointed in this because it does not have the power of my old vacs and it very shortly fills up and needs emptying sooner than the old bagged variety.  But on the plus side it is lightweight and easy to carry around, it also pulls easily, and the cord is quite long.  It has suction variability and I like turning it on low for dusting nicknknacks,  shelves, and walls.  The hand held rotating brush tool gets up cat hairs well.  It definetly does not do as good a job on the carpets as my old + 30 year old Hoover upright.  This would work well in a small apartment for light cleaning in a place that never really gets dirty, but for a country home with lots of tracks and animals this is not enough.

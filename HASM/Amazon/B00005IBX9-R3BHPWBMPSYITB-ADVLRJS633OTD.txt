Title: Excellent coffee maker
Content:
I'll start with the reason I didn't give this coffee maker 5 stars. The water container is very hard to get to and to see how much water you pour in. This is a considerable inconvenience. I overcame it by using a container with just the right amount of water and put that in the maker. It still is in an inconvenient position, however.
That said, the coffee maker is definitely commercial grade. While the documentation is not too good, it's pretty easy to get going with the unit. It's also a very stylish appliance that you'll be proud to have in your home or office.
Having a water filter is a big advantage but it can also get costly and inconvenient to have to buy them and keep them on hand. I use water that's already filtered so it's not going to be a problem.
The self-clean feature is also a good one.
I'm a coffee connoisseur so I demand excellent coffee. I grind it before putting it into the pot. So my review is based on freshly ground coffee. In my case, the coffee is above average and it doesn't take much time to brew. It also makes a few beeps when the brewing cycle has ended.
All in all, a very fine coffee maker for the person who loves great coffee and wants a stylish, commercial grade appliance to handle the job.

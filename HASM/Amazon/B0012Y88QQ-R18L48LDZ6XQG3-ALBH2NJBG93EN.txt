Title: Love It, but could have been better
Content:
It's a real good camera.
pros:
Takes nice large and good quality pictures
Quick continuous shot
Large preview screen
Able to take large quality and raw images simultaneously 
cons:
Motion capture isn't as good as advertised
Live view and continuous shot is not available under every feature
A bit more pricey compared to other entry level dslr competitors

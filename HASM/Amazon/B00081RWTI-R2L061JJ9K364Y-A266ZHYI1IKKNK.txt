Title: It's great
Content:
For all the reviews that say it's too high maintenance to clean...get over it!  It takes me less than 2 minutes to rinse and fill with water and beans.  It's not messy, you just have to rinse out the basket (which is with any coffeemaker with the same re-usable basket) and the grinder.  Unless you don't have the 30 seconds extra it takes to rinse the grinder, buy this product.  Once a week or so I wipe down the inside (another minute).  This is the second one I've owned and I love the freshly brewed coffee waiting for me in the morning!

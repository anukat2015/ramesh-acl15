Title: Great once you use paper #1 filters; permanent filter a joke
Content:
After the pot broke on my Philips coffee maker I was in in the market for a coffee maker that could brew quickly and into cups or mugs.  After reading the reviews on Amazon I settled on this one.  
My initial impressions were of disappointment.  The finely ground espresso blend I first tried caused the permanent filter to clog up and spill everywhere.  The next batch (a coarser grind of Starbucks Cafe Verona) also spilled when I put more than two scoops of coffee in.  (I like my coffee strong)
Finally I tried a suggestion I found on Amazon and replaced the permanent filter with paper #1 Melitta coffee filters and wow, what a difference.  The coffee tastes great and no longer spills.  The coffee maker makes a quick, hot cup of coffee and cleans easily once you use the paper filters.  Highly recommended.
Pros:
1. Inexpensive
2. Brews a hot cup of coffee quickly
3. Easy to clean up (with paper filters)  
Cons:
1. Permanent filter messy to clean (coffee all over the sink)
2. Does not like finely ground coffee with permanent filter
3. Spills if you put more coffee in than it can handle (permanent filter)
Morale of the story?  You'll be alot happier if you use the paper filters.

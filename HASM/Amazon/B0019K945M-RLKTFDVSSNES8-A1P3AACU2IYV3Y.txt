Title: Disappointed!
Content:
I bought LX-100 because it has multifunctional features. I tried to use the dehumilifier mode without two hoses connecting to window slot, and it never gets a single drip of water in the tank.  Very disappointed! 
Heater is claimed to be the most powerful 110 volt heater on the market, but it blows out very little warm air. worst of all, the left side of panel is actually blowing out the COOL AIR!!

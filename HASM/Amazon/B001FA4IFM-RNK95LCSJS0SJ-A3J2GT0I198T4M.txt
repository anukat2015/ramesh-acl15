Title: Great for a small office
Content:
This is a great little heater -- I use it at work under my desk to combat the seemingly constant flow of AC from the office vent system.  Even in the 750w "LO" setting, it very-quietly pumps out a steady stream of heat until it reaches the desired temperature.
Pros: small, great heat output, extremely quiet, pretty affordable
Cons: the thermostat is fairly limited, only allowing you to choose 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 and no degree-increment in-between.  navigating the "one touch" UI is a little annoying

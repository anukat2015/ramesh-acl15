Title: This is the best vacuum I have had so far!!!
Content:
I recently purchased this vacuum after careful consideration and I am very happy that I did. I have had a few cleaners - most recently the Rainbow which was okay - I have allergies so the water system was good at catching all that junk I vacuumed up - however, I found that system to be cumbersome - too much switching around to clean and too much work, not to mention heavy and a lot of stuff to store. This Hoover is lightweight, compact, very powerful! Also, very easy to get out of the box and use right away - just plug in the main floor hose and go! I love the retractable cord - great so my bunny doesn't get it - and also the dirt cup was very easy to rinse out and clean. The best part is the Hepa filter and all the extra stuff I get up that the Rainbow didn't! I feel that with an animal around, this vacuum is the best! The power is wonderful and I love just switching to floor cleaning without having to completely change out the hose to a new one. I think the price is great too - got mine on sale but the Rainbow is outrageous pricewise - all other vacuums have caught up now I think and are much cheaper! Don't listen to the naysayers on this site - there is no problem putting this machine together - it already is - and the dirt cup you just dump in the trash and rinse in the sink! I give this 5 stars so far!!!

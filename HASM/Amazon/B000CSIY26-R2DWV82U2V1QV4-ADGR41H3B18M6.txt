Title: Good, if a little loud.
Content:
Getting the package was a little bit confusing. I recieved multiple emails saying that my order had been processed and such, but I did not receive my tracking number until AFTER the package had already been delivered. I'd expect a little more for that much money paid in shipping. THe unit arrived in good condition though, and works nicely in my small space. I haven't run it enough for the unit to need draining yet, so we'll see how that goes, but so far it's been a good deal, no complaints.

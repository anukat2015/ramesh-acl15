Title: Looks Better Than It Works
Content:
I live in a 1250 sq. ft. open loft space with only a gas fireplace for heat. Upstairs in the loft office I needed auxiliary heat.  What I liked about this unit was its looks and its wheels -- it just rolls around the floor quite easily.  Unfortunately, the heat it puts out doesn't seem to reach very far from the source.  You can feel the heat with your hand a few inches from the panel, but my desk chair is only 3 or 4 ft. away, with the unit behind me, and my back and shoulders are still quite chilled.  I'm guessing that the absence of a fan or any radiant elements limits this unit's effectiveness.  Bottom line: I'm still cold.

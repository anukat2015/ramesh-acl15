Title: Still Hoping
Content:
My IPOD isn't holding a charge - only about 1 1/2 hours instead of 24. I was told to keep charging it to the fullest and it should work better. Something about it sitting too long on the self. I've been doing that for a month - other option is to take it to a store which would be putting me out. OK, when I get it to either to work right or fixed I'll do another review.

Title: buyers beware
Content:
Folks, go try the vacuum at a store before buying.
All the hinges are made of low grade plastic and they bend and break easily.  Mine is only 2 months old and the wand is separating due to the plastic not being strong enough.  Power switch is also not working half of the time.
Maybe I have a lemon, but you can tell that the vacuum is made flimsy and from China...

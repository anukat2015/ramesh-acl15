Title: If it loses power, it needs a new belt !!!!
Content:
I have had this vacuum for about a year. It was great for 6 months. Then it started not picking up anything. So, I read others comments on here and one lady said "Get a new belt if it goes bad"  Yes, I did that and now its fine !!!!!  It sucks up SO MUCH DIRT, I can't believe my house is that filthy. So, if your vacuum loses its suction, don't throw it out. Just buy a new belt !!!

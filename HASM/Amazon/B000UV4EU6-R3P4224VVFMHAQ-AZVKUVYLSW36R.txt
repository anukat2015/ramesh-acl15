Title: The Creative Zen is an answer to my prayers!
Content:
What I was excited for when I purchased my first Mp4 player was being able to play uploaded videos and pictures....
  Well....my first Mp4 purchase was a generic brand that showed the video file name in the player, but when selected nothing happend- IT DIDN'T WORK-
So I figured name brand was probably my best bet and purchased the SONY mp4 player which had software and all that- but the software didnt convert the videos into the right format for the player (or something- the guide was confusing) -AGAIN IT DIDNT WORK OUT-
  So finally after giving up on the idea for a couple months, I tried one last time to find and buy a player that played video (and pictures)-
I went to my local Walmart and stood at the locked Mp4 display for awhile, asked the store clerk to see the 3 I had narrowed it down to- and liked the size of the CREATIVE ZEN display screen compared to the other two at around the same price crossed my fingers praying that it would play my videos....got home...plugged it in- installed the software...
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW! IT WORKED! MY PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED! THE SOFTWARE IT CAME WITH HAS AN EASY TO FIGURE OUT VIDEO CONVERTOR- PICTURES AND MUSIC WERE A BREEZE TO UPLOAD TOO- AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY THE VIDEO/PICTURE QUALITY- CRISP AND CLEAR~
I PLUGGED MY CREATIVE ZEN INTO MY STEREO IN MY CAR (VIA AN AUDIO CABLE-SOLD SEPERATLY) AND THE MUSIC/SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT TOO!
The buttons are easy to remember- i don't even have to look at the player anymore when I use it in the car (while driving).
now....only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 stars is there has been one lil problem I've been having with the player....I've had it for almost a year now, and only in the last month has it happend- but a couple times after unplugging it from my computer the player has shut off and not turned back on like it should- I found the tiny little RESET hole and have had to "RESET" it a few times- but it has always come back on and NEVER deletes any memory when I've reset it....(which the fault may be because of an old USB cord i WAS using- and also because I had it plugged into a cheap multi USB hub)
SO moral of my story is:
I LOVE IT, IT PLAYS GREAT VIDEO/PICTURES AND AUDIO/MUSIC- would definitly recommend it to a friend!!!

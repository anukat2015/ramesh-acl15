Title: 5 STARS for me
Content:
I don't even know why there are ratings that are even lower than 4 stars! This camera is EXCELLENT for starters! It comes really close to a 50D in quality and an extra recording feature is nice. Even though the price is not attractive to some people, I don't believe this camera deserves a rating below 4 stars. It is simply EXCELLENT! I've had it for a month now and I absolutely think its one of the best in its league. The stock lens aren't so great, but if u want better pictures.. u have to pay the price.

Title: Be careful of this model---and purchasing computers from Amazon!
Content:
I purchased this model after debating over another model that I had purchased for my son.  The very first day it displayed a "No Operating System found" message on a black screen.  My husband told me to immediately return it.  I gave it some time thinking it was a fluke.  NOPE---tonight it began making a loud noise---then a blue error screen quickly disappeared to a black screen "No operating system found" message.  I contacted SONY and was told this was hard-drive and they could not help me over the phone.  It was suggested that I return the model for a new one.  WELL---today is ONE DAY TOO LATE to return to AMAZON.  Could I be any luckier?  I would advise you to carefully examine the RETURN POLICY to AMAZON.  After reading this tonight--I am thinking that I made a costly mistake to purchase a computer from Amazon and this model might have been a mistake as well.

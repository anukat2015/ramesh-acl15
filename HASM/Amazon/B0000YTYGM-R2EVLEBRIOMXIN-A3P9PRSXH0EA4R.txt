Title: Be Careful
Content:
This makes delicious coffee that stays hot for most of the day without becoming "scorched" from being on a hot burner all day. Just be sure you place the filter in carefully so that it snaps in place and screw the lid on the carafe, otherwise you will have coffee all over your counter top and floor, and you will need to get every single ground out of the filter holder before it will work properly again. If you are one to be slightly careless about screwing on lids and such, think twice about this purchase.

Title: No problem here!
Content:
I've been using this heater for several years and have had no problems whatsoever. About 1/2 the heat is radiant, the other half is hot air rising from the unit.
It will burn for 12 to 14 hours before having to refill its 1-gallon removable tank. During this time, it emits no smell at all. The heat adjustment range is from 90% to 100% - like any kerosene heater, it is not safe to try to turn it down below this range.
The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the electric lighter bulb burns out too easily - it is like a flashlight bulb without the glass bulb - when you press the igniter, the bulb's glowing filament presses against the wick, igniting it - if the wick doesn't break the filament. In this case, a long wand butane lighter works just fine.
It is true that the very first time a kerosene heater is lit, it will stink. Once the burner has come up to operating temperature for the first time, the metal parts become annealed and ready for use. If the other reviewer lit it for the first time indoors, not knowing this, it would have been a very unpleasant surprise. The first time should be outdoors. After that, you can take it inside.

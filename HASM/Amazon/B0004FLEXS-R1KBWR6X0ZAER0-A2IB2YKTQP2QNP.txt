Title: This is the Best!!
Content:
For the money this is the best coffee maker you can buy.  My husband has been so irritated in the past with coffee makers that spill all over the place when you pour a cup of coffee.  This one doesn't miss a drop.  The water reservoir is excellent.  Plenty of room to pour in the water.  The only negative thing that I could say about this product is that the coffee isn't hot enough.  Other than that it is an excellent buy.

Title: Love it
Content:
I love this coffee pot.  It is over all a great looking color, and is nice with my kitchen.  But I love how quiet it is and is so easy to fill and pour.  It keeps the coffee nice and hot. I read all the reviews when I purchased this product, and I have had no troubles at all with this.  There are always going to be a bad  apple in the bunch, but over all my apple red coffee maker is great.

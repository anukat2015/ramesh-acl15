Title: Ceramic Heaters are the best & so is Amazon.com!Thanks!
Content:
I just bought this as a gift for my son who lives out of state; I ordered it and he got it in 2 days by regular UPS! Amazon is always a great place to order from--u can rely on them having the best prices and quick, efficient shipping that's free on a lot of items. I always compare them with eBay and usually Amazon wins!
I've had a Lasko ceramic heater for years now and I have to say that a ceramic heater is the best/so much better than the old space heaters with the heating elements u can see and no fan! We have a pellet stove for the main part of the house so we use the Lasko in the master bath and sometimes the master bedroom/we don't really notice it driving our electric bill up either. It works wonderfully and is very quiet. Mine also has the fan only feature for the summertime but am not sure if this particular model(755320) has that. I'm pretty sure that my older one was made in the US and this one imported from China(shame on you Lasko!)so I hope he has as good of luck with his as I've had with mine!Reading some of the reviews about the cord getting hot,etc..is kind of scary so I told my son to keep a close eye on his. I'd still order a ceramic heater over any other kind though--they really are the best space heaters on the market!

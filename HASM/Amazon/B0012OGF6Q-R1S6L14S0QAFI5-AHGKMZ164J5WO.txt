Title: Great entry level D-SLR
Content:
Okay, it's 10.2 megapixel, it gives you great pictures, and has plenty of options.
And it's one of the cheapest D-SLRs on the market right now,
There are downsides.  The flash does not have a commander mode for using wireless flashes, there are only 3 autofocus zones, Nikon does not make an extended battery grip for this model, and the camera will only autofocus with the AF-S and I believe AF-I lenses.  Older lenses are still usable, but only with manual focus.
Ok, all of the bad stuff is now out of the way.  Everything is pretty straight forward to set up to take good pictures.  I have personally seen point and shoots that have less intuitive controls without having all of the versatility that this camera provides.
The included lenses are very good considering that they come in a package that costs less than $1000 with the body.  The Image Stabilization is very good, and optical quality is high for the price range.
Personally, I see very little reason to get an advanced point and shoot over the D60.
In my humble opinion, I think that the Canon XSi/450D is a superior camera; however, I personally could not justify the added expense.  The other option from Nikon is the D80, which answers all of my criticisms; however, many first time SLR owners will probably like the added feeling of comfort from the D60's self-cleaning image sensor which is one feature that the D80 lacks.  Either way, Canon or Nikon you can't really go wrong in the long run.

Title: hit or miss
Content:
The product is good, but only if you get one that works.  I bought three to get one that works.  The first one I received did not work at all.  I followed all instructions, left it running for 2 hours but it stayed cold as ice.  Thinking it was just bad luck in getting a defective product, I returned it and received a replacement only to experience the same exact problem.  I called DeLonghi customer service and after I explained what I experienced, the person concurred with me that the product is defective and told me that I should just return it.  I returned the second defective product and got a refund. I did get my money back but I was frustrated with all the trouble I had to go through to return the product, twice (the heater is heavy and bulky). I looked for other similar products in retail stores but could not find another one that I liked and wanted. I took the chance and bought a third one at a local store and third time lucky, this one worked.  It is the exact same product but the last one I got has the label Made in China and the other two defective ones were made elsewhere (I can't remember the country but it was indicated in a three letter acronym). Same brand, same product, but I guess the company does not have the same QA standards at all of its factories. So all in all, if you get one that works, it is a very nice heater but you need luck to get one of those good ones.  It is a hit or a miss.

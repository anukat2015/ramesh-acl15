Title: My first, thrilled!
Content:
Bought my first, always have it with me.  I use my own Shure ear phones since the ones that come with this aren't that comfortable (my kids are fine with them, though).
LOVE the interface.  Easy to use, crisp screen, great sound.
Bought the 4GB for my daughter within a week of buying this one.
Will buy another.

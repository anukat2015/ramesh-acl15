Title: Very Balanced Little Package

This really hits the new sweet spot for portable laptops. I think by now pretty much everyone's over the netbook craze. Yeah, great idea but at the end of the day they're way too small and they have almost no computing power with those wimpy Atom processors. yet most of us who travel don't want to lug around a 15"-16" brick. Along comes the 13.3" form factor. Amd with it, HP almost hit a grand slam with this DM3. As many others have correctly said, the track pad is nothing short of awful and the mouse buttons are too stiff. That pretty much sums up the negatives of this otherwise wonderful machine. The display is gorgeous, it's fast as all get-up (I have the Su7300 processor and 7200 rpm hard drive), it has plenty of RAM (4 gigs), the speakers are more than acceptable for a small laptop, battery life is awesome and it's a classy looking unit clad in all metal.
I'm one of those who remember when laptops cost upwards of $1500 for a bare bones machine that couldn't do half of what this one does. At it's price point, it's a steal. Highly recommended.
But HP should be ashamed of it's horrid touchpad. C'mon guys, you can do better!!!

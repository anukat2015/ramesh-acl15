Title: Suddenly it quit!
Content:
This heater worked great until it quit suddenly one morning.  When it worked, it was quiet and put out lots of heat.  But, like others who have commented here, I had the experience of it simply being unwilling to turn on -- out of the blue.  It lasted six months.  Great heater while it lasted.  But, factor into your cost equation if the price is worth it for six months or less of heat.

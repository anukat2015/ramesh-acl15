Title: Great Buy!
Content:
Bought this vacuum 2 weeks ago...when it arrived I used the barefloor head attachment immediately and was impressed with how well it worked on my hardwood floors.  Then I tried to use the power head on the carpets...it didn't work!  Turns out the electrical plug on the power brush was busted...I called technical support. They were nice and helpful...diagnosed the problem and sent out a new head, which arrived in 3 days.  It works great on carpets!  Could not be happier with my purchase.

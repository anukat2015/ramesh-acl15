Title: Hard working heater!
Content:
I purchased 3 of the units, two for own shop and one for my son-in-law.  They work GREAT!  Easy to use and move around.
I put two of these in a 24'x36' building and leave them on all the time, I use the 900 watt setting, and they have, so far, kept my building around 57 degrees.  Although winter is just starting it's been pretty cold the last couple of weeks, these heaters are doing a supurb job!  My building is well insulated and has a 4' deep foundation around it, but still that's a lot of space for just two little heaters.  Haven't seen the electric bill yet, but I can't imagine it costing that much to run them as opposed to my kerosine heater.  Plus I no longer have to put up with the smell of the kerosine.  And the best part is there are no exposed flames to worry about.  These heaters are great!  I highly recommend them for anyone who is heating a well insulated space or a small space.

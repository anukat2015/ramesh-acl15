Title: Match Book Sized Powerhouse!
Content:
This thing is great. I wish I could go back as little as 15 years ago, and freak people out. Well worth the price (if you get one that lasts). I love the plug in to the computer recharge deal. It may prove to be flawed, but I can't complain as of now. I was wondering if this had enough storage for fun. I got about 600 songs on here for the first load......Lets see...How many cd's is that?...around 50 or so!...not bad! It may deserve 5 stars, but that is perfection after all......that takes time.

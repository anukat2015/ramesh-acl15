Title: Great little heater
Content:
For twenty bucks this heater performs very well.  I use it on the "low" setting and it keeps the bedroom nice and toasty during the evening hours.  It's much more economical to heat one room rather than the entire house and the thermostat ensures that it will run only when it needs to.  Build quality is good.  It comes in white which suited the room I wanted to place it in.  Very happy with this purchase.

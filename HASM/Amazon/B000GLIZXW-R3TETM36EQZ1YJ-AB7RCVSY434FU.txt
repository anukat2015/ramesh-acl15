Title: Momma is very happy
Content:
We recently purchased a new house in Florida with a fireplace in the family room. The first day my wife said, "Oh, let's build a fire." I replied, "Are you nuts, it's 95 degrees out there!" But I had a plan.
Went on Amazon and ordered this unit which arrived in only two days. All I had to do was unpack it, slide it into the existing fireplace, and plug it in. The flames are very, very realistic and the logs glow just like the real thing. Now she's happy, and as we all know, when momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy. Only one small problem. Now she wants another one for the bedroom!

Title: Good coffee, but not so durable
Content:
I bought the Krups FME4-14 partly for the Krups reputation, and partly because it would look good on the counter.  Also, I liked the latch on the hinged door of the grounds holder, which would keep me from grabbing the pot and accidentally knocking the door open.
The unit makes great coffee, quickly.  And despite the less than clear operating manual, it was relatively easy to program. 
As others have noted, the pot drips so I'm always cleaning up water or coffee spills. This was a huge irritant.
I also had the coating on the heater base flake off, even though I never cleaned it with anything other than a damp paper towel. However, this wasn't all that unsightly, since it wasn't very visible with the pot in the machine, which is the usual case.  
Unfortunately, the coffee maker isn't all that durable.  I had it about a year before the top hinge on the grounds door failed, letting the door fall off when opened.  There's a wire spring running up the door edge, that connects to the body through a pin at that upper corner.  Eventually the plastic pin and coffee maker body wore enough, and the door began to periodically fall off. After several reinstallations and repair attempts, I finally had to throw the coffee maker away.

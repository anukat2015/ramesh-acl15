Title: Ipod 5G is a HIT!
Content:
well, there are many things to look at when buying a mp3 player
1) Sound, well it is what you bought it for isnt it? the sound isnt Perfect, but its very good And gets far better if you dont use the headphones that came with it.
2) Battery life, 14 hours is what its rated but i normally get around 10-12 this is probably because i like to browse pictures and watch the occasional video on it every so often, but this isnt a huge problem since i can easily charge it every night when i go to bed
3) Looks, as everyone knows its absolutely beautiful. By far the most stuning mp3 player out there
4) (because it plays video) Screen quality, the screen on this device is Perfect, couldnt ask for anything better
5) use, using this device is Incredibly simple, making playlists is also very simple
Really the bigest flaw in this is its battery life, Before buying this i had a Gmini 400 (Archos) and a HD1 (sony) and i like the ipod the best By far, if your bigest concern is battery life this is not the product for you, otherwise this is By far #1

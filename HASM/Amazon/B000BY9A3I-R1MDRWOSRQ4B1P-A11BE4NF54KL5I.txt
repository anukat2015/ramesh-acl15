Title: Best product for wood and tile floors
Content:
For the price you won't find anything better than this vac for hardwood and tile floors.  The carpet cleaning attachment is ok for carpets but is difficult to use on high pile, works good on low pile berber.  Suction is unbelievable, noise is average with a slight high pitch whine at full power.  I've use Dyson (overpriced and cheaply made), Oreck(overpriced and cheaply made), and Miele (just plain overpriced) and none outperform this dirt devil on hard floors.  Note, this will not work as a primary carpet vacuum.

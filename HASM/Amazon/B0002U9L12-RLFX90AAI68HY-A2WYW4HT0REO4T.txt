Title: Sorry, I'm not happy with this one but...
Content:
It proves you only get what you pay for.  My old Mr. Coffee, which lasted over five years, died. I wanted a thermal design at an reasonable price. This little devil makes me 3 1/2 cups which is ok as I am the only coffee drinker (usually when manufactures say "cup" they mean 6 oz. cups). However, with company this pot is not convenient.  The lid is tough to twist off and on. Pouring water into the thing is messy. The water level on the side is hard to see and I have brewed coffee on my counter top too many times to count. I continue to use it as it was the least costly of any I found.  Next time I'll spend more.  Most coffee makers are too tall to fit under counters. The new Mr. C under counter maker would be nice if it had a thermal carafe. Would not recommend this one.

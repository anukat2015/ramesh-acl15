Title: This Shark stole my dollar!
Content:
Upon my first use of it I powered the device on by touching the switch. One will note that the vac is extremely loud. I own 2 Dyson standard size vacuums (which I believe are the greatest electronic/household devices on planet earth) and its high decibel sound mimics that of my Dysons. This cordless vac really packs a punch where suction is concerned. I had a dollar on the window sill and was vacuuming one side and it sucked up my dollar off the windowsill. I thought it was strong and that this was hilarious! I always remember the Shark commercials where the hand vac can suck up a bowling ball, so I would assume this vacuum displayed great strength with suction. 
 Update: Upon later usage of it, it would no longer hold a charge. What happened was this.. the black square on the back for which you put the charging cord into somehow got loose and was no longer staying in its necessary place. The battery door also had in issue which did not allow it to stay screwed in place completely, either. Calls to Shark were futile, as the customer service agent spoke poor English and could not understand the issue at hand. They wanted $12.95 to ship it back to them to repair. We went to Target and invested in a Dirt Devil. My husband advised me that because these hand vacs barely last 2 years, might as well get a cheap one (albeit, the DD wasn't cheap but did come with a 3 year warranty)...
The vacuum itself sucks well and I enjoyed it while it lasted..

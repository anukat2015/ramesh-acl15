Title: Great camera with swivel display and HD video
Content:
I was looking for an upgrade to my compact digital camera and knew I wanted to have HD video too. This was a great deal and I got the 55-200mm lenses also as a package for $700. There was a rebate offer too and so I get $80 back on top of the bundle discount.
The camera is good to use on auto and pre-set pic mode. But the manual settings are what you're paying for and I've yet to fully take advantage of these. However, in auto mode I did take the camera out for a night and was disappointed that in low light the camera performed worse than my compact point-and-shoot. I mean, with the old Canon Ixus I could take a shot in the dark. With the D5000 it wouldn't let me take a shot until I cheated it (by pointing it at a brighter object and locking the lense by pressing down 1/2 way on the shutter button. Then I moved to the darker subject and fully depressed the button to get the camera and flash to work.

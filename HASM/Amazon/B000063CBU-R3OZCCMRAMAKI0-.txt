Title: JUNK!!!!!
Content:
This is a piece of JUNK! The steaming tube is to short, needs to be out the side of the machine and longer. The steam from the espresso ruined the clock and controls, it wont turn off and the on light just flashes. The espresso only brews a double shot then steams the last double shot, should brew a quad shot. Stops brewing espresso after double shot, have to manually adjust the richness level knob to get the other double out. Coffee is way to cold! Needs a built in espresso tamper to compress the espresso grinds in the cup for better more efficient brewing. Just an all around space taker on my counter top. Not user friendly!

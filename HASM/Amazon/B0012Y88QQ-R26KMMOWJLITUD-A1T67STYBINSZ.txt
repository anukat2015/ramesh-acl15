i'm new on digital photography, a friend was living in the States, I live in Guatemala City, as soon as she brought it I started taking a shot to everything, i can't stop loving it, even my friends love it, and for the prize...no where else amazon can be beaten.  A great product for anybody who is undecided about getting this or another nikon or canon upgrade, my advice, get this one ( which is incredible) and buy more lenses, its not about the camera, but the effect u are trying to get with the lenses...
pd. the only thing that i dont like that much is the lense..but bleh since it comes already with the kit for the prize is ok..but get a 50mm f1.8 instead if possible, way better for beginners like me :) cheers everyone!

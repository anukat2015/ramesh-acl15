Title: Great value!
Content:
Extremely great camera for the price!  With a larger lens you will need an external flash rig otherwise you will cash shadows... and it's a good idea with a small lens too because the cycle time is a little slow with the on board flash at night.  But, during the day or with an external flash it's fantastic.

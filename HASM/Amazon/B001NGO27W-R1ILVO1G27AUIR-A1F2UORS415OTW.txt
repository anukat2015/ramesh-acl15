Title: Makes the best coffee and looks very stylish.
Content:
Last weekend, my old coffeemaker produced its last pot of coffee. Thank goodness, because the Cuisinart DCC-2600 is an amazing upgrade for me! I selected this coffeemaker based on customer reviews and ratings. For those of you that participate in this activity on Amazon.com, thank you!
The design is sleek and modern. It looks very stylish in my kitchen. Setting the controls is intuitive, except for 'Self Clean'. When the self clean LED lights, a cleaning cycle to remove calcium deposits is recommended. That was the only part of the instructions that I needed to read. A charcoal filter pellet is included. When this pellet is placed in its separate holder, it provides additional water filtering. Nice feature. The DCC-2600 measures just under 15 inches tall. With the lid opened, it needs about 23 inches for clearance.
There are three settings for carafe temperature. Another nice feature. The coffeemaker emits five brief beeps when brewing is complete. Kind of pleasant audible notification, actually. The coffeemaker beeps are not loud at all compared to my microwave.  Basic manual operation: set knob to brew, carafe temp to medium, press on/off button. Auto brew operation is just as easy.
As one famous Seattle resident joked, "In Seattle, you haven't had enough coffee until you can thread a sewing machine while it's running." Gotta love Seattle!

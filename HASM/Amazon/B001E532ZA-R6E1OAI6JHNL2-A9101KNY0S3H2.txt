Title: Like having a Butler
Content:
I own the first generation Tassimo (by Braun). It works fine but I love the Tassimo system so much, I upgraded for the improvements mentioned by previous reviewers. If you entertain at all, would like cappuccino, latte etc without the headache of a huge milk steaming machine - you will love the Tassimo. The only bad thing I can say is  about Tassimo.com's automatic delivery program. It's not good and their customer service is frustrating at best. I buy my discs from Amazon.

Title: Great item, however, for $20 more you can get bigger screen, bigger battery, and DVD rom
Content:
I purchased this item and tested it out for a few days.    The battery life is approx 6 hours on economy settings and only doing internet surfing.   I liked everything about this machine.  The touchy touch pad can be resolved by never removing the plastic tape that covers it up when shipped.   the touch pad works with the tape and the advantage is that it feels much SMOOTHER with the tape and you can feel a distinct difference in texture so you don't slip on and off of the tape.  Also it probably prevents people from accidentally registering movements with the palms.  
i returned it because the UL80VT-A1 is only $19 more and it's 14", has the 5600mh battery (vs the 4400) and has a DVD ROM.  
The UL30 is slim, but it's not THAT slim.  not like the Toshiba T135 series.   So adding a DVD rom isn't that big of a deal.   Plus i will be using it to watch DVD's and ripping CD's to Itunes.   
just my thought...  not sure why this model is so much more popular than the UL80VT

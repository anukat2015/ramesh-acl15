Title: Better convenience, better design, and far better tasting coffee.
Content:
I was a big fan of Senseo for a while, then it became old loading two or even three coffee pods for a reasonable sized cup of coffee.  When Senseo says a "cup," they literally mean a one cup measure.  That is a very small amount of coffee!  I had to get the optional large size water container as well, so I was not constantly refilling the reservoir.  Also, the Senseo is messy:  You are constantly throwing away wet, dripping coffee pods.  The Keurig solves all of these problems, and most importantly:  THE COFFEE TASTES BETTER!!!  This is, admittedly, a matter of taste.  But consider that each, individual Keurig pod is completely sealed until use.  They stay fresh.  The Senseo pods come in a bag, and once the bag is open, all the Senseo pods are exposed to air and they are not air or moisture tight.  From that moment on, the clock is ticking and the Senseo pods are degrading.  The Keurig machine is clearly the winner on all fronts: Better convenience, better design, and far better tasting coffee.

Title: Great.
Content:
I did not get the machine from Amazon but I do have it. It is a fantastic machine. It froths the milk into a nice micro foam that allows you to design on your espresso. The tamper it comes with is cheap, but it works and does not constitute a replacement yet. I have seen videos of tons of espresso makers, but this one makes coffee that looks the same, if not better.
It tastes very good. Top notch machine, not too loud.

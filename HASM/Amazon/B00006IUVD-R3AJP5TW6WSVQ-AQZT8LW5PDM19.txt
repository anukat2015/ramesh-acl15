Title: Great  little coffee maker
Content:
I was So happy to get this machine, I was tired of spending almost $2 every day for a cup of coffee.  
The cup is a little small, and does make the coffee start to taste a little 'plastic-y' after a while, I'm glad it's summer so I just make iced coffee and there is no odd flavor.  The coffee is brewed pretty fast and makes a great cup of coffee.  I use folgers original blend and I am very happy with this coffee maker.  It fits perfectly onto my counter in my little kitchen in my apartment and doesn't take up much space at all.
I would definitely recommend this coffee maker to anyone that is looking.

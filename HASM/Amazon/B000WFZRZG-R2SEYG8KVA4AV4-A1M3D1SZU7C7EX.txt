Title: Great player
Content:
I've been using my Zune for a bit over a year, and I've been consistently impressed by it. I use it in the gym, I use it at work, and I use it at home. At work and in the gym, it's hooked up to headphones, and at home speakers. I typically use it as the radio in the house, and use it as an MP3 player everywhere else.
In my year of use, it hasn't crashed on me (which is something I cannot say for the apple or creative players I've used), and the interface on the device itself it easy to use and in particular usable while jogging, through an armband (not the nice touch scrolling, of course; it's nice that you can click the touchpad too).
The Zune desktop software I have mixed feelings about... it's fast and generally okay as an interface (especially for setting up auto-playlists and other such tasks), but I'd really like a more normal file explorer sort of interface to the setting up of collection directories to sync. The new update that contains channels and auto playlists (which include songs that match criteria, such as tagged with 'rock' as the genre, or added to the collection in the last 24 hours, or on specific artist, or combinations of the various criteria) has been very nice, and means I can set up different mixes of songs for different things I'm doing without having to actually go through the collection to add each to the list.
In a year of use, this has absolutely earned it's five stars.

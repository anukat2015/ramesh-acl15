Title: Great product!
Content:
This heater is just perfect for a workshop,garage,basement,etc.Once mine is warmed up (about 10 minutes) it raises my 1800 ft2 basement/workshop from 56 to 70 degrees in less than an hour. This is NOT an insulated area of the home and this is Northern New England weather so trust me it works great!. Some reviews say it is hard to assemble...but if you actually have any problem with that,you likely should not be messing with a kerosene heater anyways!. It is simple to put together,fuel,and light.If you are not used to running these things you might have to fool with it some to find the "sweet" spot where you have zero odor.If it still smells, you do not have QUALITY K-1 fuel. Buy from a different source and use scented additive if needed. Overall, a terrific heat source if maintained and used properly. ENSURE you have a CO detector in your home...you should have one anyways but it is a lifesaver if you use any Carbon based fuel!

Title: Pretty Good Heater
Content:
I bought 2 of these; one heats a bedroom just fine; the living room is way too large for this heater, but until I can get a fireplace insert it will have to do.  They put out great heat on all sides, and my cats love to lie next to them.  The one in the living room goes 24/7 (although not always at highest setting), and the timer is very quiet.

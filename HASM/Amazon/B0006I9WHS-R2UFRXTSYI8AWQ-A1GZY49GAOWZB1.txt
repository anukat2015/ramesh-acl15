Title: Honeywell Ceramic Heater HZ-315
Content:
I like this little heater. My bedroom is actually in a finished,unheated basement. Brrrr! It puts out the heat and you can adjust it to  come off and on. It's very small;but that makes it very portable. The price is so low you can purchase several; but you can get by with one so as not to run up your electric bill. The appliance is nothing fancy;but it got me through the end of winter just fine.

Title: Sounds like a tiny sputtering boat motor
Content:
The shipment arrived faster than expected (nice), it was cold and I needed the heater.  Other recent negative reviews about their sudden deaths were trumped by how this one was out of the box.  The fan motor sputters away and it can barely muster a breeze.  I hoped it would self-heal (ha), and ran it for awhile a few different times.  On shut-down it sputters so badly it almost sounds relieved it's been turned off.  Back it goes.  Nice idea, bad manufacturing.

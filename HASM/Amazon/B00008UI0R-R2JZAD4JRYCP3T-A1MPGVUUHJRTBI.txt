Title: Powerful but flimsy
Content:
It's true it's powerful and pulls up the fine dust. But everyone who describes the flimsy handle is right. One week after receiving this, after using it only a few times, the handle will now not stay in the upright resting position when inserted in the main, large vacuum head attachment. Which means it has to be laid down horizontally on the floor everytime I let go of it. And the control button panel on the handle is so flimsy and cheap it's like something on a childs toy. I agree with the person who said this vacuum will last her about a year, but not longer than that. If you, like me, would prefer to have a better built vacuum that lasts longer after paying $200 including shipping, then get something else. The industrial designer who designed this at Hoover earns an "F". They really need to test these things with real people in real homes, before putting them on the market.

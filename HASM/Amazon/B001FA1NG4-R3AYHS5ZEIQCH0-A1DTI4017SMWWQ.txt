Title: iPod Nano
Content:
I got the nano as a birthday gift for my 10 year old daughter. She loves it. Its amazing how much the nano has improved since I had one a few years ago. Very happy with it. My only criticism is when the battery goes (which happens after a 3 years)you need to get a new one.

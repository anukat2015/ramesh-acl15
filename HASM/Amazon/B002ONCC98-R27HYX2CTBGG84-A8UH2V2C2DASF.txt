Title: So far, so good.
Content:
I was hesitant about buying a new laptop. I hate to spend so much on something that I know will be outdated soon, and I know little about the brand choices and what is best. I have had an HP Compaq laptop for 6 years and it has run well and is still working. I thought about getting a different brand this time around, but then decided that why should I when my experience with HP has been great, so far? I like the big screen and full keypad, including the extra number pad on the side. I do a ton of typing and writing research papers for work and grad school so I wanted something that would be easy on my eyes and comfortable to use. I knew I wanted more than 1 MB memory, more than 200 GB hardrive, and a dual processor. It was also important that the computer had Windows 7, not Vista. I did not want to spend over $700, either. I only received the computer yesterday and set it up and began transferring date from my other laptop, so i can't say much for the quirks it may have after time. However, it uploads data amazingly fast and streams video content from the internet beautifully.
Pros: 
lightweight
big screen
full kep pad
plenty of USB and other ports
touch pad is not overly sensitive and has scrolling on it
fast
easy to navigate
great support system to help figure out set up 
Windows 7 Home is enough for my day to day word processing
clear graphics
evenly weighted
not too many random extra things downloaded on it when received
Cons:
the speakers are terrible--very quiet

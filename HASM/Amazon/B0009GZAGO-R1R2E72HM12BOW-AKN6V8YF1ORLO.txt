Title: Great place to start in digital photography
Content:
After some extensive research, I settled on the D50 as the best value in the dSLR market.  I worked it down to the D50, the D70s, and the Canon Digital Rebel.
It was my goal to jump from taking a bunch of point-and-shoot photos with my much-beloved Fuji camera to really learning photography with some level of sophistication by jumping to a DSLR with some real power.
I am still working my way along the learning curve as a photographer, but I have been thrilled with the d50.  I had the benefit of a friend with a d70 and was able to handle that camera extensively before my purchase.  It has some added features, but if you, like me, are not at a photography level where you need cutting-edge stuff like depth-of-field preview, you would never know the difference.  I have yet to take a photograph and have the feeling that I wish I had spent the extra money on the d70.  It may well be that this is an "entry-level" dSLR, but if that is a fair description, it is also fair to say that the "entry" point is very high.  More often than not, the phrases "value" or "entry-level" imply "get ready to be disappointed."  That is definitely NOT the case here.  If you've never had a pro-level dSLR, at least, you'll feel like you're using a Ferrari.
One concession I did make to the d70 was the lens, however.  The consensus on the lens is that the d70 comes with a better base lens than the d50, so I bought the d50 body and the d70 kit lens separately.  I've been very happy with the results.

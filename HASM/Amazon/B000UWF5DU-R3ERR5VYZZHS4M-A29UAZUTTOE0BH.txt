Title: COFFEE MAKER REVIEW
Content:
I really like my new Black & Decker CMD3500MBT 8-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Thermal Carafe.  My only complaint is that it only makes 8 cups of coffee.  I would prefer a 12 cup machine.  
The coffee maker is very user friendly.  Clock and program EASY!!!  Filter is very accessible.  The BLUE lights make a great night light too.  
The carafe keeps the coffee hot for up to 4 hours.  The flavor remains good and does not taste burnt as it might if left on direct heat.
I highly recommend this coffee maker.

Title: Easy good coffee, but beware K-cup monopoly
Content:
I really like my Keurig, but I've been upset to discover that the supposed brand competition is mostly a sham.  Of the *licensed* brands available, all are owned by only two companies (Green Mountain Coffee and Diedrich Coffee), and Green Mountain is now trying to buy Diedrich.  Peet's is also bidding, and I hope they win, because otherwise prices and quality will be whatever Green Mountain wants them to be.
As long as there is the possibility of monopoly ownership and misleading branding, I cannot give this more than 3 stars.  It is good coffee, though.

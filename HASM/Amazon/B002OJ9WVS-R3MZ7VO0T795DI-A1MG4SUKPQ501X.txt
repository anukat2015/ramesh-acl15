Title: wish I'd bought it years ago
Content:
I purchased this Miele pretty much based on the customer reviews.  They all had it right. I was tired of buying other vacuums that were inefficient and cheaply made. You can stop wearing ear plugs when vacuuming! The telescopic hose is great; no loose hose parts to drag around. The cannister rolls around effortlessly and the motor is powerful. It's picking up stuff with one swipe instead of several. Yes, the bags are pricey but you can put your face over the exhaust and know the dirt is not coming back at you; the bags are thick and efficent. I have hardwood, ceramic tile, wool area rugs and tight berber throughout my home. For my purposes the floor tool it comes with works fine for all these surfaces.

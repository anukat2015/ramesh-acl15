Title: My 1st Single Lens
Content:
I had shopped for just over a year, weighing feedback on other equipment and watching the complaints very carefully.  I've owned this camera now for just over a month and I have shot about 1500 photos thus far.
I'm writing this primarily for those of you who are wanting to buy your first single lens, because it was scary for me to make such a huge decision based on people's opinions and not hard facts.
I would purchase this camera, again, in a heartbeat.  It is easy to use, fits well in my hand (and my hands are quite bony and large).  It is comfortable to use, and Olympus makes it easy by keeping things simple.
The only downfall I have experienced with the camera, is not the camera but with the software that accompanies the camera.  The Olympus software was useless, as were the directions to upload the photos.  But with trial and error I just figured it out.  My only word of the wise would be to plan using another digital imaging software.
The viewfinder was a bit awkward at first, but I've gotten used to it.  I haven't used the swivel out display much.
I shoot primarily portraits, nature, and jewelry.  The images will stand up against anything professional I've seen.
All in all, I consider it a good buy.

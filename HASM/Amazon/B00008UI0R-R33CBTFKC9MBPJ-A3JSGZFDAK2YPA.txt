Title: Love this vacuum!
Content:
I previously owned an upright WindTunnel bagless and wanted to replace it with a vacuum that would perform equally well and accept the same hand tools.  I looked at the new uprights and then at this canister. This WindTunnel canister is even BETTER than my old upright!  It is lighter to lug around and has EXCELLENT suction power.  It's easy to empty and I like that the cord is retracted with a quick push of the foot. The floor tool that comes with it works well on both my laminate floors and my carpet.  Definitely 5 stars!

Title: Good for the money!
Content:
I had a Mr. Coffee that just wouldn't die. It also barely made a pot of coffee without making a mess (For some reason the paper filters always went askew in the drip process and overflew). 
 Anyway this has a auto shut-off, and everything for less than Two Zero at Wally World. Plus the new makers are so stylish they look corny. One I saw has what looks like a sonar on it??? Hey I want a cup of coffee I'm not try to spot anything entering my air space.

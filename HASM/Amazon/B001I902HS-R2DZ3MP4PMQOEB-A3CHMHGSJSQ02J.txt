Title: Great alternative to heavy upright
Content:
This makes a nice change from my heavy upright, which I only bought a few months ago but whose weight wore on me quickly. The suction is good, but the "bare floors" setting sometimes glides over the dirt instead of picking it up. I'm going to stick with my broom for the floors. The cord storage/retraction is a HUGE improvement over my upright, which requires a lot of cord babysitting both during and after vacuuming. Also, it's a lot easier to pick up a canister and move it than a heavy upright, so I'd definitely recommend this model to anyone with a bad back (like myself) who finds it hard to maneuver and lift an upright.

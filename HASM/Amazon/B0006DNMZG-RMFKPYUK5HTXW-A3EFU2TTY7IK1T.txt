Title: Thermostat a real problem
Content:
The concept of this heater looked great, but it has one fatal flaw--the thermostat.  It seems to think the room is much hotter than it actually is.  As a result, even at the highest setting it shuts off after a short period of time.  Yet the room is still cold--and there's no way to turn the heater back on.  You basically have to wait 20 minutes for the heater to "cool down" enough to work again.  We basically don't use it, and we went out and bought another.

Title: Awesome laptop, horrendous battery
Content:
Excellent laptop, aesthetically and technically, but the battery performance, as noted in other reviews, is under 2 hours under standard power settings (contrary to Sony specs which state 4 hours, referring to power saving settings which render the computer almost unusable). This is a HUGE handicap, as I dont think I've had a laptop with such a short battery  life since 1997. Large capacity battery is available from Sony for outrageous $250, but only adds 1 hour under standard power settings. If it weren't for the battery, this would be a 5 star review.

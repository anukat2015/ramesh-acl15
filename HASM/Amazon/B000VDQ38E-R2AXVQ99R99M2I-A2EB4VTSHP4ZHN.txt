Title: I love this vacuum!!!
Content:
I have two cats and one of them is a white long hair and I of course have black furniture.  This vacuum is the best it picks up so well I could not believe all the dirt that my old vacuum left behind.  The turbo tool works so well I can save so much money on those pet hair roller adhesives.  I have two floors in my house and the vacuum really isn't that heavy.  I highly recommend this vacuum.  My boyfriend and I fight over who gets to vacuum now...I never thought that would ever happen.

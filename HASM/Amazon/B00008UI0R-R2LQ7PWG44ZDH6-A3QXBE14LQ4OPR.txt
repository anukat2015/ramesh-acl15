Title: Great little vac
Content:
This little Vac really does the job. It is easy to manuver and has good suction. The bagless is a very good idea. The dirt container is a little small but big enough to do the job and its real easy to empty.If using a  vaccuum could be fun, this one would be in the running. Long and short I like it.

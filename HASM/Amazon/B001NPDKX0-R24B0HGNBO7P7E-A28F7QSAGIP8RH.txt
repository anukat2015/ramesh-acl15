Title: HDX16 HP Pavilion Laptop
Content:
This is by far the best computer I have ever owned. My old HP was also great, but it would overheat at times like many of the older laptop models do. This computer is awesome, and comes packed with so much power for a very reasonable price. It also looks very sleek, and has some "extra" features that I really enjoy (including the finger scanner that I originally underestimated as to it's convenience...very useful!). You won't be disappointed if you buy this computer!

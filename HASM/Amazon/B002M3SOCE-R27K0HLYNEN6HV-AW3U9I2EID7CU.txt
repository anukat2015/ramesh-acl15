Title: I love this thing! Ipod Touch 3rd gen 32g
Content:
I purchased my Ipod touch more than a month ago and I am still very happy with it. In fact, I am not interested in the Iphone so I don't have to find Wifi Hotspots when I am out and about. I am with Verizon though so I can only hope the rumors of a Verizon version are true! Back to the touch. I have no trouble with it at all. I was able to add it to my itunes library which I already had set up with an Ipod Classic for a few years. I do have both Ipods and use my 80g Classic for the major capacity stuff like movies. I only have music and apps on my touch. As for the apps, there are a ton of free ones and cheap ones. I have several and everytime I think of something I need I use my To Do list app to keep up with the ones I want to look for when I get a wifi connection. I would highly recommend this to someone looking to buy it. It is light weight and great for the gym. You can also find good deals on accessories and bundles on Amazon and Ebay to complement the device. It has the speakers that play when you do not have the ear phones attached and that is cool when you want to share a song with someone and don't have your earphones or the splitter. There are still features on it I haven't used so I cannot comment on those. I am glad to answer any questions a potential buyer may have-that's how I shop too-just use the comment option. All in all this is a great product in my opinion!

Title: $50 Heater in a $500 package
Content:
This, and a host of other infrared quartz heaters, are now being marketed as being capable of heating 1000 square feet of space.  However if you read the specifications closely, you will note that it is nothing more than a common 1500 watt electric space heater, that produces 5000 BTUs of heat.  Which is the same as just about every $40-$50 electric space heater.
The only way it would have a chance of heating 1000sf of space, would be if the outside temperature was in the mid-50s.
It is wrapped in an attractive cabinet, with lots of buttons, and a remote control.  It is quiet.  And the cabinet stays cool.  So I give it an extra star for being a nice package.  It would be a decent buy if it sold for around $80.
But as far as saving money on heating bills, forget that.  It is no better than any other 5000 BTU heater.  How could it be?  That is a measurement of its heat output.

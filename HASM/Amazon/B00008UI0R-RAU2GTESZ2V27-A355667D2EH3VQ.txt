Title: Very Powerful!
Content:
I love this vacuum!  It is very powerful and it does the job!  I have never owned a bagless vacuum but this one is great!  I too wish that ALL the attachments stored in the vacuum and I would like it if the cord where longer to save time from plugging it into different outlets.  I have a central vacuum system and I prefer to use this vacuum.  It is worth every cent!  I would and do recommend it to my family and friends.

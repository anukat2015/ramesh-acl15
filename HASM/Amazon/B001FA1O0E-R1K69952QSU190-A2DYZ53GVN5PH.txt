Title: My upgrade from a 1gb Nano...
Content:
This toy is so cool... I have a 1g Nano which I loved and was so easy to use however quickly ran out of space for songs.. I almost bought a new nano but decided to try this and am so glad I did.. This apple product is still so easy to use, anywhere there is a wi-fi connection I can look online and check my e-mail right out of the box without installing any program or any hassle or fee.. It has its own short cut to Youtube and the quality of the picture is amazing its so clear. I loaded every Cd I have on this and still have some space left..  I think if your into top notch gadgets you can't beat this. Games, calculator, apps, stock mkt info, weather, on and on.. Oh yeah and don't forget the music the whole reason I bought it for.. It feels like a mini laptop and I found it easy to type with the on screen keyboard. I am glad I have my other Nano in case I am worried about this one getting damaged or lost, thats the only drawback I can see is that its so special that I baby it a bit where with my nano It was what it was a music player and It banged around with me working out or in the car, in the bottom of my bag... For now this one gets the special treatment but its worth it.

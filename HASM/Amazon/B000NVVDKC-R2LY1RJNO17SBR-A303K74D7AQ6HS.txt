Title: I've got a new back and I feel much better
Content:
Desiring image stablization I exchanged my original E300 back for the new 510 back. Along with IS I got many other enhancements. It's astonishing how much technology can be bought for less than $500. And the controls are much more accessible. The larger viewing screen is helpful in many ways. I am extremely pleased.

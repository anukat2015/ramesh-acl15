Title: Finally, A Real "Old School", Vacuum Cleaner!
Content:
The vast majority of vacuums on the market today are poor substitutes for the "old school" models that gained fame in the 1950's and 60's. Mostly Plastic, cheaply made, and never doing the job good enough, most vacuums today do just enough to get by. This unit by Metropolitan not only pays homage to those legendary cannister vacs of the 1950's, but it actually cleans like them! This vac actually is powerful enough, to suck up, anything it touches, so it not only picks up the deepest dirt, and dust, but if you're not careful, it'll also devour socks, coins, paper, and other small items! This is the type of concentrated, sustained, sucking power, lacking in most contemporary units. With it's mulitiple filtration, quiet operation, and lightweight, this vacuum is a joy to operate. The need to buy filters and bags may be construed as a negative, but in reality, it's a reasonable trade-off, for the true "old school" cleaning power, this unit delivers.

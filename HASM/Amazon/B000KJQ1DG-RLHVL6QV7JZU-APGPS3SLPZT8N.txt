Title: Awesome starter camera
Content:
I have been shooting with a DSLR for almost a year and the first 10 months were with the Nikon D40.  This camera is a great starter camera.  It is really easy to learn on, and works great for those who just want to shoot on auto.  Plus you can't beat the price!
I recently updated to the nikon d80, and wish I had my D40 back.  The D80 underexposes everything.  
The reason I got rid of my D40 was because there were only 3 focusing points, and it can't auto focus with some lenses.  I really wanted the Nikkor 50mm 1.8 and it wouldn't auto focus with the D40.
I would buy the D40 again and hold on to it until I could afford the D300 if I were to do it all again.
Also, the resale price was good.  I bought this camera for a really good deal at $450 almost a year ago and sold it recently for $400.  That is only a $50 loss for a whole year worth of pictures- Awesome!

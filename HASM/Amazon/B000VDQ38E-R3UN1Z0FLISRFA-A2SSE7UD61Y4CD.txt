Title: This is well worth the money
Content:
I just got my Bissell two days ago and tried it out today.  I had just vacuumed with my Oreck a couple of days ago, and the Bissell picked up so much dirt and pet hair (I have 2 cats) that it had to be emptied 3 times before I was done.  It is so easy to empty that I couldn't believe it!Amazing!  
It was a little difficult to assemble, but well worth the time.  It is a little on the heavy side, but if it will do this good a job, it is so worth it, compared to the Oreck!!

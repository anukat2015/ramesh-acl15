Title: TERRIFFIC!
Content:
I bought this for my husband to use at the gym.  It is an awesome little player and I will be ordering one for myself.  It's easy to use and has terriffic sound quality.  For a clip player, there's no need to spend $30 to $30 more on an Ipod Shuffle - this little player can't be beat!

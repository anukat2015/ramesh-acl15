Title: Great little radiator
Content:
This heater works wonderfully, is a great compact size, and has some great features (three different power levels, a thermostat, and a timer). 
I use it in my 15x15 Master bedroom, which is a cold-spot in my house. The timer feature is great! I just set it to come on about an hour before bedtime, and by bedtime it is warm and toasty. Then I turn down the power to medium and set the thermostat to maintain the temperature. The first few nights is got so hot that we had to throw off the covers and open the door, then I got the temperature down to a science and it has been wonderful. It is set to automatically turn off about a half hour after we get up.
The surface gets hot enough to give you a good burn so be careful not to touch.  It also took several uses before the smelly off-gassing stopped,. Plug it in and turn it on and let it run in a garage or well-ventilated basement the first few uses. Once it stops stinking, it is a great little heater.

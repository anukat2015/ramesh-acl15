Title: So-So Vacuum
Content:
I have not found the vacuum bags to fill so quickly.  We bought the vacuum in August and we are still using the 2nd bag.  We do vacuum every few days, and it is usually lots of food crumbs since I have two small kids.  This has caused the bag to get kind of stinky, so I am going to try the s-bag anti-odor bags next time.    
I was very disappointed that the power on/off switch on the handle does not work by itself.  You first have to turn the power on with your foot on the canister, and then push the handle switch when using the power head for carpets.  You can leave the switch on, so all you have to do is turn the power on the canister, but there is not the convience of it being fully functioning on the handle.  
I also do not like the bare floor brush.  It is very wide so it is hard to manuever and my wrist gets sore!  Also, the bristles are very long, so the brush does not get close enough to the floor.  
I was surprised at how much the vacuum weighs.  The canister alone is not that heavy, but, the power head is as heavy (or heavier) than the canister.  I was hoping it would be more light weight.  
On a positive note, the suction is good!

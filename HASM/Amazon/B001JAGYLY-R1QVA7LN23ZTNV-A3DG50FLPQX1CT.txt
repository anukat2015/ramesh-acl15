Title: Returning it after 2 weeks of use
Content:
Everything was going great with this vacuum. I loved the suction, loved the bagless feature, loved how it looked.  This morning I was vacuuming my dining room rug when all of a sudden I looked down and noticed that the cyclonic thing that's usually spinning around was not.  Next, the rotating brush/carpet attachment wouldn't turn on anymore.  I tried and tried to get these things working again to no avail!  Great at first but now I have to go all the way back to where I bought it to return it AND find a new vacuum.  No fun!

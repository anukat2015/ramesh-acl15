Title: MR COFFEE--What a Surprise!!!
Content:
My 2 year old, very expensive, Gaggia died on the 4th of July!  I was so mad, I need my 2 cups of cappuccino everyday.  So I got in my car and drove to the Starbucks at Target, only place open close to me, to get my morning fix.  I thought while I was there I would see what Target had to offer in cappuccino machines---find something cheap to get me through then give it to my daughter.  I had no idea that Mr. Coffee had an espresso machine and I thought what the heck, it was a pump system and I have had a regular Mr. Coffee machine for over 10 years now, I do not drink regular coffee, I keep it for company, and I never had a problem with that.  I was so surprised when I brewed my first cup, the crema was very nice and the forthing system was wonderful.  It was so easy to use and so much quicker than any Gaggia I have had.  I always thought you had to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good working machine, boy was I wrong.  Over the past 17 years I have had 3 or 4 Gaggia's and I am so surprised how far home espresso/cappuccino machines have come.  I will be keeping this machine and saving my money!  I do agree with other reviews, you do not need the rubber tip and the single dermitass is too small.  So far I am really happy with this machine, I know it has only been a few days, but 6 cups later I am still happy with my purchase!!

Title: Love this coffee maker!
Content:
This has become one of my favorite things!  I considered getting an instant hot water unit for under my sink because I like to drink tea.  However, this unit is so great, I can make tea with my own teabags, getting hot water at any time, and I've been able to go back to drinking decaf coffee during the day without having to brew a pot.  It's just a great little invention and it works just as it says it will. I don't mind the noise that others have mentioned.  It only lasts a few seconds.

Title: Great heating option
Content:
Bought this stove because it was a great size for our living room - not too big and it gave enough heat to warm that room and the hall. As an added benefit, my 6 year old is glad that Santa now has a "fireplace" to come to our house.:)  The only thing I don't like are the "coals and logs".  They really don't look too real.  Someone had mentioned that they colored the logs darker on another stove and that is a good idea but this stove doesn't open from the front so you have to wait until you change the bulb from the back. Simple on and off switch for the fire and the heat - no temperature control.  Good product for the money but if you want a super stove that is not too much bigger, choose the CS3311.  Very pretty log placement and really looks like a fire.  Also has the remote that you can press and turn the stove on and off.  If you can spend the extra $50 approximately, choose the CS3311.  I can understand how people choose one for each room.  I have bought three but my favorite has the remote and pretty "fire".

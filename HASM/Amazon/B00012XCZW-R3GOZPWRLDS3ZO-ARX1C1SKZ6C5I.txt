Title: Bunn NHB Professional Home Brewer
Content:
AWESME! This is the third Bunn coffee brewer we have owned, the first two lasted for several years and were replaced only to upgrade. I purchased a Cuisinart 1200 Programmable 12 cup brewer(purchased for reputation and style) to replace the second Bunn...what a mistake. If the Cuisinart decanter is not placed perfectly under the cone filter, the water will back up and overflow. What a mess! Not so with the Bunn. As for programmable...what's 3 minutes! The Bunn makes perfect coffee every time and the taste is smooth and never bitter as with cone and/or slow dripping brewers. We had reached the point where coffee was no longer appealing and pretty much avoided it; now we are enjoying it again. Bunn is definitely our choice!

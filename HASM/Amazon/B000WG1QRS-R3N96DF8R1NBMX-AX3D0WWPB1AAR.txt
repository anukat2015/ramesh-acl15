Title: Very good player with a few issues
Content:
The sound is great.  The size is good; small.  The interface is good.  The touchpad/control works pretty good, but when trying to press the center to 'enter' it's easy to press left, right, up, or down instead.  The touch scroll seems to work fine.  In order to download files to the zune you have to download software from Microsoft.  The software works fine.

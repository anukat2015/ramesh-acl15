Title: Great little vac- good for pets/hardwood floors- light!
Content:
As a regular amazon customer I am always reading reviews and basing purchases on what the "real world" says most often than what the product description says. I bought my little dirt devil b/c my bigger dirt devil (jaguar I think- regular vac) was getting old and wouldnt stand upright on its own anymore. I use my vacs mainly and only for vaccuuming up dog hair throughout my small condo (wood floors). This little vac is so light and easy to maneuver and great for getting all the "tumbleweeds" of dog hair in my home. I have 2 german shepherds & 1 miniature australian shepherd. That equals a lot of hair! And I use my vac frequently. So far so good, no complaints. Easy to maneuver, easy to empty/clean. Takes up minimal space which is extremely important. Since my apt is mainly wood floors, with just one large area rug, this vac does the job just fine. When I move into a home with more carpet, I will plan to buy a bigger/regular vac for that. But for now this is just great! Great buy for the price!

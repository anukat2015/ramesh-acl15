Title: How is it possible that this vacuum gets such good reviews???
Content:
Like many of the other reviewers, I also spent a lot of time choosing this vacuum.  I chose it primarily because of its Consumer Reports rating and reviews from other owners.  I also thought paying so much for a vacuum would mean it was a quality product.  HUGE MISTAKE!
PROS:  Decent suction and cleaning on regular carpet (but not as amazing as I was lead to believe).  Lightweight.  Nice looking.
CONS:  Does NOT clean well on hard surfaces or very low pile carpet.  Picks up dust and pet hair fairly well, but doesn't easily pick up "heavier" dirt which gets tracked in by kids and pets.  Power brushroll strongly propells itself forward which seems cool at first, but you have to use strength to pull it back in the typical back and forth vacuuming motion which gets pretty tiring after any length of time and makes it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.  Very flimsy plastic construction.  And switching between brushroll and floor tool for hard and carpeted surfaces is a real pain if you have multiple transistions between rooms.
I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone, especially not for the price.

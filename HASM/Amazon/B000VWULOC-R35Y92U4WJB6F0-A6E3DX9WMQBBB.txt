Title: Good for the money
Content:
I've been using this tower heater/fan since October and I've had a fairly good experience. It's basically the taller version of the "SPT SH-1508 Tower Ceramic Heater with Ionizer." The SH-1508 was too short for my tall bed and adding an extra foot to the height in the SH-1509 made is ideal. It heats up my mid size room pretty well. 
When I first got this product it looked like it was in good condition (the box definitely wasn't though). But it seems that there's a little bit of blurred area on the front inside of the remote control signal receptor. But that area is a black background with a red light covered by the transparent plastic so I can't really tell the blurred plastic cover anymore unless I look closely. 
The fan was very quiet when I first got it. I am a very light sleeper and even the smallest sounds can wake me up, and I slept through fine when the heater went off. However, about a couple weeks ago, I noticed that the fan, when especially oscillating, makes a vibrating noise. Pretty unfortunate since it makes the fan noisey now - I might have to take it apart to see if anything came loose.
Besides those two things, I really have no complaints except the shape of the heater itself. It's not symmetrical as I expect most products to be. It's really not a big deal but it might bother the odd ones like myself.
PROS:
- Tall
- Multiple settings: High, Low, Fan (although very week) and Auto (I always use this setting - heater is set to go off when the adjustable temperature is reached)
- Quiet
- Remote control - this is one of the best features
- Neat and clear blue screen
- Space-efficient
CONS:
- Wasn't in 100% prestine condition when I first got it.
- Something came loose and now makes a vibrating noise only after 2 months of use.
- Fan is weak - I can't feel any cool air unless I'm directly in front of it.
Overall, I would recommend that other people who don't want a stubby heater like the SH-1508 should get the SH-1509. It's pretty much the same fan around the same price but taller. If it weren't for the vibrating noise that suddenly happened, I'd give it five stars.

Title: New to DSLRs, this is a great camera
Content:
Five minutes after opening the box, I was taking pictures of my family. You can set the camera to auto-mode (where the camera sets everything for you, aperture, shutter speed and ISO) and snap off some shots, or you can adjust everything yourself for that perfect effect. 
Instead of the stock lens that came with the kit, I got the same version only with Image Stablization (IS), so I can't comment on the stock lens. So far I've taken some very good pictures of my family and of landscapes. Using the 'sports' mode, I was able to capture some very fast motion pictures, and they turned out very sharp and clear.
I was also worried that my 1GB compact flash card would not be enough, but in large (highest quality JPG mode, the best quality besides RAW) I can get 180-200+ pictures on one card, and they transfer very fast every evening. 
The included strap is very comfortable, thick enough to not dig into the back of my neck, but light enough where it doesn't feel like I've got a noose around my neck.
Once I registered the camera on Canon's website, I was sent an email with a 'private' support email address for Canon, which I have not (thankfully) had to use yet. That was a nice addition to the package.
As a DSLR beginner, this is a great camera to learn on, but I realize that as my skill grows, this camera can scale with me due to its excellent quality (10.1 Megapixels) and the accessories is where I'll focus future purchases on (ie Speedlite flash, better lenses, battery grip, etc.) but I can tell already that the camera will probably be the same for a while, and I love it.

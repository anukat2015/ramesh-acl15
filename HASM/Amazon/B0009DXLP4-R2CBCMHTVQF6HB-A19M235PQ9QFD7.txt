Title: Spend The Extra Money!
Content:
I've had my Miele vac for several years now and am almost completely satisfied with it. Great power -- it really DOES clean very effectively, is much quieter than most vacuums, has great accessories, a very powerful powerhead for carpet cleaning, and it's easy to use. To top it all off, the Miele is downright pretty!
The filters are great, it's much cleaner internally than most vacs, and the vacuum cleaner bags can be removed without spewing dust all around. Absolutely the only drawbacks I find with this cleaner are its lack of a power switch on the metal wand and awkward upright storage. If you buy the next level up, I think even those flaws are absent, but I didn't have the money to buy the more expensive model at the time. Other than that, I would buy it again tomorrow. It's a terrific cleaner and a whole lot better than any other cleaner I've ever owned (that would be about ten different cleaners over the years). Well worth the money.

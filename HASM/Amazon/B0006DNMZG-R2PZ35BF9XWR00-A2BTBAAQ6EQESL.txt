Title: Does what I need it to
Content:
This little unit works very well in my bedroom and heats up very quickly just on the low setting. In the living room I've used it on the high setting and it also works pretty quickly. I use this unit when I am the only one who is cold and don't want to use the central heat. I really like the option to use 360/ front function and the thermostat capability. As per the directions, you turn on the unit with the thermostat on full heat and when the temperature is as hot as you want you slowly turn it down until the unit clicks off. Then it will automatically shut on and off to keep that temperature. My only complaint, which is why I didn't rate the unit 5 stars, is that it is too noisy for me. I mostly wanted this unit for nighttime use and when the unit clicks on and off it wakes me up.

Title: Great value for price range
Content:
I have had this Hoover for almost one year now, and it has performed very well. I was very happy with the performance of this vacuum right out of the box. The only issue I have had is that recently the powered carpet brush is sometimes getting stuck - I clean the bristles every couple uses, but for some reason that has not fixed it. I took apart the powered brush to clean inside, and the belt was fine (unresolved). You can get reduced suction when the cup filter gets covered with dirt - there is a small tool included that facilitates cleaning the filter. The vacuum is easy to use, pick-up and move around and has a good cord length (plus it's retractable so no cord mess). It seems rugged enough as I have banged it into things a number of times. I love the versatility of the various attachments and ability to quickly switch to another tool of function. The suction power on this vacuum is very good, I rarely even use the highest power. I have a Golden Retriever so it's hair hair everywhere!... until I get out the Hoover. I was considering Dyson and Electrolux but am happy with the money saved and performance of this vacuum. I'd give it 5 stars if I could figure out the issue with the power brush getting stuck from time to time.

Title: Great for hard wood floors and tile!  (Not for carpet)
Content:
The perfect vacuum in this price range for hardwood floors and tile.  Great design, long power cord, light (so it's easy to actually carry around, vs. dragging on the floor).  Comes with handy attachments for getting into nooks and crannies.Although I rated it 5 stars, this is NOT the vacuum for you if you have rugs or carpet.  There is no &quot;spinning brush&quot; on this vacuum, so moving it across carpet is difficult and won't clean nearly as well as a vacuum designed for that purpose.  Otherwise, I couldn't be happier with it.

Title: Grab it if you get it cheap
Content:
I think the laptop is pretty good for price. I have been using this laptop for about a year and I am really happy with it. I got a bunch of discounts when I bought it (i.e. corporate and thanksgiving discount), and I got it for around $570 brand new. 
Pros:
- Beautiful picture quality
- The keyboard feels great
- Tons of usb port
- HDMI
- Flash memory card slot
- Touch sensitive media control
Cons:
- Very heavy and bulky
- Not good deal if you have to pay more than $650 USD to get a new one

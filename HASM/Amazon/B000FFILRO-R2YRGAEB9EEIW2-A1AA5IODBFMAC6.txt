Title: REALLY AWESOME COFFEE MAKER
Content:
I have been looking for a new coffee maker and went to consumer reports, Amazon, Qvc, HSN, and read all the reviews.
So this is the one I picked, and I am so blessed that I picked this coffee maker, on a score from 1 to 10 I give it a big 10. Coffee is brewed hot; we grind our own coffee beans, as we do not buy coffee out in the coffee shops. What we do buy is the best coffee beans we like, Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain Yankee Doodle, Coffee by Design here in Maine.
If you want a good cup of coffee buy this unit, and you will not be sorry. Remember that when you go out to the coffee shops and pay $2.08 for a large, that is $64.20 a month for just one cup of coffee a day, think of the nice coffee maker you could have, and the best beans ground at home. We also have the Bunn coffee grinder, that we have had for three years now.
God Bless,

Title: Easy installation, save $$!!
Content:
This is worth every penny I spent, our old one was getting moody, sometimes it refuses to corporate. This one was very simple to install, the instructions are clear as crystal. You don't have to be very handy to do it.
My only complain is that there is not a battery cover under the main batter, when you have to lift it up for setting adjustment, the batteries are quite unsightly. but it's not a big deal. another thing is when the LED is lite up, there is a high pitch beep sound until the LED goes off, annoying but tolerable.
Overall, it saved me a lot of money in electric bill (i have a 2 bedroom house around 1200 sqft). Definately worth the investment, and it helps save the environment!

Title: ipod nano 4th gen
Content:
before i got this i had an ipod shuffle and this is a big upgrade for me. so far i love it. great design, light weight, and thin! video and pics look great on it. great sound quality. but as with any kind of electronic device there are things that make you think "wow, that makes no sense at all. why don't they just make it do this or that?" but there are many features that do make sense and are quite useful. one of the games that comes with it makes use of the accelerometer and is pretty fun. shake to shuffle is a good feature. but if u have a 3rd gen nano, don't switch to this cause the benefits are not worth the cost.

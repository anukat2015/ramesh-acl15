Title: Loving It!!
Content:
I've had my Zune for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it. My iPod owning friends are jelous and I love how pretty the entire experience of listening to stuff on the Zune is. I love album art so I love that its featured nicely on the Zune now playing screen, not just a tiny thumbnail like most mp3 players. The radio feature is great for those days when you can't seem to find anything you want to listen to. I haven't used the video feature much yet but from watching the preloaded ones it seems great too. My only complaint is that my hundred or so songs that I had downloaded with Yahoo Music won't work on the Zune, but thats the fault of Yahoo more than the makers of the Zune (theres a reason Yahoo's music store is gone now)
overall I HIGHLY recommend it!!!

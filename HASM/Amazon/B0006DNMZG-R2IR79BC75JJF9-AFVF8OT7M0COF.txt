Title: Tricky to get used to, random clicky noises?
Content:
My room (13' x 16') does not warm up unless I have the thing blasting. Once it is warmed up, however, I can set it lower and it maintains the temperature very well. It also has that nice directional or omni-directional feature. It also got good ratings from consumer reports last year. My question is: Where is the knock-over safety switch? Almost all of their topped reviewed products had them, this one does not.... 
For some reason on the lower settings when it would frequently turn on/off it would make an odd click and clack noise. I believe it to be the fan acting a bit odd. I thought it was perhaps a voltage regulation issue, who knows? It seems better now, and never had much problems on the higher settings.

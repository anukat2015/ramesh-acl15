Title: It came used and broken
Content:
The heater was bought new, it came used and broken. The cord was loosely wrapped not from the factory. Heater also came with human hair on the bottom of the unit, looks like it was used in a bathroom. Had a screw missing from inside the grill and it rattles. I'm one mad customer at Amazon.

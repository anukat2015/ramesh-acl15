Title: Mr Heater Portable Buddy 9000 Review
Content:
I purchased this heater to use in a tent and small trailer when camping on chilly nights.
It works really well and once you have the space heated I can turn it to low or off.
I use it with the one lb propane bottles and since I don't use the heater for long periods of time that works well for me.

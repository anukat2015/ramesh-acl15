Title: WARNING Price gouging and miss-leading ship time: Shipping Estimate 1-4 Weeks from 11/2/09
Content:
Hey everyone,
I pre-ordered this Camera a few weeks ago, they kept moving back the estimated stock date. Then I checked it today and it says estimated delivery tomorrow.
They've since started selling from an alternate Amazon vendor at $200 more than MSRP. I thought that a bit strange, seeing as how I had not received a shipping notice, and they were already selling it from an alternate source.
I contacted Amazon customer service directly and was told "Their vendor had not filled amazons order yet, and they had not had the chance to update the availability listed on the item's page."
Might have been nice if they had alerted me to this "minor fact" instead of BSing me so they could keep their high ticket sale.
Do your selves a favor; If you live in any state besides NY order from B and H photo. No sales tax, they have great customer service, and reasonable prices. (In this case: MSRP. Imagine that.)
I use Amazon constantly, and rarely have problems but this is a pretty screw up. If I had not looked into this issue, It could have cost my company thousands of dollars in lost revenue as I needed this Camera today. I figured others may find this information useful.
I rated 5 Stars with the intention of revising it in the future, because I have no doubts about the performance vs price ratio on this Camera. It gives Prosumer a whole new meaning. I will update my review in a few weeks if I'm wrong.
Take care everyone.

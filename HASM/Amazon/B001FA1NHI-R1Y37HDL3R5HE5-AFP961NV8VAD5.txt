Title: So far, Excellent!
Content:
Very excited when this came in the mail. I've had it for about two weeks now and I love it. Sound quality is great, and battery lasts a while too. The battery does drain somewhat quickly though when you are watching movies or playing games on it. Also, very sturdy. The only thing I recommend doing is getting a case at the same time as the nano. The screen is very sensitive to smudges and the like. 
Again, overall: excellent.

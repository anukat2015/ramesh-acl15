Title: The honeymoon's over...
Content:
When we first picked up this vacuum, it seemed promising. The detachable cannister would be great on the stairs, the pet brush would let us easily pick up the cat that our three cats left on the couch and curtains, and the carpet height adjustment would cover the fact that some rugs are thicker than others. And out of the box, it did. I was happy. 
Six months later...I want to put the thing on craigslist for $20 and just get it out of here. The pet brush is horribly designed. It clogs up with hair extremely easily. I spent 20 minutes pulling it apart, removing all the hair that had gotten caught up on the axle, and putting it back together. After 5 minutes of use, the brush stopped spinning again. The suction the vacuum generates is not enough to keep the brush spinning; our other vacuum does it fine. The brush on the floor vacuum only spins when the upright is not locked into the upright postion. Doesn't sound like a problem... unless you've ever tried to vacuum stairs. (Don't beleive me? Go ahead, take out your vacuum and try to vacuum the stairs without the upright being locked.)
The dust cup does come out easily. The filters are easy to clean. It sucks a ton of junk up off our carpets. The adjustable height is great. But the two design oversights are so frustrating that I would have second thoughts about buying another Bissell product.

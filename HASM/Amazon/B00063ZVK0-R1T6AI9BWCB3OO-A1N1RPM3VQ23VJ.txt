Title: This is DVTH, not DVH - Ultimate one!
Content:
I recommend this one only. It seems to me that DVTH is an upgrade version of DVH (you can see the product number which is different) and far better than VH2. Current temp. and setting temp. is shown repeatedly with fan speed ('LO', 'HI', and 'FA'n only), and it accurately monitor and warm up the room.
Other heaters stops fan as well as the heating element when the desired temparature is reached; this one doesn't. Fan works continuously (slowly) when the temparature is reached... so that the entire room air is heated up properly. I tried Homles one, and Black and decker one, but they don't have this functionality.
I am pretty sure this fan works well esp. when there is another heat source (like ordanary apartment) but heating is not enough. I am not sure for other cases. But definitely, this guy is well worth the money (I know this is expensive). You can search hard and ask for the best price in a big online company which sells this.

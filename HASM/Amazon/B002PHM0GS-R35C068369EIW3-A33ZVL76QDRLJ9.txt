Title: You will really enjoy it!
Content:
I bought this laptop sony vaio vgn-fw510f about one mounth ago...I am really amazed by the way it lokks, because I have never imagined a laptop to look so bussiness...it's awesome...i really recomend it to everyone who needs a laptop...the screen resolution is 16:9...it's a little wierd at the beggining, but now I wouldn't change it for anything in the world!and the performances are really good... maybe the autonomy of the battery is a little small, something like two hours!but with all of this you will have the chance to have a really powerfull, fancy and performant laptop, named sony;))...thank you, and excuse my english, I am from Romania:D...enjoy it!

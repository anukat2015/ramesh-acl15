Title: Disappointed
Content:
I purchased this vacuum after doing a lot of research. I was needing to replace my Kenmore Progressive Canister, which is falling apart after 6 years of use. I did not want another Kenmore because I had trouble finding the replacement filters, both in Sears and online. The pros: the Electrolux oxygen was easy to assemble, compact, and has pretty good suction (although I only used it once). The cons: I had to give it one start for quality. The attachments (other than the motorized brush head) do not fit on securely. There are two on board attachments which kept falling off. The other attachments have no place to be stored. The cord is ridiculously short compared to my old Kenmore canister...I have a 2200 sq.ft. home and could not even vacuum my entire living room without moving the cord to another outlet!!! Also, the canister seems to have a mind of it's own...it would keep rolling when I stopped(on my wood floors) and doesn't turn very easily. The wand is adjustable which is a great feature, but mine wouldn't stay engaged in one position. Really annoying when you are trying to push it back and forth! I keep accidently pushing the controls on the hand portion of the vacuum, turning it off. I was so excited to get my new vacuum, but was extremely disappointed after using it. I am hoping it doesn't cost a fortune to send back because I'm not keeping it!

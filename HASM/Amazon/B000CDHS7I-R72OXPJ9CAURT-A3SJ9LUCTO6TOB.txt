Title: Krups FMF 5 - Nice looking but bad coffee
Content:
We bought the Krups FMF5 because it looked nice and it had a thermal carafe.  We are big fans of Green Mountain coffee and were anxious to see how it tasted in a deluxe coffee maker.  We previously owned the Gevalia that they give away when you order their coffee.  Unfortunately, the freebie from Gevalia brewed a much better tasting cup of coffee.  We tried the Krups for a week, constantly adjusting the amount of coffee, playing with the 1-3 cup brew feature - we even took out the water filter, but nothing really improved the taste of the coffee.  The more coffee we used, the more bitter it tasted.  If we didn't use enough, it had no flavor.  Aside from the bad coffee, the carafe is not very friendly for pouring.  You have to turn it completely upside down to get out the last cup.  The last criticism I have is that the programming feature is not easy to set.  If you don't hold the button down, it changes from hours to minutes.  If you do hold the button down, it flies through the numbers too quickly.  Bottom line, the only good thing I can say about this coffee maker is that it looks nice - especially if you own stainless appliances.  But that is hardly worth the $100.  We are returning it tomorrow and will pick up either a Cuisanart or a Braun.  After all, it is ALL ABOUT THE COFFEE!

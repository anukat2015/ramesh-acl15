Title: Great Coffemaker!!!!
Content:
This coffeemaker is wonderful.  We have used it everyday since we purchased it three weeks ago and we LOVE it.  Before this one....we had the Cuisinart 12-cup programmable pot with the push down handle and it was AWFUL.  It leaked everywhere and would not start on several occasions.  We went with this pot due to the excellent reviews and we are very impressed with it.  The coffee tastes great, takes only minutes to brew, and stays hot for as long as you want it.  We love being able to control the temp of the coffee and are super happy we bought this pot!

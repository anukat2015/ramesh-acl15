Title: Finally a MAC that Can Run Windows
Content:
First, it is the way a computer should have been designed. Modern, fast, sleek, and did I say fast?
Everything you want in a MAC, more bells and whistles that the older OS 8 and 9.
Plus now you can run any costly Windows programs without buying special MAC versions such as Adobe CS Suite ($1300)!
I love it. And with WiFi built in, I'll use it more and more.
The 17 inch version is bright and clear. great for movies too. And if you own an iPod, the transfer of files is so easy.
Amazon is a great place to do business with as well. Many confirmation e-mails, good shipping. No problems at all.

Title: difficult to use
Content:
We have had this maker for over a year and could not really recommed it.  The grinder is VERY loud, and can be heard all through the house, to the dismay of those sho do not have to get up early, this can be turned off, but that sort of defeats the purpose. The lid to the pot is very hard to get off and gets harder as time goes on, my wife now has to get me to remove the lid.  Cleaning it is another chore, the coffee compartment has to me very clean and very dry or the coffee sticks and does not go to the filter.  I am about ready tp go back to a $30.00 Mr Coffee!

Title: broke after a year
Content:
well, they must've read the previous comments about the clock running slow because my clock runs consistently fast! I loved being able to program the coffee so it was brewed when I got up...but after a year of heavy use it has developed problems heating the water & brewing the coffee...it takes about 15 minutes to heat the water to boiling, then it gurgles & sputters & steams for the next 15 minutes while it tries to brew - I put in the amount of water for 4+ cups & am lucky to have it brew almost 3 cups. It was great while it lasted but I'm looking for a different brand to try...I don't think this coffee maker was made to handle the heavy daily use that I gave it.

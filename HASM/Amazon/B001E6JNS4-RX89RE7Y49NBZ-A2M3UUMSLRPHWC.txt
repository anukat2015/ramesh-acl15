Title: Great Value
Content:
I had been contemplating buying an SLR camera for a while, but my main deterrent was the price. I finally found this great value, and I bought it right away. This camera goes for $600+ at retail stores without any accessories. I don't have any complaints since I got the camera. It works great, and is just what I expected. Great camera for anyone that like photography, whether you are a beginner or experienced photographer.

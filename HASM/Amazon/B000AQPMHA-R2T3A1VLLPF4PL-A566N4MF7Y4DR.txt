Title: $.50 a cup for too little coffee
Content:
I love the convenience of the machine and the speed of the coffee being produced.  I DON'T LIKE that at best I can get the coffee for $.50 per cup--and that's the very best price I've found, i.e. $9 for 18 of the k-cups.  The second I DON'T LIKE is that the amounts of coffee produced--the two choices, regular cup and large cup--are relatively small amounts per mug.  
Other than that, I love the convenience.  The coffee isn't spectacular, but it's fast, simple, no mess to clean up, and the coffee is okay.  Just would have liked the coffee cheaper and the amount produced per mug, greater.  Leaving price and quantity aside this would have been 4 stars, the missing star simply caused by the k-cup coffee not tasting better, irrespective of the manufacturer (Paul Newman, Emeril, etc.)
If you spend some more money and buy them separately, there are "k-cup" filters/containers that are far more sound, ecologically.  They allow you to put your own ground coffee into the filter and then put it in the Keurig.  Clearly the $.50 per cup price will go down dramatically.  I haven't tried it yet, but I have it on order.  You'll find that the pricing for them is all over the place and delivery charges can equal the cost of the filter.  Boo!!!!  I look forward to not having to be criticized by my children for environmental waste and destruction--those k-cups really pile up and just go into the landfill.

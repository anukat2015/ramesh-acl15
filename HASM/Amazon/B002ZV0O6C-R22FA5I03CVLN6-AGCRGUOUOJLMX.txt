Title: Worst Purchase of My Life
Content:
Do not even consider buying this heater. It is terrible in so many ways. Online, this product looks to be sleek and modern looking, but when it arrived it looks like a hunk of tin from the 1970's. Second, the triple combo of purifier, humidifier, and heater sound good on paper but it was unable to handle the requests digitally. The purifier worked well, but the heater had a mind of its own. The digital thermostat was well below the actual temperature in the room, 5-8 degrees in fact. Then it would shut off at random times. The remote would not register the commands and had to be connected to the unit for it to work. When working the unit would make these sounds that could only be related to pennies in a dryer. Tried using it when sleeping, awful. If I had to buy this heater, I honestly would not pay more than $30 for it. Stay away; there is a reason why it is hard to find a 3-in-1 unit, maybe because it just isn't possible...

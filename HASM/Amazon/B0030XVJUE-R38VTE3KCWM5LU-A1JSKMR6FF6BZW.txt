Title: Excellent All Around Performer
Content:
Good:
Core i7 Intel chip
Doesnt have a lot of "Bloatware" to bother you
Snappy and speedy
Good amount of space on the harddrive 
Relatively quiet even when the fans are spinning
Lightweight for the kind of power it punches
Has a num-pad
Screen is very bright thanks to the LED lighting
Bad:
Fingerprint Magnet on the keyboard, outer shell and even on the handrests
Depending what you do, it can get pretty hot
Also Depending what you use the laptop for, the battery life can get cut short, but thats with any laptop really.
This laptop is a pretty versitile laptop that can appease the gamer, power user, or even a web surfer.  It is a really sleek looking laptop and it doesnt scream out like the alienware laptops or dell XPS.  The only thing that brings attention to the laptop is the light it has on the outerside lid.  It lights up the HP logo, which some people will like or some wont.  The laptop keyboard is kind of squished because they added a numpad, but coming from a 17" laptop with no keypad, this was a welcomed addition.  The LED lit screen is amazing.  Everything comes out crisp and bright especially since the graphics are being run on a dedicated nvidia m230 card. This card helps out with more of the demanding resources when playing a PC game, and will drop the battery life.

Title: great vac for a pet and kid heavy house
Content:
We have been a Dyson Animal household and quite happy, but our housekeeper hated the upright.  We needed a small cannister unit that would be good with the debris left behind by two large dogs, a cat and 5 year old twins.  The S3765-040 was a great value.  It does the job with dog hair and is very maneuverable.

Title: D70S with 18-135 lens
Content:
I bought the D70S body and 18-135 mm lens separately.  This is roughly $200 cheaper than the D80 18-135 mm kit.  I am very happy with the D70S. Well built, solid construction.  Do take advantage of the manual modes - extensive metering and focusing options allow great flexibility in taking photos in difficult situations.  Camera is very quick on power up and shooting.  
A friend who recently purchased a Canon XTi with the 18-55 mm kit lens felt the D70s and 18-135 combo was a better buy after had a chance to try my Nikon out.  
Pluses:
- Solid construction.
- Quick.
- The D70S and 18-135mm make a great package for less then the D80.
Minuses:
- Convoluted manual.
- Only 6 megapixel.  Only an issue if you print enlargements or blow-up images a lot.  Otherwise pictures look great on a monitor and the file sizes are reasonable.

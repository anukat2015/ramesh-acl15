Title: Buyers Beware!
Content:
The only good thing about the Zune is the amount of gigs for the price.  The software will prompt you to update which will mess up your music library.  You can find the fix on the forum, but it is a lot of work to fix. Many of the Zune owners including myself have had trouble with the players resetting during listening.  There is no fix yet for this.  There are many types of issues with the Zune and its all models not just this one.  I honestly wish I had bought an IPOD.  If there is no resetting fix by next year I am buying an IPOD. Sorry Zune, I wanted to like you.

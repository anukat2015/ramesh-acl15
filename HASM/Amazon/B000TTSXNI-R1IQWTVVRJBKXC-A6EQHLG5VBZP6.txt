Title: WOW...what a difference!
Content:
I've lived in a townhouse for 11 years with 2 electric, in-wall space heaters in the basement.  I spend a lot of time down here because that's where my home office is, treadmill, TV, computer, washer/dryer, and 1 bed.  
The in-wall units are noisy and $$$$$$$$$$$$ to run in the winter months.  An HVAC tech was here a few months ago for another issue.  He's the one who told me about these electric space heaters.  I did a little research online and found that this LASKO heater had a 4½ star rating, so I bought one.  I've had it plugged in for only a few minutes and the basement is warmer already!  It's so much QUIETER than the old in-wall space heaters.  I don't even know it's on.  It's got a small remote, too.  It's got all the bells and whistles on it, too.  And for only $[...], what more could I ask for?
I would highly recommend this heater to anybody who wants a quiet unit that heats up the room.  I'll be anxious to see how it helps the electric bill, too.  For years, my winter electric bill has looked like the National Debt, and that's with only 1 heater running.  I almost tapped out the first time I ran both heaters and got the electric bill.  It's still high with only 1 heater, but not as bad as running both of them.  I'll be anxious to see how this new LASKO heater helps the electric bill.  I'm sure it's a much more efficient heater.
I'm even thinking about one for the upstairs, too.  I didn't see this one before.  It looks good and is the same price, too.

Title: Does a mostly good job
Content:
I really like the Mr Coffee Simply Brew.  I have had mine for over a year and use it most every day.  I chose it because it had the feature to use your own coffee.  The trick I have found it to use course ground coffee.  
At first I was very disappointed when I found the pods to make light brown water (very weak coffee) and regular ground coffee to come out sludge (from all the residue).  For a while I used a paper filter and was very pleased with the result but there was an extra step (I know lazy but I bought this because it was supposed to be "simple").  Anyway, once I started to use course ground coffee everything has been great.  I get good, hot, coffee every time.  Now I can say that I love this coffee maker.  
You can get course ground coffee using the coffee grinder at your grocery store.

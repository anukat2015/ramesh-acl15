Title: What a music player and service should be!!!
Content:
I hope and pray that MS doesn't bail on the Zune. The Zune 120 combined with the Zune Pass is awesome. I cannot believe the difficulty in getting non-Zune owners to "get it" when you present the option to them. I've owned several iPods, and this is so much better it's not really even a competition. The newest Zune software rocks. The player itself is gorgeous and I like the interface far better than iPod. Hang in there, MS! The Zune community is a strong one... give it some time to spread the word.

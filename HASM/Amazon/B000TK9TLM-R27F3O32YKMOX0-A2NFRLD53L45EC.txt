Title: The reviews are pretty accurate
Content:
I bought this item based largely on the positive feedback reviews, and I feel they are pretty accurate. The unit is very effective, reasonably quiet, and a great value for the price. Other than the light showing the unit is powered, there is no glow, and only a slight hum from the motor as it operates. I am very pleased with it's performance.

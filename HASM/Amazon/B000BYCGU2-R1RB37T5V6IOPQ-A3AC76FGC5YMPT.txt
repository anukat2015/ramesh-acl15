Title: Well worth the money!
Content:
Don't be put off by what you think may be the high cost of this coffee maker. The Capresso MT-500 is worth every penny.  It will brew a full pot (10 cups) of coffee about 8 minutes. It is one of the few coffee makers that actually brews using the ideal water temperature (200 - 208F) and the machine is built to last. Expect to keep this machine for a while. Highly recomended

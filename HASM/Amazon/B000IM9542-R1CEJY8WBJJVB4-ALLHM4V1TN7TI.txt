Title: very good
Content:
i'm impressed with this model. its my very 1st mp3 player (unless you count my sony mp3 disc walkman witch i got tired of) and its easy to use. plus i love the photos and voice recorder features. putting in a microSD card was no problem, so i made it up to 4GBs. a few cons, however:
-the voice recoder will only use the unit's flash card to store recordings and your computer probably won't be able to play the file (mine won't)
-battery life is short, but i bought a portable charger for it and charge it daily regardless if i use it.
-the instruction manual is so bad i wouldn't even bother to read it after 5secs. its seriously a joke how non-informative it is on the product. 
-there is no information about the warranty, witch is confusing.

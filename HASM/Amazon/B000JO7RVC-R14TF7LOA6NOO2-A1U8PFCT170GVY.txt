Title: Pretty good overall
Content:
This is my third ipod. I've gone through a 20gb normal one, and a 1st gen nano. I have also had a 30gb brown zune. The ipods were great. The itunes/ipod link is pretty much unmatched, but the ipod hardware was a little weak under heavy use. I really enjoyed my zune, it was built very solidly, but after a long fall. 
I decided to purchase a 160gb ipod to carry a good amount of music, movies, and random files. I havent even filled up 2/3 of this device. The audio quality is good, and syncing is both fast and easy. Battery life is noticiably improved over earlier models. 
Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. Since this is a new item, I cannot speak for the durability of the product, but I'm hoping a solid case and careful use will allow it to last for a long time.

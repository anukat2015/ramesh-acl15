Title: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
Content:
So I bought this lyra thinking it looked pretty cool in comparison to the IPOD, and not too expensive at the same time...but after it broke...5 times...and i had to send it all the way back to the company only for them to re-send me another model which would break within a time period of 30 days, I decided that maybe I should stick with an IPOD or ANY other mp3 player...DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH SENDING IT BACK TO THE COMPANY EVERY OTHER MONTH!!!

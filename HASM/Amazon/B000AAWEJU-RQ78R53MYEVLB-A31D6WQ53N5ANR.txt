Title: These machines are made for specific things - pick the right one
Content:
Though no site, including Miele, does a good job of presenting this, different Miele vacs are made for different floor types. For example, mainly wall to wall, wood floors and through rugs... etc. This machine is specifically for those with wood floors and area rugs. If that is what you have and you buy this machine it is FANTASTIC. I never had a cleaner house and have wasted way more than this costs on almost yearly purchases of junky cheap vacuums for the past 8 years. Suction is amazing and you can talk on the phone while using it, it is that quiet. It is also unbelievably light and easy to carry around. Beyond making my floors super clean, using attachments is great as well. The unbelievable suction has resulted in my having clean heating radiators, perhaps for the first time in this house in 98 of its 99 years, as well as stairs, corners, hard to reach places and, well, the whole house!

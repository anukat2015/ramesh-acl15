Title: Could be better.
Content:
This product serves its purpose, but it could have been built better.  It is clunky, loud and difficult to control (spray and suction).  It is not use-friendly.   One has to play with it for a nunmber of times to figure out the best way to work it.  It uses a lot of chemicals too.  It does clean my tile floors and grout though.  I am pleased with the ultimate result but so as not to lose my patience, I pay somebody else to do the actual floor-cleaning for me.   We would not buy this product again.

Title: Not that good. Read on..
Content:
Ok, after all of the fantastic reviews, I decided to get it. Since I am an owner of a husky that sheds a lot I was tired of all the hair on the furniture. 
My first impressions: this vac has some kick, yup, it does. It sucks pretty well, but thats about it. It doesn't pick up the hair very well. After reading the reviews I though it may be as easy as 123, but not really. You really have to work hard on getting the hair out, and even then, some are still left on the furniture material. I would never buy it to clean up pets hair. Maybe it is OK for small clean-up jobs around the house, but not for pets hairy mess.
Also, with the motor head, the vac dies fast, I would say 7-8 minutes tops. 
THE WORST part about this vac is the messy filter and dirt container. You have to reach inside pull the filter out first, then empty the bin. Nasty, nasty, nasty.

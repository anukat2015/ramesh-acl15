Title: In Short - It's GREAT!
Content:
I'll keep this short and sweet.  The new video playback iPod is worth the money.  It has a lot going for it - and all of it is positive.
To get to the most important point first, yes:  I downloaded an episode of DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES and watched it on the iPod.  The clarity and color were nothing short of High Definition TV quality.  Others saw it and everyone was knocked out on how sharp and clear the video is.
The rest remains just as good:  You can download your CD's onto the system; use the iTunes store to buy new songs, etc.  It's quick and easy.  And burning a CD of your favorite tunes is so effortless, that nifty feature practically makes up for the cost of the unit.  
Battery life has seriously improved as well.
The bad points?  Apple could be more generous with what they pack in the box.  First time iPod users are going to have to get a lot of the essentials as Apple really gives you nothing more than a standard set of headphones, etc.  It was disappointing when you realize that they even skimped and did not include a manual (although you can print one out courtesy of Amazon).  But, the high caliber performance more than makes up for what was not packed with the unit.  
In short, the video iPod is fantastic.

Got it for a gift. I am older so this is first "high tech" device. Works great and able to listen to all the old "classic" rock albums I have in such a small device is amazing. Only complaint is I did need some help from a 20 something to get me up and running with Itunes, could not have done this on my own. Since I have nothing to compare it with besides a cassette tape player have to give 5 stars.

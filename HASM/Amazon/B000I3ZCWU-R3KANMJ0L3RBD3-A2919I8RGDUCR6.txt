Title: Great camera at a great price.
Content:
I have been a Navy photographer for over 18 years and have used the top of the line Nikon and Canon cameras.  This is by far the simplest, user-friendly camera I have ever used.  The image quality is outstanding, as is the construction.  This is a great camera for beginners and those who are more advanced.  Remember, in the "old days" of film, it was the lens and film that made the image quality, not the camera.  Well, digital takes care of the film part of the equation.  So do yourself a favor, get this camera and save your money for a good quality lens.  The kit lens is a good start though.  A good Canon or Sigma lens will give you better quality.
  All the shooting modes give you above average quality, but the Monochrome (black and white) setting is pretty darn close to black and white film.  Add the fact that in the settings mode, you can digitally add red, yellow, orange or green filters for more effects and you have a pretty amazing camera.  Learn to use the camera and you will not regret buying it.  One item I can suggest getting is a add on battery grip.  If you have large hands or shoot a lot, the extra grip space and battery power will keep you shooting more comfortably and for longer shoots.  Amazon sells both the Optika and Canon grips.

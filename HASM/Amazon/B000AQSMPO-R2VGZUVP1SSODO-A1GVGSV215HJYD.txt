Title: Tastes wonderful
Content:
This unique machine is so easy to use, it's a no brainer BUT it's so loud when its beginning the brew that it is a drawback.  I bought one for myself & still went on to get one for my God daughter & her husband because I knew she'd love the brew.  I tried to absorb the sound by placing it on a rubber mat but it only made it worse.  Too bad.  I did contact the manufacturer & they didn't seem surprised to hear about the vibration sound.

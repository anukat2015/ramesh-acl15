Title: Great computer, horrible touchpad
Content:
I like everything about this computer except the touchpad.  The size, weight, screen, speed - everything adds up to an ideal blend of portability and power.  BUT, the touchpad and its software are the worst I have ever used.  For some reason, the manufacturer doesn't allow you to adjust general sensitivity, only palm-brush sensitivity.  As a result, the best I can achieve is something that isn't too sensitive to my wrists resting on the wrist rest but that takes some effort to get a positive click.  Paradoxically, it is prone to inadvertent dragging.   I'm giving it three stars because I like everything else so much.  Be warned though, you'll need to be patient learning how not to trigger erratic touchpad motions.

Title: Mine has worked great....
Content:
Unlike the other 2 reviewers, I had what I consider good luck with both Edgestar and Compact Appliance Co.  I got the model that is a/c + heater + dehumidifier (12,000 btu).  Ordered it directly from Compact Appliance exactly 2 years ago tomorrow for a bedroom/bathroom comb. area.  Arrived in perfect condition w/in 2 days of order.  Easy to set up.  Cooled and heated the area (about 300 sq. ft) very comfortably, running one or the other almost every day for the past 2 years, with the exception of maybe a month or two of mild weather during that entire time.  It's a bit noisy, but no more than any other unit I've checked.  Never had a problem until today....and I'll be honest, I'm not the best at keeping the filter, etc. cleaned like I know I should.  Was cooling great this am, but when I turned it on tonight when I got home the fan runs, but compressor can't seem to kick in.  It tries every few minutes, but no success.  (The heat pump part still works fine, btw....but it's July at the moment, lol.)  Couldn't find my warranty info, so I was googling for a possible replacement and was surprised to see such negative reviews listed here, especially with such good ones elsewhere.  So....I just thought I'd share my own experience.  If I do end up having to buy a new unit, I wouldn't hesitate to get this one again.  I feel it served me well for the price and usage I got out of it.  (Still checking on warranty/possibility of repair and will update this review later if possible.)

Title: Soleus Air MS-09 Heater
Content:
I was so disappointed by the performance of this heater that I returned it. When set on "low" it hardly gave off any heat and when on "high" setting, the light is so bright and glaring but still would hardly heat up a small room. You have to sit right next to it to warm you up.  A ceramic space heater is a lot more efficient than this type of heater. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

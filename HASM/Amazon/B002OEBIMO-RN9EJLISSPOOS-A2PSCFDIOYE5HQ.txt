Title: The laptop is fine but imposible to get in touch with the ASUS
Content:
The laptop is fine it runs cooler then my HP and battery life is not quite 11 hours but long enough for my use. My complaint is I've mailed the warrenty card as directed and had it returned, the address that was printed on the warrenty card is not correct and there is no phone number in the US you can reach. My upgrade to window 7 required me to mail,fax or e-mail to  a chinese address.I have faxed then e-mail with no response from ASUS.

Title: The best money you will ever spend
Content:
WOW, WOW and WOW!!!  Purchased from Target for $149 and got a free $20 gift card.  This vac is the best ever.  I have two dark colored 9 x 12 rugs and a 115 lbs. yellow lab.  In ONE pass over ONE rug I filled the canister 2 1/2 times!!  These rugs now look new.  Before they looked like they were ready for the dumpster.  I put the vac together in 15 mins. My 11 and 13 year olds were amazed and took over the vacuuming.  My son marveled over the design and how everything fits on the unit.  The kids vacuumed walls, blinds, drapes and sofas.  I got my money back alone from their cleaning frenzy.  My only regret is that I didn't have this sooner because my husband and son have allergies. I felt so badly seeing all of that debris in the wastebasket thinking how filthy those rugs were and how that filth might have affected their allergies even more. It is self-propelled and works very well on hardwood. Get the Pet Eraser!!

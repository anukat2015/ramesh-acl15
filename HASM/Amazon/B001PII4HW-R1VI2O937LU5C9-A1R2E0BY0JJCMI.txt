Title: The Little Sony That almost Could...
Content:
I have now owned this little traveler for a week and have seen its worth and its warts. First, and vital to me as a frequent flyer, I adore the size of the Vaio P series. It is so easily carried in a brief case - along with its small power brick. The weight is amazing - so light that it almost makes you wonder what's really in it! So in the travel department the Sony VGN-P530H is a hands down winner.
The screen resoultion is fantastic! I never use the zoom since I can easily read the fine resolution print. And in programs like Microsoft Word they all have their own zoom factors so it is not a problem to me. I do a lot of touch typing in the Word format and the keyboard works very well for me - but I do have small hands.
The battery life? Well there's the rub. The standard battery in normal usage last me an hour to an hour and a half. I have ordered the extended battery (and a case) from Sony Style.
The speed? True the loading is a bit long but once up and running I find the system, while not perky, at least adequate. A bit of tweaking with startup settings and it did improve. Also keeping the Vista sidebar to bare bones or none ar all helps.
Overall - I enjoy this little beauty and look forward to many airmiles with it.

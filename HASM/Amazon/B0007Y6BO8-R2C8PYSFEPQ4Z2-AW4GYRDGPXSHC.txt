Title: Best coffee flavor ever!
Content:
I first purchased the Melitta Brew Coffee Maker.  It was the worst coffee I had ever tasted.  All I ask for is a strong coffee flavor.  I sent this maker back and on the same day ordered the Krups coffee maker.  It is by far the best tasting coffee I have ever had.  The features are great and best of all the coffee tastes like coffee should.  If you are looking for a great coffee maker look for a Krups.  They are also moderately priced.

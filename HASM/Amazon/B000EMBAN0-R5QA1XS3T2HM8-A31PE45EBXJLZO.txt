Title: Can't handle pet hair
Content:
This vacuum has been a two year disappointment.  It has good suction, powerful motor, wide sweep, and good attachment performance - but it cannot handle pet hair.  Long before the dust chambers are full, and usually about 5 minutes into use, clumps of pet hair start forming around the dual chrome cones at the top of each cyclone chamber.  The hair then gets tangled around the cones, which then have to be removed in order to wrangle the hair free.  
Dust, dirt, and small debris empty easily, as advertised.  Just a bush of a button, and everything drops from the dust chamber into the trash.  If you have long-hair pets, however, I would avoid this vacuum altogether.  I called Dirt Devil customer service just to see if they had a different cone design that wouldn't clog after 5 minutes of use, but they could only refer me to a warranty service center.  Sadly, I think this design is flawed.

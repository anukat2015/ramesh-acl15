Title: Slick Travel Machine
Content:
I've owned a netbook since April '08 when I bought one of the first mass market Asus EeePC Surf models.  It was a useful travel tool, light, easy to store and secure, but it lacked two things.. screen size and an adult size keyboard.  The HP Mini 5101 covers both those issues and more.
I've had the 5101 for a week now, and been on my first trip with it.  No complaints.  Keyboard feels great, good key action.  Metal case (aluminum and magnesium) feels solid without being weighty.  The power brick is the same as the one my work laptop (also HP) uses, so I can even use that in a pinch when the 6 hrs of battery life runs out.  Wireless is great; I picked up wifi points my smaller netbook never saw at the same hotels and airports.
If you're looking for a solid work class netbook, I strongly recommend this one.

Title: Canon Rebel xt
Content:
The camera arrived in good shape. There was one problem, they asked for a signature to deliver.This is understandable, but with out prior notification and the fact that I work away from home I kept missing fedEx. I spent one night, after work tracking the package down in a town 20 minutes away. It would have been nice to talk to a real person on the Fedex end and to have had prior knowledge of a required signature so I could have made arrangements.

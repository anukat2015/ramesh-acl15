Title: Apple's small wonder
Content:
Most other reviews have touched on the major points of the iPod nano, so I just want to make a few observations:
-Yes, the iPod nano is almost disturbingly tiny, and you'll definitely want to get a case of some sort to keep it in lest you lose it or accidentally swallow it.
-Yes, the 4 GB version is probably a better buy if this is going to be your only MP3 player.   But if you have another, larger one the 2 GB will do just fine if you just use it for the gym, the bus ride home, etc.    
-The headphone jack on the nano is on the bottom, as opposed to the top- that doesn't make much sense to me, but you get used to it.  The "hold" switch is very tiny as well.
-The sound is great.
-I was surprised at how well photos turn up- the screen is about the same size as the screen on my digital camera, but photo resolution on the nano is *amazing.* Although, a zoom feature would have been nice.
-While the sticker for this iPod says $199, expect to pay *much* more for essential accessories.  My older 20 GB iPod came with an AC charger, but newer models don't- there's $30-40 right there.  And virtually all cases for this are outlandishly expensive- I paid $29 for a sport sleeve with an armband for gym use, and that was one of the cheaper ones.  And it's not just Apple gouging customers- most third party accessories are just as expensive.
I've complained a lot, but when all is said and done, the iPod nano is a really cool product.  (By the way, I'd recommend white over black, because as another reviewer said, white hides scratches and smudges better.)

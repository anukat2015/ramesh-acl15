Title: Saved me $1435
Content:
I've always liked a cup of cappuccino or a latte from Starbucks. Obviously nothing high-end, and one day I saw the ECMP160 at Target on sale for $49. I've always wanted my own machine and bought it on a whim. I was able to make some decent lattes and cappuccinos with it, at least as good as Starbucks, but that's not saying much. Over the next few months I developed a taste for espresso and just couldn't make it at home with the ECM160, which is steam driven. After doing a lot of research on [...] and [...], I had my sights set on a Bezzera BZ07 and a Vario Baratza grinder, which come to around $1500. I was surfing through youtube and saw someone making an espresso with the ECMP50 and it looked really good, so I bought it here on Amazon for $65. I've been buying my coffee from Terroir Coffee, already ground, and with this machine it makes a fantastic espresso, great crema, as good as any of the high end coffee shops I've tried. I am (temporarily) over my lust for a prosumer machine, but time will tell.

Title: zojiroshi coffee maker
Content:
The thing works very well.  Maybe a little pricey, 
Better establish a standard routine for the process, because it might be easy to damage the swing arm water feed if you get too ham handed.  Good fit and finish.We have no trouble using a standard #4 filter.  It sticks up a little, but the arm will go by easily.  Brew time is fine.
Clean up is easy.  There are 5 pieces to clean, but they all come to the sink.  One area on the maker needs wiped also.  Can't vouch for the vaunted brew temperature, because we aren't that fussy about our coffee.  I would think that the fineness of the grind is equally important - unless you are absolutely consistent, the temp may be moot.
The carafe is a good one. Pre-heating the thing extends the drinkable temperature.  For us the carafe goes a long way to mitigate the extra cost over your standard household coffee maker.  Carafe might dent easily.
So far, so good.    Rob

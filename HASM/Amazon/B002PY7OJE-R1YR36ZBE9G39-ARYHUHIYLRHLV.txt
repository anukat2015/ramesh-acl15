Title: Dell Inspiron 11.6 inch
Content:
I'm a 60 year old man with not great computer skills, but this was very easy to set up and it runs great and it is very fast.  The wifi makes it very convenient to do work outside of the office.  I'm not that good with my fingers so I still find it more convenient to use a traditional mouse and the keyboard is easy to use.

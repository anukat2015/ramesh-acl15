Title: A Fun Product to have around
Content:
The touch is a fun product to have. It is basically a mini computer you can carry around in your pocket. As long as you have a wifi connection available you can get to your e-mail, web sites, get RSS feeds, etc. The app store has lots of very useful tools and more are added every day. 
On the down side, having to pay $10 to get the latest upgrade was just stupid. I have been in IT since I was 20 years old and I have never-ever had to pay for an upgrade that was available before the product was purchased. No amount of discussion with Apple staff could persuade them otherwise. Apple wonders why they can't compete in the corporate space and its policies like this one that keep them out of that arena.

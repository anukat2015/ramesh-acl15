Title: Energy Hog
Content:
This unit keeps a full caraf and a half of water in its tank at all times. This tank has a heating element which keeps this water at 200 degrees at all times, 24-7, regardless if you want a cup of coffee or not. This tank isn't insulated. 
Honestly, why would any company build something like this? It may be fine for an office situation but a private home? Certainly not mine! It's packed up and going back!
I don't care what it looks like. It could be the nicest looking coffee pot in the world and it could last forever for all I care. The wasteful use of electricity kills the machine.

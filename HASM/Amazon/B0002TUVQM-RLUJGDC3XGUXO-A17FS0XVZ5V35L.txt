Title: Great until the paint comes loose
Content:
The Good: Worked well before paint on the inside turned loose.
Not so good: Very noisy, but I always turned it on and left the room.
    The bad: The black mixing paddle/blade is actually silver, once the paint turns loose.  :|
I let it heat up hot water and noticed that there were what appeared to be pepper flakes floating in the water.  It was from the mixing paddles.

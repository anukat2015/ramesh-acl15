Title: Overall, a good MP3 player
Content:
This is full-featured MP3 player that's a great value for the price.  The FM tuner is a great addition, although the reception isn't all that great.  It offers several play modes and equalizers for different types of music.  I'm amazed by the features they were able to load into this little gadget.  The voice recording capability sounded like a great feature, but I haven't found an occasion to have to use it.  I liked the fact that it operates on one AAA battery; however, I've found the battery life to be somewhat unpredictable.  Overall, a great product.

Title: simply too heavy and clumsy
Content:
It's a powerful machine, does a good job even after a year.  what i don't like is that the wand is heavier than the cannister, it doesn't swivel and has to be wrestled with.  This vacuum is very clumsy, a pain to use, and i leave it for my cleaning lady to use.  i choose one of two other vacuums in my house; i simply don't want to bother with this one.

Title: Very Bad Sign -- Dead on Arrival
Content:
I just received this player and I'm afraid to report that I can't even get it to take an initial charge. I've tried it on two computers and neither one recognizes it and the lights on the player don't light up. Am returning it immediately. Like a fool, I am also ordering another one in hopes that it's just bad luck. Sigh. All I want it to listen to books from NetLibrary. I have an iPod that I've had for two or three years and it still works great (a little buggy but I've learned how to reboot) but I want my books for free. 
I do hope that the next review I post will be about how great my replacement Zen Mosaic is.

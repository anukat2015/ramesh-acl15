Title: got it for $14.99 with free shipping from Amazon - very nice
Content:
It may seem like it does not put out a great deal
of heat because it moves a great deal of air. However
it is great for small rooms. Very nice design as well. 
I have noticed at the high setting the thermostat shut
off tends to kick in more than I like. At 750W it never 
shuts off the heater. I bought two. I will probably 
get two more in the future.

Title: Nice Product  and I like it
Content:
I like the product very much and recommend it as well.
Features/Cons: 
  High in performance,
  Slick design, light weight, 
  Nice quality of the product,
  Very good display, 
  Long battery life, 
  Quality of headphone and other stuff is excellent. 
  Controls are very good,
  Menu options and navigations is very good. 
  Audio Recording Quality is also sensitive and good.
Improvement needed:- 
  1) FM does not work outside the US - I assume it has not got a dual    frequency mode FM  - however, when you are out of country, least you like listening FM but more the stored songs and for this MP3 player quality is excellent.  
  2) Battery charging does not show the actual charged level. This causes me to check player's screen every time before removing, has it been charged? As it shows charged fully at the end only. 
  3) There is no facility to search a particular song. So, if you have around 900 songs loaded, to listen a particular song, you need to browse through a whole list! I am not sure if this feature is available in other brands. But it really helps in case a long list of songs and where browsing of songs in not that easy like in this set.
  4) Manual print quality is cheap, descriptions of the instructions is also not good.
Problem:
  1) Viewing a photo is slow, get very slow, even system gets hang, when you load a high resolution photos like of 7 mega pixels or higher or movie. This behaves similar even when you are browsing the photos-because it shows thumb nails of the loaded photo. 
Overall an excellent audio player but the video player is average.

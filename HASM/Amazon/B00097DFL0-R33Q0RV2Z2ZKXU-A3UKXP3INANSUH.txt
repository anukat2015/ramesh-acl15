Title: AVOID
Content:
I had ordered one of these units and went to pick it up directly from Sunpentown in nearby City of Industry, California where they are located.  While waiting for the air conditioner to be brought out I struck up a conversation with a gentlemen who had brought one in for repair.  He remarked that the first one he received was defective and that he had exchanged it for a replacement.  The replacement he was having repaired was getting fixed for the SECOND time.  At that point I was feeling uneasy about the unit I was about to bring home.  I asked an employee about how reliable the air conditioner was and he didn't seem to be very confident at all about the product.  I canceled my order.
A while back I had posted reviews of my experience but they appear to have been removed.  Although I didn't go through with the purchase of the air conditioner, I believe my interactions with the customer getting a unit repaired for a third breakdown and the lack of confidence on the part of an employee of the company could have value to someone considering a purchase (so Amazon, please do not remove!).

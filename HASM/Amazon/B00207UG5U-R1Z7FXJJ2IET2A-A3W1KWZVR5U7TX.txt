Title: Good Solid Computer
Content:
I've had this computer for about half a year and have had no problems with it. Its small enough to be taken with ease but also very fitting. full sized keyboard with a big screen. the only bad things about this computer i can think of are 1) short battery, its like 2 1/2 hours. 2) Vista Basic, we all no Vista isn't that good but i have Windows 7 so not a problem anymore 3) isn't great for Gaming. 2.16 Ghz with 2 GB RAM? not to powerful but will play older games. its a good Laptop for a great price

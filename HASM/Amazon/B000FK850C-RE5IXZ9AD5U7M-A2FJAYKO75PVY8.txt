Title: didn't meet our needs
Content:
We actually bought two of these heaters, one for each of my kids rooms. their rooms tend to be too warm in the summer and very chilly in the winter. I thought this would be perfect because it has a fan only function as well as the ceramic heater. unfortunately the force in which the fan blows is not enough to cool off a room. I don't know if i'll ever find something that meets both these hot/cold needs but i'm going to keep trying. in the meantime, if i only needed this to warm a room, it would definately be a keeper!! it warms up the room quickly, the oscillating blower is great, and i appreciate the safty features. while i would never leave a heater on in my kids rooms over night, it's a relief to know safety comes first with Sunpentown products.

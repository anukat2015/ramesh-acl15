Title: DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND TOSHIBA DOES NOT BACK UP THE PRODUCT
Content:
PROBLEM WITH THE INTERNET EXPLORER WHILE IN THE WEB THE IMAGES BLINK AND JUMP OUT OF CONTROL. TOSHIBA TECH PEOPLE BLAME THE SOFTWARE OF WINDOWS AND MICROSOFT BLAMES THE HARDWARE. AFTER 20 DAYS UNDER REPAIR NO BODY TAKES RESPONSABILITY, SO I SENT BACK TO AMAZOM AS TOSHIBA DOESN'T CARE. LOST $150.oo DUE SHIPPING CHARGES WHILE  I AM AWAY IN BUSINESS AND AMAZOM WON'T CREDIT THAT COST.

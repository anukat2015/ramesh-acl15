Title: Nikon D80 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body only)
Content:
I own the D70 and have enjoyed it tremendously. I do quite a bit of event work and picked up a D200 last year (owned by another photographer) and was convinced that it was too heavy to carry. Another friend owned a D80 and had nothing but good to say about it compared to his D70 so I decided to give it a try. The D80 seems to be the best option for those considering weight and contemplating an upgrade or first time investment in a digital SLR from Nikon. I love the larger lcd display and am getting used to the differences in the way the camera responds to light and records color, both are fine but different. Many new options -- some needed and some for the 1st time user who doesn't know how to work with photoshop. . . such as black and white, other color shifts, in camera cropping and exposure adjustments (I'll probably never use these features) Overall I give it 5 stars. I highly suggest you get a DVD on how to use the camera. . . even if you already know a lot. It is great to sit down and go through the features to familiarize yourself with the camera -- visually on DVD where you can stop and review with camera in hand rather than reading a manual that doesn't give you the same type of introduction. It takes a great deal of familiarity with the camera to be able to answer your questions using the manual. I personally like the Elite Video Series (Nikon D80 Made Easy).

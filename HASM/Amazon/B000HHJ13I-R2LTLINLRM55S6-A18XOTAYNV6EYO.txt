Title: Soleus - don't throw away your money
Content:
I paid $600 for Soleus PH4-12R portable a/c + heatpump. I was very happy for about three months, seemed to perform to specs. I even posted a very favorable review.But then it revealed it's true colors.
After about 3 months the blower developed a rubbing or bearing noise, transforming the unit  to near intolerable.
After 5 months the unit simply went dead, not even any lights on the controls. Yes, wall outlet has power.
Soleus warranty requires me to ship unit two directions to CA for warranty service. Troublke is, warranty does not cover shipping. After an estimate to pack for shipping = $50, and shipping the 100# unit two directions by UPS for $150 each, my "warranty" repair is $350. They have no service centers except their factory.
If I ship back, I will have invested $950 in this unit which has already proven it has no reliability. And there is no guarantee that they will not find some arcane reason to honor the warranty, despite my outlay for shipping.
The warranty is a complete ripoff since they use no standard national network - a key question when you think a large item has a good warranty. Ask to be sure before purchase.
STAY AWAY FROM SOLEUS!

Title: Coffeemaker
Content:
Makes a great cup of coffee. Easy to use. Only thing I miss on this model is the feature that lets you take a cup before it is finished brewing. Also, it is a little difficult to see the "On" light when it is lit. Otherwise, I am very pleased with this 5 cup coffeemaker.

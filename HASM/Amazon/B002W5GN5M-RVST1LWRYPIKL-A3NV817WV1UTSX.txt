Title: my 1st laptop
Content:
this laptop pretty awesome for what it has
the price was 429.99 + shippin + tax good price for an HP comp
even though a 250gb harddrive maybe to little for me
its find for users that want to surf the web and have a few music n movies files on it
the webcam is oh k what do you expect from a 1.3mega pixel webcam
you get a full keyboard which is nice :)a 6cell battery which sucks it last about 3 or less hours depeding
if you adjust the power settings i just use it straight with the plug i didn't put the battery on
win 7 home premium all ready install but i delete the OS and install win 7 ultimate 
weights about 6 pounds looks big when u close it but when its open its not that big its a perfect size

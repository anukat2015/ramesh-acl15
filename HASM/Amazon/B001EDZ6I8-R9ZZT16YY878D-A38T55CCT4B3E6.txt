Title: Ahhh!  My SoleAire came just in time for the arctic blast.
Content:
This is my favorite heater ever.  Using my iPhone noise level meter, it reads between 57-59 db when the unit is on. Hence, it is whisper quiet.  The bumps on the footrest actually make my feet feel good. The heater setting on High is toasty, while on Low is also adequate.  The fan-only mode would be great during summertime.  The smell that others reported is bearable and is slowly going away with each day of use.  The only negative is that one of the rubber feet came off.  This can be fixed easily with some adhesive.  Since I got it for 40% less than regular price, this makes it even greater.  Highly recommend it.

Title: Finally got my macbook
Content:
I had some issues when ordering my macbook.  I first pre-ordered it and was given a delivery date that was absurd.  I called amazon and they upgraded my shipping to one day shipping free of charge.  I would have to say that I was very pleased with Amazon's customer service.  I ran into another issue though.  My bank had already charged my bank account but Amazon said it did not clear.  After several phone calls with my bank and Amazon we finally were able to cancel the transaction.  I then placed my order again and was given a $30 credit to cover the one day shipping. I placed my order yesterday and I got my macbook pro today.  This is the second mac I have ever owned.  I had a mac desktop my freshman year of college and have been a pc user ever since. I have been waiting for the new macbooks to come out and once they did I made the change.  It was a hard decision since you can buy 2 pc's for the price of one macbook.  I am quite happy with my purchase.  The price seems justified just by the feel of this laptop.  It just feels like quality. I am no where near knowing what all this thing can do but just from the hour or so I have been on it, I couldn't be happier.

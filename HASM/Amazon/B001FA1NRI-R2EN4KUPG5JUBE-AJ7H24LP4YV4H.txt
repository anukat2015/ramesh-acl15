Title: a jogger's review :)
Content:
I already have an iPod classic that's large enough to fit my 10,000 song collection onto it. I purchased the new iPod shuffle because I got really tired of holding onto my chunky Classic when trying to go running, and the sleak clip-on design of the Shuffle was just what I needed. I have no complaints. I essentially use it to play a specific playlist that I've developed in iTunes so I don't need a screen to tell me what I'm listening to. And I don't need it to be able to hold 1000 songs since I only go through about 10-20 in one workout period.
The volume goes as high or as low as I need it. There is a toggle switch to turn the "shuffle songs" feature on or off which is nice so that I don't get tired songs being played in the same order over and over again. 
The overall usability is just as simple as I need it to be while I'm jogging. It's clipped onto my pants or my sleeve or my pocket and I can quickly press whatever button I need to take care of business without having to break my stride. And I've never had it come off which is what I was worried about the most. 
The only thing that didn't work for me was the earbuds. They tend to hurt my ears, and when running they work their way out of my ears completely. So I just invested in a pair of earbuds that wrap around my ears.
Some folks have issues with the fact that you can only charge it through a computer. This has not been a problem for me seeing as I update the playlist often and the shuffle recharges while I'm doing that. But the battery rarely runs down regardless.
I highly recommend this product if you're just looking for a simple, inexpensive MP3 player to have on your body without it getting in your way. It's worth every dime.

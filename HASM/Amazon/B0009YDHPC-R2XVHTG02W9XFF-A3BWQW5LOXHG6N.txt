Title: good coffee, bad espresso
Content:
After a year of using this we put it in the garage for the next yard sale.  I didn't have a problem with the coffee, but my husband thought the espresso part was terrible.  Here's our list of pros and cons:
Pros:
1.  smaller and shorter so it fit easily under cabinet - however - see cons for part two of this one
2.  simple and easy to use, very basic
3.  good, basic coffee
Cons:
1.  NO AUTO-OFF ON THE COFFEE MAKER.  This is a biggie if you leave it on at least 3 times a week like I did.
2.  Espresso was bad.  started tasting weak and being unpredictable in it's delivery after several months.  tried cleaning it but nothing worked.
3.  water door at back is large and you really have to pull this machine out from under the cabinet to fill it.  but the unit is really bulky to be pulling out every morning.  plus the little rubber feet on the bottom popped off instantaneously.
Hope this helps.  Not a terrible machine in my opinion, especially for the price.  You do get what you pay for.  But also not terrific.

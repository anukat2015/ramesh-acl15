Title: good suction but difficult to move around
Content:
Always had Hoover and needed a replacement for an older model cannister.  This looked great in the box.  But when I tried using it, found it very difficult to maneuver around.  The cannister does not roll over the cord.  So, if it gets stuck you have to literally pick it up.  Otherwise, great suction.  Would also have like to have all parts stored in the body, but the design did not allow it.

Title: Horrible, HP laptops overheat and last a year at the most, bad invesment.

ATTENTION:
HP laptops will give you nothing but problems in the end.  Do not purchase HP laptops, they are over priced and will be of no benefit to you in the end.  To those who enjoy spending thousands of dollars for a paper weight then go ahead.  Once the problems happens dont expect HP support to help you either,  I have read more compaints about HP support than I can count and I myself had the terrible experience of dealing with them.  In adidition if HP continues to treat its customers with this lack om empathy they won't even be around long enough to help you with your fualty computer your about to purchase.  Guys, honestly just don't do it.

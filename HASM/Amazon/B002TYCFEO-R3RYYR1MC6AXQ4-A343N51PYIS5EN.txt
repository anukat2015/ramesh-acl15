Title: Great Deal!
Content:
I got this laptop about 24hrs ago, and love it! It is great for the basic stuff like running word and internet. The price is what sold me on this laptop. Its screen is great and with the 3GB of ram it runs fast. I downsized processor from 1.8GHz to this 1.6GHz but I could not tell just by running it. Windows 7 has been fun to play with also! I really like the side by side open windows. Overall you can't get a better deal!

Title: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!!!!
Content:
Bought this, at Best Buy. Brought it home and 2 hrs. into it, the left click mouse stopped working. 30 miles back to the store,
(60 miles roundtrip) brought home another, same model. Next morning, began ALL OVER AGAIN, finally got everything entered, 3 hrs. on the phone with Norton, to transfer current account, tried to put in software, with the DVDCD drive, DIDN'T WORK! Back to the store, another 60 miles, roundtrip! The DVD/CD drive wasn't connected in the computer!  I should have known NOT to expect this to be good, as the laptop, same model, on display, in the store, WASN'T WORKING!  Got a TOSHIBA and am very happy with it! I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER HP PRODUCT AGAIN, AS LONG AS I LIVE. This was NOT my first product or PROBLEM, with HP computers!!!

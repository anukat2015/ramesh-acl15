Title: Love Love Love
Content:
I absolutely love my iPod! It took a few hours the first time I synced it...but if you charge it first and then sync it, it shouldn't take that long.  Now that I've already synced most of my music on to it, it only takes about 15 minutes each time I need to sync it again.  It's great. I don't have any problems!

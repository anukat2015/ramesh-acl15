Title: Sturdy little space heater
Content:
I work in a small office with the worst climate control; parts of the office will easily be freezing while others are incredibly hot. Unfortunately, I sit in an area that is always cold. I was looking for a compact, low-powered heater to help in my area and after much searching, I decided on this product.
At first I had reservations about the Vornado Soleaire because I didn't want a footrest...I wanted a heater, but since I wasn't able to find anything else that met my needs, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The Soleaire provides a nice, low-powered heat right underneath my desk that keeps me warm, without making other areas of the office uncomfortable. In fact, most people don't even know I have it on underneath my desk. 
It's relatively quiet and with all the hustle and bustle doing on the in the office you barely notice it (although it is noticeable when I'm the only one in the office, but I don't mind).
The biggest complaint I have is that the on/off switch and heat controls aren't as convenient as I'd like. It'd be great if you could turn it on/off easily with you foot instead of having to crawl under your desk to look. I've also noticed a few times that I've accidentally hit the heat switch with my foot and the air came out cold. 
Overall, I think this is a great product for anything needing temperature control over their personal space.

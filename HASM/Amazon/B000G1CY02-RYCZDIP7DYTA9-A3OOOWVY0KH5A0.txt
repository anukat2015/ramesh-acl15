Title: Very pleased with this heater
Content:
I love this heater.  It is perfect for a bedroom because it is very quiet.  Once I got the heat setting I liked, I just made a mark on the dial since there is no numbered thermostat.  My only complaint:  the price!  The day I saw this online it was selling for $59.99.  The next day when I placed my order, it was $99.99!  I see that it is back down to $59.99.  I was shocked.  Other than that, it is a great heater.

Title: Great value coffeemaker
Content:
We have had one of these coffee makers for several months.  It makes great coffee and is highly rated by Consumer Reports. The only disadvantages are that it is quite noisy while brewing and the window in the water tank is almost impossible to see through.  We have to measure the water in the carafe to fill the tank.  Coffee makers only seem to last a couple years these days, no matter what you pay for them, so why buy and expensive one when this one makes just as good coffee?

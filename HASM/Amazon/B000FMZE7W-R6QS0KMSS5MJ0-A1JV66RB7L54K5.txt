Title: Quality media player
Content:
After reading many reviews and doing ALOT of research I decided to take the plunge and get a zune. I can say that this is a high quality item...
I made the switch from a Philips GoGear 6GB mp3 player, and the difference between the two is astounding. 
Start up was VERY simple, and it's a plus that the Zune Marketplace is Vista compatible. Synching the device was even easier. Also, the music selection is impressive, considering that the marketplace is new. So...
Pros: 
-Ease of startup
-Huge music selection
-Arrived on time from Amazon
-Sound quality
-Looks great...
-Durable
-Pretty good battery life with wifi turned off
-User friendly menus
-Came with a protective pouch
-Firmware updates to improve quality are available
Cons:
-Album art tends to be pixelated at times
-Provided earbuds aren't the best of quality
-There currently aren't any music videos provided by the marketplace
Overall, 5 stars, because the pros definitely make up for the few cons. I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a new mp3 player.

Title: REVISED ....
Content:
After owning this Macbook Pro for over a half-year, I can say I'd never go back to PC. 
I DID get a faulty graphics card...the discrete-card setting results in system lock-ups routinely. Apple will repair, but I have to be without my machine for at least a week. As long as I run the integrated graphics, I have no problem.
And, aside from THAT...the machine is beautiful, OS X is almost perfect, and 8 GB of RAM allow multiple OS's running simultaneously (virtual) with no loss of performance. Anything is possible on this thing...
Suffice to say that my early love/hate relationship has gone to near pure love.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 
This is my first Mac after using Dell laptops since 2001. The learning curve was a little steep, but I am now comfortable with OS X. However, the machine itself is poorly made. I had one for a few weeks, and the Airport card stopped working, and the felt piece on the CD slot came loose and was hanging out. Went to the Genius, and he told me the machine would be 'DOA'ed, and I'd get a new one. Great...got a new one, and it has frozen up on me dozens of times. The first guy took me through a few system resets, but the problem resurfaced. Second Genius said to reformat and reinstall my OS. Did that, no help. Third guy says it's the keyboard/track pad, and I will have to now be without my computer for several days. NOT acceptable as I use this for work.
Bottom line, it's a pretty machine, and would be great if it worked as advertised. It does NOT just work, however :(
If you count on your machine being available every day for work or other productivity, stay away from a MAC. If it breaks, you're without it for DAYS!. I remember when the DELL technician came to my office and replaced the motherboard in my computer right on my desk!.
MACs will never surpass PC's because they are too much flash and not enough dependability.

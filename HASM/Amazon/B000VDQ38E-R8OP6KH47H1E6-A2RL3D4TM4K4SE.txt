Title: disappointed, to say the least
Content:
I generally like to review a product after a few months of use. By then, you aren't biased by the 'new toy glow'.
So, after 6 months of use, I can honestly say there is not one thing I love about this vacuum cleaner. 
We have 2 dogs - a Golden Retriever and a Great Pyrenees. After researching several vacuums marketed to pet owners, we agreed this one seemed to be the best reviewed and the price seemed reasonable.
Within a few weeks of daily vacuuming, we noticed that where the pet hair winds around the roller (we actually had to use scissors to cut it loose), the hair had actually burned 'tracks' into it.
It is awkward to manuever. It doesn't fit along the edges of the kitchen floor that run under the cabinets.
The suction is great...if you don't mind picking things up and 'feeding' them to the vacuum cleaner. 
The hose is stiff and heavy, making stairs even less delightful to vacuum.
The brush 'stalls' when pulling the vacuum back toward you unless it's on the highest plush setting (we have berber). The result is that wonderful burning rubber smell that remains long after you unplug the thing.
Perhaps people with short haired dogs will have better luck, but if you have long haired breeds, steer clear of this one....and let me know if you find something good!  ;)

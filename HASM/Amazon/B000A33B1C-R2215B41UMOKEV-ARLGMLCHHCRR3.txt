Title: Major Service Problem
Content:
I have been very pleased with this unit for quite some time. So, you might say, then what's the complaint? Well, I am amazed now to find that if something goes wrong, you're out of luck. There is no service center available, nor will the company send parts to the customer for in-home repair - which, in this case, would be very easy. Following is the direct quoted info that I have received from De'Longhi Customer Service: "Dear Valued Customer, Unfortunately the model TRD0715T is not a serviceable product. We do not offer service on this model. We regret to inform you that we will not be able to assist you with your inquiry." They will not send the needed part to me even though they have it. So, this renders an excellent product useless if something goes wrong. So, beware!! It's a crap shoot! If anyone knows where I could obtain parts for this unit independent of the company, please let me know. Thanks!

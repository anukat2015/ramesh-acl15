Title: I love this little heater
Content:
A fine little quartz heater, the top element heats first and when running it on HI it consumes only 800 watts, about half of most quartz heaters. Very light in weight, silent, it warms you quickly and does a great job! Far better than the little $20 reflector unit made by the same company (the heater that looks like a little fan), I got both and THIS is the one to buy!!

Title: Unreal!
Content:
I don't write many reviews, and I know this is model isn't being manufactured anymore, but if you're thinking of buying one second hand or something, don't hesitate. It's the best mp3 player I've ever had. I've dropped it about a hundred times (no exaggeration) and it still works perfectly. For this reason alone, I implore you -GET ONE!
Other than that, it's simply great. Stores about 1100 / 1200 songs depending on bit rate etc... doesn't nearly fit all of my music... but certainly does the job. Have never experienced any problems with software jams and I'm using Windows XP. Seamless integration. Perfect. This one is actually worth the retail price. Probably more.
Have a good one!

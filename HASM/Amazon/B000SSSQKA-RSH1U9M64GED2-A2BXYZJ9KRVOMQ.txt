Title: Poor performance
Content:
Looks nice, lightweight, easy to maneuver. Design of brush head is odd. There is an auxiliary square vent that provides most of the suction at the bottom of the floor head, thus diluting suction power from the main opening into the wand. My unit's roller did not turn so I sent it back for a refund.

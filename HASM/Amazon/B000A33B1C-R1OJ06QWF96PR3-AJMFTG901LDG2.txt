Title: Amazon sent me a damaged or possible used heater
Content:
When I saw the box, I immediately noticed it was previously opened and re-taped.  (Minus two stars since it was a returned item).   As I pulled the heater out of the box, it had very visible dents in the side fins.  (Minus another two stars)  I'll update this comment with a link to show the damage.   The only positive experience is that the heater works fine.  I'm debating if I should return this item or not.  It is a hassle for me to return the item.   I'll contact Amazon customer service and ask them todo an even exchange for a new one.    I've been having bad luck with Amazon when it comes to non-electronic items.

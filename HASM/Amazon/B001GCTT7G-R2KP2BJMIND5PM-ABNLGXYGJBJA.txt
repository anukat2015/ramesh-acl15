Title: Little Mac- (pc to mac- like going from a cd player to an ipod)
Content:
There are so many reviews on this already.  There isn't too much to add.  
So here were my big concerns and conlcusions after one month of ownership.
Is it hard to switch to a Mac-
     very very easy.  I used firefox on a PC, now I use firefox on a Mac.  With all the cool gestures its even better than firefox on a PC.
 Mac version of MS office is better and easier than MS Office for Windows, which is weird considering MS should really make its own OS version better, but I guess it has more to work with on a Mac.
Picasa- now available for Mac.
utorrent- now available for mac.
Glossy screen- I hate glossy screens, but the mac 13.3 glossy screen is fine.  Never once had any glare ever. On a comprable pc glossy screen, glare was so bad I returned it.  So the screen is actually one of the best I have ever used, even compared to my samsung 24 inch desktop monitor.
mini displayport- get an HDMI connector from monoprice. That way you can have video out to your HDTV for hulu and such.  But does not carry audio- so you have to also have a audio cable of some kind out to your speakers or tv or such.
I guess thats it.  Otherwise, what can I say.  After 3 failed windows laptops, from hard drive crash, driver issues, overheating, cracked monitor hinge etc,  I finally got a mac.  The funny thing is when I use a pc now,  I realize that a loading time of 5 or six seconds to start a program just doesn't happen on macs.  Its like going from a cd player to an ipod.

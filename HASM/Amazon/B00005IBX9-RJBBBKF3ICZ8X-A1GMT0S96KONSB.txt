Title: Warm Coffee
Content:
I have been using this coffee maker for 3 weeks now, it makes a good cup of coffee , but it only makes warm coffee ! The ads for this coffee maker say that it makes piping hot coffee. The adjustable heating plate and the 1-4 cup setting do not make any difference in coffee temp.
 I think these settings are just a marketing gimick!
 If you want hot coffee , try a different coffee maker.

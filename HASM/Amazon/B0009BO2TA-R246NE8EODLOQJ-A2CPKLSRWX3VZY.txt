Title: Worse vacuum I ever owned
Content:
In three words - cheap, cheap cheap. We've had this vacuum for a year and and it is now more or less useless. On it's best day, clean bag and all, the suction is poor. When the bag gets slightly full it is nonexistant. If I could rate this with zero stars I would.

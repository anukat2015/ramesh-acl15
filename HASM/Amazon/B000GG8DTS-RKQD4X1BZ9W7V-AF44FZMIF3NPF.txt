Title: Great little spot heater
Content:
I love this little heater.  I bought one of these last year to use at my desk. My home office doesn't get adequate heat and stays in the 64 to 67 degree range. I wanted something inexpensive to run that would warm the area around my desk. This little heater does that perfectly while consuming only 300 watts. 
It is definitely not powerful enough to heat a whole room, but if you are stationed mainly in one area of the room, like at a desk, and want some spot heating, it fits the bill. I can also set it back four or five feet and it will "beam" some gentle heat up under my desk to keep it from being so chilly at floor level.
No fan, so it's absolutely quiet. No thermostat, so you do have to switch it off and on manually, which I don't mind.
(Note: product image was missing when I wrote this review. It looks similar to the 14 inch model, just a little smaller.)

Title: Can't Buy Refills for Flavia Fusion
Content:
Machine is really great but the packets aren't sold anywhere except online - better off going with one that has their individual coffee and tea readily available in grocery stores and specialty stores instead of trying to find a distributor - it's not easy and is sure ain't fun!

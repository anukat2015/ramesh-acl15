Title: Bad smell.
Content:
This machine cleans well and is light-weight but my problem has been that it emits a very bad smell.  I have meticulously cleaned the filter, hose, and inside surfaces to no avail. It continues to smell, even with new filters.  I thought it was due to living in Hawaii, but my daughter in Southern California has the same problem.  Another annoying thing is that the power units comes off the wand when vacuuming on carpeted stairs.  Sorry I can't recommend this machine.  Now I'm looking for another vacuum to replace it.

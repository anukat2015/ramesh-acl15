Title: Needs new carafe design
Content:
I had the old Mr. Coffee coffeemaker for 10 years and loved it, but it died last year, so I bought this new model as a replacement.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the carafe spills consistently when you are pouring coffee in your cup.  It is not a big deal - just annoying because you will always have to wipe your counter after pouring your coffee.  This is a case where Mr. Coffee should have left the original design in place, but I suppose this new model is cheaper for them to manufacture.  I have noticed that the coffee filter occasionally folds over at the edge, causing the grounds to get in with your cofee, but this is not very common.  If you make sure your filter is pushed out around the edges, it will decrease the chances of that issue.  Overall, I am not impressed with this coffeemaker, but it gets the job done.

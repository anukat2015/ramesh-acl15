Title: Excellent for pet hair & dirt on CARPET
Content:
I rarely write reviews, but ALWAYS read them, felt it was my duty to help others out.
OVERALL: Giving it four stars as a great CARPET/UPHOLSTERY vacuum.
I have had this vacuum for nearly two years and it is WONDERFUL for all types of carpet. It has as much suction as it did the day I bought it.  I have FOUR dogs ... it is amazing for pet hair and dirt on carpet. I use the pet hair mode with the lifter and it picks up dirt and hair like crazy. It is also excellent on throw carpets. The ones by the doorways doing their job, are filled with fine dirt .. it gets it all!
Oh yes, the accessory tools are very good too and work well on upholstery. Only issue is the short length hose.
I'm NOT thrilled with it for tile floors because it blows the hair and dirt around quite a bit and doesn't make a good seal with the tile. 
 
It IS VERY VERY LOUD .. my dogs are hide when it comes out.

Title: Stunning Camera System
Content:
I bought this from Adorama after 1 full year of review reading.  Was a tough decision to spend this kind of money... but several weeks later I'm am blown away by the construction, the features and the picture quality.  The colors are stunning, life-like and can be tailored to fit your needs.  It doesn't matter what you're shooting - this camera handles anything I throw at it.  I bought it with the 18-200mm Nikkor VR lense, and then added the Tokina 12-24mm.  Two pieces of glass that completely complement this camera.  No regrets, and plenty of learning and growing to do.  Highly recommended.

Title: Works Great
Content:
After two weeks' use, I am very pleased with this machine. I didn't really need a programable feature or the charcoal filter, but it's easy enough to just leave the filter out and turn it on manually. I have always used the cone type filters as I thought they would make better coffee, but I find the basket filters are just as good or better. This machine makes great coffee, is easy to load, easy to clean, and matches my other stainless and black kitchen appliances perfectly.

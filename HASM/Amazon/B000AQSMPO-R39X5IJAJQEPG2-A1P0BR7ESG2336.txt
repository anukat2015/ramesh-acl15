Content:
We loved the unit up until recently.  Just in the last month or so (after owning it for one year) the coffee has been extremely weak, almost to the point of not bothering to use the unit.  We've called Keurig and they told us to clean it.  We did, but still weak coffee.  They've yet to get back to us.  We loved it up until recently, but are about to switch to something else.  When the unit worked well, the coffee was a bit on the weak side, but good.  Lately, however, it's been way too weak for us.

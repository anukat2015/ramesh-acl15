Title: Please disregard the whiners. This is a great coffe maker.
Content:
I am 65 year old and live in Louisiana. In case you don't know really good coffee
is almost a religion down here.Have been using automatic coffee makers for at least 30 years. The list includes Norelco, Bosh, Braun, Rowenta, Mr. Coffee and
Presto.All of them and I mean all of them had some quirk or feature I wasn't thrilled with.Presto was the most recent. It made really smelly coffee. Fixed that by steeping the strongest coffee I ever made in the tower for 4 days. After that the coffee was finet till the extremely thin glass of the carafe broke and that was the end of Mr. Presto. Bought the Michael Graves shortly after that and have been using it for several years now. The point of all the forgoing is that
all of the coffee makers I have had had something to nit pick about.If you are really serious about good coffee and like the design of the machine, you may have to go through several returns to the store till you get one that works as it should. Lets remember folks these things are all made in the thousands in China as cheaply as possible.RE: Michael Graves. The blue light doesn't bother me. Where else can you find a coffee machine that look lie it came form the ward room of the Star Ship Enterprise? Have no trouble with pouring or brewing strong or weak coffee. All and I mean all of the above makers dripped at one time or other. It goes with the territory people. Only the Bosh made really outstanding coffee and that was years ago. Great coffee is back if you are willing to work with it. Buy the machine and try it. I really like mine. Even better than the Bosh 20 years ago. Hope this helps.Good luck.

Title: Cozy feet gives me cold shoulder
Content:
When I first plugged in my Cozy Feet I thought it was broken.  There was simply no detectable warming.  I bought another one hoping it was just a lemon.  But the second one was the same way.  After trying it several times I finally detected a faint, and I do mean faint, warming of the pad. I had to hold it in my hand as I plugged it in.  Only then could I detect a change in temperature.  I kept one and returned one.  I've installed them in my ski boots.  I have very low expectations when I finally hit the slopes.

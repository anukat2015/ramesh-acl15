Title: Works for me
Content:
after the disaster of using a Krups  machine, we tried this one from Cuisinart. What a nice switch. It brews a strong cup of coffe so be prepared to adjust your portions, but we have had very few problems. The grinder is not as loud as some others we've heard, and the clean up, while time consuming ( there are a number of pieces that need cleaning and you need to go inside the grinder area with a paper towel to get everything out) is the price paid for having the convenience of this one step process. I like fresh ground coffee and this one works for me.(Until they invent the self-cleaning one.)

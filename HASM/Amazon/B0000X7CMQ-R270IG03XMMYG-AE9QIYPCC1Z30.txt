Title: An excellent product!
Content:
We're very pleased with our new coffee maker.  The machine is very easy to fill with water and coffee, and it makes delicious coffee. The insulated carafe keeps the coffee warm for hours without "cooking" it, so the coffee still tastes fresh after an hour or more.  I am especially happy with how easy it is to clean the machine.  There's an inner plastic cone that holds the #4 paper filter; it pops right out to dump the grounds and rinses clean.  Then the basket that holds the plastic cone slides off easily too, and the mouth of the stainless steel carafe is wide enough to clean with a standard dish washing brush - it rinses clean too.  An excellent product!

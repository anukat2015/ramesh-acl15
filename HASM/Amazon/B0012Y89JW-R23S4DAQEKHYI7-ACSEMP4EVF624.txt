Title: Canon EOS 450D Camera
Content:
The camera is evolutionary on the Canon EOS 40D model with greater megapixels, in a compact package. It handles easily, and does not increase the burden on the user because of excess weight. The image stabilization feauture on the 18-55MM lense is a pleasant addition to the kit lense, and gives a  greater level of control over pictures. I am forced to seek out image stabilization lenses because the excess weight causes my hands to shake. I look forward to using the Camera in Florence and Venice this Fall.

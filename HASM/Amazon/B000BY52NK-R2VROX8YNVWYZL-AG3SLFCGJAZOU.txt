Title: It doen't get any better than this.
Content:
Moving up in the digital camera world and read many reviews on many digital cameras.  This D200 is closer to a professional digital camera than I initially thought I needed but I do not regret it one bit.  This is a superb piece of equipment, sturderly built with features equivalent to cameras at twice its price. Simply holding it gives you the sense that this camera is well made. It is heavier that the typical "plastic" digital cameras and ergonomically fits into your hand.  The 10.2MP is more than is needed for typical postcard size or even 10 x8 photographs but gives you the option to downsize and select the size and quality of the images that you desire. However once you see the picture quality you will be wanting to blow up your shots to wall size. It is certainly not for the casual photographer who pulls the camera out at parties and family gatherings - for that my daughter's Canon SD800 is a superb choice.  But if you are a serious amature photographer who wants to "play with the big boys" this is the camera for you. Features such as the 5 frames per second, the weather sealed body and aluminum frame, instant response (I no longer need to snap the camera  1 or 2 seconds before my daughter emerges from below the water in her breast stroke and hope that I got her at the top of the stroke), and many more great options make this a camera that I can not put down.  Buy this with the 18 - 200mm Nikon zoom lens (and at least a 2GB storage card)and you will never buy another camera - well that's what I told my wife, but I actually believe it.

Title: Good out of doors, poor using a flash
Content:
I've been a life-long Nikon user going back to the Nikormat. I upgraded to the D70 since I have a number of Nikon lenses, I thought it logical to purchase the D70. While the pictures taken out-of-doors are very good to excellent, using the internal flash indoors is very disappointing. When I need flash pictures I use the Canon G2 which produces excellent results, while the D70 is consistently under-exposed. I sent the camera back to Nikon for analysis. They found nothing wrong, stating I needed to by the external SB-600 flash. I fail to understand why virtually all other digital cameras come with a proper internal flash. (Has anyone else had this issue?)

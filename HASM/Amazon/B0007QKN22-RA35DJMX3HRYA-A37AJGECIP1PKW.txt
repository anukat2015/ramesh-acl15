Title: Great SLR for the masses
Content:
I have 3 other Canon Digital cameras and wanted to try slr to see if it was a good step. I have to study and practice, but the low light pictures of childern and grandchildren with no flash and nice color and tones is worth it.I still use the smaller cameras for ease of carrying and use, but this really gives versitility I cant get from the lower end Canon Cameras. The Rebel XT is in a great price range now that the XTi is out, but if you don't need the latest and greatest in an SLR, the you can't go wrong with this one.

Title: Best buy, with small enhancements ($19.95 at Fred Meyer)
Content:
Buy this one at Fred Meyer. It's $19.95, plus $9.95 for a Mr. Coffee gold filter basket.
Best buy. If you want better, spend $100 and quit griping. Only enhancement would be a baffle to prevent overflow of water-soaked grounds from basket when making 12 cups.
Repeat: quit griping when you buy an inexpensive item.

Title: Perfect for my task-at-hand
Content:
I already own a 40 gig Creative Nomad Jukebox (the original Jukebox, which came with a 6 gig drive, but was quite hackable).That player is perfect for listening when I'm relatively stationary -- in the car, on a plane -- but isn't so good for grabbing and walking around with.  I've been considering a flash memory-based player for a while for those situations, but they're TOO limited in capacity and/or price.  I also considered just getting a new large-capacity MP3 player, like a Zen, but didn't want to spend that much money and lose the advantages of the Jukebox (yes, they exist).Enter the perfect compromise -- the Muvo2 4GB.  Tiny, good battery life, reasonable price.  Not as much capacity as my Jukebox, but plenty of space for a day's worth of music (and then some).  The fast USB2.0 interface makes changing the content a snap (I have all 2000+ CDs I own encoded on a media server at home).Battery life is MUCH better than the Jukebox on a single charge, but the Jukebox takes AA batteries making it very easy to find replacements on long trips.  I find the controls perfectly intuitive, although I was helped by having a very well-structured system for folders and filenames on my media server -- one that meshes very well with the Muvo.When in the car or on the road, my Jukebox contains most of my CDs, and uses standard easy-to-find batteries if I can't conveniently charge the player.  When tooling around town for the day, the Muvo contains enough music to keep me entertained while not weighing me down.  So each player has its niche role in my life, and each does the job well.

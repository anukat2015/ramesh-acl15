Title: This is not a great news !
Content:
Apple Air has great look and nice functionality, but the price is too high. And the mobility or much-advertised size and weight are not big news either. Because Acer Aspire One (A110L Intel Atom N270) is even lighter in weight as it weighs actually less than 0.9 kg! Apple Air weighs 1.36 kg! Much more important, Acer Aspire One cost only about 350 dollars. With what you pay for Apple Air, you can buy 4 Acer Aspire One ! And it has 80 GB in harddisk, XP, and Wlan. Now it is a big hot item in Scandinavia. While in the US, people are paying 4 times to buy this thing? And call it a great invention? Go figure!

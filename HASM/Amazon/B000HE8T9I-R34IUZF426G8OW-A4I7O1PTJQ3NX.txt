Title: It's just not a great vac.,,especially since it cost $200
Content:
I've had the Infinity Upright Vac for about a year now. Here's what I have found:
1. It handles like a nightmare. It's cumbersome and doesn't roll or turn all that well. It's actually difficult to push around. 
2. The belt is constantly slipping off or breaking. Every week I'm back on the ground trying to fix the belt so I can vacuum, and it's been this way from the beginning. 
3. It's a pain to clean. You have to take it all apart and clean each part individually...and it says you should do it each time you vacuum. Then, you have to lay it all out to dry for at least 24 hours before you can snap it back together. 
4. For hard floors: the lowest setting scratched my floors up, and the next to lowest setting didn't pick up any dirt. 
5. It's heavy and large. Don't even try lugging it up and down stairs, and if you want this vacuum, make sure you have a big closet to keep it in.
I really kind of hate this vacuum, but I just haven't felt like dishing out MORE money to replace it. However, I'm about to go ahead and get it over with. If I have to keep vacuuming with this sucker I'll go insane. There are only so many belts I can change.

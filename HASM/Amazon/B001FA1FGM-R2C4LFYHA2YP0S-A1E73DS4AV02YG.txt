Title: BOTH worked fine....for a short while!!!
Content:
I purchased this heater at Home depot in November or December of '08. It worked wonderfully by gradually warming my large master bedroom with huge drafty windows to a level of toasty comfort. It was great as an alternative to turning up my thermostat & warming the entire home when I remain in one room 85% of my time home. Then it simply stopped working after a couple months!!! I assumed I had gotten a faulty unit and returned it. Home Depot allowed me to exchange it for another. That one worked fine for the remaining couple months of the season then I put it away in my bedroom closet in spring. Winter '09 season rolled around and when I plugged in the unit it did absolutely nothing. It clicked a couple times and began to warm but after about 30 minutes it stopped working. I searched it for reset buttons and found reset instructions that said unplug for 30 minutes the try agin. I did better than that. I unplugged it for 3 more months & used a good old fashioned and reliable, albeit less safe and less eco or energy friendly coil heater. I recently had out of town houseguests and went to use the heater again in the guest bedroom & I got pissed when it still didn't power up. After reading about others with the same problem, I now realize this heater was a piece of crap. I wish I had replaced it with a different brand or model when I had to replace the first one. This was not a cheap heater so I hope Sunbeam will honor a warranty and replace the product.

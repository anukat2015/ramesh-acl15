Title: My Refurbished Cusinart Cutey Gets a Workout EVERYDAY!
Content:
My friend GAVE me her refurbished REPLACEMENT Brew Central when it arrived. She was annoyed the "immediate cup of coffee" feature on the original broke and sent it back for replacement. She was disillusioned that the replacement was not NEW but REFURBISHED and went on to buy a new Krups Coffeemaker. I offered to take the "used" coffeemaker off her hands. 
So for less than $10 (a breakfast I treated at IHOP), I've had it for over TWO years and counting... I make at least 2 pots of coffee or tea each day and I'm very pleased. I no longer had to buy a new coffeemaker every year as in the past. I've gone through Mr. Coffees, Brauns, Black & Deckers etc. The 12 cup carafe is sturdy with excellent no spill pouring lip, the metal coffee basket saves on filters, the sleek black matte style fits well in my kitchen, waking up to a timed fresh pot of coffee  is wonderful, as is getting an "immediate cup" before the entire pot is done AND it makes a good pot of coffee.
I haven't had any problems with this refurbished cutey; it gets a workout EVERYDAY! As the economy tanked, we began turning our Brew Central into "Starbuckery". We use our own flavorings, spices and whipped cream to make coffee beverage treats to enjoy at home. Now if it could also quickly bake cookies and play cool music we'd be set. Trust me I'm working on it. 
It's tall, the water tank is in the the right quadrant and I'm short so I have to stretch to pour in the water. My sink has a water filter so the Brew Center water filter is not a selling point for me.

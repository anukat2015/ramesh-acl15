Title: Fire and Shock Hazard
Content:
The unit that I got had a hernia.  A red heater wire was sticking out of its gut.  The wire was pinched between the side cover and the radiator fin.  Luckily, the wire insulation did not break, otherwise the unit would have gone up in smoke.  Surgery was successfully performed and the wayward wire was tucked back inside.  The unit gets 1 star because of the possible fire and shock danger of the pinched wire.  Note that the heater has been coated with an anti-rust chemical that gives off a nausiating smell until it burns off.

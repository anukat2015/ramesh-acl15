Title: Not as good as I hoped
Content:
I was excited about purchasing this coffee maker but I agree with some of the other reviewers. The bubbles on the left inaccurately tell how much water is in the base. Now the off/on button is stuck and it doesn't turn on! That's a real bummer when you're ready for your coffee.

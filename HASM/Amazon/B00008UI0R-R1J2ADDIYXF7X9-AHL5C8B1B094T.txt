Title: Already broken after 7 months of use
Content:
I was very impressed with the suction when I first bought this vacuum 7 months ago. Except for the fact that I had to continuously empty the dirt compartment, it seemed to pick up everything, especially my dogs hair. Recently I was vacuuming and I noticed the dirt was spitting out from the bottom instead of being sucked in. My husband took it apart and cleaned out the hose that was clogged. After that it worked for a few minutes, then it wouldn't switch to carpet mode anymore. We had to drive a half hour to the nearest Hoover repair shop since it was still under warranty. They said the motor in the nozzle had burnt out and it would cost $88 to fix it. When I called Hoover to complain that this should not happen to a brand new vacuum that I didn't have any prior problems with. They said they were very sorry, but there was nothing they could do about it.(or would do!) I am so steamed I refuse to pay to get it fixed when it will probably happen again. My mother also bought this vacuum around the same time and hers is always shutting down from being overheated. I would never buy a Hoover again.

Title: Sour Coffee
Content:
I don't know what the deal is with this coffee maker, but I can't seem to get a good cup of coffee out of it. It comes out sour! No matter how much I clean it. I've tried it with numerous brands of coffee... That and you have to be on a perfectly level surface to get 2 even cups out of it. Otherwise one cup will overflow and the other will only be half full. Not that impressed.

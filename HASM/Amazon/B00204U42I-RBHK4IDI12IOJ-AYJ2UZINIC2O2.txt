Title: Looks new.
Content:
This is a base model Dell Studio 1737. This appeares to be a refurbished downgrade. The keyboard feels as though it has had some use....a little quirky....the "e" needs extra pressure to register....the keys are very noisy and give the sense of being a used item. The graphics card, an intel 4 series is just adequate.       The studio original box with the original disks is present, a nice touch. The quirkiness continues; this is a Vista32; the included disk is a Vista64. The bluetooth is either disconnected or not present. I like the looks of this computer. I don't like the quirky, noisy, heavy touch keyboard. Oh yeah, the screen looks good,too, with enough brightness for me!       My only real disappointment is the keyboard; otherwise, I would recommend this. Don

Title: Excellent Ultra Portable
Content:
I deliberately waited until after Windows 7 came out before ordering this ultra portable.  I was looking for something as light as a netbook but with a usable display that I could use when traveling.  At 11.6 inches, this was as small as my eyes could handle.  So far I am very happy with it.  Windows 7 with Aero runs just fine.  With the dual core processor, it seems faster than my older desktop with a faster single core processor and XP.  The screen is very bright and sharp.  On the downside, the display is glossy and takes some positioning to get the best contrast, and don't have bright light behind you.  The full size keyboard took me some time to get used to.  I didn't have a issue with placement of some of the special keys as every laptop seems to have some keys in different places.  Battery life is well in excess of 4 hours which is the limit I have run the batteries to before recharging.  The battery meter still showed well over an hour at that point.

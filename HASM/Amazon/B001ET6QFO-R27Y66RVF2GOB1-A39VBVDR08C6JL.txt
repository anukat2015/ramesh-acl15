Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens
I purchased this product as a replacement/addition for/to my 2005 Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT, which I was using in dusty and wet environments.  The body is partially weather and dust sealed, which is useful in the above conditions.  It is an improvement in ease of use, and ergonomics.  The price point is higher, but the body definitely has less of a plastic like feel.  Live view is useful for framing photos, and the additional high speed burst mode avails itself for action shots at 6fps. 
The included Digital Photo Professional (Version 3.5)is useful for raw file manipulation.  One downside is the requirement for a large and fast compact flash card (can be pricey), if one is to take advantage of jpeg and raw images concomitantly with little compression.
This camera is nice if one requires better results at ISOs 1,600 and 3,200.  "Cnet reviews" concurs stating this is because the higher resolution delivers extra sharpness without showing significantly more noise.

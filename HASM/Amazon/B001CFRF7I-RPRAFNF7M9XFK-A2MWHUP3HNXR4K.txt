Title: Heats well, but turns off at slighest bump
Content:
I bought this to replace the one in my golf cart. It does heat quite well without roasting you, but it's constantly turning off at the slightest bump. I know this is a safety feature, but i was told it would work fine in my cart. I'll keep this one in the garage for emergencies.

Title: Very useful heater that packs a punch.
Content:
Got this heater this year and really love it. It does a really great job of keeping me warm while working in my garage. I love the fact that it takes two 1 lb. throwaway cylinders. The two tanks actually last a lot longer than I had anticipated. One of the best things about it is the fact that it can be moved anywhere I am working. Often times, those heaters on propane bottles are hard to position to adequately feel the heat. But with the big buddy, I can position up high, down low...you name it. Great heater.

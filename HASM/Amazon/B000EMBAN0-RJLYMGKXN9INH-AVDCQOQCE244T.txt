Title: If you like dirt...
Content:
I purchased this vac about a year ago after owning a typical upright with a bag.  At first, I thought it was great! It was powerful and I loved the small spinning brush attachment for doing stairs & furniture.  Then it came time to empty it.  I'm not sure what the problem was with the good ol' bag vacs, when it was full you put the bag in the garbage and replaced it. It took about 2 seconds and you didn't have to see OR touch the dirt.  Well those days are gone, apparently it's better to SEE the dirt.  Touch the dirt.  Put your arms in the chamber up to your elbows so you can pull out the stuck dirt.  How is this better?  Then you have to rinse off the filter which requires touching & seeing more dirt.  When it gets full or something gets stuck, it loses suction, just like the bag vacs did.  I know this isn't a Dyson, but if it's full, it's full.  Which is going to inhibit the vacs ability to suck in more right?  I don't get the cyclonic thing either.  The things spin around and guess what happens to hair, string, etc.? It gets wrapped around those spinning things and you have to go in there & pull it off. Only a genius could have thought of this, surely.  Anyway, if you want to be truly united with all the gross stuff you suck off your floor...this bagless, cyclonic technology is for you!

Title: Best little vacuum!
Content:
I love this vacuum. I have hardwood and Berber carpet in my home and it is a very small home. This vacuum is so compact but has a lot of power and makes sweeping very easy with little effort. It doesn't have attachments but I use a shop vac for any of that. Five starts without a doubt!

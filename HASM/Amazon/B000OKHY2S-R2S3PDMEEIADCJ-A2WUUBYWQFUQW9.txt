Title: Takes off the edge in Seattle
Content:
It is like having a constant cool breeze. I would recommend this for areas that are on the fringe of needing A/C but you could get away with not having one. This thing will take the edge off on a hot day. And it has great features like "swing" which moves the fan 60 degrees back and forth, left to right, to cover a larger area of the room. I like just directing it all to me when I am working by the computer though. It is portable so you can move it into the bedroom at night.
I'm pretty darn happy with this thing. Uses much less energy than an A/C.
Updated: This unit didn't really hold up in the long run for me. Broke and stopped cooling as well as when I first got it. Was hard to keep clean as well.

Title: Highs too High!
Content:
I was hesistant about this product, for good reason. I was replacing my 5.5g ipod that was stolen... turns out that nothing apple cranks out would compare.
The sound quality on this IS IN FACT worse. I thought the audiophiles reviewing the sound quality online were just being picky, but the sound really hurts my ears because of the intense treble and the mids that are missing.
The symbols sound so fake and piercing. By no means is this always a "clean" sound that people justify it as, it is just pronounced and distorted. I listened to an acoustic piece first, it sounded alright, and crisp. But then I listened to Dragonforce & Sonata Arctica... I couldn't concentrate on the music because of the highs resonating in my ears. Jazz sounded a little better on my ears, but you have to like it crisp and not warm sounding...
I want to take it back, but I don't want to more on a restocking fee...
If you can get your hands on a Zune or a 5.5 generation, please go for it, I spent 15% restocking fee to learn this lesson. Listen to the majority of reviews!!!
edit...

ok so you can kinda resolve this in the EQ.. but because its preset.. you have to deal with it being muddy or something else.
also....

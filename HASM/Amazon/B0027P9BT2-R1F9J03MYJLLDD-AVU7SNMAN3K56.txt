Title: Great Computer!
Content:
It is a great purchase.
It traveled to Costa Rica, and when I got it, I installed Windows 7 Ultimate on it. It works like a charm.
Great computer. The 4gb of Ram will prevent your computer from stucking in a process. No matter how many processes you are running.
Batery lasts less than the promissed 4 hours.
It is an all purpose computer. It works for anything.
Highly recommended.

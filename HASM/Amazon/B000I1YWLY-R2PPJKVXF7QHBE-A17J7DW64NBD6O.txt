Title: Electorlux  Twin clean bagless canister vacuum
Content:
I am just a mom of three and I like the bagless because with our house traffic we would have to purchase a bag weekly.  This vacuum has great suction as long as the canister is kept empty.  I have not had the clean filter light come on yet but when the suction seems to be decreasing I clean out the canister and its great again.  I love the self contained filter cleaner but again, I feel like it needs to be cleaned before the light comes on.  The clean filter light has not come on yet.  I have been dumping the canister each time I vacuum and the filter about every 2-3 vacuums.  We have a ranch house about 2000 square feet.  The vacuum is also much quieter then the Hoover bagless I had before.  I feel like my house is cleaner.  I also like the canister better then the upright for two reasons.  1- it fits better under furniture.  2- I don't run over the cord as easily.  I also love the retractable cord but it would be nice if it was longer. 
Overall I lover the vacuum and would buy one again.

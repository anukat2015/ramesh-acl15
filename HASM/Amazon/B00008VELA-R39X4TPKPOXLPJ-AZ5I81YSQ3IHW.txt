Title: Can make excellent beans taste horrible
Content:
I bought this to replace a Gevalia coffee maker that i broke the carafe on. No matter how i ground/measured the coffee in this maker, I could not get the coffee to come out tasting right. The beans and filters i use are top notch and I have had no complaints using them in other people's coffee makers. My one thought is that the water heater they use may not get the water hot enough to extract the flavor from the coffee. Unless you don't mind good beans that end up tasting like Folgers, i'd go ahead and pick up something else.

Title: Great and Affordable Product for Single cups
Content:
I bought this product because my sister had one and I was so impressed with being able to easily brew just one cup.  It also will help with my electric bill since it cuts off as soon as the coffee is brewed.  I don't need the "keep warm" feature.  Oh, yea...the coffee is great!!  The permanent filter was a disappointment since the finer particles were left at the bottom of my cup.  I use the Melita cone #1 filter which eliminated that problem.  However, if the filter or its holder are not placed just right, you can get coffee grounds in your cup, or the hot water misses the filter hole and may splash everywhere but in your cup.  This was an easy fix.  I just have to pay attention to what I am doing when preparing my cup of coffee.  NOTE:  I did have difficulty finding the #1 size filter.  Most places were sold out.  I went to Amazon and was able to buy a case of 12 boxes (40ea) for about 3 cents each filter.  Even with shipping that was a cheaper price that at the grocery store.  I have no doubt that I will use each and every one!!  I also have peace of mind that I won't run out anytime soon!!!

Title: Heats well but tips over too easily
Content:
This little heater does a good job of heating small areas, even on the lower setting.  But, and this is a big problem, it tips over when virtually anything touches it.  My cat rubbed against it gently, when it was off, and over it went.  Another time, I brushed against it and, again, it tipped over.  It's obviously top heavy.  I wish I could give it a better review but it's instability is potentially dangerous, even with the tip-over switch on the bottom.  I simply don't trust it, so back it goes.

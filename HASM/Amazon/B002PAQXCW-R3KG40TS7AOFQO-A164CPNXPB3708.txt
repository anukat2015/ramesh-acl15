Title: great laptop
Content:
This is an great laptop, especially when considering its price.
Great boot speed, and has handled all the games I've thrown at it (so far)
Love the 1080 resolution, allows me to fit so much on the screen at once.
Some text can be a bit too small to read, but most modern applications have ways of increasing the font size.
My favorite is browsing the web at this resolution, I can easily scan the whole page ( so much screen real estate ) , and when I find something that looks interesting I can either get closer to the screen OR just increase the page zoom level to 125%.
My biggest complaints are: no blu-ray, low volume and the keyboard sensitivity is ok, NOT great ( especially bad when using key combinations like Ctrl+c )
The built in DVD drive is upgradable to a blu-ray drive ( comes off easily with two screws on the bottom, no need to open the laptop case )
The keyboard experience can be easily improved by using an extenal keyboard ( which I plan to do, since I live off Ctrl+c / Ctrl+v for software development )
For normal typing, the keyboard works great for me.
Use headphones to get around the low volume problem ( when ambient noise warrants it ) .

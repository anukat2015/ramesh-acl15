Title: Looks-5 stars, function-1 star
Content:
I did a lot of research before buying this unit.  After 4 months of use I am very disappointed with this product.  This is definitely the best looking coffee maker I have ever purchased, but that is where the complements stop.  The carafe dribbles all over the counter top.  I have found this to happen even when I pour VERY slowly.  My carafe is also very finicky.  It must be placed perfectly or the drip mechanism is not engaged and coffee and coffee ground pour out of the top.  BIG mess.  Unfortunately, the complaints do not end there.  The steam from the unit condenses behind the carafe and creates a big puddle every morning.  And to be quite honest it doesn't really brew that great of a cup of coffee.  So if you want a good looking machine, this is for you.  However, if you like a functional machine that is convenient and brews an awesome cup of coffee keep looking.  I know I am.

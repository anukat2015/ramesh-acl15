Title: Big Improvements!
Content:
Ordered this new Bosch Tassimo machine on-line directly from Tassimo.  Same price as Amazon at $139.99.  www.tassimo.com. We have been using it for about a week now and I absolutely love it!  We had used the Braun Tassimo machine for about 5 years and the new Bosch has much improved the Tassimo coffee maker.  Here's a list of the Improvements:
1.  It's narrower and doesn't take up as much counter space
2.  There is a power button on the front of the machine so you can easily turn it off at night.
3.  There is essentially no water warm-up time.  It is almost instant after you insert the T-disc and push the green button.
4.  It is extemely quiet.
5.  It even makes the coffee a little stronger than the old machine did.
6.  It does not collect waste water that you have to empty all the time.  Only the few drops of coffee that don't make it into your cup are collected.
7.  Much better filtering system. It also has a change filter indicator to tell you when its time to change the filter.
8.  Higher construction quality, more solid feel to the machine.

Title: Almost comically bad!  It's terrible.
Content:
Bought one of these from Woot and gave it as a Christmas gift.  Spent about 2 hours trying things, reading support stuff on the internet, trying new things, and finally giving up.  First, the Gevalia Coffee Pod Brewer wouldn't prime as the instructions said.  Hints from other buyers said it needed to be reprimed 15-20 times before it actually started to pump water.  Once that got going, it took about 25 cups worth before it would output clean, clear water.  It seems that the culprit responsible for both problems is too much grease in the tubes during assembly.  I really hope it's a food-grade grease or oil.  As we were starting to get clear water out of the machine, it decided to quit metering the water.  It doesn't matter which setting is chosen, the 6, 8, or 12-oz size, the machine will run through the entire reservoir of water and try to keep going.  While furiously pumping water it seems the pump itself moves more water than the rest of the machine can handle as water leaks from base of the machine and runs all over the counter and onto the floor.  What's most surprising to me about this is that other buyers describe the exact same issues with the Gevalia Coffee Pod machines they bought.  I'd think it has got to be a crazy isolated incident with all the problems in one unit, but no!  Lots of buyers on the Woot forums have these issues.  We've boxed this machine up and have ordered a Senseo machine.  I sincerely hope it's a better product, and I hope I can get a refund on the Gevalia.

Title: I think this coffee pot could be a fire hazard.
Content:
I had this coffee pot for just over a year.  It functioned consistently well up until that point.   I liked how fast it brewed coffee and the ability to pull the pot out while brewing to pour a cup, but you can get these features with a lot of coffee pots out there.  My biggest complaint up until it broke was that the plastic around the glass carafe easily stained and was a pain to keep up with.  
After the coffee brews, there is two hours until it automatically shuts off.  What happend with mine is that after two hours the little red light would shut off, but the pot remained on and kept heating the coffee.  It had to be unplugged after using for safety, and that was kind of a deal breaker with me!  It would not have been appreciated if I had gone off for vacation and had the pot remain on while I was gone.  
I feel that this coffee pot is way over-priced for the amount of use I got out of it and  I will not be buying this brand again.  If you already own one, keep this electrical problem in mind.

I ordered my ITOUCH 32GB a few days ago and Amazon got it to me in one day with free shipping and gave me a better than Black Friday price due to some problems I had with ordering. Great customer service!!!!! The ITOUCH is beautiful.....my son is trying to take it from me as I gave him my old IPOD. Now he wants one. My hats off to Apple for making such a wonderful device. I am not tech savy so it took me a while to figure things out as we share three ipods on one computer, so managing downloads for each device (as we all have different tastes in music) is a bit of a pain. But after several hours I figured it out and loaded my favorite music and a bunch of free apps. My only issue is my hands are so big that the ITOUCH feels very small and I am afraid to drop it but I am sure I will get used to it. Amazon gave me 5 bucks in MP3 downloads and I immediately used it.....amazon made it very easy to download MP3's into my Itunes so it was hassle free. Its a beautiful thing.

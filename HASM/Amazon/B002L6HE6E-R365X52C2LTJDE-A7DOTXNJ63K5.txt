Title: Great Product
Content:
Overall, I am satisfied with this product. It is easy to use and I like the features. I don't really like how fast the battery seems to drain, though it seems to charge pretty fast. If it is locked, it will last for a few hours. iTunes is also easy to use and they take you through a tutorial if you want to learn how to use your ipod. I like the music options; I can create different playlists to suit my mood or activity. I also like that I can find music by album, artist, title, playlist, etc. which is very convenient. I love that it has an FM radio because I listen to the radio a lot and the ipod also identifies the song title and artist for some stations. But sometimes the stations don't always come in clearly. I would love the video feature if I just learned how to use it. I like that iTunes is also on the computer, so you can listen to your music on the computer, as well; the ipod doesn't have to be connected to the computer to listen to the music. I don't use the video camera feature; i wish that I could take pictures instead (although there is a setting where you can save your pictures downloaded from your computer to your ipod-you just can't take pictures with your ipod). I like that you can also rate your songs and have the option of home sharing (can share songs, etc. between computer in your house). I also like that the ipod is really small and although I've dropped it a couple times, there are no scratches or glitches yet. Paying about a dollar for each song you download really adds up, though, so just be aware.

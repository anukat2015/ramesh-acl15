Title: Outstanding purchase
Content:
The heater arrived quickly, and it does a great job of warming our 14' x 11' room that's not part of the central heating. That lets us use the room immediately in the morning, and open the door to that room and leave it open after a few minutes without adding load to the central heat. We were considering their next lower model, but the reviews here convinced us to move up a step. Am I glad we did! The noise is noticable but acceptable, and the fan can be turned down pretty quickly.

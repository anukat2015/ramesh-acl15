Title: thermostat does not work, remote control button overly sensitive
Content:
As others have mentioned, the thermostat only measures temperature in the immediate surrounding area. So it shuts off constantly when in thermostat mode.
The remote is a nice feature, but the button is overly sensitive: a little touch may make the heater go through the whole cycle of turning off, turning on.

Title: CNN describes it as "klunky";  no ecosystem built around it
Content:
This 30 GB system is even bigger than Apple's 80 GB video iPod.
Hardly any accessories are built for the Zune, no airplanes are installing video adaptors and power adaptors for the Zune, but they are for the iPod.  Same with cars.
Wireless function is severely hampered.  You can get a song "squirted" to you only if the other person gives you permission.  Even then, you can only listen to the song three times or for three days, whichever comes first.
DRM is even more strict than Apple's Fairplay.
Why bother with the Zune?

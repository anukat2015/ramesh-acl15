Title: Disappointing
Content:
I'm a Mac fan through and through, some might even call me a Mac fanboy. When the new Unibody Macbook was made available I foolishly went out and bought it, the glass glossy screen is by far the worst quality screen in the Apple lineup. Its almost like a mirror, if you work/play in an environment with any ambient light or even the smallest light bulb you will see the "mirror" like properties. 
Overall this is something that I can not ignore, I cant use this notebook in my office due to the lighting or in my house. Apple should consider investing in some higher quality screens, and also think about offering a "matte" option.
My old iBook and Powerbook are far superior to the new Macbook in terms of usability. Overall I'm very disappointed with Apple's cost cutting methods. This was a company that cared about its consumers and was known for its outlandish design concepts.

Title: Great mid-size computer
Content:
This is the perfect computer for business use.  The screen is not too small (net book or IPAD) and not too big (15" or bigger).  Full size keyboard and long battery power (more than enough for a one hour presentation) due to low power processor and LED backlighting.  HDMI output is perfect for connecting to my 55" HDTV and restaurant HDTVs for seminars and other presentations.  Imagine carrying a very lightweight computer (around 3 lbs) plus you do not have to carry a projector and screen AND you do not have to look around for an outlet to plug in your laptop and projector (not to mention carrying a long extension cord).  
Lastly, it's a Toshiba !

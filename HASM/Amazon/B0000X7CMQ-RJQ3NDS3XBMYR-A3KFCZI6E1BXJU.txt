Title: Excellent all-around coffee maker
Content:
We were not familiar with this brand, but wanted a high quality thermal coffee maker with a black/stainless finish, and this looked like the best choice.  So far, we're very pleased with it.  It's simple to use, well made, coffee tastes great, nice looking, and reasonably priced.  Only drawback might be the sight glass being on the side vs. the front, but that's a minor inconvenience, depending on how much counter space one has.

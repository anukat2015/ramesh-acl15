Title: Will keep a well insulated home/room very comfortable.
Content:
Because the digital sister model SLP3310 would not work with a timer, I returned the 3310 to the big box store where I bought it and bought on-line 2 of the SLP3300 for $60 each & free shipping.  The 3300 is analog, with 2 rotary dials.  The 3300 will come back on after a power outage, and it will work with a 3-prong, 1875 watt timer.  I use the 'low' heat setting with the thermostat on a modest setting, in a 12 x 14 foot room with 8 foot ceilings, and it keeps my (well insulated) bedroom very, very comfortable.  Although Sunbeam has a lousy reputation in electric blankets, this 3300 heater appears well made.   Note, the 'high' setting could burn paint off a wall if positioned too close.

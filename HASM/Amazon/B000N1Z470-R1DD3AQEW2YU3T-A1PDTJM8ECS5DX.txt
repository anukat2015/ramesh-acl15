Title: Not the Best Heater I have seen
Content:
This heater to me is okay. I had a hard time putting the stand on to where it will not lean. I don't know if that is just a problem with this one or if all have that problem. The remote control is a nice feature but I don't really feel the heat coming out as much as I think it should. The unit is pretty quiet.

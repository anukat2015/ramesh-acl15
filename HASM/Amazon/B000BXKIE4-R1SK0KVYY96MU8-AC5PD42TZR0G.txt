I have to say, I really didn't know how well my vacuum was not working until I took a big leap and bought this vaccuum.  I consider myself a pretty clean person, thoroughly cleaning the house about once per week.  I have always had an upright, but since I have a 2 story looked into the canister.  This vaccuum is so quiet and easy to carry.  It is a bit odd to pull the vaccuum behind, but the the job it does and the ease I can change the tools from floor to cleaning the blinds is great! I have a thicker carpet higher pile carpet, which I was concerned about the cannister based on reviews, but this Vaccuum automatically adjusted itself and really sucks and digs into the carpet.  You don't feel the need to continuously go over areas that are higher traffic because it does such a great job the first time around.  Pet hair is no problem for this vaccuum.  Also I am a longtime allergy sufferer, and dust and allergens are not kicked up like they typically are.  I also use it for all hard floors and it is great.  For stairs and car vacuuming I highly recommend the powerbrush attachment.  Before purchasing it, I was leary on the price because for me that is quite a bit of money.  But I am so happy with it, it was well worth the dent in the pocket book.

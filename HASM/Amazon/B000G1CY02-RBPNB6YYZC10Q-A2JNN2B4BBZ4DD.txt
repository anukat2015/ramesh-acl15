Title: Great absolutely silent space heater
Content:
I needed an overnight substitute for my efficient but noisy fan disbursed
central heating system. I bought 2 of the HP 1500s and am delighted. They
are dead silent but quickly disburse enough thermostatically controlled heat in a bedroom or living room to maintain heat overnight without noise so I can sleep. They also look good.

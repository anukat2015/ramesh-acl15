Title: Almost perfect.
Content:
Love the iPod.
Pros:
Sound & picture quality great
Ease of use
Portability
Cons:
Back casing has a hard plastic feeling. Doesn't feel like metal at all in my opinion, but it is according to the Apple website. (scratches very easily)
Battery life
Earbuds are large. The don't fit into my ears well.
All-in-all a great buy.
*edited to state facts. I stated the back casing was plastic when it is in fact metal.*

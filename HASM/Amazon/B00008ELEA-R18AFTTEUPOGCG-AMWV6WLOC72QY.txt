Title: Just missed it's second birthday
Content:
I've had this percolator for 2 years and it's been largely a disappointment.  2 issues over time.  
The first was the quality of the coffee.  Over time I noticed that the coffee was becoming weaker.  This was most evident by the color as I would add creme.  I battled this by adding more grinds.  Not sure if that helped immensely, but it made me feel better.  
The second was that the base with the heating element became somewhat warped and was not meeting the body of the pot cleanly.  This was leading to water getting into the element despite my best effort during cleaning.  
Then last night, it up and died after just short of 2 years.  Last night was December 23rd.  That meant I had to go buy a new coffee pot on Xmas Eve in absolutely horrible driving coniditions.  I picked up a Presto 2811 this morning.  It got very good reviews here so I thought I'd give it a chance.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  Happy Holidays!

Title: Great Value for the money

I wouldnt count on one of these keeping an entire house warm in the winter, but the room i use it in is pretty small  and it does a really good job. The adjustable thermostat is a bit touchy though, there is only a hairline difference between too hot and not hot enough. took a few days to find the sweet spot but since i have it works better than i could have hoped.

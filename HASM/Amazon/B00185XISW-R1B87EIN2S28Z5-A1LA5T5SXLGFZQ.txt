Title: Safe & Effective Heater
Content:
For Christmas my Grammie received an Eco-Heater for her sun-room. This room, an extension of her house, wasn't well insulated during finishing. Even with two heat ducts, the large windows transfers cool temperatures indoors. Her space heater, loud for its size, managed to create hot spots without affecting the rest of the room and posed a danger to my children as they played. 
The Eco-Heater has been the perfect fit for her needs. It's a quiet, no burn risk which effectively heats the entire room without creating hot spots. It mounted easily and can be painted to blend seamlessly to the wall. Below are manufacture description and the answer to why this is a [...] Product of the Week. 
- Convection technology generates heat behind the unit, drawing cold air into the 3/4-inch gap between the heater and the wall and releasing about 90 percent in an up-draft from the top of the unit out into the room, with only 10 percent radiating forward from the front of the panel 
- Uses only 27% of energy that a typical 1500 watt heater, the equivalent of four 100-watt light bulbs 
- Top concerns with heater safety are the possibility of a fire. ECO-heaters have no exposed elements or areas for dust accumulation; therefore, the risk of fire is almost nil 
- Although the heater is hot to touch, it will not burn the skin if touched

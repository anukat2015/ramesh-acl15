Title: Absolutely Terrible
Content:
This has got to be the worst coffee machine we have ever had. It is nearly impossible to pour the coffee out of the pot without it spilling all down the side and onto your counter (or hand, whatever) Also, when the coffee brews, it spits and sputters all over the place. We have papertowels underneath our machine and it is staining our countertops.
Absolutely terrible.

Title: Fully Loaded Laptop at a Great Price
Content:
I decided it was time to upgrade my laptop and looked for several weeks for the right combination of price, hard drive, RAM, Bluetooth, battery, numeric keypad, etc.  This laptop has it all.  I thought my replacement laptop would be a second Mac since I bought a Mac for my wife six months ago.  However with Windows 7 getting good reviews and a price one-third of the cost of an "equivalent" Mac, my decision was what PC did I want.  The DV6-1350 has all the features I was looking for including the new DDR3 RAM instead of DDR2 and Bluetooth.  I also like having the 12 cell battery pack attached. The extra "bump" on the bottom doesn't bother me.  Ergonomically the keyboard is great. My last laptop was an HP and I am pleased with the reliability.  I am really liking Windows 7 in it's functionality.  It starts up almost instantly from sleep mode.  This is great laptop at a very good price.

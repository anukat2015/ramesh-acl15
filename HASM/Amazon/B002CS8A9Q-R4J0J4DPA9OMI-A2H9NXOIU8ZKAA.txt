Title: Easy to use and will last for some time.
Content:
EASY. This cold brew system is really easy to use and clean and not having to buy replacement filters and cheap plastic parts makes this the cold brew system for the long run. I noticed that I only have leak issues if I overfill the unit with either coffee grind or water. You need to ensure the measurements are exact. The hour glass is actually functional for an optional mid-brew flip and flip back which i found did give the coffee a bolder taste in less time. The coffee tastes amazing and I was able to give up cream and sugar as a result. The container was perfect for taking to work and storing on a tight shared refrigerator shelf

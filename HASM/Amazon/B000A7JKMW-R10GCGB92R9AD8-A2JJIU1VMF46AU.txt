Title: Sony WILL be supporting KM dslr users!
Content:
The 5D is a great camera packed with a ton of features. Reviews have all been very good to excellent. Nobody else offers an in camera Anti Shake solution (image stabilization). The CCD is a Sony CCD and the same one as in the Nikon D50. 
Konica Minolta has sold assets associated with dslr technology AND production to Sony. Sony bought, not just the technology and patents that go into KM's dslr's, but also the production facilities and lens mount. Konica Minolta's employees will be producing Sony lenses and dslr's. Sony has COMMITTED to support and service existing KM dslr owners. They also COMMITTED to produce lenses to fit the existing lens mount. There are over 14 million lenses in circulation for the lens mount Sony just paid good money for. Sony would not have purchased the lens mount unless they intended to use it. The story is bad for Konica Minolta's film slr's, not for dslr's. Do yourself a favor and research this topic on the KM slr forum on dpreview. 
I received my 5D this week after the news. Many 5D owners see the sale to Sony as a huge positive. More professional prospective users of the KM 7D are concerned because they are looking at investing thousands of dollars into their business. But for the amateur, the 5D is still a good choice....if you can get a hold of one! Most places are quickly selling out.

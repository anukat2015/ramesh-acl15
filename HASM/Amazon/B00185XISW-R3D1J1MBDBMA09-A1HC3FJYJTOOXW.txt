Title: Useless Junk!
Content:
I tried this for under two weeks, mounted on the back wall under my desk - totally useless even for my limited needs.  My Kill-a-Watts meter says my 1600 watt heater, which I am back to using, is actually cheaper to operate.  When I pulled this useless heater to return to seller, the ceramic was already separating in one corner.  USELESS JUNK!

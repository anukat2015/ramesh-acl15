Title: Single serve coffee maker
Content:
This coffee maker is a work of heaven.  Makes one cup of coffee at a time which for some is a pain but in this house hold is perfect.  My husband is the primary coffee drinker.  Allows me to make a single cup without wasting a bunch of coffee grounds and water.  You can use your own favourites with the gold foil filter or you can by prepacked K-cups.
Easy to clean.
Looks nice and works well.  You can vary temperature setting and cup volume to customize your coffee experience.  Comes with a premeasured scoop for reproducible coffee each time.
Easy to fill water reservoir.
Only con is that it is somewhat loud while warming water but it is nothing obscene.  Does NOT wake me if my husband uses it before work.
Would recommend to friends and family.  Purchased at Bed Bath Beyond with the 20% off coupon.  Cheaper than Amazon.  Used reviewes from Amazon before making my purchase.

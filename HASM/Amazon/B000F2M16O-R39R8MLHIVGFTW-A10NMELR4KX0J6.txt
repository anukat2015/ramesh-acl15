Title: After many other coffee makers, this one has not disappointed
Content:
The machine works great.  Just pour in milk and twist the knob for foam, anyone can do it. Other machines have the steam "stem" and you had to have a good technique to get good foam, this one is idiot proof. 
 The auto foaming only fails when we use heavy cream.  Milk, Half and half etc all worked perfectly for us.  What happens when it doesn't and what the others mean by "leaking" is that the machine combines steam and Milk from a "Milk reservoir", if whatever you are using is too heavy to be sucked up through the straw, it will slowly just push from the top and eventually "leak" from the front of the machine.  It gives plenty of warning because if it doesn't start dispensing foam within a few seconds , then something is wrong.
We mainly use ours for coffee and foam.  Which is does well, you don't need to have the espresso handles on the machine as there is a turn valve that eliminates the "dummy plugs" with other machines.  
Like anything under $400 these days, it's mainly plastic so we're hoping to get at least a year or two out of it.  The foaming mechanism is clever but could be improved to avoid the "leaking" that sometimes occurs, but overall we would buy this one again over any of the others for the price range.

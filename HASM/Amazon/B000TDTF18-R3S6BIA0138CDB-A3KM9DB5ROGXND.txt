Title: Replacement carafe
Content:
I am very pleased with the DeLonghi coffee maker for all the reasons stated by others.  But you may want to consider this before purchasing one.  Because I have a penchant for breaking carafes, I decided to have a spare on hand.  The only source that I could find is the company itself and the bottom line price is $32.  For a pot that costs $50?  This is my first and last experience with a DeLonghi product.

Title: ~*Yowza!*~

Wow..!  I just received my new Hoover canister vac and I'm adding my review to the others.  This vacuum is stupendous.  The suction power is *amazing* - it could suck the stripes off a zebra!  It was very easy to assemble and the canister itself "follows" beautifully on its wheels from room to room. Long retractable cord, long hose, nice assortment of attachments and relatively quiet.  I debated getting a Dyson, and I'm glad I chose this model instead!

Title: OWNED FOR THREE YEARS, JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE
Content:
I have read several reviews of this coffee maker, good and bad.  I would have to say to all those folks who are having problems to be sure you are using it properly.  People are complaining of water dripping down the back because of filling issues.  Use the water hose from your sink.  The water that comes down the back, 99% of the time is from the condensation after the pot has brewed.  The simple fix for that is to tap the top a couple of times before you open it.  I  brew about 3 pots a day with mine and have never had one problem.  However, I understand like all electronics there are going to be some some duds.  I am sorry for those who have received one. But overall for the price the design and the flavor that comes out of this machine, I don't mine buying a new one every 3-5 years. But I haven't had to buy a replacement yet just bought one for the office now.

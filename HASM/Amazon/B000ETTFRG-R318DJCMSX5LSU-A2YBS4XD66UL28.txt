Title: Daughter LOVES it
Content:
Bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  She LOVES it.  Great price $150 from Amazon.  From what little I've seen of Ipods works basically the same.  6Gb should hopefully last her a while.  Expandable with SD card if she goes over 6Gb.  The screen is bright and beautiful.  The scrolling menu is sharp.  She's had no complaints.

Title: Great camera for casual photographer like me
Content:
I love this camera. It is pretty small, can do everything you'd expect from a quality SLR etc. I am sure it isn't as durable as more expensive cameras, and its lack of an AF motor in the camera body might scare off people using older lenses and stuff, and obviously its sensor is much smaller than a top-of-the line model...but if you want a (big) step up from a compact digital camera, you won't be disappointed in this one.
Also, do read reviews from people who know what they're talking about regarding megapixels vs. sensor size. There are pretty good sounding arguments for buying this one as opposed to the D40x. Having not compared the two I cannot vouch for one over the other based on experience, but the reviews I read convinced me this one was the better choice for me and I really haven't been at all disappointed.

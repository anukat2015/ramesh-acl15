Title: Love it
Content:
Battery life is worse than some competing products, but other than that, this is the netbook/laptop/whatever to get. Great screen and the processor and video adapter are brilliant. Team Fortress 2 runs very well at 1024x600 and the recommended settings. I'm chuffed to bits.

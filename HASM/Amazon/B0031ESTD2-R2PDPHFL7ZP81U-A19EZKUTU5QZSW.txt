Title: Love the display, but hate the fan
Content:
Just received this. I had ordered this for myself. I was debating between this and the Gateway EC1433U. My wife owns a Gateway and we love the Gateway. I just thought I will find something better. But I was disappointed. 
First the pluses. I love the display on the Toshiba and its keyboard. I also like the placement of the keys better than the Gateway. I also liked the touchpad and the mouse clicks on the Toshiba better. 
Now the minueses: I hate the fact that the fan turns on frequently on the Toshiba. Even if I am just using the browser to view static pages, the fan turns on and its not super quiet. So I can hear the fan. If I am using Youtube, the fan is on almost throughout. Over time, the bottom of the laptop on the left was also getting hot and I could feel it on my leg. 
In comparison the Gateway is super quiet and the fan is NEVER ON. I am going to return this and buy the Gateway instead. Sorry Toshiba!

Title: Beats a laptop PC
Content:
Love the efficiency and ease of use right out of the box. First time I have had an Apple Mac and will likely replace all other PC's in house with a MAC in next couple of years. Programs and menus are easy to navigate for all levels and most of all I love the startup time that is seconds compared to minutes I experience with PC's. A nice touch also is the power cord with the magnetic connection to over avoid damage to laptop if someone trips on cord. I'm told (but have not installed) Microsoft office does not work as well on Apple compared to PC's but this is not the primary use for this anyway. I wanted something relatively light for travel but great for media viewing & downloads and ease of use. This fits the bill perfectly.

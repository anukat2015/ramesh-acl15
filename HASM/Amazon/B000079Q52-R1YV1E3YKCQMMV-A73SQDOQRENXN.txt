Title: Best bet for large spaces
Content:
Feels like you are taking a sunbath...even in a 55 deg warehouse. It heats you, not the air. You feel the heat instantly.
Most air portable heaters are 1500 watts and up. The high setting on these is only 800 watts. They save money and feel warmer in open spaces. We set up several to surround workstations otherwise you really notice your warm parts versus your cold ones.
Not the best solution for lounging around the house...it really is bright.

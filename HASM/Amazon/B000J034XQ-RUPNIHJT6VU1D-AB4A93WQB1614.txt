Title: Disappointing
Content:
After reading reviews of several coffee makers we decided on the Black & Decker Smart Brew DCM2500.  We had no problems with the unit so far as operation but our purchase was placed into service 12-14-2007 and it brewed it's last pot of coffee on 4-10-2008.  A total of less than 4 mos. service and the heating/brewing element quit.  For the cost of shipping, etc. (even tho' it's under warranty) it's not worth the hassle.  We would also be without a coffee maker for whatever time it would take to have repairs made under the warranty, so we'll take our $30 loss and find another brand (locally) where we can haul it back to the store next time.

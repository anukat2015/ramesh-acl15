Title: Sharp has HORRENDOUS customer service.
Content:
Ordered this and it arrived broken. Seven weeks later I still do not have a working unit as Sharp procrastinated on the repair, then decided that it had to be replaced, then sent the wrong unit. No one at customer service knows what's going on and I have to wait on hold for 40 minutes each time before someone tells me they'll call back -- and then they never do. Worst experience I've ever had with a company -- and this is a very cumbersome and important item in one's home. Absolutely stay away from Sharp. I see another reviewer had a similar experience.

Title: Pretty good deal
Content:
I got this vacuum for $64 the day after Thanksgiving. I think it works very well, I only use it on the carpets in my house (I have a Shark for the tiles and hardwood). I like the adjustable handle, it is pretty comfortable to hold with the loop at the top. I do have a couple of complaints: (1) it does emit a strange smell everytime I run it, almost like burning rubber but I have checked everything. (2) the electrical cord. I wish it were longer as I have to keep plugging and unplugging when I change rooms and my house is not that big, but where you have to wrap it up is really cramped.
I got a deal on this vacuum I couldn't pass up, next time I'll get the Dyson DC07 I really wanted.

Title: Extremely Clean!!
Content:
Never thought I would love my vaccuum sweeper, but I do. Inherited an old Kenmore from my father when he passed away and that's what I was using for WAY too long. This Wintunnel made my carpet look new the first time I used it. Ease of switching from carpet to wood floors right on the handle is wonderful! The filter keeps my air clean while using. I used to be able smell dirt with my old one. Yuck!! So very happy with my new Hoover!!

Title: Fantastic versatile coffee maker
Content:
Love this machine. My favorite coffee maker by far. It's so versatile and convenient. The only con is that the coffee is quite expensive by comparison to a regular machine. But that shouldn't be too much of a surprise. The convenience of not having to mess with coffee grinds and filters outweighs cost. The iced coffee feature is fabulous. I've tried making iced coffees at home with my other machines and they never tasted very good. This machine does the trick! It also doubles as a great espresso if you so desire. I love being able to accommodate so many different tastes when company comes over. You can't do that with a carafe machine (not well anyways).

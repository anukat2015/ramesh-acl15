Title: Machine itself is great but Windows 7 not so great
Content:
This Toshiba is lightweight and the battery lasts a long time.  I even love the red color.  However, it's too bad that it comes preloaded with Windows 7 because had I known how many problems I would have with Windows 7 and office 2007, I wouldn't have pruchased it and spent the money to fix my old laptop with Wndows XP.

Title: Love this DSLR
Content:
After years with a very expensive Konica / Minolta DSLR and watching the business go over to Sony I agonized over the decision to stay with it because of my considerable investment in not just the camera but also several lenses. Finally I decided to switch to either Nikon or Canon. I wanted to be with a company that would stay put.
I spent considerable  time "researching" i.e. reading lots of literature both in print and on line and actually handling cameras. My conclusion was Canon or Nikon, makes no difference. I liked the features of the 50D, a step up from the Rebel but not so expensive as the top of the line Canons. I didn't need video capability, so this camera just hit me as the one. 
Amazon had a very good price and I am comfortable dealing with them so my decision was made.
As to my older expensive equipment, that is one good reason to have adult children. My son was thrilled to get it.
So far, I love this camera. If you want to let the camera make all the decisions you can set it, relax and just shoot away with very good results. If you want to be creative, the possibilities are "endless". 
I have yet to discover all the potential this 50D has and am still learning. The point is that you can enjoy it right out of the box and then take your time to learn all the cool stuff the camera is able to do.
If the 50D is within your budget, get it. You should love this camera.

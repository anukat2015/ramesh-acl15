Title: Good idea not for people with small children
Content:
The design of the KRUZ is attractive and it moves easily getting into spaces other vacuums can't reach.  However, it is really only for picking up dust and hair.  You have to keep going over and over the same area for food crumbs, small bits of paper, etc. and even then does not get it all up.  Bottom line - it needs to have more suction!

Title: My husband loves this Vacuum
Content:
My husband loves to Mow and Vacuum, similar kinds of things I guess, but we researched and researched for a great vacuum.  He wanted a canister vacuum and after reading others comments on this vacuum we decided to buy it.  I really wanted an upright but I told him if he really wanted a canister then he had to do the vacuuming.  It worked and now he has his canister vacuum.  Don't worry I still have to do laundry and dishes. lol.  It is SUPER powerful and not heavy like many canister vacuums are.  We couldn't be happier.

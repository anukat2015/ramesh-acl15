Title: Nice reasonable coffee maker
Content:
This really is quite a nice coffee maker.  I had bought a cuisinart, which I did nothing but fight with.  Apparently defective.  And decided to try this one, for the price.  I am pleasantly surprised.  It does what you would expect it to do.  It makes a decent cup of coffee rather quickly.  It is not complicated.  I don't like to feel like I need an engineering degree to operate my coffee maker.  This one is simple.  IT has a clock, can be programmed.  OH, MY FAVORITE THING.......IT HAS A CARAFE WITH THAT LIP THAT DOESN'T SPILL ALL OVER THE COUNTER AND THE FLOOR. It has a permanent filter, that doesn't clog every minute, it is easy to keep clean.  I do not use a paper filter too, I just dump the grounds into the filter. I would recommend this to people,

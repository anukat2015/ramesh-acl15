Title: the thermostat flaw
Content:
this thing is basically good for about 10 minutes.
the thermostat thinking the room is hot is one of the most annoying things ever.
i wish i could find the thermostat and disconnect it, but i can't.
it worked fine for about 1 month. no real thermostat issues.
then one day, it wored like total garbage.
buy something else.. this is not worth $20

Title: Faulty design - poor service - unacceptable support
Content:
We purchased a Hoover bagless canister in May 2004. After about 6 months the electrical connection between the hose and wand broke due to a very poor design. We took the vacuum to a local service center on 12/31/04. It's now March 15th and we still do not have a working vacuum. The local Houston service center failed to return our calls three times despite repeated promises. We were given the same incorrect part TWICE - once from the local center and again shipped from the central Hoover customer support center. We were told that the parts are back ordered from North Korea!
I will say that the central customer support center personnel were helpful and positive, but it's been almost 3 months and still no resolution.
We are very disappointed in this product and the support and we will not buy Hoover again. The vaccum is poorly designed and if you repeatedly disconnect the hose from the metal wand to use the accessories, the connection will break. Also, the unit is described as having a HEPA filter, but about 25% of the exhaust gas leaks past the filter out the back of the unit!

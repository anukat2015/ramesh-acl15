Title: The best camera I've owned.
Content:
I was attempting to upgrade from my xTi and found the 40D to be a really great suit for my needs.  I could not justify the additional cost of the 50D for my use, but I was not at all disappointed with the quality of this proven veteran.  I have found the Camera to be very user friendly and unintimidating.  It's ease of use invites you to try more creative shooting techniques and the results are almost immediately rewarding.  There are also many reference books available to walk you through some of the more intriguing features.  I love the camera.....can't put it down.......I look forward to every weekend shooting opportunity.  I never seem to be anything but totally pleased with the results.  This camera makes me look like a pro, and I'm a budding amateur, at best.

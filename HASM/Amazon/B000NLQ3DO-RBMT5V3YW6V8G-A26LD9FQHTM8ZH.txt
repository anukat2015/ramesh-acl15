Title: I'd pass on this one...
Content:
Within a couple weeks of getting this coffee pot, we had an overflow incident.  All over the counter. Then it would brew only half and stop.  So I read the manual and did the clean cycle, even only after this short of period.  It would work okay for awhile, and then do the same thing.  Or often grounds are in our coffee or tea.  Cleaning it doesn't help any more.

Title: Great desktop replacement!
Content:
Purchased this as our first laptop.  It is great!  Nearly full size keyboard and the number pad is a great plus.  It is large so we will probably not travel with it very much but obviously could if we needed to take it with us.  Screen size was the driving reason for making this purchase because the larger size makes viewing very easy as our eyes are not as good as they once were.

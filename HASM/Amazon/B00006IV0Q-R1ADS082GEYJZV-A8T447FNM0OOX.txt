Title: DON'T KNOW WHY I WAITED SO LONG
Content:
I grew up with perked coffee.  Then along came "drips" and we were all convinced this was progress and just bought newer models every couple of yrs.  One day an elderly couple served me perked coffee fresh from the pot and I remembered what a good cup of coffee tasted like.  This product gives me a fine, delicious, HOT cup of coffee every morning, and keeps it HOT.

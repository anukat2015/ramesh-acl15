Title: Cleans well when it stays together
Content:
We received this as a gift several years ago, and it does a five-star job cleaning our hardwood floors. We have two dogs and two kids, so it gets a lot of use.
So why only three stars? The pieces don't stay together. In order to vacuum, I have to hold the metal wand and the hose together so that they won't fall apart.

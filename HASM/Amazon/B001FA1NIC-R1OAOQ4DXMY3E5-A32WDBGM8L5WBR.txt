Title: My husband is a convert, now!
Content:
I got my first iPod three years ago & have turned into an iPod addict.  (I got the first model iPod video and have three Nanos since I am a long distance runner.)  Over the past couple of years, I'd keep asking my husband if he wanted one.  "NO" he'd say adamantly with a scowl on his face.  Well this past Christmas, I went ahead & got him one (black, 8gig 4th gen), along with the cassette adapter, so he can play it in his new Jag convertible.  ;-)  I loaded it up with every artist & song I could remember that he'd like.  He opened it up Christmas Eve & became mesmerized.  I woke up Christmas morning & he was already up.  I walked out into the family room & he's got the earplugs in & dinking with it.  He also travels alot & has used it alot on airplanes or in the airport.  It was a big hit & he's now a convert!
I've got a 1st gen, 2nd gen & 3rd gen Nano & love the look & feel of this one over the previous gens.  It feels smaller in your hand than the 2nd gen but it's really only b/c the edges are smaller.  (In the middle, the size is the same.)  It's more scratch resistant than the 2nd gen & does not have the chrome backing that the 1st & 3rd gens have (looks nice but much like a stainless steel kitchen appliance, will show EVERY fingerprint.)  
Since this is my husband's iPod & I almost never use it myself, I cannot compare using this iPod with using previous gens of iPods (IE accelerometer, etc.)
The reason I only gave this 4 stars is b/c it's not compatible with previous iPod charging cables or any alternate power sources (IE Battery packs, docking stations)that work great with all my other iPods.  Apple!  WTF???

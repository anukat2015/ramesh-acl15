Title: Student/Work computer
Content:
I will start of by saying I looked at alot of computers before buying this one.  I like this computer like the reviews say it is fast has alot of little extras like hdmi port, remote, touch volume at the top, blue tooth, good sound for a laptop, looks real nice, webcam, and windows 7. Windows 7 does rock from sleep to awake this laptop takes less than one second and all I do is sleep the laptop so it is allways instently ready. 
I like everything but the screen you cant tell looking at the screen alone but but hook it up to your LCD flat screen and you will see how much better a screen could look. You might say it is not fair to compare it to a tv so I also compaired the screen to a mac laptop screen mac's have way more vivid and deeper colors and I put it next to a MSI screen I insently saw a big differance in compairing screens. Dont believe me try it put it next to a MSI or mac look at the same picture on both screens you will see HP could use some more vived deeper colors. My other complant is there is allways a fan running you wont here it at the stores it is to loud in store to hear a little fan but take it home you will hear it, it is not loud but I would just prefer fans to run only when the computer is working hard.  
Hope this review is helpfull if it is please recomend it.HP Pavilion DV6-2150US 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black)

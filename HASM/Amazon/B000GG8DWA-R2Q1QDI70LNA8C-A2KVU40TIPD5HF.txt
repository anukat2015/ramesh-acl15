Title: Best choice for open spaces (otherwise use ceramic heater)
Content:
The Infrared style of heater is great for really big rooms or rooms that can't be fully closed off because it heats you directly without heating the room.  This is not only one of the less expensive ones, but is actually better than more expensive ones (like the one that looks like a fan because it uses a fancy dish to focus the heat).  The power consumption is low enough that you may be able to use 2 on the same circuit, and on the low setting that only lights up one of the two rods, you could easily put 3 on the same circuit.  Since it only heats you on one side, you will probably want to use 2 or 3 at a time, or combine it with another type of heater.
This product works well when used together with a ceramic heater in larger rooms.  The ceramic heater will raise the air into the 60's, and this will let you feel like it's 75 or warmer depending on how close you get to it.

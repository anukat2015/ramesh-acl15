Title: Really brings the "heat"!
Content:
My husband likes hanging out in our garage/basementette. It gets cold down there in winter and we needed a heater that really projects the hot air accross the space, and not just if you're sitting directly in front of it. We also didn't want a propane set up, which many are.  It's great. Does a wonderful job. I'd highly recommend it!

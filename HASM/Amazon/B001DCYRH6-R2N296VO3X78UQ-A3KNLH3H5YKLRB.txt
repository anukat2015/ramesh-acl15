Title: Exactly what I wanted
Content:
I would rate this 5 stars but have only had it for 2 months, so can't judge durability of the motor. I have an upright vacuum for carpets and needed something with the attachments, reach and flexibility for other cleaning and dusting chores. I settled on this Hoover Commercial Portapower Vac after a couple of hours of research on a number of vacs in this general category. Its solid construction, including the hose, wands and attachments, impressed me right out of the box. The wands and attachments attach securely and will not detach in use, yet are easy to attach and remove. It is powerful and versitile, from bare floors to nooks and crannies, to reaching the average ceiling without standing on a stool. The reusable cloth bag is sturdy and easy to remove and insert. The 33' foot cord is akin to a decent outdoor use extension cord in quality.
It is designed to be carried by the handle or included shoulder strap. It has no wheels. I wish the shoulder strap was padded but that's easy enough to add yourself.

Title: Buy Something Else, This One Stinks
Content:
My husband and I paid a breathtaking $100 for this coffee maker when they were fairly new on the market. Once every 6 months it would plug up and spew water all over the counter when it was supposed to be brewing coffee in the morning. Cleaning it was a nightmare (take it, turn it upside down over the sink and irrigate it until some tiny coffee ground dislodged from it's guts). My husband and I spent hours getting the coffee pot to work again. 
The entire thing is due to some really stupid engineering. You don't fix it up so that the ground regularly plug up the water reservior. 
This morning was the last straw. I took it outside and threw it against the concrete walkway behind my house and watched gleefully as the wretched thing exploded into plastic and bent aluminum pieces. I can truly say that was the most satisfaction that object ever delivered to me.
I am going out today and buying a decent brand of coffee maker and never ever wasting my money on Cuisinart again. 
By the way, my Cuisinart food processor broke recently because the safety catch on the top lid came off right at the spot I predicted it would break. I knew that there would be too much stress on a thin and small part...guess what, I was right. 
So, from my experience, Cuisinart is just an expensive name. Go out and get a Hamilton Beach food processor or a Kitchen Aid coffee maker.

Title: My camera was bad?
Content:
I used it for 3 days and did lots of pictures.
I owned before this one Nikon D50 and what beautiful pictures the nikon did.
I used this one. and i did not get any decent ones.
probaly i read it could be the lens? 
i dont know but i return and got another nikon. I just love nikons. maybe its me to be a nikon fan.

Title: Eureka 3684F Pet Lover Mighty Mite
Content:
When my previous Mighty Mite died after 20 years of loyal service I decided to see if they were still made. I was happy to discover there were new improved models and after reading mulitple online reviews, I went w/Pet Lover model. Since I have 2 cats I can't be without a vacuum, so I ordered from Amazon in case I needed to return and because of free shipping. My new purple Mite arrived within a couple days and I love it! Has great suction, is lightweight, compact and efficient. I'd highly recommend this versatile, space-saving machine.

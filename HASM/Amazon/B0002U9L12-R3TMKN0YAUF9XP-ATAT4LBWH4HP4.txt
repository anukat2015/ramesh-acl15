Title: I love this coffee pot
Content:
I bought this coffee pot about six months ago after my first thermal pot developed an electrical problem.  I searched for thermal coffee pots all over town and the internet before choosing this pot. I chose it because of the price, and the design.
I do freelance editing work, and often drink coffee while I am working very early in the day.  The thermos is wonderful because after brewing, the coffee maker shuts off.  There is no heating element, so the coffee stays hot for several hours without boiling/ evaporating away.  I can make a pot, and have fresh, hot coffee for several hours.
I seldom use the programmable features, and I don't really need a clock on my coffee maker.  I would probably buy a pot with fewer bells and whistles if I could find the thermos I liked.  But for the price, this is a great choice.

Title: Great vacuum
Content:
I read all the consumer reviews before buying this vacuum and agree that the Electrolux Intensity is a great little machine. It's stylish and folds down for easy storing, but it has strong suction for such a small vacuum. 
On the downside, the dust bags are small, so I purchased a bunch of extra ones. If you have wool area rugs, it will fill the bags up fast. However, I still prefer it to my 2 previous bagless vacuums.
The retractable cord is an excellent feature, but it's on the short side. And as someone else had noted, the wheels are kind of 'tight' making it hard to push around - mine is like that too, but I think it's becuase the wheels lock when it's in the upright position. 
One final thing - there are no attachments for this vacuum, but for my needs it's not needed. I would definitely buy this vacuum again!

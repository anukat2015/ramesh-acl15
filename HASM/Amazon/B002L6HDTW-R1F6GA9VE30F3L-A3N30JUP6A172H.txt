Title: A Must Buy!
Content:
GAMES
Varied ....
Suprisingly deep ....
Extraordinary graphics ....
CD quality sound ....
When I think "iPod Game" I always expect the BreakOut-level stuff that is the 1st iPod easteregg.
I was really really taken aback by the quality of these iPod games.
TEXT
Yup -- you can store .TXT files of whatever you want.
I've turned PDFs in .TXTs ta have somethin ta read now & again
and it really comes in handy.
MUSIC
Lots of different playback modes, EQ settings, etc.
IMAGES
Just choose PHOTOS on the menu & hit the PLAY part of the clickwheel
and you have an instant slideshow -- with diffrent transitional styles! -- with
whatever music you want as accompaniment.
VIDEO
This is what sold it for *me*.
The quality of the video is ASTOUNDING!
Is it HD?  No.
BUT, is ir rocksolid crystal clear, especially when played on YouTube [in normal mode!], 
your computer, a DVD & so on?
Oh yes -- absolutely!
COUNTLESS special FX, easy to play/pause/stop ....
The iPod Nano with camcorder is, top to bottom, a DEFINATE Must Buy,
at the price make GREAT Christmas gifts, and although lacking in InterNet
& calling, is a solid rival to the iPhone & iPod Touch.

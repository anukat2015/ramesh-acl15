Title: Real Value
Content:
Just recieved the S3590 and was very pleased..  This tracks well and is easy to move about the house.  The insulation is done well and noise is sufficently damped.  A light on the power head is nice and the suction is great.  I shopped vacuums at 3 times the price and was not impressed.  Only negative is the accessory holder is awkward and the dusting brush is a little small.  Buy this product.

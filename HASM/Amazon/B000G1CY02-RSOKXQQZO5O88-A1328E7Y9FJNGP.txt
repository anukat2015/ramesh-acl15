Title: bought 2, both working well - recommended
Content:
I've been using two of these heaters in different rooms for about 2 months now.  Both are still working well and are silent except for an occasional soft click or pop when they turn on and off.  
The high settings pulls 1500 watts, which is almost what most household circuits are rated - it causes lights to on the same circuit to dim noticeably in my house which was built in the early 90s.  Because of this, I tend to leave it on the lower 750 watt setting, which works fine for a little extra heat in a room.
I do recommend running the heater on high for at least 3 hours outdoors or in a garage to get rid of the smell before using it inside.  After doing this, there was no noticeable odor from the heater.
I do wish the heater included a digital timer and thermostat.  Since it does not, I'm using both with the LUX WIN100 - basically a plug in thermostat - to control the heater.  That allows me to have the heater automatically heat the room to a set comfort level in the day and essentially be turned off at night when we're sleeping.  Not strictly necessary as the heater does have a rudimentary heat adjustment dial, but I would recommend getting the LUX thermostat to use with the heater instead.

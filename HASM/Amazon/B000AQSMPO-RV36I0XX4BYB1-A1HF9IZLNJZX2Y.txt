Title: I own
Content:
We have this product in our home, no problems after a year. No beeping, no leaks etc.  My husband bought this at a local store and paid the same price if not more.  The coffee pods are more $$$ in our local store and another web site I used then Amazon. It takes maybe 10 seconds to get a quite brewed cup of coffee. My old drip coffee maker made more noise as it finished brewing. Love this coffee maker.
The only problem we have with it, is when we both want a cup of coffee at the same time.

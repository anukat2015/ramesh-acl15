Title: Best mp3 Player
Content:
Wow! I just got my Sandisk Player and it's really cool. It has lost of features such as subscription compatibility, an FM tuner/recorder, voice recording, and photo and video playback into a compact and durable device. I love the tactile navigation wheel. 
And unlike the ipod you can actually remove and change the battery. Another cool bonus is that I can store mp3 on Micro SD cards, then load them on the player as I see fit. Hence, this give this player unlimited storage capacity. Great player

Title: Best Coffee Maker ever owned
Content:
Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Programable Auto Brew 12-Cup Coffeemaker, Black
Like other purchasers, I looked at all the reviews here prior to buying this coffee maker about 4 months ago. I went ahead and bought it in spite of the many negative reviews. I'm glad I did! I make a full pot every day and have not ever had an overflow problem. I wash the brewbasket, carafe, and carafe lid after each use and put the lid back on (make sure the "pour" label is pointed at the spout) and it's ready to go for the next day. Coffee stays hot all day long. As soon as the coffee is brewed the light goes off and you stop using electricity to keep the coffee warm - the carafe takes care of that. Like most things, if you follow the instructions, it works great! I highly recommend this coffee maker.

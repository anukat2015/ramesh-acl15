Title: You get what you pay for. . .
Content:
I'm a review reader and had second thoughts before buying this heater.  A lot of the reviews said the heater wasn't very strong and the knobs weren't clearly marked.  I figured people were just trying to use it to heat a large room and maybe didn't read the directions about the control knobs.  I was wrong!!  We have a very small bathroom and this heater does not warm it up.  If you stand within 2 feet of it, you can feel heat otherwise it's worthless.  I set it so that it will keep the room as warm as possible and the heater still shuts off after just a few minutes.  The controls are very poorly marked and the directions could be clearer.  If you are looking for something to place at your feet and keep them warm, then this is a good value.  If you want something to warm a small room, I would suggest looking at another product.

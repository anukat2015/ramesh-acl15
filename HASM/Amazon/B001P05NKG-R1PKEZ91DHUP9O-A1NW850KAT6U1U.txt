Title: best laptop i've ever had
Content:
I've had many laptops, the last three macs.  I've had many desktops, the last four macs.  This little laptop is one of the best all-around computers I've had, and by far the finest laptop.  The size is perfect for traveling.  If this were my only computer, I'd probably be complaining about the screen size, but for my uses it is just right.

Title: Excellent DSLR, with bad start
Content:
During the first month until the Auto Focus stopped working, I was very impressed with this DSLR and Nikkor lens.
Then suddenly the AF would not respond in the middle of outdoor shooting. I am waiting to hear what Nikon service center has to say. Searching a bit on the web I could read other D300 owners complaining about the same fault.
If other people write about this issue I can guess this is not a rare case of technical failure, but rather a sign of insufficient manufacturing and quality level -and this should not happen with a camera of this class. So overall I am disappointed with Nikon.
Update after repair:
Nikon sent back the camera after about 2 weeks, which is ok since I had no urgent need for it. They were not very specific on the cause, just noted that the body had been repaired - the lens was ok.
Another positive comment on Nikon's repair center: they had the courtesy to send me an additional battery. This is GOOD customer service.
Since then the AF is working fine and I am very pleased with the cameras capabilities and quality of the photos. On the performance scale alone I give this camera the full 5 STARS.
I am leaving the first part of my review because I still believe Nikon's manufacturing / quality system for such a camera has proved insufficient. And evidently this is not an isolated statistical occurrence. Obviously there is pressure to hit the market, but it must not come in place of extensive testing and trouble shooting of new models.

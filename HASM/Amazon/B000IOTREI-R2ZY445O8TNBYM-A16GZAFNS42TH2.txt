Title: Presto HeatDish - A Great Investment!
Content:
I have had a Presto Heat dish for a little over a year and think it is amazing! The restrictions that are listed in previous reviews are really the same restrictions you would find with any portable heater (keep away from children, at least three feet away from furniture and curtains, etc.). I live in an old apartment that is not the most energy efficient. After trying several different space heaters I found the Presto Heater and have been Highly Satisfied with its performance. Yes, it is very light weight, but that doesn't make it unstable. Also, if the heater is knocked over or even picked up it lets out off a loud annoying buzzing sound. So even if it is somehow knocked over (which I haven't had happen in a year) you will know it instantly. The heat it produces is amazing and it has several settings (low scaling up to high) so that you can find the perfect level of heat. I find that it is great to point directly at a spot, but after about a 1/2 hour it will heat my living room or bedroom (both pretty good sized rooms). I also haven't had any problems with the unit overheating. I generally run it for 12+ hours (all evening and all night) and haven't seen any kind of dip in the performance. I would highly recommend the Presto Heater to anyone looking to reduce their heating bills, in fact I plan on ordering a second heater for multiple rooms.

Title: New style Shark han held vacuum
Content:
Plenty of power, but it does not come with, nor is there an optional wand to use while standing up.  If it came with a wand, to allow the user to operate it while standing up, it would be better than the earlier models, with less power.
BUT, the wand is only 4 inches long, the user has to crawl on hands and knees to use on the floor!
Not a buy for older folks.

Title: Decent vacuum
Content:
My husband and I purchased this vacuum about 6 months ago. Key things we were looking for: something with attachments that did a better job than our previous vacuum picking up cat hair from our carpeted cat tree, as well as kitty litter from our hard wood floors.  We also wanted a vacuum that would work well on hard wood as well as carpet.  We bought this canister vacuum after researching and reading various reviews. The vacuum does a much better job than our last canister did on carpet. It also does a better job picking up hair from the cat tree. It doesn't do as good of a job as we'd hoped on our hard wood floors in general. If we run it slowly over the kitty litter it does a decent job of picking up most of the litter. However, my husband typically just uses a broom to sweep up the litter since he finds it easier. The head of the vacuum is a little on the bulky side, and I frequently have to clean out my long hair from the roller since it gets caught wrapped around the roller and causes it not to function as smoothly. We empty the bagless dirt cup every time we use the vacuum (we have a 3 bedroom apartment). It fills up fairly quickly. We use the brush to clean out the reusable filter fairly frequently, and rinse it out/dry it well every month or so, and it seems to still be working well. As far as vacuums go, this one seems decent, though not perfect, but I'm not sure we'd find anything better for the price.

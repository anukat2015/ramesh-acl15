Title: Good Name; Bad Appliance
Content:
I had the KCM514 model (12 Cup) but otherwise identical.  It was recalled after a few months and replaced.  I was just as happy because this coffee maker was constantly overflowing all over my counter-top and into my kitchen drawers.  You could not leave it alone.  It had to be watched constantly.
As other reviewers have said, the pot must be placed in just one critical position which, by the way, is NOT the position of the pot on the cover of the Instructions.  Then as mentioned, if the pot is wet and empty, the internal lever will push the pot back on the slippery warmer plate and it will overflow.
It may have quality materials.  It may look good.  But, it's not an art piece; it's an appliance.  It is a bad design and KitchenAid has not bothered to correct their mistake for going on five (5) years.  Apparently, it is cheaper to just keep replacing them when customers complain under warranty.
What eventually happens is that the constant flood of coffee into the workings of the maker will cause the electronics/heat element to fail.  That's the infamous "Err 2" which KA says cannot be fixed.
I also agree that the Customer Service people are friendly and helpful.  It's the product that sucks.

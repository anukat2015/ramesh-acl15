Title: Ipod Touch is good, just do not buy from Amazon!
Content:
I ordered this item December 11th directly from Amazon (not a secondary vendor) with a "guaranteed"  super saver delivery by Dec. 24th.  It shipped Dec. 14th, and that was the last time the shipping data was updated.  Come Christmas, and no gift for my son.  I e-mailed them and they said..."it must be lost".   I asked for another to be shipped on an expedited basis.  They said they were out of stock.  So they refunded my money...but of course now I am not allowed to leave feedback about the terrible service.  Of course now it shows up in stock.
Finally on the 28th, the first one showed up out of the blue (still does not show up on tracking).  So I e-mail them to ask about sending it back (I am an honest person)...still no word from them 3 days later.
I ended up orderings from Apple...a little more expensive, but it came on time!
I used to really like Amazon, but now I am definitely thinking they are going down the tubes.  Too bad.

Title: Worst Heater on earth
Content:
This is the worst heater available in the market. Don't go by the looks and end up buying a sloppy product. Initially, I found it to be good but after a couple of months the thermostat won't work, and finally itself did not work.Also the product is real danger when it comes to static clothes near the heater.
Please dont waste your money on this product.

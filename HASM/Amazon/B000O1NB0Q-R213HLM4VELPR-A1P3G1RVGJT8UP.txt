Title: All the bells and whistles you can ask for plus some!
Content:
This is one heck of a Notebook / laptop. The 18.5" screen is wonderful and the fact you can have 2 Hard drives is great. I also like having a ESATA port available to connect an external drive with a lot better performance then USB2. Performance is good and Vista isn't really a lot different then WXP and didn't take much getting used to. This isn't a notebook your going to do  lot of traveling with but if you want a great machine with all the features and no wires to connect plus the ability to move around a bit this is the Notebook for you. If you can find a notebook with more features then this at a price close to this I'd be surprised.

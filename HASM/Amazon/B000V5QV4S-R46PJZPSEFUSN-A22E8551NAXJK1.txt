Title: Great pro-starter camera.
Content:
This is a great camera for someone wanting to get started in professional digital SLR photography. It's going to be a great backup camera for us as well, it does decent in low light and not much issue with noise, though 3200ISO is pretty much unusable due to the high noise, but 1600ISO is quite acceptable if you have to get the shot. Great price now too and well worth it. Though I don't understand why people buy these cameras thinking they'll do better than a point and shoot if they're never going to take it out of Auto mode, and never going to by an external flash. If you plan on using this camera like a point and shoot consider getting the G10 instead, as it's an awesome little pocket camera and does right for the job! :)

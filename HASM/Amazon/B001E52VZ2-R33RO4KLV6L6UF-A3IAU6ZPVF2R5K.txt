Title: It has everything I like
Content:
I finally found a vacuum i like! I recently figured out that the upright vacuums I usually buy are not for me.  I had bought an oreck and got the buster buddy free...well the oreck upright bit the dust while the buster buddy trekked on. I decided I wanted a buster buddy with wheels...and i found this vacuum  It is very lightweight which is great  It has wheels so you can pull it along, and it really works great I usually buy high end vacuums and this one can beat the bag off of any vacuum.  It sucks so hard it pulls the carpet up a bit..and talk about pet hair. With two angora long hairs i have to vacuum every day.  The head has a fabric which is like the old hand  lint removers we used to use. One person mentioned that it felt "cheap" It doesn't feel that way to me..I believe it is made to be lightweight but is is very sturdy Aside from it working so well the best thing is it does not hurt my back to use it like my old uprights

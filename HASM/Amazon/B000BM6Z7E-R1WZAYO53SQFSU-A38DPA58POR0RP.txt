Title: Could have been great....
Content:
Nice screen, standard mini USB cable, nice sound, good battery life, replaceable battery.
Could be great but for a number of annoying failures:
  - Can't view photos and listen to music
  - Does not show up as a drive on windows (must allocate space to be a drive)
  - Can't play tracks on device on your computer, must copy track to computer drive.
  - No star ratings for songs
  - No way to flag a now playing song as "good"
  - Can't charge on computer and play music at the same time.

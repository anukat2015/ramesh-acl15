Title: Heater has 1 flaw.
Content:
I just ordered one of these heaters last week. It arrived in half the time that was quoted and was in perfect condition.(Packed tightly & box not busted up.) This is the fourth heater like this that I have purchased. (The previous three were purchased from Walmart.) I use one in each bedroom of the house. It is very quiet and will heat a 15x15 room to a warm temperature if it's 25 degrees outside. It is so efficient in heating that I rarely use my central heat for upstairs during the winter months. The flaw is in the thermostat. It doesn't work correctly. That's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.

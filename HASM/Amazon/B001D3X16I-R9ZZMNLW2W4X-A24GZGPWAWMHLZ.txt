Title: Awesome little MP3 player
Content:
Bought it for my daughter who loves to sing, dance, and play the music on my cell phone. We bought it for her first birthday and she's had it for a month and so far hasn't broken it. It's been eaten, stomped on (by a 22lb baby), and thrown and still works great. The sound quality is awesome. It gets way louder than I expected. It's easy to use. The computer software annoys me but it's easy to work with. It almost always skips one song on each CD that I've put on there. I would understand if it was the first or the last but it's usually like the 6th. I don't know what that's about. But I love it.  
We don't use it for the screen but it has a nice bright display and is easy to read. I don't know how nice it is to watch things on. 
The only thing I have a problem with is the size. I think it could have been a little bigger.

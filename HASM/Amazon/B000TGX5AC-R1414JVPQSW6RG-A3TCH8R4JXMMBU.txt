Title: Good heater, but not as good as the previous model
Content:
I recently bought two of these. It doesn't heat even a small room nearly as well as the previous HZ 519 model. Don't know why that one's no longer available. It's a shame because it was the best little heater that I'd found. This one is shorter, but also taller, which I don't like. The previous model was lower and longer...less obtrusive in a room, and I believe that this is why it heater better.

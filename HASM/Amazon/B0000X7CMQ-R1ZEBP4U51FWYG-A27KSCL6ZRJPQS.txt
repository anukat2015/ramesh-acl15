Title: Don't be duped!!
Content:
Don't be duped by the 4-star rating, it's not reflective of this product at all.  Here's why:  1) the brew pause function (to pour a cup while it's still brewing) does not work- it dripped coffee all over the plate each and every time I tried to do so; 2) the carafe is not well designed-coffee dripped down the side of it and my cup; and 3) the "ON" button stays lit after the brewing has finished, so monster-like sounds keep emanating from it well beyond brew time. (I had to push the "OFF" button a few minutes after the brewing had ended.)  In all, a horrible product, especially with the steep price.  For a point of reference, I am not a coffee snob like so many in these reviews.  Also, I was replacing a six-year old Black & Decker coffee maker that had seen its last day, but had cost $39.99 originally.

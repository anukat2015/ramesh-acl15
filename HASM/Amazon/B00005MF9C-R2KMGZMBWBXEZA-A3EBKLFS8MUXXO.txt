Ihave recently bought this item before  christmas .My husband used to get mad at me ,because i was going thru a 39 oz can a week . I like very fresh stong coffee . 
My advise to any body thinking of this to buy 2 ,that way you have a spare .
Its great. FANTASTIC .I NOW GO THRU A 39OZ CAN ABOUT EVERY 3WEEKS .THATS GREAT ,BECAUSE I HAVE A  FRESH CUP OF COFFEE ALL THE TIME WHENEVER I WANT .wITHOUT WASTING THE POT FULL.
BETTER THAN THIS ,I ALSO MAKE TEA AND HOT CHOCOLATEWITH IT ,MY KIDS LOVE IT.

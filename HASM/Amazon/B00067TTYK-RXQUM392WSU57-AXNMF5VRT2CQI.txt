Title: Exceeds the Ipod
Content:
I compared the Zen Micro to the Ipod. It's plain out better than the Ipod in these areas:
- battery life and convenience
- sound quality!!!
- extra features (fm, voice recorder)
It's relatively the same in "user-friendlyness". For all those people debating about the better design, they are both well made and look nice ... it's up to personal preference. Just let each customer make up their own mind about the aesthetics. Don't get me wrong, the Ipod is a good player, but there's too much hype and overall, I believe the Zen Micro is better. Better sound, battery and more features, what more can you ask for?

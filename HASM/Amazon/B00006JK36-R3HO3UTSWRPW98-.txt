Hi, I'm a professional who's making the switch to digital for some things and I bought an S2 to hold me over until the D2H comes out.I want to comment on some of your points:1) The autofocus noise is a characteristic of the lens -- not the camera. A 70-300 sounds like a plane taking off on any camera, not just an S2. I have several silent wave lenses, and they focus as smoothly on the S2 as on my pro film bodies.Also, you mention that the S2 can take 7+ frames per second (FPS)-- actually it can only do 2 FPS. I think you're referring to the D1H.2) I think most digital systems eat batteries. I don't use the rear display often, so I manage several hours from my S2 with the default battery setup that is the camera default. I also use a Quantum battery pack, and have never been disappointed. Sure it's heavy (like you said -- carry an external flash -- the pop-up flash is just as bad as all of the other pop-up flashes out there), but pretty much all modern pro SLR systems are heavy. People wonder why my Nikon FM-2n is still my favorite camera!I'd give the Fuji 5 stars -- the only thing I completely hate is the "feel" of the camera. It's "plasticy" -- doesn't feel like it has the same build quality as other pro cameras. I wouldn't feel comfortable shooting with it in the rain, for example.If this system was rubber armored, with a little higher build quality, I wouldn't even be considering a D2H next year.

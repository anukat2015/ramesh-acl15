Title: Really Cute, But You Will Need an Owner's Manual
Content:
It is about 1 inch square, has a built-in clip for your shirt or gym shorts, comes with a USB cable and ear buds, and is reasonably priced. I have only had it a short time, and do not know about long-term reliability. Still, I like it a lot and do recommend it. 
First problem: the included earbuds are pretty mediocre. If you are serious about music sound quality, you should use high quality earphones.
Mainly, though, is the "User Manual". The one in the package has several, rather obvious mistakes. I went to the official Sylvania website, clicked over a few times, and wound up at the Curtis International website. There, I was able to download the correct manual in pdf format. 
Mainly, I could not figure out when the player was finished charging. The pdf manual has the answer: there are 2 LED's. The LED next to the on/off switch simply tells you that the USB cable is getting juice; the LED next to the earphone hole will turn off when the internal battery is fully charged.
I have since figured out that this thing, when plugged into a powered external USB hub, only requires a couple of minutes to fully charge.

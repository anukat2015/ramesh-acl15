Title: Even better than expected
Content:
This heater works very well. I had another small heater that sounded more like a lawn mower and only had a single setting - blazing hot. The Lasko heater can be heard, but it doesn't make that same loud choppy sound one would expect. I didn't even notice it after a while. And the adjustable thermostat is not something you would expect in a $20-$30 heater. It is definitely a deal. I plan to buy a second one this week.

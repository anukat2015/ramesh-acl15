Title: Had it for two years now and still lovin' it!
Content:
I have had my Cuisinart thermal coffee maker for two years and love it. While some people have commented that the coffee maker is difficult to use, I have not found this to be the case. You just need to be sure that you have screwed on the lid to the carafe correctly, and there are directions on the lid to help you with this. My coffee stays hot for hours in the carafe. As far as customer service goes, I can't say enough about Cuisinart. I recently noticed that there were black flakes in my coffee. Upon further inspection, I found the black flakes appeared to be coming from the carafe. It appeared that there was a black lining in the carafe that was flaking off. I emailed customer support through the Cuisinart web site and describe the issue. Four days later I received a phone call from a Cuisinart service rep. She explained that the inside of the carafe is made of stainless steel and that the "black lining" I had described was actually coffee residue build-up. All I needed to do was run vinegar and water through the coffee maker and let it soak in the carafe. I was pleased to learn that my carafe was just dirty and was absolutely amazed by the fact that someone from Cuisinart actually called my house to tell me this!

Title: Not compatible with Vista OS
Content:
The iPod Shuffle is extremely small and cute, but iTunes is not compatible with Vista, yet.  I kept getting error messages when I tried to upload my playlist.  Apple has a repair tool, but I could not get it to run.  I'm sure it will work out eventually when Apple comes out with a newer version of iTunes, but waiting kills the excitement of having a new toy.

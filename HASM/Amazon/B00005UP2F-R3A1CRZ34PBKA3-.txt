Title: A waste of my money!
Content:
This vacuum is horrible!!!  I bought it to replace an old vacuum, which I had to kept so I can vacuum the filter from the new one.  I've had it 5 months & want to replace it.  The filter is horrible to clean!! It makes a terrible mess. The clips ment to hold the metal tubes don't work. It constantly comes apart.  The accesories never stay on when in use.  The compartment that holds the accessories is difficult to open (I don't even keep them in it anymore). If I could give it a minus 5 star rating, I would!!

Title: Plastic Shell and Loud
Content:
I bought this to replace an "ugly" one (my opinion anyway)  that my husband loves. It's old. When I got the new one up and running... I couldn't believe how cheap it was and how LOUD the fan was.... Since it is plastic, it needs a fan to pull the heat out of the back top of the unit so that it won't melt. The fan has nothing to do with keeping your warm. It's LOUD... you couldn't have this by a chair that you were listening to music or watching tv. I returned it. Now on to see if they still make some version of the 20 or 30 year old Presto Metal Shell heater. QUIET and WARM...

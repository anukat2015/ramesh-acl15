Title: Not good
Content:
We ordered this back in 2006 and didn't have luck with the unit either.  One key thing that made the decision on not to use this unit was that it made our aluminum window frames hot.  Not sure what this would do to our house we decided to send it back.  WAY TOO HIGH OF STOCKING FEE that we decided to try and sell it on our own.  Don't purchase this unit.

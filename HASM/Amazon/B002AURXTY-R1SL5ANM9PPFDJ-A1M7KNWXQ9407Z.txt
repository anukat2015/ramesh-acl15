Title: Sexy, thin, and M-azing!

OK!!!! Lets start! 
First let me tell you what I had before..... 
a Gateway P-6860FX
Specs:
C2D 1.83GHz CPU
4GB RAM 667MHz DDR2
GeForce 8800M GTS GPU
17" 1440 x 900 LCD
320GB HDD
 
Definitely a gaming laptop. And now I switch to the Acer Timeline.
Specs:
Pentium 1.3GHZ (single core) CPU
3GB RAM 1066MHz DDR3
Intel GMA 4500MHD GPU
15.6" 1366 x 768 LCD (LED backlit)
320GB HDD
Now this is an "extreme" change for me. Going from Performance to Portability. Some people might think, what the f**k are you doing? You can't play games anymore. NO GTA4, Grid, Crysis, Far Cry 2, NO NOTHING. But guess what? I'm not complaining. This "little" laptop is pretty damn awesome! Well It is a little underpowered but only if you try to look for it.
Of course I'm basing my experience with this "lappy" on Windows 7 RTM. It comes installed with vista and bloatware. So just make sure you get rid of that crap and you'll be happy. 
Here are my thoughts on performance....
Well actually, first let me tell you what programs I was able to run smoothly and define what "smooth" meant for each.
iTunes: Yes iTunes. And I think this is Apple's fault. My P-6860FX was laggy with iTunes. Now running an underpowered laptop makes things better? It weirdly true. 
Photoshop CS4: It's not fast, but it is usable. I works for most of your photo editing needs.
Ummm. Actually that's all I got to show off right now. I've only had it for a day or so.
Oh! lets talk about battery life!
As you know they never real last as long as the company says. Unless you dim it all the way down, no wireless, power saving mode, etc. But I was able to get about 6 and a half hours with Wifi on. So not to shabby.
Keyboard!!!!
It has a chicklet style keyboard. Very responsive, good spacing and a NUM pad!!!! How I love NUM pads!!! This keyboard is was very easy to get used to.
Touchpad:
It's has multitouch capabilities. I love the pinch zoom for photos. Works pretty well. But at times it does get a little glitchy.
Speakers:
There small and not that loud. They don't really give you a theatrical bass pounding feel. But they are very "accurate" sounding.
Design: 
All you have to do is look at the picture. It's very sleek and SEXY. I love takin' this around with me. And with ease weighing around 5 pounds.
OVERALL:
This laptop is totally awesome! 
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Title: Not worth the money!
Content:
I never got the Zune marketplace to work with this product.  After spending hours on the phone with tech support, they determined that my account had somehow been locked and could not be unlocked.  So, I had a really expensive MP3 player.  I sent it back when it wouldn't hold a charge when it was off longer than 10 hours.  Absolutely worthless.
BTW - I bought an IPOD and had everything up and running in 5 minutes.

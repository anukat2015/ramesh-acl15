Title: Pretty on my counter, but has design flaws...
Content:
I have a love hate relationship with this product.  I love the way it looks, but it has two major design flaws. After six months of use, I have learned to work around these flaws, but I would not recommend this coffee maker to a friend.
I have two issues with this coffee maker.  First, the burner where the pot sits is very shallow and if the carafe is not placed exactly right on that burner, the water will not drain into the pot but get trapped in the brew basket until it overflows all over everything.  When we first got this coffee maker, this happened AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.  Many, many times have both my husband and I thought it was placed properly only to come back and find coffee all over the counter and grinds in the pot.  I have become fastidious in noting the position of the carafe and so this happens to me only occasionally now, but it still happens to my husband a lot. 
My other complaint is that the water reservoir is at the VERY back of the coffee maker, and the water indicator is built INSIDE of the reservoir so that I have to pull the coffee maker way out and look STRAIGHT DOWN into it to see how many cups of water are indicated.  It cannot be viewed any other way.  I have learned to just measure carefully in the pot at the faucet, but why such a poor design?  It is inconvienient at best.
Since an upscale coffee maker like this is a significant investment, I think the consumer deserves a more thoughfully designed product for the price.  In my opinion, it's a classic case of form over function.

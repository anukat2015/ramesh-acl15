Title: Miele Aquarius S5580 with SEB 236 Power Nozzle
Content:
Bravo, couldn't be happier!!  I didn't realize I had indoor allergies until after using the Aquarius. I bought this vacuum initially because of it's cleaning performance, but thanks to the sealed hepa filtration, the allergens were removed as well.  This is the hepa/cleaning performance that I thought I was getting when I bought my Hoover Windtunnel, which was so highly rated, what a joke! I have the SEB 236 power nozzle for my medium pile carpet and my carpets have never looked so beautiful.  
I chose the Aquarius over the Callisto for two reasons, the auto suction control which eliminates all of the guess work and also for the +/- foot controls which eliminates the bending to manually change the suction speeds. The fingertip controls on the Capricorn are nice, but I felt that with the small controls bunched together on the handle, that it could possibly lead to another thing that could go wrong and the small LED pictures might be hard to see without glasses. 
Yes, my husband was in disbelief, shock actually, that one vacuum could cost so much, but I am pleased to say that he has recovered and is as pleased as I am with the beautiful performance of the Aquarius and with money well spent.

Title: My house was gross!
Content:
I REALLY like this vacuum.  It gets dirt I didn't know I had and a bunch I did know of.  It was easy to assemble.  Easy to use.  The biggest downside is that being bagless, you must dump the contents. For me/my house, that means 2 dumps per room.  I do have 3 inside dogs, 2 children and live in the country.  I am grateful this vacuum is actually picking up the leftovers from my previous vacuum.  I would recommend dumping into a nearly empty trash bin and doing so outside, as there is a lot of dust, and if you have pets, you'll need to pull any hair off the filter that accumulated there.  From time to time, you'll need to 'tap' the filter to rid it of the dust it has accumulated (again, outside).  Highly recommend this vacuum.  It is made of plastic material.  I haven't 'dropped' or 'kicked' mine, so I haven't broken the shell.

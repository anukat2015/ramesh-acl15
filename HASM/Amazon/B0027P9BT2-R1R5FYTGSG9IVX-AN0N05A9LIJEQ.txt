Title: NICE computer!
Content:
I was extremely glad to find this computer, as it's one of the few computers that still has a built-in modem. The best part, in my opinion, is a single, simple, one-touch button to mute the thing; I prefer my computers to be the strong, silent type. The only thing I'd change about it would be a white keyboard, which would be so much easier to see, but I'll eventually dig up a light for it. It's a GOOD piece of equipment!!

Title: Nikon D-80 with the 18-135 lens
Content:
I have had this camera a few weeks and it is very good. The 18-135 lens has one or two nits but overall I am very satisfied. I have been in Spain the last week and have taken hundreds of photos. The clarity is good and the night noise reduction works excellent. The camera feels better than my old D-70 and the quality in the photos is better. The only downside to the whole kit that I have angst with is using filters on the lens. The filters are very hard to attach and the screw adapter on the lens seems to be a bit small. I can attach the filters but it is not as easy as it should be. I would recommend this camer to any Nikon user upgrading or to someone new entering the DSLR game. Obviously if You are a Canon user or similar your mileage will vary.

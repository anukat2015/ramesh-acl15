Title: Great product!
Content:
The Eureka canister 3670G is a great product.  I have a good upright vac for my deep pike carpets, but I needed a small canister to replace my 15-year-old Dirt Devil which had served me so well.  All I wanted was a similar small, lightweight plastic canister vac for kitchen and bathroom tile and to clean out the car, etc.  After much searching I found the 3670G Eureka (12 amp).  It has great suction.  It pulls well and is so lightweight I can carry it easily up and down stairs.
One reviewer complained about the cheap tools--and that is right.  Really small and ineffective.  HOWEVER, most of us have saved tools from our old sweepers, so I am using the tools from my dead Dirt Devil canister.  They fit my new Eureka just fine.  
Aside from the cheap tools, it is a great product for bare floors, indoor-outdoor carpet and cars interiors. at a very low price.

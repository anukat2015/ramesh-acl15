Title: Head Over Heels for My Zune!
Content:
If I could rate my Zune over 5 stars, I would.  I had always wanted a Zune since their first launch, but 30GB was not enough storage space for my music.  So I bought an 80GB iPod Classic, which I used for over a year.  Being a fan of techno and electronica, I can't tell you how many songs sounded absolutely awful playing through my iPod - over premium speakers, no less. 
When I saw the Zune was being released as a 120GB model, I was so excited.  I sold the iPod on ebay, and headed over to Amazon asap to order my Zune.  As soon as it arrived, I was in love with it.  I'll list a few reasons why:
- The external design of the Zune is really sleek, and I love the matte black back plate.  The squircle is very responsive, and I love having a play/pause button and a back button.
- The screen is simply stunning.  Huge, with a crisp, bright display.  Videos, album art, photos, and wallpapers look great.
- The twist menu system is intuitive, and a whole lot more accessible and interactive then the iPod menu I was used to.  It's great to be able to move across the menu as well as down the menu.
- Audible.com compatibility.  I'm a big audio book buff, so having a device that is compatible with Audible makes it easy for me to listen to my books.
The #1 thing I love about my Zune is the awesome sound quality.  I created a test playlist of the songs I love that sounded distorted when playing on my iPod; they sound crystal clear on my Zune.  I was nervous about what the sound quality would be like without an EQ, but I've found with my Zune I don't need one - all the music sounds great, all the time.
This is hands down one of my favorite things I've bought for myself, and I can't recommend it enough!

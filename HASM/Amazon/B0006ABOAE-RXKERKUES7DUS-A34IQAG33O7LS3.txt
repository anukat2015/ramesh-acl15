Title: Love it!
Content:
I bought this machine based on the reviews I read, and I agree with them - this is an excellent purchase for the money. Having never owned an espresso machine - but having an unaffordable addition to Starbucks' soy lattes - I thought I'd give it a shot. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and a great deal. One word of caution - I couldn't get it to work with thse pre-packed espresso pods Starbucks sells. Overall an excellent value!

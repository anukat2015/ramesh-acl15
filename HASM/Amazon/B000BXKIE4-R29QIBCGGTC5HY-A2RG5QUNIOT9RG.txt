Title: EL 7020 Oxy 3 Canister Vacuum
Content:
Purchased this through Amazon about a month ago. Researched vacuums online and in local stores before making the purchase to replace a very noisy 10 year old Hoover upright. I had owned Electrolux vacuums previously and my family had owned Electrolux vacuums as well...a generational thing.
Love the suction, portabilty and quietness. It's so easy to carry. Cleaning is a charm in tight spaces,  under beds and other low furniture.
What's not so great: pricy bags. I'd like all the attachment on board in one place.
Initial operation took some getting used to ... but then, don't all new appliances have a learning curve?

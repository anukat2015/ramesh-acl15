Title: Love this laptop
Content:
This is my 3rd sony vaio laptop. I love almost everything about it.
The screen is very nice, bright and clear, blu-ray player, full keyboard, nice looking, speakers and etc....
It is like you have a portable desktop.
The down side is the weight, battery life and hard to find the bag but I got one from Amazon.com that is perfectly fit this laptop, it is Targus TLE400.
I have been using this laptop for about 2 weeks and haven't had any problem yet.

Title: Affordable and works wonderfully.
Content:
I bought this as a present for my mom and she loves it.  It's lightweight so she can slip it in her purse anywhere. She's also not a techy person so this MP3 is just the right thing for her since it has only a few buttons so she can't go wrong in learning how to use it. Transferring music is very easy and manageable through the computer. Sound quality is excellent and battery life so far has been good. It's definitely a good buy for the price.

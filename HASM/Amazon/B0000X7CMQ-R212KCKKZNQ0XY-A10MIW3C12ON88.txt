Title: Excellent Coffe Maker, HOT coffee
Content:
We were concerned about carafe coffee makers being able to deliver hot coffee.  This one makes HOT coffee.  I can't tell you how hot the coffee is 4 hours later, it's gone long before then.
 
Easy to use coffee maker, quiet during the brew process and easy to clean.  We bought this to replace our Cuisinart Grind & Brew maker, which we had to repair several times in it's 3 1/2 year life.  I hated that maker.  I called it the Tonka Toy, because you needed to play with it to get it to make coffee.  All the small parts needed cleaning and exact reassembling before the dang thing would stop beeping out it's error warning and actually get to the business of making coffee.  I stopped using the grind part of the machine long ago.  That was unbelievably messy to clean.
Anyway, we have had this delightful Zojirushi (how do you pronounce that?) for almost a month now and I love it's ease of use.  I don't need a coffee maker that grinds coffee, is preprogrammable or reminds me of my mother's birthday.  I want a hot, good tasting cup of coffee and this maker delivers it!  We love being able to take the carafe out on the deck and having our second/third cup of hot coffee right there, waiting for us!

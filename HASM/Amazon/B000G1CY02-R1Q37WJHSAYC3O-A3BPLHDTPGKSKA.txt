Title: DeLonghi Panel Heater
Content:
This heater is being used to supplement heat in a basement bedroom. Insufficient insulation in exterior wall, walkout basement, made this bedroom uncomfortable on windy nights. This heater makes no noise and has more than enough power on setting "1" to actually heat the entire room with the register closed, we were just curious enough to check. On top of it's ability to heat, the unit can be wall mounted or it is on a stand with wheels which makes it very versatile and very portable. We highly recommend this heater.

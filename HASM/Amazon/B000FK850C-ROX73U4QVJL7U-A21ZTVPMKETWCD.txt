Title: good heater!
Content:
I love this heater, it puts out heat immediately and warms up small spaces quickly. The best thing about it is that it has a remote, so the second you walk into the room, you can click on the heater, or in the morning when you wake up before you get out of bed. The reason i give it a four is because the function screen is REALLY REALLY bright, and is hard to read if you are looking at in from a different angle than straight on. I reccommend this heater, except for the light it emits !

Title: ITS WHATS INSIDE THAT COUNTS !
Content:
This heater was the replacement for a 35 year old arvin that broke its heating element. a co worker bought this heater just over a year ago and it never put out anywhere near what the old heater did  . well last week it went cold ,no heat just air . so i thought no problem ,we are an appliance repair co . i can fix it . well after opening it and finding out the the wires to the heating element are THIN ,THIN ,THIN . theres nothing to them  .and what had stopped it was a wire got hot and burned in two. if i had known how poorly this was made i would have never left it plugged in EVER ! i decided not to fix it, its a $5.00 heater inside and I will switch to a 10.00 used  goodwill special that i bought today its 30+ years old and still working ! no more of this plastic junk for me  ...... i wonder if all modern heaters are made this way ? and this one was a 100.00 dollar one ! whats a $20.00 one look like inside ?!

Title: A good choice for a small area.
Content:
We use this when working in the garage with an open door.  It doesn't heat the whole area, but if you stay in the flow of heat while working in close proximity it is wonderful.  For example, as we took down Christmas decorations from the outside, it enabled us to bring them into the garage, put them in their containers, deflate those that needed it, and store them away while remaining warm while the outside temp was in the teens.

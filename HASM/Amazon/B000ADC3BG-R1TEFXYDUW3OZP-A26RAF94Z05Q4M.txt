Title: I LOVE this heater!
Content:
I bought this heater because they keep the temperature so low at my work. Some days I can't even type because my fingers are so cold! I plug this little heater in every morning, and it keeps my cubicle nice and warm all day. I love that it has not only "Hi" and "Lo" settings, but also different temperature settings. The oscillating is another plus.
Note though, I don't plug this into my cubicle's outlet - that would more than likely cause a fire or power overload. I plug it into a wall outlet that is next to my cubicle.

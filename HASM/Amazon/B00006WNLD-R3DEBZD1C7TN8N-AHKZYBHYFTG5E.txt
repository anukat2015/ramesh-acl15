Title: Functional, no frills, average coffee
Content:
The product is as simple as a drip coffee maker gets.  An on/off switch, and that's about it.  I like that you don't need a special cup/mug for it, and can use any standard-sized 12 oz. coffee mug for it to brew into. I don't think it will fit a larger size.  It's very compact on my desk, and brews a cup pretty fast.
But I guess with price and size, you lose some quality.  The filter is a very fine mesh, and not as "open" as many other filters.  With the short brew time, the resulting brew is weaker than is desirable.  If you like a stronger coffee, I suggested a finer ground of beans than you would normally use for a drip machine.  Paper filters may also help some.  
Overall, a product for convenience, not quality, but with some brew-engineering, it may be able to turn out some decent coffee.

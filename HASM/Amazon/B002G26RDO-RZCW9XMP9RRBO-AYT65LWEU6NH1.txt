Title: Laptop Wonderland
Content:
What a great Toshiba laptop for the price. It's fast, clear picture and it's easy to use. I love the way the touch pad for the mouse is, it works great. And the screen size, it's great for watching DVD movies on vacation! Didn't want to buy a DVD player that was small and convenient just to take on vacation, so after purchasing this laptop, I took it on vacation and the picture was fantastic 18 inch screen and the sound was the greatest ever. I even used the headphones and was totally surprised at how fantastic this sounded. Only bad thing is I'd rather have been able to get this in Purple.

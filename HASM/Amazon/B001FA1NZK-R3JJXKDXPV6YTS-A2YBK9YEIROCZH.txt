Title: pc and document transfer
Content:
Ipod Touch
Unable to acess hard disk,this was possible previously, cannot transfer documents from pc to ipod. I expected to be able to do this easily, not possible. I would have like this feature for work. 
I can download medical textbooks to this application, which are very nice. But overall I am very disappointed and wish that I had not I spent so much money on this and downloads I now cannot return. The media is excellent, but I wish I could have bought something like a new palm tx with a replaceable battery. It suited my needs much better. Text clearer on downloads.Apple iPod touch 16 GB (2nd Generation) LATEST MODEL

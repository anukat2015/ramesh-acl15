Title: 3 years later, the grind and brew is still great
Content:
I've had the grind and brew for almost 3 years, and have never had any problems. It makes great coffee, it's not that hard to clean, and it has adjustable settings for temperature and coffee strength, so if you fiddle with it a little, you can get it to make exactly the coffee you want.
I gave one to my cousin a couple of years ago as well, and it turned him into a total coffee addict.

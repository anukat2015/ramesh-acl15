Content:
Twenty years ago I had a Bunn at home and at work.  I loved them.  Because of the cost, when mine went out, I bought a cheaper brand with automatic shut off.  Now that I have gone back to Bunn:
1. I miss being able to stick my cup under the spout, giving it a little push for my coffee without having to lift a breakable glass pot. 
2. I miss the auto shut off.  
3. It takes as long to run pre-heated water through the Bunn as it did for the my old maker to heat and run water through.  
4. I miss being able to steal a cup of coffee while it's making.  
5. It is a really good coffee maker but there is another brand I personally like better for half the cost.  
6.  A Bunn does last longer, makes good coffee, and you have a coffee pot to carry to the table to serve your guest.

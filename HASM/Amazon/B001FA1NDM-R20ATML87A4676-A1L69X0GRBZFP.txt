Title: iPod Nano the way to go.
Content:
I got my iPod nano for Christmas.  I love it the 16 GB makes a huge difference. My previous nano was only 8Gb and I couldn't fit my entire music collection on it.  Now with 16 G I have all my music and some video podcasts.  The buttons work well and I love the tilt feature that autmatically tilts video's to the side so you can watch them on a bigger screen.  Another cool feature is the shake shuffle.  Don't like the song just give it a shake and it shuffles for you.  Handy, but watch out on the train you might smack somebody.  All in all Apple did a great job with the style on the feartures of this compact player.

Title: Nothing I would change, nice machine.
Content:
This is our second HP laptop after a series of HP desktops and current HP printers.  Cannot say anything bad about them.  I mean I bought the machine knowing its capacities and was not disapointed. Quality of build is good, we've had the CQ 50 139NR for over a year now, it is solid and doesn't come apart with steady use. Outside of more battery life, always want more, we have seen good products from HP. After 8 years we finally just scrapped an HP printer that wouldn't quit. On our Compaq Desktop (made by HP) I thought I needed service, (my bad) and they answered the phone quickly, and were able to remotely access my machine and then took care of everything, I just chatted with the guy over the phone as he cleaned up the mess I made with the software.  Then the next day, HP service calls me just to ask if everything is working fine on my machine.  A++ service too! I like HP, as long as they keep making good stuff and you can get their products at affordable prices!

Title: ELECTRIC HEATER WITH REMOTE
Content:
PACKED WELL AND SAFELY. WELL BUILT WITH OSCULATING FEATURE AND OTHER CONVENIENT OPTIONS. HOWEVER, THERMOMETER SETTING IS NOT WORKING FOR ME. I'VE READ AND REREAD THE INSTRUCTIONS [3 LANGUAGES]..I'D STILL RECOMMEND THIS HEATER. THE REMOTE WORKS FINE. BUT, I CAN'T USE THE THERMOSTAT VERY WELL. I JUST TURN IT ON AND OFF WHEN NEEDED..

Title: Lousy!
Content:
I have to weigh in with the other customers who find this machine hard to use, hard to clean, brews no better than a $9.00 white plastic number from Family Dollar, gunks up with grounds in the grinder, leaves grounds in your cup, never dries out on it's own and the grinder part steams up even when you don't use the grinder so you have to clean it all the time even when you don't use it anymore 'cause you're sick of it, has a carafe that pours in a little trickle and won't empty. So sorry I bought this. I thought I was buying a top-of-the-line machine for my coffee-lovin' husband, but he hates this machine more than I do. Don't buy it. It's overpriced junk.

Title: Does What I Need
Content:
I've had the Iriver H10-20GB for over a year and a half and it continues to be a solid, reliable player. I use a software program called Media Monkey to manage my music library and it syncs with no problem.
I have to admit I don't ask alot from my player - just store and play music.
I especially like the long battery life. I recommend this product.

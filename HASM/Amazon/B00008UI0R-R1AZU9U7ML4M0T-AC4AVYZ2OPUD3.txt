Title: this vacuum is a freak
Content:
Ok short and simple. Buy this vacuum. My husband and I seriously bought and returned 4 other vacuums before we decided to get this one. Let me just say this, we have a long haired Saint Bernard, AND a mix breed with long hair.  Both shed like it is their job, and they are mostly inside dogs, with that said, it is clear that we obviously needed a vacuum that could perform.  This vacuum is off the hook. It's sturdy, powerful, rugged, versatile, and VERY pretty. it has very cool lights and buttons.  It is full of power, and gets the job done the first time.  But people expect that BECAUSE it is a bagless you will epmty the thing more than a bagged vacuum of course.  But it's so easy to empty, it's no sweat.  I LOVE the long reach capabilities, and the versatility of power.  I needed lots of power for the dog hair in certain rooms of the house. OH, and we have HARDWOOD and carpet, works like a champ on our hardwood, as well.  Just get it. and then write your own review on how this vacuum has you trippin. ha!

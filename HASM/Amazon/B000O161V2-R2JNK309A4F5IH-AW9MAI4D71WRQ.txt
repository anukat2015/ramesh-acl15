Title: Better than expected
Content:
For thirty years we've always had a good SLR camera.  By comparison, the D40X is absolutely too good and easy to be true.  The automatic mode is virtually flawless.  The in-camera editing is easier to use than computer photo programs. The 18-135 telephoto lens is just right for most shots. Professional photos are now possible for any user!

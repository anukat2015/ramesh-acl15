Title: Effective, Efficient
Content:
I was worried that this unit would not get the job done.  Well...just like the Bible says, that time spent worrying was wasted time!  We put this little joker in our cabin on the river to help heat it this winter while we were replacing our entire main HVAC system.  The cabin has a large great room with ceilings 18-22' high and the bedrooms are off the great room about a third of the way up.  Total sq ft is probably 1600' or so.  This heater took care of the WHOLE PLACE!!  I ran the unit and the ceiling fans in the great room and within about 10-15 minutes or so the entire cabin started getting down right comfortable.  When the HVAC system is up and running (heat pump) I'm thrilled to know that the bulk of the initial heating can and will be done with this little gas-sipping heater.  It's a great buy and will wind up saving tons of cash on the electric bill.  Highly recommend!

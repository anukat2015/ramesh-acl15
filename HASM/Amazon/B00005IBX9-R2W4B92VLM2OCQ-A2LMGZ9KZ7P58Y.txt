Title: Blech!
Content:
I bought this coffee maker about 6 months ago. I only drink iced coffee so I make 3-5 potsful a week. I have tried 4 different coffees from my local shop (where they grind them for me) including one that I adored for years. And it doesn't matter what I do, this coffee maker creates the most bitter coffee imaginable. I'm drinking some right now with 5 packets of Splenda to make it tolerable (I usually use 2 packets of sweetener.)
It is so bad that I've taken apart everything I can to make sure that I didn't accidentally leave some packing materials in there. I would suspect that my taste buds are changing somehow but the iced coffee I buy at work tastes exactly the same (and just as good) as it ever did.
And, for those who complain about how difficult it is to add the water -- if you are right-handed, you have it easy. I'm a lefty and my right hand is strong enough to pick up a pot with 9-12 cups of water in it, but it's not coordinated enough to pour it. So I have 2 options. I can pour it from the left, along the water purifier (verrrrry slowly) or I can pull the entire machine out to the extent its cord allows, turn it around 180 degrees and pour it in the other slot. When I'm done, I can stand on tiptoe to look inside for the water level. (And I'm 5'6" tall. Shorter people must need a stepladder to look in.)
All this because I wanted a coffee maker with auto shut-off.

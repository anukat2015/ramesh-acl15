Title: Problem with Euro=Pro EP703
Content:
The euro-pro has great suction and ease of use IF THE HOSE WOULD STAY TOGETHER. The sections do not fit snugly enough and you end up with them falling off during vacuuming.  My only complaint is the hose coupling, but it is bothersome enough that I would not buy another euro-pro.

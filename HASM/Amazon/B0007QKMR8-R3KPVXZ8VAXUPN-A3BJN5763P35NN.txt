Title: Great Camera for Beginners (and I Assume Pros)
Content:
I love this camera!  I don't know a whole lot about professional photography, but I love to play and have gotten some great shots over the years with my Canon Sureshot.  This is my first SLR, and for the first time, I feel like the quality is comparable to film.  I've had this camera a week, and have already figured out how to take great pics.  You can do as much or as little creatively as you want to with this camera.  The kit lens has been fine for what I use it for (mostly family/baby shots), but the zoom is a little lacking if you're wanting to use it from a distance (such as a sporting event).  It's great if you have young children in the house who don't hold their cute expressions very long.  I took 200 photos in no time, not realizing how many I had and still had plenty of room on the 2GB card.  I've had to recharge the battery twice - using the viewfinder eats the battery up, so I'm weighing the pros and price of a spare, but it only takes an hour or 2 to recharge.  (I did find the battery dead after not using the camera for a couple of days, when previously it had partial charge).  There is a digital battery indicator on the screen, however, it only has two settings - fully charged and "half" charged, which can mean "about to die," so if you do imporant shoots on a timetable, I'd have a fully charged spare.  It does take a little longer to load onto the computer compared to my Kodak Easyshare, but it's really not bad - not as bad as I was expecting after reading other reviews.  We ordered the 8 megapixel and have been very satisfied.

Title: Amazing Machine
Content:
This laptop is amazing in every way. Maybe because I am coming from PC's. But I will never go back. It performs tasks with ease. I am not sure why people are complaining about the glossy screen. It looks great. I had a Dell, and that was a bad glossy screen. If the screen is a problem then buy a screen cover that go on like screen protectors that get rid of any glare.

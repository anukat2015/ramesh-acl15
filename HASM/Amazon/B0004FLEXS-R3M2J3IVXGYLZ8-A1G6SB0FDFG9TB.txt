Title: Great Coffee Maker!
Content:
We previously had another Black and Decker, and loved it.  Unfortunately the seal wore out, and water began seeping on the counter.
After a good deal of research of other makers on the market in a reasonable price range - I settled on the Michael Graves, based largely on the "flavor boost" button.  The coffee it made was WEAK!  The flavor boost just barely made it normal.  That one went back to the store.
I decided to try my luck with another Black and Decker and love it!  No seal problems on this one.  Timed/Programmed coffee, sneak a cup, easy fill water, and easy remove/clean coffee filter basket.  This one is a great deal, will make a great cup of coffee and is not a lot of fuss!

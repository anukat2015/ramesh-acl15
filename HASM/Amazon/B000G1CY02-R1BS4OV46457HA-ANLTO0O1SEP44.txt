Title: Great
Content:
We live in an old 850 sq.ft. apartment that falls short in the insulation dept. Running the baseboard heaters was like filling your gas tank this last summer. We bought this heater a couple months ago and mounted it to the wall and sometimes run a small fan infront of it to help circulate the heat around the place. Lastniht it dropped below 20* Although this heater is designed to heat about 200 sq.ft. it kept the main living space (about 500 sq.ft.) comfortable until bedtime, when we turn it down.

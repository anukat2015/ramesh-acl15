Content:
I just recieved my XTi today, i sold my Olympus E300 to switch to this camera due to already having an XT and the whole Lens situation. At First look the camera is basically the same as the XT, with the few notable exceptions, the larger lcd is a plus, all the other controls are pretty much the same. I've taken a few test shots also and really believe the quaity is a bit better. (I still love my XT though), Canon has really lived up to its reputation this time. As for why the switch (yes i used to be a die hard Olympus fan) Lenses, Running my own Portriat Studio requires several lenses, most of which are not cheap, but having choices with my canon cameras helps me control the costs. with the olympus digital slr's your pretty much tied to their lenses. This is just my initial review, heading back to more shooting.. will update this as things develop.. for now i can say "BRAVO" Canon...You've done well

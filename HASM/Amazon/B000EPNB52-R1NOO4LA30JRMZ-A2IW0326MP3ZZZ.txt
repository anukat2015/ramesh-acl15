Title: Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
Content:
This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player:
- Incredibly small, thin, and very light.
- Well designed, fit on your palm, pocket, or pencil case.
- High resolution colour screen, shows albumart, photos, and games in colors.
- Superb sound.
- Click wheel; easy navigation as the original iPod.
- New features:
  > World Clock
  > Stopwatch
  > Screen Lock
- now with iTunes 5, it's easy to sync AddressBook, Calendar, etc between Ms Outlook and iPod nano.
- with flash memory, the nano is 100% skip free; a true sport companion.
- headphone jack at the bottom, making it easier to read the screen (without rotating it first) when we take the nano out from our jeans pocket.
Although it comes with lots of advantages, yet:
- 4 GB is the maximum capacity possible.
- USB connection only.
- No charger adapter, you should use the USB connection to recharge the battery. It means the computer or laptop should be around you. Make sure you bring your laptop on your vacation.
- Only two colors available, black or white. No more pink, blue, green, etc.
Accessories that you may like:
- The lanyard. With this earphone, you can wear your iPod nano as necklace. No more tangle and you can change the music right away without reaching your pocket.
- The silicon case. This silicon case comes in colors and will change the look of your iPod nano. It will also protect your iPod from scratches and prevents it from sliding on a tilted table or slipped out of your pocket when you're sitting.
Overall this is a really great product! Before deciding to buy this MP3 player, make sure you have USB 2.0 on you computer or laptop. Some people had bought this nano and having USB 1 connection on their PC, making the song transfer a painful and time consuming process. It will takes hours to fill up your iPod nano with USB 1. Therefore, the existance of USB 2.0 on your PC is crucial. Also, if you are frequent traveller, it is a good idea to buy another accessory for recharging the battery og your iPod without connecting it to PC. Otherwise, you will have to bring your laptop with you or look for PCs on your vacation to recharge your nano.

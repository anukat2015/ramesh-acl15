Title: versitile, but a bit slow
Content:
I'm in the navy, so a smaller laptop that swivels around to make a tablet while laying down in your bunk comes in handy.  
I like the stylus pen which comes in handy for small links or buttons that your finger is too big to pinpoint on the screen.  All the features of this touchscreen laptop are nice, but its performance is hampered due to all these features.
I'm sure with a faster processor, all would be solved, but this one is a bit slow.  Start up time is slower, even out of the box.
No other gripes except the speed.  I almost bought a mini-laptop, but i liked the internal DVD and the touchs/swivel monitor.  I told myself I would get a IBOOK next, i guess I'll be waiting again for MAC to come out with their own touchscreen computer.
PS  The HP touchsmart PC's are nicer and faster, I owned one as well.

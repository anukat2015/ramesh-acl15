Title: A Great Alternative
Content:
This item is a great alternative to messy fireplace candles in a faux insert.  I measured my fireplace insert and decided to go with this little stove-type instead of just the plain electric logs.  This fit in beautifully and adds such ambience to the fireplace and room.  I highly recommend it.  The low and high heat feature is a bonus, especially if your furnace is on the fritz !!!!

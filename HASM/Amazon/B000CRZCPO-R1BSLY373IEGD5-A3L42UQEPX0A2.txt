Title: Don't even think twice about buying this Camera!
Content:
I purchased the Nikon D200 w/Nikkor 18-200mm lens kit 2 weeks ago and couldn't be happier and probably haven't slept a whole week since getting it ;) This is my first DSLR, but not my first digital camera. The camera and lens are simply amazing!  The learning curve is somewhat big on this camera, but with the Blue Crane DVD, Nikons owners manual and Nikon's online video tutor, I already understand most of the functions well enough to take awesome shots. In a pinch you can point and shoot, but the real power of the D200 is in the "easy to understand" menu system for customization. There are literally thousands, if not millions of, options/combinations at your finger tips. You can save 4 different custom settings, and or reset the menus to default anytime. 
The camera is solidly built, and fits well in my large hands with all of the basic controls at my fingertips (IE...White balance, ISO, Image Quality, Focus Mode, Exposure compensation, Metering, Depth of field preview button...etc.) I also purchased the Nikon MB-D200 Multi-Power Battery Pack and an extra Nikon EN-EL3e Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery. I love the feel of the camera with the grip. The camera does suck the juice, especially if you use the LCD to review and use the menu system a lot. That may be the only negative but is a small price to pay for all the features you get inside this beauty! I don't see it ever being a problem with the double battery power pack though. And if you are in a bind, the power pack also takes AA batteries. Another plus!
The auto focus is incredible too. It takes a little practice to get use too, but WOW, does it ever work! My advice, if you have the extra money, is to buy this camera with the 18-200mm Nikkor lens. It is so versatile, I don't even know if I'll need another lens in my bag.  If you are thinking about purchasing this camera, just buy it...you won't be dissapointed at all! I was debating between the D80 & D200, and am so glad I spent the extra money on the D200! In the long run, the added features of the D200 over the D80 are well worth it for me. Bottom line: The Nikon D200 rocks! 5 HUGE STARS! 
NOTE: Don't forget to add a compact flash memory card with your purchase. The camera does not come with a card.... I bought the SanDisk SDCFX3-2048-901 2 GB Extreme III CompactFlash Card and love it. Super fast card!

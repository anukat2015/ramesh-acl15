Title: Wonderful Camera for the Entry Level Photographer
Content:
I purchased this camera because I needed a new camera and wanted to have the flexibility and versatility of a DSLR. I am by no means an experienced photographer but this camera is great for what I need and want. I have taken great shots of people, pets, and nature and the camera has performed flawlessly. Of course, it isn't as "easy" as a point and shoot camera so be sure to at least read a few professional photographers tips and whatnot online before considering a DSLR. What most will tell you is that "electronics don't make the photos" so an expensive camera doesn't necessarily automatically produce great pictures.
Anyway, I am very pleased with this camera and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to venture into the world of DSLR photography.

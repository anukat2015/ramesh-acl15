Title: Good product for the money.
Content:
This player is very flexible. 
First, you don't need to install the software it comes with to load music into it. 
My Lenovo Y710 with Vista sees this player as a flash drive. The directory Music is what I am interested in. I can just drag and drop music into it. Real simple, since I manage my music with windows media player. I don't like to use ITunes or whatever software is out there. 
The sound quality is good, I am not very educated on this so I am just saying that I like the sound. 
I really like that it has the SD card extension. I can upgrade the storage capacity with little money. 
The user interface of the tool is fairly simple. I didn't have to spend a lot of time learning it. I also am only interested in playing mp3's. I haven't experimented with the video playing features. That is the reason I am not giving 5 stars.

Title: great camera for the price
Content:
I have bought this camera after seeing many reviews and comments on this camera. I am not a professional but I felt it is very easy to use. I am able to take few good picture out of the box. The cannon and Nikon have better options than this but for the price range the sony 200w offers far better options compared to the cannon and nikon. the only option that is missing on this camera is live view mode that is not at all a problem for me, on my previous camera DSC-H7 i always preferred  to use view finder rather than live view. Auto focus works great. instead of spending 399 on mega zoom camera invest 150 more on this slr.
pros:
easy to use.
offers a lot for the price.
in body image stabilizer.
image stabilizer works well with short range but can be noticeable on 200mm zoom
software works on mac too, but i can find all the options than are in software in i-life or i-photo on mac.
good battery life (I forgot to turn off the camera for two days and the battery life stood at the same level where i left two days before )
cons:
no live view
lens are pricey when compared to lens for nikon and cannon

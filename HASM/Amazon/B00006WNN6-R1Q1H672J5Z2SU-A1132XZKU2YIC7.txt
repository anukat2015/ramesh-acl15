Title: Some help but disappointing
Content:
I ordered several of these heaters, so I was comparing several features.  The first concern I had was for safety.  This has an automatic shut-off feature if it is tipped over.  Price was a consideration, as we were ordering 4 units, and the price was quite reasonable.  We find the heaters do work (to heat the bathroom before taking a shower,) but the unit turns off before reaching the desired temperature.  Though the unit does have fan speed and thermostat controls, there is no way to adjust it so that the unit will come back on again.  I would rather have a heater which lets me decide how warm I would like the bathroom to be!  But it does do a reasonable job, raises the temp just enough to take the chill off.

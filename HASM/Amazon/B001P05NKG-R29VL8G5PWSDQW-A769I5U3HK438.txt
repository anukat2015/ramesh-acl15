Title: I wouldn't choose anything else
Content:
This is my 3rd Mac laptop. Every one I've been able to use for many years with daily long term use. I read all the negative reviews and found most of them to be totally unfair as it seems like the buyers simply didn't pay attention to what they were buying, made assumptions, then complained it didn't live up to their expectations. It's ok not to think highly of them, but don't blame them because you didn't look closer at what you purchased. I'm not sure I'd rely strictly on the Amazon description and would look at them on [...] as well just so you know what it is before you buy, but it was definitely cheaper to buy here. 
These are very sturdy laptops, look sleek and travel well. I love the backlit keys as I like to use it a lot late at night without the lights on. The aluminum unibody frame is is very chic. and it's a bit smaller in depth than the previous models. The new trackpad is excellent and built in function key features are fantastic. I wouldn't buy anything else.

Title: An excellent compromise
Content:
Sometimes it's a chore dragging along the Canon 5D Mark 2 with attached 24-70mm L lens.
I've been waiting for a "grab-and-go" small camera with DSLR-like image quality for a long time.
Panasonic has come to the rescue with the GF1.  What a FUN camera!
   PRO: Lightweight- no deadweight on your shoulder or around your neck, beautiful image quality from a small camera ( I shoot exclusively in RAW ), fast auto focus, great "pancake" f/1.7 fast lens companion (don't let the lack of OIS chase you away from this setup; my 24-70mm walking-around lens on the 
5D2 doesn't have OIS and that's seldom a problem), noise isn't a consideration up to ISO 800 (if you'll consistently shoot high ISO than get NIK's Dfine 2.0 noise reduction software). Battery lasts a LONG time.
Between me and my wife, we have owned many small/point and shoot cameras (Canon SD1100, Canon G6,G9,G10,A650IS) and NONE were as enjoyable as the GF1 is.
   CON: Optional EVF dull in comparison to the LCD screen or if you're spoiled by bright DSLR viewfinders,
Mono sound recording, LCD screen easily smudged since it's so big.
Really Right Stuff makes an L-plate for the GF1. Team that with a light monopod with quick release, and you have a VERY light weight combination to take along without dragging you down.
In the past, it was usually a disappointment for me to take a "small" camera along since image quality was always a compromise, so I stopped doing so.  This GF1 may not be as great as my 5D2 DSLR, but I'm not disappointed with my images from my "small" camera any more. Don't miss this gem.

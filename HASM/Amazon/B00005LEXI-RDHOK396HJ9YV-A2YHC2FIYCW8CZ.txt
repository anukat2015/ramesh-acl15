Title: Very Good Emergency Heater
Content:
This is a very good emergency heater with very good features.  It runs extremely well on high and "medium".  I would have rated the unit "5 stars" except that it has a slight sputter on the low setting.  I discussed this with the factory and they said this was a common occurence on the low setting.  They also confirmed that the unit worked smoothest and best on medium and high.  I should note that the unit only has low and high notched settings, but you can get medium by setting the selector dial between the 2 notches.  It would be better if the factory had just designed the unit to work at notched settings of 6,000 BTU (medium) and 9,000 BTU (high) as their actual product design.

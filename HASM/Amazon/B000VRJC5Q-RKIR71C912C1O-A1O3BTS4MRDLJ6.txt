Title: Felt Like Second Nature
Content:
I purchased this camera as an upgrade to my sony A100, because I was building my photography business, and WOW was I impressed. I hit limits with the A100 and was looking for a great upgrade. I spent days, DAYS looking around, reading, researching cameras in the sony lineup and this one hit everything on the mark (I had a collection of old minolta lens and sony lens already). It's definitely something I can grow with for the next two years. 
Pros:
+ being a sony user - it felt so intuitive, I knew what I was doing after 5 minutes of use
+ ISO handling is awesome
+ the 16-105 Sony lens is amazing for the price
+ its size is impressive and the body is built wonderfully with the magnesium alloy body
+ comes with a wireless remote
+ the 3" LCD screen spoiled me rotten :)
+ the AF/MF back button - I can quickly go between the two - it's simple awesome
Cons:
+ the joystick is annoying for quick navigation through photos but you can scroll thru it all (also its the "enter" button pretty annoying there too)
+ weight - its pretty heavy around your neck, you might want to get the hand grip
+ the eye start focus was annoying now its really helpful once you get use to it. (you can turn this off)
+ the RAW files are Bigger than I'm use too (18mb&lt;), be sure to have enough RAM to handle your editing software (I use CS3)
Overall I am SUPER happy I got this camera. It has been my happy companion and I take it everywhere.

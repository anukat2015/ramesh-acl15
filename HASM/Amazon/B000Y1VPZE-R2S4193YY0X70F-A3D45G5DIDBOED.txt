Title: Won't stay on?
Content:
Ours worked for about 4 months and then started turning itself off after brewing only 1 or 2 cups. We now stand by the coffee maker and keep pushing the on button and eventually we get a pot of coffee. The thermal Carafe is also poorly designed and requires that you insert a small plastic lid after brewing, otherwise the coffee gets very lukewarm after only an hour or two.
I'm on Amazon today looking to buy a new Thermal Coffee maker and it won't be a Zojirushi!

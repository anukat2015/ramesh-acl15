Title: Very fast!  Great Value!
Content:
Great laptop and very fast.  A really good value for a core 2 duo.  I like that ASUS has changed the exterior to a brushed aluminum finish for this laptop.  I have another ASUS laptop that has the piano black finish on the exterior and it is hard to keep looking nice.
The touch pad works fine for me -- I think I had read some previous reviews when I purchased that some people had problems; I haven't had any.  The left-click is a little stiff and hard to click, but I think it is just my laptop, and I'll probably send it in for repair over spring break when I have time to go without the laptop for a few days.  Also, the right front edge of the laptop "creaks" when I rest my hand on it to type; something to do with the case where the bottom portion meets the top portion.  Again, this is likely a quality issue with my specific laptop that I will have taken care of when sent in for repair.
Overall, a VERY good laptop, especially for sub-$700 for a core 2 duo.  Very light, easy to carry.  Awesome battery life.  Haven't formally kept track of how long the battery lasts from start to finish, but I'd say 8+ hours easy.  Amazing for a laptop when I consider that my Sony Vaio that this replaced lasted 1 1/2 hours tops.
If you're considering this laptop, I'd say DO IT!  Don't let the little problems I've had with mine deter you (left-click and creaky case) as they are likely just a quality issue with my specific laptop.  I have another ASUS laptop (about six months older) and it has no problems and works just fine too.

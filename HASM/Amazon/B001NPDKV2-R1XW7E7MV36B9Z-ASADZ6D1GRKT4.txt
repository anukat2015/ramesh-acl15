Title: Very Good machine...with just a different key board layout...
Content:
I bought this one, with a 4GB RAM, from Staples, during their President's Day 2009 Sale.
The machine is very capable, comes with AMD Athelon X2 (Core 2 Duo type) processor, a whopping 4 GB RAM, NVidia Graphics card etc. It also comes with a 64 bit Windows Vista HOME PREMIUM. So thats much better than the Vista Home Basic.
The only thing different with this machine is its key board layout. Since it has a saperate number key-pad, the keys for Pageup, Page Down, Arrow Keys, Insert, Delete etc are either small or on some other location. That takes some time to get used to.
* Large 15.6" screen is very sharp 
* Keyboard includes a numeric keypad 
* Good sized Hard Drive 
* DL DVD RW 
* Fast Processor  
* Lots of RAM (4GB) 
* 3 USB ports 
* Built in Wi-Fi support 
* Built in Eathernet 
* Built in Modem (in case you still live in old days :-) 
* Built in 5-1 Memory Card reader 
It has a 15.6 inch screen and comes with direct DVD playback. So its easy to watch movies on this laptop. 
Overall, this machine is a wonderful machine for home and small business purposes.
Hope this helps!

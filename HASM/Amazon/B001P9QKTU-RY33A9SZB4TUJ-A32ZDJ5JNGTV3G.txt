Title: Gateway MD 7820U Laptop
Content:
I recently purchased a Gateway MD7820U laptop online.  The computer came in two days.  The computer is very fast online and boots quickly.  Vista has a number of security features not found on Windows.  However, the computer has a number of problems.  Because it is a 64-bit computer, I can't get certain software for it yet, such as VPN.  It is difficult to understand how to back up files on my jump drive, as it wants to back up on DVDs.  Most importantly, the computer has a faulty keyboard that types in "c"s or "d"s or "b"s when I move the arrow keys.  It has ruined several spreadsheets, email messages, and Word documents.  I emailed Gateway and their customer service is disgraceful.  Even though the computer is brand new, I was told I had to pay them to get advice on the problem.  Nice people, eh?  Gateway really stands behind their products!  Not!  I think the Gateway executives should get a two-week paid vacation to a water theme park--Gitmo.

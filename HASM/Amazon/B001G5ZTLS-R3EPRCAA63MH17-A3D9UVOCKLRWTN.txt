Title: Disenchanted
Content:
I just received my 5D Mk2 less than two weeks ago. I have ran it through probably 2000 actuations and just today noticed a very obvious dead pixel. I have not exposed it to any harsh conditions, although I was hoping to be able to. I am sending it back for an exchange but I am very disappointed. I will re-review when I receive the replacement. I've been putting this off and finally jumped to get this camera and just don't know how to feel. I feel at bit cheated at this point, but we'll see.

Title: Very pleased, a few minor flaws
Content:
I love this coffee maker because it makes a great tasting cup of coffee, and it looks fantastic in my stainless kitchen.  I'm sure the water filter is the main reason for the great taste.  It doesn't make coffee super fast, but letting the water heat properly and linger on the grounds also makes for great taste.  It doesn't take too long, just longer than my last cheap machine.
Two things I dislike:
I would rather have an insulated stainless carafe.
There is quite a bit of condensation on the inside of the lid after the brewing cycle, so I leave the lid open to air it out for a while every time I brew so I don't get mold.
Over all, I'm just so happy I can make a nice cup of coffee finally!

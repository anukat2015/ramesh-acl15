Title: Great easy to use camera
Content:
A great camera, easy to use - the Auto settings are awesome and the IS lenses make it easy to get a great shot.
Perfect as a backup camera for the Pros and a great starter camera for someone upgrading from a point and shoot digital. The SD memory is cheap and easy to use. 
I've had mine for close to a year and love everything about it!

Title: Excellent Laptop. One of the best I've used. I love it every bit.
Content:
I got this laptop as a replacement for my Insprion Laptop. I love this laptop every bit especially after using Inspiron 1525. I love the LCD Screen, battery life and the configuration of this sytem. Windows 7 is really good and it makes me like my laptop even more. This one has the t6600 intel core2duo's centrino processor. Studio laptops stands out in its looks and is comparable to the Hp's. One the bad side, this laptop is a bit heavy.

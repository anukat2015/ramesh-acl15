Title: A bit let down...
Content:
The unit arrived on time and in full working order.  It is rather bulky, and must be near a window for the purpose of ventilation, something which was not made real clear in the advertising.  That limits its "portability" from my perspective.  I could have bought a window unit for about half the price if I had known that beforehand.  The unit is also a bit louder than a window unit, and makes sleeping rather difficult when it is on.  While rated at 12,000 BTU, it seems to cool as if it were a 5,000 BTU unit.

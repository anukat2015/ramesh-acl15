Title: Bought my second one!
Content:
I replaced an aging Cuisinart with the exact same model.  It took me a while to find it at a decent price, but Amazon came through with a sale and a $30 rebate.  
I read other peoples reviews and had to shake my head in disbelief.  We used our first one for over 5 years, and loved every minute of it.  The feature that we liked the most is the thermal coffee carafe.  If you've ever had coffee that has sat on a heating element for a couple hours and tasted like burnt coffee, then you would appreciate this model.  
People complained about the clean up of the parts after making coffee.  So, you have to empty the strainer of old coffee, like always, clean out the carafe, like always, and the only added thing is if you grind the beans, you have to rinse out the grinder. I would think anyone who grinds their own coffee would appreciate the small step(s) it take to have great tasting coffee.  Yes the grinder makes noise, but doesn't most grinders? We're Dunkin Donuts crazies, and buy the beans and the ground coffee from them for $20/4 bags, and love that we can awaken every morning with fresh hot Dunkin Donuts coffee.  We also have staggered mornings with one person heading out @ 4:30 am and then 6:00 am and 7:00 am.  The coffee is hot for everyone, and still tastes fresh.  We prepare the coffee to go at dinner time so the few extra steps of cleaning it really adds nadda to the dinner dishes, no biggie.  It just depends on how much you're willing to do for your coffee!!

Title: Holmes Ceramic Heater works great so far
Content:
The heater has been working great so far, no problems, that I have seen, looks good. The biggest somplaint I would have is that even though it is digital as advertised the steps are too big between the settings. 5 degrees is kind of steep between 70 and 75. 75 can be too high and sometimes 70 can be too low.  If it is on 75 might as well just have it set to continuous, on 70 it can leave you wishing it would come on because the room is cold. At least one more step at 72 would have been useful. Other than that, the output is great even when set on low, have not really even needed the high setting so far.

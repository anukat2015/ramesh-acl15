Title: Broken
Content:
Ordered one of these.  The unit didn't even turn on.  We called Cuisinart and exchanged it (and are out the cost of shipping the broken one back).  The new one sent turns on-but doesn't boil water.  We are about to call them again.   Forty dollars for a broken product.  Fantastic.
Not impressed.

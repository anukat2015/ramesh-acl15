Title: strong suction!
Content:
I really like this vacuum...some complained of a too small bag but I had used it quite a bit before it told me to change the bag...and then the bag was PACKED full. Sometimes with the big wheels, it is not as easy to manipulate in a circle...but you learn how IT wants to go! Love the light weight and the ability to get it out of the way. Would I buy it again...yes!

Title: We love this
Content:
I bought this for our second floor, which gets no heat.  My 2 daughters room is freezing and the space heaters had to run all night to keep them warm.  We bought his and it keeps the room very comfortable.  Not as warm as a space heater would get, but the room is 12x17, larger than recommended.  Our electric bill has been much lower.  The first one we got was broken, so keep your receipt and packaging.  They exchanged it right away and we had a new one.  We are very happy with it and are planning on buying 2 more for the basement and the other upstairs bedroom.  It takes up no room, does not get too hot, and does the job.  Little children may not realize to take their hand off of it.  My 19 month old knows not to touch it because it is hot. I can assume if a baby left their hadn on it that it could get burned, but it would take a while.  Overall a great product.

Title: Hoover, schmoover
Content:
This thing started falling apart the second I put it together. The hose fitting doesn't stay in the tube; I had to drill a hole and put a screw in, which gathers hair every time I use it. You think you're going to like having a cord reeler, but you won't so much when it breaks two months in and you have no way to stow the cord. At least the reeler broke instead of having the plug pop off the end of the cord from it slamming into place. The crevice tool is supposed to double as an upholstery brush, and it ends up being worthless for either job. The awkward floor head had a little pedal on it to fix the brush in place or let it float. This actually took several months to break. The wheels fell off one by one, starting with the ones on the head, next the swivels on the body, and last one of the big ones, which went when I pushed the big power button that is strategically positioned to apply maximum force to the wheel beneath it when you push it. I figure they let the new kid design this one. On the positive side, it does suck like a champ, it doesn't weigh much, and it's fairly quiet. I hate it, though. It's ugly, too. They actually used it in one of those commercials where there's a face in inanimate objects.

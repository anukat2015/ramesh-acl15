Title: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS COFFEEMAKER
Content:
I've read the other reviews, and I beg to differ.  Rinsing will not clean the accumulated coffee from the bean reservoir or the chute. You must clean with either a sponge, paper towel, or your finger to scrape the residue.  And, if you use an oily coffee like Starbucks, the buildup is just awful.  It takes literally 5-7 minutes to clean the parts (properly) on this coffeemaker. The machine does produce good coffee.  The upside is I'm drinking less coffee now because you don't dare have a second pot in the morning, unless you're on vacation and not in a hurry. The Capresso Coffee Team is a much better unit at only $50 more.

Title: Great Value
Content:
I've owned this laptop for about 5 months and so far I'm very happy.  Now some of the reviews contained, in my opinion, some silly complaints.  The screen is reflective which is great unless you use the monitor outdoors or in a brightly lit area.  The advantage of a reflective screen is that images are more vibrant and brighter at the expense of glare.  All of Apple's laptops are the same way.  In fact most consumers, as do I, prefer a non-matt finish.  One reviewer complained that the screen doesn't open all the way to 180 degrees. No laptop that I know of does. That person should just attach an external keyboard if he wants to use the laptop with an external monitor.  Finally people have complained that the keys are not legible due to the bronze color finish.  If you're using this laptop in low light conditions and you're not a touch typist then this could be a deal breaker.  Bestbuy carries the 14.1 inch version of this laptop with the same color.  Go visit the store and decide for yourself if this is a problem.  For the money, this laptop is a great deal.

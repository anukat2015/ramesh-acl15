Title: Quality low cost ultra light
Content:
Thin, light, U4100 processor is fine for regular office work and light play.  Solid full size keyboard and touch pad. Nice bright screen with good viewing angles. Look and feel is expensive and refined although brushed aluminum is just painted on.  Low noise, cool running and plenty of battery life on this 4 cell model. Much faster, more usable and more refined than a netbook.  Much lighter and thinner than a traditional computer.  The face recognition adds a cool factor.  Instant wake from sleep when you open the lid.  Mechanical internet switch when lid is closed which is great for planes and security. My setup asked me if I wanted the free trials which I declined so I did not have the junk the other review mentions. The one major shortcoming is the ultra wide screen makes the screen too short for everyday office use.  Windows 7 exasperates the problem with a space consuming "ribbon" across the top.  Macbooks more rectangular wide screen and software is much better in a 13".  I bought directly from Amazon which packaged it poorly in a big box surrounded by bubble packs that just pushed aside and allowed the computer box to bang around loose.  Thankfully the Lenovo packaging was quite good.

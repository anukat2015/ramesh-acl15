Title: Perfection in Heating
Content:
I bought two of these units to take the place of my forced air heating system.  I followed the directions and turned the units on to high until they got hot then backed them down to low settings.  My forced air heat set at 65 degrees never turned on with the outside temperature at 40 degrees.  The temperature inside my house sayed at 72 degrees though the night.  This is a 1100 square foot house in which I used these heaters in the kitchen/living room and the master bed room on the other end of the house.  If you are looking for a energy saving heat source alternative this is the solution.  I think the quality of this model is better then what I saw on the model available in my local stores.  The look of this unit is also much better in quality that you dont feel ashamed to have displayed with mid to high level grade furnishings.  I am one very happy customer!

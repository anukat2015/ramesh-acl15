Title: Fantastic Little Camera!!
Content:
I researched for some time to upgrade from a Canon A570 point and shoot...a nice camera but not up to my skill level at photography. So I came upon the Rebels and the new XS. I am very pleased with the outcomes so far. This is very easy to use, being familiar with Canon products and the autolevels are accurate. 
Fantastic camera, everyone who has looked at my photos want to know what camera.

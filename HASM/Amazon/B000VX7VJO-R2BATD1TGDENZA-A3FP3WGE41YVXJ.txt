Title: Breville one cup coffee brew
Content:
I like the coffee maker with one exception.It does not fill the travel mug  or regular large mug all the way.  To get a large size regular mug full you must select the travel mug.  I have spoken to Breville about this.  Their explanation for the travel mug was there had to be room to put a lid on.  However, the large regular mug only fills about 2/3 as does the travel mug.

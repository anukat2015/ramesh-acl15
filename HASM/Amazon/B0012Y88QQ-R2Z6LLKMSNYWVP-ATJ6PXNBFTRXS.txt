Title: My First DSLR
Content:
This is my first DSLR. I've always liked CANON as a camera supplier, and have ownd several point and shoot.  This camera is amazing.. I bought it through Amazon am happy with shipping etc. Had to wait 3 months, but thats not their fault.  My only concern is now I need a bigger HD on my PC to keep the 12 Mega Pixel photos.
I have been shooting, (over 2000) photos in the 2-3 months since I got this camera.  Its fast, and easy to use. Recommended every time.
Love the long battery life. I have a 8Gb card, holds nearly 1400 photos in JPG format, highest resolution. RAW would be a bit less. Battery takes over 500 photos with flash used on about 30-40% of the shots.
Light and easy to use..

Title: With a heater too!
Content:
I put a review on the one without the heater and now I wanna do one on the one with the heater because my office purchased one of those too. Actually, my co-worker bought the one with the heater because she's always trying to do something better than me. I have to admit, hers is good too. The cooling function is just like the other air conditioner I bought but when its cold in the mornings or on the odd day during the summer, we crank that heat man and it helps! I asked her if hers came from air-n-water too and she said it did. She said she got the receipt and it said the one without the heater so she called air-n-water real quick and they totally went out of their way to make sure the right one was sent to her. And it still came pretty fast. So she outsmarted me this time but I'll figure out a way to make her look bad anyway.

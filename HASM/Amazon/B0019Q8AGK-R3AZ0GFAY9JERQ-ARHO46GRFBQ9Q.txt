Title: Worst vacuum ever purchased
Content:
I've had this vacuum for just over 9 months.  I think the only person that hates it more than me is my housekeeper!  It is clunky and heavy.  The hose is way too long and makes maneuvering difficult.  Constantly crashing into furniture.  Now the retractable cord keeps rewinding on its own.  I'll have to lug this overpriced, overrated machine back to Sears to have a stupid cord fixed.  And like the other reviewer noted, the suction is not the greatest.  I expect more when paying over $500 for a vacuum cleaner.

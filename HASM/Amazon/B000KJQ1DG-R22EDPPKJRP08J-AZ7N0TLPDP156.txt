Title: Awesome Camera
Content:
This is a great little camera, really easy to use and excellent quality. I moved from a SONY DSC-H5 also a good point and shoot camera with great zoom [12x] to a D40. I am super happy with it, the picture quality is awesome and super detail. Being a D-SLR camera you have to be very careful about getting dust on the mirror inside the body and even worse on the Image sensor. Dust on these parts will show up as black spots on your pictures, its not a big problem but they have to be cleaned very carefully with out scratching the parts involved. Other than that it is a camera you can do so so so much with. I highly recommend it. Check out www.kenrockwell.com for how much of a good camera this is. This is my second D40 as I sold my first one to a buddy, the D40 is better than the D60, the D40x and also the D50. Hope this helps you out.

Title: Very good for small places
Content:
5 stars because it corresponds to my needs : canister vacuum, small, light, handy, sucking, with bag - and I have a small studio so it doesn't need big work.
I had the Eureka 431BXZ Optima Lightweight Upright Vacuum Cleaner before (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7YLJK) and I was not satisfied: after a short time it was not sucking anymore and was uniformly spreading dust/hair on my mat without removing them. This vacuum was cheaper, but if it needs to replace the filters often no way .. Also it is a bagless vacuum and it was quite a mess to clean.
This one sucked all the hair and dust out of my mat!! It's a canister vacuum and is very compact - this is good because I have not much storage. At the same time I just find canister vacuum more convenient. This one is so light and small that you can carry it while vacuuming.
Now, it is quite cheap material (making it light) and it is not of high quality - it is perfect for my very small studio (if it keeps working well! - it's been 10 days I have it) but I would definitely not buy it to take care of a big place. For my use, totally satisfied.
Summary:
Convenience: *****
Price: ****
Quality: ***
Suck: ****
For small place: *****
For big place: **

UPDATE March 2009. 
After the enthousiasm of the first days 
(it's been 9 month now I have the vacuum), I have to say that as my previous vacuum (though this one is a little bit better), it kinda spreads uniformly the hair on the carpet, so I have to gather the hair by hand and give them to the vacuum to suck. I feel like I'm mothering and feeding a baby vacuum! 
My small carpet aside, I'm still fully satisfied, the little thing is still working after 9month of use, does the job and is easy to maneuver.
For big places or carpet use, forget it! Otherwise ok. I would remove a star if I could, because of the hair sucking disappointment.

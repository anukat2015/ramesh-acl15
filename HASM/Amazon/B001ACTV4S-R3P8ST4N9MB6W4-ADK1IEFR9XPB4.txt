Title: A good portable unit at a good price
Content:
I was skeptical getting a portable a/c unit after the first one I purchased from a competitor didn't work out of the box.  But I was pleasantly surprised at how well the unit has run and how little it has affected our electric bill.  The only issue I had was that I needed to empty water out of the unit the first two days.  Once I spoke to a CSR, all problems were addressed and all is still well with the unit.  I only use it about 7 hours a day tops, but again I am very pleased to date....

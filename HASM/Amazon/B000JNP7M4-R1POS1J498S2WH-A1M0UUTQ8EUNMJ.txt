Title: Perfect for taking the chill off
Content:
This is the only heat I used all winter.  It's perfect for keeping the chill off.  I live in CA and my apartment is 800 sq ft.  This little heater was enough to keep the living room/dining room/kitchen area (about 400 sq ft) at 70 degrees.  I'm ordering two more because they do the job and are much, much cheaper then using a wall heater.  I have a washer & dryer in my apartment and my electric bill was only $60 per month.  This doesn't blow hot air, it doesn't heat you up fast.  It is steady warmth that does a very good job of taking the chill off.

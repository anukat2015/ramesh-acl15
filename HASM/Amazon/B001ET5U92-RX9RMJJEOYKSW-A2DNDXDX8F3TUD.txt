Title: From D40x to D90
Content:
After having my D40x for a year I was interested in all I heard the D90 could do.  I am very glad I moved up to the D90.  I am an everyday Joe photographer.  I have only had the D90 for a month but feel I made the right choice.  The D90 has many more choices/features when shooting pics: Multiple exposure, bulb, more focus points, live view.  The movie feature works well.  I would not use it to record a wedding but it allows me to get good/fun clips of events that I would never had before unless I carried a camcorder and my camera.  I know i am only using about half of what the D90 has to offer.  The longer I own it, the more I learn what it can do to help me get better pics.

Title: Fast and convenient
Content:
For those of you wondering how to get it 'just right', use the amount of coffee to make a 4 cup serving.  That would be 2 scoops of coffee.  My cup never leaked or overflowed.  I'd suggest reading the directions for those who have had problems, but this little thing is great!

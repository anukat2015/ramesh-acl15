Title: Poor quality, and bad service as well
Content:
I bought this product after reading some reviews here. It could not be turn off after the first time use. Called Panasonic support several times, after answered by operator, I was hung up several times. No return allowed. Every time, instead of listening to my issue, the service people of Panasonic (maybe from India) simply kept reading their policies to me repeatly. 
I had to drive more than 20 miles to a retail service center for repair. The guy there told me I was not the only one had this problem. It turned out, a part was defect. When I came back after left my vacuum with them for a week, the guy fixed the vacuum showed me a part although still shining but broken. 
 
The vacuum is heavy. After this experience, I will not recommend to buy this product. Why should paying full price to buy one it has part defect even it's brand new?

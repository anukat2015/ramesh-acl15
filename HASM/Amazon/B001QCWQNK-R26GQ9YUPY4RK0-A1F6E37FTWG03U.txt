Title: LCD cracked
Content:
This is my 1st and LAST MAC. Only 6 weeks after arriving, the LCD screen cracked. The laptop was kept on my desk. It never even made it outside! The company refused to repair or replace the screen and after less than 2 months I had an expensive repair. The manager at the Genius Bar informed me that the device was dropped (it was not) and the company did not insure the LCD screens.  The laptop is very user friendly, (easier than Visa). But had I known the screens cracked so frequently I would have purchased a Dell. It was a $250 nightmare.

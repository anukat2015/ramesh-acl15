Title: Does the job for me
Content:
My bedroom is the coldest room in the house.  The central oil-fired steam heat is not very efficient in this room while other rooms get quite warm.  Anyway the usual temperature of my bedroom is 61 o F.  I bought this Lasko heater and set it on 65 o F.  I have two quilts and an electric blanket on my bed.  I find that 65 o is perfect temperature for sleeping.  61 was way too cold.  The Lasko brings the temperature up to 65 in an hour or two and I am confortable through the night.  The heater shuts off when it gets to 66 o and then runs again if the temperature drops.  I think it is a great heater and so far it seems to cost me $2 a night.  (My electric bill went up by $60 in the last month I have used the machine.)

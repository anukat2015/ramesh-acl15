Title: Sleek, light-weight, fast
Content:
I work from home, and I use this computer for everything. I wanted to find a computer that I could travel with, and to replace my old Gateway notebook. I was leaning towards Toshiba throughout my online research, but when I saw this in the store, I was intrigued. It is a beautiful design (resembling a Mac), the screen is the perfect size, and it is light-weight. I drive around a lot for my job, and carry this computer around with me comfortably. I was amazed at how fast it starts up, granted I removed some bloat-ware. I recommend removing the pre-installed anti-virus software from any new computer. I also use this computer for basic internet functions (Facebook, e-mails, browsing), but I also watch a lot of movies and TV shows, too. I bought a VGA cable to connect to the plasma TV, and the picture looks great (compared to my boyfriend's older laptop). The video card is just amazing. I think watching a movie through my computer on the TV actually looks better than watching a DVD.  
The only complaint I have about this notebook, which is true for all newer HP notebooks, is the touchpad. It's not easy to scroll webpages sometimes, and the sensitivity varies. Sometimes it is hard to select by tapping, and other times, I accidentally click on something because it is too sensitive. I would recommend getting a wireless mouse, and disabling the touchpad. Overall, I am very impressed with HP's effort. I bought the computer for $600 at Best Buy, which I thought was a pretty good deal. It's super fast, has great picture quality, and serves all of my needs. I definitely recommend this computer.

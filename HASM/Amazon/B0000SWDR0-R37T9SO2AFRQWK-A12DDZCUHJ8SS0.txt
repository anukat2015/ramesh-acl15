Title: Not the greatest vacuum, but ...
Content:
I like its light weight but it uses very small bags, suction is marginal,  and the pieces are cheapie and hard to fit together.  A piece broke at the junction of the motorized head  and the rod which I fixed with electrical tape.  Definitely not prime quality, but I've had others that were not much better.  It seems that vacuum cleaners overall are at the low end of the pole when it comes to quality.  I had a Kenmore that was fine until the electic cord disappeared inside the machine one day & I was unable to extricate it (I am an electrical engineer, thank you).
I would not get this machine again.  Try a Kenmore and put a twist in the cord so it won't slip inside!  BTW if you think you're getting traditional Swedish quality, forget it - this thing is made in Hungary and would not have won any wars against the Russians, you can bet!  (The original Electrolux now go under another name and are priced astronomically).

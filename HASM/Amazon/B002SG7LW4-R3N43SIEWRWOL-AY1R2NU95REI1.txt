Title: Powerful, but powerfully annoying
Content:
This is the most powerful laptop I've had yet, so I'm impressed with its performance. But I didn't buy it because of its power - I bought because it was supposed to last and last. 
Unfortunately this seems like a watered-down version of the true "IBM-durability" we've all heard of, and I have big questions about how much longer it really will last.
Also, what in the hell is this webcam thing? I see it right in front of me, but I swear there is no program or button or anything to turn it on - it's almost just for show. What the @#!$? Lenovo, please. You know better.
A big bone I have to pick with this laptop: every so often a Lenovo advertisement appears out of nowhere in a pop window that slides across the screen. If I'm not paying for it, fine: advertize. But when I pay this much money for a machine, it had better not act like an advertizing machine. 
As a kicker, you get the impossible mousepad, which has about the worst performance you can find (sticky, hard to get it where you want it) and an old-fashioned keyboard which doesn't come close to the Sonys.
You *will* get speed and power. The big question mark is: will you get the durability to justify the Lenovo vs some other brand, and can you live with the annoying kinks of this laptop? If not, pass it over.
I highly, highly, highly recommend you pass this piece of crap over. This laptop was designed not in the engineers' room, but in the advertisers' room.

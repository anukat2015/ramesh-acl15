Title: One healthy sucker!
Content:
I bought this vacuum to replace a 20 year old Hoover Spirit that died only because water was spilled on it. I'm glad I did my research and picked this one! It is terrific. It quieter than the old Spirit and seeems to pick up more dirt. Indeed, the small dirt cup would be annoying in a large home, but it is the pefect size for an apartment. 
The pictures someone posted of the vacuum taped together seem crazy--I think that poor vacuum led a very hard life. The quality and finish of my machine seems like it would take a lot of abuse.

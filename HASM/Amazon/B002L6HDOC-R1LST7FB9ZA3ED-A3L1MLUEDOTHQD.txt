Title: iPod doesn't disappoint!
Content:
iPod style and quality always brings smiles and this Christmas my 2 grandaughters were thrilled when they opened their Nano's. I've owned one myself for almost a year and have had no problems. The ease of connecting to and using itunes makes me never want to own any other brand mp3. I'm a committed iPod fan!

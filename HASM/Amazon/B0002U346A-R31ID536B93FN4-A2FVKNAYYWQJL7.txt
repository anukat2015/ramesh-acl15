Title: BEWARE BOSCH!
Content:
Bosch customer service is an nonexistent. The ONLY authorized service center in the US is in NY. As to my experience, I own the immediate predecessor to this model. After a few months use, when pulling out (without any excessive force) the self-retracting power cord, the whole cord detached from the vacuum. According to Bosch, this is a problem they do not cover under warranty. Estimates for repair from several shops were well over $100.00.

Title: Simply Amazing
Content:
I have had my vac for about 2 months now and my carpet, allergies, and how frequent I vacuum have improved.  I have sever allergies, 2 cats and 1 bird and all of us give off hair or feathers.  I had a bissell which I have replaced 3 times in one year because the brush housing kept burning up.  I bought this one and was simply amazed at how well it cleaned.  I went from vacuuming ab ut twice a week to almost everyday.  With my other vacuums you could smell the dust in the air, but with this there is nothing but clean air!  I get so much dirt and hair up and out of the other side of the Earth I guess.  I had no idea how much my other vacuum was leaving behind.  My sister has a Dyson she got at a wedding shower, whcih is an AWESOME vac, but expensive.  The only difference in the two is size.  The Dyson is larger therefore it can hold more dirt, but I empty the cup after I vacuum  roughly each room.  I can do my whole 1960 square foot house and empty the cup about 4 times.  I love being able to clean the system by rinsing it and leaving it to dry in the shower.  I wash it out more than it calls for, but I have sever allergies and want it to work at its peak performance as much as possible.  Despite the fact that I have cheap, cheap carpet, this vacuum cleaner makes having carpet almost as good as having hard wood floors, almost!  If you have considered the Dyson, consider the Infinty you will surprise yourself.

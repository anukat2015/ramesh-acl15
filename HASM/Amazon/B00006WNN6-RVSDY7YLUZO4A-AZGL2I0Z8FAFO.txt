Title: A heater is supposed to... heat
Content:
Not only does it have a very strong plastic odor that is overwhelming but it does not put out much heat at all. It barely blows out and I have to be inches from it to feel any heat what-so-ever. I would send it back but I really dont want to bother with all that. I would choose another heater for sure.

Title: Nice upgrades from 5G
Content:
I bought this as a replacement for my 5G 60GB Video that was stolen at the YMCA.  The upgraded interface is a nice refresh from the old one.  There was nothing wrong with the old 5G interface - just that the enhancements of the 6G are a bit cooler.  The cover-page flip setting is pretty useless if you ask me.  On a 160GB iPod where most people have thousands of songs, it would take forever to scroll through to find what you want.  Plus, about half of the cover pages are blank so unless you have all of the cover graphic files on your iTunes it really is not very helpful.  The bonus is that you can turn this feature off.  So far I think the sound is on par with the old 5G.  The sound variation between songs usually equates more to the quality of the file, rather than the iPod itself.  Sounds good on my Apple Hi-Fi too.

Title: Canon Digital Rebel XT
Content:
As a new user of digital cameras, I bought this unit kinda on a whim.  I'd purchased its 35mm film-based cousin last month and when my wife's Minolta point-and-shoot started acting up, I figured it was time for an upgrade; and since most of my former camera work was done with 35mm SLRs with real glass lenses, I opted for something that looked familiar.  Only after I bought the Rebel did I find out that it was a fairly well-rated camera.
Two things that caught me off guard: 1) it doesn't come with a memory card, and 2) it doesn't support video recording.  Neither of these are deal breakers, but for a $500 camera a $1 memory card should have been in included.  And the non-video capture ability just surprises me as I see this feature in lower priced units.
I'll update this review after spending some time using the camera.

Title: It's okay
Content:
"iPod Nano holds 1000 songs and thousands of photos on 4 GB of storage " Not quite true. You will find you have about 3.6 GB for your music. I got half the advertised 1000 songs. The earphones are useless. Expect to shell out some more bucks for some decent ones. The LCD shows a small icon of the Album Artwork. Waste to download that info if you can not see on the screen. The LCD is bright. You will need sunglasses to read the text though. The Toshiba delivers better sound quality but it is a much heavier unit.

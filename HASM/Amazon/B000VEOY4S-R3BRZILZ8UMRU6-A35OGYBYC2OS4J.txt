Title: Best vacuum ever for pet hair
Content:
This thing is amazing! After going through several vacuums throughout the years and never really finding one that works with pet hair, I'm ecstatic with the Black & Decker Bagless Canister. It gets hair off of hardwood floor and carpeting, and does wonders on furniture, shades, etc. It gets stuff from underneath furniture and other hard to reach areas with it's suction power and great attachments. It really does the trick no matter what you need to pick up. It handles any job with ease and has the power, features and usability of a very expensive unit. It's easy to clean, doesn't fill up quickly and is an all around excellent buy for anyone in the market for a vacuum, not just per owners. I highly recommend this vacuum!

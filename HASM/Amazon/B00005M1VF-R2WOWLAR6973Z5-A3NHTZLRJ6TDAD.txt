Title: Great machine - compare with Black &amp; Decker
Content:
I spent a great deal of time reading other people's reviews to figure out if the Black &amp; Decker one-cup was a better deal.  I've owned an older B&amp;D for 4 years and it worked great.  But this is a better, if slightly more expensive, coffeemaker.  + No more overflows when using fine ground coffees+ No  cleanup mess dumping coffee grounds from the permanent basket. + Very solid stainless mugs (but must hand wash them)+ Coffee tastes better.  - The &quot;on&quot; switch on the side forces you to grab the machine with both hands to avoid sliding the unit.

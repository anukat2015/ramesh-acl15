Title: Big leap from a Point and Shoot
Content:
I am a complete amateur with no desire to enter into the professional world.  I just want to take great pics of my kids.  I LOVE this camera!!!!!  I use the auto setting and the pics are unbelievable.  From the moment I picked it up out of the box (literally) it has surpassed all my expectations and I've captured some truly amazing shots.  My point-and-shoot (canon sd1100 which I still keep in my purse for snapshots) maybe, maybe would have been fast enough to catch the same look on my kids faces, but the depth of field and color from the d90 are just breathtaking.
I'm sure if I learned to use all the settings I could do even more.  And eventually I will, because it does seem pretty easy to navigate the menus and the buttons are all pretty clear.  For now, I just wanted to move up to a higher image quality from the point-and-shoots, and the entry level DSLRs felt too plasticy and cheap for their price.  This does not.  It is still plastic, but feels solid, not like I could break it with too tight a grip.
The only real problem I had with it was the shoulder strap was ugly and uncomfortable.  I found a really nice replacement strap at a camera store for about $15.
So if you are an amateur just looking for something better than what's available on the point-and-shoot market, this is a very useable, non-intimidating camera that will suit you needs.

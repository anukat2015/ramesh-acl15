Title: Awful...not durable
Content:
Hi
I bought this heater at Home Depot and was very happy initially. It did an awesome job at heating my garage. It would heat up my 2 car garage from high 50s to high 60s in a couple of hours. But, I needed something that could work in the garage for 3 to 4 hrs everyday. A month after we bought it, it broke down....it would not start up...
Awful - not durable at all.

Title: Enjoying the Tassimo 65
Content:
We received this Tassimo for Christmas and we love it.  We are trying different T-discs (Gevalia, Maxwell House, Starbucks, Seattle) and like some better than others.
Pros:
Very hot water - a must!
Large water container
Versatile: you can control the amount of water in your drink to make it stronger or weaker
Great cappucino! (We like Maxwell House best.)
Cons:
Expensive T-discs, lots of plastic that can't be recycled.
Overall, great product!

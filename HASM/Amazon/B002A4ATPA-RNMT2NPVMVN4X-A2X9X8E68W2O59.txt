Title: Great Product...but...
Content:
I love my Sony laptop but there are a few things that drive me nutz!
The LCD screen is super only if you are looking directly at it.  As soon as you get off axis, up/down, left/right the screen washes out.  Also, Blu-rays look great but with the reduced color of a DVD the blacks look funny, almost like an x-ray.
Bottom-line the Sony eco-screen sux.  And the power supply might be a little under powered since it gets very warm.  Finally, Sony doesn't give you much in the way of directions on how to use the various features of this computer, can you say "trial-n-error?"
On the plus side, it's fast and quiet.  Love the Blu-ray drive, the color/textured finish and the fact you can turn the display off while the computer is still running, the built-in wireless-N and Sony's video camera.  But Sony, what happened to the built-in BlueTooth?
Over-all it's a pretty good computer for the money.

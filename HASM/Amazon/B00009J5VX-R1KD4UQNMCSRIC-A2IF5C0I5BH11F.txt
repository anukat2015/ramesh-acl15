Title: 10GB iPod
Content:
This is pretty expensive for an MP3 player, but its worth it!  It is small and attractive in design.  It's also pretty easy to use - I've had little trouble with mine.  I have a PC with Windows XP, so far, so good!  The one issue is that it comes with a firewire port, while most PCs these days use USB ports.  You can get a converter for like $20, but that part is kind of annoying.It holds a decent amount of songs, 10 GB is quite a lot!  I don't even have mine close to 1/4 full!  It works well, though I invested in a better pair of headphones because the ones it comes with are kinda crappy!  Overall - I think it is overpriced, but it is attractively built, holds lots of songs, is easy to use and works well!

Title: Not great, not bad
Content:
Best feature - speed.  From switching on to taking a shot is almost instant, compared to other DSLRs that take a few seconds to boot before being ready to shoot (eg. Canon EOS). So you don't miss candid moments. For journalists, that's fabulous.
Worst feature - color balance.  I've tried so many setting alternatives and this camera consistently yields slightly under-saturated, cold (ie. slightly blueish) pictures. Same experienced by reviewers on dpreview.com.  It's fixable by most photo editing software like Picasa or Photoshop, but is annoying.
Overall, better than most of its peers but I expected a more finished, tuned package.

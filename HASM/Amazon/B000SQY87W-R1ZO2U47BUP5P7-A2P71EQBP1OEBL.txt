Title: This Portable AC is Great!
Content:
So, I was totally worried when I had to purchase this portable air conditioner because my boss told me to choose one because everyone was complaining about how hot it was and stuff and I had bought stuff on Amazon before but not a lot ( like 1 cent BSB records and stuff). So I was looking at price and reviews and decided on this one and what do you know, it works so good. Now noe is complaining anymore and my boss wasn't mad about the price (because I used his credit card ---should've written down the number, darn). Just kidding, I wouldn't steal from my boss. Anyway, it was really easy to set up. I didn't even have to call in the guys from IT or anything. And then we just turned it on and cool air started coming out. Easy as that. Oh, and air-n-water was good too I guess. i'm not sure how it works, but  I think they sent it to me and it came pretty fast.

Title: Great player...lack of support
Content:
Let's face it, we live in an ipod world. Technically the Zune is superior to the 30GB ipod in every way. Unfortunatly the Zune software and marketplace leave alot to be desired. The firmware upgrades for the device are not comming fast enough. Good luck trying to find accessories readily available.
I use my Zune every day and love it's performance, but come on Microsoft, unlock this beast's potential already.
Until there is adaequate support, I would recommend to anyone looking for an MP3 player to buy a Zen.

Title: Nice heater that simply works well.

Lasko 751320 Ceramic Tower Heater with Remote Control
Small, reasonably quiet, and the thermostat actually works! This heats a tiny bathroom and a small bedroom to a reasonable warmth quickly. I'm very satisfied with it. I like that it oscillates. The remote, which slips into a small "holster" on the back of the heater, seems reasonably pointless, but some folks may want to fool with it, I suppose. It works fine. I would certainly buy this heater again, should this one fail in the next, say, 15 years... (I expect longevity from such products.)

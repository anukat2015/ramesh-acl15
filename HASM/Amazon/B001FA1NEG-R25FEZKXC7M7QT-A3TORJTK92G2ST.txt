Title: My First iPod- and I Love it!!!
Content:
I purchased the blue 8GB iPod Nano about a month ago, and so far, I love it! I can't believe I waited so long to buy one! For me, it's very simple to use, from adding music and video to navitgating the menus. My only issues with it so far are the battery life (I have to charge it pretty much every other day), and it has frozen up on me a couple times. Fortunately, it's easy to reset when it does freeze. If you're new to the iPod game, and you NEED the screen (like I do), but not a lot of space for your music, this is a very good one to have! Love the choice of colors, also!

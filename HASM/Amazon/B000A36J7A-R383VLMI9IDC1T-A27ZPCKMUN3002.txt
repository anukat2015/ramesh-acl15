Title: Solid and Reliable
Content:
I understand some of the complaints but for the most part it sometimes comes down to whether or not you were unlucky enough to just get a bad system from the company. Fortunately, like most, I got a perfect working Gateway M305CRV years ago and it still bulldozes through whenever I need it to. Powerful enough to use high graphics software like Photoshop CS3 and connects to internet perfectly. I've never had any system problems (other than the ones I brought upon myself lol). The bad reviews are probably true but I think it's because they had a bad system. Notice there are only a few?? lol The rest, like me got the real deal. D*** fine computer! I have to say 5 stars for longevity, reliability, and utility. They can't all be winners, but mine definitely was.

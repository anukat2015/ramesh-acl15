Title: Pretty good computer - 6 hour battery life.
Content:
I have to admit that although I've only had this computer one day, I am really happy with it's look and performance. It's the best laptop I've ever owned, and I really didn't have to spend a lot of money on it. 
I charge my battery to full, and it says that I only have 6 hours. I'm sure I can change the settings and lower the power performance to get extra batter life. 
This would be one of the best laptops on Earth if it had a blu-ray player built in. 
I'm sure in a few years time, blu-rays will be common on all laptops. 
I'm please that this comes with a nice built in webcam and dvd super drive. 
64bit Windows 7 Home Premium is awesome! I can't believe how fast this laptop run! Takes about 15 to 20 seconds to boot up, and 12 seconds to shut down. 
I am very happy with the way technology is progressing. 
I give this ASUS laptop an A- grade.
I will update this in approx. 6 months time.

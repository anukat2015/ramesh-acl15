Title: Nikon D90 kit
Content:
Im not big on words so I'll keep it short. I bought this camera to upgrade from my D40, the difference was hard to see at first. As there were alot of new features to learn and alot of fumbling around before I broke down and read the instruction book. But once I figured it all out the picture quality was nothing short of impresive. My shots just seem more alive now, and the colors pre editing now are wonderful. The kit lense actually works in quite a few different situations and ranges and is a great addition aswell. Just wish the kit had some filters, either way a wonderful Purchase that I am quite pleased with. 
I would note though the bag that comes with it sucks. It will work for just this, but if you want another lense or some more equipment you will want a bigger one.

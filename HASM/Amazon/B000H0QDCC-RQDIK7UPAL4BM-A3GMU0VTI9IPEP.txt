Title: Does what it's suppose to do.
Content:
Nice to see the IPOD clones bashing Microsoft."Wait for the widescreen IPOD", etc. Steve Jobs said it best. We want you to buy an IPOD every year. Nice product, not.I owned an IPOD, and let me tell you, the Zune hasn't locked up on me once, which isn't something I can say about the pod.Also, Microsoft doesn't use IPOD like software that will make it a pain in the arse to move files around. Message to the clones. Buying ITUNES content is the worst mistake you can make. When my digital certificates were corrupted, Apple said there was nothing they could do when I wanted my tunes back, even though I PAID for them and could prove it. Scammers.

Title: as good, the second time around
Content:
This is our second Krups FME4-14. I broke the first one...oops! and we can't fault them. I kocked the carafe off of the counter while vaccuuming, and unfortunately it broke, so when I asked my wife what she wanted to replace it, she said another the same. The store we bought it from no longer had them in stock, so I came to Amazon. Should have done that first, it was cheaper than I saw anywhere else on the internet, and it arrived well before it was expected. Thank you

Title: Excellent value laptop
Content:
This is an excellent value laptop. The last two laptops I purchased were ACERs (an Extensa for my wife) after having previously purchased a Sony, a Toshiba and a HP.  I am very satisfied with the AS4810TZ. I wanted a lightweight (~4lbs), thin (~1"), =&lt;14" display, DVD drive.  I carefully considered the ASUS, Toshiba and HP similar machines and settled on the ACER.
+'s:  battery life is fantastic, speed of startup/shutdown, ease of setup and backup, excellent LED display, keyboard; HDMI connection, case style, low case temperature rise
-'s:  OEM software, keyboard fingerprint magnet, no decent manual in package or online.
I am very happy with this purchase.

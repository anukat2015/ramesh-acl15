Title: Lovin' My iPod
Content:
I received my first iPod as a present.  I am not a tech guru, but love all the new stuff coming out.  I was intimidated by the iPod at first, but within 5 minutes I was downloading music and shuffling songs.  I thought I never needed an iPod, till now, I am addicted.

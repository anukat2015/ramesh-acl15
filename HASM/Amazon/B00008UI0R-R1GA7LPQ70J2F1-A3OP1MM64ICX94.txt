Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
This is our second Hoover WindTunnel - loved the first one so much we bought a second.  You cannot beat the suction/cleaning of this vacuum and isn't that the whole point in buying a vacuum?
My only complaint is some extra parts seem to be made cheaply...but for the price you cannot beat this vacuum and the cheap parts do not reflect the overall operation of the vacuum.
Will buy another when this one needs replacing.

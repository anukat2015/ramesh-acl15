Title: good heater, but simple
Content:
This heater is effective at heating a small space. I wish it had a few more features -- a "quiet" / "efficient", less than 900W mode, and a better (digital, with readout) thermostat. I've pretty much worked around those deficiencies by finding an old (unused) wall socket timer, so it only turns on for 30 mins a day when I need it (during the night when central heating isn't on). The unit is also pretty noisy, though not to the point of being disruptive to anyone in neighboring rooms. It usually takes 30 mins to bring my 15x20 room from 40 degrees to (I'm guessing) 65 on the 900W mode.

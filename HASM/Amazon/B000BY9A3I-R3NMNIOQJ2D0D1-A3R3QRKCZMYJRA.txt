Title: A good little machine
Content:
This cute little sucker is easy to use, has good suction and is much easier to use & less clunky than past cannister vacs I've owned and the retractible cord is a nice feature. It requires very little storage space.
The tool caddy on the wand is useless.. the head on the bare floor tool has a nice flexibility for shoving under beds & furniture but it might scuff some floors (mine are old and any new scuffs wouldn't be noticed) I hear abrasion more than see any. A plusher dusting brush would be nice but this one is useable. Chances are, you might have a better one from a previous machine that'll fit.
I don't find the hepa filter difficult to clean and it's certainly worth the bother to save inhaling fine particles or finding fine dust settling after using the machine. It did a great job sucking up animal fluff, dander & pollen. I didn't realize how much fine dust I had in my house till I found flour-like grey powder in that filter. I'm glad not to be breathing it or wiping surfaces w/a dustcloth as often.
I use an upright on my carpet but wanted a handy cannister to do the periferal areas and uncarpeted bedrooms. This little cutie fits my needs perfectly.
It'll handle small accent rugs okay, but if your world is mostly plushly carpeted, you might want something else. I'm pleased with this vacuum cleaner and Amazon's price was a bargain.. much lower than "sale" prices in my area and shipping was included!

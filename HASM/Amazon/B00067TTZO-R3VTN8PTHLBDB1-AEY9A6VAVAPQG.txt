Title: Great player!
Content:
I love this player, this is my second Mp3 player, first one being the Creative Nomad2. Firmware upgrade is a MUST for Zen micro. It was very tough to 'create' cons for this player. 
Con:
I am sort of jealous that 'click wheel' belongs to Ipod, the touch pad of Zen Micro is very good, but since its a vertical bar pad, as your thumb reaches the end, you have to lift the thumb for further browing. so much work! but this is an excuse only for extremely lazy guys like me.
Pro: 
1.Good Battery life
2.Good Music Quality
2.Drag-and-drop feature doesnt require any 'seamless integration with a software'
3.Compatible to Subscription music(i use Yahoo unlimited)
Other:
with Flash-based players catching up to 5Gb capacity, this might soon vanish.

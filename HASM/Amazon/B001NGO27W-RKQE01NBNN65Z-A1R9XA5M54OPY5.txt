Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
My wife and I have been serious coffee drinkers for the past 10 years.  After our Braun thermal (which we loved) died on us, we had a difficult decision to make.  I studied many different makes and models and finally decided on the Cuisinart 2600.  We've had it for 2 weeks now and love it!  We can't find one flaw.  One reviewer mentioned the coffee wasn't hot enough.  Their unit must be faulty because ours brews hot and maintains very hot coffee with a medium heat setting.  The water filter holder even has a long handle so you can easily place it a slot in the bottom of the water reservoir.  The designers afforded a lot of time and attention to the details.  A must buy for serious coffee drinkers.

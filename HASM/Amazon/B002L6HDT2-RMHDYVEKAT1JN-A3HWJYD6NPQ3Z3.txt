Title: A lot for a little
Content:
The newest generation, the 5th generation IPOD NANO, is truly a sight to behold.  Small, super thin, and full of toys, the new nano competes if not exceeds any expectations for an mp3 player.  Combine amazing sound and the dependability of an ipod with an FM tuner, video camera, and video playback, and you've got the newest NANO.  I absolutely love mine.  And at just over $150 its definitely affordable.

Title: A negative 5.  Do not buy a Bissell vacuum cleaner!
Content:
I purchased this vacuum because I have a dog that sheds and I read positive reviews.  They are lies.  This vacuum cleaner spits out dirt.  Several times, I've gotten it to work a little bit by running hangers through the clogged up hoses, which I have had to do EVERY TIME I've even tried to vacuum my rug.  I've given up. I've hardly used this vacuum cleaner and can no longer get it to pick up anything, with any attachment.  I've never seen anything like it.  It should be advertised as the UNVACUUM cleaner or the REVERSE vacuum cleaner.  A weapon of mass destruction for your home. A science project gone awry.  It's going to the Goodwill store.  Perhaps a "vacuum mechanic" will buy it and get it to work.  I wish I could return it, but don't have the box or receipt.  I will never purchase a Bissell product again and I hope you won't either.

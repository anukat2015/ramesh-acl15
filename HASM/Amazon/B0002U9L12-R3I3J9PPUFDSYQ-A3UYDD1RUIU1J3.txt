Title: Glad I didn't spend the extra dough on the cuisinart
Content:
I had the Cuisinart grind and brew for ages. When it came time to get a new coffee maker I thought about getting it again, but I'm glad I skipped the extra expense and got the Mr. Coffee instead. Nothing against Cuisinart - their Grind and Brew is a fantastic product. I just want something that's simple, easy to use, easy to clean and does what it's supposed to do. 
I get up at O' Dark Thirty every morning while my significant other sleeps in. I program the timer the night before (very easy to do) and every morning I have tasty, hot coffee. When he gets up an hour or two later, the coffee is still hot and delicious. 
The other thing I like about Mr. Coffee is that there are fewer parts to clean. It doesn't have a grinder, so that simplifies things a a lot, but with that Cuisinart I had to scrape it out once a week and fish the beans out of weird places. 
Anyway, big thumbs up for the Mr. Coffee. One last note: please consider getting the re-usable filter. It's better for the environment, you know. It also makes for better-tasting coffee.

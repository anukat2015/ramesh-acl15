Title: Miele versus kenmore
Content:
I bought miele S5981 top of line to replace my 6 years old progressive
kenmore canister vacuum. It is sleek, lightweight and less noisy.
On the other hand its performance is less than progressive kenmore which
was great in performance but required a lot of repair within the last 5 years. Miele durability supposed to be better but it is still too early to tell. With the price for miele you can get 2 kenmore vacuums.

Title: dont go for this...
Content:
granted that this product was originally defective and now refurbished.. but one would expect a factory reconditioned product like this to put out more heat than a household electrical appliance  ..
My laptop computer produces more heat while operating for heaven sakes and has a nice fan inside too.
Its hard to tell whether its working in the 'min' and 'med' settings and you start to feel it heating up a little bit only in the maximum setting.('min' + 'med'). The heat it produces is absolutely inadequate even for a small 200sqft room.
I would return this piece of junk if i could but for its sheer weight and shipping charges.
Shame on Amazon and Delonghi for selling such defective products as "factory reconditioned".
I would be extremely wary in the future about purchasing any refurbished products from amazon.

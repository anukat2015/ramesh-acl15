Title: FInally took the plunge!
Content:
First, some background.
I'm currently 23, and I've been shooting with film SLRs since the age of 6. My dad has always been a camera nut, and thus, I became one too. While I would never say any of my old models were "pro" (mostly old Minolta models), they were still an SLR, and as a result, they were a great lesson on photography growing up. As I got older, I became interested in filmmaking and purchased a Panasonic DVX100 video camera, which was a fantastic piece of equipment. I held on to it for about 4 years, and did many projects with it.
NOW, when I first heard all the business about DSLRs and video modes, I scoffed. I instantly thought about the video mode on my crummy old point and shoot, which is, in so many words, awful. Then I saw footage. Incredible! It took me a while to be completely sold, but eventually I was ready to sell my beloved DVX to purchase a DSLR. I finally, after much debate (mostly between the 7d and the GH1), I settled on the Canon 7d.
This camera is great. I've been wanting to get back into still photography again, and this is my first DSLR, so I'm excited for that, on top of the video mode. Both have performed to my expectations, sometimes beyond. The body feels extremely rugged, and the weight makes you realize it's not some cheapy plastic. I guess the easiest way to not make this review 10 pages would be a pro and con list, so here we go:
PROS:
-Feels very rugged, yet comfortable. I'm not so paranoid about having it out in scenarios that would have made me nervous with my DVX
-Still quality is great
-Auto-focus seems good, but I've really never taken much to auto-focus, so I'm probably not the best authority to talk on this. It's very fast, but I prefer manual control in most situations.
-Live view is great in still and video mode. The zoom function is something that I've found invaluable for focusing.
-HD video is amazing. Moving from SD to HD was a huge bump from the DVX, and I love the quality, sharpness, and detail. Dynamic range is much nicer than the DVX as well.
-Battery life is better than expected
-Didn't buy the kit lens, but the Canon 50mm 1.4 works great on this body and delivers wonderful results.
CONS
-As I mentioned, I've used SLRs before, and tinkered with some other DSLRs before, so the learning curve for me was mostly finding what settings are where, but I can see the learning curve being fairly steep for a complete new comer.
-Anyone interested in the video mode who has done even a small bit of research knows of some of the limitaons of the camera (rolling shutter, "jello" effect, etc). These are annoyances, but something I'm willing to put up with considering the overall quality and price point
-Photography, as I tend to forget from time to time, is an EXPENSIVE hobby. Lenses, battery grips, stabilization systems (for video), tripods, etc. The costs DO add up, so make sure you're committed to the craft before you get started, otherwise you'll be disappointed how quickly you can pour money into this stuff (I assume most people realize this, but always good to mention, even though it's not at all specific to the 7d).
Well, I think that's more or less it. I love the camera so far and have no regrets about my purchase. Look forward to using it on some upcoming projects!

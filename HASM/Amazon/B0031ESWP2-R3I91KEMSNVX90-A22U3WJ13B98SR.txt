Title: Great Laptop but....
Content:
Let me start off by saying that this is a fantastic laptop with great features and price and I am very happy with it. There is nothing I can add about the specs that has not already been covered in the many reviews. Its fast, responsive and can hold its own performing most tasks. And I love the HDMI output that lets me connect it to my LCD. The only thing that irks me is that this product might have the most volatile pricing on Amazon. Two days after I bought it, the price dropped like 30 dollars. Also Amazon has a policy where once they ship an item to you they will not price match it. Apart from that this is a great Laptop and you can buy this with confidence as this has the best specs in its price range.

Title: Weak coffee that spills all over the counter
Content:
We used this product trouble free for about 4 months.  
On the positive side, it uses a lot less electricity because there is no hot plate to keep warm.
On the negative side, the cover leaks.  So you always get a few drops of coffee on the counter whenever you pour a cup.
On the really negative side, it has started dumping coffee all over the counter and floor like many other reviewers have mentioned.  We cleaned the cover and checked the mechanisms.  I don't see anything obviously wrong with it.
I also wish we had known before purchasing that the coffee is very weak and there is no way to control the strength.  To get a robust cup, you need to use a lot of extra coffee which may offset any savings you are getting on your electric bill.

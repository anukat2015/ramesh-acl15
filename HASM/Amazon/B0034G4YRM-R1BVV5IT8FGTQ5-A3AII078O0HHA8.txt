Title: Great value for power, functionality, features (NV7919u)
Content:
I have a core i7 quad 3.07ghz desktop Gateway FX series and after quite a bit of research, I decided to go with this model as I wanted something portable for the rest of the house since the FX desktop is in the home theater downstairs. My main selling feature was great performance features(core i5, 4gb ram, SATA hdd, 17.3" nice screen, HDMI out, etc) and having the blu-ray player built in already (as opposed to installing it later down the road or having an external drive). 
I can compare it to a Dell Studio 15 Duo core processor at 2.8 ghz that was purchased by my fiance within the last year for about $1400. This computer blows it away not only in price, but also style, performance, features, screen, components, pretty much everything.
This Gateway NV7919u laptop has a huge screen, sitting next to a Dell Studio 15, it looks like a monster. The LCD is good build quality with bright colors and decent blacks. This laptop looks great too with a carbon fiber-like outside and black sleek keyboard area with some media buttons at the top. It looks better in person than the pictures show.
This computer is for the performace-minded person(core i5 is decent) who doesn't mind the size, wants to multi-task with a large amount of media without being slowed down, including movies- HD and SD, pictures, media burning, maybe some light gaming, and possibly using this laptop's HDMI out as a blu-ray player in a pinch (I've hooked it up to the 3 HDTV's in the house and it works well- although they all have dedicated blu-ray players and receivers). Not quite as good as the stand-alone blu-ray players, but looks decent on a Samsung 40" 650, 61" DLP, and 52" 750B series LCD-tv's. One thing I haven't tested much of is the battery life, but it appears to last at least 3 hours with all the power-savings things down or off.
If you don't need the blu-ray player in a laptop, this exact configuration (core i5, 4gb DDR3 ram, 500gb SATA hdd, 1.7gb on-board graphics, 17.3" screen, HDMI out, etc) can be had for approximately $100-$200 less made by Gateway model number 7923u Gateway NV7923u 17.3-Inch Laptop (NightSky Black) for $679 at the time of writing which represents a stunning amount of features for price. Again, the blu-ray was important enough for me to pay the extra money, although for most people the other model should be great.
Overall, this laptop is a powerhouse that performs with the best of them, with a good LCD screen, great components including a blu-ray player, and great features especially given the sub $1000 price tag($799 at the time of writing).

Title: Nikon D90 worth every penny.
Content:
I compared the D90 to other cameras on display in Best Buy and Circuit City.  You can perform this same test easily.  Take a picture with the D90 of an area across the store.  Take a picture of the same area with any other SLR camera the store happens to have on hand.  Zoom in on the printing in your picture.  The D90 will beat all the others in its price range.  You will be able to read the fine print on the D90 screen and you will be able to read the fine print in your pictures.  The other cameras simply can't show as much detail.  Enough said.Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens

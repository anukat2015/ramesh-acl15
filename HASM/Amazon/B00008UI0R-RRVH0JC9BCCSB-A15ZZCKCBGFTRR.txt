Title: It is a good vacuum cleaner
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner after I read other customers reviews and they were very helpful. The vacuum is easy to use, it is powerful and I can use it to clean the carpet under my bed where other cleaners didn't reach. It is also very easy to empty and you don't have to bother about buying bags. However, I have only used this product for two weeks.

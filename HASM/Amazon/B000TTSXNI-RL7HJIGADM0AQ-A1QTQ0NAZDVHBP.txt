Title: Better than all others
Content:
I bought and returned 4 heaters before I got this one.  My room has 10' ceilings and is quite large.  this heater really does  the job.  the remote is a nice feature.  The only negative is that it does not have ahandle to move, but that is a minor thing.  I like it a lot.

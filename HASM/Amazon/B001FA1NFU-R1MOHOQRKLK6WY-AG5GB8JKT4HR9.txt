Title: Best Nano Yet
Content:
I own a 1 GB Nano 1st Gen. and a 30GB iPod. This 4th Gen Nano is slim, smooth, and sleek. A larger screen without compromising on size. I would recommend this iPod for any general user. 
If you want to put an extensive library on an iPod than you will obviously need one with more memory but an 8GB allows for plenty of podcasts, music, and videos for several days.

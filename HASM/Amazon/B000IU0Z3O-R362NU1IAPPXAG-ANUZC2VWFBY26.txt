Title: vacuum
Content:
I had bought a stand up vacuum($177) last year that Consumer Report rated high. What a disaster!!!!!!!!! It was too heavy for me and it was difficult to use and it burned the fringe on my oriental rug. I borrowed a friend's Panasonic, loved it and immediately ordered one. I can lift it with one finger; the suction is strong but does not destroy fringe and it takes little storage space. My apt is now cleaner than ever because I can do my rugs myself without hiring someone or getting a friend to vacuum -out of desperation! I had difficulty giving away my old vacuum because it was too heavy for people-even a 6 ft guy. The PANASONIC does turn over fairly easily but nothing is perfect and the price is very affordable.

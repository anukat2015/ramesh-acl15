Title: I am drink master, master of drinks.
Content:
I'm sure there are fancier machines out there, but after a rocky (user learning curve) couple of days, I am officially creating drinks on this thing that make it hard to justify spending $5+ at a coffee shop. I suppose my advice is to treat the handles gently (as I noticed the other reviews citing them as an issue), but not to scare yourself into paying more when this product delivers oh so deliciously.

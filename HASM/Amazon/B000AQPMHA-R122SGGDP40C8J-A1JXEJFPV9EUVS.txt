Title: Get your coffee on!
Content:
I purchased the Keurig B40 single cup coffee maker after reading the reviews and searching for it in stores.I am not a huge coffee drinker so for those who are not as well, this item is good for you too. It brews hot water, cocoa, tea and coffee. It takes only about 2 mins from start to finish. Put the cup in the holder, hit the button and 2 mins later, you have a full cup of beverage. It does make some noise when the heating element is warming up but after that, it runs smooth and is the perfect addition to the appliances in the kitchen. No more heating up a huge kettle of water on the stove or preparing a coffee maker that makes 30 cups of coffee and you only need 1 cup in the morning. If you are considering purchasing one, I give this 2 thumbs up and say go for it, you won't be sorry. It's well worth the price. I chose the B40 because it was the best for what I needed. The B30 was just to small and the B50 / B60 was to large. I only need a cup of coffee or tea. That's like buying a Ferrari to drive to Walmart. It looks good sitting in the parking lot but it serves the same purpose as a Ford Focus so, why pay all that money just for a cup of coffee? But that's just my 2 cents. As always....YMMV. NEOSOUL06

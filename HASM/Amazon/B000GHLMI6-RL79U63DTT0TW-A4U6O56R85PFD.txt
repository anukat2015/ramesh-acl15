Title: Finally, no carafe
Content:
My bride and I have owned probably a half-dozen or so coffeemakers during out 15-year marriage. We both love coffee in the morning, and we like to have it piping hot and ready when we rise. We've had some very good coffeemakers and owned a variety of brands and models. But all but two had one major Achilles' heel - a glass carafe. However hard we might try, those glass carafes always got broken. And when they got broken, the unanimous refrain from stores and manufacturers was: "Sorry, we don't offer that version anymore." So, it was a new coffeemaker or nothing.
We also owned one of those fancy units with an insulated carafe. Well, at least for the unit we bought, that cuts two ways. Yes, the coffee inside is insulated from the frigid winds of our kitchen. It is also effectively insulated from a warmer (which the unit did not have or, obviously, need). Now I can tell you that, with the possible exception of the most secret research bowels of NASA, there is no insulated carafe in the universe that is as effective as a warmer unless one consumes one's coffee very quickly.
Not only does this unit make great coffee, there is no carafe to break!! Or wash!! Thank you, thank you, thank you Hamilton Beach. We love it. 
One caveat: when the user's manual tells you to regularly descale the unit, do so. Else the machine will get sulky and simply refuse to brew your coffee. It's probably unionized, who knows, but it does effectively sit down on the job. Now the manual has been fine tuned by an attorney and recommends descaling monthly. Given the levels of dissolved mineral in our water, we descale once every six months and all is fine.

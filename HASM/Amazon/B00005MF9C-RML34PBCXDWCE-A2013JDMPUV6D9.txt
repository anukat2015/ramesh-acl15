Title: What a great idea!
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker for home about 2 months ago and I love it!  It is extremely convenient to be able to quickly brew coffee for just one person.  The best features of this unit are:1.  It has a built in, &quot;permanent&quot; filter which is a HUGE plus. No more running out of filters, EVER.2.  It is fast.  In just a couple minutes I can go from sleep to sipping coffee.3.  It brews the coffee right into the travel mug.  The unit I bought included an extra mug which is also a great convenience.4.  It is inexpensive!The only downside I can see is that I would have made the travel mugs a bit larger, but that is not a serious problem.  I would buy this coffeemaker again without hesitation.

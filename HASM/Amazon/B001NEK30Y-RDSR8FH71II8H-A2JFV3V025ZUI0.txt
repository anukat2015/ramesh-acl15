Title: Great Laptop With Powerhouse Components
Content:
I bought this laptop because it had the best combination of features and specs that I could find. The machine itself is very nicely constructed and has a solid feel to it. As others have pointed out, it's impossible to keep fingerprints of it's many shiny surfaces so a cleaning cloth is a must. I have been able to play any and all current generation PC games with all setting set to maximum and experienced no lags in framerate (at all). Also the sound quality from this thing is really impressive. I travel quite a bit and it's nice to set the machine up in a hotel room and listen to soothing music.
One gripe I have is that the USB charging function does not seem to work at all! I have a wide variety of USB devices and have tried them all. None of them receive any charge from the machine when it is off. This "Sleep and Charge" function was one of the major considerations for me when I was looking for a new laptop, so it was a big disappointment to  have it not work. 
The fiery red color scheme is a bit much. I get what Toshiba was trying to do, but if I would have had a choice (like Black), I would have definitely opted for something less "Hot-Rod".
All in all, I am pleased with this machine and would recommend it to anyone considering a high-end laptop.

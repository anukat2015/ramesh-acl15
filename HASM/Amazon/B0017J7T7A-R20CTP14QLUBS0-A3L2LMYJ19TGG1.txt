Title: Love it to pieces!
Content:
I've had an iMac at home for almost 2 years, and finally decided to get a laptop for when I needed the computer to be portable. First, I got a MacBook thinking it would have everything I need, but after a few days of playing around with it, I realized it's really the MacBook Pro that I wanted. So I returned the MacBook, bought the MacBook Pro and haven't regretted the trade one bit ever since. So totally in love with my new laptop, I am. I've hardly touched the iMac since the MBP came home. :)

Title: Made more fun with downloads...
Content:
The iPod video is a great device. I bought it because i killed my mini and i wanted the video capability.  It a nuisance that it doesn't come with a charger, but i had the old mini one so...i like the device overall, it's just frustrating that you have to download 3rd party things to put DVDs you already own on it, but it's not so bad.  the battery life is decent and i charge mine every other day. i do use it every day so it's to be expected. The back is easy to scratch so that's the only major complaint

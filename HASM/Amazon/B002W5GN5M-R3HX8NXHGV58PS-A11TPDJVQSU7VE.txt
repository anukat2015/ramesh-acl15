Title: Fantastic Laptop
Content:
After searching for a notebook for a few weeks and reading up on them, I found an acer at best buy I liked. While there I searched the Best buy site and found this laptop for 429. Best buy wanted to charge me 69.99 for having it optimized already and putting the OS onto cds. I told them I wanted the advertised price and I can create the OS discs myself. Finally they gave it to me for the advertised price and I wound up having it optimized and the discs were in the box as well. Not bad!
This notebook can perform just as good if not better than the more expensive models? Oh yes. I am still trying to figure out why would someone buy the 800 hp over this one? The only difference I can see is that the higher priced HPs have larger drives, but who is going to store that much info on their computers? Ram is more important than storage. You can get a 1tb drive for 100 bucks. So no need to spend and extra 400 on storage especially when the ram is only 3! 
I am so happy with this model. Fast, efficient, windows 7 is fantastic. Much faster than vista and xp. Sound is awesome.  Very happy with this laptop and the money I saved. Highly recommend this one.

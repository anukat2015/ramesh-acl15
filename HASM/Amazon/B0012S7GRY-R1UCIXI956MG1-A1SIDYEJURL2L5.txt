Title: Very nice!
Content:
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She loves it.  I have the previous generation Nano, and now I'm jealous.  She loves the size and the ability to watch videos.  I downloaded "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" cartoon (one of her childhood favorites) and it looks and sounds wonderful.  Nice job, Apple!

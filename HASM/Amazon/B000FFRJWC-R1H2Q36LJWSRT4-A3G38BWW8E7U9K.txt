Title: Worst Purchase Ever
Content:
I hate this vaccuum. The entire length of the hose gets clogges with fibers and it is ridiculous to try to empty out. It flicks bits of kitty litter out the back pricking my ankles. I want to donate it to goodwill but feel it would be an act of cruelty to give it to someone else. I have absolutley no respect for Eureka or the "good housekeeping seal of approval." This is an awful, awful item. Buy something else or look forward to regret.

Title: Love it!!!
Content:
I was so excited to replace my 4th generation iPod with the 2nd gen iPod touch.  Of course this was a major upgrade.  It's great to have the speaker, which isn't that loud at the highest volume, if I just want to listen without earbuds.  The volume control on the side is also a great feature.  It's fun to have the applications.  I love how I can download apps or songs directly onto the iPod via wifi.  Then when I connect it to iTunes, the apps and songs are backed up. 
My only issue is not being able to use my old iPod car charger.  It can only be charged with the usb cable.  Luckily it has a battery life for up to 36 hours audio or 6 hours video.
Overall, I think it's a fun gadget to have.  I'm looking forward to watching movies on it during road trips or at work when no one is around.

Title: Electrolux has regressed with technology.
Content:
We purchased this vacuum cleaner and were greatly disappointed for the price of $500.00.  The bags are very small and fill up fast, and also cost $7.00 for 5 bags.  It is extremely difficult to snap and unsnap the connections of this vacuum.  Took several people to hold it to unassemble when we returned the item.  The power nozzle shorted out several times on me , I think it may have to do with the fact that it is so difficult to snap and unsnap the utensils on this vacuum.  I have owned an electrolux for over 30 years, it has been a name brand in our home for over 70 years - I will not buy another electrolux vacuum - I will repair my trusty older model or switch brands.

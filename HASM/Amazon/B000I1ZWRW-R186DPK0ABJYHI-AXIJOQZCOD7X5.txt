Title: Canon Digital Rebel xTi review
Content:
The product performs as advertized.  It is more camera than the average user needs but has completely automated features for those who don't want to know the ins and outs of professional photography to take quality photos.  I highly recommend.  Choose the lenses that fit your requirements and you will be "good to go".

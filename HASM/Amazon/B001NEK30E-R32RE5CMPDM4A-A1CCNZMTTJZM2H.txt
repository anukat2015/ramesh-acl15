Title: Wait for a price reduction by Amazon
Content:
I purchased this computer for $749.95 on April 16, 2009.  I received this computer on April 22, 2009.  I came across the Amazon page for this computer on April 26, 2009 while searching Amazon for an upgrade, only to find that the price had been reduced to $714.38 a difference of $35.57.  I called Amazon Customer service in order to get a credit for the $35.57, only to learn that, as of September 2008, Amazon no longer honors price matching, even on their own prices.  A customer service supervisor insisted that there was nothing he could do and that I could absolutely not get a credit.  This situation will affect how I regard Amazon for my future purchases.  I think it is unfair that Amazon did not notify me that they no longer honor price matching.  In the future I will pay more somewhere else that does honor price matching in order to have that protection.

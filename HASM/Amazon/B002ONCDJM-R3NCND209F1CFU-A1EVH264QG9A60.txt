Title: Goodbye, Apple! Looks like HP G60-533CL at Costo
Content:
After a more than 5 year hiatus spend in the Apple camp, I'm back to a PC. I've had 3 Apples in that time and am a heavy user - daily, work, part-time professor and graduate student. Apple's couldn't stand up to my heavy, daily use. Period. The last straw was the screen on my 17" going bad, and Apple not covering it under AppleCare. 
Having gone OUT OF MY WAY for 5 years to use Apple i.e., buying Parallels to run QuickBooks (QB for Mac is a hassle for most accountants, so they require QB for PCs), I've decided to put Apple on the shelf. They are over-priced, of no better build quality (Made in China), and are more hassle to use than they're benefit.
I found the HP to be of good build quality, Windows 7 looks good (much better than XP), and the HP screen is beautiful. I like the 10-key number layout on the keyboard as well. Although I never had Vista, Windows 7 didn't appear loaded with bloatware. I replaced Norton with AVG and may remove some games and junk at a later time.
I paid $599 + tax for this machine at Costco, valuing the premium price paid for Costco's fabulous warranty and return policy.

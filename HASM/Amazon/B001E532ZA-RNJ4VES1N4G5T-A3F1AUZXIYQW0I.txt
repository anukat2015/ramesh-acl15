Title: Enjoy the Cappuccino and the Latte
Content:
I have the original version - the older model and have enjoyed the coffee for many years.  My only complaint would be the noise and only being able to use a smaller coffee cup.  I have a favorite medium sized cup which is too large for the machine.  I buy my coffee from Target and Bed & Bath.  I also take this machine when we go camping to an electrical site.  I am interested in the new version but will wait until my older one no longer works.

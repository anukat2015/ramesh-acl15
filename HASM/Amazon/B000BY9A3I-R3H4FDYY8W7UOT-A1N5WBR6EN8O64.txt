Title: cute sporty vacuum
Content:
Size is wonderful, suction is fantastic, the hose is super flexible and that is fantastic. However, the attachments  always fall of when I put them in " their " spot of rest . The rug attachment works ok, I recommend cleaning it out right away, a lot of hair can get caught up in it. The filter needs to be cleaned out often. ALL in ALL I do like it. Would I have bought a better one YES :) Why ! because I am a clean freak . HAPPY CLEANING :)

Title: Pretty awesome.
Content:
I've ranked the attributes as such and I think this thing scores really well on all fronts except two.
1. Ease of use - the menu system is far from perfect. It's not unusable or buggy, just not well thought out in my opinion. 
2. Battery life - 10 hours is a bit on the low side. My Creative Zen Stone used to go almost 20 when new, if I remember right.
On all other fronts this thing is pretty awesome. Sound quality is great and so is build quality. I like the size, the screen is properly readable (if a little fingerprint attractive) and the clip is handy. I wish it had a better arm band available for it, but I can manage. Also, I'm loving the FLAC support - with good headphones you can really tell the difference.

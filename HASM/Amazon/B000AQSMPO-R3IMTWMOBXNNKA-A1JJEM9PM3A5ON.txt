Title: Keurig B60
Content:
The Keurig B60 is a great product.  There is a vast selection of various coffees, teas and hot chocolate available.  It is probably a little more expensive to use the K-cups than bulk coffee, but once you have experienced the ease and convenience, you will no why.  The only down side would be the noisy pump.  I am already used to that.

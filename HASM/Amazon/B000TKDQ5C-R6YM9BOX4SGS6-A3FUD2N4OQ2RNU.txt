Title: Great product!!
Content:
This is a great little heater. My room is in the basement and it does get very cold here in the Northwest. I purchased this heater after my old one quit working. Was a little concerned about this one being so small but it definitely does the job. Keeps it very warm and heats the room quickly. Only draw back is it does not have a safety feature, will not turn off if tipped over. Thermostat works great, would definitely purchase again.

Title: Nice feature set - when it works
Content:
Great feature set for the price. Battery life is as advertised. Screen is bright, clear. Great product - if it works.
Mine came out of the box with a bootup problem - 8 times out of 10 it won't actually start up. The lights blink, the hard drive starts to spin up but then it just stops with a blank screen. Have to power it down and try again. Eventually it will boot up. Unfortunately Asus's only recourse for me is to ship it back and be without a laptop for more than a week while they try to fix it. As this is my only portable device for work that's a no win situation.

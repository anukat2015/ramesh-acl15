Title: At last, a coffee maker we LIKE!
Content:
We were heartily sick of the dribble pots that seem to be unavoidable with heating-element coffee makers. Okay, if you pour slowly enough they don't dribble, but who can pour 10 cups of water slowly before they've had a cup of coffee in the morning?
Hating the taste of endlessly heated coffee, we were decanting into carafes anyway, so we decided on this style and trusted in the many rave user reviews. We and they were right! For the many reasons listed by other reviewers, this is a great coffee maker.
It seems to us that Zojirushi has fixed the problems that buyers were complaining of three years ago. The only thing I would change on this would be making the dot on the lid (the "open" indicator) a bit easier to see. My aging and still-sleepy eyes have trouble detecting it.

Title: You get what you pay for...
Content:
Pros:
It came with Windows 7 and not Vista. (The lesser of two evils.)
Good price for the machines specs.
Touch pad disable button.
HDMI out.
Volume buttons.
Number pad if you use it. (If it recognizes all the keys you type...)
Annoyances:(NOT cons)
Touch pad sensitivity w/multi-touch enabled (Easily disabled.)
Touch pad position. (I understand lining it up with the space bar but I would rather it centered to the laptop itself.) 
Glossy screen allowing a lot of glare in bright places.
The top of the laptop collects finger prints easily.
Bloat ware. (Easily removed.)
Laptop doesn't enable sound through the HDMI cable when a HDMI cable is plugged in sometimes.
Cons:
Acer support.
The keyboard sucks. Misses a lot of letters while typing.
Does tend to get pretty hot if ran for a long time on a table or lap.
Power cord brick gets considerably warm compared to my old Acer power cord brick.
Sound gets messed up if the computer runs for a long time. (It might be my codecs or Windows. I haven't figured out what causes it yet.)

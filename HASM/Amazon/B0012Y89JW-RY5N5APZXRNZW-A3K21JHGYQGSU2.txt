Title: Great Little Camera
Content:
This is a fine little camera: light, compact, and easy to carry around.  I own a Canon 1D Mk II, but it is too big and heavy to carry when I am out trekking.  Fitted with better lenses than the kit lens, the Xsi has become my favorite camera.  I recommend purchasing the body only, and buying better lenses.

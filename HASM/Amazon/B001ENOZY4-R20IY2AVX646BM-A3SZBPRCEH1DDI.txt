Title: Great Camera
Content:
This camera is simply amazing. I have had it for about a week now and I just love it. It's very responsive, great AF with included lens, VR is a must and it performs surprisingly good. I have been waiting for this camera for the past 9 months or so and I'll tell you I'm glad I waited all this time. Another plus is a movie capture (here is a link to a video I posted on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32nbuy3OcLc ) it also is very good, but the only downside is it's manual focus. Over all very good camera and the included lens is also amazingly good.

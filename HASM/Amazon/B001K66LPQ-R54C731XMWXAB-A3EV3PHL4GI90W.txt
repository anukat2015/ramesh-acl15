Title: Brewstation number 2
Content:
This is my second Brewstation. I am very happy with this product. It brews a great cup of coffee. And this model has some extra features my first one did not. I am able to set the brew strength for 1 to 4 cups or up to 12 cups. I also can set the keep warm selector for 1,2,or 3 hours, thats a great feature because on work days I only need a one hour keep warm, and if I forget to turn the pot off before I leave, within minutes the pot shuts off automatically.
I would say if your looking for a decent coffee maker, look no farther. This one is great.

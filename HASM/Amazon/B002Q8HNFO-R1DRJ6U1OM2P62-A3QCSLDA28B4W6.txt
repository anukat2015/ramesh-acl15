Title: A Top Purchase IMHO
Content:
I've owned this computer for a little over 4 months and have very little to complain about. i will say this is my first laptop.i wanted a mac but just didn't have the extra 1000 and didn't feel like financing a luxury item.Most everything is great. it starts up extremely fast, the display is great, battery life is above average considering the specs and coming from Vista... Windows 7 is amazing. one thing that people should realize about this computer is it has a one-year accidental warranty which i think is worth at least an extra $50-$100. the only complaint(s) i have are; i continue to pop open the cd/dvd drive accidentally, the speaker isn't great-it's clear but not loud- and i continue to hit the cap locks key while typing. none of these things prevented me from loving the computer but all are worth noting. i paid under 600 and considered it a steal based on my comparisons.

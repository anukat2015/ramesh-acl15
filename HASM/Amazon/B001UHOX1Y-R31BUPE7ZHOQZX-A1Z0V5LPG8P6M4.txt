Title: Windows 7 makes this shine!
Content:
If you've been put off by the heat and battery life issues reported by some reviewers, let me say that these completely disappear under Windows 7.  I noticed the fan blowing hot air out of the side vent shortly after booting into Windows Vista for the first time but after installing Windows 7 and upgrading the BIOS, the DV2 runs cool and quiet.  With CPU undervolting - Google is your friend - the 6 cell battery will provide four hours of constant use with the 'Power Saver' energy profile; something my old MSI Wind u100 could barely manage.
Netbook or notebook?  Whatever you call it, the HP DV2-1030us is a stylish and capable ultraportable computer, well-suited for home and business use.

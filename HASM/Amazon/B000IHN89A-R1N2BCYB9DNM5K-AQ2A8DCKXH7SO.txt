Title: Well worth the price, a better flash would earn 5 stars.

I've been upgrading my compact Digital Camera's nearly every year, trying to get a very good and portable camera to take on hiking and kayaking trips figuring if it where to be damaged I'd only be out a few hundred bucks.  Even my latest and greatest 5.2 Megapixel does not take the quality of photo I'm looking for.  After reading the Specs and Reviews on the K-10 and it's weather/dust ristance I decided it was time to move up.  Though $400 more than my last compact this camera has proven to be well worth it's price.  Not having to worry about a few rain drops, or the occasional dust devil has emboldened me to get outdoor shots no matter what the weather.  This camera is very solid, and fast, just flick the "on" switch and start snapping shots.

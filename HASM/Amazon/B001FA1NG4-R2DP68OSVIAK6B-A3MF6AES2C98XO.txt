Title: Love It!!!!!!!
Content:
I LOVE my ipod!  I had the 2nd generation nano and when it started wearing out the new ones had just come out.  I had originally looked at the apple web site to order but it was such a hassle.  Luckily I came to amazon and got it.  With shipping and handling it was still $20 cheaper here.  I am so happy with the service and the ipod.  I can't say enough good things. LOVE IT!

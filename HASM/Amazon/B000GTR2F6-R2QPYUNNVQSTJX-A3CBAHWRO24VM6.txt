Title: B70 Unintended Review
Content:
This review is titled unintended not due to a bad thing but a miss ship. I actually ordered the B60 but was accidentally shipped the B70. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, (yes, I contacted the company but that is in another review). On the plus side the extra cup size (11.25oz) turned out to be perfect for a normal size travel mug. If I got the B60, I would have to run two different sizes to fill my cup(my wife still has to run two brews for her mug but I don't think any machine could fill that keg of hers.) Very convenient single cup system with good coffee. As far as the coffee being watered down, it was about right for me. It all depends on your tastes. I found you really have to run one tank of water first to flush out the system prior to your first cup or it will taste funny (ok I was in a rush to try out my new toy :-) ) My only minor complaint is like other people said, it can be noisy but only for a few seconds while it is filling. I find it a little funny to watch the water shake in the blue led light so it really doesn't bother me but it might bother some other people. A great product for that morning cup of coffee prior to work.

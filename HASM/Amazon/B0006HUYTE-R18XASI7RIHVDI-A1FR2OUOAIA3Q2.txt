Title: Good choice!
Content:
This is a great little vac!  I'd had a beat up canister for years, and needed something new, but I had no idea I'd be getting something this nice for this price.
I use it on bare floor and carpet, and the suction was so strong that I had to open the vent on the handle...it lifted up one of my throw rugs. It worked well on cat hair, and I'm really pleased  with it overall. It's a little noisy, and the cord wrap-up is not so great, but I do like it a lot.

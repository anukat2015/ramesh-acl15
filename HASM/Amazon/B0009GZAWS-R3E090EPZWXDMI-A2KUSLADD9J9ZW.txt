Title: Impressive D-SLR
Content:
Like most of the D50 potential buyers, I've been comparing it with the Rebel XT. From reviews to pro photographers: both cameras are great and you can't go wrong with neither of them. Recommendations were mostly: play with both and see which one feels better in your hand.
And so I did and purchased both at Costco (great return policy). At the end I kep the D50.
The D50 provides a better feel and professional handling than the Rebel XT, for my taste of course.
A deal-breaker was the lack of out-of-box RAW support, thus the comments from another reviewer, "L. Tao "techfreak" (thanks BTW, very useful info). But now, that Adobe RAW 3.2 is out, I'm happy to report that the white balance is proplery 'decoded' and appears as captured by the CCD.
So far, I'm so happy with the D50 and don't regret not going for the rebel XT. From the focus system (with the default kit lens), to the color reproduction, to exceptional low-light shooting, and continous shooting, the D50 is very very impressive.
Sure the Rebel XT packs more pixels and it is a terrific D-SLR; but its feel and build quality left something to be desired, not to mention that the flash must be used for AF illuminator and that some settings are simply shortcut to the menus. The D50 just has an excepional handling, great build quality, and adjustments don't require to navigate thru menus.

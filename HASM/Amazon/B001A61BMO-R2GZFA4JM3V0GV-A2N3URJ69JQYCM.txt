Title: company doesn't have it together
Content:
It was an OK machine. The coffee was good. It made a lot of noise and a tremendous amount of steam. One day I tapped the carafe against the sink faucet while filling it and it shattered. Very thin glass in my opinion. When I attempted to order a replacement carafe i was told it would be three months to get one. Yikes!

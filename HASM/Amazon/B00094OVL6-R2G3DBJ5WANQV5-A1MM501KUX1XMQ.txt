Title: almost perfect
Content:
I've had this for about a month. I love everything about it except that the coffee is not hot enough. Mr Coffee machines are hot enough (just to give an idea of what I think is hot enough). I love the size and I love how the part where you put the water in drains completely and no leftover steam water, so it's always clean and dry -- unlike all other machines I've tried which all scummed up after time and it was hard to clean in there. For some reason, the pot doesn't get hard water spots like all my other pots did. Sure wish it was hotter. . .

Title: Good But Not Great
Content:
I so wanted to really like this coffee maker, but alas, that was not to be.
Pros:
The coffee is really HOT
Timer and programmable automatic shut off are really nice
Looks great on my counter
Cons:
Coffee brews waaay too fast.  If you are brewing just 1 or 2 cups, the coffee comes out weak.  I use a paper filter and the included gold filter, which helps some.  Bottomline, a slow brew feature would have been nice.
Occasionally the basket doesn't swing open as it should.  9 times out of 10, it works fine.  Every once in awhile you have to give it a nudge.  Not a huge deal, but thought I'd mention it.
I still give this 4 stars, because it does function well and nicely designed.  If only it had a slow brew option, I'd give it 5 stars.  I like my coffee really strong, so this might not be a problem for most people.

Title: Yeah, this is it!
Content:
Been in photography over 50 years, with about all formats.  When I decided to go digital SLR, read every review of every camera by major makers.  This one came through better than all the rest, on paper.  I bought it.  Performs flawlessly, great pictures, (main thing-that's what cameras are for!) easy for the beginner to use, and allows the user to grow into it.  In the meantime you get super images. Seriously, 6 mp is all you need when produced by this jewel.  It is a fine camera.  Highly recommend.

Title: If it leaks, why would you buy it???
Content:
I had one of these units and it ended up it the trash after 18 months of use.  
Mine leaked all over the floor and carpet.
Since these units are prone to leakage, why would anyone buy it?  
Replacing carpets and wood is an expensive proposition, perhaps far more than the unit costs.
Forget service.  No one services these units.

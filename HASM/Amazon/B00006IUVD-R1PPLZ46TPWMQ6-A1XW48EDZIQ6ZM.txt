Title: New but not improved
Content:
This item was purchased to replace an earlier version of the Brew 'N Go Coffemaker that we had for about a dozen years. The major flaw in the newer version is the poor design of the reservoir that holds the water. It is almost impossible to fill it without water ending up on the counter. The target is too narrow when poured from a typical coffee mug.
Once this is overcome, no problems brewing a decent cup of coffee.

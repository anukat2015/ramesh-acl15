Title: Ipod Died
Content:
I purchased an Ipod 20GB for my wife for her birthday at Best Buy. The whole time I was looking at the item the salesman qept talking about exteded service warranty. He stated that he recomended them because they do get some Ipods returned within a year with bad batteries. I figured this was a sales pitch and bought mine with out the extra warrnty. To make a lon story short, the Ipod died within the first week we had it. Just prior to it dying the battery charge indicator showed the battery nearly full. What ever the cause, all repairs unless under warranty are very pricy!! Buy with caution!!!!! We returned ours for a refund.

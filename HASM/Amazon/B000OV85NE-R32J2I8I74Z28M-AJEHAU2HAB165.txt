Title: umm, how does this work?
Content:
Heard all these fabulous reviews but right from the start I couldn't get the battery cover off.After 3 different days of trying I finally got it off, but now I can get it to stay back on. Never before having used an MP3 player I can't seem to download any music onto the thing. Someone's coming this weekend so maybe they can help- if not... I don't know. Will let you know.

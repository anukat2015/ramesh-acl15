Title: Cheaper than an iPod.
Content:
That's pretty much all that needs to be said. For a fraction of the cost you get all the same features, a lot more PC-friendliness (such as the ability to play .wma and .wav files) and although it is slightly bulkier than a nano it slips easily into a pocket.
If you really care about designer labels then go get an iPod, but if you'd rather use your money on the things that make life fun then this is the Mp3 player for you. And you get an FM radio built it, so if you ever get bored of the 2Gb f music you have with you then you can search the airwaves for something new.

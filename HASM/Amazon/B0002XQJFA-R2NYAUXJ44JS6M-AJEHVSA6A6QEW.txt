Title: Excelent camera and price
Content:
I have spent a long time considering the purchase of a SLR digital camera to upgrade from my old EOS 35mm.  I was set to purchase the 10D for christmas this year but my oh my was I glad the 20D came out, it is faster, quieter, and has 8.2 mp insted of the 6.x mp in the 10D.  
The 10D is a great camera and the 20D is only better, the start up takes about 1/200 of a second so you probably won't even notice it, you can shoot repeating photos as fast as the flash will allow (depending on the media card of course) but the system is quick and takes great photos.
The lens that comes with the set is, well, not the greatest, but for costing basicly nothing over the body alone it is a good add on and will shoot some good pictures for you.  If your looking to do professional work I'd get a better lens (or purchase the professional EOS digital and professional lens).  For the rest of us Sigma has always made great EOS lens.
If you are looking to buy a high quality digital camera this is the one for you, if you want a cheaper camera that is still excelent check out the rebel.

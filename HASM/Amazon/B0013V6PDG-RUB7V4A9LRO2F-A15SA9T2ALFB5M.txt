Title: Toasty Toes Indeed
Content:
This heated footrest has saved me from the horror of frozen toes.  It's made of sturdy plastic and the lower of the two settings provides more than enough warmth.  The only downside is that it's easy to leave switched on and turning it on and off involves some grovelling around under the desk.  Happily both these problems are solved by adding a Intermatic TB121C Digital Tabletop Lamp and Appliance Timer which both allows you to set a couple of daily "off" times (so the footrest is never left on for more than a few hours) and also provides a desktop on/off switch.

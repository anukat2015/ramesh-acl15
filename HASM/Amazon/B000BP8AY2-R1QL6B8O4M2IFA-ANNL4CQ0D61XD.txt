Title: Long lifetime
Content:
I have to say, this product doesn't appear half as glamorous as the Ipod or another high end MP3 gadget, but it works.
Ok, granted, having to buy a gazillion AAA batteries over the years makes me wonder if the batteries themselves end up costing more than the thing itself, but after 3.5 years and its still working, I'm darn impressed by it.
If all you want is a steady music player that won't break on you even if you drop it about 100 times, this is the one.

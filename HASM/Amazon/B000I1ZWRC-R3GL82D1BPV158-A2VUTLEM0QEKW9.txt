Title: I'm taking pictures
Content:
All I can really say about this camera, WOW! I'm the guy to see for all of your photo needs. Since I've had this camera, I've been everywhere. The list is to long, but I've been there. When I show up with this camera I'm asked to take the pictures. I'm loving it! I get to meet so many people. Since I've had this camera I see things all around me now differently. What a wonderful camera. It's so easy to use and I'm having a lot of fun leaning how to use all of the great things it has to offer. Family and friends say; I'm good. I'm not! It's the camera. It's the camera! Also, it came with a lot of good deals. I'm using them all. Great, great camera. I'm creating a photographic memory thanks to this camera.

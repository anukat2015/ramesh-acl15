Title: Fantastic space heater!
Content:
My wife and I purchased this to help keep our Boston area apartment warm and less drafty. We are nothing short of impressed to the point it has become a part of our normal everyday lingo and we are considering whether we want a second one! This heater does a nice job even on very large spaces (roughly 7-800 sq feet, main living area) as long as its not under 45 outside or so (without even running our very inefficient electric furnace) and in bedrooms it is the only heat source you'll need - regardless of outside temperature. It is easy to use and we really like how it adjusts its own output once the room temperature is stablized. It is also very easy to move from room to room as there is a molded, built-in handle, it has a relatively long cord allowing for easy placement, and yes, it really is QUIET (we couldn't believe it at first)! Go to the vornado website and read about the company - you'll be impressed with this US-made space heater!

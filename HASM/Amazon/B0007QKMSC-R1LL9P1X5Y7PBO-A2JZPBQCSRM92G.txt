Title: Finally
Content:
I owned a canon rebel film loading camera for years and my pictures were always perfect. When everyone went digital I could not afford the digital canon rebel (4 year ago cost $1,200!!) so I purchased MANY many small digital camera around $300 and I kept getting bad picture, after bad picture and was very disappointed in the picture quality by digital cameras. I bought a return about 7 digital cameras 
The only digital camera that came close to my film load rebel quality was canon sd600 elph but even with that some picture would be hazey in very dark rooms, and lots and lots of red!!
When I saw the digital rebel came down on price to $450 on Amazon, I bought one and every picture I have taken has come out prefect with the digital rebel!! I was able to attach my old flash and old lens (from my film loader rebel) onto the new digital rebel and all my picture are prefect again, no more red eye!!! 
The canon elph is great for your pocket if your going on bike ride or hikes it does take a good picture; the digital rebel is a little too big to stick in your purse. But for family pictures at home in low light rooms the rebel makes you feel like a professional photographer because the picture comes out PERFECT every time (with the right lens & flash attached). 
I will not be buying another camera again ever unless this one break which I dought will happen because I've had my film loading rebel for 10 years now and it still works!! You will not be disppointed with this camera

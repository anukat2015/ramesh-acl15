Title: LOVE my new Nikon D-SLR!!
Content:
First, I have to say that I am an amateur photographer - just love taking pics of my kids, family and nice scenes.  I don't need a lot of extras ... but have always been disappointed by slow shutter speed and, ultimately, missing "the" moment.  (Espcially with kids!!)  But I don't have that problem with this camera!  Its fast, accurate, takes GREAT pics and I'm thrilled with the "guide" (very helpful!).  As far as the purchase, the price was excellent and came with many extras (carry case, lens cleaner, extra battery, memory card ... and much more!)  I'm very impressed and couldn't give this purchase a higher recommendation!

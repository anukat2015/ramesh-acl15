Title: Great performer for 4 years
Content:
I've had this vacuum for 4 years now.  No problems. Used twice a week (Thanks to my "shed-master" cats...  Still cleans as well as the day I bought it.  Excellent on tile, hardwood, as well as deep pile carpet.  No significant brush wear.  Never replaced the belt or the filter, but I do clean the latter carefully.  Great buy!

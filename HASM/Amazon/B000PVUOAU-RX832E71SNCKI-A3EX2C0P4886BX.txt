Title: Different model but some input for your consideration
Content:
I actually got mine at Home Depot too.  The model I bought was the PH4-13R-01.  It has 13000 Btu cooling power and 12000 Btu heat pump.  It looks identical to this one pictured at Amazon.  I saved a hundred dollars by signing up for a HD credit card - so it made the decision to buy somewhat easier.
Good:
Cools well, mine is rated at 550sf, but I am actually trying to cool a much larger area.  Good for a large living room or family room with kitchen adjacent.  It is possible to super cool the area if necessary.  
Control layout is easy to understand and change settings.
3 fan speeds, allows good control of air speed.
The heat pump is a big deal, I can't wait to try it out.  Heat pumps are basically air conditioning cycle in reverse - it's supposed to be way more efficient than a typical furnace.
Bad:
Oscillation (sp?) is only up and down, not side to side.  Makes air distribution poor to corners of room.
Uses lots of power, I think 1300 watts - but still better than my central air.  You can save some electricity by setting the thermostat a bit higher - the compressor will turn on/off as needed to maintain that temp.

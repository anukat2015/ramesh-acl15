Title: Disappointing...
Content:
Desperate for counter space, I bought this unit in spite of the reviews.  I'd had a Mr. Coffee under the cabinet coffee maker for 15 years and wanted to update my kitchen(and I wanted 'brew stop').  Too bad B&D doesn't have any competition, otherwise they'd pay attention to reviews of their under cabinet models that have been fairly negative for years.  So here's my very recent experience:
-Difficult to install, even for very experienced handyman/contractor husband
-What's up with back-lit cup area on reservoir, but no back light on clock?
-Had to hold carafe into filter spring until it started to fill about 1/4 full, or the coffee would just dribble into carafe
-So difficult to fill reservoir, unless you take lid off and use carafe to fill it, making it more steps to fill than necessary
-Non-removable lid makes it hard to clean carafe
-Hot plate did not keep the coffee hot
-Unit simply quit working after only two weeks
-The only really good thing has been the excellent and speedy customer service from Applica, who replaced my unit within two weeks(they did charge me a nominal $8 shippin/handling fee, though), only had to send them the cut plug from the non-working unit.
-New unit does makes good coffee, I love the space-saving feature, and it looks pretty decent..........I see they now have an under cabinet model with a thermal carafe.
I hope the B&D people pay serious attention to the customer reviews and try to make a quality product.  I know that I would be thrilled to pay a little more if I knew the product was going to last 10 years.  I've had appliances that have lasted 15-20 years, and they have not been designed to fail...

Title: excellent entry-level DSLR
Content:
Exactly what I expected. Fantastic photos, easy to use, good quality.
Using live view mode will take up to 5 seconds for focusing, so most of the people will continue to use viewfinder.
Video mode is just decent and you cannot record using viewfinder, just using the screen, which will drain your battery. Movies are limited to 20 minutes, which is fair enough, but nobody likes to be limited.

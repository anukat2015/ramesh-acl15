Title: Canon Rebel Xti
Content:
I love the ease and quality of this camera. I am point and shoot user who felt very limited by the its capabilities.  With the Xti, I have that point and shoot option as well as the ability to take other types of shots.  The sport mode is great for taking fast motion picutres at my daughter's softball games.  The standard lens is great for everyday pictures, but if you desire good closeups when you can't be on top of your subject,it would be wise to upgrade your lens to one with a longer range.  It is hard to take a bad shot with this camera. A great camera for the money.

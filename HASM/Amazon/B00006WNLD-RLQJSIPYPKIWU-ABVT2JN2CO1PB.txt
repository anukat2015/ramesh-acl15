Title: The best coffee maker ever.
Content:
We have had this coffee maker in our home so long it should be replaced just because it looks old - day after day, average of 7 cups a day, this machine just keeps on going - if u need a one cup at a time coffee maker I highly recomend looking into this one - I dont think it can be beat.

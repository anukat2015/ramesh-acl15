Title: Perfect 4 the babies room!
Content:
LOVE IT! This is great!  The tempature control lets me know that it shuts off and turns on.  I can point the fan in any direction.  Warms a small room quickly.  the low fan setting is quite. The thermo/ temp setting is a lil off!  It does the trick! My babies room is over the garage soo it is much cooler than the rest of house!  This lil Heater was inexpensive and money well spent!

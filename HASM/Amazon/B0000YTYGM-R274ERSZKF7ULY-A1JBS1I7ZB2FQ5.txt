Title: Love it!
Content:
I read all the reviews here before I bought this. After having it 6 weeks and using it almost every day, I can say we love this coffeemaker! Yes, it has a beep to tell you it's finished brewing (5 beeps, to be precise). However, we can't hear it upstairs at all, and just barely from our living room (adjacent to the kitchen). It's just not that big a deal for us. It has NEVER leaked, and the thermal carafe is the best one I've ever owned in that it keeps the coffee HOT and fresh for hours. You do need to get the knack of putting the lid on correctly, but again, that's just not a big deal for us. All in all, I would buy this again in a heartbeat.

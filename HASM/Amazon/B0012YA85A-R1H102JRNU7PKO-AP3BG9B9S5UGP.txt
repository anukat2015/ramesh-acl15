Title: Hi-Res Pictures!
Content:
I have had Canon products for years and had a 35mm Canon SLR, this was the main reason to stick with Canon as I was able to use my old lenses with this digital SLR camera. I have had several point-and-shoot camera's which only lasted a year or two... cheap to buy and cheaply made... you get what you pay for.
This Camera has all the options you could need in a digital SLR camera at a great price, easy to use and awesome picture quality. I am experimenting with the manual settings but the auto settings take great quality pictures as well. Many professional photographers agree Canon is the leader in lenses. 
Pros - Hi Res pictures, easy to use and a great price for a digital SLR.
Cons - In "Live view" auto focas is not available. (This is the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star!)

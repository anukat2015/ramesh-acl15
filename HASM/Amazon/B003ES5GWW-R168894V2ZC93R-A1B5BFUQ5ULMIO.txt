music player
--------------
-sound is improved
-more features
-better features
-hd radio
video (organic led)
--------------
-just imagine a portable led tv in ur pocket (for those who don't know organic led is the next level in telvision sets already out sony has one)
-hd video up to 720.
-no improvement in resolution, but the organic screen makes up for plus has hd playback
apps
--------------
still new so very limited, just give time to get going. expect what apple has.
other
--------------
-better material then previous model
-flash memory (better for active people, running etc). wont mess up like previous models that contain hard drive.
-touch is very responsive.
-has virtually all features that itouch has.
-multi-touch
over all it really exceed my expectations. plus its expected to bring equivlent gaming experience as itouch(if you dont know microsoft creatur of zune also created the gaming console XBox and Xbox 360). i know i missing something, but its a great portable media player

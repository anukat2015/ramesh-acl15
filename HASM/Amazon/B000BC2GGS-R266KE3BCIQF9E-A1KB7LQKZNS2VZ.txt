Title: good and bad -- be careful
Content:
I've had one of these heaters for a couple years and it has worked well for occasional use & I've been quite happy with it.  So, last week when I saw them for sale at Home Depot I picked another one up.  I used it for a couple days, turning it on during the day and off at night.  Then one morning I went to turn it on and was surprised to find the unit was hot.  Even though it was powered off and the display was off the unit was still heating.  I unplugged it and tried again later with the same result.  I don't know if this a common problem, but you may want to make sure yours is working OK. 
Thankfully I was able to return the defective heater to the store I bought it.  But my experience with this heater and a previous experience with defective Honeywell humidifiers makes me wonder if Honeywell's quality no longer lives up to their reputation.  And their support company, Kaz, leaves very much to be desired in regard to customer service.
If I had no concerns about the safety and reliability of this heater, I would give it 5 stars, but unfortunately that is not the case.

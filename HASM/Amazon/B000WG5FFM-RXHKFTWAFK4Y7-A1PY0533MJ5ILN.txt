Title: Very Impressed
Content:
I got a Zune for Christmas. I have been an avid iPod user for many years. I wanted to switch to the Zune because I got tired of iTunes. The Zune is very small and lightweight. It is the size of a credit card so it makes it convenient to just throw in my purse or use at the gym. I like the fact that it has an FM radio because I can listen to NPR in the mornings. It's design is very impressive and I like the Zune interface. Overall I am very satisfied and will recommend the Zune to anyone. It is a great alternative to the iPod nano.

Title: Fantastic
Content:
This vacuum was bought to replace one from Sears that broke after three weeks.  Sears gave me attitude about replacing theirs so I just got my money back and bought this Hoover.  It is $95 cheaper and works much better. 
I am a slob and I only vacuum once a week during a good month.  I've two cats who I am amazed are not completely bald with all the hair they shed.  This thing works wonders on cat hair (and the occasional overlooked hairball under the coffee table). 
I am a crumudgeon as well as a cheap SOB and I like the thing.  I even emailed Hoover to tell them so.  I don't like much but this thing is great even if I have to empty the dirt container twice when I vacuum the whole house - that's not Hoovers fault it is the cats. 
It is a funny looking thing but it works like a charm.

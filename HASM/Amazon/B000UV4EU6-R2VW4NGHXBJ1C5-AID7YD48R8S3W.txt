Title: A solid video mp3 choice
Content:
The Zen vision is an excellent alternative to the current generation ipod nano. It matches or surpasses the features of the nano and is a functional device. It does however have a few problems.
The video player supports more formats than the nano, including divx to watch your favorite tv shows and the like. The startling problem with the video playback is that it cannot downsize larger videos to fit the screen. If they are too big, it just refuses to play them. Luckily the conversion software works well, but it's still a big let down.
The SD card slot is something you will want to use specifically for videos and other media that you arn't relying on listening to back to back with the rest of your library. Since any songs you put on the card will not be integrated into your library for things like play all.
The FM radio is a bit weak, but it picks up the stronger stations in the area without a problem. And it's certainly better than the nano's lack of the option.
IMPORTANT: If you have itunes, you will still need to stick with your ipod and other apple products. Itunes is very specifically made to force you to buy their apple products and your protected itunes music will not play on the zen or other players.
Overall it's the best choice in it's class due to it's lower price and abundant features. It isn't the strongest video player out there due to the requirement of converting larger videos (higher resolution), but it's an excellent mp3 player.

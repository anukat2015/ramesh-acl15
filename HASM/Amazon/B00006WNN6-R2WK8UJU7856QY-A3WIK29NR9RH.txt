Title: you get what you pay for
Content:
I used to own this heater--until it just up and died on me one day.  It was fine while it worked.  I was using it to keep warm in my office.  It only heats a tiny space at a time, so it didn't even keep my entire office warm--only about a 2 foot radius of where I placed it.  I worked only for one season and then stopped working one day.

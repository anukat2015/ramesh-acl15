Title: Sleek looking... but loud, inefficent and inaccurate.
Content:
I bought this heater last from Bed, Bath and Beyond - and I will be returning it tonight. Initially the heater looks very sleek and nice. Though, the performance on the other hand served poorly (and I live in Los Angeles). The heater for me was too loud, did not heat up my room very well, and even when I could feel the room get cooler or hotter - the thermostat read the same temperature.

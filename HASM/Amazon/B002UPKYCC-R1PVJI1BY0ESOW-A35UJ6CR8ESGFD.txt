Title: Power and Speed, a laptop to replace your desktop
Content:
I needed a fast video editing machine with greater portability than the usual desktop.  The dv8t runs my copy of Pinnacle Studio 14 without straining.  The software makes full use of the high resolution wide screen.  There is no specific illusion of lighting speed because this quad core is smart enough to utilize its power only as and when necessary.  For this reason the laptop runs cool! In fact I am surprised at how little heat it puts out which is a good thing.  This baby is heavy but I expected that, I will not be choosing to carry it around on airplanes but when I need to take it with me on vacations I will not have to pack and unpack a full desktop system.  There is an optional video tuner which has a tiny cable adapter for hooking up cable TV (not tried yet).  I was pleased that HP does not force me to use the fingerprint reader although the HP software at times can be a little irritating reminding me more often than I desire to try out different features.  I treat this monster with great care and respect and will look for a "gun case" to store it in when I do travel. So far (after about two months - January 2010) I am thrilled.  It is a particular pleasure to boot up and put to use.

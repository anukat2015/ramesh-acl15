Title: Great heater, lousy thermostat
Content:
I've had this heater as the only heat source in my 10X15 ft. office through two Florida winters. It puts out plenty of heat on "low," and is so quiet that I don't know whether it's on or off without looking. The only problem, sadly a big one, is that the thermostat only sets in 5 degree increments and allows too much heat variation before it turns on, so I'm always a little too hot or too cold. I'm thinking of replacing it with one of the competing Lasko ceramic heaters. A friend has one, and it seems to be just as quiet and efficient as the Holmes, but does a better job of maintaining a stable temperature. I have waited and waited for Holmes to come out with a ceramic heater just like this one but with a better thermostat, but I guess this isn't going to happen. Oh, well.

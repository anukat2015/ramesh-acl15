Title: Not good as garage heater
Content:
The product quality was good, but it does not heat up garage/workshop area very well.  In order to feel heat you must be within 3 feet of heater.  I wanted to use to warm up workshop area prior to actually working in area and it just did not due the job.  The heater is good if you are right next to it, but don't count on it to heat up work area...especially if you live in a state like Wisconsin.

Title: WONDERFUL!
Content:
it was amazing to me that i see some poor reviews here on this little vacuum! - i bought one quite a few years ago when they first came out - use it on both carpet/tile/hardwood almost daily. after two years we had a lightning storm which "fried" almost everything plugged in (yes, i'd left it plugged in), including large appliances.
anyway, had to replace it then. that was about 3 yr.s ago - purchased another and love it just as much! i honestly would not trade this little jewel for another rainbow vac.
someone on a review mentioned it having little suction? this vacuum's suction is so powerful that i often need to turn it down!
i drag this little guy back and forth from my gift shop to the house....love it!

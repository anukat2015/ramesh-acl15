Title: Not a bad heater
Content:
I bought 2 of these.  I have one in the bedroom which is about 11 x 14 ft and one in my living room which is 21 x 12 but is open to my kitchen which is 17 x 9.  The one in the bedroom heats the room very nicely.  At times made it too warm so I set the thermostat at about 75 and put on the timer for a couple of hours which shuts off on its own.  The one in the living room takes awhile to heat the room (prob a good 2 hours of running continously before I notice that its getting warmer in there and then i set the stat and timer.  I keep my house thermostat at 62 (gas & forced hot air heat) and I must say my house is wood with aluminum siding and not very well insulated so these heaters do help especially the bedroom one.  It is helping me keep my house thermostat turned down which last winter I kept it at 68 but I have yet to see my electric bill.  I gave it 4 stars because it does heat the rooms.  I don't like how long the unit is (3 ft) and I don't like how the digital temp face plate doesn't light up so it makes it hard to see when I'm setting the temp and timer.  The only time it clicks slightly or makes any kind of sound is when it kicks on to keep up with the temperature I have set it at.  Otherwise, virtually no sound.  I'm basically pretty satisfied.  I would recommend if size and the faceplate not lighting up isn't an issue.

Title: Well Done, still needs little adjustments

The sony vaio P notebook is brilliant, My favorite thing about this notebook is the keypad, when I first looked at the laptop on the internet, it looked tiny and I was very worried since I am in college and I have many essays to type up. As soon as my notebook arrived I tried out the keypad and it was a perfect fit for my fingers however, the scroller implanted into the keypad is a little bit hard for me to control, I would strongly recommend something easier to command by. 
Now the software (windows vista) is brilliant, my parents have a mac and the software on there is boring, but with windows vista it is amazing . What i adore about the features on the software is the "Windows movie maker" it is awesome I love making home-made little videos of my dogs.  And also the search widget on the start program. It is more easier to look for things than just scrolling down and looking for things.
The model is quite cute and is easy to carry however i would suggest maybe a cd slot to watch movies.
here are my thoughts and I would strongly suggest you purchase this notebook .
thank-you

Title: Great for astrophotography
Content:
I love this camera.  With the Live View, all I do is hook it up to my laptop, and find a bright star, and magnify the view on the laptop and I can focus in seconds.  With the Xti and no Live View, it was a long, painful process that never really focused right.  Once focused, I can take several long exposure pictures with no problem.  Much less noise at higher ISO's than the Xti.  I was able to get great pictures, first night out.
For other uses, its a great camera as well!

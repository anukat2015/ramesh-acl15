Title: OUTSTANDING
Content:
I was an early adopter with this camera.  Don't laugh, but I sold my 5D Canon to buy this little guy.  I was headed towards the 5DMKII and had a moment of clarity: which camera will I be more apt to use?  The DMC-G1 hasn't disappointed.  It takes razor sharp photos and is a joy to use.  I'm an aerial photographer and just for fun, I took up a friend's Canon 5DMKII to compare to the little G1.  I was very suprised: both deliver equally crisp shots.  In some cases, the G1 delivered a sharper image, on the detail.  The fact that they were close blew me away, because the pixel count is very different in the two different formats.  The only weak point, if there is one, is that the controls on top tend to get bumped and changed when you're not looking, so it's always a good idea to confirm the settings.  I sold $5,000 worth of lenses and camera (5D) to get this camera and I'm very pleased that I made the move.

Title: Cheap and dangerous.
Content:
This could have been done better:
I'm not supposed to plug it in unless it has water in it ready to be heated. When I plugged it in the first time, sure enough the light came on and so if I didn't have water in it, it would have been "bad".
I bought it for my office so I can pout a cup of water in it, heat it, and make tea.
Well, when I took it to my office and plugged it in, it came on automatically again. So the manual warining you not to plug it in without having water in it seems valid.
I'm afraid to leave it plugged-in after it's off (what if power gets interrupted and it turns itself back on and burn the place down?).
So instead of simply putting water in, getting hot water out. I have to plug it in, put water, start it, get water out unplug it.
Why, why couldn't they put a hard switch on it (so it won't turn on unless you want it to). I bought it to make life simpler, not to wake up in the middle of the night worrying if I unplugged it and if my workplace has burned down...
I wouldn't buy it again.

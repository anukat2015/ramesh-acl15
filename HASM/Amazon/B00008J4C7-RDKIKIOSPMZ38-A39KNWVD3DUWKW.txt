Title: Shark, Roadster
Content:
I just bought the Shark Roadster today at Target, and boy was I impressed.  I have 3 cats, and one of them has been sneezing and I had some of the same problems too and I tried the Roadster today to clean 2 cat trees covered with carpet, besides the carpet and Furniture.  My suprise was when I opened up the HEPA filter compartment, and there was so much cat fuzz and carpet residue, and I emptied out and cleaned out the compartment, and then used it again in the bedroom, and I was able to get under the bed, on top of the bed, and the couch--the main areas of cat dander.  The TURBO BRUSHES did Exceedingly well, and they sound like a jet engine when started.
The only little problem I had was in Swiveling the hose around, as I cleaned.  I thought that maybe a polished stainless sleeve around the Brush attachment joints and at the Vacuum end, might make the rotation of the Hose a bit smoother.
All in all, I saw the Visible proof of this Vacuums Excellent Design, and I hope that you do not Alter too Much of your present design, because I would already--buy another Roadster Vacuum.  Please don't tamper too much with the present design, this vacuum does have 1 1/2 the times the Suction power as advertised.  I also wondered at the prospect of you ever using actual aluminum framework to replace the "Plastic Aluninium Finish", on the Framework, but that would probably drive the cost of the Vacuum up to $600.00 instead of $99.99.
I put the Shark Roadster to the Supreme Test, and it came out like a Champ--It's nice to see Good Engineering in a product.
Great Product at a fair price.

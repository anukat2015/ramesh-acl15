Title: LOVE THIS HEATER!!
Content:
It's AMAZING! I love it! I just bought this heater about two weeks ago, basing my decision strictly on the reviews.  I bought it to put in my cube at work. Fits perfectly on my desk and does not make any of my cubemates uncomfortable, which is always good. I love that is has the heater and fan available. It will turn off automatically so it doesn't overheat. I keep the heater or fan on ALL day from about 7:30AM to 5:30PM. No problems. Don't have any doubts! Buy it!!

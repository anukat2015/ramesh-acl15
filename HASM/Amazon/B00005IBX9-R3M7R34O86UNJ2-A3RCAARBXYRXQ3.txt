Title: Best coffee maker I've ever owned
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a gift from my husband. I've always bought cheap coffee makers ($20-$30.00) and they never seem to last more than a year or they just don't work properly ie: when you go to pour they leak all over the place! This coffee maker is absolutely worth the money, it is  a dream!It doesn't spill a drop of water when you pour which was a big thing for me, it's easy to work and looks great. 
I love how you can choose the temperature of your coffee, I never realized I could drink HOT coffee after pouring creamer in, it's quite impressive. For small pots it runs the coffee through twice so that its as hot as a full pot.
I love this coffee maker and can't imagine how people could have written bad reviews on it. Buy it, you won't be sorry.

Title: Quiet, small, low power requirement, perfect for our need
Content:
'They' turned down the thermostat at work and forbade space heaters due to their traditional power requirements (750-1500 watts).  When I saw that this only draws 300 watts, I wasn't sure if it would do the job.  It DOES do the job just fine.  It is a personal heater, not a space heater, and when placed under my cubicle desk pointed at my legs it warms me all over.  It has no built-in thermostat (on/off switch only) but I'm fine with that. I can type again without my hands hurting from the cold.

Title: Outstanding Spot Conditioner
Content:
I purchased this unit from Amazon to provide spot conditioning to my loft, as I've just cut the trees around the house and increased the heat load.  While I can't rate its utility as a stand-alone room unit, for my purpose it works well.
The unit is not too noisy, when operating as an AC, it has two fans and the compressor running, but it rates favourably with window units I've heard.  I question the 60 pints resevoir, the manual says removing the drain plug yields about 1.5 liters (12 pints) but who cares?  The water goes out the exhaust.  I did insulate the exhaust hose, as it gets pretty hot.
The remote control is outstanding.  All the functions appear on the remote, and there is an audible 'beep' from the unit that indicates that it recieved your instruction.  The remote even has a clock (woot!).  Lastly, from the remote only you can access the 'sweep' function.  This causes the internal dampers of the air output to sweep left to right and back, distributing the air over about 120 degrees of an arc.
I've only had the unit a week, so I can't rate its longevity, but its features and cooling ablilty are top notch.
Update:  I've now gone through two 90 degree plus days of bright sunshine, and the unit keeps the loft colder than the downstairs!  I consider that quite an acomplishment.  I continue to be very satisfied.

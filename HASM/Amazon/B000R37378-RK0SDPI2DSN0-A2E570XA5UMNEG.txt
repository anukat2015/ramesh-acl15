Title: Still waiting
Content:
I have just received my replacement unit for one that was already used when it was delivered to me.
The instructions (if that's what you want to call it {1 page})  that came with the unit were for another unit! I have no idea of the capacity of the water storage bin. There is no level indicator to see from the outside of the unit.  How much water should be put in without it over-flowing? How do I clean everythig that's supposed to be cleaned every month or so? No clue. Wrong instructions I'm pretty sure you're going to get this product back from me with a full refund on my behalf. There apparently is no quality control at this place and it makes me leary of keeping this unit and refering it to my friends, and I have alot. And we all live in the desert. HOT!!!

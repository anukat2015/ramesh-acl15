Title: Very Practical
Content:
I bought this single coffemaker to replace a similar Black&Decker one that I had been using daily over 10 years (the filter ripped and I couldn't find a replacement). I tried to go without one for 2 weeks, but I wasted a lot of coffee with a regular 4+cups maker.  On weekdays I'm the only coffeedrinker in my household, so this product is just what I need.  It is very practical and easy to clean, and it fits easily into a vehicle's cup holder.  The only difficulty I've had with this model is the very tight fitting lid.

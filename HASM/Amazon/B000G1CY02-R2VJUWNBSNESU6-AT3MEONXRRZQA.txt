Title: Hot and silent
Content:
Heats our bedroom toasty warm on the lowest setting even when it's snowing outside.  Allows us to turn central heating down low all night.  Super quiet. Would be nice if it had a temperature rating rather than 1-2-3, but after a few tries you figure out the right setting.

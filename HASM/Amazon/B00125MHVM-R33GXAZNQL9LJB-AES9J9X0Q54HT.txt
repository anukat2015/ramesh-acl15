Title: The software killed my computer!!!! BEWARE!
Content:
I recieved the camera this week. First of all. You can't use it till you buy a memory card. The manual is ok at best. However if you have a little experience with cameras. You will be happy with the A200 (alpha)..
DO NOT LOAD THE SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU BACK EVERYTHING UP!!!..The first time I tried to load it? My computer would not restart until it went thru troubleshoot mode. So I tried it again..Like the idiot I am...
Then it locked my computer up for good. The only way I could save my computer was with SYSTEM RECOVERY... I lost all my files and started from scratch...Then tried it again..After loading new software for a printer and a Canon camera...With the same result... Locked up on SONY..
The camera is OK...Beware of the software!...

Title: Good Through Two Versions
Content:
I first became acquainted with the Brewstation several years ago when it first came out. It was used in the workroom at the school where I taught. It went through very heavy use there. The handle in the "carafe" did break, but the machine is still plugging along 5 years later.
Recently, due to the untimely death of my own coffee machine, I purchased this model. The quality is adequate. There was a bit of a plastic flavor at first, but, as another user noted, a little vinegar solved that problem.
I'm satisfied with the flavor and quality of the coffee it makes. I'm not thrilled. Nevertheless it is adequate and unobjectionable.
The timer has been a nice feature. I like having coffee ready when I get up in the morning. I do wish I could turn off the bright light in the clock. I like a dark house at night.
My final note is that the opening into the water reservoir is a bit too narrow. If it were a bit wider, I'd be less likely to spill water as I fill it.
Overall, it's an adequate machine. It quietly does its job. It doesn't excel, but it doesn't disappoint either.

Title: Keurig Brewing System Really Delivers
Content:
I purchased this Keurig system as a gift for my wife as an alternative to using my drip coffee maker to quickly brew her tea. She was getting coffee flavored tea and I was getting tea flavored coffee. What a great compromise this system is. The system purges itself between brew cycles so you do not get that "carryover" into the next cup. We find that sampling the large selection of teas and coffees along with hot cocoas available to be fun. Our friends and neighbors enjoy being offered a wide range of hot drinks too. Thankfully, my wife is very good about sharing her "gift"!

Title: DeLonghi - Great product, Great price, Great performance
Content:
This is my 2nd Delonghi heater, the previous heater lasted over 15 years. I especially like the tradition with this product for solid construction, absolutely quiet operation at any temperature, and efficient radiant heat that easily adjusts to changing weather conditions.  It is really practical to have the ComforTemp energy efficient feature with this new generation unit as well as the manual heating option. The unit is used in a small home add-on office (20X10) that is subject to harsh winds from the west (Maryland cold and damp weather).  With the DeLonghi, the room is always comfortable. This was my 1st order from Amazon, I am so glad this quality product was offered. It was a great price, the service and delivery exceeded my expectations.

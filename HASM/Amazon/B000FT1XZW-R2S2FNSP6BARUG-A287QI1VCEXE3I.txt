Title: Great product.  Everything you need from a heater.
Content:
I have tried it in my bedroom and it is a very good heater as it does what it's supposed to.  Very quiet I forget it's even there (compared to my older heater).  I have kids in the house and what I was worried about was that they would get burnt by it.  The heater is hot (also depends on your heat settings) but it is the type of heat that you have to leave your hand there for a couple seconds before you feel a burn.  Highly recommended to anyone looking to replace or buy a new heater.

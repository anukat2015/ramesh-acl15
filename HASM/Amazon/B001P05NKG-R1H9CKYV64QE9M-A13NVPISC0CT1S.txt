Title: Very disappointed, not worth the price.
Content:
I got a Mac believing in those Mac vs PC TV ads. I thought that I would be able to find games, use my existing USB devices with the Mac. Many of my devices, including my scanner, my card reader, do not work with Mac. I can't find apps that I had back on Windows. I will return this back to the Apple store and switch back to PC.
Apple advertises that Macs have better device support... Sorry but that's just a lie. I was much more happier with Windows... :(

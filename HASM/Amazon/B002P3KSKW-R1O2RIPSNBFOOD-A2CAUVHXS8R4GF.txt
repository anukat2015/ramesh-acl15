Title: Great laptop, even better battery.
Content:
I purchased this laptop so that my wife would be able to study abroad and have a laptop that she didn't have to worry about having to plug in all the time. What we got was a solid performing laptop with an as advertised battery life. This is my second Acer product and I am very happy with the quality of this product.
Things I like:
-Aluminum lid so no fingerprints all over
-great battery life
-quick to startup and after hibernation
-touchpad is very responsive
-keyboard keys are smooth but surprisingly easy to type on
-wireless N lan connection

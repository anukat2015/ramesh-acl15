Title: MACBOOK PRO DELIVERS IN ALMOST EVERY WAY
Content:
I'll agree with every positive thing being said in the previous reviews.  I was a life long Windows user that switched to Mac.  I've used various Macs in the past and had become pretty familiar with OS X....but this is the first Apple I've personally owned.  Having said that....OS X is so powerful it makes the computing life so much easier.  I believe many PC users that "hate" Apple are more afraid of changing than actually having a reason to dislike Apple.
Anyways...  My only complaint about the MBP is the screen resolution.  On the 15 inch version the resolution is a native 1440x900.  At first I was a bit put off by this--but considering how crisp and bright the LCD screen is I was willing to operate at the "lower" resolution.  I went from my previous laptop's resolution of 1280x1050 to 1440x900 and after a few days I'm pretty happy.  Still the question remains as to why Apple would limit you to this lower resolution.
Everything else about the MBP is top notch.  At first I thought the aluminum casing would be to delicate for everyday use--but fortunately the casing seems to be bulletproof.  It doesn't seem to fingerprint or scratch easily at all.
All in all you cannot go wrong with the MBR.  If you think, as I did, that the lower resolution would be a deterrent to taking the step into Apple's world--don't be.  At the very least go look at this beautiful LED driven screen and see what you're missing...or should I say not going to miss?

Title: Terrible
Content:
I purchased two different shark products. Both of them quit working after a couple of months. I thought maybe it was something I did wrong with the first one so I got the second.I used the product just like the manual said. It kept overheating and is now emiting sparks inside by the motor(don't think it's supposed to do that). I loved it when I first bought it, but will not buy another.

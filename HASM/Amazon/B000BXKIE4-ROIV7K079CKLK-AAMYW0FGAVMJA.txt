Title: Almost Perfect
Content:
The Electrolux Oxy 3 provides the quality we've come to expect from Electrolux; it's smartly designed, easily maneuverable, and attractive. It's quiet--until you fire up the power brush, which is plain scary! The power brush is designed well to slide under chairs and tables--but that same maneuverability is a hindrance when running across straight floors and carpets. Anybody know how to change the filter bag and close the lid? The instruction book doesn't help a lot!

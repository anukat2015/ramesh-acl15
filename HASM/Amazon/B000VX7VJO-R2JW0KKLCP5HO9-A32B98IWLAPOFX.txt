Title: Worth the upgrade
Content:
We had the original Keurig single cup machine for a few years and decided we wanted to upgrade.   We love the features of this machine - the 4 brew sizes are great, and we also love that there is another brew temp.  It is very stylish and looks great on the counter.  We were concerned from a couple of reviews about the vibration, but we simply remove the drip tray when brewing and that eliminates the problem.  Would highly recommend this product!

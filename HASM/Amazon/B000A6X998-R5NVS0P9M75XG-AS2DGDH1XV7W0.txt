Title: You Will be Pleased
Content:
I needed a space heater for a 650 sq ft room where I spend most of my day. I placed this heater behind my desk about 4 feet from where I work and under a window.  I am pleasantly warm and during the day the room even warms nicely.  Don't expect this heater to be a room heater. It is meant to warm objects near it and this it does wonderfully.  I keep the main furnace thermostat about 4 degrees less than the heater thermostat and the main furnace only kicks off when I shut off the space heater at night.  I highly recommend the Holmes Quartz heater for those who are fairly stationary during those cold days, but want to be warm without constantly running the main house furnace/heating system.

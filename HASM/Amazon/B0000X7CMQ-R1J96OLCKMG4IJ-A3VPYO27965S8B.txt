Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
***2 RATING****
AFTER I RATED THIS PRODUCT THE VERY NEXT DAY MY COFFEE MAKER BROKE. IT HAS ONLY BEEN USED FOR ABOUT A MONTH. I AM NOW SENDING IT BACK TO BE FIXED BUT IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS.
I have owned this for about a month now and I am really happy with it. The coffee tastes great and it brews in a couple of minutes and stays hot in the carafe for a minimum of an hour. The #4 filters dont fit perfectly so you have to cut them or fold them at the seam which is an easy fix and well worth it for the quality of coffee it produces. Also, the tablespoon to cup ratio is almost spot on, which I also really like. Overall, a great coffee maker.

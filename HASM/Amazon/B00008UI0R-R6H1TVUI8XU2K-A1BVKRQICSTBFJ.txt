Title: Only lasted 3 years.  Not happy with Quality of it.
Content:
When I got this vacuum I was quite pleased with it!  It sucks up stuff really well and seems to clean a lot of dust out of the carpets, etc.    So I was quite pleased with that.  I didn't care for the bagless system and all the dust that blows around when emptying it.  But I empty it in the garage, so at least the dust is not back in the house.    As for the filter... I have to clean it frequently and its hard to clean.  I use our air compressor to blow out the junk and that works great.  Don't know what I would do if I didn't have an air compressor!
As for the quality - its pretty bad.   After only 3 years, its just about dead!   The big head attachment for carpets no longer rolls - and we've cleaned out the hair that gets caught in it many times.  But now it no longer rolls.  So thats useless.  Today I was trying to use it and there must be something wrong with the electrical system because when pressing the buttons nothing happens.  I have to jiggle it and hope that it will connect so I can turn it off or on.   
So basically I'm now looking for a new vacuum.  Would love to find one that lasts beyond 3 years.  And this one was only good for maybe the first 6 months or year.   I certainly don't recommend this one.   I gave it 2 stars because at least it sucks stuff up really well!  Otherwise I would have given it 1 star.

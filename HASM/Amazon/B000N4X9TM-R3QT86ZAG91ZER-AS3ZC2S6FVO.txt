Title: Great Unit
Content:
Its great.  No buckets of water to empty daily and well worth the cost. I use it to cool a spare bedroom that is usually very hot, and it has made that room cool enough to make it comfortable to sleep in.  It does vent out a window, but easily moved into closet during cooler months or as a back up a/c when the whole house air fails.  It will only cool one room, but at this price point, ([...]) its well worth any short falls.  Velcro remote to top of unit so does not get lost is suggested or keeping remote in a nearby draw for safe keeping.

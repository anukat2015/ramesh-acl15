Title: Great iPod .. wish it came in a 32GB version
Content:
These are great because they are small, easy to carry, 
and easy to hide when not in use. I really wish
you could get a 32GB version. That would 
suffice for most people's library of music,
and leave some room for shooting video.
If you're a Ford Microsoft Sync owner .. GOOD NEWS.
Works in a 2009 Ford Product w/ version 2.1 of Sync.
Cover flow is pretty cool. And I like the widescreen
for movies. Shake to shuffle seems like a novelty,
but does work as advertised.
Overall, very happy with our purchase.

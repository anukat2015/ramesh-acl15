Title: Great!
Content:
This is the first MP3 player I've ever bought and I couldn't be more pleased.  I don't really care for using iTunes with it but I use a third party software program to get around that.
Overall, the sound quality is great especially for a small player and the interface is easy to get around.  It gets my two thumbs up.

Title: works just fine
Content:
Used it while staining some wood in my garage during the winter and worked just fine.  When we moved it into the house which we are remodeling and had no heat it just did an ok job due to the large amount of space.  But it isn't meant to heat that large of a space. But it did enough to enable us to get some work done.  Worth the price though and would recommend.

Title: Fantastic Full Frame DSLR for the money
Content:
This is my first full frame camera and I'm loving it! I have been using the Nikon D700 for over a week now with a variety of Nikon and non-Nikon lenses and the photo results are just superb.  From moving subjects, landscape, portrait, night photography, this thing just delivers nice photos.  I really liked the build quality of the D700.  You would think it was built to last for many years.  I was very impressed by it's focus speed and accuracy even in low light.  This may be the best in it's class right now.  I tried the Canon 5D Mark II and wasn't impressed and returned it after testing it for a couple of weeks.  The D700 is a keeper and I'm still very happy that I stuck with it!  
The users manual is helpful but I would recommend to buy a very good book to supplement the techniques in using this model. It will help you unleash all the capabilities of this fine DSLR.
If you want a full frame camera that won't break the bank and deliver class leading focus performance and excellent image quality you won't go wrong with the D700.

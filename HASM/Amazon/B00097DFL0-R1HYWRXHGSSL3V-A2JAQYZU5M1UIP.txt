Title: Works great!
Content:
We heard these didn't work that well, but was forced to give one a try--have been very pleasantly surprised.  It really cools the room!  Have run it for almost two months and it hasn't needed draining yet.  It is pretty noisy and we wish it had a lower fan setting, but all in all we're very happy with it.

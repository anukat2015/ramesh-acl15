I have purchased a variety of space heaters over the years in the $40-$55.00 price range.  They were all mediocre at best.  I recently purchased the Pelonis B-6A1 after the reading the reviews.  After it arrived and I had a chance to use it, I ordered two more.  This product is a blow torch in comparison to other space heaters.  You may pay more for this product, but consider it the equivalent in heating power of 2-3 other space heaters combined.

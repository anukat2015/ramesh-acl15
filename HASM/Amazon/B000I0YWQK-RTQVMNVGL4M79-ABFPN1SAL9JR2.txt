Title: Great Heater!
Content:
I bought this heater last winter and I have to say it works very well.  I have not had any problems at all with it.  I like that you can set it on automatic.  It heats up my living room pretty fast.  Obviously if you have a bigger room to heat it will take longer or you may need more than one.  I am very happy with it.  It definitely helps lower my gas bill.  I'm actually buying another one for my son's room.

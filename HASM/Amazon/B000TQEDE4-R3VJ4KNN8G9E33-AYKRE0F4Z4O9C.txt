Title: For best taste- thermal carafes is the way to go!
Content:
I'm not a hard core coffee drinker, but I purchased this for my guests. First off, I now recognize the reasons for a thermal carafe.... because regular coffee makers with a reheat pad will produce a bitter tasting coffee.  This Cuisinart, with it's thermal carafe, produces coffee that tastes great even one hour later.  There is no "heat pad" on this, so the heat from the coffee keeps the carafe warm, which keeps the coffee warm.
It DOES poor slowly and requires effort.  But I know why... there must be a small valve by design for pouring because anything larger would let the heat escape.  Function over form!
It has a permanent gold mesh filter, which is nice, but to clean out the coffee grounds requires more water in the sink.  Paper filter could probably work.
It's not too tall, but requires us to pull the coffee maker out from the cabinet to refill with water.
Very pleased with the looks and function!

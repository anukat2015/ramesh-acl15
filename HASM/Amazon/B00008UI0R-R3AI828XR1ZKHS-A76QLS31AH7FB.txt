Title: Another Winner from Hoover! (I th0ought, at first)
Content:
UPDATED REVIEW: AT FIRST I LIKED THIS VACUUM, BUT AFTER HAVING TO TAKE APART THE POWER HEAD AND PUT THE BELT BACK ON DOZENS OF TIMES EACH & EVERY TIME I USED IT, I CALLED HOOVER AND THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT MOTOR AND SOME NEW BELTS - APPARENTLY THEY HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH BELTS COMING OFF, AND THE WAY THE MOTOR SHAFT WAS GROUND WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM. WELL, I INSTALLED THE NEW MOTOR AND A NEW BELT AND IT SEEMED TO WORK OK FOR A SHORT TIME. (ABOUT 3 USES!) TODAY I TRIED TO VACUUM MY BEDROOM, AND NOTICED THAT THE BRUSH WASN'T TURNING EXCEPT WHEN I LIFTED IT FROM THE CARPET! THE BELT NO LONGER SLINGS OFF, IT JUST GETS BURNT UP BY THE MOTOR SHAFT SPINNING ALOT FASTER THAN THE BELT/BRUSH CAN MOVE. I AM GOING TO TRY TO REPAIR THE BEARINGS IN THE 30 YEAR OLD HOOVER THAT I STILL HAVE (THAT STILL RUNS REAL GOOD) SO I CAN VACUUM MY BEDROOM. BETWEEN HAVING TO EMPTY THE TINY DUST CUP EVERY 2 MINUTES (MAYBE) AND THE LOUSY, USELESS POWER HEAD, I REALLY WISH I WOULD HAVE SENT THIS STUPID & USELESS MACHINE BACK AND GOT A REFUND!THIS VACUUM IS OK EXCEPT FOR THE HALF-PINT DUST CUP, BUT THE POWER HEAD DESIGN IS TOTAL JUNK, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
I bought this Hoover to replace a Eureka upright bagless that did little but "wind up" dog fur around the brush bearings! I spent more time unwinding Queenie's fur from the brush than I did vacuuming. This Hoover cannister found dirt in my bedroom carpet that the Eureka never even thought about. I did have to unwind some Queenie fur from the brush, but not like the other one. I didn't have to completely disassemble the darn thing in order to get the fur off. Queenie's fur is about 4" to 6" long, so there's no vacuum with a rotating brush that isn't "hampered" by her hair. I also have an old Hoover Spirit bagger cannister vacuum that is at least 20 years old and still works great. I use it for small jobs like cleaning my window A/C filters and electronic equipment. This is why I went with another (reliable) Hoover. The only drawback that I can see with this new Hoover is that the "stalk" or "wand" has plastic parts which makes the thing feel kind of flexible when vacuuming. My old cannister is a "tank", but nobody makes things as tough as they used to 20 years ago! The dirt cup fills up fast, but I think that once I get the dirt out of my carpet that the other vacuums were missing, it will seem to be a lot bigger! I bet I got 10 pounds of dirt & sand out of my carpet, and that's only about a 20 square foot section, as I've yet to move all the furniture! I think that this vacuum is well worth the money, and hopefully, with careful use, it will provide as many years of service as my other Hoover has. I also like the variable suction feature. I have a vacuum attachment called a "Pet-Vac" that is kind of a fur trap with a real long hose that has a rubber fingered fur shedding brush. I use it to de-fur my doggies. When I tried to use it before, my other vacuum had too much suction and caused the "filter ball" inside the Pet-Vac to stick to the top and stop the air flow. The middle setting on this new Hoover is purr-fect, as it provides sufficient suction for the Pet-Vac to function, but doesn't make the ball suck to the top and mess things up! I say "BUY ONE"!!

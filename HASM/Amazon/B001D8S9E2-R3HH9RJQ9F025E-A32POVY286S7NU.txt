Title: The best Macbook if you don't care about "firewire"
Content:
I owned so far 4 macbook
I have 2 Macbook Black 13.3 (2.2 and 2.4 Ghz)
and 1 Macbook Pro 15.4 2.4Ghz, not unibody and I recently bought 13.3 2.4Ghzz unibody, this one is sleek and 
fast, I ran some apps like excel/work/pdf/picture to compared with my 15.4, and the 13.3 seem like faster
The body is slim, and easy to carry them any where
The battery seem OK, but will not last as long as the old 13.3, 45Watt vs. 60Watt, I dim/turn-off other things, and managed to get about 3 1/2 hours+ for web surfing/running some apps
2 USB ports was too close to each other, I use my verizon USB data card for work, and something I have to unplug it to plug in other USB device, I wish Apple can make one on each side, the workaround is I bought a cheap USB adapter on ebay  to have more access.
I do not want to get the 15.4 unibody, if you do put the old 15.4 side with 15.4 unibody, the new 15.4 look bigger (cause it has black frame LCD and black key board), that why is standout and look big, no weight saving at all
So far this 13.3 2.4Ghz is really good for daily use and has enough HP as 15.4, except video RAM/Fire wire and big screen
I am mobile a lot and do not want to carry any more weight on my backpack
Go to apple store I try it out, you will love it

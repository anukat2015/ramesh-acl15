Title: Great Value - Perfect for Running!
Content:
Pros
- Size
- Durability
- Price
- Clip on function
- Long Charge Life
Cons
- Only can be charged through computer (w/o buying more equipt.)
- Shuffle mode is not completly random
- Earbuds are cheap (I hate the Apple ear buds, though a plus is that you can sell them new on eBay for $20+!)
My arm would actually get sore from carrying my iPod Video on my arm for long runs.  So I bought this iPod Shuffle and no problems anymore as this is the most comfortable mp3 player you will ever use... just clip it to your shirt, shorts, pants or whatever and you are set to go.

Title: Don't Buy One!
Content:
This has got to be the absolute worst coffee maker I have ever owned. Constantly leaks coffee all over the counter. Sometimes when the buzzer goes off letting you know the coffee is done, if you go to grab a cup of coffee its still filling coffee into the pot and you risk getting burned. I would never buy this brand again.

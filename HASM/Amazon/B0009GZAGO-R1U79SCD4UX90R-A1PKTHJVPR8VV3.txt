Title: Great camera, too bad they stopped making them
Content:
The Nikon D50 is no longer in production, but you can find them used online.  This is a great camera.  They say it's a beginner camera, but it has almost every feature someone that's been shooting for a while would need.  Specifically, a dedicated button for ISO and White Balance give you easy access to two thing I commonly use.  Only thing I wish it had was a Black and White mode and an illuminated display on top.  Other than that, a great great camera.

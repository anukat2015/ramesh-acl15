Title: Wow! Lots of space for a great price.
Content:
When I set out to replace my aging MP3 player, I really did not know which one to go with. The most popular brand with the fruit on it was out of the question due to proprietary software. I bought the Sansa Fuze 8 GB but returned it to Best Buy a week later after realizing I needed more space for all my music. Sure you can insert a micro SD card but that was more money. I was looking for a 16 GB player when I stumbled on to this beauty. With the Creative Zen, there is no need for memory cards although there is a slot for one. 32 GB is A LOT of space. Still in the process of putting all my music on it but I can tell there will be no problem. I plan to convert some of my vinyl and put it on there as well. If you are looking for a decent player with room to spare, the Zen is definitely worth a look.

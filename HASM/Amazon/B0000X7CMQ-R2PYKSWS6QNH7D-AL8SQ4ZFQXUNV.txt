Title: Excellent coffee maker, very happy purchase!
Content:
I was swayed to purchase this coffee maker by the reviews and by my experience with the brand (I have a rice cooker that I LOVE).  I was not led astray!  First, I was impressed by the reviews b/c they seemed to be written by real coffee connoisseurs...reviews for other thermal carafe coffee makers (although positive), did not seem to be by such avid coffee lovers.  Second, I have a rice cooker by Zojirushi, which I have owned for 3 years, and I really love.  Though this is their first foray into coffee makers, they are very good at small appliances.  
This coffee maker has not disappointed me.  It brews well and the coffee stays warm for a long time.  I took the advice of some reviewers and started brewing starting with hot water.  That makes it super hot and then it stays warm even longer.  Although I miss not putting the carafe in the dishwasher, it is not hard to wash, the mouth is wide.  And I can't break this one like I did my glass one!
I highly recommend this coffee maker!

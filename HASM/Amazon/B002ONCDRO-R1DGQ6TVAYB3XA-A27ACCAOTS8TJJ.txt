Title: MY HP PAVILION DV7-3060
Content:
Great screen and graphics, comfortable keyboard and I especially like the numeric keypad,plenty of storage and memory and although there are faster processors now, this is fine for my uses like spreadsheets and movies. I like the exteded battery life and I have completely replaced my desktop. What I most appreceated was the ease and convienience of shopping it at Amazon online and the great price.

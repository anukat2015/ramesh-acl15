Title: best purchase ever!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
I love, love, LOVE this machine. It is easy to use. It is so quiet. Everyone in the family can make exactly the flavor and strength coffee they like for much less than a Starbucks coffee. This machine was a blessing at Thanksgiving time with 8 adults staying in the house. I bought the k-cup tree and set it out and people could easily make their own cup of coffee any time of the day. It makes life a lot easier for guests to help themselves with an unfamiliar coffee maker. You just lift the handle, place a k-cup, close the handle, and press the size cup you'd like.  I love that K cups can be delivered right to my door!  I rave about this machine to everyone who will listen.  It makes you a happier person in the morning.

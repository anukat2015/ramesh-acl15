Title: What can you say about metal legs?
Content:
I bought the Cozy Legs Radiant Heater Panel and thought that these metal legs were required.  Quite frankly, while they work, they really aren't that much of an improvement over what came with the Heater Panel.
Still, they do and adequate job, and they are a tiny bit more aestetically pleasing than the included 'legs.' 
My advice - buy these only after you try the included legs.

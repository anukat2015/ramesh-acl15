Title: Does the job well
Content:
Got this to cool my bedroom, because if it gets windy I can't open the window unless I want the wind to take it lol. Added some water, tray of ice and it got the job done fast and nice. When I am not using water, I pop a ice pack on the top compartment and it still cools the bedroom just as good :)

Title: LEAKS!
Content:
This is my second BCO-130T Coffee/Espresso machine.  The first one worked well for about 8 months then started leaking.  They sent me a new one two months after I called customer service.  The second unit is now leaking after 11 months of use.  Customer Service said that I will need too send to Appliance Parts Mart to get fixed leaving me with out a coffee pot. I responded with "What am I to make coffe in?" The CSR Rep said that I should buy a cheap coffee maker to have while mine is in the shop being repaired! Do not waste your money!

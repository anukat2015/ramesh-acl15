Title: Presto Dish Heater
Content:
I have had good results with this heater set on medium; otherwise on the high setting it gets too hot and the buzzer alarm sounds. It is good for heating small spaces and it is directional where the heat is directed. I have used mine for a few years now. I go through lamp light bulbs; but other than that it has been trouble free. I do like that the power supply stops if the heater is knocked over. The alarm is a loud constant buzz sound. I ordered a cleaning tool from the Presto company which amazon might sell; but it really makes it easy to keep the dish clean.

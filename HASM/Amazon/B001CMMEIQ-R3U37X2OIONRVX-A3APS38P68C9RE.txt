Title: Big waste of money
Content:
If you can get it to run, it's very noisy.  I got it to run at first start once. Most times it took 1.5 to 2 hours to start. You have to wait 5 to 10 minutes between each try, so it was very aggravating having this unit occupy your time for up to 2 hours to get it to start.  Not worth the money. Worst purchase I ever made. I only gave it one star because Amazon won't let me give no stars.

Title: What a Little Gem!
Content:
We heat differently then most folks; just the room that we're in instead of the whole house. For the past 20 years or so we got along just fine with a kerosene heater even though it was a bit of a pain having to fuss with pouring fuel into the tank with a funnel and the odor when you first fired it up. Last year clear grade kerosene jumped to $3.49 a gallon and this year $6.21. I saw this little heater and with propane only $1.65 a gallon I figured - No Brainer!!! Right out of the box and onto a five gallon tank took all of five minutes and this little gem worked flawlessly the first time and ever since. No hassle, no pouring, no warm up period, no wick burn off every week, no odor at all, just instant, focused heat. Great value for the price!

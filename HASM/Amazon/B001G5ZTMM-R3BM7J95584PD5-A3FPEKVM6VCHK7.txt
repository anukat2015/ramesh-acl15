Title: Amazing Camera!
Content:
I've had it for a couple of weeks now and I love it. It shoots in super low light! It does everything it claims to do. The picture is really what makes it worth it. It simply looks amazing. It has so much depth it almost looks 3D! No problems at all. No complaints. I highly recommend it!

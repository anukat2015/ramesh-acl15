Title: Great laptop!
Content:
I have the non-glossy version of this MacBook Pro. It is one great machine. It is fast and has lots of hard drive space. I use Parallels and Windows XP for the single Windows program I need to run. The MacBook Pro handles it all well. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a powerful laptop.

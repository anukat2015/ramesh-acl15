Title: Amazing Heating Capability
Content:
This heater really is very safe. It is cool less than a half inch from the back surface of the heater, making it wall mountable using the hardware provided. We really like this feature because we have small children that would easily touch or fall into a normal ground based heater.  
The only problem we had with the heater is that the amazon information said it could be in an area around water and splashes were not a problem and the documentation that came with the heater said otherwise. We are using the heater up on a wall in our bathroom further from the tub/shower area that initially planned. 
Great purchase! No regrets!

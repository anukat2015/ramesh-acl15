Title: All about capacity!!!
Content:
This is the fourth Apple iPod classic 120 GB Black (6th Generation) I have owned (1st gen 10gb, 4th ,or was it 5th?> gen 30 gb, and a 1 gb Shuffle).  After acquiring enough content to max out the 30 gb, I knew it was time for a change.  
If you're looking for bells and whistles, look at the Touches or the iPhone... if you're looking for a single device to store all your music, video, and podcasts without having to constantly manually reorder playlists or decide which podcasts you can live without, this is the iPod for you.  
I travel for business and often use that time to catch up on marketing and business podcasts.  Previously, this would require me to move music off the iPod to free up space for the podcasts.  Now I grab and go.  
Coupled with a decent set of Bose® QuietComfort® 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling® Headphones and you've just built yourself a mini Fortress of Solitude, even in Cubicle Hell...

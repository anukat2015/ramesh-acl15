Title: Plastic connectors break and are not replaceable
Content:
Vacuum has great suction. 
The plastic connections break easily.  One connector broke on the shaft and it cost $65.00 to replace the whole shaft at an authorized repair shop?  The  part did not fit when I got it home. Another attachment part was missing in the original shipment and had to be purchased.   It looks like these vacuums were not made all alike.  Replacement parts do not fit from the factory or from authorized dealer?  It takes months to get refund for a part that did not fit.

Title: Dangerously overheats
Content:
I bought this computer last June, but only used it for a few weeks and then shelved it because the sound card went and I couldn't use it for skype which is essential for me.   I couldn't send it back for repair because I bought it in the US and then brought it to Israel with me.   However, a few weeks ago I took it out of storage because my other laptop broke.  I still can't use it for skype, but now another even more troubling problem has happened.  It literally gets burning hot after just a few minutes use and actually caused a burn to exposed skin.  I wish I could return this.  It is not even a fast computer - just average.  Also the battery last no more than an hour max fully charged.  I would definitely not recommend!  Very disappointing!!

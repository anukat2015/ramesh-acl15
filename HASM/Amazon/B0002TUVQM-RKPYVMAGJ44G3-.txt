Title: FAR EXCEEDED
Content:
THIS PRODUCT FAR EXCEEDED WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDKIDS, AS THEY REALLY LOVE HOT COCOA. MY DAUGHTER SAID,"IT GETS PUT AWAY ABOUT ONE DAY A WEEK". SHE LOVES IT ALSO. NOW SHE DOES NOT HAVE TO STIR THE MIX OVER THE STOVE. THE OTHER NIGHT I WAS AT THEIR HOME AND THEY MADE SOME. IT WAS ON THE COUNTER FOR AWILE AND I HEARD A NOISE AND AKED HER, "WHAT IS THAT"? SHE TOLD ME THAT AFTER AWILE OF SITTING, IT WILL STIR AND HEAT UP THE COCOA AGAIN. THE MACHINE IS VERY QUIET. I AM VERY IMPRESSED. FAST SHIPPING ALSO. THANKS!

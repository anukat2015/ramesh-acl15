Title: Love my new camera
Content:
This is my first SLR and I've only had it for about a week, but I absolutely love it!  The automatic modes run laps around my old point and shoot, but the real fun is in manual modes.  The menu is very intuitive and easy to make the necessary changes I'm looking for.  I'm not a big fan of hard light and don't really like the built-in flash.  I played around a little with the flash compensation, white balance and ISO, but I still find the flash not to my liking.  I just ordered the SB-400 with a diffuser so I'm looking forward to some more balanced lighting.  I highly recommend the D40 to any entry-level DSLR owner.

Title: Pretty good student laptop
Content:
We're replacing the ASUS EeePC that we used for university classes.  It's a perfect 'tweener' between an underpowered Netbook and a heavy, bad battery life laptop.  I'd call it a Lapbook.  Beautiful screen that is shorter than a full size laptop.  Recommend a bluetooth mouse because the track pad is pretty small.
My only complaint is that for some reason it take a long time to launch any application after bringing out of hibernate and logging in.  My wife logged in and clicked on Firefox.  Didn't launch for 2 minutes.

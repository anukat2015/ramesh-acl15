Title: Hunk of Junk
Content:
An absolute hunk of junk!  Mine (purchased 5 months ago) has never been easy to clean is currently on the way to the local landfill after I tired of using pliers to remove the grinder and basket attachment.  Even using pliers, the grinder feature is impossible to remove.  While having freshly brewed coffee is nice, this machine is not worth the hassle and agrivation!

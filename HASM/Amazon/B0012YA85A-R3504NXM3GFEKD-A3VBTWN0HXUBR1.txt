Title: Awesome camera kit, nice job Canon!!
Content:
I'm very satisfied with this camera. I'm a fine art painter and digital concept artist so I take tons of reference images. It offers all I need for now, i'll upgrade to a higher end Canon or Nikon when I get the dough.  
PROS
great image quality
accurate color
nice functions
large preview screen
lightweight for a digital SLR
good value EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens, images are clear and crisp
CONS
ISO speed only goes to 1600, not very ideal for night photography
Zoom with the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens isn't that great

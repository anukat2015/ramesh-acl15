Title: Dirt Devil Canister Vacuum is a good deal
Content:
I am very pleased with my Dirt Devil canister vacuum. The amount of suction really surprised me, and seems to be more than the old Rainbow vacuum I used for 40 years. I am especially pleased with the light weight and ease of use of this vacuum. The attachements are easy to connect and use, and the canister is easy to empty.

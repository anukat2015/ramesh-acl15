Title: Brew, and walk away!
Content:
I was a little nervous about purchasing this coffee maker, I added to my Amazon cart on a few occassiona and removed, finally I decided to get it and I am very happy I did.  This machine brew the perfect cup of coffee every single time - i have yet to have a cup the didn't taste the same!  The machine makes coffee really quick - and all the indicators for water level, and how much coffee you have left are nice features - the feature that has stood out the most to me is the the auto shut off feature - sometimes when I am alone I am not going to drink 12 cups of coffee in two hours - so I am able to set it for four hours instead and still get a warm cup of coffe up till and hour after it has shut down!  This machine is not on the pricy side either - look at other ones - they are plastic, this is all mostly medal and looks great too!  Well worth the money in my opinon!

Title: Poor performance, particularly for the price
Content:
We bought this heater at a well-known department store, where the associate assured us that it should heat one large or two medium-sized rooms.  However, we exchanged it soon after for two radiant heaters (which cost less total than this unit alone).
The Lasko does look nice and blows warm air.  However, it would run for hours in our [albeit drafty] 12 x 10 ft. living room and never achieved a temperature above 62 degrees, even with the central heat system set at 60.
We also regretted its lack of an automatic shut-off feature.  The unit is top-heavy (the bottom space seems only to serve the purpose of elevating the ceramic element to a comfortable height), so we were concerned about problems if it toppled over.

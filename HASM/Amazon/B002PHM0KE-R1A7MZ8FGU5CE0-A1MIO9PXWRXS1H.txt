Title: Sony did a great job
Content:
We researched for 2 months before buying this.  Great laptop.  Sony did a great job with the design, looks and also the special "Web" button.  This is so under-advertised!  You do not have to fire up the slow Windows 7 to access the web!  It is a 3rd party software which makes it so convenient for quick easy web access, after the initial setup.  Wish more folks come up with products other than Microsoft!  Not too impressed with Windows 7 so far, but can live with it.  Google Chrome is the default web browser (after windows starts), okay but IE 8 works better for some websites.  I'm having some issues with the Chrome web browser.  Good screen resolution, clarity, decent battery life.  Laptop does not get too hot!  We love this sony laptop!!  The other laptop we considered was a CW from sony.  But this was great for the 15.6 screen and the price!!!  Hope other manufacturers can make laptops as attractive as Sony and Apple!

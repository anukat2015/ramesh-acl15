Title: Great laptop at a great price
Content:
I got this laptop at the Black Friday price of $469.00. It's a great medium size laptop with an AMD M500 which performs about on par with a Core 2 Duo T6600. It also has a 10 key which is really nice. With 3g of RAM upgradeable to 8 (I boosted mine to 4) and 320g of storage it will perform well and store all the music and video I need. I gave 4 stars because it could have a better video card and I prefer the older Toshiba style Touchpad that is indented rather than flush with the casing. I believe that the 32 bit OS it comes with will only recognize 4 gigs of RAM, so it is odd that they assume you could beef up the RAM to 8 with a 32 bit OS. I installed Windows 7 64 bit so problem solved. Also,it is Toshiba! Great quality. If you are looking for a lower priced laptop with a good amount of storage and modern processing ability, this one could definitely fit the bill! A manual to turn it on? Seriously???

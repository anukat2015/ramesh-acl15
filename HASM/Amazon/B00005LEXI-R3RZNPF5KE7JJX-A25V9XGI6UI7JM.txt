Title: Little Heater is a Big help!
Content:
This heater has a small footprint and doesn't take up much space.  It is working great in our garage as a supplement to our electric heater.  It is nice and toasty up close to it, and it warms our 2 car garage up slowly to a decent level to do woodworking.  It is perfect because my second electric heater was tripping the circuit breaker whenever I used power tools.
The only thing to remember is to keep it away from the sawdust!  I like it so much, we're buying another one, so we can ditch the other electric heater.  (I'm tired of tripping on cords!)

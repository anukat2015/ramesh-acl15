Title: Not bad, not for coffee lovers either
Content:
If you're not a coffee connoisseur, this will more than meet your needs. It's for people used to the taste you get from a Mr. Coffee or a Black & Decker. The design makes for easy use and it performs admirably. But I returned mine because I like the deep, strong flavor that higher-end machines like Breville, Capresso, and Jura deliver. The basket filter (rather than cone), temperature, and lack of a more advanced brewing system   deliver a taste that's OK, but not great. Still, if you're looking for a well-designed coffee maker that's easy to use, DeLonghi delivers.

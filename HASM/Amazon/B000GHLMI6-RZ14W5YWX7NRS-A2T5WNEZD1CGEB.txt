Title: No more spills!
Content:
We first encountered a coffee maker like this at a bed and breakfast and thought it was a great idea.  It is nice to set your coffee maker at night for the next morning and not have to wonder if you'll find coffee all over the floor (due to not having the coffee pot under the filter just so).  There is also no mess when pouring coffee.  Just place your cup under it!  Also keeps coffee very hot for long time without that "cooked" taste.  Very satisfied!

Title: This is the best under desk space heater I've had yet!
Content:
The Vornado SoleAir is a great personal space heater for under a desk. With my old heater I would have to turn it off and on constantly because it would get too warm. This is the perfect temp to keep on steadily. The design keeps my feet propped up and comfortable. It's also very light, easy to move around. The buttons are easy to reach with your feet, though I do sometimes bump it to off. I am really pleased!

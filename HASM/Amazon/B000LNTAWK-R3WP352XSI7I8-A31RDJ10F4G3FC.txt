Title: Absolutely Great!
Content:
I got one of these for my photography class since I love to take photos.  This is by far the easiest camera to use.  Functions are easy to comphrehend and it takes SUPERB pictures.  It is a bit old since new models have came out but it is still a great buy and definitely a steal for the poor professionals or beginners :).

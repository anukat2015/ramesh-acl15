Title: Excellent machine!
Content:
I've had my Delonghi Caffe Elite for over 5 years now and it's the best coffee maker I've owned yet. It may have just reached the end of its useful life as today the auto shut off function doesn't seem to be working.  I will have the machine checked out to see if it needs to be retired.  What's great is that the machine has been used to make two or three pots a day every day since I bought it.  I grind my coffee before each use, clean the machine once every couple of months and the coffee is still as excellent as when I got the machine and that's saying a lot.  My last decent coffee maker was a Krups and by the second year the coffee wasn't tasting the same nor good, and it never was as good tasting as the coffee from my Delonghi machine was so it was replaced.  The Delonghi has been reliable and is robustly made although it appears quite simple and elegant in its design.  I've not experienced any breakages or any other problems that have been noted by others and I strongly recommend this over any Mr. Coffee or Krups coffee makers.  This is one of the great machines that makes real honest to goodness coffee junkie Java!

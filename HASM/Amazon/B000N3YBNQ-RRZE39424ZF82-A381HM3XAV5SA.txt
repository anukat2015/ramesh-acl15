Title: Strong Suction, sufficient cable length, excellent design.
Content:
First, I have to object to certain feedbacks that claim that cable is not long enough. It is long, given the compactness of the machine; I do not think it would be possible to place 30 feet long cable into this machine. Suction is very strong; it has brushing mechanism that easily lifts cat hair. When compacted, it can be stored in a small closet. One nice design area was that, the controls are right at the handle of the unit; you can control the sucking with your thumb. One issue is that due to design, the front wheel and rear wheels are distanced, therefore, turning around the corners are not very easy. However, I would recommend this as first or second vacuum cleaner in you house. It design is very pleasing; it reminds you that you are in fact living in 21st century.

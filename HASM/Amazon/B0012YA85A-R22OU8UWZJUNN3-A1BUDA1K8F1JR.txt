Title: Incredible
Content:
I upgraded from a Kodak 6.1MP camera which has an equivalent resolution of 100ASA 35mm Film.  this thing is double!  The microprocessor is super high speed too.  IS (Image Stabilization) works great: go ahead and breath during longer exposures, the pictures are sharp.  Prepare to be spoiled.

Title: Great so far
Content:
I've had the macbook pro for a few hours now and so far I am quite impressed. This is my first ever laptop, which I figured I would need after college. My last computer was a 20 inch intel iMac that was pretty darn fast - but certainly not as fast as this laptop is.
I am most impressed with the speed of spotlight and programs in general.
The only con - and I can tell it is something that will upset me over time - is the sharp corners (those formed where the keyboard surface and side meet), and by sharp I merely mean annoying on the wrists when typing. Luckily I will be using a 24 inch screen and seperate keyboard and mouse most of the time so this shouldn't be too bad.

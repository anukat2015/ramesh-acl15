Title: hate the cover
Content:
I liked the idea of the thermos,  but was very disappointed.  The top of carafe is very hard to get on and off, and when  pour cup of coffee, it often dribbles all over.   Would not recommend and will probably buy something else and get rid of this one,  It is not worth starting the morning frustrated before I even get a cup of coffee.

Title: This is the 1!
Content:
This is the Ipod Killer.  Apple makes a good product but this is better!  And here is why:  first, you do not have to monkey with Itunes with this product.  Creative has no website where they try to sell you music.  It is simply a great player and Creative realizes that its only job is to play music and videos - nothing more.
     Also, the Creative player includes a radio, which is a $50 add-on with the Ipod.  It also includes a recorder which is another $50 add-on with the Ipod.
     Furthermore, the Creative player is capable of using all file formats.  Apple is very limited and only uses MP4's for video.  I did not want to spend a lot of time converting files, which I would have had to do with an Ipod, so now I can play movies instead of wasting time converting them. 
    Also, the picture quality is much better on the Creative since it is a high-definition screen.  Finally, I believe the sound quality is better as well.  In short, the Creative offers everything the Apple does not.  It plays almost all files, and does not try to sell you songs or limit what files types are downloadable.  And it does all this for Forty dollars less than the Ipod!

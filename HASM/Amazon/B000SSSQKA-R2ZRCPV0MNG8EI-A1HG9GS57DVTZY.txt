Title: worst vacuum ever
Content:
i could vacuum 5 times in a row and still see things on the floor.  sometimes it doesn't turn on.  i have to his the "retract cord" button and then the power button quickly and then it sometimes works.  sometimes it just doesn't.  i HATE this vacuum.  it's not very old, and here i am shopping for another.  btw, the bags are too expensive too.

Title: Easy to fill with water and keeps coffee HOT
Content:
This coffee maker was bought as a replacement for a different Cuisinart coffee maker. We got tired of spilling water all over the counter when we tried to fill it. THIS model is great. There is enough space to pour in fresh water at a normal pouring rate. And, it makes great coffee. It keeps coffee warm for a long time too. The coffee stays in the top part of the unit and you can fill your cup with as much or as little as you need. It fits oversized coffee cups well. It keeps the coffee warm for a longer amount of time too. I supposed because it's insulated so well and not inside a glass container. I have guests at my home a lot and this is great because I can preprogram it to make coffee earlier than with my old coffee maker and the coffee will still be hot. Therefore my early rising guests can have a welcome cup of joe and the late risers (like myself) can still have one too. This model has become my wedding gift of choice. I can't recommend any other over this one. I suppose if you are a person who like to take a tall insulated cup on your morning drive to work, this might not work for you. But you'd be missing out on a great coffee maker. Oh yeah, this one is also really really easy to clean. 
In case you are curious, the old one we has was a Cuisinart DGB-550. It was horrible for filling with water. I don't know why manufactuers forget about the most basic things... like you have to pour water in it.

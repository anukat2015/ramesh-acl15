Title: Awful Unit - Noisy!!!
Content:
This unit is fine the first few hours of operation and then the condensation begins!!!  The unit fills with water after a few hours in the area where the wheel is.... sounds like a loud paddle boat in the room.  Spend the extra few dollars for the better machine.  This unit is NO BARGAIN!!!

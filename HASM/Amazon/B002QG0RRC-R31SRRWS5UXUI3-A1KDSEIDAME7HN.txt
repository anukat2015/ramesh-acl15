Title: WARM COFFEE
Content:
PURCHASED UNIT THREE WEEKS AGO AND UNIT WORKS AS DICRIBED EXCEPT CARAFE COOLS IN A HOUR.Company says that for small amounts two to four cups as I make for one person which is a mug plus you are better to purchase a glass carafe with the heated plate.It seems the excess air in the carafe cools the coffee rapidly so thermal carafe is not the way to go even if you heat the carafe under hot water it still cools in a hour or so.

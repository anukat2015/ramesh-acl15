Title: Broan fans are loud.
Content:
If you are looking for a heater fan unit that replaces your old Broan heater, this is it.
This heater fan is an exact match to its decades old product.
It fit the existing opening within a sixteenth of an inch.
However if you are looking for an improved product, this is not it.
It has the same loud fan noise as the old one.
It will require the same periodic cleaning to keep it running.
It will need to be removed annually to be cleaned and oiled.
For the price it is a good product and will last ten to fifteen years, but if want a quiet heater, pay moe and buy a unit with a better fan.

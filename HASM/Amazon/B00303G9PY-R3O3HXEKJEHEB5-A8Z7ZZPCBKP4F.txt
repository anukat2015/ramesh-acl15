Content:
Worth it, worth it, worth it!
I am the Goldilocks of Laptop Buying, (always finding one that is "too much this, not enough that") and i have GOT to tell you i have FINALLY found one that i cannot complain about!  Every single thing is great about this laptop.  I love, love love it!  There is way too many things to list about how great this laptop is, but i would be happy to answer any questions about it.  I have read every single review and researched this model to the hilt, and i feel qualified to tell you all that i know, and if you'd like to email me regarding any questions about  what it can do or can't do, i will tell you, and if i don't know, we will boot up this baby and see what we can find!"

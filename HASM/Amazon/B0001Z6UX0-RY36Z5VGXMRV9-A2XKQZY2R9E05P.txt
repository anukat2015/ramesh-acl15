Title: Product is questionable?  Service poor.
Content:
We bought this heater on 12/05 and brought to authorized repair center in 2/06.  We called repair center several times and were told that the needed part had to be ordered from Italy.  9/06, service center told us that the needed part is unavailable.  We called Delonghi parts center and were told that they will contact Delonghi corporate office and some one will call us.  That was last week.  We contacted them again today (9/19/06)and got the same reply.  We are very close to giving up our effort.  Lesson we learned is not to buy appliance on line.  At least we can always bring back the broken item to local store.

Title: A Nice Computer
Content:
In the world of cheap laptops this is not a cheap machine.  This is my 4th large screen HP laptop and by far the best.  A faster processor, beautiful 1080p screen, increased RAM, larger hard disk, and blu-ray/DVD drive all enhance the user experience.  Improved shell design eliminates the visable wear problems associated with the earlier HP laptops.  Cooler operation negates the need for a lap pad or lap cooler.  Overall, it is a very nice laptop with reasonable battery life and weight.  Certainly not a light weight but not too heavy.  I would prefer Windows XP over Vista but have found only one program that will not run under the installed Vista Premium (64 bit) operating system.  Regardless Vista improved significantly with SP1 and is not nearly as difficult as it was originally.
Initially I was hesitant to purchase from Amazon due to errors in the product specifications information (the screen resolution information was in error).  In the end, after looking at numerous internet sites, Amazon had the best price.  I opted for the super saver shipping and the computer was delivered within a week of purchase.

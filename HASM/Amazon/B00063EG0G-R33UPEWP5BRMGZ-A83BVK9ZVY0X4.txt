Title: 5 Stars, only if...
Content:
This unit is quite nice to operate, software is good. But when the battery gets low, there is no warning before the unit just freezes with backlight on; you can't turn it off, you can't charge it, you can only wait...days...until the battery finally dies from drawing power to the backlight, then it can be recharged. If it weren't for that, I'd give it 5 stars. But alas, it gets just 1 star due to that, and a return for refund.

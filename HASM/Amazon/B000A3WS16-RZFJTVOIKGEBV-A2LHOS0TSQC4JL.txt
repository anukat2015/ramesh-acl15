Title: If I send them back my lemon - maybe I can get an apple...
Content:
Oh where do I begin? This is my third apple in three years. I can not believe that I keep getting the only defective ipods out there so how come there are so many happy ipodders? 
First and foremost the customer service for this company sucks. Their website product service request form would not accept my Canadian postal code (maybe this whole thing is a Canadian problem). When I finally got a customer service rep on the phone I was told that they needed me to give them a different postal code. I explained I didn't have another postal code and the CSR suggested I give him a neighbours postal code. I told him One - that I did not know my neighbours postal code and Two - how would they get it to me if I gave them the wrong info.
To make a long story short, they were horrible on the phone, refused to forgive the $45 shipping charge (which is ridiculously high) even though I have had this thing for six months and days.
I am so fed up with this company. I now know why they never were able to take over the computing world. ANything more serious than some entertaining music and apple couldn't hack it.

Title: Not the way to start your day
Content:
What a disappointment. One time the water will come streaming forth so fast the espresso is too diluted; the next time, after trying to pack down the coffee only so slighty so as to cut the pace, not a drop will come out. Tried different coffee grinds--some more, some less coarse. Same result. A waste of money, and an easy way to get into a bad mood first thing in the morning.

Title: Excellent value for money
Content:
I was looking for a laptop with at at least 4 GB RAM and more than 2 Ghz processor but had a budget constraint of $ 500+/-50 For that price, it doesn't get any better than this laptop. It boasts of a 500 GB HD AND Windows 7! So far, I've loved using it. The battery life is reasonably good. Good speakers and the numeric keypad is an example of efficient use of space.
On the down side, sometimes, it takes a little too long to "wake up" when it "sleeps". Otherwise, this is an excellent product.

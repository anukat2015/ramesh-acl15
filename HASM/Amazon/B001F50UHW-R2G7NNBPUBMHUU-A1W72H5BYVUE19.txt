Title: Not bad for music
Content:
This Sony player is not a bad little mp3 player for music, though dont't expect good results for audiobooks/podcasts.  It doesn't resume playback where you left off, so getting to the point you want in a long track is very frustrating.  Good sound quality, great size, nice looking player and nice screen.  Don't confuse this one (model is Sony 438) with the 6-series which has better podcast support.

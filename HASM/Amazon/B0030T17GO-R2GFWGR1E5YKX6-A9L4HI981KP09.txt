Title: Dead out of the Box
Content:
This is a high end model, I am surprised it came dead out of the box! 
I will have to return it tomorrow, 
Dell should work on their quality control with their Chinese made Dells. In the olden days Dell would test each laptop while loading on software, but obviously not any more.
Do not buy, chances are high (given this is a one off model) that others will be dead, or die soon. 
It looks pretty and very slick but for the $750 I paid it should work out of the box.
Bummer : ( I will look back at my old favorite Toshiba.

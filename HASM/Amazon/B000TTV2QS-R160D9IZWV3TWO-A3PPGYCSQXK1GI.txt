Title: Lasko Ceramic Electric Tower Heater
Content:
The reviews already posted before I ordered this wonderful product made this an easy decision. This heater is everything it is claimed to be; quiet, efficient, well-made, and has wonderful features such as auto-temp control, oscillation for broad dispersion of heat, instant heat rather than waiting for the room to heat up. It is easy to use and once set, needs no further attention. It even has a handy remote control! I would recommend this wonderful heater to everyone. The model I bought is the 755320 tower set. You really can't go wrong.

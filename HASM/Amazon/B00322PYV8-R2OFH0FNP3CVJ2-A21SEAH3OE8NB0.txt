Title: Great Purchase!
Content:
We now have two Vaios in the house, one is the last generation and this one is an i7. I love them both, though I do wish that some of the features on the previous generation (browse without booting) were available on the newer system.
In general, it's lightening fast. The only other thing that I would change is the distance and locations of the USB ports. I think there should be more than 2, and with them being right next to each other, using a air card can be difficult if you have any other devices plugged in.
I love the smooth screen - it doesn't show dirt or fingerprints easily, and for it's size the Vaio is actually pretty lightweight.
I was very impressed with how quickly Amazon delivered -- I received it less than 24 hours after ordering!

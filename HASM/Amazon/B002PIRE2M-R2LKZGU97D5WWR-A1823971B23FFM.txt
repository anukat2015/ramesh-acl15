Title: Great Little Laptop
Content:
The Acer 1410 is a great little laptop at a good price. After deciding to get a netbook I did a lot of research on the different brands to decide which one to get. The Acer 1410 met all my needs; better performance than your average netbook, larger screen and resolution, light weight and good battery life. The Acer offers all this while still maintaining a similar price to your average netbook. 
My final decision came down to between the Acer 1410 and the HP mini 311 with Nvidia ION. I chose the Acer because it has a better processor and I don't plan to use this laptop to do any gaming. So far I have no complaints, the Acer 1410 has met all my expectations.

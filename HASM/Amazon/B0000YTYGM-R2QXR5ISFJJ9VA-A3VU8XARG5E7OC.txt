Title: Slightly Fussy Lid, but the BEST Coffee-Maker I've Ever Used

Fussy Lid, but the Best Coffee Maker Ever!, April 23, 2005
Reviewer: R. Wilner (Metro Detroit) - See all my reviews
    
I wish Amazon had 1/2 stars, because I would have given 4 1/2. I almost gave it a 5 star rating, but the lid may bug some people. I will admit that the lid MUST be placed in a perfect position, but how to do it is no mystery. Clearly etched in the top of the lid are the words "Open" "Close" and "Pour." If you put the lid on so that the word "Pour" is directly over the spout, it's no problem. When you go to screw on the lid, just make sure that the word "Pour" starts out over the spout and when it's closed, it will end up there. No big deal. My guess is, the people who have given negative reviews about the lid were impatient with it. 
My reason for buying this coffee-maker was the 12-OUNCE thermal carafe. This was one of the only coffee-makers I saw with a 12oz carafe as opposed to an 8 or 10 ounce. This was a huge selling point for me. As someone who nurses a whole pot a coffee a day, I also was attracted to the fact that I read it keeps coffee hot for so long. 
I have had the coffee-maker for over a month now, and I am NOT disappointed! I have not had one single overflow incident and I have had no problems. I suspect that those with overflow problems overfilled the reservoir or didn't pay attention to how they put the lid on. 
One thing I must share with those of you considering this coffee-maker. One day I made a pot of coffee and I forgot about it. The next day, approximately 36 hours later, I remembered I had made coffee the previous day, so I figured I'd pour a cup and microwave it. Microwaving was unnecessary. The coffee came out STEAMING hot. As if I had just made it! I'm sure the more coffee that is in it the hotter it will keep but this was over a day later! 
I HIGHLY recommend this product! 
PROS 
-No heating mechanism. No burnt tasting coffee! 
-Once coffee is brewed, the coffee-maker shuts off. 
-Coffee stays warm for much longer than the description states 
-The carafe stays cool on the outside. I make a pot and just bring it into the living room with me, or to my desk. 
-Very aesthetically pleasing design. Looks great in my kitchen. 
-A full 12 cup coffee-maker. A rare thing amoung thermal carafe coffee-makers 
-LED Clock/Programmable Timer. Auto Seal. Brew Pause Feature. Automatic Shutoff. Available in different colors 
-The water level indicator is easy to see 
-The beep letting you know the coffee is done is loud (I like that) 
CONS 
-You do need to pay attention to how to put the lid on, but it isn't exactly rocket science. 
-The digital clock area is tiny. But read the directions and using the timer is a breeze. 
-The stainless steel fingerprints easily, but that's not unusual in a stainless steel appliance. 
-The beep letting you know the coffee is done is loud (Some may not like that)

Title: This is one great camera!
Content:
I finally gave up on film, reluctantly, like the old guy that I am, surrendering my Nikon after playing with my brother's Canon 5D.  The 5D Mk II is an amazing camera, and if there were ever a question about digital having finally surpassed film, the answer is in.  The images are crisp and gorgeous, and the camera has all the flexibility anyone could every hope for, and then some.  The controls quickly become familiar and convenient, and the low-light sensitivity is astounding.  
That having been said, there are some notes I would make.  It is built like a tank, and when matched with an "L"-series lens like the 24-70mm or 70-200mm is significant in its mass.  In addition, the video images, though beautiful, must be further processed before they can be used in many video-editing programs (I use Vegas Pro 8.1), and I ended up having to purchase CineForm's NeoScene at about $100 to make them usable.  It almost seemed as though Canon's video people weren't consulted fully on the video part of the camera.  Again, however, great images are obtained once properly dealt with.  
I am sure that in the near future, an even more amazing camera will be sold; for me, this thing is perfect, even though I had to trade with my wife big time to purchase it.

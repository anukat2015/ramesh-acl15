Title: Good buy for a good vacuum
Content:
I haven't used a cannister vacuum in years so there was an adjustment period but I am happy with the Hoover S3755. It works very well on carpet and floors picking up pet hair and dirt; very powerful. Emptying the dirt cup is not my favorite thing but it is easy to clean and it washable (unlike bags. I clean the cup over the trash bin in the garage; a minor inconvenience for the ability to start fresh the next time.
My only complaints are: (1) the small brush attachment pops off very easily; (2) it is difficult to use any of the attachments at the end of the long wand on items you may want to hold in your hand like a pillow; and (3) the filter cleaning brush is WAY to tiny for the job - I use a large old toothbrush.
It's much quieter than my old upright Hoover and easy to manuver now that I'm used to it. The dirt cup doesn't fill up too quickly for me now that I've used the vacuum several times and gotten rid of all the dirt and hair left behind by my old unit.

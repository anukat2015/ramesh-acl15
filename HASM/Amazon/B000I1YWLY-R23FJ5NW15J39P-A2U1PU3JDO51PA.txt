My parents have an Electrolux vacuum that is over 30 years old and running like new so I didn't hesitate to spend the money on this highly rated Electrolux product about two years ago.  This vacuum cleaner is a complete waste of money.  My first reaction when I got the vacuum was to return it because of the cheap plastic construction.  I chose to keep the vacuum because after all it's an Electrolux and they are the best.  Wrong.  In addition to the Wal-Mart grade plastic construction, the electrical contacts between the hose and canister required regular adjustment to keep the vacuum running.  Once the handle started falling apart I couldn't stand the constant tinkering with this very expensive vacuum.  It was much quieter than the 14 year old Kenmore vacuum that it replaced and bagless designs are great.  I am still using the Kenmore.  The Electrolux went out with the trash.

Title: excellent value
Content:
Have had this coffee maker for several weeks now and for me it has no downside. It's quite simple to use, the coffee is excellent,and the coffee is the hottest of any coffee maker I've ever owned (there have been many). It's not "scald the feathers off a chicken hot" like McDonalds,but it's close.Excellent product.

Title: Wonderful Laptop
Content:
My only complaint in my new laptop is that it will randomly (without warning) shut off (go to a black screen). At this time I am trying to trace the problem but have gotten no where. Other than that its a wonderful laptop for what I paid for it. My primary use for it is while I'm deployed to the desert.

Title: Limited Possibilities
Content:
After reading the positive reviews on this item, I was excited to mount this in my kitchen wall, which is located above the garage.  The floor of the kitchen, as well as the kitchen itself, gets quite chilly once the temperatures dip down into the 30s.  
While the kitchen dimensions are larger than the recommended 10x12', I was expecting it to make SOME difference in the overall temperature of the room.  According to my thermometer, which I located on the other side of the 14x16' room, it MAY have raised it one degree.  There's definite warmth coming from the unit, but I think for a heater to perform in a cold room, the warm air needs to MOVE into the room rather than loom a short distance around the unit, so to speak.
On the plus side, it is hardly noticeable.  It does get quite hot, so to keep my dog from burning her curious snout, I set a small gate I had handy in front of it.  I'm not sure if this is really necessary, though.

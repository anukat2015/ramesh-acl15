Title: Awesome! Just what we needed at work
Content:
And now I want one for my house! I bought this as a gift for my coworkers, because our coffee at work totally sucks. I got tired of lugging my coffee to work and trying to make due with a portable french press that always leaks grinds. Now, everyone either buys their own k-cups or collects money, gives it to me, and I buy it on Amazon for them. This coffee maker is one of the few things we all agree on - it is excellent. Working your way through all the different blends and brands is half the fun. As a side benefit, we're all wired up on coffee all day now, and a whole lot of work is getting done a lot sooner. :o)
It brews coffee fast and hot, and is ready to go for the next person in a matter of seconds. The unit is compact and fits in a small corner by the sink in our TINY lounge. The 3 size options lets everyone tailor the coffee strength to their liking. The programmable on and off setting shuts the pot down when we leave and turns it on for our arrival in the morning. The 48 oz reservoir is plenty big, and we just keep adding more when we go to make a cup. That's the one thing we were worried about - running out of water - but it just doesn't happen.
Even the non-coffee drinkers like the HOT water from this for their instant soup mixes, cocoa, etc. It sure beats microwaving water. People are saying they miss it on the weekend, and I'm one of them!

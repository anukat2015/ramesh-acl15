Title: Not recoverable after &lt;24hours
Content:
I bought this player and received it on a friday.  Loaded my music into it.  Listened to it some on saturday morning, but when shutting it off, the thing just froze up.  Now I have a glowing display and a nonresponsive player that won't reset with the paper clip through the reset hole and the computer won't even recognize it.  Waiting on an e-mail reply from Creative, but will probably have to return it unless by the battery burning out, the thing somehow resets.  Forget trying to find a 1-800 number on their site, and they are not open on weekends even when you do find it.  Most likely this thing is going back and I'll take my chances with another brand of player.

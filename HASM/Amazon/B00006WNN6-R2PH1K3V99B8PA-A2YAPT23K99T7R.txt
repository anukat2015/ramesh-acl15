Title: Works okay but not always
Content:
I bought this product late 2008 for office where the temperature is too low for me.  I like it...when it's working.  Some days the heater just wouldn't work.  I would unplug it for half an hour then plug it back again.  Sometimes that resolves the problem but most times it doesn't.  Also, it doesn't have a switch to turn it off so it must be unplugged after use for safety reason.

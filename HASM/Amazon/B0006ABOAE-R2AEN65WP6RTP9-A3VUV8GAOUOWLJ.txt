Title: Perfect
Content:
Does everything it's supposed to.  Easy to use, brews espresso and coffee at the same time, nice looking.  I haven't used the frother so can't comment on that.  Main complaint is the rubber washer in the espresso screw down lid comes off and has to be put back on with every use.  Otherwise I would give it 5 Stars.
I have since found out if you turn the espresso on and off it releases the pressure and the rubber washer is no longer a problem.  If I could change it  I would give it 5 stars now.  It's a year later and still perfect.
It's now 2010 about 3 years old and still perfect!  I'm thinking about buying another one so when they aren't available anymore I'll have it!

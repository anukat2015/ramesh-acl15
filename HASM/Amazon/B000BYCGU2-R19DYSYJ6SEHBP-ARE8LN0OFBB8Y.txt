Title: Overrated
Content:
Bought this after much online shopping and comparing, and really anticipated enjoying using such a fine machine. Am returning it. One key disappointment concerns the water chamber. It is awkward to fill with the carafe, and it doesn't show any measure for less than 4 cups of coffee. Making less than 4 cups requires guesswork or actually measuring water first and pouring it in. In addition, the numbers on the water chamber are impossible to read if you are over 40! Finally, we could overlook those issues if the machine produced fabulous coffee. But, even with high quality beans, coffee brewed by this machine was no better than that brewed in the free Gevalia machine we've been using for years.

Title: Great Coffeemaker
Content:
I wanted a thermal coffeemaker that would brew 12 cups of coffee.  After having read the reviews on different coffeemakers, I chose this one.  I have had no trouble so far of having the coffee filter plug during the brew cycle.  The filter basket is removable from the filter frame that it sits in on the coffeemaker.  This makes it easy to clean.  The carafe has a small opening which makes it more difficult to clean.  I am pleased with the coffeemaker and would purchase it again.

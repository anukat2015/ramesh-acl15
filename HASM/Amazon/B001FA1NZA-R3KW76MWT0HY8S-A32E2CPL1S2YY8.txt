Title: Not for runners
Content:
2nd Generation vs. 3rd Generation iPod Shuffle Breakdown:
The Weight: 3rd Gen weighs .38 ounces while the 2nd Gen weighs .55 ounces...  I promise you that you will not be able to tell the difference.  This catergory is a tie.
Controls:  3rd Gen puts the controls on the headphones cord (on the cord that goes to the right ear bud)... this could not be more annoying.  To say I hate this control system is an understatement.  The controls are so far up the cord that you can not see it when you are looking for it.  I can not state this enough I HATE THE CONTROLS OF THE 3rd GEN.
Space:  The 3rd gen hold 4 gigs of music,  apple has discontinued the 2nd gen 2 gig version so now all you can get is 2nd gen 1 gig...  I thought this was a big deal, but I use my shuffle purely for running, and 1 gig is over 12 hours of music!  needless to say, 2nd gen 1 gig shuffle is plenty.
Accessories:  I know this does not sound like much, but with the 3rd gen, you must use their headphones...  they are basically the same crappy iPod buds that fall out of your ear whenever you move that comes with every version.  Since I got my iPod Shuffle for running, buds are not sufficient.
Long story short, you don't need the 4th generation shuffle, it is a horrible product.  Get the 2nd generation 1 gig version, I promise it will meet most peoples needs.

Title: I like it!
Content:
I'm not one to make coffee.  I admit my husband spoils me when we enjoy coffee at home.  My problem was getting a good cup when I'm at work.  This personal coffemaker was just the perfect item I was looking for.  Based on Amazon consumer reviews (thanks Amazon, you rock) I picked this one and so glad I did.  So easy and very fast.  Even clean up is a breeze. I love that great aroma of fresh brewed coffee I get each and every morning in my office.  If I had to pick anything negative about this product, it would be that the mug gets pretty hot for awhile after brewed and you pretty much have to use the handle until it cools a bit.

Title: Just finished my second coffeemaker
Content:
I'm looking for a new coffeemaker, as this Cuisinart, my second one, has apparently shorted out. We used it daily for about two years, and I liked its features, but like its predecessor, ZAP and it's done. The first one lasted a shorter period of time, but was replaced by the store where I purchased it. I will not be looking for a Cuisinart brand maker this time.

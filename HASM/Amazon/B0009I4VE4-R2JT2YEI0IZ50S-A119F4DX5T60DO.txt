Title: Solid Camera
Content:
I'm a pro and can't find much to whine about. Nikon makes solid cameras and this is another...These cameras do have a tendency to purposely underexpose, in order to correct for any metering errors, this you can allow for by changing your iso or using the +/- exposure control. Read the manuals on these cameras very carefully, they can be very helpful. Buy 1 and start shooting.

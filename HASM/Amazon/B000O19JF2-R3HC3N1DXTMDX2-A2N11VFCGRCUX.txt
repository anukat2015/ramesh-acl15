Title: Great Camera
Content:
In my opinion, this is a great camera.  I took a photography class several years ago and have some experience with manual use.  Whether you have little or no experience, this camera makes manual use fairly easy, as well as has several options for auto use.  You can use the camera on manual but still use automatic focus.  It takes great pictures and is easy to use.  Great camera, highly recommended!

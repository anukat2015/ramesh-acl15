Title: Prone to defects, poor support provided by Creative
Content:
With all its bells and whistles, the Zen Vision M is an amazing alternative to an iPod--when it works.  
While not every unit is plagued with problems, many of them are...
A month after buying it, the FM radio spontaneously stopped working.  Well within the warranty, I sent it back to Creative for repair and got a brand new model a few weeks later.
Shortly after the year mark had passed (and thus the warranty ending), the unit randomly started malfunctioning--freezing up, displaying only a black screen, resetting wouldn't work, even formatting the hard drive didn't do anything.  Outside the warranty, the cost to fix it?  The same price as a new model.
Creative does not support their defective units.  All one has to do is browse the Creative forums to see how many other people have experienced this same issue...
Avoid Creative--get an iPod.  They supposedly last.

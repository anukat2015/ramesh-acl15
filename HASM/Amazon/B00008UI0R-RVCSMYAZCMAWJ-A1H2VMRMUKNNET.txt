Title: Too many parts
Content:
I have been a great fan of the Hoover line for many years, but I tried the Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel out and immediately thought that it had way too many parts to maintain solid suction. After assembling the parts, I noticed that the handle and tube section that lead to the roto brush were not connecting tightly. After numerous attempts to adjust this issue, I turned on the vacuum to see how it affected things. It did, the roto brush where the vacuum actually cleans the floor would not operate. I had to manually pull and hold tight the handle and tubing that contains the electronic connection just to get power to the roto brush. So basically it was delivered defective. When I went to return it to Hoover, they said to send it to a Hoover repair shop. Not the answer you want to hear when you had not even officially operated the unit.

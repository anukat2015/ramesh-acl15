Title: Nice unit, good cooling
Content:
Favorite thing is the price especially for a stainless steel product. The cooling ability is also rather impressive. I put it in my study/guest room which is about 225 or so squarefeet on a a hot summer evening, I would say 87F. and shortwhile later I was feeling extremely comfortable. It a slightly loud when on highspeed and is a awkward to lift vertically but other than that I am liking it plenty.

Title: Excelent camera - lens are 3.5 stars
Content:
This is my first digital SLR. I love it!
The camera has a lot to play (and learn) with. It has the latest technology from Canon. The live view doesn't seem to work as a point and shoot yet it may not be a deal breaker. The lens are so-so. By reading other reports one realizes that there are much better lens to replace it. The camera is light and no so bulky as other SLRs.
If you plan to buy a general purpose zoom it may not make sense to buy the body with the lens even at the cheap price difference (unless you want to sell it later).

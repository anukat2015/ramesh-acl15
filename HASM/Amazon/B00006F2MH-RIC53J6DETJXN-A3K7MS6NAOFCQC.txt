Title: Buy a Capresso instead!!!
Content:
I've been meaning to write a review on this for over a year.  My husband bought this for me, which I appreciate.  However, the grinder is louder than a plane!  The Capresso is much quieter than this thing.  Mine is a couple years old now, so maybe they've improved it?
I agree with much of Neurotome's review.  When Cuisinart tells you to rinse and dry each component they MEAN it.  If you do not, the condensation builds up in the grinder and it is full of water.  You will not be able to make coffee the next day without drying it out, including the chute, because the grinds will stick.  If you just choose to not use the loud grinder for a while, which I did, the moisture still builds up and you will get mildew.  I learned this the hard way.  I did not have any problem with the plastic parts warping, though, because I would never put plastic components in a dishwasher, since that would expose them to very high temperatures.
Seriously, unless you are willing to remember that once the coffee is done to: open the top, take out the grinder, pull the lid off the grinder, rinse both, let them air dry, open the basket, empty it, dry basket and its lid...don't get this thing.  You will have a loud mildew-fest.

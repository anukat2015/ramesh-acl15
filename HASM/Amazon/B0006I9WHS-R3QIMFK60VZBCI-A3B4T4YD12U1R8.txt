Title: Awesome little heater! Works like a charm!
Content:
This is the perfect little heater and I know space heaters as I own about 3 of them already. I use this one at work. We aren't supposted to have space heaters but it is soooo cold at work that I would be absolutely miserable without it. Because of the size, it's easy for me to keep this one out of sight. I keep it plugged in to its own surge protecting power strip so it doesn't ever disturb the other computers in the area. When I leave for the day, I can lock it up in one of my filing cabinets. I can't say enough good things about it. I love the thermostat feature, if I get too warm, it's easy to turn down. I just ordered a second one for my bathroom. If you need a tiny space heater that really warms you up, then this is the one!

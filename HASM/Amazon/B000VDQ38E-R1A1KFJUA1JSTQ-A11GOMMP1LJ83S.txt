Title: Would not recommend!
Content:
I bought this vacuum the very end of 2007. I live in a small 600 square foot apartment w/ 2 cats and vacuum once a week, empty it out every time after using, and check for pet hair on brush regularly. Since the time I bought it, the brush roll broke 2 times, as well as the rubber vacuum band, twice. I took it to the Vacuum Repair shop last week b/c it was making a louder than normal sound and smelled like something was burning and picked it up from the repair shop today. I just used it, everything working ok, until the brush roll breaks yet again.  I am fed up with this plastic load of junk and will likely be going to buy a real vacuum at the Vacuum Shop, which sells vacuums not available at mass stores. They said that all these vacuums you can find at mass retail stores are cheaper, but they are cheaper for a reason! I am so tired of dealing w/ Bissell people and my vacuum and I can't just go without a vacuum for a long time b/c of my 2 cats. The Bissell Pet Vac is a plastic piece of constantly breaking crap. 
If you want a lasting product that will not cause problems, go to your nearest Vacuum Repair Shop. The one near me have vacuums that cost a couple hundred and up (and are not sold by mass retailers), but they come w/ 5-6 year warranties and are recommended by vacuum expert

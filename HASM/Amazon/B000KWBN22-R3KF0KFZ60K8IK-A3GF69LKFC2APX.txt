Title: Heater shuts off too quickly
Content:
The heater was fine for a few weeks but then it stopped working properly. It shuts off after 2-3 minutes of working(it is not overheating) then will not come back on for another 5-10 minutes. When it does come back on it shuts off again in 2-3 minutes time.

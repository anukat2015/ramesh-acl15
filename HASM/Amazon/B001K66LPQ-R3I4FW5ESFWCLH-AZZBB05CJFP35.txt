Title: Good and Bad
Content:
I bought this unit as a replacement for my old Brew Station.  I was glad to see that they improved where you pour the water in, and the fact that you could set your brew to lite/bold coffee strength.  However, the fact that they put the spout all the way in the back, means that you have to tilt you cup in order to keep from dribbling down the side of the machine.  Which also means I will be taking this machine back to the store for a refund. By the way, because this model 48464 is so new, they do not have a permanent filter basket for it.

Title: Best Mp3 Player I've ever had!
Content:
I've had my Creative Zen for about 3 months and have never had any issues with it except that when I plug in my SD card with tons of music on it, the titles appear really strangely. The music still plays alright, though.
It is the perfect size to fit in a pocket and pull out whenever you need.
Please note, though, that creative has recently come out with a new Mp3 model, and I've heard it's pretty sweet.

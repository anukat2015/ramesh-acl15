Title: Excellent upgrade from 5G model
Content:
In one day of trying the new 80GB model IPOD, one can tell that the new model is well worth it.  It offers almost three times the space, for one.  It also is slightly smaller than the 5G 30GB model. There are also some features carried over from Itunes featured here, notably the coverview feature, which was rumored to either be in a firmware upgrade for current models or in the newer models.  Well here it is and it's a neat little feature.  Not highly neccessary, mind you, but fun to have on the ipod.  My biggest praise for the new model (besides the space, of course), is that there is a faster response time on it.  While the sleeker looking menus are nice and the games are cute (the music quiz one especially), it's the functionality that wins here.  This continues the tradition of Ipods in creating the most user friendly MP3 player on the market.

Title: I can type now without my fingers getting numb from the cold
Content:
this heater blows half the fuses in my house but that's because the electricity that runs through my house is old.  It's fine if I'm running it without a blow dryer on upstairs or the microwave.  It's really not that loud.  I use it in my office.  I've tried sleeping with it on in my room and I can do that but I'm too scared it's going to burn my bedroom because I only have a partial wall outlet (it's actually cracked).  I don't need a digital temperature display.  This one doesn't need or use that feature.  How it works is you turn it on full blast, heat the room up to how it feels nice, and then turn the dial down until it clicks and it will keep the room at that desired level.  It actually goes on and off intermittently like regular heat.  For 25 bucks this did the trick.  It's small too and you can use it with a proper extension cord.

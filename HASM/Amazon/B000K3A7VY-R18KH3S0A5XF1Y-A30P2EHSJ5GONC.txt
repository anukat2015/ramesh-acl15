Title: good machine
Content:
I have had my coffee maker for three years.  It brews quickly, mine does not leak, the coffee taste good, and it's attractive looking.    The only problem I have is that after a little over a year the coating on the burner started to chip away.  I am still using it this way.  I tried an expensive Cuisinart, and returned it two days later.  The coffee was bitter and it brewed extremely slow.  I will be purchasing another Mr. Coffee.

Title: 80 gb entertainment center
Content:
The 80 gb ipod is awesome. I have over 3500 songs,900 photos, 2 audio books and 3 movies on my ipod and its only 1/4 full. I have no complaints.
I've read other people's reviews and some complain about the slowness of the cover flow art. I don't know what they are complaining about because mine is quick as lightning!  I would recommend this product to everyone.

Title: Rinse and shake or it will overflow!
Content:
Very attractive unit; looks nice on the counter. I like the carafe; it pours without spilling and empties all the way to the bottom, unlike the previous brand I was using. 
To address the problem of overflowing: I have overflowed it numerous times, and it was always my fault. It has never overflowed when I used it properly. The first few times were because the little ball in the lid was stuck. Rinsing the lid every time after I use it has solved that problem. Just give it a shake to make sure it rattles, and I never forget to do that now. The other times it overflowed were when I forgot to screw the lid on and once I even forgot to place the carafe in place. Sometimes I'm not completely alert before I have my first cup. Being terribly absentminded doesn't help either! My biggest complaint is the hard to read water level indicator. Didn't anyone but the designer look at that? I made a mark with a Sharpie at my usual level, but I shouldn't have had to do that. 
I like the unit very much and am not sorry I bought it. I like being able to have the coffee flow directly into the carafe to keep it warm and not have to leave the hot plate on. It's very convenient to have the coffee next to my easy chair as I read the morning paper. I even put the creamer in the carafe before brewing. Then I can just pour out what I want without having to mix the right amount of creamer. It's a beautiful product, especially the short carafe. And it makes good coffee. I do think the price is too high and give it just four stars for that, and the water level indicator.

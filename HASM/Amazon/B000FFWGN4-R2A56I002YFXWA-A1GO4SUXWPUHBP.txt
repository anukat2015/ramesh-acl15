Title: great vaccum worth purchasing with a few compliants
Content:
I really love this vaccum cleaner.  It's heavy but I believe that's what makes it so good.  The removable canister is great for cleaning the stairs or your car.  The pet eraser attachment works great on pet hair.  I have had to take the attachment appart a couple of time because the gears got messed up with all the hair inside.  You have to clean it out sometimes.  The cord is nice and log but twists up a lot and gets wrapped around things to easily.
Otherwise great product.

Title: Poorest Customer Service Ever
Content:
I needed to return a Dell computer based on their &quot;so-called&quot; customer satisfaction guarentee. I have now spent 3-4 hours on hold, been hung up on twice, and have talked to approximately 10 very friendly but completly unhelpful Dell customer service employees, none of which seem to speak english as a first language, who have bounced me back and forth from department to department. The only time I actually got through to the Returns Department......their computer was down! Absolutely the poorest service i've encountered in the electronics industry. BUYER BEWARE!

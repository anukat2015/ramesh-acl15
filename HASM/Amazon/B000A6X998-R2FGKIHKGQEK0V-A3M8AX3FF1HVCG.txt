Title: Better than I had hoped...
Content:
We had tried several different heaters to heat our family room with less than satisfactory results. We went through several oil filled heaters. They provided some heat, but very localized...not spreading throughout the room. They also seemed to fall apart after a couple of years.
A neighbor had one of those expensive EdenPure heaters that is quartz based and she is very happy with it. We couldn't spend that kind of money and it also takes up too much room. I searched and searched finally finding this one reviewed in Consumer Reports. I always like to get another opinion as sometimes I find Consumer Reports wrong.
We too the plunge and couldn't be happier. It makes a little vibrating noise when it comes on [sounds sort of like a fan on low]. That stops in a minute or two. What's the best is that it seems to push the heat out into the whole room.
In conclusion, it's not the prettiest unit, but more than does the job for us. We may actually buy another for the garage to replace an older unit.
Good choice.  Bill in Seattle

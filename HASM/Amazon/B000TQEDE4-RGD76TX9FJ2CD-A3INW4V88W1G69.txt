Title: Third One is a Winner!
Content:
Amazon has been excellent in providing customer service on this item. I am now on my third Cuisinart coffee maker within two months and it is working like a charm. The first arrived with a badly broken plastic carafe handle, due (IMHO) to poor manufacturer packaging. Amazon promptly replaced the entire product. The second unit arrived and exhibited faulty electronics, operating intermittently. Again, Amazon promply replaced the entire product. The third unit arrived within days and has been working perfectly for several weeks. I am very pleased with this unit in every way, but am cautiously optimistic that it will provide adequate service for several years. Three units are a small sample, but if two of three Quisinart products that are newly unboxed are defective in some way, the company will struggle to survive.

Title: Almost good til the last drop
Content:
I was given a 12-cup coffee maker as a housewarming gift.  Although it worked nicely, I live alone and found that when I made a half-pot, the coffee never came out quite right.  It was also a pain to clean.
I love the Cuisinart 4-cup because it makes the perfect amount for me to have a large mug while I'm getting ready for work, and then take the rest with me in a travel mug. The coffee turns out great every time.  It is easy enough for me to clean and set up during my morning (pre-coffee) stupor.  It doesn't take up a lot of space on my counter.
The one drawback of the product is that it has a 30-min automatic shut-off feature.  On weekends, I take a little longer to make it through the pot, and often it shuts off before I've finished all of the coffee.  The stainless steel carafe does not keep it as hot as I expected (I was expecting it to be thermal, but I suppose that was my own misconception).
On the other hand, the auto shut-off has saved me from many a burned carafe, so I would say that is only a conditional flaw.

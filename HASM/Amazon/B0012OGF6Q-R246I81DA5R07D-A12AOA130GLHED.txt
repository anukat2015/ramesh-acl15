Title: Great, Versatile, Easy to Use Digital Camera
Content:
The Nikon D-60 is a great camera; lightweight, full featured, easily understood menu functions, easy to operate, produces high resolution pictures, just a delightful product! Somebody actually spent time on the menu functions; on many cameras they are somewhat difficult to follow and seldom logical. However, the D-60 menu is logical and easy to use. The monitor screen is large and bright, easily viewed even in bright sunlight. I'm not too sure that I like the degree of automation, I like the focus brackets in the center of the viewfinder and find it a bit perturbing when the focus jumps to one of the side brackets. There must be a menu item that addresses that to restore control to the user! Great camera!

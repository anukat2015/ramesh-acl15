Title: Best Coffee Ever--Hot and Delicious!
Content:
I've been wanting this coffee maker for a long time. I was concerned about the review that said the coffee wasn't hot enough, but since I have two friends with this machine and they love it, I went ahead and bought it. I'm so glad I did! Not only do I love the look of this coffee maker, it makes the best coffee I've ever made at home! I think the water filter makes a big difference in the flavor. Since I was concerned about the temperature, I set the Carafe Temp to High at first, but found that the coffee was actually too hot--the Medium setting is perfect, and keeps the coffee nicely warmed for the entire four hours I keep the pot on. We grind our own beans, and I have not had any trouble with the grinds overflowing. I have also not had any trouble filling the pot with water--but I'm 5'6&quot;, so I'm tall enough to see into the reservoir while I pour. I also like that it has a three year warranty--the last coffee maker I bought (a Black and Decker) cost a lot less, but it didn't last a year. Bottom line: I'm thrilled with the Cuisinart, and am very happy to finally own it. It's an investment in great coffee--and I'm worth it! Treat yourself, and get it today!

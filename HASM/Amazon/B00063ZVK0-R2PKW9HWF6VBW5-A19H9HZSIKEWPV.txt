Title: The best electric heater, but lasts less than a year
Content:
Extremely pricey for what it is, although it works well.  BUT, after less than 4 months of use, it blows warm for 3-4 minutes, then the heater element switches off and it blows cold air.  This is just poor workmanship.
It was used to boost the heat a little in a small bathroom, and only for about 15 minutes in the morning.  I purchased it last February.  
If you like to gamble and are made of money, buy it! You'll love it, as many other reviewers have, and you may get lucky.  But for my hard earned money, I'll get something a little more solid such as a milkhouse heater next time.

Title: Had mine for years, keeps rocking along, nice even heat
Content:
We have a large eat in kitchen.  The dining area is surrounded by contractor grade windows, and the area has one less heating vent than it should.  When the outside temp drops into the low 20's, we turn on this heater and let it run overnight. The leaky windows combined with the heat coming off this "radiator" style heater make the whole kitchen and connected den area quite cozy.  The house furnace actually runs significantly less like this.  We use another one outdoors in a cold weather shelter for our dogs. It will add 10-15 degrees (depending on wind)in an uninsulated space.  
Both heaters have seen extensive use over 15 years and have been utterly reliable.  I would not depend on this for an otherwise unheated area for human use but it's great for supplemental heat.

Title: Good Value
Content:
I bought the Heat Sweep Electric Heater in October 2006.  The heater heats well for such a small unit.  The heat is spread very evenly through out the room.  I really like the unique sweep feature.  The fan automatically adjust to a lower wattage when the room reaches a comfortable level.  The heater is very quiet which makes it very good for use in a bedroom or any room.  Good Value for the money.  Johnny Newell

Title: Great build quality and performance...fantastic value!!
Content:
I too bought this laptop at Best Buy on Cyber Monday.  There were only 2 left in my entire area.  I was very lucky to pick it up for $649 plus tax.  This laptop is AMAZING.  I was drawn to the fantastic keyboard because I have large hands.  I could never get used to a standard laptop keyboard.  The keys resemble Macbooks.  This machine has gone beyond all of my expectations.  I had it optimized at Best Buy to remove unwanted trial software.  Even at the Amazon price this is a steal. Needless to say, Best Buy sold out immediately and are featuring the $1000 FW Series with Centrino processor and Blu-Ray drive which I did not find the need for. This laptop is extremely well made with magnesium case and fantastic wide screen high resolution.  Did I mention it has Windows 7 and 500gb hard drive.  Intel Core 2 duo processor and ATI Radeon graphics. This is by far my best purchase in a long time...and best of all it is a Christmas gift.  I watch my Netflix movies on it and connect it to my flat screen tv via HDMI cable. The picture is unreal!!  If you don't need Blue-ray and can live with a quality product with great portability and fantastic looks, I would highly recommend that you don't pass this up.

Title: Pretty Sweet
Content:
This vacuum is exactly what I was looking for.  It delivers on everything its description says.  
Some positive aspects:
1.  This is the quietest vacuum I've ever had.
2.  There is a brush included to help you clean out the filter.  I'm sure this prolongs the life of the filter, and the vacuum.
3.  The variable speeds are awesome.  I would say I use it on High 50% of the time.  It's nice to have options.
The only reasons I'm not giving it 5 stars are these:
1.  Bagless vacuums are always a bit messy
2.  There is no convenient location on the vacuum to store the attachments/accessory heads
3.  The little plastic piece that allows you to attach the wand to the canister to store upright broke off after 3 uses.

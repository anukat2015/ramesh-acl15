Title: A good one
Content:
If you are interested in a quiet radiant heater, this may be a good one for you to consider.  I set it up in my office, a room that is 18x16 feet and it heated up the room nicely.  It does take more time for this type of heater to heat up a room than a fanned heater would, but the peace and quiet is worth it to me.  I've got mine set up on a timer to turn it on and off automatically (it's so quiet, I forget it is there!).  This heater is also portable and I do move it around the house when I know I'll be sitting somewhere for a period of time.
I do like the product enough to order a second one.  From my perspective, the only thing missing on this heater is a small quiet fan (perhaps one that is powered by the heat itself!), plus a built in timer.

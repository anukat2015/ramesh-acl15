Title: Sleek netbook with a very low profile
Content:
The netbook was a gift for my 10 year old.  I wanted something very portable, but with enough screen size to make it usable as a primary computer.  For her it is perfect.  Battery life is great.  This netbook is flatter than my 10.1 inch acer.  I was most amazed with the keyboard.  I can't tell I'm typing on a netbook. The keys are as big as any of the other 3 laptops that I regularly use.  You get a lot for the price.  The processor seems fast enough for most applications.  Wouldn't edit video with it, but as far as simple editing of pictures and viewing video on youtube, it is great.  We've only had it for 3 weeks so I can't speak to how well it will hold up, but for now I will tell you that Acer hit a homerun with this one.

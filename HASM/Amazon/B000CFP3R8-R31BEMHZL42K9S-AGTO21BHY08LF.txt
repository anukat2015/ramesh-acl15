Title: Toastmaster TCM4W TCM4B is GREAT, and ...!
Content:
I have been searching for a GREAT 4/5-cup coffeemaker, to replace my excellent old Braun KF-400 10-cup (the newer Braun's... brew way too fast,  for full flavor extraction!)? 
-I burr grind gourmet beans, filtered water..., and want a GREAT cup of coffee!?
I first tried the Black & Decker DCM500B 5-cup coffeemaker, & was VERY UNHAPPY!-  bland flavorless, SLOW, MESSY basket paper filter (removing it is a mess!)..., coffeemaker!-
There is a reason the B&D's  sooo slow/tasteless!- It's the large-diameter "basket" type filter!
 Even with a shower head (sprays only about the size of a .50 cent piece)- the grounds on the sides "slowly" get wet, & are hardly strained for flavor (shut it off after brewing two-cups/look- you'll see 75% dry grounds!)!
-Most ALL Top-Rated gourmet coffeemakers, use the smaller-diameter CONE "paper" filters (more water contact...!).
-! Paper filters also remove heart-UNhealthy chemicals!- 
"Use no-hole unbleached (Oxygen bleached is ok) paper filters when brewing your coffee. Kahweol and Cafestol, two substances in brewed coffee, can increase cholesterol levels! Paper filters trap both of these. Skip the espresso and other unfiltered coffees!"!
____________________________________ 
I Googled (many days/hours, and tried several brands) for a GREAT 4/5 cup coffeemaker, that uses "CONE" filters?-
I finally found the EXCELLENT Toastmaster TCM4B!
Toastmaster TCM4B 4-Cup Automatic Drip Coffeemaker, Black
TCM4B Pros-
- #2 CONE filter that makes a GREAT cup of flavorful coffee (pre-wet basket, handle down, press/fold smaller sides flat...)! 
- Shower head!
- Brews 4-cups (2 USA mugs) of HOT coffee, in about 6min (optimal grounds contact time!)!
- No-drip carafe ( If you thumb-up the lid, & pour medium speed)!
- Pause & pour (20 seconds max!- hold basket in with thumb, & lift up back of carafe...).-
- 1 ¼ tbs. grounds per cup, for medium strength coffee.
- Longevity!- I read another user review where they had "happily" used it 4-times a day, for 2-years!
- I had good results with the Kroger natural brown/un-bleached paper filters!
- Be sure & wash ALL parts in HOT soapy water to remove oil release film. I also put 1/2 cup of white vinegar in first break-in pot, along with an empty filter.
IMPORTANT CLEANING/USE TIP (all brands!)!- The TCM4 had REALLY different cleaning instructions (not just this!)!- Big note to let it cool 10min between pots!!! Every coffeemaker I've had go bad on me, was shortly after I had poured cold water into a still hot pot (sizzle...)! 
Cons-
- "FULLY" Insert caraffe, "AFTER" you close basket!- or leaks all over!
- This is not Heavy Duty, and probably un-suitable for a big office... I would never put any of the parts in a dishwasher! It should last long with lots of TLC!?
- On-Light is on the side.
- Does not come with any #2 cone paper filters- Shop ahead (I trimed 1" off a #4).

Title: Hazzardous!!
Content:
I bought this heater last fall and it worked fine throughout the winter. Kept the family room comfortable. Went to use it this fall and when I first turned it on it smelled funny and then a few minutes later it burst into flames!!! Unsafe and scarey!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DANGEROUS HEATER!!!

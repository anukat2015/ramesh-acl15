Title: Received a returned item
Content:
I bought this little heater because of the reviews and the free shipping from Amazon. When I took it out of the box it appeared not to be factory fresh ..The plastic wrap was all bunched up and packaged un-professional.. as if someone had maybe purchased it and sent it back for being defective or just didn't like it.
I plugged it in and the fan was loud and making a worrying noise. Then I knew I had bought a lemon or a returned defective item.
Amazon is taking it back and paying for the return shipping .. but it's still a hassel to have to box it back up a drive it to the post office . Amazon is a great place to shop.. but I received a returned item . Didn't like that very much!!! I will still shop with Amazon because of their customer service and return policies.

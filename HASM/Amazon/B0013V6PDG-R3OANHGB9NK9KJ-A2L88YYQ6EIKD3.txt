Title: FINALLY... my feet are WARM!!!!
Content:
Five stars is not enough for this product. If you suffer with cold feet, chances are your feet feel half frozen right now, because you are looking for a foot-warmer to buy. Right?  Well, look no further. Please don't be put off by the price. Yes, it is high. But your feet are freezing now (aren't they?), and will be until you purchase this product. It is a perfect width, especially for a person who is a little bigger than most. The unit has a hinge under it so you can rock it forward or back, so you can really sit comfortably with it for hours. I wear down slippers and use the low setting. However, if you wear shoes, the high setting will go right through the soles of your shoes and STILL keep you toasty. 
Another remarkable benefit of this product is the help with my knees. Because my feet and legs are warm all the time while sitting, I can stand up so much easier, and my knees (that need to be replaced yesterday) feel so much looser. I have easy access to the unit under the desk, so I don't need the optional high/low switch. It's right at my feet, so I just bend over.
This is WELL worth the price. Suffer no more.

Title: Stopped working after 3 weeks
Content:
I'm writing my review here, since the Amazon vendor I bought the laptop from, J and R Music and Computer World, never posted my review on their site.  The laptop worked fine for the first 3 weeks I had it; then, with no apparent warning, it displayed the "blue screen of death" while I was surfing the internet.  I could never re-start it, even in safe mode; nor could I re-boot the machine using the restore disc that I had burned.  The only option Acer offered for repairs was shipping the laptop to their repair facility in Texas, at my expense.  I spent $30 to ship the laptop to the repair facility; and now, two and a half weeks later, I still haven't gotten it back.  I'm kicking myself for not getting an HP.  At least with HP, you can take it to a local authorized repair facility and have it back in a couple of days.  I regret buying this laptop, and I would certainly not recommend anyone buy an Acer.  There's more to think about than just a cheap purchase price.  You also have to consider the level of coverage and service you'll receive after the purchase.  Stay away from this one!

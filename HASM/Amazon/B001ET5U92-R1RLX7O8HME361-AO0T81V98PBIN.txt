Title: Nikon D90...BUY IT FROM AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
I've owned Nikons since 1971 and D50, D70,D70s and a D80's before purchasing my D90.  Just by the way the D90 handles low light/high ISO conditions makes the camera worth the price!!!!  The improvement over the D80 is remarkable!!!!! I got really nice results shooting @ 3200 and H 1.0 (6400)!!! and this is shooting drag racing!!!!  Good prices and then add the ease of buying from Amazon..... I added the Satechi vertical grip battery pack which I really like so far....... That is a good deal too with the timer and remote that came with it...

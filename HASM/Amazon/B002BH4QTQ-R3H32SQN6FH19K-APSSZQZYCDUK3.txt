Title: Computer Review
Content:
I really like this computer...I had a Sony Vaio before and LOVED it but it was 5 years old and time for a change.  I was for sure that I wouldn't be able to find another computer that I loved as much.  But one of my friends suggested I get this one and it has not let me down yet.  The extra battery size took a little getting used to, and also added some weight, but I like that it props the computer up at an angle.  I also love the number pad on the side.  This computer is fast, has great sound and image, and the webcam works GREAT!  I've had it for a month or so and so far I have no real complaints!

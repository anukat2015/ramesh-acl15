Title: I am greatly offended by this product!
Content:
I find it quite offensive that apple would not include several operas (or at least arias) sung by the late Pavarotti. How dare they not pay homage to him in some small way? They could at least make the limited Pavarotti edition ipod. It's appalling that they would make a "U2" version of the ipod but not a Pavarotti version. I understand that it might have been a bit short notice, but this is important! The releases of products and movies were postponed after the Kennedy assassination, why isn't Pavarotti deserving? He's the greatest tenor of our time, Kennedy was just some democrat who thought he was a jelly donut and slept with Marilyn Monroe. I personally find it extremely disquieting that apple releases music playing devices without showing any respect toward music.

Title: A Very Expensive Fan
Content:
I didn't expect the AF-330 to cool a large room, a medium room, or even a small room.  All I was expecting was that if it was pointed directly at me, I'd feel cooler than room temperature air.  Didn't happen.
I tried numerous approaches--with cold water that had been in the fridge all day, with ice, next to an open window, even all of three--but the result was always disappointing.  I'm willing to bet if I had a temperature gauge there wouldn't be more than a 3 degree difference between air temperature and what was put out by the AF-330.  
Also, I think I have a realistic idea of what swamp coolers are supposed to do.  My friend has one that he bought at Lowes (can't remember the brand) which actually provides noticeable relief.  
On the plus side, I suppose the air does have a clean smell coming out of it.

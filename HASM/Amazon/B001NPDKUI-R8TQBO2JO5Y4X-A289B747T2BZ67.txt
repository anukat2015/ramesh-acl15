Title: Great laptop
Content:
I've been very impressed with this HP.  The build quality is superb, the design is clever and stylish, and the screen quality is excellent.
I have not attempted any gaming on this machine (yet), but for regular M$ Office stuff, and graphics processing this thing has handled them without issue.  This carries the 32bit version of Vista - not a deal breaker for most, but those who use VPN to connect to work should note that Cisco does not provide a 64bit version of their VPN software.
I had 2 other Acer laptops prior to this that had to be sent back due to faulty equipment and shoddily put together components.  No signs of anything like that with the HP.
The full number pad on the keyboard is a good addition, and the mic and webcam work well.
All in all a very solid laptop for the price.  [...]

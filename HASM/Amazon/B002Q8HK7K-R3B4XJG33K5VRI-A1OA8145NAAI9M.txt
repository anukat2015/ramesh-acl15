Title: Even BETTER Than the Venerable UL30!
Content:
A quick search of reviews of the UL30 reveals that a LOT of people REALLY like it. But, THIS model is even better than that.
The battery life is great. Windows 7 is great. RAM size is great. Hard drive space is great (though, I'm unsure why they partitioned it into two drives). Audio is good. Video is good (a widescreen 13.5-inch monitor doesn't make much sense). Keyboard is good (not as good as ThinkPad). Mousepad is so-so (the surface is nearly the same as the rest of the keyboard area - sticky).

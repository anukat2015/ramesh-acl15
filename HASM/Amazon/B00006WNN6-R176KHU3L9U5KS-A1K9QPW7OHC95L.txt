Title: Great value and great heater!
Content:
This is a great little area heater. It looks nice and clean, and good quality for what you pay for.  The only thing is, I don't know how to turn it off completely unless I unplug it.  Overall, it works fine and is a great great buy.  I looked for area heaters in Home Depot, Lowes, and Bed Bath & Beyond. This is the best value heater I found that also looks pretty nice too.  I just bought a second one after I got the first one!

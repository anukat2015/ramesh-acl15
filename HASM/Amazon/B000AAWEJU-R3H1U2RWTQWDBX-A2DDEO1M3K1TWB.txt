Title: Worth every penny & smart Euro style
Content:
As soon as you have this baby out of the box you know you've made the right choice. Solid, well-crafted, smart color, sophisticated but simple design...simply amazing. And that's not even having turned it on. You'll actually want to get your floors dirty just so you can pull it out and use it again. INCREDIBLE power, intelligently designed bags, awesome self-retreating chord; every element of this machine is carefully thought out and applied to its design. A+ all the way. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more and treat yourself to this machine. It'll outlive your grandchildren, and they'll love using it too.

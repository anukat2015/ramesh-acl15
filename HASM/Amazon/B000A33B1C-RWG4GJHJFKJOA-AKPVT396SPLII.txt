Title: Great for a well insulated 40' X 40' room with 10' celing
Content:
I am very happy with this unit. I did not get the strong smell that others complained about when you 1st run the unit.
I can feel the heat coming off the top of the unit easy.
I use it at 1/2 setting in a  40' x 40' room with a 10' ceiling and a bay window and well insulated walls and ceiling.
It took about 2-3 hours for the room to get almost comfortable at 3/4 setting the first night, but after that, I returned the next evening and had to turn it down to 1/2 setting. I have not tried to use the timer. I just keep it on at 1/2 power, and am very happy.

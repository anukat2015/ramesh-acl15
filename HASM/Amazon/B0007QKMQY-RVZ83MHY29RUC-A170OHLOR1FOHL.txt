Title: Body - 5 stars, Lens - 3 stars
Content:
The Rebel XT is a great camera, but the kit lens (18-55, 3.5-5.6) is just average.  The only negative thing I've seen in reviews about this body is that it's small and doesn't feel comfortable in your hand...to me the size is one of the main advantages.  I'm not a professional so the size enbles me to take it places like vacation, the zoo and birthday parties and not have to worry about the camera that I'm carrying dominating the experience.  This camera feels fine in my normal size hands.  As for the lens, If I could do it over again I would buy the body only and spend $300 on the 50mm f1.4 lens or for the same price as the kit you could get the body and spend less than $100 on the 50mm f1.8 lens and that would get you started until you could invest in the more expensive, high quality zoom lenses.

Title: Good Little Safe Heater
Content:
Pros: Safe - automatic shut-off and tip protection are very good and offer me piece of mind in using this in my nursery; Sturdy base design and low center of gravity will eliminate chance for tip over unless it is knocked over by a person or pet; Heat's up my 12x13 nursery very well; Quiet operation;  Maintains a pretty consistent temperature once you have it set properly; Stays pretty cool to the touch after being on for hours
Cons: Thermostat is labeled 1-6 (instead of by degrees), so you don't really know what temperature you are heating to until you have it configured properly, which is trial-based and took me a couple of adjustments to get it set right.
I would recommend this heater, but the next one I buy will have a digital thermostat that displays the actual temperature.

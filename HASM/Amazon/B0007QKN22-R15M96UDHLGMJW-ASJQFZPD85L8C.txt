Title: Awesome camera!
Content:
I bought this camera as a retirement present for my dad. After about 400+ pictures, I have to say this is one of the best digital cameras I've ever handled!
For starters, the default automatic settings give excellent results in most cases. Colors are vivid, white balance is spot on, and automatic ISO selection is OK. For the real enthusiast, the multitude of options gives something for nearly every situation.
As with any DSLR, shot composition is done exclusively through the viewfinder. This is not a limitation once you realize the advantages of optical correctness in shot composition. The RAW output comes in handy for print use of the shots.
Overall, a great buy!

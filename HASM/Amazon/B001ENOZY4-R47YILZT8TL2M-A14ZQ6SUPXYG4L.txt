Title: Awsome camera - brings life to pictures.....
Content:
I have owned many cameras like many of you including some of the latest slim designs - they are all great to carry around but I think one doesn't knwo what quality of picture unless one uses this beast.  It has given us more reasons to take picture and it excellent response time is a pleasure to capture real moments.  
BTW, I am not an expert but number of complements I have got for my pictures are mind blowing - we also took pictures along side experts in Disney world recently and it so turns out our pictures are order of magnitude better than what they could do......
Only downside of this beast is its size - carrying this around is not easy but for now we are choosing a great experience and output versus convenience......if money is not an object this is the camera to go for - both for casual photographers as well as for professionals...

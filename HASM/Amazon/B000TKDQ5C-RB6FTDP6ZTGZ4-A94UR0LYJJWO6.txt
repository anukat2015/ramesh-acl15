Title: worked fine but died after one year
Content:
I liked this little unit but it died after one year (used in winter months only). I didn't find the low setting very helpful (why bother) and I won't buy this unit again. I'm going for one with a 3 year warranty with hopes it is built better. Plus, with it under my desk at work for my cold feet, the remote on the more expensive unit will come in very handy because I have been bending over and cramming my head under my desk to turn this one on and off.

Title: every bit as good as everyone says
Content:
I got this camera at the beginning of Feb 2007, with plans to take it along for our family vacation President's Week.  It is my first digital SLR -- although I have had point-and-shoot digitals that I've liked over the years.  But this took the best pictures I have ever taken.  My kids -- 9 and 11 years old -- were able to take great pictures with it on automatic.  And it is as easy to use as any camera I have ever owned.  I can't say enough good things about it -- it actually makes me look forward to learning how to use the more advanced features.

Title: Good vac for the price!
Content:
Great vacuum for the price!  Great suction and pretty sturdy.  It is definitely heavier than I expected - much heavier than my previous Oreck handheld, but manageable.  All parts are good but not extraordinary, except that if you plan to use it to vac bare floors you will be disappointed with the floor/carpet attachment.  I just kept the one I used with my Oreck, so keep your old floor attachment if you have one.
It is very loud so be prepared!
Ultimately really good for the price!
PS:  It is HEPA ready but it does not bring the HEPA filter.  You have to order it separately for $25!

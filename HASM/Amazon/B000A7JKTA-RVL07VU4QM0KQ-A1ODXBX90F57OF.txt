Title: Can't put it down!!!
Content:
I purchased my 5D about 3 weeks ago and I am having a great time with it.  I had it up in running in no time and it is quite easy to use with very intuitve buttons/switches.  The 2.5 inch screen is a big plus and is pretty vivid and clear even in the daylight.  I was fortunate in that all of my old Maxxum (35mm)compatible lenses (Sigma)work just fine.  If you have old Maxxum compatible lenses I suggest that you contact the lens manufacturer to see if they will work with the 5D but if they will not, don't let that stop you from buying this camera. Nonetheless, I did buy the Konica Minolta 28-75 F2.8 lens with the 5D body which, in my opinion, is good all around lens for the camera.  While the battery has a very long life, I would recommend getting a second one so that you never run out of juice.  I would also recommend a minimum of a 1 GB compact flash card if you are planning to shoot at 6 mega-pixels.   I highly recommed this camera as the pictures will speak for themselves.

Title: Sony Vaio PCG V505BX Laptop Review
Content:
I am a computer programmer. This Laptop is small and has a lot of feature, but the video card only has 16 megs of rams. Which make you can not do anything with high graphical operation. My friend bought 1 of this laptop. She had reinstall another version of Win XP Pro. The Win XP keep freeze randomly. The freeze problem occur, because the video card rams are not enough to run Win XP with high graphical performace. So I don't really suggest this laptop to anybody, except people using this laptop to run linux or other os' without graphical interfaceRegardsReece Mak

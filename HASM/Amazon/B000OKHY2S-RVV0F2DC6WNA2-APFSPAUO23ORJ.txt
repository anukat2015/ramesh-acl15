Title: Air cooler - OK
Content:
The unit never turned on. When I called sunpentown, they sent me a document which I tried, but it still did not work. I sent them an email, but they kept quiet. By chance I tried to turn the unit ON with remote and it started working. The buttons on my unit do not work!
The air cooler hardly works! It makes the room more humid and muggy than before! I wish I could return this product and get my money-back!

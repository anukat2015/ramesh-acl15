Title: So impressive
Content:
Switched from the Canon Xsi to this, and the difference (for the better) is amazing.
Things I love about the D90:
-size is perfect, ergo is great, fits really nicely in the hands
-hi res LCD screen is amazing
- AF is very accurate, if a little slow (but I will take slower but accurate over faster and missed focus any day)
- interface is great
-lots of hard buttons on the outside (possibly too many?)
-high iso noise performance is outstanding
-top LCD is much better than having to solely rely on back LCD
Things I don't like so much:
-priced on the high end
- video is pretty poor, unless you are doing studio or very controlled shoots, and you REALLY know what you are doing (I have seen some amazing videos using certain lenses with the D90 video, but for the casual videographer, I think you will get much MUCH worse results
-Live View is almost worthless except maybe for macro situations.  Slow slow slow, and the screen does not move.  Sony has the best LV system by far on a DSLR imo.
-weight...though this is a MINOR pick.  It's really not that bad, but noticeably heavier than say a Canon Rebel or even the D80.  If the LV and video caused the extra weight, I would be upset! ;)
-almost overwhelming amount of customization and control.  I have read the manual a couple of times and still do not understand all the linked menu setting changes (you change something on one submenu and you might cancel out something else that you didn't want to)  This could also be a positive, but I am not sure I would recommend this camera to a first time DSLR owner.  I appreciate the amount of customization, but it does make the learning curve very steep.
Overall , I have to give it 5 stars for performing in spades in the area I bought it for: still pics using the viewfinder.  If you are looking for the best camera in this price range with that same criteria, look no further, imo.  I've tried a few and the D90 is by far the best.
I even like the kit lens.
 
UPDATE:  After almost a year of ownership, I am still amazed at the technical ability of this camera.  I STILL find myself shaking my head in disbelief after viewing a seemingly impossible shot in post.  This is a camera I will keep until it dies.

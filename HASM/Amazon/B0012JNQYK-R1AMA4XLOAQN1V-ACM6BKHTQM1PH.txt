Title: Nice Device
Content:
Got this little beauty a week ago. Great display and easy to use - two of Apple's strengths.  Initially had some problems purchasing the v2.0 software via iTunes (it automatically asks if you want the upgrade) - but it kept sending me to the registration screen which was submitted.  Eventually bought the software from the Apple store.  Other than that things are working smoothly - hope it stays that way!

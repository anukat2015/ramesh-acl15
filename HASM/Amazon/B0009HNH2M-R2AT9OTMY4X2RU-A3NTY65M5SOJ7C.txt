Title: Good suction when the belt...
Content:
The suction works good when the belt stays on.   A design flaw. Twice now in 3 months I've had to take apart the power nozzle and put the belt back on.   A real pain.   Also finding bags is difficult and expensive.   Wish I spent a little more money and got a Miele.

Title: Still a great camera and an excellent choice as a backup. Arguably a better deal than a Canon G11
Content:
The D40x has been discontinued, but it's still a worthy DSLR and should be considered by anyone who's looking for an inexpensive entry level camera or for a small backup camera.  The big difference with the D60, I believe, is mostly just the self cleaning mode.  The difference in price is at least 100 dollars.
As others have noted, ignore the excessive brand new price mentioned here.  
I use my D40x as my portable camera that I take with me when I don't want to risk damaging or losing my D90.  I've been considering buying something like a Canon G11, a large size point and shoot.  The G11 isn't really a pocket camera either.  While the G11 has lots of great auto features, it still can't match the manual controls of a DSLR and I'm fairly certain that the D40x can beat it in terms of noise and ISO usability.  I've taken night shots with the D40x at 800 ISO that came out great.
I wouldn't recommend the D40x to anyone who's looking for the best entry level DSLR.  Given its age and functionality, I think it's pretty much limited to those on a really tight budget or those looking for an inexpensive back up.  When you compare the manual controls and the ISO capability compared to P&S backups like the G11, it makes the D40x a good choice.

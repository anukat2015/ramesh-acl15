Title: Excellent camera
Content:
This is my first DSLR and I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I did a lot of research and had narrowed it down to the Rebel xsi and the Sony A330.  I ultimately went with the Rebel because its shooting speed (fps), my comfort level with Canon cameras (my point and shoot was a Canon), and because of Canon's excellent reputation.
What I like most about this camera is how easy it is to operate in manual mode.  Being able to adjust the auto-focus selection manually is awesome.  A nice bonus is the large LCD screen (larger than the Rebel xs).  It was important to me have a quality live view and this does not disappoint...although I thought I would utilize this function more, but actually prefer to use the viewfinder (mainly for the auto-focus points that are only visible in the viewfinder).  
I cannot say enough positive things about the Rebel xsi.

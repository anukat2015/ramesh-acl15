Title: Delonghi Dragon Oil-Filled Radiator works like a charm
Content:
I bought this heater after returning a similar refurb from Amazon that was in bad physical condition and missing a wheel (Amazon's return policy worked like a charm- I did not have to pay the UPS return!)..  This new unit has a 24 hour timer with off/on settings for every 15 minutes, can be set to turn on only when the temperature drops below freezing, and has other settings.  I have had it for less than a month and it is ticking away.  I bought it since I had other similar Delonghi units in the past that did the job and do not put a drain on the electrical bill.

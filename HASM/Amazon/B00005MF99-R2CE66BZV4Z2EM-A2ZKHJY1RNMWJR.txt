Title: Great Coffee Maker, Major Flaw
Content:
I purchased this Coffeemaker on the recommendation of quite a few "Coffee Experts" as one of the best low-cost makers around.
While I totally agree after a few weeks of use, there was one major flaw: The clock.
The clock WILL NOT keep time, it doesn't know how to cycle past 12PM, and after reading many other Amazon reviews, I'm not the only one. The minutes stay accurate, but it jumps all over the place on the hour. 
As for the positive stuff, there are many other 5star reviews that go over it all, which I fully agree with. 
I decided to return the product for a replacement, and Amazon was prompt with shipping the new maker. I received it the next day, only to have the same thing happen with the new one.
So, if you don't mind being unable to program and set the coffee maker to start on a timer, then I highly recommend the coffeemaker. However, if that's a selling point for you, I'd recommend you look into another one. 
I'm keeping this replacement as I just don't want to deal with the whole exchange process again and can overlook the missing "feature."

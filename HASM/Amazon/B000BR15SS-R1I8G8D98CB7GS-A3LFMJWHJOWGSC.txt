Title: No more steam burns
Content:
I looked a long time before finding this coffee maker. It is one of the few (if the only) that you can modify slightly so you don't get steam burns on the top of your wrist. We Americans have the unusual motor habit of bending our wrist in an unnatural way to pour something, so coffee pots are made with the spout 180 degrees from the handle. To be able to pour by rotating your wrist instead of bending it, you can loosen one screw and relocate the handle so is 90 degrees from the spout. You can relocate it right or left depending on whether you are right- or left-handed. 
It makes good coffee, too.
One caveat: Make sure you get the one with the straight vertical sided carafe and not the one with the tapering sides. You cannot modify the one with the tapering sides. Amazon uses both pictures for the same pot.

Title: Super strong suction and many good features
Content:
My Bissell bagless upright broke after less than 2 years and my cleaning lady recommended getting a canister vacuum.  I read Amazon reviews for many, including much more expensive brands, and chose this one based on overall value and the high number of positive reviews.  I just vacuumed with it for the first.  WOW!  Who knew my carpets were so full of dust!  I was truly amazed at how incredibly well it cleans.  Here are the pros and cons based on the first try:
PROS:  fabulous suction, base unit is not heavy and rolls easily, dirt cup is wonderfully easy to remove and empty, useful controls are right at your thumb, easy to vacuum under furniture, attachments are well designed, adjustable height for the handle.  
CONS:  power head pulls forward very strongly so takes some upper body muscle to pull it back and can be a bit hard to maneuver but not too bad, power head flops down when carried (but this same feature allows it to take up less space in my broom closet), dirt cup needs frequent emptying but takes mere seconds.
If it continues to perform like this, I'll be very happy with this purchase, especially for the sensible price of $180.

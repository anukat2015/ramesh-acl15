Title: I LOVE IT!!!! some problems with life span...
Content:
They keep breakin' & I keep buyin' 'em. ;) I love this little guy. It cranks. I want one for every room b/c my dogs worship them and live in front of them. You can push a button for Energy Saver on or off. It is cooler with it on, but that is nice for when it's not as cold out. I bought my first one at Bed Bath & Beyond & it is still crankin'. My second order from Amazon, via home (?) came with one broken. The other broke soon after. They replaced the one that arrived broken in a timely manner. So, now I have 2 that work, and need to replace the third. The good news is they cost less than the Vornado's, which ALWAYS break eventually, anyway. And, if they fall over, or get knocked over by a dog, they turn themselves off. I know I'm not supposed to leave them on when I leave the house, but I do sometimes. It keeps the dogs happy & content & QUIET. No problems there so far.The heater is also quiet, by the way. So, this is the heater for me. Much cheaper than running heat for the whole house, I think.

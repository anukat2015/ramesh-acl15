Title: I get a workout while I clean!
Content:
This is my first review ever! I could not wait to review this vacuum! This unit has so much power that when I first used it, it felt like I was walking a little dog that wanted to run....it works wonderfully. One shot gets the dirt up. I change the filter after every other use because it sucks up soooo much. My "CARPET" looks brighter.   I wish I could've found out about this one 5 vacuum cleaners ago. Highly recommend it.

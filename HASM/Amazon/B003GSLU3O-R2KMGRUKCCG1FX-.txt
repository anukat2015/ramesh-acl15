Title: Battery life not as expected
Content:
I had the macbook aluminum 2.0 GHz before and the new one is much faster, but the battery last less than 5 hours without bluetooth on and hard working processor or dvd on - I think this is a bit disappointing. The second thing is my old one never crashed, and the new one crashed for the first week already twice.

Title: iPod 30 GB video
Content:
What I liked - 
The looks!
Can't think of anything else!
What I didnt like - 
1. Its just an MP3 player. It doesnt have FM or a voice recorder. My creative MP3 player (Zen) does!
2. The video doesn't seem to play nomal formats like avi or mpg. You need to purchase a software converter to be able to play these formats!
3. Too expensive for a product with such low features
4. The iPod once hung when I connected it to my computer for charging. In my "creative zen", all I need to do is remove the battery and put it back in.. and I am good to go! But with the iPod, the battery is in accessible. So I had to wait for it to lose all its charge, so that it switches off on its own and then restart it!

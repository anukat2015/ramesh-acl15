Title: nano ipod 3G   8GB RULES!!!!!!
Content:
A FRIEND HAD ONE-HE SAID YOU WANT TO GET THE NANO IPOD 8 GB 3RD GEN. SO WITHOUT DOING ANY RESEARCH, I ORDERED A USED/LIKE NEW FROM AMAZON.COM. THIS THING ROCKS,THEY SAY YOU CAN DOWNLOAD 2000 (4 MIN. SONGS) WELL I'M A HARDCORE ROCKER WHO LOVES THE 60'S~70'S MUSIC. AND I LOVE THE LONG STUFF 6~10 MIN SONGS. SO I ONLY HAVE AROUND 800 LOADED AND MY CAPACITY IS ALMOST USED UP. BUT YOU KNOW,I HAVE SOME GREAT STUFF. HOW ABOUT RENAISSANCE-"ASHES ARE BURNING", THE 25 MIN. VERSION LIVE. YEAH, WHEN I'M ON MY GSXR 1000 TOOLING DOWN THE ROAD AND JAMMING. PRICELESS.  M.Z.

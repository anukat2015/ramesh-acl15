Title: Needs more features found standard in competitors
Content:
For a camera that offers PASM manual modes, it also needs manual focus for macro shooting, and pre-focusing on an area to capture fast action (like a skateboarder coming in and out of frame quickly). Also needed are custom white balance, variable JPG compression levels. and manual flash levels to optically trigger off-camera flashes. Kodak makes good value cameras, but it's these minor features that are lacking and come standard in competitors cameras that break the deal for me.

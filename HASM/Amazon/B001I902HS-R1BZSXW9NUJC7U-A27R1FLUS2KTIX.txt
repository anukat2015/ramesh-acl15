Title: Great vacuum, only one minor thing I'd change
Content:
I've been using Kenmore vacs for years, both uprights and canisters. This Panasonic is at least as good as any of those machines I've used, and in some ways, better. The only thing I'd change is the fact that a traditional floor-nozzle is not included; the existing power nozzle is used for floors. It does a decent job, but isn't as maneuverable as a floor nozzle, and doesn't get into tights spots. This minor omission doesn't prevent me from rating this model five stars.
All other news is good on this unit. Seems to be quality construction. It did the best job on my living room rug of any vacuum I've ever tried, picking up a heavy layer of dog hair on a single pass. It includes HEPA filtration, great for allergies. The power nozzle detaches with the press of a foot switch (and easily reinstalls), eliminating bending to remove it. It handles edges well. The power switch is on the handle, right where it should be. Highly recommended, especially for homes that are primarily carpet.

Title: second classic
Content:
When I left my classic iPod on the plane after a recent flight, I was quite upset.  You know how attached you can become to these things.  It was 2 1/2 years old and it was still going strong. Since I had to get a new iPod, I toyed with the idea of an iPod Touch, but realized, I really didn't need all of the apps, etc. and went for another classic.  WOW.  The battery life is 10 times longer than the old one and I don't think I can possibly fill up the memory on this new one, including with videos.  Maybe I subconciously "lost" my old iPod to see what I was missing with the newer version. Love it.

Title: Absolutely Perfect!
Content:
I did my fair share of research about vacuums after a consumer reports suggested vacuum crapped out after a year. I decided on this Electrolux 7020. I have no complaints at all. The vacuum works wonderful! It is very versitile! It picks up bare floors and carpeting with no problem. I like the On/Off switch on the handle, plus all the controls on the handle. I think I will stay with a canister vacuum from here on out. I've had it for a year and it's been awesome. The bags are more expensive and smaller but they do support hepa filtering. Very clean! Also, I guess there was an update to this model that's why they call it the 7020B. I guess they improved on some issues with the first generation model which was 7020A.

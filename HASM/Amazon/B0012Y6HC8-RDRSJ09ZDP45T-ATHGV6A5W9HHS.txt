Title: Amazing camera, price, and results!!!
Content:
I have had this camera for 5 months, since April 2008.  At first my results were inferior to those of my Rebel 300D images.  I  just assumed the camera would just produce better images! well it does, but you need to unlock its potential.  
The Canon XSi is a fantastic SLR for entry level digital SLR beginners/amateurs.  It allows your to have a light weight camera, that still can stand up to some abuse.  
It is possible to take over 1,000 images on a single battery charge.  The XSI has a peppy  3.5 FPS shooting speed so you can capture sport images at your local high school with ease and pride.   
When switching from a compact point and shoot to an SLR, there is a learning curve.  As long as purchasers realize they are not acquiring a more advanced point and shoot, they will on a better path to great photos.
As I said, there is a learning curve.  You need to learn about aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and how those combine to create an exposure and scene.  Furthermore, there are some nice customizations available by the XSi such as focus and exposure lock separation, spot metering for accurate exposure control, live view focusing (2 modes).
SLR photography is a fun and exciting challenge.  If you buy this camera, do not just use the auto mode!!!

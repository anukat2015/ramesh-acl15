Title: Another fine Olympus product
Content:
Camera specs are excellent for the price, I have an older very good E10, and Olympus has improved many things with this model, much lighter too.  I was looking for a camera with image stabilization in the body of the camera,  the sonic wave filter (like the E10) and one that had interchangable lenses.  I like the larger CF memory (so I can't lose it as easily), plus they are available with more capacity than SD cards.  I was hoping to re-use my  FL40 flash  but now I have to save for the newer FL50 to work with the 510.  I also was a little dissapointed in the small veiwfinder, but the LCD screen is now much larger.  The scene modes have nice explanations built in and will be useful and the program modes can be customized and stored.

Title: Best $149 I've spent for a cleaning appliance!!
Content:
Well, ok...it's tied for the top spot with another Bissell product, the original Big Green Clean Machine (which, sadly, is no longer available). 
Aside from the less than stellar assembly instructions, this vacuum was a winner from the get-go.  I have three long-haired cats so I desperately need a machine that can pull up the hair and doesn't require a loan to purchase. Needless to say, this vacuum blew me away.  After doing just my kitchen and living room, the cup needed emptying--literally full of hair! And that is just the beginning.  The suction is so strong it pulled up debris that was below the backing of the carpet--you know, that fine dust you see under older padding (looked like the consistency of talcum powder).  The upholstery attachment with the rotating brush is wonderful at pulling the hair from any fabric; it works so well I haven't had to try the one specifically for removal of pet hair!  The extra-long cord and the ease in which it moves are merely icing on the cake.  The filtering system keeps the air clean from dust, which is a must for those with allergies.  The worth of this product exceeds its price!

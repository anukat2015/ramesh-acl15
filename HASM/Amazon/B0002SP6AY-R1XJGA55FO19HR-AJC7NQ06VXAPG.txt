Title: Glad I purchased it.
Content:
I have no dislikes about this unit.  I purchased it a few months ago.  I was easy to install.  It is easy to program and set.  The light stays on long enough for my needs(this was a negative I read before I purchased it). I have been very satisfied with the performance, the easy of instalation and the product on the whole.  I recommend this unit.

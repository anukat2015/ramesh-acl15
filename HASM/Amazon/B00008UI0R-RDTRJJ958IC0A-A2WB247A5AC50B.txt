Title: Good quality, but too heavy for a canister
Content:
This is a good quality product. The suction is strong and the brush works well. However, there are two drawbacks that need to be known:
1. It is pretty heavy for a canister. If you buy this product for easy manuvering, forget it. The wand and the brush head are too heavy for easy handling. Althout it is still better than a upright for underbed use, it is mainly due to its canister design, not its handling.
2. The canister is pretty cumbersom as well and it cannot stand up as some other models so it can be difficult for vacuuming stairs - unless your stair steps are BIG!
3. Not all tools are stored in the canister. The power upholstery tool and the floor tool are extras. Only two small tools are stored in the canister.
Overall, I would say that the construction is in good quality, but the handling sucks. All the controls are right on the handle, which is a big plus and makes the combersome design a little more bearable.

Title: Bad deal
Content:
In this package, you need only the camera, the lens, and the memory card (32gb memory card is too much, just go for 4 or 8 gb, rest are junk).  You should be able to buy everything I mentioned for less than $3600.00.  Here is my suggestion, if you are new to photography, go for Canon 5d Mark II Kit, which comes with Canon 24-105 L series lens, which is very nice.  And, get a 4 or 8 gb memory card separately. Don't get fooled by this package deal.

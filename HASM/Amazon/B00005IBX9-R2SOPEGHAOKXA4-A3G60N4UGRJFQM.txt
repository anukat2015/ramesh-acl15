Title: Good coffee maker with nice features..
Content:
I can not identify with any real drawbacks others have commented on, with the exception of the process of adding water.
It's very clumsy doing it with the carafe, so I plan to use another container that I can maneuver easily. Access to the water reservoir should have been at the front of the machine for ease in filling.
Shame on the designers for not noticing this.
As far as making coffee, it's not very fast, but I certainly find my coffee piping hot. 
If you go on some 'coffee expert forums' you might be surprised to find this particular one is rated fairly high for a conventional drip machine.
I've had no problem with the taste. I hold my one cup (13oz) Starbucks Barista Solo as a standard, and I can say this one meets my expectations as to flavor.
I like the design, with the aforementioned exception, and hope it lasts a long time. I did purchase a factory refurb model (which by the way was absolutely brand new in every way). Time will tell, but for now it is a great addition to the kitchen, and the 'Solo' gets allocated to our game/exercise room.

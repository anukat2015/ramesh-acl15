Title: Not same quality as 4th gen iPods, but still the winning design
Content:
Pros: It has the perfect design - both hardware and software. Its minuscule size and excellent music management software iTunes makes up for the missing Bluetooth & WiFi. Great sound and battery life too.
Cons: Not same hardware quality as older Apple products - I bought two 2nd gen nanos last week - the 2GB and 8GB. I've owned a few Apple products for years now and I noticed that the quality of the new nano is not as robust as the previous iPods or other Apple devices. The hold button on 2GB nano is loose. The 8GB black had a flimsy wheel that won't stay put. A click felt like 2 clicks, and soon started to make funny sounds as if its going to fall apart. I eventually had to return and get a replacement twice ! I had a similar experience with another Apple product (not iPod) a month ago, the 1st piece was defective so had to replace the next day.
Conclusion: I still give nano 4 stars since in the big schema of things, its a superb MP3 device, specially because its music management software iTunes works much better than others (which by the way is one of the big reasons for iPod's success). It is VERY easy to transfer music to your iPod and that is a big time saver, especially if you plan to change your playlists or download new podcasts everyday.
Bottom Line: I highly recommend iPod nanos. I just wish that for a $250 device Apple paid tad more attention to the hardware quality. Make sure you test your piece well as soon as you get it. You would love listening to your music on it.

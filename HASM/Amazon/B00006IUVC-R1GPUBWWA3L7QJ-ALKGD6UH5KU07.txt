Title: Buyer Beware - DANGEROUS and SERIOUS defects!
Content:
I have a Versabrew plus 1250 coffee maker, purchased from Wallmart.  This unit is about a month old now.  This unit has serious and DANGEROUS problems:
First, however, the segmented LED clock display didn't function correctly right out of the box.  Random LED segments fail to illuminate for days at a time, then seem to work for no apparant reason.  For example, it might display  :00  instead of 1:00
Recently, when brewing coffee, HOT water now squirts out from the flavor select slot above where the coffe grounds are held.  About 25% of the total brewing water PROJECTS from the coffee maker!  This has burned me several times - needless to say I no longer use this coffee maker.
Wallmart will not take this machine back without a receipt, and my requests to Black and Decker have gone unanswered.  No wonder Consumer Reports rates B&D so low in the world of coffee makers.

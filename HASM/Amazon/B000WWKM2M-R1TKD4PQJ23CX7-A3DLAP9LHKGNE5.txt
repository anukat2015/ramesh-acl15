Title: My First Notebook - Stellar!
Content:
I received this computer three days ago. Although I will admit to being smitten with the novelty of simply having a laptop, this is amazing. The tablet feature alone blew me away. This notebook is able to convert into a "slate" and a touch-screen with an attachment allow you to write in any box (even on the internet) where input is needed.
It even recognizes cursive handwriting! I just wrote this in MY OWN WRITING!!!
Naysayers be damned, I give Windows Vista my full confidence. Period.
(I'm still using the pen to write.) Vista's usability & user-friendliness is simply astounding! This is the first computer I have ever owned that allowed me to be online within 10 minutes of startup. A gem, through & through!!

Title: Does a great job but a bit noisey
Content:
UPDATE: Seems like the noise I previously reported has soften somewhat during these days. Maybe there is a break in period for the cyclonic fan... I don't know, but at least I can now fall asleep. It's still noisy in comparison to other heaters but I am very happy nonetheless. The remote is key btw. I use it every night to turn it on and/or set the timer. I can even use it in the dark since the function buttons are surrounding the one large power button. You remember where the timer button or temperature button is located and you definitely know which is the power button.
The bottom line is that this heater looks great against the wall, taking very little space in depth and with it's manual 90 degree rotation for output flow, it easily heats up my 15x15 drafty renovated room, when compared to smaller 1500watt heaters. The remote is very convenient to use while waking up in the morning BUT this is NOT the quietest heater I ever had. Since Auto Temp control only works in high setting, if you want to go to sleep with the heater ON while using the Timer, the noise from the fan will keep you awake. The rotation noise is flawed and is even louder than my air purifier. I will be exchanging this model at Sears to see if this was just an isolated incident and will update this review with the details in the future.
Overall, a great heater that looks great against the wall and does a very good job at heating a room, despite the noise.

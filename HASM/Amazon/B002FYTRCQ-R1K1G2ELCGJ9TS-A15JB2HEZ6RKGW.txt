Title: Wish I could give ZERO STARS
Content:
This vac was impressive out of the box. the suction was amazing... for a week. You quickly will discover that his vac takes an enormous amount of TLC. If you have a woman in the house with longish hair, or pets, it will clog up immediately.  You have to use your fingers or a tool to pull out the debris EVERY time you vacuum. The filter pad has direct contact with debris, so it need to be replaced or washed every few vacuums.  WE VACUUM EVERY DAY.. not carpet.. hard wood floors.. and this vac lasted a month before it completely died, despite all our extra care of unclogging, etc.
I'm not sure what it is supposed to vacuum up. It can't handle hair.. it chokes on anything bigger than a cheerio.
Miserable, awful product.  Went into the garbage today.
I suspect it has probably already been discontinued.
PLEASE don't waste your money.

Title: Braun coffeemaker experience
Content:
I bought the Braun 10 cup white coffeemaker about one year ago.  My coffeepot  appears to have the same features as this one except for the TimeControl.  I can not find out if my model is still available.  Initially I read positive reviews and was quite pleased with it.  I had owned a Braun coffee pot previously for 18 years with no problems until the heating element went out.  This new coffeemaker, however, has developed a series of problems so severe that I am going to throw it out.  Initially the coffee started tasting bitter, especially if not poured as soon as it was made.  Then the "pause and pour" feature quit, and I noticed the coffeepot started dripping whenever I poured from it.  The most recent change is that the filter basket swings out while the coffee is brewing, every time!!  I won't buy Braun again.

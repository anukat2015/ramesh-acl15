Title: I love this camera
Content:
I own both the D40 and D80; it's a overkill having two for what I do as an amateur/leisure photographer, but this is a great camera that does all I need.  The differentiator between D40 and D80 for what I do are the following: AF lens support (D80), faster function/info access (D80), finer controls (D80), and portability (D40).  I don't see the D40 as an inferior camera; in fact, it's much easier to shoot to get good pictures.   Using the kit lens 18-55mm 3.5-56G Nikkor, I can lug the D40 all day and not break a sweat.
With the D80, I find myself playing with the control much more trying to get a different shot, and this is my portrait camera as well as my photography teacher.  I use a 80-200mm f/2.8 Nikkor ED lens typically, and it doesn't focus as fast as my 18-200mm VR lens.  The VR lens makes it almost too easy to get sharp pictures, but the fast aperture AF lens is more satisfying to shoot because it's more challenging.
In conclusion the D80 is a versatile and capable camera for an aspiring photographer that wants to learn the technicals, while the D40 is a great SLR camera for anyone that wants to take good pictures.

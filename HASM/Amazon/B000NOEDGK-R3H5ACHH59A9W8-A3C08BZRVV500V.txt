Title: Nikon D40x - problems
Content:
I bought this camera 7 months ago to replace a Pentax SLR film camera.
I am not pleased with my purchase.
The autofocus is frequently ineffective, and I have had hundreds of shots ruined by uneven focusing. I now do not use autofocus, but manual, and I always shoot two shots of the same scene to ensure that at least one of them is in focus. 
The 6-point focus of other cameras appears to work better.

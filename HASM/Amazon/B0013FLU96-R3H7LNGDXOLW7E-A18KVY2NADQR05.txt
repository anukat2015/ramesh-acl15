Title: service excellent
Content:
Amazon promptly shipped a brand new apple macbook Pro for my college senior within one week of the order date.  The laptop worked beautifully.
After returning to college, within two weeks it completely was unresponsive.  However, we took it to the local apple store, received a replacement and she is happy and back to school with a working laptop.  The best thing about ordering through amazon is that you are guarunteed a quality product, and the manufacturers stand behind those products 100%
Thank you for excellent customer service!!!!

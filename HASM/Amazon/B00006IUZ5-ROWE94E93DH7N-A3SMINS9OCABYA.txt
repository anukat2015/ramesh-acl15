Title: As a replacement
Content:
I bought this for my Mother to replace an older model which had built up calcium deposits and leaked badly. It works fine, just as well as the older model. But my Mother is nearly blind and pretty feeble. The new location for the "On" switch is a little harder for her to find and it is pretty stiff. She has a difficult time depressing the button to turn it on. The ridges help her locate it, but the location of the appliance on her counter requires her to reach an arm's length so when she depresses the button her finger rests on the ridge around the button and makes it difficult to depress it far enough to turn it on. The older split lip switch was much easier to work for her.

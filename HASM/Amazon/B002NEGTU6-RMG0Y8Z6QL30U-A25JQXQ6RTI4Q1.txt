Title: Totally Awesome
Content:
Love everything about it.  The sheer volume of functions and capabilities is a little overwhelming at first but after spending some time with the camera and a good book about it, you'll be taking great pictures in no time.  It makes great movies too!  Just beware that the internal mic will record the sounds of the focus and zoom so you'll want to invest in an external mic.  Also, the autofocus really doesn't work in movie mode but I haven't found using the manual focus in movie mode to be an issue.  Buy it, you'll love it.

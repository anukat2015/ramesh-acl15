Title: Great for the first 6 months then it quits
Content:
I am extremely disatisfied with my Keurig.  I loved the company one and loved this one until after 6 months I had problems.  I called and was told to descale it and if that didnt help it would be replaced.  I did everything and when I called back the tech was rude, acted as if I were an idiot and that it was my fault.  
I received this as a gift for Christmas 07 so I do not  have a receipt of purchase and because the serial number says it was manufactured in dec 06 - feb 07 theres nothing that can be done.  When I explained it was a Christmas gift the tech flat out told me I was lieing and it showed purchased dec06-feb07 the next tech explained thats when it was manufactured.
I now less than a year after receiving this have a semi working $150 coffee machine taking up spac on my counter.  I am severely dissapointed and will make sure I reccomend NOT to buy an Keurig product its not worth the price when it quits after a few months and nothing will be done about it.

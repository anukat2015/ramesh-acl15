Title: great on carpets, average on wood floors
Content:
The best thing about this vac is the easy-empty of the bin. Unlike with most vacs, the dust and cat hair comes out when you dump and you don't have to stick your hand up in it to dislodge the stuck debris.
In the year I have owned the twin-clean, the signal light to clean the filters has never come on and they appear to still be pretty clean (so unlike my old vac that was completely caked with cat hair after every vacuum.)
The suction is fantastic on carpets and my short-nap area rug looks new after use. On carpet mode it tends to charge ahead and you have to hold it back.
However, it is a little weak on the wood floors. I think this is because the attachment is way too wide so the suction is dissapated and therefore weaker. I find myself "sweeping" the cat litter into a little central pile so it will suck it up. The wide size also makes it a little tough to get into tight places. Lastly, it has an odd-shaped nozzle so you can't buy a smaller generic attachment.
When vacuuming the floors it is extremely quiet and really loud on carpets. 
Design-wise it looks cool, but is a little bulky and awkward to manage. 
A few tweaks and this could be the best vacuum on earth. Buy it only if you have more carpet than hard floors.

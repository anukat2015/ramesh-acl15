Title: Loved it while it lasted...
Content:
I'm crazy about coffee.   I had this coffee maker for almost two years and loved it...
Unfortunately,   It began to shut off while brewing, and sometimes not turn on at all.  
While it lasted, it was one of my best coffee makers.  
When I called Cuisinart, they immediately offered to replace it with the same model, but they were on back order and I would have had to wait about 4 - 5 weeks for delivery.  They gave me the option of choosing a different model (which I did).   
 I rate their customer service 5 stars and I will continue to enjoy another Cuisinart coffee maker.

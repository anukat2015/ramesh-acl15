Title: Awesome Idea ... but
Content:
I have been a rhapsody to-go customer for a while and I love the service. I was really looking forward to the prospect of being able to have access to the full rhapsody catalogue anywhere I could pick up a wi-fi signal on this little device.
However, after giving it a couple of weeks, I just didn't think that it was worth the extra money to have the wi-fi feature when accessing signals is usually case sensitive to needing a password. Furthermore, because there is no keyboard to type in your searches, or mouse to drag and drop selections (like there is when you sync a regular mp3 to rhapsody via a computer), I found myself quickly getting tired of trying to add content to my player wirelessly just because it wasn't very time efficient. Though the download time was quick, scrolling through the alphabet one letter at a time to enter in your song or artist was not.
Once the lure of the main feature wore off so fast, the comparitively larger size and shorter battery life to my last mp3 player made me yearn for a newer version of my old mp3 player ... which I got when I returned my Ibizia. I now have a Sansa Fuze and couldn't be happier with it.

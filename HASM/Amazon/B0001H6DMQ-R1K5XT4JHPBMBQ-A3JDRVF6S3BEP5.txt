Title: Hoover S3755 Bagless WindTunnel Canister
Content:
The cord retractor stopped working the second time I used it.  The filter has to be cleaned after every use and takes 5 minutes or more to get all the dirt off.  I much prefer a "bagged" canister.  On the positive side, the suction is good and the attachments are easy to change.

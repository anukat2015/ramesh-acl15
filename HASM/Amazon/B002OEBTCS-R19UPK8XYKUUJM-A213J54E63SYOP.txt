Title: Good but with bugs
Content:
I did a lot of research before buying the Pentax k-m (bought 2/5/10, with 2 extra lens) and found that this camera was highly recommended across the internet. Now that I've bought the camera and a lot of accessories for the camera (i.e. ext. flash, remote and etc.), I am now wondering if it was the right decision or not, because now I find several web sites are reporting a "mirror slap" problem (i.e. blurred images) with some Pentax k-m's. Some people report that they have exchanged the camera for a new one only to find that the new one has the same problem and some report that the camera appears to be fine, but the problem only shows up here and there (i.e. not a consistent problem, so it appears that buying this camera is a crap shoot). My camera appears to be fine at the moment, but I am wondering when the problem will show up and will Pentax be able to fix the problem without a lot of hassle (BTW Pentax has not admitted that there is a problem). I usually wait a year or two before buying big ticket items, so that the bugs are all worked out, but today it seems like the new models are replacing the old model on everything so fast that there is no time to work the bugs, so everything is becoming a crap shoot. I vote for working old models rather than hit and miss new models with new features that I could live without (or probably will never use) as long as the item worked as it should!!!!!

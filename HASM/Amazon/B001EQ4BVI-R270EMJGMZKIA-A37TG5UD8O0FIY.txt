Title: Not a camera review.
Content:
It's quite shocking that a major company like amazon.com would so shabbily pack such an expensive and delicate item. Beyond the bubble wrap which was packed by Canon, Amazon.com did very little to prepare the package for long distance shipping. All there was was a very weak cardboard box cushioned by plastic airbags which was in near shreds by the time it got to me. No packing peanuts, bubble wrap or even proper taping was done. My idea of amazon.com being a responsible and concerned shipper has gone down the drains. Shame on you, Amazon.
Edit: Yes I understand that Beach Camera had shipped this, but when you're buying under Amazon.com trademarks, you'll not settle for a gamble.

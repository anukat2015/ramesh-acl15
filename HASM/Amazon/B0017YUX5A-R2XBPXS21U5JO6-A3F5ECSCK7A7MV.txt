Title: Happy in Albuquerque
Content:
Our old Hoover Demension 1000 vacuum (probably 22 years old) bit the dust, excuse the pun.  We were looking to mirror that vacuum as closely as possible in a replacement.  We looked in Sears at a couple of Hoovers and a Kenmore, but we were not convinced they were anywhere close in quality.  They both cost more than what the Hoover Anniversary vac cost.  We decided to browse the Internet, and we came upon the Hoover Anniversary...truly a jewel find.  It is much quieter than the Demension 1000, but it seems to have just as much suction power.  A couple of features we would add are an additional small brush that has very soft bristles that can be used over furniture as a duster (the one included is rather stiff) and a switch to cut off the vacuum at the handle (as others have suggested). We are very happy with our purchase, and it arrived well before we expected.  Count us in the 5 star rating!!!

Title: Top Notch and Worth Every Dime
Content:
Its funny how we as consumers don't hesitate to buy something inexpensive, like overpriced Starbucks coffee every day (which really adds up), but when it comes to a $2000 investment, like this laptop, we hesitate.  Well, don't. I can tell you this computer is worth it.  I was hesitant at first to make the purchase, wondering if I really needed it, but it is an investment that is and will continue to pay off, not just for college, but for life in general.  Computers, and especially laptops, are becoming cache's of personal life. What better way to trust our computing experience and organize our digital life, than to a good computer. You pay for what you get, and Mac's are the best.
So if you want a laptop that is powerful (it's my all in one solution), simple to use, great battery life (a good solid 4 hours), reliable and secure, brilliant hi resolution screen, this is what you should go for. 
 FYI, I'm a college student who used to be a Windows power user, and now that I use Mac, I don't have to worry about spyware and virus's anymore.  Such a relief.  There is no other laptop I'd go with.

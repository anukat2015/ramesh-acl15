Title: Cuisinart DCC-1200  Review
Content:
Excellent coffee maker.  If you are going to buy a coffee maker this is the one.  With just two in our household, the 2-4 cup option is a plus.  I also enjoy using the timer to wake up to the aroma of fresh coffee in the morning.  Warming plate keeps the coffee Hot if not ready to drink right away.  Easy to use and very stylish.

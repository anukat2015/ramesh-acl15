Title: What a Heck of a Sucker!
Content:
This vacuum is pretty good. It has sucked up things that were in my carpet that I never knew existed! It was easy to put together and came in a timely manner.  However, when it comes to trying to reach under a piece of furniture it is rather bulky and the handle of the vacuum doesn't drop close to the ground without the front of the vacuum coming off the ground.
All in all, I do like this vacuum because of the job it does on dog hair and the fun attachments.

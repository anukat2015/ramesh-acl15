Title: The brand is over valued
Content:
I think Sony is loosing it charm. This machine was not what expected. It start giving problems 6 months after the purchase. The battery life is a quarter of what it was after 1 year usage. With the rice paid for this, I would expect MacBook quality at least. Even with this Sony relatively high end machine, I would not suggest anyone to spend more than $1K for any Windows based notebook including Sony brand. In good side, having HDMI output is great if you like to connect this to your LCD, using a single cable for both Video and sound.

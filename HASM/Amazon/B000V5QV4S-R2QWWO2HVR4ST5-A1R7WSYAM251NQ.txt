Title: From the hands of a first-time DSLR user
Content:
I made the jump from a Canon S2 IS (with which I was very happy using) to the 40D recently.  I consider myself an amateur but with a decent amount of disposable income, and having outgrown the S2, the 40D was the next logical step in terms of moving to a DSLR, having cross-shopped it's predecessor the 30D and the Rebel XTi.  
The 40D's advantages over the XTi and 30D were considerable enough that I could justify the increase in price, and not feel like I had "settled" for something that I would later on regret.  Yes, the technology of camera bodies progresses so quickly that the 40D might easily become obsolete by this time next year, but at the same time there's enough in this camera that I think, for someone like me, it will be very hard to outgrow it.  
I will be using this camera mainly for photographing outdoor action, specifically automotive racing and events.  For me, the 6.5fps will be extremely important.  The live view is not a big plus for me, I don't foresee myself using that feature much.  
The amount of features can make the camera a little intimidating for a beginner.  If I was on a tighter budget, its very likely that I could have been content with the XTi, or Nikon's D80.  One thing that I am still having trouble getting used to is the inability to use the LCD as the viewfinder (except in live view mode, it's not really the same thing).  Also, at 10 megapixels, even the S-normal sized pictures come out huge.  It's not like the S2 IS, where I could upload casual shots onto the computer and not have to resize, simply save and upload and publish.  But then again, this camera isn't for the casual photographer taking casual photos (at least, not JUST for that purpose).

Title: Very very satisfied -  you get your money's worth
Content:
Excellent suction on carpet, has 3 suction levels depending on type of carpet. Very convenient switch on handle to toggle between carpet mode or floor mode, ie. tile, wood, etc.  The only drawback is that on hardwood floors, in order to really get the dust vacuumed you have to attached the floor brush, which basically looks like a long horizontal hairbrush.  Otherwise you can just use the standard carpet/floor hookup and it will do a little-above a descent job on your hardwood floor.
I'm very happy with it.  The price was perfect for what I got.  All the other hookups work great.  Canister is easy to empty, power cord is very long which is very convenient.

Title: Rattling mess
Content:
Heater does the job while occupying little space. After heavy use one weekend the unit retained a permanent rattle when in operation. Like a fan blade or something out of balance. Unit never shut off or reached some sort of thermal peak so unsure why it developed the annoying sound. I still use it, but that noise gets to me everytime.

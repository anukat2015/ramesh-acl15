Title: Great camera for the price
Content:
This was my first SLR purchase.  It's a big step up from the standard point-and-shoot cameras, which were starting to seem underpowered and short on features to me.  I knew going in that the SLRs had a bit of a learning curve, and that was certainly the case here.  But...if you want complete control over how you take pictures, you're going to need to put in the time to learn how to use the equipment.
I bought the Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens at the same time as the camera, and have been very satisfied.  It takes great pictures, and most of the functions are easy to see and use.  There are two buttons on the front of the camera that I keep forgetting about during use, but I'm sure that will change as I get more comfortable with it.
The only problem I've had so far is taking indoor sports pictures; they either come out blurry or dark.  It's not unexpected (action shots require a faster shutter speed and don't let as much light in; but letting in more light requires a slower shutter speed, making moving objects look blurry.)  I'm sure more experience (or additional lenses/flashes...?) will sort this out.
I also decided to get an additional battery (Canon LP-E5) because it takes about 3 hours to fully charge a battery; and the fastest SDHC card I could find (SanDisk 4GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card SDSDX3-004G-P31) so that I wouldn't be waiting for the camera to finish saving the last picture before being able to take the next one.
Overall, it's a solid camera with great features and performance.

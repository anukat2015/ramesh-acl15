Title: OUTSTANDING
Content:
I was kinda worried about purchasing this with all the negative reviews that folks have written.  My Father has one of these but with the burner not the carafe.  
To date we love this machine, no problems with leaks like most people have complained about and the coffee is almost to hot to drink first thing when it is done brewing in the 2 minutes in the morning.  
I would not hesitate to purchase this for a gift for someone or to buy for our other reasons ie.  boat, camper, motor home, other home.
I hope that my review is helpful to you.

Title: Ya sure entry level DSLR
Content:
Ok here is my background before the review:
--I love photography, but I don't know that much about it.
--I'm serious about learning, I want to invest enough study into photography for it to be a possible fall back job.
--I'm a freaking poor kid in college
In my opinion, the D40 was a good choice for an entry level DSLR. I've never experienced anything higher like the D70/D80 or any of Canon's product line but I'm truly impressed with what the D40 had. Besides all the specs and whatnot I think the LCD screen in status mode (with aperture/shutter etc etc) was invaluable to be able to visually comprehend what the camera was really doing when I go for a bigger aperture or whatever. Maybe I'm just a logical person in that way but it works for me.
I'm sure there are many options and features I haven't really experienced on the higher models, but right now I'm content with mastering the features the D40 has. I'll probably get a 55-200mm VR lens sometime soon but nothing like an upgraded camera until I feel completely restricted by the lack of the D40's features as well as my wallet is burning a hole in my pants.

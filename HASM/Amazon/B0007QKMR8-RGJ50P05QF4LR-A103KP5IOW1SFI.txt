Title: Wonderful Starter DSLR
Content:
Received the Rebel XT as a bday present and here are my impressions after a couple of weeks.  Note: I had a 35mm Rebel SLR, so I did not need to purchase lenses.
Pros:  Granted my previous digital is a 2.1 MP point and shoot, but the Rebel is insanely fast.  Near instantanous start up, and can shoot 3 shots/second.  I purchased a 1 GB Sandisk high speed CF card to make sure the speed kept up.  
Canon's website has an extensive tuitoral about the Rebel, and from it I have found that Aperture priority (AV) mode works best in most situations.  I am really a beginner with advanced modes, but have easily found setting that make the photos come out well.
Other settings I have been playing with include the B/W and filter modes.
The auto-focus works great in all situations I've tried.
I haven't needed to recharge the battery in 2 weeks.
Cons:
Camera is slighly compact, which is slightly uncomfortable in large hands.
I have Paint Shop Pro already, so the included software (Photobrowser, ArcSoft Photo Editor and Canon Photo Professional) are mostly useless to me, with the exception of Canon Photo being the only software I have to process RAW images.
The camera is still a work in progress, as I still have a lot of paces to put it through.

Title: Awesome Gadget!!!!!!!!
Content:
I am here to write a review now that I have bought and recieved the ipod nano from apple.com. This is an amazing device. I was the person who wrote the review about how the two guys put their ipod nano through its paces by throwing it out of a moving car for example. If you get it from apple, you can get the back of your ipod engraved for free. I have already put many albums of music on mine, and the sound quality is amazing for such a little gadget. The screen is very clear and crisp and the click wheel is amazingly easy to use. I did end up getting the 4GB instead of the 2GB, I wanted to make sure I could fit all of my music onto it. I would also recommend getting a case for the ipod nano. I've fallen in love with mine and I would like it to last a very long time. So, all in all, I definitely recommend the 4GB white ipod nano. You will not be dissappointed!!!!

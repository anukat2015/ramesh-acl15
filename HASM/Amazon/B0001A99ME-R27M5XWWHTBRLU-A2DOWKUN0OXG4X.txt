Title: Cool but definately not worth the price
Content:
My father has one.  It is cool.  But seriously,  who  would pay 249 dollars
for a pastel colored ipod that doesnt even carry as many songs as a 1G.
People fell for that  atrocious price.  Get a 20 GB Click wheel.  It gives you 16 GB of more songs for just 50 more dollars.

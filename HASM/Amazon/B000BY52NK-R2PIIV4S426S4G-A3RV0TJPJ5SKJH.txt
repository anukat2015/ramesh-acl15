Title: So complicated a camera, that it deserves its own blog
Content:
Just a few days play with my brother-in-law's camera tells me everything I needed to know about this camera - that it produces images with better colour and tone than what I can get with my own D70. The ability to select the exact colour temperature, in addition to preset and fine-tuning white balance means I managed to get super-accurate colours. High Contrast setting on the D200 gives me exactly what I want, not like the artifical-looking skin tones from the D70 with the same setting. More Vivid means you really can get that Velvia-pop with landscapes, macros and nature photography.

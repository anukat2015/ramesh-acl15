Title: Dead on arrival
Content:
Vacuum arrived unable to power-on. Called Electrolux customer service and although they were very nice, they came to the conclusion that I got a dud. Clearly Electrolux has some quality control problems. Very disappointing because at the current price, this vacuum seems like a great bargain. Oh well.

Title: Buyer Beware !
Content:
Well purchased a Toshiba Satellite for my son for Christmas and have disappointed since day one. Plugged it up and we get scrambled LCD screen with black blobs all over the place. I call Toshiba for advice and the first thing they say is this is covered under warranty. Seems they will not repair any screen related issues with there laptops. They said it was caused by abuse. I find this hard to believe since it was this way right out of the box and used for less than 3 days. No were in the warranty book does it say this is not covered. I ask for them to point this out to me and no one would answer my question. The kicker is they want $425 to repair a $400 computer. I will be returning this laptop and will avoid Toshiba like the black plague. I would suggest anyone considering a Toshiba call the warranty department first and ask them what does there warranty cover. Don't make the mistake I made.

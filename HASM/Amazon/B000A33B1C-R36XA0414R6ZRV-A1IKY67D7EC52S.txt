Title: Great heater
Content:
As I did research for this...I took into consideration the reviews on Amazon to help make my decision. My new Delonghi does make noise in warming up and cooling down...but it's in my baby's room, so he is fine with it. It is pretty warm/hot to touch on my opinion, but again....just keep the baby from touching it. I love it knowing my baby is warm at night. It's toasty, but not dry. The room is about 200 sq. ft and the heater works wonderfully to warm it. My electric bill did go up some....though I'd heard it shouldn't, but to me it's worth the warmth in my son's room. It wasn't a lot of expense in my electric comparatively, since we run it all night, every night, occasionally on a cold day at nap times. I like it.

Title: Not Exactly Mine but....
Content:
I got this laptop directly from the HP website, the only difference is that mine was 300 dollars cheaper due to their promotions, and my laptop has nvidia 320M and 8gm ram instead of nvidia 230m and the 4gb ram. Also, I ordered the 12 cell battery instead of the standard 6 cell one. Mine has a N card, while this laptop has a wireless G card This laptop is amazing, nothing more, nothing less. Here are the pros and cons set up easy:
Pros
-Extremely quick and capable of multitasking
-Amazing graphics (230M is even better than 320m, meaning this product has even better graphics than mine does).
-Great for gaming due to good memory
-great for work and movies.
-Easy to learn how to use with windows 7.
-Great keyboard.
-HP! Despite opinions, HPs give better bang for buck in my experiences
-Light
-Clear screen
-Good webcam
-full numberpad
Cons
-being a powerful laptop, it does get hot
-you need to know how to set the settings for the battery to squeeze out the length that's claimed. 6 cells will last only around 1-2 hours of light to medium usage, while 12 cells last only 2-3 hours.
-FINGERPRINT MAGNET. This is what i hate about this laptop, my old HP didn't attract fingerprints like this one does. Even the touch pad leaves loads of fingerprints. 
-Could have more upgrades. Then again with more upgrades comes more costs.
This laptop is a powerful machine, and quite frankly, it WILL last you the 3-4 years you would want it to. Granted you could squeeze out a lot more time out of it, but it will be top of the line until those 3-4 years end. PERFECT for college, since it can do gaming, media, internet, work, all at the same time! The hard drive is also a pretty decent size, making it a factory of usefulness! I'm very satisfied with this laptop, and I'm sure any other students or professionals will be as well.

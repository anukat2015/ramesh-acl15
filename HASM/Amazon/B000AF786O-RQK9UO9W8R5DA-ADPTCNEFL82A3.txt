Title: Lid leaks... buy the cone, ditch the mug
Content:
My husband purchased the Melitta for me after reading the reviews about the quality of the coffee and the problems with the lid.  I experienced both issues.  
First, this makes a consistently great cup of coffee exactly the way Alton Brown explains it (see the Good Eats episode "True Brew").  I love the flavor the cone produces, and it is easy to clean - drop the paper filter in the trash and rinse the cone.  
Second, after about 2 weeks of use, the top started to drip.  My husband warned me that this might happen, and it did.  So, I now either leave the lid off or use the coffee mug from QuikTrip when I want it on the go.  
Do you mind paying $9 for a coffee cone that produces a great cup of coffee and a throw-away mug?  If so, the Melitta is for you.  If not, try another alternative.  Hope this was helpful.

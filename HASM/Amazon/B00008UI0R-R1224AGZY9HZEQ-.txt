Title: Fab Light canister vacuum
Content:
We just got this today and it took a couple of minutes to put it together and it is SUPER FAST. It works so well and is so light. Even our 7 year old daughter tried it out and liked it :) It changed from the carpet setting to hardwood floor with ease. It also has a suction control button. The attachment for our stairs (we have a three storey house) is fantastic. It has the option to have the brush rotate or not just like the usual floor attachment. Very easy to change attachments. Very happy with this purchase so far. It is day 1, though....

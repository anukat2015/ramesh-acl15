Title: Anti-Apple for years
Content:
I was anti-apple for years.  This was mostly due to being comfortable and knowing the in's and out's of windows.  I wanted to broaden my horizons (so to speak) by learning a new operating system.  If I was going to switch to Apple, I wanted their top of the line notebook.  This has not disappointed.  I'm running Windows 7 via Fusion 2.0, and it runs seamlessly within OS X.  The trackpad (along with the incredible battery on the 17" model) is one of its biggest selling points.  I dont think I could go back to a regular 'point and click' trackpad.  The multiple swipes and pinches are highly intuitive and I have adjusted to them easily.  The monitor is also elegant.  Colors are vibrant and black levels are the deepest I've seen in a portable.  
Highly recommended.

Title: Aesthetics good, performance poor
Content:
The vaccuum looks great, and it has decent suction.  That's the positives.
However, I find it difficult to hold, at the shape is more designed for looks than ergonomics.  The design also vents the outgoing air from a band around the middle, which tends to blow dust and crumbs and such all over as you're trying to clean.  The tiny nozzle helps to increase the suction but reduces the aea convered, meaning you spend a lot more time making tiny passes over the area compared to wider intakes on traditional "dust buster" units.

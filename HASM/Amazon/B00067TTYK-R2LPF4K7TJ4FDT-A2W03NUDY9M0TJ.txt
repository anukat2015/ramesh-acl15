Title: Wow!
Content:
Creative has hit a home run with this player! I received my Micro(White) yesterday and I couldn't be happier. This tiny little wonder is great. It is my first mp3 player and I had it up and running in minutes. The vertical scroll bar hasn't been a problem for me at all. Creating playlists is a snap and adds to the versatility of the player. I used Windows Media Player 10 to transfer my music. It worked without any glitches. I highly recommend the Creative Zen Micro to anyone who wants a fantastic player that works as good as it looks. 
By the way, Amazon had this to me in three days with free shipping! They totally back up what they sell, so go ahead 
and get off the fence and join the mp3 revolution.

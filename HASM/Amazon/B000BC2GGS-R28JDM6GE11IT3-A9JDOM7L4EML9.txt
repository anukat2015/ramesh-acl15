Title: Honeywell HZ519 COMFORT HEATER
Content:
AS ADVERTISED, THIS IS A FINE ROOM HEATER. IT'S QUIET, AND TAKES ABOUT A HALF HOUR TO WARM OUR SUNROOM (10 X 14) AND KEEPS THE ROOM AT A COMFORTABLE TEMP EVEN WHEN IT'S 32 OUTSIDE. NOT REAL WARM BUT AROUND 64, WITH A SWEATER, VERY COMFORTABLE. NO PROBLEMS AND EASY TO USE, VERY ATTRACTIVE IN THE ROOM (LOW PROFILE). I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS UNIT.

Title: Defenetly good machine.
Content:
Works good. I have it for 3-4 month, I am using mainly on wood floors, and some time on area rugs.Good suction. It is not very noisy. Good selection of attachments. It would be great if wood floor attachment could be locked on wand. It has tendency to fail off.

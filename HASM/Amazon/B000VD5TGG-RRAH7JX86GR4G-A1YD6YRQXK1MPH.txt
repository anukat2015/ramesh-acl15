Title: Reviews don't do this thing justice
Content:
I bought this after a Hoover Steamvac died. I tried a Dirt Devil Easy Steamer and hated it. I work in hospitality and am used to canister style steam cleaners. This is about as close to a commercial unit as you are going to get, just without the huge size and high cost. it does a fantastic job. Not sure what is going on with the bad reviews. I have had this for several months now and use it quite often with animals in the house. It works perfectly every time. It has even gotten out stains that I thought were never coming out! I would definatley recommend this carpet cleaner.

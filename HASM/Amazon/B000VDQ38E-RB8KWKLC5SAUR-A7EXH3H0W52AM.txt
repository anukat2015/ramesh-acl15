Title: The best vacuum cleaner we ever owned
Content:
First, a short insight into our life and the dirt that goes a long with it.  We have two children and a medium-sized, short-haired dog.  We moved into our new home, which was professionally cleaned, 6 months ago.
We just used the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser for the first time & couldn't believe the dirt and pet hair that came off our rugs, floors, stairs & couches.  The vacuum and its attachments are nothing short of amazing.
I have read other reviews about the vacuum's only drawback - its weight.  If you have been using a light-weight Oreck, or something of that nature, it's going to be heavier.  Our previous vacuum was an upright, and the Bissell is lighter than our old one.
It's definitely worth the price, at 3x less than the Dyson Animal.
We highly recommend it.

Title: Excellent foot warmer; unobtrusive
Content:
I purchased this about six weeks ago and couldn't be happier. My feet generally get very cold during the winter months, and my office's hardwood floors make things even worse. The Toasty Toes now lies flat under my desk where it keeps my feet comfortable, and as a result my whole body stays warmer.
When I ordered the Toasty Toes, I was concerned about the "ergonimic" part. There are actually two separate plastic pieces than can optionally be attached to unit to give it a slant. I tried them out and found them to be rather flimsy and unstable, which was fine with me since I wanted it to lie flat in the first place.
I highly recommend this unobtrusive (silent, small) and  low energy heater to anyone with cold feet.

Title: Perfect for work!
Content:
My company always has the worst coffee in the breakroom, so I decided to try out this little coffee maker. It stays on my desk at work, and now everyone wants to use it too! It works great, the mug is a good size for me. I usually only drink one cup a day anyway, but this little thing is pretty quick. The filter is easily cleanable and the machine is so simple to use. I highly reccommend this product!

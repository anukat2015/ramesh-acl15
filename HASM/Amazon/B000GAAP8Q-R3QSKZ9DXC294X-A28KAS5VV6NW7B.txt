Title: IPod Nano is a hit!
Content:
I love my IPod Nano that I purchased.  Their were certain reasons that I ordered this specific IPod, the most important reason being it's size.  I run and work out with weights, so I needed a MP3 player that was small in size, but that could hold a lot of music.  The Itunes program makes it easy to download my favorite songs off my CDs, plus I can purchase songs through the internet.  I really do not care to watch videos, so this model fit the bill.  I reccommend purchasing an aftermarket armband that the IPod can fit in.  My workouts are much more productive now that I have my IPod to listen to.

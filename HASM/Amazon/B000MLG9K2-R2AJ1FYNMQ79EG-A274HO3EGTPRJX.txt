Title: A camera smarter than I am.
Content:
You are reading a non technical review from your average fun photographer. So don't expect a lot of technical stuff. I finally stepped up from a Fuji S9000. I have loved my Fuji cameras ease of use and the colors they produce. I was a little reluctant to spend the kind of money it takes to get into the D80. I am thrilled I did. I finally have a digital camera that when the kids do something I catch it as opposed to the camera taking the shot after they have left the room. Super fast. A few Saturdays ago I was outside in our wooded back yard taking pictures of the changing colors in the trees.
When I went to take a shot the flash popped up. I said this isn't right the sun in filtering though the trees but I took the shot anyway. Wow the camera new what to do. Unbelievable photos. Easy to handle even with the pistol
grip MB D80. I also sprung for the SB600 flash and a great two dvd training program on Ebay. So don't be afraid to spend a couple of grand for the D80 and accesories. You will be glad you did. Happy in Alabama

Title: Hot Hot Hot
Content:
We have the 10-cup from Cuisinart, given to us as a gift and are purchasing the 12-cup soon because we've had such a great experience with our 10-cup. I must preface this review that if anyone is qualified enough to review coffee makers, it's my husband.
He loves coffee. Loves. With a capital L. His source of life is probably dripping out of that coffee maker right now. We're upgrading to a 12-cup because that's the least amount he needs (and he goes through *several* 12-cup batches a day). This is no exaggeration!
Anyway, we've gone through many coffee makers, especially carafes. Many carafes don't have the right pouring spout, so he goes in search of another one that doesn't drip down the side if you don't pour it *just* right. (He's figured out that it has to be a wide lip, not a slim one, just incase anyone cares.) Geez, we've stood in an aisle staring at coffee makers for an hour and a half, comparing this feature with that and this spout with that. It was insane.
Another issue was keeping his coffee hot. If he goes through 2 or 3 pots of 12-cups, well, the coffee needs to last at least a few hours. It needs to stay hot and fresh tasting, not burnt.
Cuisinart's carafe takes the cake. It keeps the coffee hotter than any other carafe we've used (and we even bought a separate one to POUR coffee from a glass carafe in). You can leave it for not just a few hours, but the entire day! The spout pours slowly, but that's so the coffee doesn't cool down (duh). Plus, it doesn't drip down the side.
(We've never had an overflow problem with the 10-cup, and we hope that doesn't happen once we have the 12-cup.)

Title: Don't buy this product
Content:
This vacuum is a piece of junk.  I have had to replace the belt 6 times in the last 3 months since I bought it.  It is awkward and clumsy.  We have hard wood floors throughout our house and just area rugs and it takes longer with this piece of junk to vacuum than it did when we had wall to wall carpet.  We have 2 goldens that shed....don't buy this vacuum and hope that it works more than a month.

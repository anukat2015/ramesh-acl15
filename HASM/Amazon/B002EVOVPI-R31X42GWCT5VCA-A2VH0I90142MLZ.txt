Title: Great Coffee
Content:
I wanted to alert everyone that the cone filters that show up as an accessory in amazon aren't the right ones.  This uses number 4 flat-bottom filters.  We use paper filters because of the cholesterol issues.  Now to the review...
Mine works perfectly and makes great coffee.  I don't have much to add to the other reviews, except to compare it specifically to the old swing-arm Capresso model.  I just upgraded because the LCD went out on my old one.
- The grinder is about as quiet as I can imagine.  It's such a low pitch compared to the old one, and compared to my stand-alone Cuisinart grinder, that if the noise still bothers you in the morning, you'll just have to do without fresh ground coffee.
- The carafe doesn't drip everywhere like the old one.
- Coffee comes out hotter, perfectly hot in fact.  The older one wasn't quite up to temperature perfection like this one is.
- Coffee tastes a little richer and better than the old one.  Maybe due to hotter water and/or flat-bottom filter?
An all-around improvement.  We're completely satisfied.

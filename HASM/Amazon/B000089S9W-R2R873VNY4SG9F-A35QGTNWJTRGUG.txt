Title: Problems Fixed???
Content:
Gotta say that I think B & D have done some re-engineering on this item since these initial reviews were written, based on all the problems which I haven't experienced in the week since I've purchased this. The brew-interrupt works fine, the heating element doesn't keep working after the water has gone through, and the spout on the coffee pot itself works perfectly. Might also note that some of these reviews really refer to another model. This has no timer on it. You turn it on, you turn it off. And, at least for me, everything works perfectly.

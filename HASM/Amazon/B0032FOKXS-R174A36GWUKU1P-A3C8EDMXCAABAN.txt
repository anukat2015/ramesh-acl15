Title: Kostake
Content:
This laptop is really very good and I'm satisfied with it. But I do not understand how it can work up to 12 hours cos the maximum hours I've seen was 10 (I'm not telling I was constantly using it for 10 hours). There is a battery icon and clicking on this icon you can see how many more hours the laptop will work. With no any programs running, with 100% battery charged and "battery safe" settings ON the maximum hours I could see in that icon is 10.

Title: My first DSLR
Content:
I like the ability to use one camera to capture both stills and videos, so I haven't purchased a digital SLR until now. WOW, I LOVE this camera. I've been using it with a cheap, generic 150x SDHC card and the multi shot mode shots so fast, it's like having movies... amazing.
I understand that Canon does not include very good lenses with their kits, but this sure takes nice pictures, Way better than a good pocket digital camera. The colors are bright and true, even in low light and REALLY sharp and detailed. Movies in low light can be dark, but you can auto focus even in movie mode; and of course, since the zoom is manual, you can zoom in movie mode too.
It's really easy to figure out how to use, manual or auto with all the special shot modes. I never opened the manual to set it up and start using everything on it.
It's pretty small for an SLR and very comfortable to carry around.
I thought the camera was pretty expensive. Some here say it's a good price; after using it I can easily see why.
It is the easiest, more complete DSLR you can get for the money and I just love it. I'm so glad I decided to get it. You can't go wrong with a Canon.

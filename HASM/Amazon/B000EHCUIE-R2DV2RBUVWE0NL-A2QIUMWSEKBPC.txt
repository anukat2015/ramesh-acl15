Title: Great Non-IPod option for Windows XP Users
Content:
I recently ordered this product after months of research as to the right PMP for me. Im a WindowsXP MC user, who prefers WMP to iTunes, and especially love the ability to 'drag and drop' files directly to my GigaBeat as I have an external HD I take from, and dont have time to library all 250gigs of MP3 files.
My initial impressions are extremely high. Ive found the interface to be seamless for anyone who uses a Windows OS, and the folder layouts and navigation to be perfect. It does take a little bit of getting used to (going side to side with a menu across the top etc), but I wouldnt trade it.
The video/picture quality is better than I expected after reviews. I have not had time to test a darker movie yet, but all signs point to not having to worry when I do. The picture is clear and bright -- and plenty clear enough to see in daytime or darkness. 
The buttons on the side seem well placed to me, though I expect to be more comfortable after I memorize their placements.
Id prefer more background and color options than the standard windows background, and grey visual during mp3 play. But it doesn't affect the usage of the product at all.
I wouldnt have minded the scroll wheel found on ipods and recent ripoffs, but find the crosshair option found on the Gigabeat plenty sufficient. Its just not as 'fun'.
Ive had no issues with the battery life during music play.
The only downside to the player Ive found so far is the lack of made-for accessories. Cases are starting to be made in low supply, but otherwise your options are to look of Ipod capable items (cables etc), and hoping they fit.
I only wish they had the 60gig version available in white.

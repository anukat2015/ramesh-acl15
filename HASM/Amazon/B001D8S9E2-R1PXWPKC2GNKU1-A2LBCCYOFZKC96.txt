Title: Everything I expected and more
Content:
This is my first laptop and my first mac. I already had an ipod and an iphone, and I was sold on the software and intuitiveness of it all. Being a PC user my whole life, I was a bit intimidated to get a Mac. However, after going full speed into it, I was up and comfortable after only a few days. I am officially sold. All future computers will be macs. I also now greatly regret getting my mom a new dell with vista on it a year ago. I nearly got her a mac but was worried because I didn't know the OS... turns out that I knew the OS of vista no better. Her next Christmas present will be a mac mini and an ipod touch.

Title: I love it!!!!!
Content:
I received this IPOD in January 2010 and it is awesome.  The screen quality is great.  The settings are good as far as locking it and setting picture backgrounds.  There are a ton of good free apps available for easy download.  I wish it had a camera and the battery life isnt great but those are the only slight negatives I have.

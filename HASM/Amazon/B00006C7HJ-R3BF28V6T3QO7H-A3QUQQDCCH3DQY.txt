Title: Disappointing Product Support
Content:
I just purchased my third Vornado Vortex Whole Room Heater in three years. The shortcoming is with the heating coils...the base of the coil breaks, the coil becomes loose from its mounting, representing a potential fire hazard.  The unit must be factory serviced at...nearly the cost of buying new...I like the design controls and quiet operation.  The VH2 heating coils are identical to the earlier VH model, so I don't expect these to last any longer - less than a year - before they represent the same hazard. Vornado warranty offered no re-design or retro-fit solution. This is a potential fire hazard so if  you buy this, keep an eye on the coils for any breakage or insulators that have come loose.

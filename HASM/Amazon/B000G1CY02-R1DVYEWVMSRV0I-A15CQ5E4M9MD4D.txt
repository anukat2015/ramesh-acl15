Title: serviceable
Content:
pros:
-heat is pleasant and warm if you're within 3 feet of the heater
-wheels!
-slim and compact
-silent except for the slightly alarming cracking sound when you turn on the heater for the first time. this goes away, and eventually you can't hear a thing. 
cons:
-no on/off switch--you have to pull the plug to fully turn off the unit.
-only radiates heat to the front and slightly to the top and bottom. so if you happen to be sitting on the couch and want to feel the heat, you're out of luck and will only be able to warm your legs. this could be solved if they only added a tilt-fuction, which leads me to another con:
-no tilting capabilities
it does the job i need it to since i keep it close by, but i don't think it would work well to warm the entire room.

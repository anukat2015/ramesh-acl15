Title: Outstanding quality
Content:
The Canon 40D is an amazing camera for the money. So much better than any point-and-shoot on the market, but yet does have auto features on it that do the same.  This camera is really not for beginners unless you have the time and patience to concentrate on learning and practice, practice, practice.  I shot over 900 pictures to achieve the best results in one particular set of parameters before I was satisfied.  But once achieved, WOW.  What particularly caught my attention about this camera is that they separated the menu selection buttons onto a round wheel you turn, rather than those frustrating right/left/up/down selector buttons on almost every camera body..."I have always hated trying to push the edge of a wheel without pushing the middle button."  That easy-to-use menu selection system really sealed the deal for me.  Another big deal was the Image Stabilization is in the lens and not the body.  That means that what you see in the view finder is exactly what you get on the picture. If you find the view finder is too close to the display and your nose is squashed, I purchased an eye-piece 0.5" extension and removed the lens pieces before I attached it to the camera, thus creating an extended hood without reducing the image in the viewfinder.  I am so happy with this camera and would have spent more for it.  Enjoy.

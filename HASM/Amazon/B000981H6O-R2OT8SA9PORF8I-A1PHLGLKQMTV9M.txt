Title: Picks up spills
Content:
This hand held vacum is exactly what I was looking for.  It picks up spills from coffee grinds to juice.  It has a powerful suction if recharged regularly.  I would recomend this product to someone looking for something to use in the kitchen and/or the bathroom for small mishaps.  The only draw back is the transparency of the device, you can see everything that you pick up.

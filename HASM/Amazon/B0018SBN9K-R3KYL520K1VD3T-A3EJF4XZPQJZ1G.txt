Title: Cute little player, but only accepts MP3 and WAV files
Content:
I purchased this for my son's 6th birthday.  It is a pretty nifty player that my son enjoys.  Since this is only my son's first MP3 player, I didn't want something overly difficult for him to handle, as well as something overly priced.  I like that it can be listened to via ear buds or through its speaker.  The shaking function to randomly change songs is fun, but you can twist the bottom ring to access music more specifically.  Another feature I like is a little drum roll sound is used to definitely let the child know that they are turning the device on or off. These are the positives.  The one BIG negative is that it only accepts MP3 and WAV files.  This is annoying for me since most of my audio files are in WMA files.  I had to download a free application from the net to convert my WMA files to MP3.  This is irritating and time consuming.  Also, anything I have downloaded in WMA format via the internet and has a DRM, I cannot convert it to MP3.  So, in summary, the player is pretty decent, but be aware of its file format limitations.

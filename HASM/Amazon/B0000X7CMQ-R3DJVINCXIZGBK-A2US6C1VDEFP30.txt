Title: Disappointing
Content:
After reviewing coffee makers with insulated carafes I chose the Zojirushi EC-BD15 because of the many positive reviews; particularly the ones about the quality of brewed coffee and the coffee staying hot for a long time.I was VERY disappointed when I unwrapped the coffee maker.The plastic is very cheap looking.The whole thing is really lightweight and the "lid" for the carafe is a cheap piece of plastic that one just places on top! The brew basket is so small that a #4 filter sticks out on top.If this coffee maker would make great coffee and keep it hot for at least 4 hours I would have overlooked all of the above.BUT the coffee is mediocre and the carafe keeps it only WARM not hot for a few hours.BTW I am using the same coffee that I used with my previous coffee maker (that died),a Melitta "ChocoLatte",that I bought years ago at a discount store and that brewed great coffee into an insulated carafe that kept it hot for 8 hours.Unfortunately that machine is no longer available.I am trying to return the Zojirushi and go back to my good old coffee press using the carafe from my old coffee maker to keep it hot.

Title: Best deal
Content:
I'd been scoping out digital SLRs for a while, reading up extensively on the technical reviews, and finally chose the Olympus E500 over the equivalent Nikon and Canon.  What sold me on it was the relatively identical quality shots produced, the lower price, and the new Four-Thirds system, which I think really sets it apart from the other digital SLRs out there (if you're not familiar with 4/3, PLEASE read up on it).  Battery life has been awesome, even with lots of flash and LCD reviewing.
There's two things I would change about it:  
Autofocus in low light - you can use the annoying strobe flash to aid it, but otherwise it doesn't focus well, which surprises me because my Olympus C-60 has no issue with this.
Lack of a "Supermacro" - this is understandable as you can get a macro lens for it, but again, the lesser model C-60 has this feature built in, and so if I need to get a super close shot, I revert back to my C-60!

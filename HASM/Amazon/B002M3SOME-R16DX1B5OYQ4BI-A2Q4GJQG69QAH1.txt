Title: Apple F*'ed-up On This One!
Content:
Apple's design mojo is LEGENDARY -- so you kind of take it for granted that when Apple releases a product they have thought it through, end-to-end.  Not so in the case of the iPod Shuffle 4th Generation.
For starters -- what was wrong with the iPod Shuffle 2Gen/3Gen?  It was small.  You could wear it on your lapel and it simply worked.  The controls were minimalist -- which is just fine if you planned to sweat.
So Apple DISCONTINUES a perfectly functional working product -- never mind the fact you've bought all sorts of adapters and accessories -- and they replace it with a new player the size of a money clip.  OK.  But it has no controls.  Instead, you've got, basically, a "CLICKER" on the headphones wire -- the area which is notoriously sweaty -- and it controls all functions via multi-clicks -- e.g. click once to play, click twice to rewind, click and hold to advance, simply hold to hear song title.  And a synthetic human voice now tells you which song and/or playlist is currently playing (clever enough, I admit).
For runners this is VERY clumsy to manipulate -- especially when running full stride.  But the clicker control >>> IS NOT WATERPROOF &lt;&lt;&lt; -- I've bought and returned 2 shuffles and can conclusively say that the smallest dew-drop of sweat will short-circuit this controller.  So you're 20 minutes into a 60 minute workout and all you hear when you press play is "Boink.  All songs.  Boink.  All songs. Boink. All songs. ..."
Like I said I returned all my 4th Gen shuffles and bought refurb 2 Gens from the Apple Store. 
Design for design's sake leads to crappy "prototypes" like this one.  Don't waste your money!

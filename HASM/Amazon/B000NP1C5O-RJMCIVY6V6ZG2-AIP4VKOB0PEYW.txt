Title: OK, there may be focus issues, but this camera is still awesome
Content:
Not to contradict R. Herbert who did the first review of this camera, there do appear to be some issues on the SERVO focusing on Some Lenses and Some focusing conditions.
However there are several photographers out there that have not run into any focusing issues (I'm one) and we are all sure that Canon will look into the issue and come out with a fix.
Meanwhile if you are considering this camera I would suggest that you don't let this issues turn you away from in unless you plan to shoot track and field events in the next couple of months.
The advantages of this camera over almost any other cameras in the market is amazing.
Clean ISO 3200 and a very useable ISO 6400, 10 frames per second shooting, Live view (it works!), new light battery that seems to last forever, real wheather sealed body, more customizeable options that you can think of...
What else?  14-Bit images, highlight priority mode, fine tuning of all your lenses' focusing, dual card shooting...
I had been thinking about a 5D, however when this camera came out I was amazed at all the available functions and decided to forego the full frame (Sensor size is 28.1 x 18.7 mm, a 1.28 crop factor) and go for this beauty.
If you can afford it and are considering it (and you can find one) by all means go for it, you won't be dissapointed.

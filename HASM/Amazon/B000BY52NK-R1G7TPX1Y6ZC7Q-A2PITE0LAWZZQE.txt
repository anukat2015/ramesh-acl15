Title: Well worth the money
Content:
I'm still figuring out a lot of the functions, but damn this camera takes really good pictures. The high-speed continuous shooting feature is amazing.
My only complaint is that it's a bit heavy ... prob standard for all cameras like this, but when you're moving from one of those typical compact little digital cameras to this, it's a big jump!

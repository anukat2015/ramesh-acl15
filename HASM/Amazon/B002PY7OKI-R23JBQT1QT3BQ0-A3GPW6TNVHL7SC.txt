Title: The most fingerprint-friendly laptop in history
Content:
The Dell 1545 Gloss Black laptop has one technological advance that you may not have heard of, and that is the gloss black computer case, and the equally advanced matte black top. Several years ago, scientists discovered a way to make a plastic that was impossible to touch without creating glaring fingerprints. Nobody knew what to do with this material until Dell decided to make a computer out of it. When you first open the laptop, the gloss black finish is very handsome. However, once it is touched, it gathers fingerprints and smudges like no other material I've ever seen. So that is one caveat for the user: Do not touch the computer anywhere but on the keyboard so that it will stay clean. Not even the mouse pad. This can be challenging, but by holding your palms above the keyboard and getting an extensive routine of surgeries to realign your wrists, you can type on the computer without creating a mass of greasy fingerprints and smudges.
The case top also has the amazing ability to not only capture fingerprints, but to keep them despite vigorous polishing. I am impressed with this new material, which is I believe called "EternalPrint", which was apparently designed to capture the prints of criminals permanently on a plastic medium. Do not commit any crimes while using the Dell 1545, for God's sake, because the law will need only to confiscate your laptop to get all the fingerprints they need.

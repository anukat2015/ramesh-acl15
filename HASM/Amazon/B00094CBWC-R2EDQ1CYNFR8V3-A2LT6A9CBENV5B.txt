Title: Great for heating a bedroom
Content:
The Holmes HFH2986-U is whisper quiet, as advertised.  I've tried several other heathers but the fans have all been too noisy for use in a sleeping area.  I liked the earlier model a little more because it had a temperature dial to provide a more flexible temperature adjustment but it's no longer available.  This new model certainly deserves four stars.

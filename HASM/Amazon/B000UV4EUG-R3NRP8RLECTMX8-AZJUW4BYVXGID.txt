Title: Pretty Cool Mp3 Player
Content:
I've had this Mp3 player for about 2 years. Back when I bought it I got a four gig for about this same price.
I think it's a great product and beats out the apple ipod any day. The price is cheap considering all the features you get:
8 GB memory
Album Art
Voice Recording - Up to 10 min
Video Player
Radio Player
Organizer
Calandar
SD Slot
It's lasted me through the years and I've had minimal problems with it. I was kinda dissapointed with the SD card as to the fact that it doesnt add to ur internal memory.. and you cant play protected videos on ur player with it. But that's not that big of a deal...at least for me. Other people can be more picky about it I suppose. Also if your player starts acting a little goofy ( as mine did after about a year and a half) you can visit the creative site and they have a MP# recovery tool that updates the firmware and should fix all problems. The software is alright, kind of slow... but I can deal. :)
Overall this product is very entertaining, satisfying, and worth the price ! I'm definitely planning to keep mine for as long as I can and when I have to eventually buy a new one, I might try out one of the "newer versions" of Zen which might be 5 years old by then lol

Title: Avoid at all costs!
Content:
After just one month of operation, I started experiencing major problems with this unit. First, the water pump broke, then the compressor got really loud until finally, it stopped blowing cold air altogether. You would think this shouldn't be a problem to fix as it was still under warranty, I was wrong. Frigidaire customer support is the worst. First they send me an "authorized Frigidaire representative" who tells me up front he does not know anything about the unit. He took it with him. After hearing nothing for two weeks, I contacted Frigidaire again only to learn they don't have the parts to fix this because this is a 2004 model. (Guess Amazon sells outdated goods). They then told me they'll call me back when they decide if I "deserve" a new unit or not. They suggested I contact Amazon and "try" to get a refund from them. I don't think Frigidaire knows the meaning of their "guarantee". I will post another update if and when Frigidaire or Amazon decide to resolve my situation.
Update: Frigidaire ended up honoring the warranty, and issued me a full refund.

Title: Best canister vacuum for your money!
Content:
I bought this to replace a Eureka upright, designed to vacuum carpeted apartment floors, but hardwood floors in my new house - not so much.
I read many reviews of this Eureka Mighty Mite, on here and elsewhere, and despite some negative details mentioned by other buyers, took the chance and bought it.
I LOVE THIS VACUUM.  IT WAS WELL WORTH MY MONEY.
It's lightweight, the suction is fantastic, the attachments are great - the air turbined powerpaw is a cool tool - especially for cat-haired couches, and fur-lined cat trees!
Someone disliked the pressure-fittings - well, I find them convenient to disconnect when I want to go for a cobweb.  Someone disliked the "flimsy hose" - well, you can step on it, but it bounces back great.  Looks plenty tough to me.
I can't wait to buy a few more attachments; I can't wait to clean my car with it this Spring!

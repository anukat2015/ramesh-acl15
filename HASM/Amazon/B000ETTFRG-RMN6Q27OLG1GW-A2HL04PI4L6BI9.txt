Title: better than i-pod
Content:
there are a few problems with this item that i think most people should be able to deal with. occassionally it freezes up, sometimes in a very inconvenient spot. it only takes a few seconds to reboot and pick up up right where you left off. the more songs you get the harder it is to navigate quicky. the radio is good enough as long as your in a big city. i have tried the trick of leaving the chord plugged into the player for better reception, but that doesn't seem to make a noticeable difference. let's be honest though you don't buy this thing for the radio. that is just an added bonus. that seems to be the main problems with mine and the freezing up of mine, i honestly think i got some bad files on there. the player is a good quality player. the battery seems to last forever, unlike the ipod that most people comlain that thier's last around five hours max. i also suggest if you buy this that you also buy the rubber cover for it. mine stays in my pocket with keys, change, and other stuff and it still looks almost brand new.

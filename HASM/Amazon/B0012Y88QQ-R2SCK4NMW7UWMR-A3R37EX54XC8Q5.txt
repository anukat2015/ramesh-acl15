Title: does the job
Content:
After a lot of research, customer satisfaction posts, reviews, etc I decided on this camera.   I am a typical middle class working stiff.  I can afford what I can, and wanted a quality camera for a modest price.   This is it.   Takes great photos with really good battery life.   The image stabilizer feature is worth its weight in gold.  Its not a miracle worker, but really helps on the "camera shake" that you get with some shots.
But it should be noted that no camera can take great pictures without the "taker" practicing.  While the little "purse" camera is almost idiot proof, this one is not.   You have to play with it and enjoy it.    It doesn't use film, has a warranty, and a ton of settings, so why not experiment with it.   I take the same photo with a dozen different settings and then see what the photos look like.  Practice makes perfect, and it doesn't cost you a penny to do it.
There are some great books printed for this particular camera that are a must.  Check the reviews here on Amazon and make your choices.
As you will find out by checking the various sites, there are accessories that will cost you thousands of dollars if you get carried away.  My suggestion is "stick to the basics".
And one more VERY important aspect to picture taking.   "A great photo is in the eyes of the beholder".
The "pro" photographer that lectures for an hour about everything that was done wrong when he looks at a photo taken, may be telling that to a person that thinks the photo looks "perfect".
Great camera with a lot of settings to get you in the ball park.

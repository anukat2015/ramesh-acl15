Title: Happy about the heater but the directions are a little arcane
Content:
The heater heats up the space well, but I am having trouble following the directions in the little handbook.  Written for people on the moon, I think.  Turning the device on is complicated and I haven't figured out why yet.  But, it's working, so that is the pay-off.

Title: Kool!
Content:
I got the iPod nano in september, but never had the time to write a review.  It is very cool.  When I first opened it, I was like "WOW!  Its THAT Small?!"  I thought it was bigger.  The only reason why i got an Ipod was b/c i was tired of seeing my LITTLE brother with his all the time (he has the shuffle, which is cool, too.).  It was annoying.  I am glad I got this.  It rocks.  A perfect gift for the music lover.

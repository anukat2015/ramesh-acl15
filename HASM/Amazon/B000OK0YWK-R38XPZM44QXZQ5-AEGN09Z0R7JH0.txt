Title: Simply the best.
Content:
Il start this by saying ive owned the creative m,ipod video 30 and 60 gigs and others.Hands down the Zune is the best ive used todate sound is excellent and video looks fantastic.
The Zune is easy to use and doesnt give you alot of settings you wont use.
sound quality is excellent and included zune software works great at syncing,i havent had a problem yet.just set folders to watch and your good to go.I would recomend the Zune to anyone looking for a great mp3 video player.

Title: Excellent for music!
Content:
This iPod was able to store a lot of my music.  So far, I have over 670 songs on it, with quite a bit of room still left over (and most of the songs I have on there are 4-5 minutes long!).  Not only that, but it's so easy to use!  Also, instead of paying for songs on iTunes, you can just rip music from your CDs, put them into iTunes, plug in your iPod, and it'll automatically put them in.  However, if you want to be able to make backups of your music so you don't have to go through all those CDs all over again, I'd recommend buying "PD+Rescue for iPod."  Since my laptop crashed, I lost all of my music in iTunes, and once I installed that software, I was able to transfer everything from my iPod back onto the computer.

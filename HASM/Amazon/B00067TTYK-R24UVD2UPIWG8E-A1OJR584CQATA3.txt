Title: I love my ZEN
Content:
I am very happy with my Zen Micro player.  I've read some of the reviews on this player and  I can't understand why some people are having problems with it.  The only thing that I can say that is negative, is that the earphones aren't the best.  I purchased some high quality Sony earphones and the sound is incredible.  The battery life is also good.  I have over 850 songs in the ZEN MICRO, and I have more space.  I think that creative may need to work out some the bugs that some of the people are complaining about.

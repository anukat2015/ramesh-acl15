Title: This is the vacuum cleaner to buy.
Content:
If you're shopping for a great vacuum cleaner, look no farther. This one is QUIET(YES IT IS!!), lightweight, compact, and infinitely adjustable in terms of the level of power you might require. It wheels around easily and can be carried with no difficulty. All fittings on the hose and attachments work securely. The cord rewind mechanism is fabulous. We have a lot of valuable Persian rugs here and the non-beating head on this machine is perfect for these low-pile rugs and bare wooden floors. The suction power is amazing (it will pick up your rugs if you let it) and is easy to vary by use of an on-hose regulator and/or another sliding switch on the machine itself. There is an indicator gauge for the level of debris bag fullness... and it really works! The only fault I have with this machine is that the 2 small attachments for crevices and upholstery do not have a secure storage spot on the unit, though they can be clipped onto the hose(not the best place for them). Other than that, this machine has made our house much cleaner than our old Eureka or Hoover machines ever did. Buy it!

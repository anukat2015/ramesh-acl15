Title: Best vacuum ever!
Content:
After buying an expensive new rug, I decided I needed to get a decent vacuum--they are hard to come by, in my experience. I thought about getting a Dyson, but worried about purchasing something relatively expensive without knowing how it would perform. So, I read the reviews here--and bought one, the canister model. It is easy to use (once you figure it out, lol), and it does a splendid job. Vacuuming is relatively effortless. As some here have said, the Dyson makes vacuuming fun. (I can't believe I said that!)

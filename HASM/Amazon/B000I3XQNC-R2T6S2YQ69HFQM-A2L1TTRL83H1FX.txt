Title: Great Camera!
Content:
This is my first adventure in the field of SLR photography. I have purchased digital point and shoot cameras before but, there is none I have used that even come close to the quality pictures I can take with the XTi. I have had this a month and have taken over 1000 pictures. Most just playing around with all the different functions there are to play with. I even took around 400 pictures a few weeks ago on a trip to Walt Disney World. I still used Disney's Photopass and had the pros take our pictures. I even gave them my camera and they took our picture with that and ours came out just as good as the pictures they took. I just left the camera on auto and portrate for most of the shots and they came out great.
I have had so much fun with this camera. I even borrowed a 75-300mm lens to see how that did, and for long shots this was great I used it mainly with a tripod. The kit lens was better for taking closer pictures. I really am glad I bought this lens as a kit instead of just purchasing the body and the 75-300mm lens which was recommended to me. I can't wait to get more toys for this camera...watch out one you try it you will get hooked! I did!!!

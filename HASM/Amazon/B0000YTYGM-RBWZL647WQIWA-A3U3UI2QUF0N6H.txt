Title: Disastrous
Content:
I purchased this coffeemaker a year ago, and if I averaged how many times it's overflowed, it would easily equal once a week! The lid has to be on "just right", (and it can look like it is) or its all over... literally.  Once it overflows, it is impossible to clean the coffee and grinds out because the drip basket is not removable.
Yes, the coffee does stay hot for a long time, however another major design flaw is the fact that you can't get your hand inside the carafe to clean it, and over time, residue builds up, a film forms and the coffee then smells and taste burnt.  When I soak the carafe, clumps of burnt coffee pour out.
Overall, this coffeemaker is a recipe for disaster.  I would not recommend it.

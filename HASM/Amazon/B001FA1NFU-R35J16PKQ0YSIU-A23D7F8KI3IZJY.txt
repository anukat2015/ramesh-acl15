Title: I will not buy another
Content:
This is my first IPod and it will be my last.  The instructions are worthless, as well as the support sites.
I am not one to write good or bad things about products I buy but to me this one is a waste of my good money.  No idea of how to download my music from other programs even though it tells me that I have music downloaded I can't get them to play.  First and last time for Apple for me.  LOL, I guess they do not read any of these comments, if they did then they would not keep producing items such as this.

Title: Got Heat
Content:
I use this in my shop which is not well insulated.  It takes the bitter cold off and gives a warming location.  Nice that you can run 1,2, or 3 burners on low, medium, or high for a variety of heat levels.  Nice and solid mount on the bbq tank.  Burns through the tank about as advertised, maybe 10 - 12 (guessing from limited use) hours or so on the high setting with all 3 burners on, scale down from there with the lower settings or less burners.
The only negative I see is that once you start more than one burner, and want to go to a lower number of burners running, you have to shut the whole thing down and let it cool and then light the burner(s) you want.  Frankly this doesn't happen to me as I need all 3 all the time for now.

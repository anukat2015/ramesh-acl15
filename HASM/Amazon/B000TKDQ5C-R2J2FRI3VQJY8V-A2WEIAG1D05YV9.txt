Title: works great for the money
Content:
Nothing more to be said than hasn't already been said by other reviewers, this is simply to add to the rating average. Just to reiterate, althought it's a little noisy, this heater does a great job of heating small areas quickly, and it's very compact. We've had it for about a year now, and it's been holding up fine.

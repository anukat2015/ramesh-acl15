Title: Excellent setup
Content:
I am very happy with this kit. Finally a kit that has a lens with decent range. I upgraded from a D50 and have not looked back. Nikon hit the target for the mid-range, prosumer market with the D90. I am still learning the capabilities of this camera and am suprised every time I discover something new. 
The body is well built and has a great feel in the hand. The in-camera focus motor is quiet on my non G lenses. ISOs above 800 are very usable with low noise. Coming from the D50, the viewfinder is bright and bigger. Buttons are positioned well and reachable. LCD is ultra sharp and huge. The video is not quite there yet but I did not get this body for the video. I wanted the CMOS sensor EXPEED. However, done just right, no quick movements, tripod use and a steady zoom hand, you can make some nice clips. I did find Windows Media Player has problems with the Nikon Codec. It is jerky and stumbles on playback. Just use another player like Quicktime or VLC Player. 
Battery life is definately shorter on this body compared to the D50, but VR on the 18-105 adds to the battery drain. 
I am glad I skipped the D80. This is not a classic Nikon, "add and X or S to it", update. It is a full blown new release. I would reccomend this body to anyone looking for affordable Gen II color. 
For me the big selling point was the built in AF motor. I have older D lenses that will not AF on the D5000, D40, and D60 and I did not want to replace them with G lenses.
Overall, solid body, built like a tank compared to the D50, very ergonomic and fast at most everything it does. I cannot scoff at the price since my only other option was the D300 for $600 more. The only thing I wish it had was the weather sealing that the D300 has. Besides that, I am totally happy with it.

Title: Best oil filled heater
Content:
I'd tried numerous heaters, primarily oil filled, in an effort to avoid high gas bills and the TRD0715T is simply the best.  I tried the Delonghi TRH0715, a Honeywell model from a "orange" home improvement store that's similar to the Delonghi MG15E, and a Soleus HM2-15R-32, all of them were worthless.  I use three of them to keep a 1,500 sg. ft. home with high ceilings warm.  When the outside temperature is above 40, the indoor temperature does not reach below 70 using the low or medium setting.  When it gets below 40 the high setting may be needed for about an hour.  The timer is very effective because you can have the units turn on an hour or two before you get home from work, similar to a programmable thermostat, and shut off later in the evening or in the morning after you leave for work.  As long as Amazon has these listed for $50 or less the TRD0715T is the best route for safe alternative heating.  They will reduce gas heating costs, I had a 70% reduction, and do not increase electric bills by that much, 10-20%.  The only heater that may be better is the Delonghi HM25E.

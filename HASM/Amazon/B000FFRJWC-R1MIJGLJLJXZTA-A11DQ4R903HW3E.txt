Title: Do Not Buy!  0 Stars For This!
Content:
I have only had this a little over two months and it has lost all of it self propelling power that I was initially impressed with. It sounds like it's struggling and dying and gives off a bad smell despite frequent filter cleanings and checking for blockage. What a waste of money! I thought for this price, it would last for at least 6 months without complaint. I wish I had the time to research before buying; so thought that I help everyone else out by including my experience. Eureka should be ashamed of making such a poor product. I thought this was a brand I could trust. They will be hearing from me. Update: We finally figured out that the belt needed to be changed...after a whole two months..pretty sad!

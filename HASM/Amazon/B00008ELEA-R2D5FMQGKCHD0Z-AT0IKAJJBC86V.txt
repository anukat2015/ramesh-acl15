Title: no paper taste
Content:
This percolator is everything I imagined...and more.  My purpose in buying it was so I could taste 'pure' coffee instead of paper filter...at a reasonable price.  It is all that plus the bonus is every time I see it sitting on my counter, I get to revisit the simple days of my childhood when my parents had this kind of percolator sitting on their counter, too.  Also, it is so easy to clean.

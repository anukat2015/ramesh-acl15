Title: Perfect for college student
Content:
I bought this coffee maker to take with me my freshman year of college. It's perfect for the busy mornings. I like how the filter is permenant and that it shuts off automatically. Perfect for making hot tea or hot chocolate, just remove the filter. Easy to clean and no mess at all. I can make my coffee and when I'm done drying my hair it's ready for me.

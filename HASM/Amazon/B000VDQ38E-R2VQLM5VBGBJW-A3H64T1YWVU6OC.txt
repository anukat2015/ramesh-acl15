Title: A lot of little problems add up.
Content:
I was looking for a vacuum that could handle kids and a dog. I don't have a big house or a lot of carpet so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. 
This vacuum worked pretty well for a while but several things bother me about this design.
* It is very heavy. I am in pretty good shape but it took a lot of effort to move this vacuum around. 
* After one or too uses I had to practically take the whole thing apart to improve suction.
* The cleaning of the dirt container is a very messy job. What is the point of the HEPA filter if a whole bunch of dust flies all over when you are emptying the dirt out? I had to vacuum more to clean up the mess left after emptying the dirt container.
* Finally, the height adjustment is now broken so the brush will not spin anymore. Which means the vacuum is pretty much useless. We checked on the internet for a fix but couldn't find one.
I would not buy again. Very Disappointed.

Title: Poor Customer Service
Content:
The machine has a poor design and is not able to exhaust water correctly from condensation. The drain for the machine is about 1 1/2" from the floor so it is not easy to set up a full time drain. I was told by the Whynter that maybe it was, "to humid to work in Portland, Oregon!" I guess this means that the unit sold in the Central, East Coast Northwest and Southern US will not work at all in those humid places!
I wanted to return the unit. They first wanted me to pay all of the shipping. Then they changed their minds. Since the box was damaged they said it would be OK to pack in a sturdy box to return. As a severely disabled person I was not able to do that and they would not pay to have the product picked up. I had not choice but to keep it and see if I could make it work. My care giver did put it on a stand so that it would drain continuously, but that is ridiculous for a product that is supposed to work as is!
The cooling was useless at first, but has improved. In reality I had to make the product work myself when it should have worked out of the box.
I am also afraid that this time AMAZON did not provide very good customer support either. That really disappointed me a lot!
I see now that Target is selling the product. I hope they tried it out in Minneapolis where their HQ is located. If what they had was anything like I received they should not be selling this product.
DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!

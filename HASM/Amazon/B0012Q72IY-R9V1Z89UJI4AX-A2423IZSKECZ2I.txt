Title: Great camera. Was able to use my old lenses easily
Content:
I purchased this camera for two reasons: [...] recommended it; and because I have a number of lenses for my Pentax ME Super. I did some research on the use of the older lenses with the K200 and the message was that you needed to do a lot of things to get a good picture with the combo of the camera and old lenses. This was not my experience! I was able to connect my lenses and by simply selecting the camera into manual mode was able to take great pictures without any hassle. The camera itsself is extremely robust albeit a bit heavy. I was recently at the OshKosh air show and with my camera and 80-200 (legacy lens) was able to take some awesome photos where I was able to see the expressions on pilots faces while flying by at great speed. Highly recommended.

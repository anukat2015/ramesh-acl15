Title: I'm still "Duh--longing" for a good heater from a company that cares!!!
Content:
I figured with the overall positive reviews, that DeLousy had simply addressed the obviously important/pertinent concerns raised by sub-par reviews.  Oops....was very presumptious of me.  Mine just arrived last week, and the actually packaging box was inside TWO other boxes....because even with rolls of packaging tape, the original box could barely hide the product from view.  The base-unit wheels had GRASS on them (so apparently a used product was sent to me (probably more attributable to a carefree distributor).  Then, I got to enjoy the "sticker-issue"....which took 45 minutes with "gentle adhesive remover," but which still removed the paint from this area of the unit.  I tried it for 3 days.......the "sparking issue" is a DEFINATE FIRE HAZARD if used on a carpeted surface (there are what look like cigarette or match-stick burns in the carpet at my office now. 
So, if anyone wants a re-re-used DuhLonghi Mica HHP1500, there is currently one on "re-sale" at my local Salvation Army Store.....and yes, I warned them about the product, and they said they would have their supervisor consider whether to sell-it with a warning...or just trash it.  Nice Product....and after hearing the reviews about customer service...it wasn't worth my time, energy or anticipated disgust/frustration even calling these dingle-berries.

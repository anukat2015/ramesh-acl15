Title: This coffee maker does everything great except one thing
Content:
This coffeemaker looks great and works well...everything is great except one thing..
it does not make a good cup of coffee.
The coffee is weak...it doesn't matter about the four brew sizes, they all make watered down coffee.....it is more like flavored water....
I tried different types of coffeee, I bought two of the containers where you can brew your own...it all comes out weak....
I really wanted to like this coffeemaker.  First, I have lots of other coffeemakers, but liked the idea of fast perfect coffee in the morning with no clean-up....30 seconds after waking up, a fresh brewed coffee, 
plus this is the most expensive coffee maker I have purchased....so I  wanted to love it... now I don't know what to do with it...its fast and easy...but the coffee is weak...tried green mountain, timothys, others....
i tried to convince myself that the coffee was good, but finally have to admit that it is weak coffee flavored water,
If you don't like this review, then I suggest you spend your $200 plus $20 per 2 boxes of k-cups.  After a week, you'll wish you had listened.
Update 12/23/2006....the coffee is okay at the smallest cup size.

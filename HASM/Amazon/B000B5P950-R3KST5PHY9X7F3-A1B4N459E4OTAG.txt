Title: Very well designed. No Problems
Content:
It's very handsome. I've had the coffee maker for over four weeks and I am very impressed. It's well designed and friendly to use. All of the elements are easy to understand and easy to clean. This one is quiet. The carafe, the measuring spoon, the water well, all the parts fit together with a kind of soft click that is very pleasant and well thought out.
If you are just out to make a pot of coffee you don't need this machine. It's expensive. However, if you are the kind of person that notices the little things throughout your day, it's a welcome addition.

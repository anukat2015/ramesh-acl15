Title: No More Earplugs
Content:
I finally decided to bite the bullet and get a quality vacuum after tiring of throw-away vacuums.  My previous was missing a wheel, hurt my back, and I had to wear earplugs to use.  I started to research quiet vacuums and the mysterious brand of Miele kept coming up.  I am sooo glad I splurged on this.  Here is why:
No more earplugs:  Everyone who has been in the house while I vacuumed has commented on how quiet it is.  I don't have to worry about waking the baby, and my cat no longer thinks that it will eat him.
No more sweating:  Long live the telescoping handle!  Finally a company that decided it isn't much fun to stoop and vacuum.  And I love the fancy swivel wheels that eliminate the feeling of dragging a sleeping dog around the house.
No more procrastinating:  It really is a pleasure to vacuum.  I don't dread the chore anymore, and vacuum much more often.  No more angry cleaning!
So many options!  I LOVE the various power settings.  I use this to clean everything:  appliances, drapes, upholstery.  And it is nice not to have to try to wrestle throw rugs into submission whilst vacuuming.
P.S. This model is great, because I think both the turbo and parquet tools are extremely useful.  
Happy Cleaning!

Title: Works fine for light usage.
Content:
I would recommend this if you have a very old grill with a quick release regulator: this adapter will allow you to hook your old grill up to a new standard tank. That said, I would not recommend this to someone who goes trough propane tanks on a weekly basis as this adapter is not made to be mounted and dismounted easily or efficiently.

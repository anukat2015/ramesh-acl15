Title: Very good product
Content:
Overall I love this coffee maker. If you use the little scooper it comes with and measure exactly it makes awesome coffee. Better than Dunkin Donuts. The only reason I didn't give it 4 starts is because my mom bought a cuisinart coffee maker with a thermal carafe that doesn't have the grind feature. Her coffee stays scalding hot all day long even after you pour a cup. This coffee maker does not keep coffe hot for very long. I'm a stay at home mom and I drink cups of coffee through out the day so I end up having to nuk my coffee. But that is my only complaint with it.

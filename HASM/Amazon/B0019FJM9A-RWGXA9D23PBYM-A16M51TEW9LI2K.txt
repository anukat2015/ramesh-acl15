Content:
A GREAT CAMERA FOR THE AMATEUR IF SERIOUS ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY, IT HAS AN AWFULLY LOT OF SETTINGS THAT CAN BE USED BUT TAKES A LOT OF STUDYING THE MANUAL TO MASTER ALL OF ITS POTENTIAL.
I HAVE YET TO EXPERIMENT WITH CONTROLLING WHITE BALANCE AND BRACKETING BUT I'M GETTING THERE.
THE PRICE GIVES MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK THAN THE MID-RANGE NIKON OR CANNON.

Title: Maybe for a pro
Content:
I bought an SLR to take very nice pictures without the shutter delay of a point and shoot. I was tired of getting pictures of everyone after the candles were blown out on the birthday cakes! This is not my first nice SLR but it's the first one that requires setting adjustments immediately out of the box and continual adjustment just to take good pictures. (Default takes really dark pictures) My previous cameras blew away my point and shoot but not this one. Reading on the web there are ways to account for this but they are a pain and should not have to be done.

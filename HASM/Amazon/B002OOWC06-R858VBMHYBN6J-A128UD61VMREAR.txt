Title: Toshiba makes a great product
Content:
This laptop performs as promised. The processing power is more than adequate for multi-tasking with I.E., e-mail and office products.  I also use it for video editing and love the HD quality of the videos.  Earlier reviews about weak speakers did prove to be correct, however user forums have addressed settings to overcome this.  The equalizer (once found) can be set effectively.  Battery life averages around 7 hours when using it fully, and the light weight makes it very portable.I love the RED color too!

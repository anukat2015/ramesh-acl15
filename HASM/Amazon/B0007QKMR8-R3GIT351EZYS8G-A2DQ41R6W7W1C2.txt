Title: Use in other than auto
Content:
I just returned from an Italy tour wherein I was confronted with personnel at the Vatican and other museums demanding no photos to be taken.  Not just flash but no photos at all.  When I got to the statue of David, I was not leaving until I got a picture.  With the camera set on AV priority I politely took a seat on a bench as though I was tired, and with a little care in positioning and being very still I clicked off nearly half a dozen shots.  Out of those I did find one that was not blurred and was reasonably composed.  The exposure was perfect and what little camera noise there was, was negligble. As a matter of fact, I was not disappointed with any of the pictures I had to take without flash.  There were a number of instances during daylight where the camera would flip up the flash.  I could not understand this until I tried to bypass the electronics by switching to manual and found the picture was much better with the flash than without.  On top of this, all my old Cannon SLR lenses fit right on the camera without an adapter.  Cannon, I love you for making this camera.

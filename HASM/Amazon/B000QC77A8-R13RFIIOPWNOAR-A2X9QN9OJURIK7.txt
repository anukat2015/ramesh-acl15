Title: Works great!
Content:
I bought this for my 2 year old son's 29X11 finished attic bedroom that with roof exposure was feeling a bit cooler than the rest of the house in late Fall. It's working out great. We are experiencing subzero temps now and his room is toasty warm within 30 minutes of turning it on and throughout the night. It's very quiet and unobtrusive.

Title: Wow does this thing pick up dirt
Content:
I just bought the pet hair eraser vacuum an hour ago, quickly assembled it, and vacuumed my entire apartment. Not only did it work great on the carpet, it was awesome at picking up hair on the wood floor. I have two pets, a cat and a dog, and my cat sheds hair like she is getting paid for it. The filter was easy to clean and the vacuum was extremely easy to maneuver. Compare to my old Eureka boss vacuum, this one was very light. My only complaint is that the vacuum is a bit loud. But for the job it does at the price, I can tolerate the noise.

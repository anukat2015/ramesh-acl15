Title: I think I'm in love...
Content:
I purchased this at a Wal-Mart store, but I always come to amazon to read customer reviews, so... I LOVE this heater.  I live in a basement where it's always a little more chilly.  It was easy to set up, I love that it tells you the current temp in the room, you can set it to the temp you want it to be and it will shut off when it gets 2 degrees above.  Then it turns back on when it drops 1 degree below.  It is super quiet.  It has an oscillating (sp?) feature that I love.  I live in a colder climate and I haven't had to put on my electric blanket yet because this thing keeps me toasty enough with just a sheet and a comforter!  Sometimes I even wake up in the middle of the night and turn it down a little bit.  The remote was a big seller for me because I hate to have to get out of bed for anything while I'm sleeping.  Great product, look no further!

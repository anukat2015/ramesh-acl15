Title: Good value
Content:
I bought Delonghi EW7707 oil filled radiator as my gas fired room heater was too noisy due to the fan. The unit was delivered in one day from Amazon with regular delivery.
I am delighted with its quiet operation and fairly high heat output, sufficient to keep warm a medium sized room in New York weather. The unit is easily portable as it is on wheels. It gave a slight smell during first few days of high power use, but the smell is hardly noticeable, and gone after a few days. I found the preset comfort heat button to be too hot a setting for my liking, and use the included thermostat at setting 4 (range 1 to 6). The unit is smart looking and does not look like a piece of hard ware.DeLonghi EW7707CM Oil-filled Radiator with ComforTemp Technology

Title: Amazingly user friendly
Content:
I just received my Cannon SLR and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I have read up on several reviews regarding this camera and I have to agree that the quality of the pictures are excellent. Canon is known for it's user friendliness and it hasn't failed yet. 
Since this is my first SLR purchase, I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't be overwhelmed with too many switches, buttons, etc. Even though I haven't read the manual yet, I have successfully experimented with various settings and I am impressed by the quality of the pictures thus far. I do plan on reading through the manual eventually to get more use out of the camera.  
Last weekend, I was at an outing and I was pleasantly surprised to see  a lot of people using the Cannon SLR Rebel Xsi series.  Obviously, this camera is a popular choice for a good reason.  I do believe that the money spent on this camera was well worth it.

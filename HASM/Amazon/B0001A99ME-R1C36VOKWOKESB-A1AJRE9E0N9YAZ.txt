Title: Bigger is NOT Better
Content:
The iPod Mini is SWEET!  Regular iPods are small, but this thing is tiny! It is easy to use and holds plenty of songs for my needs.  The sync option with iTunes is great!  The new scroll wheel is a vast improvement on the older version.  The Mini has also replaced the need to carry around CDs in my car.  But forget all that, the Mini is just plain cool.  It looks cool; it sounds cool; it even feels cool in your hand. I love technology and I would consider this my favorite purchase in the last year or two.  Be the envy of all your friends and buy the iPod Mini.  It is worth every penny.

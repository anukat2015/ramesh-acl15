Title: Agitator Cuts In and Out
Content:
Got the product today, put it together and started using it. When the agitator works, it is a great vacuum. But the agitator stops randomly when vacuuming and the button has to be pressed to maybe get it going again. This happens roughly every 5 to 10 seconds while using the product. I called Dyson, and I have to bring the vacuum in for repair 45 minutes away, and then drive back out again later to pick it up.

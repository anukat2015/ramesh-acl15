Title: The BEST coffee maker BY FAR!
Content:
If I had a nickel for every stinky coffee maker I have ever owned!  This is the perfect coffee maker-no mess, just great, HOT coffee.
My husband and I get up at different times and now we can both have fresh coffee, in the flavor we want!
  
I bought the B60 model instead of the B40 because I liked the fact it had a clock you could set to wake up and the cup size selection.  The only difference between the B60 and the B70 is that the B70 has a 12 ounce larger water capacity and an extra cup size (11.25 OZ.)  Well, that isn't enough of a difference for the $50 price increase.  I can just lift the lever and put it back down and push the small cup button (5.25 oz) for a second time and get within 3/4 of an ounce of the "extra large mug" size on the B70. 
The mechanism with the lever to open and close the Keurig is the only downside I found.  It seems a little cheap and flimsy-I just hope it hold up with repeated use.

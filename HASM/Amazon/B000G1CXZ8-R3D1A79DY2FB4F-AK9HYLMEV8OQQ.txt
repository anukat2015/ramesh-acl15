Title: Electrical Hazard
Content:
I owned this heater for one day and it fried the wiring in the bedroom it was in. When the heater turns on and off from the thermostat, be prepared for it to pull so many amps that it fries the circuit. Stay far away from this heater. If I could give it zero stars, I would.

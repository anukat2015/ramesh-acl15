Title: I now own two.
Content:
I bought one full price and one refurbished (for the office) and I love both.  Very easy to use, the self cleaning function is what I really appreciate.  I run the simple cleaning process every week and the coffee maker always brews fresh, clean coffee without that dirty bitter flavor found in most cups of office coffee.  My only caution is to be careful pouring the water into the maker -- the drain opening is rather small so be careful. Otherwise, a dependable coffee maker (I've had my first one for over a year) that looks great on the counter.

Title: I like it
Content:
I got this heater for my son's room.  I read the other reviews about the blue light and was prepared to break out the duct tape.  After the setting the temp in auto mode the blue light goes out.  There is susposed to be a red light on at the base of the heater to let you know it's plugged in, but it does not glow.  The heater does need to be reset if it's unplugged.  I mostly leave it alone though.  The heater is nearly silent and blows warm air, not hot air.  It makes some expansion noises too.  I don't know if the ionizer works as I don't have one without it to compare.  Overall I think this is a great buy and would definitely buy another if I needed one.

Title: Performs as advertised
Content:
I purchased this item with a some skepticism, but felt that the guarantee made it worthwhile to "check out".  
The heat is well-circulated, no "strange smells", exterior surfaces (of the heater) remain only slightly above room temperature, and my first electric bill after the purchase was a 25% reduction (I do not know how much of the reduction was diretly attributable to the heater).
     Having several conventional room heaters (hot oil recirculating, conventional electric element, standard quartz element, etc.), this is a definate improvement in quality and reduction in heating cost. 
     I have a friend who also purchased the same model for a store office with high ceilings and plenty of drafts.  The same people who are normally requesting to "turn on the heat" requested that the heat be turned down (they were too warm).

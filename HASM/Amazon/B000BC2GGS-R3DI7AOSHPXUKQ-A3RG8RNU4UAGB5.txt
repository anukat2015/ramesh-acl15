Title: Made winter wonderful
Content:
I have had this for about 2 months now. I live in an apt in Chicago that has very thin walls and drafty windows.
Last winter I was shivering with 2-3 blankets when I went to bed. We had the heat in the house but still did not heat my bedroom.
I bought this late October in fear for another bitter cold winter. And I must say, it has been my hero.
The Honeywell HZ519 Heater is easy enough to control and works well to heat the room. (Please read instructions though)
There's only one option I use, I think they have two. I set the temperature to my desired temperature and when it reaches it, it stops (not turns off). It'll start up again if the temperature drops.
The other option I believe is that it just stays on. There is also I believe a "safety" so it doesn't overheat.
CONS: It seems long (I think 4 feet wide). 
CONS: The other is the screen to set the temperature. It just seems very dark. It's readable just dark like an 80's Casio watch with no light.
Otherwise great product.

Title: Great Laptop good price!
Content:
Needed a good laptop for my family to use for internet, email, some gaming, and to work with home network useing wireless gateway. Was easy to set up and use right out of the box. Has the power I needed and more. Love the big keyboard and number pad. Never liked the side scroll on mouse pad on any laptop, was able to disable it in control panel. Sometimes view T.V. on internet, has the power for that and easy to see on that 15.6 inch screen. Had no problem hooking it up to living room T.V. with addapter, didn't have to fiddel with any setting and could view internet shows on T.V. screen too! And HP does great follow up for there products, emailed me to make shure my laptop was working fine and can get in touch with HP if I need any help from them, so far never needed to call for any help! I liked this product so much that when I needed to replace my old printer I whent with an HP printer with out question! And yes the HP printer works great and at a great price as well!

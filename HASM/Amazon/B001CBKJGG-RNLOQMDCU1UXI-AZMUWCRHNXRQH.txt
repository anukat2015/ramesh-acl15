Title: Great entry level DSLR!
Content:
In March, I decided to get into digital photography and purchase a DSLR. Because most of my friends are Canon users, I didn't have to make the usual decision between brands. The advice I received was to invest money in lenses instead of the camera body. This way, I could continue to use lenses as I advanced and also get higher quality shots with better glass. Also, with the minimum investment, if I could master the basics on the basic DSLR, I could upgrade in the future.
~20,000 shots later I am more than satisfied with the use of the XS. Remember how much you are paying. I also purchased the nifty fifty, Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens with the original purchase. Using that lens (along with the kit lens), I was able to learn a lot and develop my skills.
I had the dreaded Err99 problem about 1000 shots in, but within a week, I got my camera fixed from Canon. I've heard others with bad stories dealing with Canon customer service, but mine was perfect. I've now invested in other prime lenses. I may upgrade in the future for specs like better ISO noise management or faster shooting rates, but this camera is more than sufficient.
Regardless of the camera you end up choosing, just shoot (many) photos and learn from them. Learn from others. Learn from photographers all around the world (flickr, etc.) For me, Rebel XS was just the camera to bring me into the world of photography!
(don't forget to purchase UV filters to protect your lenses!)

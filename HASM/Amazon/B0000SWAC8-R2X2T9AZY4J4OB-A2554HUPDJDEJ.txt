Title: My favorite vacuum ever!
Content:
Having earned my pocket money as a maid during high school and college, I have used many vacuum cleaners that are difficult to lug around and just don't do what they're supposed to do.  I have had my Oxygen 6988A for almost a year, and I think I vacuum more than I ever did, because it is so easy to use.  I probably use this vacuum every other day.  It's light weight, so I don't dread pulling it out of the closet.  This vacuum also comes with the widest floor brush I have ever had, so it only takes a few minutes to zoom around the bare floors in the house and pick up all the pet hair.  I shopped for a good price on line, and I am very impressed with what I got for the money compared to other vacuums that cost significantly more.   This machine has a HEPA filter, a power brush for carpets, and the dusting brush and floor brush are horsehair rather than nylon.  You pay extra for those features with some other brands.  Very satisfied.

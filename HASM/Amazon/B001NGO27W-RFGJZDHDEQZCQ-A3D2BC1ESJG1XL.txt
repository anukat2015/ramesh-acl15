Title: Great coffe maker
Content:
I was looking at various models along with a few Cusinarts. Looked at Consumer Reports who gave a good rating to an earlier model however reviews of that model pointed out some short comings. After much research decided to buy the DCC-2600 and have not been disapointed. This model addressed the negative comments from the earlier models. I would suggest using the paper coffee filters which you purchase as an option unless your water is great tasting. Makes a great cup of coffee, easy to use , nice and hot etc. Have had this unit for about a month and would recommend it highly.  Cannot think of anything negative to say about it.

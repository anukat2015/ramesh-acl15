Title: Capacity to burn
Content:
Very happy with the 80G Classic. Holds my entire vinyl and CD collection and still have plenty of room for video, games, podcasts and photos. Had a 4g Nano which I quickly ran out of space. Love the portability of this device. Plug into the car, take it camping, traveling. Sound is great on newer updated releases thru Amazon & I tunes. Only negative I have found is volume level is not consistent among recordings. I use the device for music. Videos quality is good but not my choice for viewing. Love the various podcasts that are available.

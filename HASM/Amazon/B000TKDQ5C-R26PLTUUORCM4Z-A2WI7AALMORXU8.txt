Title: 2 Lasko Ceramic Heaters Going Strong
Content:
When one of our daughters and her family moved west, we let them take our 2 space heaters with them. Our woodstove just cannot keep up with NH temps, so I researched online and found this model from Lasko. The reviews looked excellent, and one of the heaters that went to CO was a ceramic heater (not Lasko) and it did a good job, so I ordered 2 of the Lasko 754200's. One of them keeps my home office warm quite well, especially since it has a stairwell going upstairs that is open to the room! The other one keeps our around-a-corner bathroom plenty warm when we want to take a shower, or when it's below freezing and we want to keep the pipes in there from getting too cold. We've had no problems with either of them and they are in daily use.

Title: Too difficult to use!
Content:
I couldnt agree more with the previous feedback. Way too HEAVY and the wheels were designed too straight so going around corners is awful or even turning. The hose also is set too high on the unit so pulling it is very difficult with the wheel and weight issue. 
The worst is opening up the unit to then have to touch and pick out all the guck you just sucked up. There is something said for a bag. YOU DONT HAVE TO TOUCH IT! It also clogs way too fast. I was only vacuuming for 5-10 mins before it got full. Super Drag!!! A woman on the go or a cleaning person did NOT design this machine. Too complicated and difficult and too long to get involved with. Test drive it or do your research.

Title: Amazon won't post my TWO STAR review!
Content:
I sent an honest review of the D200 giving it a two star rating.  Had the camera for 9 months.  It has focus/metering issues...numerous forums have reported soft focus from this camera.  This is not a camera for the amateur and some professionals.  I have looked at this sites collection of D200 pictures...they are not showing you the cameras real problem with focus.  Look at the yellow bird on the feeder, focus is not good, metering for the feeder shows up dark.  I shot 1000-2000 shots with this camera using tripod, remote switch and every setting you could imagine.  I could not get a consistant properly exposed/metered/in focus shot. I have read all the stellar reviews from quote professionals...BS.  I believe they are noticing the problem also but won't admit it.
I just looked at a shot from another D200 a friend has.  It is a portrait shot of a woman holding her child..side by side.  You can see where the focus point ended up not on their face but on the sholder of the childs right arm...the only thing that did not look soft was the childs shirt on his right sholder.   I hope Amazon reads this because they should post all reviews not just the ones that sell the camera.
I sold my D200 and upgraded to a Nikon D40.  Quick, effective and much better photo quality than the D200...don't care what anyone says it does a better job!

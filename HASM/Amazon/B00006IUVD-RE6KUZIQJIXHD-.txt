Title: Piece of junk, possible fire hazard
Content:
I received this as a gift and it hasn't worked correctly since day 1.  First of all, it does not shut off automatically, I have to actually unplug it from the wall to get it to shut off.  Secondly, it immediately starts brewing as soon as water is poured in, WITHOUT turning the unit on via the switch.  I don't think the on/off switch  functions and I wonder why they even bothered putting it on there since the only way to control the thing is to plug it in and unplug it from the wall.  This faulty switch makes me concerned about this being a fire hazard.  Lastly, the space to pour water into the resevoir is so small that it's difficult to do so without spilling it all over.  I called Black & Decker and they 1) didn't even attempt to troubleshoot the problems I described above and 2) wanted to charge me to send me a new unit.  Overall, good idea but very poorly implemented and extremely poor quality.  I hope it doesn't burn my house down as I write this review...

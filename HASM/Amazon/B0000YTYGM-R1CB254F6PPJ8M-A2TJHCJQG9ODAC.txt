Title: Best Coffee Maker you can buy.
Content:
I have had my coffee maker for 2 years now and have never,(not once) had it to spill all over the counter like others have claimed.  I do know that if you don't properly place the filter holder into it's carriage it will probably spill out, or if you don't properly place the carafe onto its platform, that could cause leakage.  When screwing the lid down on the carafe it is also important to tighten it as far as it will go.  This allows you to be able to pure the coffee into your cup better.
The only gripes I have is that you can't see the water level from the front.  It's very tall and hard to fit under the cabinets.  I also see no reason to have a beeper at the end of it's cycle.  Not much of a gripe and it's really not a problem though.
I can make coffee in the morning and it will stay hot for 3 to 3 and-a-half hours which is plenty of time for me to drink.  It will last longer than that if I run hot water into the carafe before making.
All in all this coffee maker is a real gem.  I had a Krups before this one and it seemed to take for ever to finish it's cycle and the coffee was never this good.  This Cuisinart has been well worth the money.

Title: Amazing Camera
Content:
I made the jump from a point and shoot to an SLR.  I wanted something where I could take pictures at car races and the like that is just beyond the point and shoot range.  I'm not a pro and don't have the budget or the justification for that kind of equipment but I like quality pictures and wanted to get the biggest bang for my buck.  I researched everything out there and settled on the Rebel XSi.  At 12 MP, the photos can be blown up to poster size and not look pixelated.  I'm happy with an 8x10 glossy so that ought to do.
Out of the box, it was a little confusing until I set down with the camera and the book.  In short order, I was taking pictures...No, I was creating art.  Man, what a difference from the point and shoot!  This thing takes unbelieveable pictures.  The detail is fantastic.  There is no doubt in my mind I made the right camera choice.  The camera is advanced enough for a pro but has auto setting so it becomes a fancy point and shoot with the bonus of vivid, sharp, detailed photos.
I really don't have anything negative to say about the camera.  Any time something didn't work right, I found it to be "operator error".  As I am still learning, when the shot really matters I put it in a program mode and it works every time.  Other times, I find myself playing with the settings and coming up with some interesting stuff.  When it doesn't work, hey, it's digital...delete it!

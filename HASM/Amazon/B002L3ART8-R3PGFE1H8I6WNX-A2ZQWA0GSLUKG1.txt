Title: Wasn't worth the money
Content:
My mother always used Electrolux since I can remember, (better than 30 years)and you couldn't beat the quality of the vacuum. I decided to purchase one after years of uprights.  I was very disappointed...The machine was very quiet and the vacuum heads manuevered around furniture well, but the biggest problem was the suction power.  I have solid colored plush carpets and the vacuum didn't have the power to clean them. After 3 months of dealing with it, I returned the vacuum.  I was fortunate to buy it at Lowe's and received a complete refund without any problems. Now I find myself researching vacuums and relying on reviews from others to make a better choice.

Title: it is very quiet
Content:
when i had to replace a cheaper older holmes space heater i had a choice of one for
15 dollars us vs this one for 30 plus dollars or about 40 with shipping because i
needed to warm up the room asap. heck what's 20 bucks anymore? im glad i got this
one becaise it is so quiet that it doubles as a low level white noise generator that
muffles the hum of urban street traffic in a main road a block away but not of course
loud power tools like leaf blowers. late at night its the nbext best thing to whisper
quiet tech we'll have someday. the trade off is its a little less effective than the
same standard 1600 watts with a stronger louder fan. this is a nice quiet way to take
the chill off winter nights in the sunbelt. if it were up north id get the least noisy
high speed fan and maybe two heaters to keep warm in freezing winters. if it were a permanent home it would be a no noise solar powered tech but great for temporary housing.
its not a big deal about pressing the button 8 times to go from on to off to on again.
its just dumb that none of these fake settings sets a thermostat or maybe i missed it
by not reading the directions? so it stays on all night but it hasnt broken so its
either too early or the low speed fan is under low stress and might last a year.
for my need for quiet warmth in a mild winter climate 5 stars. in general 3-4 stars.

Title: beautiful with functional warmth
Content:
I have been very pleased with my purchase.The heater looks wonderfully real and the heat is perfect for taking out the chill.The high/low feature is great for saving energy. The heater is safe and heats an area of about 1000 sq feet.(my entire upstairs)Iam so pleased with my stove that I know I will be getting another, maybe a larger model since I am moving to a larger home.

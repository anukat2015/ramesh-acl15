Title: disappointed
Content:
After about 6 months of use, this coffee maker quit.  I've had Cuisinart grind and brews in the past and didn't want to deal with the messy grounds and cleaning. The Capresso worked great and made a decent cup of coffee for a couple of months, then started slowing down and not brewing all of the water in the water tank.  Cleaned it, it worked well again for a couple of months then finally quit.  Also, inevitablly whenever the carafe was removed to pour coffee, several remaining drops from the basket would drip on the base.  I never had any problems with pouring or temperature as others have reported.  I was hoping this coffee maker would last at least 5 years.  My husband threw away the box, so I don't have any warrranty info.  Any suggestions?

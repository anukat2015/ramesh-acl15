Title: Good as New
Content:
This vac is super quiet, has great mobility and is a quality machine.  Only draw back is the "telescoping" wand, which is more trouble than its worth. The pluses are the extra long hose, the easily retracted cord, the wand push button controls and it weighs practically nothing. It works great on hardwood floors (wheels are cushioned to avoid scratches) and carpet, perfect for anyone that suffers from indoor allergies.

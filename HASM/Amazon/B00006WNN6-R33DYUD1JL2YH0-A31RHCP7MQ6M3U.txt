Title: Great product.
Content:
This is an excellent, low energy heater!  I have a large basement bedroom that this item heats up quite nicely.  It has NO problems heating the entire room, and even the adjacent bathroom.  My only complaint is the heat regulation is a little sporadic.  It's difficult to get the machine to put out the exact temperature you want.  I find myself adjusting the dial quite often.  Overall, this is a very impressive product.

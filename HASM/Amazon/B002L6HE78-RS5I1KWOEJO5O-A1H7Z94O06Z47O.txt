Title: Love Apple products.
Content:
I purchased the 5th gen Nano as a gift for my friend. I had purchased a 4th gen Nano (no video camera and smaller screen) for my daughter before and loved it but now she has an iPod Touch and she gave the Nano to her younger brother. Nano is great if you're an active person because is small, versatile, and also Apple did not increase the price when they added more features. 
We started with 1 Nano and 3 different brands of MP3 player in my household, now we have 3 iPod Touch and 1 Nano. You can't go wrong with Apple.

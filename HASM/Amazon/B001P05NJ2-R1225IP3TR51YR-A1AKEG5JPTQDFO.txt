Title: Great notebook
Content:
I purchased my first mac (First Gen Macbook Pro 2GHz, 2GB) in early 2006 and after that there was no returning back to Windows. The system was solid and the latest one is built more solid as a single unibody enclosure. The design is different than the previous model but the processor speed did not change much. May be that will happen during early 2009. After Apple announced the new model, I sold my Mac to www.gazelle.com and used that money to buy this one. I did get a good price for the older one from them. 
Regarding the review about this machine, there are lot of sites which have already done or are doing an extensive reviews. [...]They have a two-part review on this machine.  One more thing is that this machine does not have Firewire 400 port. I have a few Firewire hard drives and I purchased a FireWire 400 to 800 Adapter which is available here at Amazon or at other online stores.

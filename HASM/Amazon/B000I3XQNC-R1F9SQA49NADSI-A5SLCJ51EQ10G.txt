Title: Love it!
Content:
i love this camera.  my first SLR of any kind.  I have been using the hell out of it.  taking tons of picutres of my 9 week old son, my wife, everything... (taken almost 2000 pictures in less than a month).  not all of them have been ready for prime time and a lot have been just experimenting with and "learning" the camera, but that is the great thing abotu digital.  
Great camera to learn on and should give me plenty of room to grow.  software that comes with it works great as well.

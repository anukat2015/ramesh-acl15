Title: Good player, but some hardware complications
Content:
This is a really neat PMP, it has nice features, very easy to handle and looks very nice... 
But there are some issues that you must be aware when you buy one of these. 
- VERY difficult to connect to a PC, and I'm not a newbie when it comes to PC's. You won't have an easy time getting your computer to recognize it and being able to transfer some music into it.
- Cannot charge it with standard USB adaptors, this is one major flaw for CREATIVE. I own a 30 GB Ipod and can charge it wherever I go as long as I have a standard wall adapter, but you can't charge your zen without the ZEN adapter or a computer. C'mon, if you want to compete with Ipod's you should offer a lot more flexibility, that's what's gonna make you more popular among users... Are you listening CREATIVE????
- Last but not least, it's not bad enough not being able to charge your zen with a standard wall adapter, you still have to buy one FROM ZEN for around $30... Including a wall adapter would of been nice...
When it comes to playing music, watching videos (no MP4 :( ) and listening to the radio this PMP get's the job done decently. But when it comes to connecting it to a PC, tranfering music, and charging (portability) they still have some stuff to work on...

Title: Had to be returned
Content:
Would've been a good item (I'm still using an old 1GB Centon mp3 player.) I ordered this 4gb one as I wanted to put more songs into it (I only use it during workouts). Sound quality is decent (nothing spectacular), but my biggest problem with the unit I got was that it kept shutting off during my workout sessions and that was really annoying. I sent it back and Amazon sent me a refund. Thanks Amazon! I'll order another one, maybe one of those sansa clips.

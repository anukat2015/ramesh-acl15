Title: Safety First--Heat Last
Content:
I ordered this for use in the room my grandsons sleep in when they're here. Living on a severely limited income, I can't afford to heat the whole house and Soleus claimed this would meet my needs w/a highest rating for safety (auto turn off w/in seconds after tip-over). This is nice, except it becomes hot on the metal exterior (radiant heat) and is silent, as advertised by mfr., but does NOT heat an area as claimed. I sat for nearly 20 minutes waiting for the room to heat (10'X10') and was disappointed to learn it's not effective unless you're right next to it.
I would never recommend this product because it simply does NOT perform as claimed by Soleus. 2-way shipping is an expensive way to find this out.
I've since purchased the DeLonghi TCH8590ER 34-Inch Ceramic Tower Heater, which has no surface becoming too hot to be near, blows the heat, effectively heats the room quickly, has a remote, timer, auto function, temp control by degree choice, also shuts off nearly immediately if the button underneath and flush w/the placement surface is disturbed in any way. And - AND, this item is much lighter and immediately safe to move to another room w/o having to take care not to touch the hot metal surface.
Shame, shame, Soleus. I should've read more reviews. Buyer beware on this one.

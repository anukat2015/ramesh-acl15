Title: Pros and Cons
Content:
Pros:
(1) Right size - doesn't take too much floor space
(2) Safe -No sharp edges, exterior material that won't burn on touch
(3) Energy Saver - 3 Power settings & antifreeze settings
(4) Feel Right Temperature - Timer and 6 temperature settings to get the right amount of heat
(5) Right Price - good value for money, its worth what you are paying for
Cons:
(1) Cannot be used as a primary heater; it is unable to heat up a room on its own - it definitely a secondary heater to give that extra oomphf (it can be used as a primary heater in a small room or bathroom)
(2) Since it doesn't have a fan, it take some time to heat up from antifreeze setting

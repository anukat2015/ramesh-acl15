Title: A good heater...BUT....
Content:
It worked good for one winter  with daily on and off usage. I used it a few times this fall  and then  one of the 750  watt settings and the turbo fan  just stopped working. I  guess it was good while it lasted. I doubt if I  will buy this brand of heater again.

Title: Super vacuum clean for collie hair!!
Content:
we have four 70 lbs. collies who are in the house at night and when the weather is too cold or hot for them. You can imagine the amount of dog hair left behind after visits! I purchased a Bissell 9320 Pet Hair Eraser Dual Cyclonic. The afternoon it arrived, it was used on carpeting that had been vacuumed that morning. The residue left over from the morning cleaning filled the Bissell collection cup several times. What a marvelous machine compared to the Hoover it replaced. This 9320 Bissell is very easy to maneuver and user friendly. I paid $134.00, shipping included, on line. For the money, it is as efficient or more so than vacuums costing three or four times more.

Title: Electrolux's Reputation Continues As The Best Buy
Content:
I also grew up with Electrolux and always wanted one as good and as dependable as that medal cannister that we used to drag around the house.   It seemed as if I spend a lot of money on big, bulky, heavy vacuums that even with hepa filters and self propelling are just a lot to use.  I have used a cleaning service for years now and do not own a vacuum cleaner anymore. Just a large commercial one for the large bird cages. In the spirit of the recession I thought I could do my own cleaning.  What will I need?  A vacuum cleaner.
I have stone floors and wood floors with oriental carpets and kilims - which are flat weave carpets. My house is also two stories with a flight of stairs about 20 feet up.
I also have a lot of birds and 2 puppies.  So, I saw this vacuum.  14 lbs is easy to carry with that compact size and great handle. Going green makes me feel good, too. I used it today.  Wow.  The adjustible suction and noise control, light weight, adjustible heights and swivel everything - I could not believe how easy it was to use.  It picked up everything and I could easily go off the carpet onto stone or wood just by pushing the suction adjustment with my finger.The edge of the carpets did not get picked up in the suction moving off to the floor and it did not grab the threads on the edges, either.
Under cabinets, beds, chairs, flat up against the side of the wall without scratching.  Picked up bird seeds, hair, and a little dry puppy poo I missed on a carpet.  The variable noise control is a great idea around little animals.  My little pups tried to play with it.
Just perfect.  Thanks.

Title: D200 Nikon
Content:
This is a great camera for both amateur and pro alike.  The only fault I have found with it is the location of the AF-on button.  It is located where you would normally place your thumb when holding the camera grip with the right hand.  I have accidentally pressed this button several times turning on and off the auto focus.  As you can imagine when your panning with autofocus on then suddenly the auto focus is off may cause you to miss your shot.  I'll learn, but it hasn't been easy when trying to concentrate on the subjects, panning from one position to another.  If you have been a 35 mm Nikon owner, you'll love the interchangablitily of the lenses.  With the 1.6:1 ration between the non-digital and digital lenses you have in effect have the opportunity to gain some very high power photos.  As an example, I have a couple of lenses (70mm-200mm zoom, and fixed 300mm lens.  They now have an effective range of (112-320mm, and 480mm.  I still wouldn't toss the 35mm.  There is still a lot to be said for film, with very little danger of the major manufacutes of film products discontinuing film production.  There are still hundreds of millions of film shooters left when you consider the world market.  But is sure is great to have the digital camera to confirm a good shot.  I have even used the camera to verify the setting on my 35mm.  Nikon D200 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)

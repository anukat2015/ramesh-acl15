Title: Perfect Laptop
Content:
I owned my first ThinkPad in '98. Been sold on the line. Unfortunately, mine finally bit the dust. Since Lenovo took over the division, the ThinkPad line has gone to crap. So... I needed to look for alternative options. 
I found that buying a new laptop is a lot like buying new shoes. You can't just buy them online without trying them out. This laptop was an ergonomic fit, not to mention the features. If you're looking for plenty of keyboard space, a large (an awesome) display, 64 bit OS, 4 GB RAM, and a 500GB hard drive... this is it. The HDMI output doesn't suck either. 
Regardless, I'm happy with my purchase.

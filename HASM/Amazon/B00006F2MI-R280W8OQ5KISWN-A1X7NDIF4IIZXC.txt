Title: The downlow on this product.
Content:
Bottomline is it looks great and it makes great coffee if you use pregrind.The coffee stays hot for a long time in the thermal pot.The grinder wastes beans and coffee is weakened. I drink alot of coffee. a coffeeholic with a gourmet taste. I know Cuisineart and Mr. Coffee is no Cuisineart.

Title: Easy to use, great on laminate floors
Content:
Bought this as a second vacuum.  Wanted it to handle our laminate floors, which it has done beautifully!  Adjustable power is a nice feature.  Light and easy to handle.  Very easy to clean.  Only complaint is that the attachment for throw-rug (and presumably carpet) does a so-so job, thus the four (rather than five) star rating.  Overall, I do highly recommend the product.

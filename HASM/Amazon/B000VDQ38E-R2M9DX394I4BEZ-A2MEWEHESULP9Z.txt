Title: Expensive Disappointment
Content:
I recently purchased this vacuum and have to say that the product is an extreme disappointment.  Adding insult to injury, just previous to purchasing this item I had purchased a Bissell Revolution Lift-Off and LOVED it!!  Unfortunately, just months after purchasing it our movers either "lost" or "stole" my new vacuum as it was the last thing put on the truck for our cross-country move and then they conveniently "forgot" to list it in the inventory! Because they didn't have record of it, they refused to reimburse me.  I would have repurchased the Bissell Revolution Lift-Off again but it wasn't available for immediate purchase in my new location and I needed a vacuum immediately. So, I bought the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser instead.  I wish that I had waited.  
The Bissell Pet Hair Eraser in my experience does anything but erase pet hair but, rather, redistributes it all over the house.  The brush will not spin while in motion and the carpet level adjustor does not elevate accordingly, and carpet lint will not pick up.  Furthermore, the dustbin design is poor and creates a mess upon removal and the turbo-brush simply does not pick up hair, dust, or particles.  Ultimately for me this was a waste of money.  Comparing the Bissell Revolution Lift-Off to the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser, I'd rather have my Lift-Off back.  Bissell tends to make good products but for me this one was an expensive disappointment.

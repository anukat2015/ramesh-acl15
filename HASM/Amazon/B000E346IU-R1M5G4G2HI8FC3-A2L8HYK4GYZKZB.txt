Title: Small but mighty...
Content:
I wouldn't trade this for another heater.  It's great.  It's compact and quiet.  It's safe too.  I tried the "tip over" shut off feature and yes it works.
Another reviewer mentioned a smell... when the unit has been off for a while and  then turned on their is a minimal odor but it's gone in a minute or two.  It smells like the first time you use an iron.  No biggie.
I would recommend this, but shop around because I didn't pay this much for mine.

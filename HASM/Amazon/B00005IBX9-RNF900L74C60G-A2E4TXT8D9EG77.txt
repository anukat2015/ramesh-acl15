Title: The DCC1200 makes a great cup of coffee!
Content:
I had the cuisinart grind and brew. Did not like it. After two years the grinder started jaming and I could not pull it out to clean. The DCC 1200 has three settings low, med and high for heat. I always have a hot cup of brew and cleaning is much easier and the coffee tastes great.

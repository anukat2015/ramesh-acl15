Title: Good Coffee with No Frills
Content:
If you are a coffee drinker needing no bells and whistles, this machine is for you.  I don't ask much from a $20 coffee pot except a decent cup of coffee.  This Mr. Coffee delivers, and its design is a step up from our previous Mr. Coffee, which was also their cheapest model.  It would be nice if the company worked on a carafe that pours without spilling though.  I have never purchased any Mr. Coffee machines, cheap or expensive, that poured well.  Having owned other brands, I know it's not the person pouring.  Other than that, no problems.

Title: Smarter than me!
Content:
This is an incredible camera, far more sophisticated than my current skills warrant.  I am, however, learning. The biggest surprise, and shame on me for not researching it more carefully, is that this camera does not have an autoshoot setting.  The P setting is supposed to be similar but allows the photographer much more flexibility. While I'm glad I'm being forced to actually learn the mechanics of photography - aperature, f-stops, etc. -- as a newbie I've had some extremely frustrating moments, none of which were the fault of the camera. Fortunately two friends are professional photographers with the same camera and they're coaching me. The camera is relatively heavy, but it's beautifully balanced and  very comfortable to use. The 18-200 lens is absolutely amazing. I have to give the camera 5 stars if you're an experienced photographer. If you want a digital SLR that you can point and shoot, you probably should look at other options like the D80.

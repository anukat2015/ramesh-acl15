Title: Excellent product for the price
Content:
I got mine X5 a month ago, its defenetly worth the price bu It has some details.life is ar
Please sorry for my english, i will try my best but my natal language is spanish.
I will start from the Cons:
#The battery is around 7 or 8hr max with battery saving mode (no way it will last 12hr)
#After some weeks of use the battery is a little loose (it moves a little)
#The track Pad needs a little more friction some times but is not that bad.
#The Keyboard, it looks really nice, but when you put some preasure in the keys (like K J or L) the whole keyboard goes deeper..
#The desplay, its look good but you have to be excalty in front of the display beacuse if you look from any agle you want see anything.
Pros:
#It looks like a really expensive sony vaio. But cost around $650 with the rebate.
#Its fast, really fast.
#Its really cool and quiet, you wont feel any heat and noice at all.
#Its thin and ligth.
#Express Gate is a nice addition.
#No bloatware
#Win 7, really like it.
For the price, i think is on of the best notebooks in the market.

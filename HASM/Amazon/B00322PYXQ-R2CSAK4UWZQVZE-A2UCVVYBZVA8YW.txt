Title: Vaio, va-va-voom
Content:
I have one foot firmly in the Apple camp and another in the PC camp.  Don't argue with me, some things Windows just does better.  I had a smaller VAIO that lasted for 5 or 6 years before it blue-screened.  This is a wonderful, big, second workhorse for our wireless system at home.

Title: The Best of the Best!
Content:
This is the BEST coffee maker I have ever owned!  And I've tried them all!  It's not only top quality its a beautiful, elegant maker and very easy to handle.  I loved it so much that I orderd two of them.  One for my husband's coffee and one that I use to make green tea.  You won't be disappointed with this one!  If there was only one drawback it would be the spout for pouring.  Very annoying!  You have to pour VERY slowly!  The second pot I ordered had the newly designed spout which is great!

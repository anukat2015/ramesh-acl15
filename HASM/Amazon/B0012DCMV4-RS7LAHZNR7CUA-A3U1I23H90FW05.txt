Title: NOT WORTH ONE STAR
Content:
Comfort zone: After having are heater on for one full month we were able to do a comparison from last year with fuel bill and electric bill. Our's were set at 71 degrees and on 24 hour's each day. The electric increased $245.71. The fuel decreased (natural Gas) $52.20 so do the math. Since it only had a 30 day gaurantee the company will not refund our money. I am hearing the same thing from other people who have them. A much cheaper heater is just as good and at a much lower cost in heating. It is of my opinion they don't receive any star. Don't beleive it when they say less than $1.00 a day. It's closer to $8.00 a day. Buyer's Beware

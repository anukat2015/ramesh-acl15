Title: almost perfect SLR
Content:
I finally broke down, replaced by beloved Nikon FTN film SLR *and* my Canon A650 with a digital SLR from Sony.  I can't believe it took this long for someone to figure out that digital SLRs sorely lacked the live view features available on many digital point-and-shoots, and that the live view feature should facilitate waist-level and over-the-head shooting.  This Sony has that, and more.  For example, image stabilization is in the body, not the lens.  This enables the stabilization feature with a wide variety of "legacy" lenses from Minolta, Vivitar, Sigma, Tamron, etc.  
Yet the Sony Alpha is *almost*, but not quite perfect, hence only four stars.  The Alpha has two shortcomings; it is not available without the kit lens which, although it covers an adequate range, it's largest aperture is still small; it requires a proprietary battery and I prefer the ability to run down to a local convenience store when my camera runs out of juice.  Otherwise, the Sony Alpha is a total pleasure to own and to use, IMO far preferable to the competition from Canon and Nikon.

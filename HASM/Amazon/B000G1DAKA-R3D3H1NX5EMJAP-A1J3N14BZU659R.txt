Title: Great Entry-level DSLR - Excellent Features and Affordable
Content:
Having grown up using Pentax SLR Cameras and Lenses I was very intrigued by the K100D and the ability to reuse some of my K mount lenses.  I am extremely impressed so far with image quality, the built-in flash (no red eye problems so far) and the almost instantaneous shutter of the camera.  Having been oppressed for so long by the compact digital cameras I have reinvigorated my love of photography and can't wait to explore the many features of the K100D.  The auto-focus has been very good so far with just one occasion where it didn't seem to adjust properly, but that also could have been operator error.

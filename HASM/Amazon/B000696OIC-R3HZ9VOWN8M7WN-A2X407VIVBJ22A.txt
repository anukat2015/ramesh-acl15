Title: This is a great coffeemaker!
Content:
I don't know if I have a good 'copy' of this maker or if I am just using it properly, but mine has exhibited no symptoms like some others on here mention in their reviews.  
It has a large capacity and a thermos-style carafe, MUCH better than a glass or plastic container.  Coffee brews quick, and stays hot for a long time!  Cleanup is a breeze, just dump out the permanent filter, rinse the brewing mechanism, rinse the carafe and you are done!  
Now the downside - the buttons.  Due to this machine's nod towards simplistic times, it is somewhat lacking in buttons.  This makes it easy to brew a pot immediately, but setting the timer takes somewhat longer than neccessary.  
Overall, this is an A+ coffemaker, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a fine Italian coffemaker.

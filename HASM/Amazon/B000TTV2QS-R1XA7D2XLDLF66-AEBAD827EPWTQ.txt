Title: love this heater!
Content:
I'm one of those people who just can't tolerate the cold, my hands and feet are always cold due to bad circulation.   I keep the temperature at 75-80 degrees inside the house in the winter while everyone else is sweltering.  I've had several heaters in the past with a couple of them that cost twice as much and worked half as well and they always took too long to heat up.   Not this efficient little heater,  heats up right away!  Not to mention it hardly takes up any room which is a definite plus.  Now I can keep the house temperature at a normal level for everyone else and also lower the heating bill by having additional heat in the room I'm in with this heater.  Love the oscillating feature, it really circulates the heat well so there are no cold spots.  I've already purchased 2, one for the bedroom, one for the living room and I'm going to purchase a third for my work studio which is in the basement....a definite must have.  An incredible heater for the price!

Title: Totally amazing coffee maker!
Content:
Plenty of great reviews already, but I couldn't resist adding another because I really, really, really love this coffee maker! I owned a "Grind & Brew" before that made great-tasting coffee, but the prep and cleaning each day was my least favorite chore by far. Messy!
The Keurig B-70 is so simple to use, no daily cleaning is required, and the 5 or 6 coffee varieties I have tried so far have been excellent. As good as the "fresh ground and brewed" coffee I had before. Plus you can find the K-cups here on Amazon at great prices (do a net search for "Amazon coupon" and you can often get them even cheaper). My twice weekly Starbucks visits have been reduced to once in the past 2 months, so it has already paid for itself, and I love the convenience right at home. I can't recommend this coffee maker enough.

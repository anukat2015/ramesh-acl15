Title: Creative Zen 16gb
Content:
An excellent MP3 player.  I dropped my Zen Micro, and after looking at Creative's offerings, decided to go with the Zen.  Sound quality is excellent, ease of operation is the same as will the Zen Micro (very straightforward), and I like the big screen.  Battery life does not seem to be as long as advertised, but likely because I am not dimming the screen.  A nice MP3 player.

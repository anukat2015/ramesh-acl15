Title: Nice Unit
Content:
I've had the C100 for about a week now and am very happy with the way it cools and dehumidifies. Even the "low" setting is quite powerful and blasts cold air. The controls are easy to use. 
The rotary compressor did make a "clicking" sound when I first used it, but this disappeared after several hours of use and now works fine. 
I highly recommend it as a portable -

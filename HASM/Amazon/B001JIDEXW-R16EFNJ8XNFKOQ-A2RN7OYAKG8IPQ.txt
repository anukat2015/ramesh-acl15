Title: Great Little Player!
Content:
I'll be short. I am a music teacher, recently getting into the mp3 player revolution. I really like this unit. I've been a musician for 30+ years, so I am particular about sound. This unit sounds very good, and is very convenient. I picked up the 8mb version at Walmart for about $50.00. Good deal!

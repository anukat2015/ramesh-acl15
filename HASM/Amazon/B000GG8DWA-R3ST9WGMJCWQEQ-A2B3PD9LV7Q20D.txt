Title: Quiet personal heater
Content:
I've had this heater for over a year now and it's held up well.  It may not be what everyone is looking for (output lower than many others, no fan), but for my purposes it's perfect.  I use it in the colder months during my morning yoga practice.  The room I practice in is very large, and I don't think any space heater would adequately heat the entire room.  However, I can place this heater next to me and keep warm with the radiant heat.  It's also totally silent, which is great.

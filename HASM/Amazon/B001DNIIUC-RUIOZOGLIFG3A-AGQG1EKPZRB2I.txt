Title: Lasko 5572 Ceramic Tower Heater
Content:
We were looking for another space heater and a friend recommended the Lasko Ceramic Tower. We purchased a later model, and there were some improvements, such as the carring handle. It is light weight and easy to carry to different locations. It does a very good job of heating the room. We live in North West Tennessee and with the combination of another space heater, we have not used our furnace at all this year. The electric bill has dropped dramatically. We will be purchasing another Lasko next winter. Lasko 5572 Ceramic Tower Heater with Logic Center Remote Control

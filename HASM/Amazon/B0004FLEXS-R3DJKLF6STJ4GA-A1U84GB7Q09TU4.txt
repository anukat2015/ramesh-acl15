Title: SmartBrew coffeemaker
Content:
The SmartBrew coffeemaker recently purchased is our second one. The first one lasted 8 years. The programming is simple and convenient. Care must always be taken to seat the caraffe on the heating surface so as to disable the "sneak a cup" feature during brewing.
 Overall...a very good product for the cost.

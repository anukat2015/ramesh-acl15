Title: Problematic & too expensive
Content:
We buy premium whole bean coffees from around the world. We LOVE our coffee, so I decided to buy a premium coffee maker. The Capresso was touted as a high end coffee maker that produced great tasting coffee at the correct temperature. There were reports of leaking etc but I decided to try it anyway. Here is what I found:
While the coffee tastes great, the pot does drip condensed steam all the time. The water gets so hot during brewing, that some of it is boiled off as steam. So 4 cups measured ends up being 3 1/2 cups. The small pot program makes that even worse, and ads lots of time to the brewing process, 5-6+ minutes more sheeesh. Even with pre-warming the carafe, the coffee in the 2nd cup is noticeably cooler than the 1st cup. And finally, cleaning the carafe is almost impossible as the opening is too small to get your hand in to clean the pot! IMHO this pot is highly overrated & way over priced. It was an expensive learning experience for me. The pot is NOT a keeper and I will be looking for something better. The reason for 2 stars & not 1 is the coffee does taste great as long as you're patient and only judge the 1st cup.

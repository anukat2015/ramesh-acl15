Title: My first NEW camera
Content:
After starting out with a used Nikon D70 and then upgrading to the D80 which was also used, I was torn between A used D300 and a New D90. After much research, price comparisons, and reading some of the great reviews here at Amazon, the answer was clear. Many of the controls are similar to the D80 so there were only a few areas to learn about. As a fashion/glam photographer my main subjects are models in outdoor settings. Within a week of receiving the D90 I gave it a workout in 30+ degree weather. IT performed flawlessly!! NO fogging despite it not being weather proof like the D300. The images are brilliant, vibrant, and sharp. The exposure meter seems to be dead on. A highly recommend piece of equipment!!

Title: One drawback.
Content:
I've had this cleaner for about 6 months and so far I haven't experienced any of the problems others have had. The belt stays on, the controls work well and it does a great job on carpets. It picks up dirt that my old cleaner left behind. One of my reasons for purchasing this unit was because it was listed for pet hair removal. It does a great job at picking up the hair, but the dirt container is so small that I have to empty it two or three times for a single cleaning. Doesn't sound like much but I have a very small house. Overall this is a great cleaner but be prepared to empty the dirt container frequently.

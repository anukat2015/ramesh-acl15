Title: Great player for running and walking to work
Content:
SUMMARY:
*PROS*
- integrates perfectly with iTunes
- simple
- light
- plenty of space for regular listening
*CONS*
- could be a touch less expensive, though better than the first generation
- doesn't have a screen, but I'm surprisingly okay with that
*NOTE*
  When I got the shuffle, I only had USB1.1 ports on my computer.  This takes considerable time to reload music, which is something that I want to do fairly regularly with this type of player (for example, I have a different running mix than standard listening mix).  Now I have a USB 2.0 connection (through a powered PCI card) and changing my music content only take a few minutes max (for reloading the entire 1gb).
UNNECESSARILY VERBOSE VERSION:
Now for the longwinded, imprecise review because I spend too much time thinking about even mundane electronics purchases.
When the first iPod shuffle came out, I was somewhat skeptical about what the merits were of buying a screenless "ipod," particularly at it's near ipod mini price at the time.  Since that time, I have gotten a 20gb ipod photo, which I use regularly at the gym, and occasionaly in other cases (music is indispensible at the gym).  However, I have started running outside, and no matter what way you cut it, the standard ipods are a bit on the bulky side.
Now, my given the realization that while at the gym I rarely look at the screen (mostly just leave it on shuffle and occasionally fumble around to change tracks or the volume), my aversion to the shuffle lessoned considerably.  I then tried my girlfriend's newly purchased 1st generation shuffle one day at the gym, and loved it. Since I had some gift certificates to amazon, I took the plunge and got the shuffle.
It was an excellent decision.  It can hold far more music than I could possibly need at any one time, and it's battery life has never been an issue.  Its sound is quite good (not amazing, but quite good).  It is extremely convenient and lightweight to carry around or clip on when going running.  And its last major selling point over other flash players that I was considering is that it integrates seemlessly with itunes (where I have all of my music, including some purchased from their store, which I can't play on pretty much any other player).  I find that to be a general nusence.  But given that that's where I am, and that I really like iTunes, an Apple product has a significant edge over others to me.  In my mind, if the player was about half it's current price, it would be a no-brainer 5 stars.  But given that I got it with gift certificates, and that it is still quite good, I'll let that slide for now.

Title: Totally Awesome!!
Content:
I just got my nano yesterday in green, and have it loaded with music and audiobooks.  This is my second nano, and I could not be more pleased with everything about it.  I really like the shake and shuffle feature.  That is too cool for words.  I am SOOOOO happy they came back with this particular style.  I was not going to buy a new one with the 3rd generation design. It is thiner than the older nano of the same shape, and has a larger window.  IPod really does rock when it comes to style, colors, and cool features.  There are other features on it like Genius that I have not tried yet.  All in all it has everything you want and more with a great shape!!

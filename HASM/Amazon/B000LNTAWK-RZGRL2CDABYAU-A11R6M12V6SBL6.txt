Title: Fantastic
Content:
Use of use, great pictures, and now a lower price.  Faced with upgrading my old D70, I chose the D200 over the D90 because of the non-menu driven interface.  For example, I can change the ISO with a touch of a button instead of meandering through a maze of drop down menus.  Solid construction and more resolution than I really need (perfectly good enlargements at 8x10), how can you go wrong?

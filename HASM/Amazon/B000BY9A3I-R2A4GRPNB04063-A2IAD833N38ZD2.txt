Title: Happy with this Product
Content:
Very good vacuum that lasted a long time and continues to be great. Better for spaces that have wooden floors. It is not really really strong on carpets, but does get the job done. Very easy to empty. Cord doesn't get tangled and retracts easily into the vacuum. I recommend this Dirt Devil.

Title: You just can't compare it to the ipod anymore
Content:
The zune is such a great device. I am very happy with it after owning a lot of things including the gigabeat s and the ipod. Now what I like about this over the ipod is that the screen is bigger and it has a bigger color variety. As to were the ipod screen is smaller but still big and it only has two colors.I mean sure you can say "what about the new nanos and the minis" but we are not trying to compare the zune to them, because the zune will blow them out the water.Apple needs to step the ipod up with more colors, white and black are getting stale. Also I like how the zune does not get scratches or finger prints easily. Were the ipod is a huge magnet for both. The zune also has limited editon items like the red,baby pink,orange,hot pink,and halo 3 editions. And those are just to name a few.What does the ipod have, I dont know the U2 edition. Now everyone complains about wifi but think, you have to start somewhere and better to have wifi than no wifi. The feature will be implemented more in the future and with all the hackers and whatnot out there it might be possilbe for them to create a custom firmware for the zune so it can use internet or something. Now that's what I like about ipod over zune, the fact that it has custom firmware like ipodlinux and rockbox. I liked playing mario and stuff on it. But the only reason why zune does not have that is because it's still new and the ipod has been out for years. So just give it time.

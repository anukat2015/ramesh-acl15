Title: AS 1810TZ Review
Content:
I looked at alot of netbooks before buying this one.  The 10" netbooks were all too underpowered and did not have enough screen resolution for my needs.  I got this notebook to use for taking notes at work in lieu of my big Franklin Covey binder.  For this purpose it has been terrific.  It doesn't take alot of space on a conference room table and is fairly unobstrusive in use.  
What sold me on this one was the combination of:
- Pentium ULV processor
- Screen resolution
- Battery life
-Styling (thinner than some of the 10" notebooks that I looked at)
The machine is well made and feels very solid. The keyboard is more or less full size but definitely not as comfortable to type on as my MacBook - but its good enough and I feel fairly neutral about it.
The only thing that I don't like is the TrackPad.  The gesturing doesn't really work very well.  I'm used to using the 2 finger scrolling gesture on my Mac (which works great) but the trackpad is only a 3 out of 10 in my opinion.
Hope this helps folks.

Title: Ogg and Flac Now Supported.  Full Review Later
Content:
I just received the 250gb version two days ago and I'll post a full review tomorrow, but as one of my main disappoints with Archos has been the lack of Ogg Vorbis or Flac support, I was elated to hear that they've added it for free in the latest firmware.  I updated it last night and it plays those formats nicely.

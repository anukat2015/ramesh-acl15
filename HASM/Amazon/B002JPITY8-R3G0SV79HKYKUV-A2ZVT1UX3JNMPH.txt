Title: The best Media Player= Zune HD
Content:
Microsoft really has their act together now with the Zune HD and actually have created a Media Player device that's original in so many ways.
It is not really a iPod Touch knockoff as it delivers music and video on such a higher level that's beyond comparison.  Of course, the iPod Touch still has the edge of "stuff" outside of music and video (e.g., Apps, Browsing) but the Zune HD has obviously been designed to be the best in music and video period.  
A consumer of various iPods, the iPhone and previous Zunes, it's very impressive to list the improvements Zune HD has brought to bear:  1) UI for Music and Video, 2) Sound Quality, 3) Wireless Sync, 4) Artist Bio and Screensaver, 5) Zune Pass/Marketplace, 6) Vivid OLED Screen and, most importantly, 7) Battery Life.
In a nutshell, while the iPod Touch/iPhone conforms to the "jack of all trades, master of none" philosophy, the Zune HD focuses on being "the Master of Music and Video."  That said, there's room for the Zune HD to be the master of a few more areas as well- nice that Microsoft focused on quality first, not quantity.

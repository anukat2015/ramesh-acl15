Title: Bargain digital SLR
Content:
Fantastic photos, the color quality and automatic light adjustmnet (the camera's best features) gives superb pictures, more true to life than any other "regular" pocket digital camera.  8 megapixels actually looks better than 10 megapixels - something to do with just the right amount of detail for the human eye compared to too much "microscopic" detail.  Versatile for other types of photography too - we use it for medical documentation photos - can be adjusted like any true SLR to capture close-ups with macro lens & flash.  Compatible with medical software.  2 GB CF card more than adequate for literally hundreds of photos.  Smaller than equivalent Nikon and more compact, and personally, I think a little bit faster too between shots.

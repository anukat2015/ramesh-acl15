Title: So far so good
Content:
I've had the laptop for just under a month and everything is great. I already knew about the large battery, so that wasn't a shock. It does get quite hot, but then don't most laptops? Performance is great, boots up nice and quickly and Windows 7 seems pretty good. The only negative is that the surface and keys do pick up a lot of fingerprints that I've never noticed on any previous laptop.

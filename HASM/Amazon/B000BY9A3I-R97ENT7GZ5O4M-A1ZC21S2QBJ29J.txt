Title: Wat a Canister Vaccum! Holy cow! A W E S O M E
Content:
I bought this Canister vaccum cleaner on Nov 23rd 2008, and I have been using it on rugs & bare floors. I have been using it once every 2 weeks consistently & this thing is a monster. I owned regular Vaccum cleaners and they performed ok. This machine is the best I owned in my life. Succion is great, very mobile, easy on & off attachments, bagless design & the very light weight canister make this machine a breath of fresh air compared to any of the other vaccum cleaners i owned. It really does a Fabulous jobs , and I could not be happier!
In regards to the recommendations earlier that said anything wrong about this machine, please completely disregard. Maybe they got a lemon, maybe they cant understand the simple on & off attachments - I really cant fathom why someone would not like this vaccum canister when its got all the bells & whistles a canister can have.  At this price its a must have.
I do not usually write reviews for items i purchase, but it was only fair i do for this great product. Dirt devil - ROCK ON!!

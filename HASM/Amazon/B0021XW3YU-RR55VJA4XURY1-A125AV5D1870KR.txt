Title: Easy to use, lacks features in competitor cameras.
Content:
The staple of any Kodak camera, ease to use. This camera follows that mantra with easy to read and use buttons, and a setting dial on the top which makes switching between shooting modes simple. This type of camera, a high zoom with expanded shooting modes than a point and shoot, while still having the point and shoot philosophy so a early user to digital cameras or even a seasoned photographer can find ways to capture their pictures the best. 
What Kodak does so well also is something that sets it lower than what Sony H20, Canon SX120 IS, and Nikon L20 have in the class the Z915 is trying to enter. All of the other cameras feature better image quality, more custom modes where white balance, shutter speed, flash levels, ISO levels, and focal distance points are more expanded than what's offered in the Kodak. Also, the time between pictures on the Kodak is noticeably longer than the Sony, Canon, and Nikon. While many may not see that as a make or break when deciding on a camera, the wait time can be annoying for others. 
The Kodak does make a compelling case in the in-between segment of point and shoot, and having some settings DSLRs were exclusive to. And what the Kodak doesn't have compared to the competition, it does make up for it in the price, close to $75 to $100.

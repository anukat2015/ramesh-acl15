I DID MY RESEARCH BEFORE ORDERING AND I AM HAPPY WITH MY DEAL. THE FIRE LOGS REALLY LOOK REAL AND AD SO MUCH TO THE ROOM. THE HEAT IS OK, I AM USING THE LOW HEAT MOSTLY AND IT BRINGS THE ROOM UP 2 DEGREES SO WITH THE CENTRAL SYSTEM [THERMOSTATE] IN THE ROOM IT DOES NOT COME ON AND FOR THAT REASON THAT ROOM IS WARMER AND THE LIGHT BILL WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS USUAL. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS FROM MY WIFE, SHE SAYS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 6 INCHES WIDER AND TALLER FOR OUR FIREPLACE [NOT A BIG DEAL]. READING THE REVIEWS IS A GREAT HELP IN MAKING THE RIGHT PURCHASE AND BEING HAPPY WITH IT. DELIVERY AND PAYMENT WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED. THANKS,  SAM

Title: Best on the MARKET
Content:
Currently lived in SE Pennsylvania. Natural gas prices has rose so high, it's like paying for mortgage plus more to keep your home warm. Been using these units for 5 years. Always keep home warm. Never have to turn on the main heating system to our house. Granted there may be 1 or 2 units that are not functioning like it should, but I was never dissapointed with it's performance. About the noise, just any other working, air producing unit, "You don't want it so quiet, that you forget its on.

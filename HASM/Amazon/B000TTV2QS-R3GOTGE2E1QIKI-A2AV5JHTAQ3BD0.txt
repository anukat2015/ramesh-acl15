Title: Great heater with one flaw...
Content:
Really it's fine and dandy.  We have only one problem with it.  We use it to maintain our daughter's room since we heat the rest of our house with a wood stove.  When you turn this heater on, the default mode is just "on".  There is a thermometer... but the thermostat must be set each and every time you turn it on.  On occasion, we have made the mistake of putting our daughter down for her nap, turned the heater on, and closed the door and left her.  We return to the room hours later to find the room at 90 degrees.  
Sure, it's not entirely Lasko's fault... I don't ask that everything in our world be completely idiot proof, but really, isn't the heater the most use in a thermostat controlled mode?  Having the unit just blow full blast no matter what the temperature is a poor decision imho.  We'll probably ditch this unit to ensure that it does not happen again.  We even have a $5 heater that came with our house that will not cause us the same anxiety because it's got a basic temperature dial that can give you a ballpark limit to how hot it will get.  We turn it on... and it will heat to that same temperature every time.  Sure, it may be less accurate, but we can rest easy knowing that we won't accidentally bake our child.

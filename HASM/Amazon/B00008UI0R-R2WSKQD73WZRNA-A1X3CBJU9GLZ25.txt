Title: Would definitely purchase again - Recommended to hairy households
Content:
I have a cat and and 5 month old baby. The first leaves dander and hair everywhere and the second is about to begin crawling around in it! I had to get a new vac for this reason.  SO glad I made this choice.  Super easy to put together, nice looking, all but one attachment attach to the unit itself so storage will be awesome. This also has retracable cord storage - this could be my favorite feature!
Just vacuumed my first room and was HORRIFIED at the amount of hair and crud this vac sucked into the bagless cup. I cannot believe my old vac was leaving behind this much stuff (and it was an expensive commercial model like those used by hotels and janitorial services).  I sucked up a ton of hair (cat and long human) as well as a nickle. This vac didn't blink an eye.
The canister style will take some getting used to as I had an upright before, but the light weight of the handle is a big plus. I reduced my rating by one star only because the handle and plastic casing feel slightly flimsy. I believe this is a sacrifice for the light weight. I had a tank for a vacuum before so it could just be my personal adjustment. Most vacs I tried out at Targ3t had the same feel.
Much quiter than my old vac, but don't expect a whisper - this is a vacuum after all.
I will update this review if my opinion declines...don't expect it though!

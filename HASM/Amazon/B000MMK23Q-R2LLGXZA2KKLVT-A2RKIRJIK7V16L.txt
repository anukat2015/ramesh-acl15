Title: Edenpure is a rip off per Consumer Reports
Content:
Reported by: John Matarese 
Viewers have been asking me about a space heater advertised in newspapers and on Paul Harvey's radio show the past few weeks. 
It's the EdenPure space heater .... a heater so "advanced," it can supposedly cut your heating bill up to 50%.The cost: $400...four times the price of most heaters. 
Our partners at Consumer Reports magazine have tested it and other heaters. 
Is the EdenPure Amazing? 
The results of the test of the heavily advertised EdenPure were not promising. The $400 EdenPure ended up at the bottom of the ratings. It was the worst performing of 20 space heaters tested. 
Top Performing Heaters 
Top rated: The Honeywell Electric heater HZ-519, for just $60. (It's sold by Home Depot and Amazon.com, among other stores, but it may be in short supply, due to Consumer Reports' review. Honeywell makes some similar models wtihout the digital display that you may want to consider.) 
Also highly rated: The Holmes Quartz Tower, $60....and the DeLonghi SafeHeat Flat Panel, $80.

Title: Make sure you understand what you're getting
Content:
I am the only one in the house that drinks coffee. I normally have one cup (9 oz) every morning with breakfast. I was using a Cuisinart 4-cup coffeemaker that took about 4-5 minutes to brew the amount of coffee that filled my 9 oz mug. I was looking for something quicker and easier to use, but that did not cost more than the coffee I now use.
The Breville appeared to have what I was looking for. Even though it was primarily designed to be used with Keurig coffee modules, you can use your own coffee in the "My K-Cup" feature. The My K-Cup feature includes a plastic coffee holder with a reusable coffee filter and a measuring scoop. It is easy to use, very fast and produces an above average cup of coffee.
The problem is, unlike other coffeemakers, the Breville has an infexible, set amount of coffee for each brewing cycle. Even though you can easily choose the volume of cup you wish to fill, the strength of the coffee is accordingly varied -- the larger the cup, the weaker the cup of coffee.
In order to fill my mug at the desired strength, I had to make 2 cups of coffee: one 5 oz and one 3-1/2 oz. Between the brewing of the 2 cups, I am required to clean out the My K-Cup apparatus which is a real pain. All told, the time it takes is greater than my old coffeemaker with greater inconvenience. In view of this, the Breville brewer did not achieve the goals I had expected.

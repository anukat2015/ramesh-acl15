Title: Great player, sub-par battery life
Content:
I love this player - great improvement over my last mp3 player, Zen V Plus.  Easy to use and lots of extra features like games, wireless sync and FM radio.  Couple things I don't like about it is it isn't PnP so you HAVE to use the Zune software to access and also the battery life is fairly poor with little to no warning that it's going to die.  Overall, though, I like it a lot.  Microsoft has also put out a few software updates already which I like because it lets me know they are still working on improving what's out there instead of just forgetting about it and moving on to the next thing.

Title: Good Concept, but very awful coffee
Content:
During the past few months I have been stopping frequently at my local coffee shop for various different coffee drinks; not necessarily a fancy drink, just a good cup of coffee.  My fourteen year old daughter had lately developed a taste for coffee, also, so I decided that the good old Cuisinart coffee maker wasn't good enough!  I initially thought I would like a cappuccino/espresso maker, but after reading the reviews of the Keurig, I decided that it was the one.  I purchased the B-70 because it was the top of the line and probably was the best bet.  I also purchased the K-filter so I could use my favorite Tim Horton's ground coffee.  It looked very cool, but every cup of coffee we made, with the k cups, with the filter, flavored or none, had this awful, metal after taste.  I had read several reviews that said it tasted like brown water, however, the dark roast coffees were plenty strong enough, just that everything ended up tasting like metal.  My son said that we should give it a few days, perhaps it was just because it was new.  So, we did give it a few days, and it still tasted like metal!  So, I packed it up and returned it and am back to using my Cuisinart coffee maker!  The Keurig is a great concept and it worked great-the coffee was made in a minute and was piping hot, just not great tasting.  It's not loud at all; I don't know what some of the reviewers are talking about with that!  It looks very nice, but handsome is as handsome does and my family and I just were not pleased with the after taste.  I think now I will look for a cappuccino/espresso maker!

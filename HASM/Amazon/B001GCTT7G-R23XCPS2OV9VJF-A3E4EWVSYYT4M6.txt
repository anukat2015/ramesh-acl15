Title: Great upgrade for the average Mac user.
Content:
This MacBook is a great upgrade all things considered.  I am a longtime Mac user and have used them for everything from graphic design work to simple college papers.  I recently upgraded to this Mac from an Ibook G4.  If you are intending to use this Mac for heavy graphic design and professional video editing then it may not be for you.  I would like to refute a few of the bad reviews people have given.
1.) There is no firewire - This is apparent by simply looking at the laptop and thus if you use firewire often then don't buy it, this will save some time returning it.  Many average users do not need firewire and transferring files from an old Mac is still very easy with this new MacBook.
2.)  Some have said the screen has a bluish tint or washed out look - I have not yet run into this problem.  Make sure your display's color settings are set to LCD color and you will have deep blacks and crisp whites.  The colors in this display are clearly vibrant and the new NVIDIA graphics card ensures that your images look beautiful.
3.)  The glossy screen problem - Yes, the screen is glossy, but a simple adjustment of your viewing angle is all that needs to be done in order to lose the reflections.  This also aids in the vibrancy of blacks and whites.  Using the MacBook outside seems to give off more reflection so if you plan on using it outside you may want to purchase a matte screen film.  However, I have not had major problems with reflections.
Overall this MacBook is solid upgrade for the average Mac user.  So, you average Mac users out there, the pros of this Mac far outweigh the cons.

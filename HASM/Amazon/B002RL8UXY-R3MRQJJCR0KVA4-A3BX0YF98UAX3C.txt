Title: Sima xl-pro 480p Projector bundle review
Content:
This was a good buy for me, I bought this primarily because it said that it included a projector with a LED lamp which is exactly what I was looking for. It only goes up to 1080i but its good enough for under $500 it has to be used in a dark room but it still works good, compared to a 60in plasma for like $2000 I got this for under 500 and it is capable of going up to 100in or more, 50,000 hour lamp life, HDMI, composite, VGA and RGB connections makes it perfect for any system or player(I use a Playstation 3). Sorry but I'm not very good at writing reviews or writing in general. It didn't have the connection for cable or SDUSB even though it is on the source menu but its still a very good projector.

Title: Enough for internet access and ofimatics works
Content:
It's a basic Dual Core 2GHz processor that allows you to work comfortable with office and Internet browsers. I think it's enough for a student or a professional that generally works with text processors, spreadsheet, presentations and e-mails.
Note: If you want a better performance downgrade to win XP or some distribution of Linux (I suggest Ubuntu)

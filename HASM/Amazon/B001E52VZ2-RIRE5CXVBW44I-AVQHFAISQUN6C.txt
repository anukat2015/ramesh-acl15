Title: Not as good as it used to be
Content:
I chose the Mighty Mite because of previous experience with an older model.  
I am disappointed with the attachments--the primary reason for buying a canister.  The upholstery/dusting attachment is too small to be useful, and I miss the floor brush.  The rug/floor attachment picks up sand and grit, but not fine dust.
I also was confused about whether the vacuum had HEPA capabilities--and am sorry it does not.

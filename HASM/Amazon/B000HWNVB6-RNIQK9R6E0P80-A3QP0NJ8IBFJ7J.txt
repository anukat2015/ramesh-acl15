Title: The real deal on this camera.
Content:
I have this camera.  Only because I had a 35mm Minolta and was able to use the same lenses.  I wanted to go digital. The shutter speed on the Sony Alpha is terrible.  The range of the flash is horrible.  You will need an external flash to compare to the range of an average normal dsl camera, let along you will not have an automatic flash.  You will always have to open the flash compartment!

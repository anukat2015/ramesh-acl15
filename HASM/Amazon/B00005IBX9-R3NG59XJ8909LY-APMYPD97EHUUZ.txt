Title: Wrks for us
Content:
In the few (7+?) years since my Braun KF180 started squirting water all over my counter top, I've been searching for a replacement that would make as good a cup of Peet's Major Dikason's as the Braun did. Turns out, that was a once-in-a-lifetime purchase (not to mention Peet's changed Major Dikason's :-( ). There is no coffee maker that can make as good a cup as the Braun KF180. I have tried various Cuisinart, Melita, Krups, and DeLonghi. Some died quickly, some  a while longer, but none produced a tasty cup... I gave up and went for the 10-dollar coffee&maker Gavalia deal (mostly it's 14-dollars, but you could go to their website and find the 10-dollar deal), tossed the crummy coffee, used the maker, and suffered. Then, I finally tried this maker... and I have to say it makes the best coffee since the Braun. Really good coffee!
Not too sure about the longevity of the switches since the user must turn a dial-switch to change the auto-time, or to go from auto to manual, which we have to do almost daily... we'll see. But for now, I heartily recommend this coffee maker!!

Title: Works very well
Content:
I spent a lot of time researching which portable air conditioner to buy for my room. My room is quite large, and this baby is able to cool it down. It's relatively cheap compared to most air conditioners out there on the market. I was actually able to find this air conditioner for $249.00 from an official online Haier portable a/c distributor store =]. Shipping was $60, so in the end I bought it for around $312.00 including tax. I love this product! Warning: After buying a portable a/c, it's recommended that you leave it upright for 24 hours before operation in order to balance the cooling oil if it might have been rested on its side during transportation.

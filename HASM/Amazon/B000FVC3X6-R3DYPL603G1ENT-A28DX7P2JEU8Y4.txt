Title: Best heater and I have tried a few
Content:
We bought several heaters and tested them out over the last 3 years.  We have 2 little girls and use them to keep their rooms at 69 degrees at night (Wisconsin has some long winters).  The others we tried were complicated to set or program, but this one is easy as pie.  push the center dial, turn to the desired temp and if you want eco mode.  That's it!!!!!  It heats their 13'X12' bedrooms with ease,  I would even say it would heat rooms up to twice that size.  The first one we bought over 3 years ago and it is still going strong.
In Closing, if you are looking for a heater, look no further,  spend a little extra $$ and get this model it is worth it

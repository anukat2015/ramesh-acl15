Title: Nice looking but functionally worthless
Content:
I bought this vac a year or so ago, and have regretted it ever since.  Like most people I purchased this one in particular because I was attracted to the aesthetics.  It still looks good, but that is absolutely all it does.
The thing won't hold a charge for longer than about a minute before its sucking power reduces to a pathetically useless level.  It won't pick up objects larger than crumbs, and even that is a stretch sometimes with the heavier crumbs.  (Seriously.)  It has a vent on the side that sprays out air right in the direction of anything you're trying to vacuum, exacerbating the mess more than cleaning it up.
I spent extra money to get a vac that would look pretty when not in use, but it turns out all I got was a 60 dollar paperweight.  It is COMPLETELY USELESS as a vacuum cleaner.  I wish I had bought a cheaper, uglier vacuum cleaner - at least then it would be functional.
Do not buy.  Do not buy.  Do not buy.

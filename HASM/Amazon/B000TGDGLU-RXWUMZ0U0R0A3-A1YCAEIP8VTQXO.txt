Title: Nice heater. Works well.
Content:
This is a good heater, produces nice steady heat, and my electric bill did not go up much. My only complaint is that the power switch is hidden so I tend to unplug it each night as I am afraid of an electrical fire. It keeps the room where I use it warm, and my oil heating bill is lower because I keep it near the thermostat.

Title: Do NOT buy this heater, it is riddled with problems
Content:
I bought this heater a couple of weeks ago only to find out that they are about to do a recall and Mr. Heater advises that you don't use it. Mr. Heater customer service is horrible and they won't try to help you fix the problem, they're waiting until someone forces them to fix the problem. Mine only stays running for about 10 minutes and then goes out when using portable cylinders, as do 2 of my friends. Don't wait for Mr. Heater to help you as it will be too late, my suggestion is to return this cheap, shoddy piece of junk

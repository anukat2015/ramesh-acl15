Title: breaks
Content:
I bought one from Target and after 2 months it stopped working and didn't turn on. Returned it. Bought another b/c of the good price. Worked for 1 month and then the digital thermostat went totally screwy just like other reviews said. Odds of two in a row breaking down just like other people said....... one star is too good for a product that breaks. DON'T BUY ONE

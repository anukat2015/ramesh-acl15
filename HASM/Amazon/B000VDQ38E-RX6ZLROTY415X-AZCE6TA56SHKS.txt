Title: Don't waste your money
Content:
I would venture to guess that most of the good reviews on this product are given shortly after taking this product out of the box.  I too was impressed for the first few days....but not since.  Initially it performs very well, within a week it was hopelessly clogged with...guess what?  That's right, pet hair!!  It now clogs once a week without fail and I spend more time unclogging the darn thing than actually vacuuming with it.  I've spent as long as 3 hours working on clogs, I'm sorry but I have better things to do with my time.  
At this point it is about 3 months old, isn't clogged (that I can see), filters are clean but it only picks up using the attachments.  I give up, just looking at this unit you can see why it clogs, it is very poorly designed, the dirt has to travel around in circles for a good 5 feet before it reaches the inside container.  Do not waste your money!!

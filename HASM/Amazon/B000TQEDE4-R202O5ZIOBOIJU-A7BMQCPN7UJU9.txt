Title: Burnt plastic taste and smell
Content:
We decided to try this coffee maker to replace our just-failed (after 5 years) Krups thermal. Our first cup of coffee (after doing as instructed and running several water-only brews through  to condition the new machine) tasted and smelled like burnt plastic. The taste and smell did  not improve with subsequent brewings so we had no choice but to pack up the Cuisinart and return it to amazon.com (fortunately, that is a very easy process). I have no way of knowing if ours was just a flukey machine, but I am certainly not going to try another of this brand. Oh, and we also agree with others here who found it very difficult to get the water poured into the reservoir of this little gem.

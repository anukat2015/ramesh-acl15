Title: This Qosimo-X305-Q706 17" is a RIP-OFF!
Content:
The screen is not even 1080 HD. The 2.26 processor is slow by current standards-this would have been a good gaming machine 4 years ago, not today. 4 GB MAX is behind the times - this also hurts the speed you can attain- better ones now come 4GB with 8GB max. 
These Qosmio's are OVER priced and this is the most outdated one you will find. If your looking for a good gaming machine- Asus is light years better at a much lesser price. If you want a multi-media - go with HP HDX 18.4" - that one comes with Blu Ray, Quad processor, built in base, finger print scanner, 8 GB max, 500 GB hard drive, and you can get it for under $1700.

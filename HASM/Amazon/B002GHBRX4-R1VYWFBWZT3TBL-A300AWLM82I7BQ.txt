Content:
I have owned or used many vacuums over the years including a Kenmore,Tristar and 2 Simplicity.This vacuum is by far the best one I have ever used.Well worth the money.The 6 year warranty was defininatly a plus.The only drawback is it is a little on the heavy side,but I knew that before I bought it.

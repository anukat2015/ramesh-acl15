Title: Excellent Product!
Content:
After comparing the DCC-1200 and the DCC-1100 we decided to go with the 1100.  This is an excellent machine.  I have always used a french press but my husband wanted something with the timer function.  Neither of us wanted to substitute quality of taste and this maker fits the bill.  I have no idea what people are referring to about it being difficult to fill with water. Maybe they are just REALLY uncoordinated?  
We find it very user friendly.  The carafe pours very well with no splashing and the white and stainless looks very classy.  You can feel the quality when you compare it to other drip coffee makers.

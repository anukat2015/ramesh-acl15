Title: Pleased customer!
Content:
This is by far the best vacuum I have owned, and I've had several Hoovers, an Electrolux and most recently an Oreck.  This machine actually picks up dog hair!  It's so nice to feel like you're really cleaning the floors, not simply running over them.  I'd buy it again!

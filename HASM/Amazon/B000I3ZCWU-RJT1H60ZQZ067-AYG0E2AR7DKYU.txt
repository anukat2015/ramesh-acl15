Title: Great low light photos!
Content:
I bought this Canon because I have lenses from a Canon Rebel SLR which is a camera I still love. The lenses work great with this new digital. I do a lot of low light photograpy and the low light exposures come out very clean. 
 I am not a professional photgrapher and the manual has been very helpful in introducing all of the state of the art digital features that this camera offers. I also like the ease offered connecting the camera to my mac.

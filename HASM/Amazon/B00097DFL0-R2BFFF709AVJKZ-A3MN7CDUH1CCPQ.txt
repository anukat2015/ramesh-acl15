Title: Not bad, not great - Adequate
Content:
It works, that's the best part. But be careful when ordering - this unit does _not_ have a removable water tank. You need to use the valve at the rear. And don't tip it after it's been running or you might find water has leaked out. FYI, this model does _not_ heat. I don't know if the description has been changed, but that was not clear to me when I ordered. That's not a minus, just pointing it out. If you need heating, get the EH model.
That aside, the unit cools well and it is what it is ( a big portable unit). The remote works well (although, hilariously, it opens the tray on our dvd player too) and it was packed well.

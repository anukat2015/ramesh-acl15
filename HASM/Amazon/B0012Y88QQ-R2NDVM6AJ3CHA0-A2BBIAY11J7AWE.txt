Title: Definitely Worth The Money!!
Content:
This camera is DEFINITELY worth buying for the beginning photographer. It has everything you need to start out. It is without doubt one of the most user-friendly and reliable cameras I have ever used. If you are looking for an affordable and easy-to-use camera, then get the Canon Rebel XSi. Even if you don't know much about cameras or photography for that matter, you can still get great pictures without being a tech-expert. This is just another of the great, quality cameras that Canon has to offer. Definitely FIVE stars! =)

Title: Great for hard floors
Content:
I've had this vacuum for over a year and I still love it. It is light-weight, compact and gets the job done. I have laminate flooring and tile all throughout my house and two very large dogs. The Mighty Mite keeps up flawlessly. The Pet Paw mine came with also cleans my microfiber couches quite well. 
I only have one area rug in my home in my son's room. It is really thin and the Mighty Mite cleans it just fine. I'm not sure how it would do on thicker carpeting, but my guess is that it wouldn't be a good fit. There are no rotating bristles on the end.
We love this vacuum and are so glad that the salesman talked us out of the really expensive one!

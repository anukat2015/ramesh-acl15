Content:
I have had this MP3 player for about 4 months and couldn't be happier.It came with an AAA battery which lasts from 15 to 20 hours.The sound during my exercise periods is excellent.It is easy to download music using a USB mini cable which attaches to the MP3 and will even let you know if you made duplicate selections. The small size in no way compromises the fidelity of the music.  I would strongly recommend this MP3 player for its value, acoustics and size.

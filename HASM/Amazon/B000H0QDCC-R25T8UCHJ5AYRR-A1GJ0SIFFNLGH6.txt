Title: I always knew Microsoft was better.
Content:
So, I was deciding which MP3 player was the best for me. I bought an ipod and I have a pc. itunes never could install onto my computer. So, we had to buy a new computer. Even then, Itunes was insufficient to me. I returned it and grabbed the zune, I surely was happy.
PROS:
-So, the screens bigger than an iPod.. OWNED
-The zune software loaded perfectly onto my computer, with ease.
-Synching speed is unmatched, 1500 songs in 2 hours. 
-Lovely color, ability to make backrounds
-Radio
-When you insert a CD to synch, album art is immediately detected and thrown on your zune library (You can see the album art when you choose a song)
-Controls are a LOT better than iPod. I don't like to do that circle motion
Cons:
-Its thicker than an iPod.
OK! Zunes the way to go, I never did like Macintosh so, with all the highlights this thing has, its still a mystery why people are sucked into the iPoop.

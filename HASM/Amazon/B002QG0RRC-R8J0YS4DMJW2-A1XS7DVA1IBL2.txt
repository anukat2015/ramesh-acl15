Title: Best Coffeemaker ever !
Content:
Our Cuisinart coffee maker finally broke down after many years of good service.  Frankly it was a relief as cleaning it after each use was quite a chore. Our daughter & son-in-law have the Capresso, although the one with the swing arm, and are very pleased.  After reading many of the reviews we decided to order the Capresso TS.  We absolutely love this coffeemaker.  Preparing the coffee the night before was a breeze--make sure the bean holder is full or has enough for a pot, add water & set to brew.  We were a bit apprehensive as one of the reviewers said the grinder was "wake your wife up loud" from which we both got a chuckle. The first morning my husband did hear it grind but not since and I haven't heard it yet !  Our bedroom is about 25 feet from the kitchen & our old Cuisinart always woke us up.  We would describe that machine as "wake the entire household up"! One of the best things about the Capresso is that clean up is quick & easy--dump the grounds, rinse the filter & the pot and you're good to go.  Last but not least the Capresso makes one of the best cups of coffee out there to say nothing about how wonderful the aroma is of fresh ground coffee.  Ahhhh.  We both highly recommend the Capresso !

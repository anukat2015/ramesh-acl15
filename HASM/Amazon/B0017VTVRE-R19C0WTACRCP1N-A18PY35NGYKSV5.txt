Title: highly recommend
Content:
After long research, I chose the Miele Pisces a year ago. This is the first vacuum I can really say that I love. It's light and has great power. I have mostly bare floors and 3 - 5 long haired dogs in the house at any given time. It it doing great, except the turbo brush just doesn't work well any more despite a thorough cleaning. If you have rugs, you need something else or a power handle Miele.

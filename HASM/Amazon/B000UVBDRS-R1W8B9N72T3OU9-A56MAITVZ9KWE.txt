Title: Nice unit, provided it doesn't freeze on you all the time
Content:
Where do I begin? 
The unit looks sleek, operates well, and is smartly designed. My beef is with the software. Right off the bat when I tried to update it, the thing crashed. I had to find a site that installed the old software and then reupdate to get the thing to work. For a while it worked beautifully, provided the headset did not shock your ear so bad you pull out the earbuds in pain. Lately the unit has been freezing upon activation randomly, until just recently it completely froze. I can reset it and turn the thing back on, but no matter how many times its reset it still continues to freeze as soon as the current song pops up. What good is a unit that freezes half the time you want to use it?
I'm probably going to try and get something back for this unit and get an Ipod instead. At least those units don't freeze up all the time -_-

Title: Battery operated- very nice
Content:
SanDisk Sansa m250 Product works great. I have over 300 songs on my unit and have room for more.  My family has several other MP3 players.  What is nice about this product is that it runs on a AAA battery.  No need for charging this item. Also the battery last a good long time  The size is compact enough to fits into a pocket.  Easy to use.
If your not great at remembering to charge your MP3....this could be your dream MP3.  
I used this product on my walks (about an hour a day).  This MP3 player last just over 2 weeks on one AAA battery.  About 17 hours give or take a couple hours.  Can't complain.

Title: Great MP3 player
Content:
I bought this walkman in January after receiving a 2gb Ipod shuffle for Christmas.  I wanted something with a screen and was able to get the walkman 4gb for only about $10 more than the ipod.  The only thing I wish it had is a turn dial instead of buttons to access everything.  It is a great player for the price.

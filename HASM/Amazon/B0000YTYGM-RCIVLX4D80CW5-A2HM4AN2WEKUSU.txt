Title: We love it!  Hot coffee for hours!
Content:
My husband and I are what you might call coffee snobs.  I considered buying the Capresso but I was too cheap.  After reading all the reviews, I decided this Cuisinart may be our salvation from burned coffee sitting on the burner too long!  And it is!  I think it works great and makes a good cup of coffee (helps when you start with good beans!).  We have only had a problem with it spilling during brewing the very first time we made coffee.  Haven't had a problem since.
You do need to make sure the lid is threaded on correctly.  It's pretty obvious when it gets misaligned.  If you have to start forcing it, then it's probably on wrong.  And you have to make sure the brew basket is in correctly, but once again, that's easy to do as long as you are paying attention (although at 6:30am pre-coffee, it's hard to pay attention!).
In our experience, it keeps coffee hot for about 3-4 hours.  What's nice about it though is that even when the coffee gets to be lukewarm, it doesn't have that nasty burned taste that our old coffee maker would produce from sitting on the heating element for two hours.  The end of brewing beep is kind of loud, but it's out in the kitchen, so who cares?
Overall, we are very happy with this purchase.  We don't use the auto setting very often as we like to freshly grind our beans, but it's been easy to set up when we have done it.  Easy to clean, and I like the white with stainless steel since our kitchen is white.  The coffee maker is pretty tall so make sure it will fit under your cabinets.  I have to pull it out away from the cabinets to pour in the water, and then move it back underneath.

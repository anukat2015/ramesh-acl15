Title: GREAT COFFEEMAKER!!!!!!
Content:
This is a great coffeemaker!  It has received TOTALLY unfair reviews.  It takes some work to clean - yes, but so worth all of the effort.  From fresh coffee beans to excellent tasting coffee in one machine - perfect!  No grinder sitting on the counter with the coffee grounds that didn't quite make it into the filter section.  (I have discovered that you don't want to forget the filter because the coffee will not have a place to go and will leak onto your counter!) Great for a type A personality who likes good coffee and cleaning!

Title: Hot Little Heater
Content:
I like this heater!  Mine is quiet when it's "on", but when it cycles on-and-off you can hear a "twang".  It is VERY HOT when turned on HI, that is, when the element stays on all the time.  The thermostat works differntly than you might expect.  Insteat of regualting the voltage to the coil spring (used for the heat source), the thermostat constantly turns the coil on and off.  You can see the coil start to glow, then it turns off, then repeats.  I could hear no noise when it is turning on or off.  Also, I still felt heat even when the coil was in the brief off position, so I would say that the thermostat works.  This heater works so well that I have to have it at least 4 feet away from me, or it will fry my pants (not really, but they get hot).  I like it while I am working on my computer, I can leave my shoes off and my feet are comfortable.  Night use:  The heater, when turned on full, is bright orange.  Like the photo.  Why would someone need another night light when this thing is like a setting sun?
I disconnected the bulb by unscrewing it.  No big deal.  It would be nice if you could tilt the heater up or down; I have seen that some others do this.  Again, this is no big deal. I have had the heater one day and I like it.  I got mine at cussco (you figure it out) for $60 plus tax.
BUT - after using it for one day, I have decided I am going to return it.  The "twang" it makes when cycling on-and-off is distracting to me.  Maybe I got a bad one, I don't know.  The noise is not real loud, but I can hear it. It sounds like what you hear from a neon sign, sort of.  Oh well . . .

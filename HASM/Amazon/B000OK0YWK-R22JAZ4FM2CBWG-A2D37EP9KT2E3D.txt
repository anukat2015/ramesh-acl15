Title: nothing interesting
Content:
The Zune is basically a half-done ipod clone. It doesn't do anything particularly well and does nothing better than an ipod. The only thing to recommend it is that its tied into the microsoft "world" of services and software. If having anything not made by microsoft concerns you, go with the Zune. Otherwise don't bother.
It usually takes microsoft two generations of product and up to four years to get a product "right". Even if you think you need the Zune, I would give it a few years.

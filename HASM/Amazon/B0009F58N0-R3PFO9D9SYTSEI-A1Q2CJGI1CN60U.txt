Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I bought this unit about a week ago and I will probably send it back tomorrow. I can live with how loud it is but it simply does not cool the air! I've let it run for the past 12 hours and, while I haven't had problems with the water tray despite high humidity, it's only about 5 degrees cooler in the little room than it is outside. In other words, it does a bit better than a regular fan but costs way more to buy and, I'm sure, to power. For a 10,000 BTU rating, it doesn't do half the job of my old 5,200 BTU window unit. I've called the company twice and no one has gotten back to me yet.

Title: It's oh so quiet compared to other vacs!
Content:
I'm hooked, this vacuum really does suck! Cat hair, stray litter, people hair, dust bunnies and with no noise to leave your ears ringing and your pets terrified for their lives. I must get this turbo brush I've heard mentioned by other reviews on the web. That and lots more dust bags!
Who knew house cleaning could be fun again?!

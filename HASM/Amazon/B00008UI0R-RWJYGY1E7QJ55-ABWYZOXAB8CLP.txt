Title: Lasted less than a year before problems began
Content:
Tried this one based on a Consumer Reports recommendation.  This vacuum was heavy and cumbersome to move, and while initially great on carpets the brush soon stopped working and not fixable.  Suction came and went even after trying to fix.  A real disappointment.

Title: BULKY -- better off with an upwright
Content:
I happen to own both the upright and canister vac.  I purchased the latter item with the intent of using it for quick clean ups and for the stairs.  UGH!  This item is not only heavy, but very bulky as well.  If I could turn back time, I would not have purchased this item. Save your money and get an upright -- Dyson has stellar uprights.

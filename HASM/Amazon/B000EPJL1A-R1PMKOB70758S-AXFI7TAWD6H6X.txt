Title: I love the ipod shuffle
Content:
I received the iPod shuffle last year for Christmas. The shuffle is my first mp3 player. Up until last year, I would rely on either my portable cd walkman or my work computer to listen to my music. I consider my shuffle a blessing. It is far more convenient than a cd walkman. After having it for almost a year, my shuffle still works like a charm. There have been a few times in the past few months when I had to re-set my iPod shuffle but that quickly resolved all of the issues I had with it (like the way my music would load into it). I hate the earplugs that comes with the shuffle, they are quite uncomfortable including with those little pads it comes with (and they fall off quite easily). Warning: if you try to use another iTunes library, the music in your shuffle will be deleted. Another minor flaw with the shuffle is that it is very easy to hit the wrong buttons but overall I still love the shuffle.

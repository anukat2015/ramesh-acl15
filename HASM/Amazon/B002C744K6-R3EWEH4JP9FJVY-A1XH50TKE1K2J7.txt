Title: Excellent laptop...
Content:
Yeah, you are paying a little more but you are paying more for quality parts.  This laptop not only works well as family machine but when I need the robustness of a desktop for video and photography, I know I can trust it with this laptop.  You will not only enjoy the keyboard and light weight of the laptop but as well as the excellent design of the Operating System.  I have used Mac products now since 2002.  They just last.  My mother is still using my PowerBook G4 I pick up in 2002.  The only thing that wore out was the hinges.  No problem fixing.  You will enjoy using this laptop.

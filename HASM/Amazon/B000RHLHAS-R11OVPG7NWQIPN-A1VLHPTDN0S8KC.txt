Title: Thermostat is completely inaccurate
Content:
I have purchased many space heaters in the past since our house is so old, and this has been the worst.  The air smells horrible, and the thermostat is never correct.  I will set it for 70 degrees, and it will keep heating at random times up to 80 degrees.  This is not ideal considering it was in an infant's bedroom.  Personally, I say stick to the Lasko brand.  We've had two of their heaters forever, and I made the mistake of buying a bit cheaper.  Now I will end up spending even more to replace this horrible product.  Don't waste your money!

Title: Never looked back!
Content:
We had a kitchenaid pro coffee maker.  Drip coffee makers is the best way to make coffee.  The maker that we had took a long time to choose.  We have replaced that coffee maker with the Breville.  If you are thinking about it, don't, just buy it.  We absolutely love this machine.  We use it to make coffee, tea, and hot cocca.  It makes a great cup of coffee.  
We have compaired it against a standard Keurig machine. This machine just tastes better when compaired with the same coffie and water.  The filters are a bit more expensive along with the machine, but it is a well made machine.  We have used it for a few months now and have no issues with the machine.  Like most other Breville equipment, the machine is very solid.  You won't be disappointed by the machine.

Title: Better than Ipod
Content:
I LOVE my Zen Vision:M!  It is so much better than ipod and much easier to use.  With Ipod, you can only put music on it from your own computer, but with the Zen, you can take music from a friend's computer, some from a computer at work, as many different computers as you want.  It also has a FM radio and Ipod doesn't.  I have pictures, movies, whole seasons of my favorite tv shows, and all the music I could want, and I still have room for more.  All my friends who have Ipods are jealous.  This thing is awesome and you can't go wrong if you buy one.

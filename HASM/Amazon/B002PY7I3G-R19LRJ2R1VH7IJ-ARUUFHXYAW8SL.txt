Title: For the money, a great laptop
Content:
This Gateway laptop, after much searching, seemed one of the best values for the money out there. I went with the name [I have always been more than satisfied with my Gateway desktops - first one purchased in 1994 - currently using a model purchased in 2005 that still runs like a top!], and was not disappointed. The Gateway NV5425U looks sharp, is solidly built, and has the performance features that I need. All running very smoothly!! With my Amazon Prime shipping, I got a wonderful laptop, and added a wireless mouse & pad, and a carrying bag all for UNDER $600.  Not a bad deal. Love the PC!

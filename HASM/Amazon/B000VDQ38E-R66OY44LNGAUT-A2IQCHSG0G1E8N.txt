Title: Picking up hair is the only thing it does well.
Content:
I purchased this vacuum after reading all the positive reviews about it, and I must say that I have been extremely disappointed. Though, I must say, the vacuum picks up pet hair like none other. If that's the only issue you have, and have no need for a regular vacuum cleaner to clean the rest of the messes around the house, than this is the one for you. I, however, do not have the luxury of having multiple vacuums for multiple jobs. This vacuum does not fit under anything, it's very heavy, the dust cup makes a huge mess with every empty, it doesn't clean close to the edges of the wall, and it doesn't work well on bare floors as the brush does not turn off, making it a risk to damaging nice wooden floors. 
The worst issue I have has to do with the brush not turning off. While using the attachments, the brush continues to run, even when it's in the "upright, locked, position" the customer service department told me to do, it rips our carpet to shreds. There is a deep brush mark and a pie of carpet shreds underneath it after each time. Not cool. Their customer service is difficult to get to, and less than understanding. I DON NOT recommend this vacuum!

Title: My First DSLR
Content:
I bought this camera a few months ago to replace a camera that ended up getting destroyed and have had nothing but great fun shooting everything i can see.  I am currently deployed to Afghanistan so i have an opportunity to shot so many things here that i could even imagine getting back home.  the quick feature does just what it says it does.  this camera not only has the ease of use of a point and shoot camera but i think is great for someone who is learning the field of photography.  for those of you who can't figure it out on your own, do what i did, hit the bookstore, or amazon online like i did, and there are tons of books out there to help you on your way to becoming a great photographer and how to get the tack sharp photo that the pros always get. 
This camera doesn't take video so if you are looking for that in a digital camera you are looking into the wrong one.  
Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone that asks me about cameras.

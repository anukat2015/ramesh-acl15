Title: From the perspective of someone in a wheelchair
Content:
So, this review will be somewhat unique. It is, specificly, from the perspective of someone in a wheelchair. That right. I am in a wheelchair. I have Cerebral Palsy and limited dexterity within my fingers. 
I finally took the plunge and bought an MP3 player. After reading extensive customer reviews, I decided to get this player over any other player. I am really glad I decided to do that! 
The buttons on this device are big and easy to use. I love how I barely have to touch the center "dial" to make something work. Also, the entire botton half seems to act as a button. The menu test is not to small to read and I can see everything clearing from a distance. (For example, with the unit sitting flat on the table.) The power button and "lock" feature also works well. This is definately a 5-star device!!! 
If I had to find something "bad" about the unit it would be the following. The ear-buds that come with the unit are imposible for me to insert in my ear. I had to order some other "over-the-head" headphones and they seem to work great.

Title: Never buy a Gateway!
Content:
I got a Gateway, had it for a month and then had problems.  So, then I had to wait for Gateway to send me a box, so I could send it into them to get it fixed.  After a month, still no box... so I had to call again (and I do believe that when you call, you're calling India, because I couldn't understand half of what the guy was saying and I don't think he understood me, either).  Finally the box came, so I sent it in.  I got my computer back about a month later and their carrier service left the computer laying flat on the ground (rather than tipped on its side) between our wooden door and screen door and the screen door blew off the front of the house, taking the door frame with it!  But anyway, I started my computer and it worked for a while.  But then, right before the one year warranty was up, I had to take it to Best Buy, because everything was going wrong with it (again)!  Best Buy told me it needed a new hard drive and it probably needed one for a long time (like that's what should've been fixed when I sent it to Gateway).  I got it replaced.  Took it home... it had no sound, no video, etc.  I had to wait for Gateway to send me a disc for that.  Long story short: NEVER buy a Gateway.  Bad computers, poor customer service.  I am now officially a Mac user because of the experience.

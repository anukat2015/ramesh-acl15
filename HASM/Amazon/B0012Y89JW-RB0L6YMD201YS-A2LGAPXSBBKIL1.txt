Title: Great Camera
Content:
The last camera I bought was almost 11 years ago. It was a Nikon CoolPix. Great camera but it is antiquated now. I researches for a new camera for at least 10 months before I finally decided upon this one. I wanted a Nikon but all of the reviews lead me to this camera. Feature for feature, dollar for dollar this camera could not be beat. I am satified with it. I do not have any complaints. I made a good choice. This camera will not disappoint you!

Title: Smokin'
Content:
I have mainly purchased dozens of Dell laptops, wary of any other brand due to warranty issues. I took a chance with HP and I am very impressed with the quality of the display, sound, and durability. I was hoping that the video card would handle GTA4 but it does not, but that's ok, all other programs run smoothly. The touchpad is smooth so it takes a bit of getting used to in order to navigate. Because of the gloss finish, it does collect fingerprints easily, so keep a cloth handy. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this laptop to any type of user.

Title: replaced my desktop
Content:
I purchased this computer, since my daughter takes up the desktop most of the time.  I find the keyboard easy to use, and appreciate the number keys to the right.  It has never frozen up on me, and with wifi, I have a great surfing experience.  this computer is sturdy, the screen is bright, and I have no trouble with vista, despite the negative hype.  The only downside to this computer is the size, if you travel alot and need to bring a laptop, I would probably recommend a smaller model.  Also the battery life is fairly short, another travel problem. Other than that, I recommend this affordable, reliable computer.

Title: Great / Long Burning Furnace
Content:
I use one in my wood shop and it really works well.  In fact I am here to get another.  Heats a mostly uninsulated standard two car garage from 30 to 65 degrees in about 30 minutes.  A standard 20lb propane cylinder will keep this guy going for about 30 hours.  In summary, I would recommened this product.I also have a small Patton fan that I cautiously use to blow air across the back of this unit.  The fan circulates and distributes the heat.  If you live in the north, you might want to get the double or triple unit.

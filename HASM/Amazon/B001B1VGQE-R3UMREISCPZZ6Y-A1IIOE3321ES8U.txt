Title: Piece of junk
Content:
I had high hopes for this unit. The theory behind it seems good, touting minimal wasted heat, compact size, yadda yadda yadda.
My first unit lasted about a month and half, after which is would shut itself off for no good reason. I sent it back, and with the long delays in response by the manufacturer, the replacement unit arrived in the Springtime. Oh well, at least I'd be in a good position next Autumn.
When the cold weather set in, I started using it, and guess what? Same thing happened. I'm tempted to just send it back to them, in hopes they can use the raw materials to make something that really works.
Save your money and buy some blankets. This thing is a waste of time.

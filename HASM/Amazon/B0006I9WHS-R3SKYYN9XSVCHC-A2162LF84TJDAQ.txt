Title: Great Heater for Office or Bath Room!
Content:
I love this heater. I use it all the time at work and it keeps me warm and toasty. I love that it has a dial so that if you get too hot you can turn it down. It heats up super quick and turns itself on and off to keep the right temperature. Its nice and small and has a nice look to it too.  I like it so much that I'm buying another one to keep my bathroom warm for when I take showers.  Oh, and for the people that say there is no on/off switch, you just turn the dial all the way down to turn it off. The light stays on, but the heater will not come on if you have the dial all the way down. Trust me, I have it plugged in at work all the time.

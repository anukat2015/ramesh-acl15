Title: HP Pavilion of poor quality
Content:
I bought an earlier model of HP pavilion (dv7-1130). After 15 months it started crashing. After much time lost, including all data/programs, I had to pay 350$ to fix it. Prior to that I had a Toshiba that has served me faithfully for 6 years. No more HP products for me.

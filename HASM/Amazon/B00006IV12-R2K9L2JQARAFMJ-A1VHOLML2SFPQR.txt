Title: tested the rest settled on the best
Content:
i was sick of being cold and tired of paying a huge electric bill when i'd turn on our floorboard heaters so i decided to try a bunch of different heaters.  first was an oil based space heater, i couldnt even tell it was on.  then i got the 360 heater by honeywell.  that one i turned off immediately because it was super noisy.  then this one i turned on and instantly felt the heat.  it is very quiet, puts out more heat than a space heater and very inexpensive.  i highly recommend it.

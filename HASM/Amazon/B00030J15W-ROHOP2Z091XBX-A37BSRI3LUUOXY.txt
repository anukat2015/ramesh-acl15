Title: Bitter tasting
Content:
Initially I really liked this coffee maker. It has all the features to make lattes, etc. and is easy to use. However after a couple of weeks I decided to return it. It does something to the taste of the coffee. I tried making it exactly right, tried changing coffees but it still have a funny bitter taste which I can only assume is from the type of materials used, or the way it creates the coffee. Also had a problem getting hot enough coffee. So not recommended unless you don't care how the coffee tastes (like my husband). 
However, I have a WestBend kettle which is fantastic so this is not a review against the brand which has does have good products.

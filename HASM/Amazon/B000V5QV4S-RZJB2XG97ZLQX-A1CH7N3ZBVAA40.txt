Title: Good upgrade of the midrange Canon Line
Content:
Have used Canon products since the 1980's before the EOS line even came out and have shot digitally since I bought a 10D when it first came out 4-5 years ago. It was a great camera and still lives in my bag, but the 40D is a huge improvement in many ways. Autofocus is much faster and startup time is as well. File sizes are much larger, particularly when you shoot raw, which you really should as they are 14 bit files. Adobe can open the raw files, but only the latest version. I use Adobe Lightroom to process photos and it works beautifully. You can adjust for exposure in postprocess and you'll be amazed at the capacity in these 14bit files.

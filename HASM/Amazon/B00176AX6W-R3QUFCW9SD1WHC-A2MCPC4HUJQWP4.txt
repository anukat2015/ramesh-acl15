Title: Beautiful screen. But the magic ends there. Just AWFUL!
Content:
I've never owned an ipod so when it came time to buy a cool video/music player I was seduced by the big screen coupled with the large hard drive. (Apple offers one or the other, but not both in a single device). I spent a long, miserable day trying to make this thing work for me. By 10PM I had listed it on Ebay and ordered an ipod. Expensive lesson. 
For starters the software and hardware synch is classic Microsoft. Clunky, counterintuitive, never quite does what you want it to. I'm a technical guy and when I found myself frustrated I started imagining how a regular consumer must feel. It's that bad. 
The worst part was the online store. The video selections are pathetically few. NO MOVIES!! I even tried downloading something from Amazon Unboxed, but the amazon software wouldn't recognize the zune and I was never able to pull any content onto the device. So...what you have is a beautiful screen on a run-of-the-mill (at best) mp3 player. 
My new ipod arrived yesterday. The screen is a little smaller (but the hard drive is actually bigger--120Gb). It was wonderfully simple to set up. The itunes store has an unbelievable array of content. I hated the idea of being a Apple lemming, but they got it right. And Microsoft got it the way Microsoft always does...complicated and disappointing. 
Advantage Apple.

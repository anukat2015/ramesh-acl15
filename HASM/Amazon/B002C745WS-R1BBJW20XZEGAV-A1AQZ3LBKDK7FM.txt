Title: MacBook Pro is the way to go!
Content:
After owning 4 laptop PCs over the years and ALL of them crashing on me due to nasty viruses, I decided to make the leap. What can I say that hasn't already been said before...soooo easy to use, sooo easy to install programs, sooo sexy, sooo fast! I could go on and on. Graphics and integration with Adobe products and my iPhone apps are much smoother.
Service, service, and more service. Apple is there to give you TLC, no matter what your issues are.
Love it!

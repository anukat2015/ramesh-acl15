Title: Best Vacuum I've Ever Owned!
Content:
I thought the vacuum I previous used did a pretty good job for my household of 2 cats and a dog. However, I recently adopted another dog which sheds horribly. In spite of more frequent vacuuming, there was always hair everywhere. After doing some Internet research, I decided to try the Bissell 3920 Pet Hair Eraser. With some reservations, I might add, because I'm skeptical about product advertising. 
With my first use of this cleaner, I couldn't believe the results. After doing only one room, the dirt cannister overflowed with dog hair. Looking at the carpet before I vacuumed, it wasn't apparent that all that hair had been in it. Even the color of the carpet showed a subtle change, almost looking like it had been shampooed. Yes, it's a pain in the behind to stop so frequently to empty the cannister but I will gladly do that to have a much cleaner house. I heartily recommend the Bissell Pet Eraser.

Title: Touchscreen is great; beware of noisy fan
Content:
If you are a fan of touchscreen devices, this computer fits the bill.  The touchscreen is responsive, easy to use, and makes computing that much enjoyable.  Because the screen is small, however, you will sometimes need to use the mouse pad in order to be efficient.  So the end result is a combo touch / mouse functionality.  I found that reaching up to use the touchscreen is sometimes tiresome, simply because you have to raise your whole arm up to do so, rather than being able to rest your hands on a surface.  But I wouldn't go back ever again to a traditional laptop.
Having said that, beware of the noisy fan.  It is constant, loud, and a real annoyance.  It is hard to picture how such a small laptop will have such a noisy fan.  But it does - It is even louder than an old beater desktop.  Louder than a refridgerator.  I kid you not.  It is louder than the big Apple G4s that were dubbed "wind turbine".  It really sounds like a jet airplane.  Again, I kid you not.  You will not be able to use this computer in a quiet environment.  
I've had this computer for 6 months now, and love the touchscreen features; but the fan noise, plus the incredible heat the computer gives off makes me want to throw it against a wall sometimes.  The computer gets so hot it will burn you if you have it anywhere near your body.  It even burns through jeans.  
So for the touchscreen features, I give it a 5 out of 5.  But because of the fan noise and the heat, I give it a big fat zero.  So if you average this out, I would give this computer a 2.5 out of 5.

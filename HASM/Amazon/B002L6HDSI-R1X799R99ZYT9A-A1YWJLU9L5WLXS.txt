Title: Works great, no where near enough storage space
Content:
As this is my first iPod, I thought a 2000 song capacity would be more than adequate. After loading 500 songs and only having 2gb of space left I knew I was in trouble. Turns out the 2000 song capacity is based on 4 minute songs. I'm a huge Gov't Mule fan...that may not mean anything to you, but they can't even get a warm up done in 4 minutes. I now have a 120gb iPod classic. Much better. Other than that, the Nano was great...but I really miss the orange color.

Title: Nice cup of coffee
Content:
This makes a nice cup of coffee.  After following the instructions on cleaning before the first use, I made a pot of 6 cups.  The coffee was delicious, just the way I like it.  It had nice body, was hot, and did not have any bitter burn taste.  This costs a couple bucks more, but its well worth it.
My only gripe is that the lid isn't hinged.  I'll get over it.

Title: Good product good value
Content:
I received my order and hooked it up last night in less than an hour (mostly because I had a buzz and hooked all the wires up the first time backwards, my fault completely) and I can say without a doubt anyone should be able to hook this thing up. The only way I could see it being difficult is if you unhook the old thermostat without looking at the hookups first and even then my wires were the same color as the posts they matched so that should not create problems. I am pleased with both the thermostat and the fact I paid $50 less than I was going to for another brand. As for the clicking noise another review mentioned, I don't recall ever haveing a thermostat that didn't make some sort of noise when it switches on and I guess if you were standing next to it and no one was talking or making much noise it would grab everyones attention  but come on I have had TV's make more noise when you turn them on. Great value.

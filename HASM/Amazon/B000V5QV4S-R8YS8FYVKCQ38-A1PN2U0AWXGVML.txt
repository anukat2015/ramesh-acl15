Title: Excellent all around
Content:
Picked this up last monthwith the lens. After using the camera with the kit lens I'm convinced the lens is very good. The lens sells for about $400 but with camera, it only adds $200. I also bought the Sigma 10-20mm lens from Amazon and this lens is great for ultra-wide angle photos. It really completes the set of lens I'll need.
Now, for the camera, I think its fantastic. Its got a solid magnesium alloy body and looks and feels more expensive than it is. It's got all the features you would want including Live View which can come in handy at certain times. The 10.1 megapixels is an improvement over the Digital Rebel at 6.3 megapixals. The camera is very fast at 6.5fps compared to the rebel's 2.5fps. The rebel can only take 4 pictures until the memory catches up but the 40D can take up to 75! That is really good.
Another thing I love is that the camera displays the iso in the viewfinder and the LCD info screen. That is very handy compared to the Rebel. The 40D is the first prosumer SLR to have a 3" screen. The screen does not have as many pixels as the Nikon's new D300 but that camera cost's about $500 more.
Are the pictures that much better than the Rebel? Not really. The Rebel takes phenomanal photos but you just won't be able to enlarge as much. You won't have the control on the Rebel as you will the 40D.
Is it worth upgrading? I say yes because I have had the Rebel for almost 4 years now and this new 40D will probably be the last SLR I'll have to buy (unless it breaks). 10.1 megapixels is way plenty and more would be redundent so hopefully this is the last camera I have to buy.
Hope this review helps you decide.

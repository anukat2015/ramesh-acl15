Title: JUST what I needed
Content:
The Presto Heat Dish was EXACTLY what I wanted. It was humorously situated in a display in a local warehouse where amazed patrons walking laterally in the path 15' away would turn to see where the sudden heat was coming from! They sell out of this every year! I sit at my computer in the living room which is an open 25'x25' and there's no WAY any other space heater would be effective EXCEPT if i light a fire in the fire place. And that's the best comparison for this unit's radiant heat. I stay toasty warm and yet not too warm because I've turned down the main thermostat. It's perfect. And it's amazing! No, it's probably not for a bedroom while sleeping, but ... Further points: It is TOTALLY SILENT. not like the now-old Quarts Tube heaters that  jar you awake at any setting other than High. It has an infinitely variable heat adjustment that works well ... It will cycle on and off, but the glow wires don't cool off as fast and can maintain the desired amount. It looks cool when it's on high and glowing orange, but you do not need it on "high orange" to feel heat. 
If you get this, you won't be dissapointed. It's fun. I'm not convinced the price posted here is the best price. ;)

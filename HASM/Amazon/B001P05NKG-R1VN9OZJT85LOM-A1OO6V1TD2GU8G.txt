Title: 4,7 lbs. of Perfection
Content:
This MacBook pro was bought to replace a 15 inch Dell laptop.  The Dell was too large to use comfortably on a plane during business travels and was too heavy to lug with any degree of comfort.
I chose the MacBook Pro model with the 2.53 ghz processor, 250 GB drive and 4 GB ram.  I installed Microsoft Office 2008 and bought an adapter for the video out to VGA so I could hook it up for Powerpoint Presentations..
As a first time Mac user I  had lots of trepidation in switching, but was fed up with virus, malware and UI unfriendliness.  Much to my surprise, the MacBook was intuitive, and while the filing system took me a while to catch on to, it was a very easy transition.  All my MS 2007 documents from the PC moved over and opened without a hitch.
The dock annoyed me until I realized it could disappear until I needed to use it, and that programs I didn't want shortcuts do could me removed from the dock with a drag,
When they say 7 hour battery life it is a stretch.  You have to dim down everything but I always get a solid 6 hours without any compromise.  I'll add the Magnetic power adapter is pure genius.  It has save clumsy me many times, especially during client presentations without any embarrassment.
I've had many PC laptops.  All have been...well ... constructed with lots of doors, external screws and plastic parts.  The MacBook's solid aluminum body and thin, light design is wonderful.   The backlit keyboard is great for working in dim situations, like on a plane.
The only thing I which was included was the VGA adapter, but at $29, I'm not too mad.
This is well worth the money and II would recommend it to anyone!

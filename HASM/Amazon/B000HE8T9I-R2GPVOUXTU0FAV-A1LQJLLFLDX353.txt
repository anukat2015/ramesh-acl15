Title: Heavy but powerful
Content:
I can only compare this to the one other vacuum I have owned, and there are pros and cons about this one. First, pros: 
-It's very powerful. It picks up large pieces of things with ease, like cat food. I used to have to physically place my old vacuum atop any large item I wanted it to pick up so it could be directly suctioned up or it would just push it around the floor. 
-I like the rubber bumper along the front; it makes me feel less terrible when I scrape or knock it against a wall accidentally. 
-The handle lowers all the way to the ground in one fluid motion. 
-The attachments are easy to use and helpful; I especially like the upholstery tool. It takes a few sweeps, but it got up all the cat hair on my couch cushions. 
-The dirt container is really big so it doesn't need to be emptied as much. 
-The light is really bright and helpful when cleaning a dark area. 
-It comes with extra filter and belts. Extra filters can be used when cleaning the ones already in the machine, since they need to dry completely before being used again. Makes it so you can use the vacuum even if you need to clean your filter. 
Now the negatives:
-It's really loud. Especially if you're cleaning carpet and have the brush on.
-It's really heavy. Much heavier than my old vacuum. (Although it does have a better handle for lifting up stairs, sorta compensates)
-The dirt canister can be a mess, as others have said. Do not empty atop full garbage can! The button you push to release the dirt doesn't really open the canister, you still have to use your hands and get dirty. Empty into an empty garbage can, and lower all the way in when you open it. That works pretty well for me. 
-The cord storage area is very cramped and I bang my hand a lot when I try to roll the cord back up. It takes forever because I have to be careful not to scrape the skin off my knuckles. There's just not much room and it's over an attachment. 
Overall, I like this vacuum compared to my old one. It's a little loud and heavier, but it's got great power. Just make sure you read all the instructions and make sure all parts are locked firmly into place when using.

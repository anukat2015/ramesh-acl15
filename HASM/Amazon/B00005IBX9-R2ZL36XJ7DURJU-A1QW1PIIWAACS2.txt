Title: Worth the price
Content:
We purchased this coffee maker after going through several, less expensive, Mr. Coffee-style machines.  With cheaper machines, my husband had always complained about a 'plasticky' taste in the coffee. He was astounded to find that this machine does not produce that taste as we had tried using bottled water, other brands of coffee and 2-3 different machines trying to solve the problem.  I love the design refinements like the included metal mesh filter cone. I also love that the filter assembly can be removed and emptied without dripping or trailing grounds all over (!). We love the assortment of gentle beeps that let you know when the coffee is ready, or that the burner is turning off. This item also looks great in our retro kitchen.  My only quibble is that the place where you fill the water reservior is a bit small, so if you're working in a tight space, you either need to move the machine around or accept some dribbles.  I was very skeptical about paying this much for a coffeemaker when cheap ones are available for $20.  I am now utterly convinced that it was money well spent. The quality definitely shows.
Edit: Unit has no problems with condensation as mentioned in earlier reviews. The problem must have been addressed. As for temperature, I would call the coffee 'piping hot'.

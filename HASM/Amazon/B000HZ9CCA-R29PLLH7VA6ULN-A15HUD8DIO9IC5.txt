Title: Poor battery life - Just like many other reviews
Content:
I have had the Sansa View 16 gb now for about 1.5 weeks. I read closely the reviews on poor battery life, but bought the unit anyway.
+ I like the interface
+ Very nice sound and video quality
+ Wanted a unit with radio (unlike Ipods) because for my use, that would be perhaps at least 3/4 of its usage.
+ Radio reception actually quite good. I am in a urban area and many radio channels butt right up agaist each other. Tuner works great to seperate them with no bleed over and minimal static
- Battery life, as with about 1/3 of the review reports listed here for the unit, battery life for me is no where near the claimed spec. I have put it into every power saving setting possible. I once got 10 hours run time out of it, but usually only about 7 hours max. That is with the preloaded music running in repeat mode, no memory card installed. Using the radio seems to cut run time down to about 4 hours. These are all continuous run times. This is a far cry from the spec of 'up to 31 hours'. I'd say an outright lie. Sansa support non-existant. Try contacting them v-mail, e-mail, web... basically you are on your own once the product is in your hands.
For me, I am returning the unit. I am miffed by why so many reviewers report a mixed bag on the battery life. Perhaps a diff unit will prove better. I will update the post if another unit works well.
I have not tried loading any MP3's or anything for that matter, so can't comment on that apsect. Just tying to work through the battery life issue before I bother using the unit at any deeper level.

Title: Rating it before I even received it.....
Content:
Well, this is unusual, but I am writing a review before I even receive it (it's on the way). But I have used a Miele before (a different model, owned by someone else), and I can tell you that this company creates the best vacuum cleaners I have ever experienced. 
Let me tell you first off that I HATE HATE HATE to vacuum. I only do it if I am having company. Maybe. I hate the sound of them. My pets are afraid of them. I find most of them bulky and tiring to lug around. 
But a Miele is another thing altogether. I have read all the other reviews here, and cannot agree more. They are light, quiet, efficient, easy to move around, easy to change the bag, very clean, and so on.
I am going to start vacuuming more once I have it, because it is so much easier.
I would wager that any Miele vacuum is well worth the price if you can afford it -- just make sure you get the model that is right for what you want to do with it, as there are so many choices.
Five stars!

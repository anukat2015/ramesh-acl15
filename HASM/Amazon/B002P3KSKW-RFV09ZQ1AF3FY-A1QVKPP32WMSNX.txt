Title: Love it
Content:
I spent a  lot of time looking for the perfect balance between power and portability. The net books don't do it for me. I was looking at the Toshiba Satelite T135 (3.8 lbs with no dvd) and the ASUS UL30A (3.7 lbs with no dvd)as well as the comparable Sony, Fujitsu and others. After much back and forth I found this little gem which is only .3 pounds more has a dvd in it and is just right for me and the user reviews are decidedly more positive than the other laptops. 
I have used it for 2 weeks now and love it. The shinny keys work just fine for me no slipping at all and the touch pad is as good as any I have ever used.
 It's thin, light weight, a real computer and sexy. 
UPDATE: 3/1/10 After two plus months I still love the laptop. The only problems I have is I am always hitting the CAP lock key, which is annoying, and my laptop just died last week with no warnings and is now at the ACER repair facility. The online return to repair procedure was was easy to follow and do. 5stars on tech support, but 1 star for a dead machine in month three. More to follow.....

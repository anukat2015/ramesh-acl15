Title: Returned it for the Olympus E-520
Content:
Bought the XSI from Amazon, with great expectations.  Glowing 
Reviews.  The Camera feels cheap.  Very loud shutter operation.
Awkward hand position.  Live View is a Joke.  If you have a 
significant other that will want to use it like a point and shoot
through the LCD. Good Luck.  NO AUTO FOCUS using shutter.  
4 step process to take a picture.  Camera just didn't 
"Feel Right".  Olympus on the other hand feels stout, your hand 
and fingers naturally fall where they should. Live View works 
just like it should, albeit a little slow.  All this for almost 
$150.00 cheaper.

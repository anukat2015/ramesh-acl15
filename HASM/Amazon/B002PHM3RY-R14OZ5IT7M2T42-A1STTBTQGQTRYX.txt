Title: Fantastic Machine
Content:
This machine demolished the competition. I was in market for a netbook, and purchased a dell originally. received 2gb or Ram and an atom processor and Windows Vista :-( because you cannot have Windows 7 on a netbook with more then 1Gb of Ram. paid 600 dollars. I returned the dell immediately upon the discovery of this machine. Not only is it cheaper but outperforms any Netbook on the market. The second core is excellent for watching movies, and regular tasks. Extremely happy with it.

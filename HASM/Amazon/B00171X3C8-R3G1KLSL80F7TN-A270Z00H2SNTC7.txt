Title: Good feature set, each feature is below average.
Content:
Fm Radio, SD micro expansion, Flash based GUI. Poor reception across multiple head/earphones, SD information is not incorporated with built-in memory, processor is slow. Startup time is over 10 seconds. For those buying a player for the first time, most of these concerns will not be apparent, however given the better reviews one can find of similarly priced products I can not recommend this.
I enjoy the player's ability to be used for media while charging which many non-ipod mp3's lack. It has a likable lightweight feel, but this is hindered by the D-pad which controls the system. It is less responsive than it should be which is instantaneously frustrating. And more on the design, the head/earphone jack does not fully insert itself into the receiving port (by a millimeter or so). iriver is not a bottom-rung company, but knowing this leads a user to believe they did not purchase an iriver product.

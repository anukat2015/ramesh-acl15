Title: An ok Heater
Content:
Rec'd this little heater and it was not packaged properly. In any event, I decided to keep it and have been using it nightly for the past few days.  It is really small and can/should be used in an equally small room.  It warms up my daughter's room enough so I do not worry about the slight draft that gets through. I gave the four stars because of the crappy packaging.  This looks like a returned or reburbished product, only time will tell.

Title: Great player overall, bringing up a few negative points
Content:
I think just about everything that needs to be said about the Zune has already been said in other reviews, so I just wanted to bring up a few points.
*The ear phones that come with the Zune are not very durable and the sound quality could be better so plan to buy new ones.  The cord on mine broke (to expose part of the wires) after maybe 2 months.
*The navigation wheel does not seem to work unless you use a bare finger tip on it.  This is great while the player is in your pocket as it doesn't skip to other songs, but a real pain when it is extremely cold outside and and you don't want to take off your glove!  
*Sometimes the navigation wheel seems to go much faster or slower than I'd like.  
*Battery life could be better.  Just having the screen on a lot drains a lot of battery, but this is probably a given.  It's not really an issue if you are able to charge the player every night.  
*If you want to shuffle songs there is no display to tell you what song # you are on.  (i.e. 12/2891)
Overall, the Zune is the best MP3 player I have ever had and I love using it.  The screen is gorgeous and it plays music very well.  I also had an issue (or thought I had an issue) with my player and contacted Microsoft for assistance and they were very prompt and helpful in answering me.  Great customer service is not always easy to find!

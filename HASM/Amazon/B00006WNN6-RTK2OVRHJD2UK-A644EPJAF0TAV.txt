Title: Quiet, But Not Too Powerful
Content:
The title says it all: It is so quiet that you can barely realize it's working. However, it will take a long time to make your room warm.
There are much more powerful heaters on the market. But I love the silence. And, the "not-too-hot" property just fits my needs.
Recommended if you're not living in a cold neighborhood.

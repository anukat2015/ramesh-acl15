Title: FIRE HAZARD!!!
Content:
I have this coffee pot and it STARTED ON FIRE in my home this morning!!  Luckily, I was in the same room and noticed the smoke and smell.  When we saw the flames, we threw it out into the snow.  Thank goodness the fire did not spread and we are all safe.  It was a normal cycle...just finished brewing a pot of coffe.  The coffeemaker was only about a month old.  
Yikes!!!
I have reported it to DeLonghi and am expecting to hear back from one of their representatives.  
I would stay away from this model!!

Title: Great computer
Content:
I'm a college student and this is the perfect computer for me.  Reviews on this site are very accurate, and I got exactly what I was expecting to get.
Pros: Lightweight, good keyboard, battery life (appx 10 hours), function hotkeys, video output and SD slot, charges quickly, performs multiple tasks with no problem, windows 7 nice to use.
Cons: Aesthetics only.  Does show fingerprints and dust excessively.  Textured track pad not as nice as the glass pads on Macs,and multitouch only works for scrolling, not flipping back and forth between pages.
Overall, the pros greatly outweight the cons.

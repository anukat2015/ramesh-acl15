Title: Great overall laptop
Content:
This is a great laptop for the money and I would buy it again.
Pro's: 
Light compared to some other laptops (LED vs. LCD screens usually)
Screen is very bright and easy to read
HDMI allows output to HDTV (also for using Media Center on the HDTV)
4GB RAM
Good battery life (it was running for 3.5+ hours the other day)
10-Key number pad
5-1 card reader (for plopping in an SD card from a digital camera/camcorder)
Con's:
Fingerprints are highly visible on laptop cover -- glossy black
Keyboard layout is cramped with certain keys (arrow keys, delete key)
Speakers do not sound as good as my 3 year old Toshiba laptop
No physical button for volume control -- it's software controlled via keyboard/Windows.
Addt'l comments:
I also have a Lenovo T61p and the HP is lighter, has better battery life, and a softer keyboard (which I prefer-the Lenovo/Thinkpad line is too stiff for me).  The Lenovo performs slightly better in every day tasks (faster hard drive & cpu) and a fair bit faster in graphics intensive applications (e.g. games).

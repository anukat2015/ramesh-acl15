Title: Surprised...
Content:
The heater looks great. Unfortunately, until I purchased it and red the requirements, I had no idea what was needed in order to connect and use it in my garage. This heater cannot be connected to a supply less than a 100 Lb. tank! I look forward to completing the install in my garage as soon as I finish the drywall & wiring. This heater requires that you create two-vents in the room that it's used-in. One must be 12" from the floor and one must be 12" from the ceiling. Also, take note that using a 100 Lb. Propane Gas Tank will require a "Permit" issued by the local Building inspector...

Title: Where's the heat?
Content:
I just bought this and had it on all night and my room is still freezing.  You have to put your hand right next to it to feel any heat.  If you stand a foot away you can't feel anything.  Plus, it's kind of noisy.  The only good thing is that it seems to be pretty sturdy and it looks nice.  I also like the tower because it disperses the heat about a foot and a half off the ground, unlike some of the other models.

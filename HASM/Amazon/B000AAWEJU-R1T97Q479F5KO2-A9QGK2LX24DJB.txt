Title: Very disappointed
Content:
I purchased the Miele Carina vacuum to replace a Kenmore canister vacuum that is falling apart.
The Kenmore, even in its dilapidated state is a better vacuum for the same price as the Miele. The controls for the Miele are on the canister itself which requires the user to bend down every time he or she wishes to change the setting. The floor/carpet switch on the head is hard to switch and again requires the user to bend down.
It is OK for use on a floor, we have saltillo tile and it works OK. But on low pile carpeting it was incredibly hard work pushing the vacuum around.
I'm sticking with my old Kenmore.

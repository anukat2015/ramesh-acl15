Title: Thermostat is adjustable--the fan speeds are not.
Content:
I use this in my office which is fairly small. On cold days the office temps can drop to 65 degrees. I put the heater under my counter-style desk to hold the heat closer to my feet. Even then I need to have the position of the heater balanced between my 2 feet in order to feel the heat on both feet. And its only about 6" from my toes. However, on the warmer days where the office temp is more like 67-69 degrees, then it seems to do a better job of heating the whole area under my desk. However, I'm greatly frustrated that I cannot tell any difference between the 1st & 2nd speeds on this fan. And like the other reviewers--I am frustrated that there is no real "turn-off" switch. Unlike the one guy who didn't mind pulling the plug out to turn it off, my office has very few outlets & I'd have to crawl under my desk to plug & unplug it in. 
Oh well, it does keep me warmer, with a moderate amount of fan-noise which at times is frustrating when I interview my clients.

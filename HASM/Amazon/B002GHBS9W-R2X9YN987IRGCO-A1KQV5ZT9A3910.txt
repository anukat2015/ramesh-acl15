Title: Black & Decker 12 cup Programmable Coffeemaker
Content:
Dont buy this coffeemaker! The first one I recvd leaked from under the plastic rim. The 2nd drips no matter how you try to pour it. Unless you enjoy licking your coffee off of the counter or pouring it into a cup over a sink and wasting half the pot, buy a Mr. Coffee coffee maker. Black and Decker should recall all those made and replace them. Shame on Black and Decker for making such a piece of junk!Black & Decker CM1010B 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe

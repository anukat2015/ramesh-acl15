Title: Love this vacuum
Content:
I needed a new vacuum and like I always do I read consumer reports to find out which one is highly rated. This machine and one from sears were rated the highest until I read complaints about the sears machine having intermittent electrical problems with the power head. This machine will clean anything you need it to do and being able to lower the power of the suction is a great feature. Only one thing that it should have is a way to adjust the power heads level for different heights of carpet or rugs. This is only drawback to this machine.

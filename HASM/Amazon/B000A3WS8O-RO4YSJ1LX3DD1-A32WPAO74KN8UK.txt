Title: Nice doorstop
Content:
My first 4G. IPod stopped working after nine months - the harddrive gave up the ghost. Apple was nice enough to replace the IPod with a new one. This one stopped working after another 4 months. Harddrive failure, again. This time it was out of warranty, and I'm SOL. What a POS. But hey, for a $10-of-materials-made-in-China-doorstop, it looks purty.

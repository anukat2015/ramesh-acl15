Title: iPod Nano 16GB
Content:
After researching iPods I chose the Nano 16 GB. I would have liked the extra space of the hard drive model but wasn't sure how fragile it would be.
Amazon has the best price, and if you choose free shipping you don't pay shipping or sales tax. Happy with my choice so far. I bought a case, armband, and 120 volt charger from BestBuy, now I don't need to leave the computer on to recharge it. I have a 1 GB iPod Shuffle as well, so I knew 8 GB Nano wouldn't be enough space. I was constantly reloading the Shuffle, amazing how quickly you can get tired of only 12 hours of music played over and over.
Amazon came through on the shipping, the product shipped the day after I ordered it and USPS delivered it quickly (their tracking sucks tho')

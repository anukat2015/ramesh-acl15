Title: I thought it would be nicer
Content:
I expected more from Electrolux Eureka, but at $101.00 maybe I got what I paid for. 
Negatives- The machine is too noisy and generates heat so that the carrying handle gets hot. The metal adjustable wand is heavy compared to my old plastic non adjustable wand, so I continue to use the old one. The floor brush has an awkward feeling which I do not like, so I continue to use an old one I have. 
Positives- I like the light hose, the HEPA filter and the strong suction. Changing regular filter and HEPA are convenient. Machine is compact, good wheels, on-off switch and extra attachments are good enough.

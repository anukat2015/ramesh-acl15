Title: Love it
Content:
I already work on a Mac OS X at work, so I knew I loved Apple. But I went home to a Dell PC which is older than dirt and very slow. I ordered the MacBook Pro and will never go back to PC. My husband, who wanted to buy a PC since they are less expensive is now a convert too. The Pro is high speed, looks great and easy to travel with. Highly recommended.

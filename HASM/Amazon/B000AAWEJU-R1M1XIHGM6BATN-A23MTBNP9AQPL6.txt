Title: Best vacuum ever for hard floors!
Content:
My family and I have owned and used this vacuum for 5 years now. Itis great for all hard floors and a bunch of short pile rugs around the house. It is so lightweight and maneuverable; in general way more useful than an upright. My 9 year old is able to help out it is so easy to use! It picks up all kinds of hair, fur, dust, dirt and small leaf bits. And not a spec of it comes back out in the vacuum exhaust! It was great with the standard bags, but we've upgraded it with the HEPA filter just in case. Given that and the sealed system, this is the best vacuum on the market for indoor allergies for the money.
In reference to the one-star reviewer, I haven't tried to vacuum a penny, but wouldn't really want to. It does, however, pick up small legos, much to my kids dismay. You might consider a "shop" vac for vacuuming leaves or larger, heavier objects. I use one myself for different cleaning tasks. Designing one vacuum to do all things well is probably not practical, from either an engineering or cost standpoint. I looked up "hepa shop vac" online and saw a machine for the same price that I certainly wouldn't want to try pulling all over the house.
We vacuum a 2000 sq ft home every week that is inhabited by 2 adults, 2 messy little boys and one furry dog -- this vac picks up everything we need it to and the bag lasts at least two months, notably with NO SMELL. (Take that you stinky Oreck in the basement waiting to go to Goodwill.) And yes, the 30 ft. retractable cord is pretty cool too! I am a very picky house keeper and this is the best vacuum we have ever owned both in performance and build quality.

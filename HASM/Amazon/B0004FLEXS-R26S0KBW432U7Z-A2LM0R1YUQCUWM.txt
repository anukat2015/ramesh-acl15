Title: Wish it worked
Content:
I really like the style of this coffeemaker and how it made coffee but less than one month after I purchased it it went completely dead, no lights, no clock, no coffee.  I have spent several hours on the computer and phone trying to get a call back for service or return.  There is no Black and Decker service center listed in the phone book or on the internet in our area (Boise), come on, we're not that small.  After 20 minutes on hold for their customer service I left a phone number to return a call to me-we'll see.   I liked the coffeemaker (while it worked) but Black and Decker needs to have better customer service.

Title: Pretty good, nothing fancy
Content:
Well, I like my little stone, it's easy to use and fairly good looking- verrryyy tiny.  The earbuds that came with it are almost completely useless, they fell out of my ears 8 times in twenty minutes, and I was just sitting down.  The player works just fine, will easily accept drag and drop music (and Jpegs and whatever you want to stick on it)... but the stupid USB adapter cord is hard to keep track of.  I'm actually not sure where it is at the moment.  All in all, I like my little ipod nano knockoff, but it doesn't have any frills, so don't buy one if you want fancy equalizers or radio or pretty moving pictures.

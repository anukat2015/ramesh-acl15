Title: Nice, but....
Content:
I have had this for 2 days now, playing with my new toy as it were.  It does have some nice features and I have to admit, it is fairly quick.  The only reason that I gave this laptop 4 stars instead of 5, is that there are flashing leds on the top cover of the laptop that cannot be turned off, (yes I called Asus).  So even though you may not be able to see it, the LEDs can be anoying to anyone else in the room. The only way to have them stop flashing is to shut the laptop down.  There are also two LEDs on the very front corners of the laptop, which I'm not sure what they are for yet. What Asus should have done is use these LEDs to light up the keyboard, now that would be nice.  All together you really do get a lot for the money.

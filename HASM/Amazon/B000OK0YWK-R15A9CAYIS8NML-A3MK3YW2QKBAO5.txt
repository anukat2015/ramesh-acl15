Title: Zune Software the WORST!
Content:
I have Windows Vista and it is a nightmare trying to put mp3s or pictures into the Zune.  I am constantly looking at the home site for any further development or upgrades and thus far it is almost NON-EXISTENT.
Having said that, this is a gadget with great potential as I like the design much more than the iPod.  It would be better if it gave us the choice of adding music or pictures thru Windows Explorer style format too.

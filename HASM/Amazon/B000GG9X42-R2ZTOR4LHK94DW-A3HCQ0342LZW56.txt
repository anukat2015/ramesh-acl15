Title: Not the best heater I've ever bought
Content:
I recently bought this heater for the purpose of warming my study which can get quite drafty in these winter months. I usually get by with just a coat and a glass of wine or two but my wife insisted I try to purchase something to keep me warmer as I am getting older and my breathing has been labored as of late.  By the by I decided to purchase this heater based on its price and the virtues extolled by the maker.  I must say I was not impressed, it has done little to heat the interiour of my study, this foolish device just sits in the middle of the floor and buzzes.  The room has not heated at all and it seems it would get warmer if I would just burn the thing.  All is not a complete waste though because it does make an interesting conversation piece when I invite fellows into my study to chat due to its futuristic look and flashy lighting.  If only it worked better. Oh well

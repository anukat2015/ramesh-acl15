Title: It's tiny, but does so much.
Content:
The iPod has come through many changes, and I think we have an MP3 that we can enjoy to the greatest extent (at least until the 6th Gen. comes out). The iPod is reliable, keeps you occupied, and is very compact.
I want to start first with just how the iPod is easy to use, and great to use. It can just download directly off your iTunes library and won't have any problems. The music gets there easily and you don't have to worry about glitches, unless your pirating things, pirates never have fun. The music will come out organized and in great quality, it amazes me.
The second greatest thing is that how stable and compact it is. If you put this in a case and drop it, it will survive. In fact, in my pig-headiness, I accidentally washed it. The only thing that happened was the screen turned white, but it still worked. Amazing. We're just about to ask Apple if they can fix the screen.
There might be a few "eh"s in there that kind of make it a little less quality, like shuffle, but these are easily switched off or ignored.
All together, this is a great product.

Title: canon eos digital SLR - great camera
Content:
I love this camera. This is my first 'real' digital SLR after having used emulsion film SLRs for twenty years. I can't say enough good things about its construction, functionality, capability, and ergonomics. I do suggest getting a supplemental DVD that specifically instructs users for the digital rebel, as the manual is pretty dry. Getting into the Canon system is great- lots of lenses and flashes that are all top notch (that is, you can buy anywhere in their range from entry-level consumer to top-notch professional gear). Highly recommended!

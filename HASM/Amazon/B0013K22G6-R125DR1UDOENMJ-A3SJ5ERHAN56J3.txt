Title: Dimplex CFP3652C 20"Cherry Electric Fireplac
Content:
Dimplex CFP3652C 20"Cherry Electric Fireplace looks awesome. The flame is way to dark and there is no controls to make it brighter. The heat it puts out is ok for a small space. Thats all it really is, is a space heater in a fireplace cabinet. The other problem with the Fireplace is it is noisy and can get on ones nerves. The motor in the back makes all kinds of noise after about the 2nd week of use. For the price i paid for this i could have gotten a pellet stove and been much happier. It cost about $40 a mouth to run and that is not savings when you can get a pellet stove for around the same price and save a ton of money and have a real fire place at the same time. Again its nice just priced way to high.

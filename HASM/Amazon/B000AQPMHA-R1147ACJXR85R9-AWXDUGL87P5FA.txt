Title: Very happy with my purchase!

The Keurig B-40 makes excellent, well flavored coffee... in a snap!  It tastes just as good as a brewed cup with a traditional coffee maker, it does NOT taste like it came from a vending machine.
The only con is minor:  the 7.25 ounce serving size.  This is perfect for a coffee cup, but a large coffee mug will require you to brew 2 k-cups.  But brewing is so quick, that you can brew both K-cups within 30 seconds.
The B-40 is an excellent choice for a model.  Because brew cycles are so fast, you do not need the timer option that comes with the B-50 or B-60.  The B-50 also offers a smaller cup brew option, but trust me - you won't need it.  The B-40 also comes with an auto-off feature that will turn off the machine 2 hours after the last brew, which is great if you worry you may forget to.  (If you drink coffee throughout the day, you can disable this feature too.)
I joined Green Mountain Coffee's "cafe club".  Check it out on their website.  Huge variety of coffees and teas. Free shipping and automatic deliveries of your favorite flavors set up on a schedule you choose.  
Great coffee maker, highly recommend.

Title: Questionable build and a questionable warranty!!
Content:
Whilst beautiful, the materials used in the construction of this machine are questionable.  Within mere months of ownership you will note that the wrist pad, which consumes a large surface area of the machine, will scratch and scuff away leaving black plastic underneath.  The reason being is that the outer skin comprises of VERY cheap plastic and NOT magnesium, carbon fibre, steel or any other rhetoric quoted by Sony.  The screen will also probably fail (check Google).
To top this off ALL Sony Vaio F and FW series machines carry a limited 1 year warranty.  Limited meaning that if you buy a machine in the USA, THE WARRANTY WILL BE INVALID OUTSIDE OF THE USA.  
WARNING: Do not buy this machine if you require a durable laptop (i.e. one that will last longer than 36months)
WARNING: Do not buy this machine if you are a traveler as it will not be repaired when it fails.
WARNING: Do not buy this machine if you are a non-US resident as it will not be repaired when it fails.
If you require the above, purchase a HP as these machines enjoy a worldwide warranty.

Title: Good deal for the money...
Content:
I purchased this vacuum cleaner online a few weeks ago and here is what I think so far after using it twice.
Pros- easy to put together, quiet, effective, inexpensive
Cons- doesn't vacuum close to corners, sucks all the dirt/dust/hair to one side of the canister, belt broke on 2nd use 
So... I'm waiting for a new belt.  No biggie- they are cheap but I'm hoping this doesn't become a habit.  Aside from the cons (getting close to the edges is kind of a big deal for me) this is a great deal for the money.  You know it works... it's sickly gratifying to see how much crap it pulls out of your carpet.  This is especially good for those with females in the house.  Works great for sucking up all the long hair that inevitably ends up all over the house.
I would recommend this vacuum to those who don't have hundreds of dollars lying around to purchase a Dyson.  However, you might want to splurge and spend the extra $4 for replacement belts at time of purchase. ;)

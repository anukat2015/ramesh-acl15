Title: Perfectly Portable
Content:
I've read all the reviews giving this device a low rating.  That has not been my experience.  I have an Ipod Classic with the Bose speakers for the house but found the classic inconvenient to take outside.  My wife wanted something to take to the gym so I got her the 4 GB Shuffle.  It works well for her and I liked it so much I got one for myself.  I got the Belkin adapter to use it in our cars and it works great through the auto sound system.  I love the control system.  No need to look at some device while changing playlists or skipping tunes while driving.  Easy to reach while using the headphones.  The only downside is the adapter places the controls near the device when using other headphones so the controls may be less convenient to reach depending on where the device is placed.  Hopefully the aftermarket suppliers will catch up with that.
4GB holds a lot of music but I have more than that in Itunes so when installing set it to manually manage music.  Also check the box "Convert higher bit rate songs to 128 kbps AAC".  When it starts to get cluttered I just delete all the playlists and music.  Then I drag the playlists from Itunes to the device.  A new playlist appears in the Shuffle and Itunes chases down the appropriate music and loads it.  Nothing to chase down and double check.
This is the perfect portable music player.  No goofy armbands.  It's so incredibly small and light I just drop it in a pocket or clip it anywhere convenient.

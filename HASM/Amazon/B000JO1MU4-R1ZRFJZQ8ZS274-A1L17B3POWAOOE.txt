Title: A New Fan
Content:
I never really got into the iPod craze. I have a Creative Zen that suited me just fine (especially the radio).
But when the new iPod Nano with video came out, Apple won me over. It's small, lightweight, and yet the videos are so clear. I'm hooked! Well done, Apple. This is your best design yet.

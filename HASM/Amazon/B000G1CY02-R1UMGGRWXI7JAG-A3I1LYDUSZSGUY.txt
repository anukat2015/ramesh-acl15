Title: This is the best heater I have ever owned
Content:
I have a small house (1200 square feet).  During most of the winter in Maryland, with only a few exceptions, this one heater was all I needed to keep my house comfortable.  I am amazed at the savings I gained by not having to pay high gas heating bills.  It easily earned its keep in the first few months.  My dog figured out right away where the heat was coming from and now positions herself close to it on what would otherwise be cold nights.  I am so happy with the savings from using less gas heat.  Much better than previous radiator-type models I have owned in the past.

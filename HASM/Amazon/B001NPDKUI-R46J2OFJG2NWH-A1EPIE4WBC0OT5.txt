Title: Great for college
Content:
I simply adore my HP Pavilion. I only had problems with it once--the battery died prematurely last fall, but I was able to get replaced in three weeks with a pre-paid and pre-labeled box from HP. It never crashed while I had work in progress. It has enough memory that I watch TV shows on hulu on it without the connection stuttering. 
Hope you have as good of an experience as I have, or better.

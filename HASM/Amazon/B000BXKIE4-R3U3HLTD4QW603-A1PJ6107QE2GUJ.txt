Title: Electrolux Oxy3 ultra light vacuum
Content:
I have a home with mostly hard wood, tile in the bathrooms, a little in the halls and stairs and area rugs the bedrooms and living room. 
If I were asked if I would recommend buying this vacuum, I would say, "Maybe". This vacuum is just o'kay. The electrical cord is way, way too short. Having to stop and pull the plug out and put in another outlet often is very unpractical and annoying.  The on/off switch is placed right on the handle where you hand holds the vacuum. So the power button (and two other control buttons) often gets accidently pushed while you're using the vacuum. Not smart. This is something you wouldn't realize until you actually put the vacuum together and use it. With the exception of the carpet/power attachment, the other attachments are again, just okay.The suction is just okay nothing impressive. The canister moves around easily and is not heavy, a definite plus. 
For me, I would buy a different vacuum next time.

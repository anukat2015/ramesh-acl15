Title: Don't waste your money
Content:
We bought this air conditioner last year. Our apartment is on the 2nd floor and live in southern California without air conditioner it's a real pain. First, there is a lot of water coming out from unit. It's incapable to get rid of it by itself through the window, well, we managed to put a big canister. In a hot date it's full in 4 hours! We should really be careful not to leave this unit alone. But the worst is that it's really not cooling our room. Even if it's on 64F! You can feel a cold air when you close to unit, but step out - nothing. We thought it wasn't a good unit, and we changed to another one, but it did the same way. Unfortunately, we could return because of seller policy. If you need something to stay cool, don't waste your money on this one. Better buy a window unit!

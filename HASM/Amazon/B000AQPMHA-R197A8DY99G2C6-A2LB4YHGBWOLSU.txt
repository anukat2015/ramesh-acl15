Title: LOUD...Disturbing to hear in the morning!
Content:
I was so excited about this product.  I'd tasted the coffee and it was pretty good and easy and quick to make.  HOWEVER, this machine makes the most awful, LOUD sound while heating water...it's disturbing to hear in the morning, while others are sleeping especially!  Keurig's customer service is terrible, too!!  Very unprofessional and not helpful at all!!  It took 4 different customer service representatives - and that was after making appointments with reps, who would fail to answer their phone at our scheduled appointment time, even though I had rearranged my day to talk to them when they were open and I was home with my coffee maker, another frustrating aspect of this purchase - before one listened to the sound my coffee maker was making, only to tell me that was normal and maybe I could put a mouse pad under it to help with the sound.  Ummmm....no THANKS!  And even with doing that, it was still ridiculously LOUD!  I do NOT recommend this product!  A $100 coffee maker should be awesome....not disturbingly LOUD!

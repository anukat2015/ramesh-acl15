Title: Not bad, but not as good as I had hoped...
Content:
After reading many vacuum reviews, I purchased the Hoover WindTunnel Bagless Canister vacuum.  The suction seems pretty good, and I do like the fact that it is small and light.  I have carpeted stairs, and the weight along with the small stair attachment make it a breeze to vacuum them.  However, the canister fills up entirely too quickly in my opinion.  I have to empty it multiple times while I'm vacuuming (and I vacuum often!), and this gets to be quite a pain.  Also, after owning it for only a month or so, the powerhead has started making an awful squeaking noise.  I'm not sure if it stems from the small wheels or something else, but it's very annoying to listen to, and certainly isn't something that should happen after only a month's use.  I was amazed at how expensive vacuums can be, and the Hoover WindTunnel was not very expensive in relation to other top name machines.  I guess this is a case of "you get what you pay for".  Like I said, it's not bad, but not as good as I had hoped.  I hope this helps anyone who is considering buying this vacuum make an informed decision.  Happy cleaning!

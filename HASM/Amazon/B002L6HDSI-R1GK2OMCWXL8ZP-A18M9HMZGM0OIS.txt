Title: Sweet Little Gadget
Content:
After my 3g iPod nano died, I finally broke down and got one of these amazing little guys. 
Plus:
*16 gig (for me, at least) is plenty of memory.
*Love the colors it comes in.
*Very durable. (I spilled some water on it, and it was fine. However, I did move it immediately)
*Easy to use features.
*Easy to listen to the radio.
*Major coolness factor
Minuses:
*If the back-light isn't on, it's nearly impossible to read the screen.
*The screen smudges, and it holds fingerprints very easily. (Hint:If you're planning on committing crime, don't leave your iPod nano at the scene. The police will be able to get a good print quite easily)
*Easy to lose; make sure to check your pockets so it doesn't go in the laundry.
*Somewhat pricey.  
Overall, a great gadget to add to your collection. Have fun choosing the color you want!

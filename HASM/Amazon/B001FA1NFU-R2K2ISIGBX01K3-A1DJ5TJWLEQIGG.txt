Title: Worth the price!
Content:
Nice product with significant improvements over its older version, which I also own. Enjoy it immensely. Only wish Apple would consider improving the earbuds. It wouldn't hurt either if there was a way to replace the batteries once they wear out, which is what happened with my first Nano. Apple should really start considering this because eventually the batteries do wear out. I really like this Nano and now I have an older one also that doesn't hold a charge very long anymore. So I'm disappointed in the thought that in a few years the same will happen with this one. Otherwise - Great product, and very satisfied with my purchase and handling by Amazon of the sale.

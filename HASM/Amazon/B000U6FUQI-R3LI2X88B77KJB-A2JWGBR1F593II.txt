Title: 4 kids, 2 pets and lovin' the Kruz!
Content:
I read the positive reviews on this product, watched the video and decided I just had to try it.  I was a little concerned with some of the negative comments, but I have to say I have been throughly impressed with the Kruz!
I have 4 kids, a dog, and a cat, so you can imagine the mess I have on my floors each and every day.  I've started using the Kruz after every meal and the crumbs are picked up quickly and easily!  We also have a ton of animal hair on our floors and the Kruz picks that up with ease.  I've been surprised at some of the bigger items (little pieces of paper, pet food, bigger chunks of food, etc.) that it's been able to pick up, too.  
I used to lug out my Dyson to vacuum my kitchen floors, because a broom and dust pan did nothing but move the crumbs around.  I've tried the Swiffer vac in the past, and it had little to no suction.  It finally went in the garbage!  
The Kruz is exactly what I've been looking for.  It's so easy to use, that my young kids can even clean with it!  I like the fact that it just sits on top of the charger too.  You don't have to bend down to unhook it or anything, it just lifts right off and is always charged and ready to go.  I also think the ease that it moves makes it that much more convenient.  
I wanted to add, that it works great on cement floors too.  We have a combo of stained cement, wood laminate and tile floors in our house and the Kruz works great on all surfaces.  It even cleans in-between the grout on my tile floor!
So, if you're trying to decide between which hard surface vacuum to buy, take my advice, and go for the Kruz!

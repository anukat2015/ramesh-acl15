Title: Very nice!
Content:
I bought the Sony Alpha 300 in December and really enjoy this camera. The more I use it, the more I like it. It is a camera that really grows on you. 
For somewhat of an entry level DSLR camera, this is one great camera and anyone that gives it enough time to really get familiar with it will certainly enjoy it. As with all cameras there are pros and cons. You need this lens, or that lens, etc., but each step is important and as you use it you learn all those additional things. 
This camera is fairly simple and easy to use and once you really get familiar with it (take some time to get familiar with the various features and settings). You will surprise yourself at the great photos you can take. I have seen great photos come from some of the "not so expensive" cameras. 
So the "art" of the camera really boils down to the one behind the lens taking the pictures :) You never know when you might catch that "perfect" photo and this camera can do it!

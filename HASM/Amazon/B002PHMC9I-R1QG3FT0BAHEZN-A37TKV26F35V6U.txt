Title: no drivers for my HP printer!
Content:
I purchased this not long ago and had to wait for HP to create the software driver for my 1 yr. old HP laserjet 1022 printer so it will run on Win7. They finally created a driver but it does not work. I've wasted countless aggravating hours and have gone to many message boards only to discover printer problems are a common meme. I still cannot print anything and cannot afford to buy another printer. Can you believe HP cannot properly support its own printers?!?? I will not buy HP brand products again!

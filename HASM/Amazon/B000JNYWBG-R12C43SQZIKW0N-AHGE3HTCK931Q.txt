Title: No 3G No 4G
Content:
This is a no brainer for people living outside the US.  The US is so far behind in cell phone tech they don't even know that this phone is so last century.  I have an iPod Touch.  IT's great.  But I will NOT buy an iPhone until it's 3G - at least.  And guess what: in Europe, Asia and Australasia its 3.5 or even 4G (HSDPA)!
Americans don't even know how far behind they are....
This is sad.

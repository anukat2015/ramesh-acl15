Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I did a lot of research before purchasing this coffee maker.  I spent a lot of money, and now after less than a year, I am looking for a replacement, and it won't be another DeLonghi product.  The gold filter disentegrated after 3 months.  When it came time to replace the charcoal filter in the water filtration unit, I could not find anyone who carried them.  I contacted DeLonghi, and they sent me to some online dealer who never returned my emails.  The basket that holds the filters has a plastic piece that keeps falling off.  And finally, believe everyone who says the carafe leaks when you pour the coffee.  I thought they were just crazy and couldn't pour properly, but the only way to avoid half of your coffee running all over the counter is to hold the carafe over the sink at about three feet above your mug, then pour very very slowly.  At least the drips will go down the drain.
A lousy product.

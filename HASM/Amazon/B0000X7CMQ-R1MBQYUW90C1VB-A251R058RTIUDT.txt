Title: Greatest Coffee Maker I have ever owned for the price
Content:
There is nothing about this coffee maker that I would change.  It consistently makes Great coffee.  I am using the brown paper filters, washing the basket daily as well as the carafe.  The carafe does not keep the coffee hot for more than fours hours unless it is tempered with hot water prior to brewing.  This does not fit my lifestyle as I use the timer so I have coffee when I wake up in the morning.
GREATEST COFFEE MAKER I HAVE EVER OWNED FOR THE PRICE!!!!!

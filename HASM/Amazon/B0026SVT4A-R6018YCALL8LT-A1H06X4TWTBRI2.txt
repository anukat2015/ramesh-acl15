Title: Works great in my bedroom
Content:
I have a large bedroom/bathroom master suite, with four large windows, and this heater does an excellent job of warming it.   I keep my central heat thermostat on 62 and run this tower heater in the bedroom (with the door closed) in the mornings & evenings.   We have had snow and very cold temperatures this year ~  this heater has done a great job for me.

Title: I like it
Content:
after 2 days practice, I have learned how to use the mouse pad which was only thing I did not like in the beginning.  Actually it is much better than my dell 640M's.
it also works well to connect to my HDTV which I had problem with Acer R3610.  The picture and the wireless connection are excellent for windows media center's Internet TV.
Now, I have to buy a external DVD drive to install some software.

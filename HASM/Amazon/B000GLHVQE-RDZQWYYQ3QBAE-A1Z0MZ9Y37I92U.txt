Title: Dimplex CS1205 Compact Electric Stove
Content:
I love this little heater. I use it in my bonus room that is over the garage and not as warm as rest of the house. I also have the ambience of a fireplace while I am doing my scrapbooking. Great price. I ordered it on a Thurs. at 3-3:30 and it was at my door Sat. morning at 10:00. Also it doesn't get hot so when my grandkids are over, don't have to worry about them getting burned. I wouldn't mind having some more of them for every room just for the ambience of a fireplace in every room.

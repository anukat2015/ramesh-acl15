Title: Good suction power, but....
Content:
The carpet nozzle is very flimsy...I'm glad I saved the one from my old Dirt Devil can vac. The floor brush doesn't seem to pick up dirt very well, either. Personally, I prefer using throw-away bags...too much dirt & dust flies all over when I'm emptying the cannister (have started going outside to empty it). I bought this model to replace the Dirt Devil can vac I had for years that finally died...not a good replacement at all.

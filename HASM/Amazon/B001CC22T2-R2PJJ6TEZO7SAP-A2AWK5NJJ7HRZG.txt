Title: A Clean Sweep
Content:
This is a great machine.  We never knew our carpets were not clean until we used the Miele Callisto.  It is small, light weight, easy to maneuver, quiet, and works well on stairs. The suction in the power-head is excellent and requires very little physical effort to run on carpets or wood floors. 
Miele vacuums are quite expensive.  We never intended to spend a king's ransom for a vacuum cleaner.  We coughed up the extra money for this vacuum cleaner because American made products were rated so low.  The quality we once expected from American made products just is not there anymore.

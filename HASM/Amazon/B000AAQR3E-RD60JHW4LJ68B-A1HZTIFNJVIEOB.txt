Title: Miele Sirius Vac
Content:
This vacuum is everything I had heard about Miele products. It is quiet, compact, and lightweight. The hepa filter seems to make a big difference in my home. It is ergonomically designed to feel good and make it easy to use.
I am very happy with both the vacuum and the incredible service from Witbek's. I ordered it on a Saturday evening and it was at my door the following Tuesday.

Title: Great product, but I won't order from amazon again.
Content:
I have been a loyal customer of Amazon for many years, but have decided that I can't order any products from them until they stop acting as if state laws don't apply to them. Our state enacted a tax on on-line sellers who have a state presence several years ago, meaning that if someone has a store or business in the state, and sells something via Amazon, buyers are subject to the state tax. This is a law that protects stick and brick businesses in our state from unfair competition from on-line businesses.
Recently our legislature passed a law that helps to enforce the non-compliance of our state tax laws. In response, Amazon dumped over 200 Colorado businesses that referred to Amazon, because Amazon doesn't want to comply with Colorado tax laws.
I am appalled by the actions of Amazon, and refuse to buy anything from Amazon until they change their actions and reinstate the small business people that they kicked off their referral program.

Title: Great heater
Content:
I did a lot of research before I bought this heater because I didn't want to pay this much.  All I can say now is that I'm glad I did buy it.  I have electric baseboard heat and I was looking for something to help save on the cost of operating those, which gets pretty expensive.  I plugged this in, turned it on, set it and it has been running for over a month now.  I have the thermostat for the baseboard heaters set but they haven't come on since I've been using this heater, and it has been very cold.  This little heater heats the living room and adjoining dining room all by itself, and the heat even radiates out to other areas.  You really don't think it's heating at all because you don't feel a blast of heat coming out of it like a regular heater, but you do feel it all over the room.  It does a much better job than the baseboard heaters because it moves the heat around the room.  I don't notice any cold spots anymore.  I have gotten one electric bill since I've been using it and my usage was down, so it is saving me money.  It will more than pay for itself.  As for noise, it's very minimal, sometimes I don't even think it's running.  You would have to be super sensitive to noise to complain about it on this model.  I do recommend the digital model rather than the cheaper one though because it is very simple to set the temperature you want.  I bought mine from Amazon because they had the lowest price at the time and shopping online is much easier than running all over town wasting gas.

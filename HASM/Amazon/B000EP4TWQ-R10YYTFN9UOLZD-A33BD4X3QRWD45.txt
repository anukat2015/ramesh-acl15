Title: Excellent buy !!
Content:
I was in the market for an iPod for a while now and had my heart set on the U2 photo edition.... until I saw the Nano. It's unbelievably small, yet packs the same features as the traditional iPods (only thing lacking was the space). I mainly use mine in the car so it's not a porblem to change around the songs when I feel like.... but that combined with the Belkin FM transmitter makes it a dream !!

Title: Toasty in my new house and 25 degrees outside with furnace pilot out
Content:
My first review of any product.  I needed a space heater for my office since I work at home and did not want to crank up the furnace, so I ordered from Amazon based on previous reviews and am delighted.  Because I am in a new house unpacking and trying to work I just did not get around to having the furnace man come out and show me the ropes.  I don't even know where the furnace is located yet, and I tried to set the thermostat, hoping the pilot was lit, and it never came on. The forecast was for low of 32, but it actually got down to 25, and the thing kept me toasty, the office about 69 degrees.  Outstanding.  It made one creak on the maiden voyage and smelled slighty oily once.  I may order one for the living room, too.  I was used to the "milkhouse" style heater and but had burned my leg severely with one and wanted to try something new.  Highly recommended.

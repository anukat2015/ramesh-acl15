Title: only problem is accessories
Content:
The only problem I had is when I tried to throw a whole bunch of tracks on here at the same time.  Don't try to put 20 gigs on at one time.  Do it little by little.  Wireless works great but doesn't have a huge range.  Charge the battery and download the updates before you try to use it.  I had it freeze on me once and just reset it.  It couldn't work better with Rhapsody.  I mostly use it for audio books.  I am gone from home two weeks at a time and take about 15 to 20 gigs at a time with me.  Every now and then it needs to think after you give it a command...give it a few seconds and it will come around...don't overwhelm it with 20 commands because you don't think it is working.  
I wish there were more accessories for this thing like the ipod. More items that I can plug into the bottom of this thing.  I got the dock and it works fine but it seems they stopped making the fm transmitter with cradle. 
I don't like how apple works everything around itunes.  With this thing I use it on three computers with rhapsody as well as the wifi.  I use it with audible and a program with [...] for audio books.  I am not limited or restricted and I paid a fraction of the money.

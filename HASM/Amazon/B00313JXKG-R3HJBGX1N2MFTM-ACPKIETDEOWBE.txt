Title: Toshiba A505 Laptop
Content:
The laptop is fine. The screen is bright and true with good definition. The keyboard is full sized and adequate. There are plenty of USB connections and the wireless works well and has great range. I did not like the mouse pad scrolling feature and had to turn it off. The webcam is slow and barely usable but it was advertised as a 1.3 mp camera so you get what you pay for. So far I'm very satisfied with the computer as it has lived up to what I expected for the money paid (&lt;$750.00).

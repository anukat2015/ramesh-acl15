Title: Okay device but depends on extra software to unleash its power
Content:
If you use this iPod with iTunes, it then really makes you nervous. There are options online for software that allows you to use it with Windows Media Player and then, only then, it becomes powerful. Try DOPISP...
Besides, very nice design, lightweight, same ole docking connector, which makes it backwards compatible with all of your gadgets/accessories (car charger, sound dock, etc...).
I do recommend buying a protective screen for it.

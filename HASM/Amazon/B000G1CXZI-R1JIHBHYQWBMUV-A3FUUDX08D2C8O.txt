Title: Great heater
Content:
This is great to use on cold nights in the bedroom.
Even when it gets really cold at night and you'd be a fool to not have the heater on, you can turn this unit to max in the bedroom for 2 hours before hitting the hay and your room will be nice and toasty.
Then just turn the heat down to medium or low depending on how cold it is and you'll go to sleep and wake up warm.
I'm seriously considering canceling my gas line next year if this does the trick on the coldest nights this year.
So far, so good.

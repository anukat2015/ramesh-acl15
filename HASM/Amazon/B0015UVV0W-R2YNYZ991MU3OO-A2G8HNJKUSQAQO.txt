Title: Scary!
Content:
We have been using this heater for about 5 months now in our infant daughter's room. Up until last night, the product was fine.  Last night we could smell a burning smell from outside of her room coming from the heater!  The heater has never been moved and is always set to the same temperature so we are not sure what happened.  Needless to say, this was extremely scary and we won't be using it anymore!  All reviews I've read for the product are generally good so perhaps this is a fluke.  
The LCD light on the top is also very bright and annoying - it never turns off.

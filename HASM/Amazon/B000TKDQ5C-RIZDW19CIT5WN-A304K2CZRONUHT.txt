Title: nice little heater
Content:
This little heater does a great job. It heats up rapidly a small/closed space. I've been using it everywhere, from the office room to the kitchen. In open spaces, like the kitchen, it still warms you up if you put it on your direction. The noise doesn't bother me... it isn't a big deal, in my opinion. Although it does its job, I was expecting more... there are so many excellent reviews that I was expecting it to do the job that bigger heaters does! But I'm not disappointed... I will definitely keep it. =)

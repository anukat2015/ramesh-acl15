Title: Nice product
Content:
This unit is nice and small. I haven't yet found a way to clip to a belt, but did but the gel skin. Seems to have a lot of good features. Big Negative- couldn't come up with any way to transfer from my previous computer library (sony sonic) to itunes... so had to re-rip everything! I am surprised Apply hasn't worked around this, although I suspect this increased itunes sales.

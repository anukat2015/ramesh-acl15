Title: 3 yrs Old and Still Warms
Content:
I own one of this space heaters, and just came by to buy another one. It does warms the bedroom or the living room. The home I rent heater broke, and the temperature inside the house was 45 degrees. My daughter used this space heater in her room, and her room was warm and toasty (she does not have an electric blanket).

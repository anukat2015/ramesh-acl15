Title: Truly a Prosumer Camera
Content:
I upgraded from a D8 to this marvelous machine. Surprisingly, I find it easier to  use effectively than its little sister. The ability to change functions by buttons, switches and levers as well as custom menus makes the operation almost easy. There is a lot to learn on this camera but the quality of the photos and the low noise ratio make it a real winner!

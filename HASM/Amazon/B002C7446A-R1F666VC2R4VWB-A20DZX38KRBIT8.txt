Title: Amazing upgrade.
Content:
This is truly the best laptop in existence.  I have the old version of the Macbook Pro and it served me better and lasted longer than any other laptop I have used.  When it came time to upgrade there was no question I would be getting another mac.  This new Macbook Pro is excellent, the new design is way better than the previous versions and the new Snow Leopard OSX is just amazing.  The keyboard is designed to perfection compared to any other notebook I have used, the track pad is actually a pleasure to use and the first I actually use on a regular basis.  Apple once again delivers the best in portable notebooks, the 13.3 inch is amazing and all I need to run anything I want on the go.  Very pleased.

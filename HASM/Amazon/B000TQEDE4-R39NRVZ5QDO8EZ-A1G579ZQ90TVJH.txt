Title: Eh
Content:
We received this coffeemaker as a gift.  I've always used the basic ol' cheap kind of coffeemaker with the glass carafe, so I was really looking forward to using it.  
Positives:
- easy to program
- coffee tastes good
- less electricity.  
- hot enough for me - though I can see why others aren't happy.
However, there were a few disapointments:
- Hard to fill.  Not only is it necessary to use a separate container to fill with (I use an old OJ bottle), but in our kitchen, it's hard to see the measure marks unless I pull the machine out into the light.  (Maybe I'll add measure marks on the OJ bottle!)
- Small opening on thermal carafe makes it hard to clean.  I can't fit my hand inside to wash it out.  I put it in the dishwasher, and it still had residue inside (I assume the opening didn't let enough spray in to clean it, either.)  So, I ended up having to buy a "dish mop" sponge with a long handle just to get inside it.  Now I have another thing to store around my sink.  
- The brewing doesn't stop when you remove the carafe.  So, I have to wait until the entire brew cycle is done before I get my first cup, or risk a mess.
- While I love the idea of a thermal carafe, I really do miss being able to just look from across the room to see if there's any coffee left.  Can't they make one out of glass?
Overall, I think it was a nice gift, but now that I see how expensive it was, I'm sure glad I didn't buy one myself.  Not worth it, in my opinion.  The cleaning difficulty is the worst problem - if I can't solve that, I may just go back to my cheapo.

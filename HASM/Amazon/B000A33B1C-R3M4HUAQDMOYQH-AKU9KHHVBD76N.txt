Title: Heat Alternative
Content:
I recently bought two of these because of the price of home heating oil in the Northeast. Although I haven't had occasion to use them for heating, YET, I did run them to burn off the protectant so there would be no smell when I did finally use them inside. The functions and operation are clear and straight forward. The units occupy a small space and the timer functions well, making it easy to turn the unit on and off automatically. The wheels and fairly light weight (27 lbs) make them easy to move room to room. The only real complaint I have is the power cord. It is only six feet long and is connected to the front bottom of the unit. This makes it difficult to position the heater because of the way walls and furniture are arranged in my home. But facing possibly $5000 in oil bills this winter, I'm looking forward to spending just a few hundred in electricity instead to keep my household at least tepid instead of freezing.

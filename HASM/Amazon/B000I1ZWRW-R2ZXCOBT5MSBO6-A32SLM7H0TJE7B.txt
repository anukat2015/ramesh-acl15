Title: Very nice DSLR camera by Canon
Content:
This is my third Canon DSLR camera.  I own a Canon Digital EOS Rebel 6.3 MP (which I can't use in AF mode, but otherwise works great).  I also own an XT (which my daughter now uses) and the XTi.  With each new generation of DSLR cameras Canon makes subtle (and not so subtle) improvements.  The end result is that each new camera line is subtantially better than the one it follows.  The changes from the XT to the XTi are not great; if you already own an XT you may wish to skip the XTi and move to the next generation of Canon's prosumer DSLR.  But if you want a second DSLR body and want to save some bucks over the XS and XSi, then get a TXi, you will be happy.  For me, what makes the XT series better than the XS series is the use of CF memory cards in the XT series.  The XS series uses SD/SDHC memory cards which are a lot smaller.  The smaller card is nice because it helps save weight, but personally I prefer the larger cards (they are harder to lose).  The XTi DSLR is a great camera and coupled with the Canon 28-105mm USM standard telephoto lens you will have a fomridable combination of glass and body - you can't go wrong here.

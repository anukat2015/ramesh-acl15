Title: Does the job
Content:
Bought the product a few months ago to deal with a front room in a Chicago style bungalow that just never gets heated properly despite a variety of interventions (extensive insulation, re-working problems with the ducting from the furnace, etc.)  Works fine for its purpose - room is much more comfortable.  Disadvantage - the thermostat doesn't really help a whole lot.  I think the problem is that the temperature reading is taken right at the heater, which means it does not really reflect the temperature of the room.  Can play with the settings and adjust to comfort level without too much difficulty - just can't depend on the temp on the thermostat to mean a whole lot.  
Was going to get a second one for another room - but it looks like this product may no longer be being manufactured - currently listed as unavailable at Amazon and couldn't find it anywhere else except one site that wanted a premium price.

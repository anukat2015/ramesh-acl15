Title: Don't Waste Your Time or Money
Content:
I was pleased with this vacuum until it showed it's true colors after 10 months of light use. The electronics failed, and it would be stuck in "on" position (had to pull the plug to turn it off) or it wouldn't turn on at all. When I contacted Hoover, they wanted me to take it to a service center far from where I live. Wasn't worth the time or gas. They refused to work with me and allow me to ship it back for replacement. This vacuum is cute, and it worked well for a short time, but ultimately, it is cheap, and not worth the money. I'll never buy another Hoover product after this experience. They do not stand behind their products.

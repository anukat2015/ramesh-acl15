Title: Heater heats up and turns off automatically
Content:
I bought the Holmes Ultra Quiet Dual Ceramic Heater.  It is quiet and puts out some heat, but it has a problem with its thermostat heater combination.  I was trying to heat a small office area but found the heater would turn off automatically if it gets too hot.  well, it got to hot every time i used it.  After it gets to hot, you can't turn it off by the top button, you have to unplug it, wait til it cools down and then start again.  After a month of working with it, I put it away and used another heater.  I would not recommend this heater.

Title: Good purchase
Content:
I purchased this vacuum because I have a bad back and the vacuum is extremely light. This is the lowest priced Miele canaster unit. I wish it came with the handle that is offered on it's more expensive unit, but did not need all the other options the more expensive unit came with. 
Bottom line is I am happy with it, it allows me to clean my stairs and works well on both hard floors and carpet.

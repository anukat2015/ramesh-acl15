Title: Good luck with support
Content:
I bought from Sony for $2000 + tax.  I had trouble getting started and talked at length to someone in India who knew less than I did about the unit- it took 3 weeks and a return to the repair center to fix a problem which could have been taken care of on the telephone by someone who knew what was what - I never could reach such a person.  The user manual is a joke, it has little information.  The web site with "additional " info is even worse.  If I had not known about the GPS function I would never even have suspected it because the user manual does not even mention it!!
Overall Sony support was pathetic.  The computer is OK, but if you don't know how to use it you are pretty much on your own.

Title: Most Laptop for your Money Period!
Content:
I'm not going to leave a technical, exhaustive review, I will leave that for the others who get into doing that.
Let me just list the pro's and con's.
Pro's:  
...battery life is for real
...never gets hot
...keyboard is awesome after you get used to it, and I type 50-plus words a minute
...light
...closest to a macbook without paying $1200
...most laptop for the money period!
Con's:
...the crapware
P.S.  This one star guy who got a laptop with a broken seal from Amazon supposedly?  That's an Amazon shipping issue, not a Acer Laptop issue!
If you want an awesome laptop.  Buy it!
If you want a crappy one, there are plenty to choose from that will save you 1-200 dollars.

Title: When only the best will do!
Content:
This is our second Bunn.  The first lasted over 20 years, finally wore out.  We got a good price, although Bunn are more expensive than other models.  This one is a beauty, takes up less space, has two features that are new for us.  You can switch off the water heater when going away for awhile, as we do. The top cover also slides, and when it is slid open holds the water poured in so that it does not start sending the coffee into the caraffe until you are ready.  
It should do us for another 20 years.

Title: A nice laptop but not a thin and light
Content:
ASUS produces nice laptops. This one is also a decent product but it was thicker and heavier than I expected. I had a few issues with the touchpad and contacted the ASUS tech-support. They were very quick to respond but the issues were not totally resolved. Battery life is awesome and the computer is quite capable to handle many tasks at once despite a lower-speed CPU.

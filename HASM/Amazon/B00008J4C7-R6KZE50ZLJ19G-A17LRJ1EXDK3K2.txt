Title: great little vacuum
Content:
Let me start out by saying that I would ONLY recommend this product for hard floors, wood and tile.  I would HATE this product if I was usuing it on carpet, so maybe that's why this has such a poor rating.  I was really surprised the see such a low rating on this vacuum.  I purchased this product at a local store and immediately brought it home to use it.  I couldn't believe how great the suction is on the product. I have 2 young boys and 2 dogs, so my floors generally  get dirty very fast.  Lots of leaves and grass brought in on the dogs and lots of dirt, sand and food from the kids.  This little vacum makes short work of cleaning it up.  
The only negative I have discovered so far it it's extremly short cord.  I generally use an extension cord with it so that I don't have to be moving to a new plug all the time.  
I really like that it is bagless and very easy to empty and clean up. 
I find the rotating carpet attachment very poorly designed and not very useful. I use it to clean the kitchen and living room rugs for light dirt but not on my upstairs carpets.  I do use the small rotating attachment for the carpet on the stairs and find that it works very well for the job.  
i highly recommend this product to anyone who has hard floors that need to be cleaned regularly.  This product is lightweight and easy to move around, I am also 6 months pregnant, so lifting heavy objects is not something I do very often if at all.  I can easily carry this up the stairs to the bathrooms and not feel winded at all.

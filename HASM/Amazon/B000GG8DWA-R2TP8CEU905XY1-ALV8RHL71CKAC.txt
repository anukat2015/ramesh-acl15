Title: Good heater
Content:
This is a good heater.  It is great for the garage where you don't want to heat the entire air space.  It warms like the sun, so if you stand next to it you definitely feel heat.  Works as described.
I only wish for 2 things:
1.  A thermostat.
2. It could be built out of nicer plastic.  This plastic feels like if you drop it it WILL break.  I do not know this for sure, but I am not going to test it if I can help it.

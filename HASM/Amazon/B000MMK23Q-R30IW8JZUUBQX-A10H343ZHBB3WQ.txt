Title: All electric heaters are 100% efficient
Content:
Keep that in mind when you think about paying hundreds of dollars for plug-in space heater. They're all limited in power by the capabilities of the ordinary wall outlet, and they all convert 100% of their electrical power input into heat. They cheapest heater you can buy is just as efficient as an expensive one, and they all are required to have safety switches to shut them off if they tip over or overheat. The only differences are aesthetics, whether you want a fan or not, whether you like radiant (glowing element) or convective (oii-filled) heat, and so on. I won't name names, but some brands make absolutely ridiculous claims and apparently succeed at tricking naive people into spending $200-$400 for functionality that's available for $20-$40 at your local big-box store.

Title: Worst vacuum I've ever owned
Content:
This vacuum is horrible.  The filters constantly clog.  The smallest amount of dirt in the cup cuts down the sunction incredibly.  No floor brush is included and the hose and cord are both too short. I don't know what it was designed for, but certainly not for effortless vacuuming.

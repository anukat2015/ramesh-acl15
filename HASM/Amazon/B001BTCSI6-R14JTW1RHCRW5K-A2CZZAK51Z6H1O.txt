Title: D700 vs 5d canon mark ii
Content:
I have been using the camera for about a month with 1.4g 50mm and 14-24mm Nikon lens, grip mb10 and flash.  The ability to shoot in low light with a fast shutter and gps was the close for me.  
You can't compare the full frame sensor ability on this to non-full frame cameras; they don't compare.  I saw a lot of negative feedback on the canon 5 d mark ii with black dot/noise. I know it's a great camera as well. If you want high definition video your best bet is a a low price video recorder dedicated device; the canon 5d mark ii won't deliver to the satisfaction of most that kind of video or audio, 3.9 fps and fewer focal points were deal breakers as well. Chances are you are not shooting highway billboards and don't need 21mp. If you can afford the D700 with the better lenses they offer, 1.4/2.8/full frame fx I assure you you won't be disappointed go for it and never look back.  
Purchased through Amazon direct, camera arrived in good working order.

Title: Love the size and sound!
Content:
I really like how small it is and it seems to have a really good sound to it.  Love the color too and that it works easily with Windows Media Player, which is pretty much standard on all PC's.  All in all, seems like a great item.  Don't like that you have to keep all the music on your PC in order for it to stay on the Zune, but it isn't a huge deal.

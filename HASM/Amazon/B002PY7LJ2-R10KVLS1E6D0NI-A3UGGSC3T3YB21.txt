Title: This is a GREAT computer!
Content:
I am a dedicated Mac User -- have been since 1984 (Owned the first Mac 128). I have 3 Macs in my house. I wanted a small netbook to take to work. Mac doesn't have one. I also didn't want to spend a lot. So when I saw this on Amazon and read the reviews, I thought it was a fairly cheap way to try a new PC with Win 7. I find it to be VERY nice. It plays well with all my accessories (drives, printers, etc -- everything but my AppleTV -- which I didn't expect would work). It is fast, the keyboard is full size and easy to use -- sound is very good -- the trackpad works as it should -- the screen is really nice -- much better than the 10" netbooks I see others using at work. I am really pleased with this computer! I must say, to be "fair and balanced", the Win software is not as nice as MAC OSX. I find it to be a lot more intrusive, and I get a lot of "messages" telling me I should update and sign on for a new program somewhere. I have been ignoring them for the most part. I am also more concerned about viruses, and malware, etc, which I don't find to be a problem with my Macs (Yes -- I have virus protection on my Macs -- but have never "caught" any). So I guess that is my only negative -- just an uneasiness about having to deal with Microsoft and the virus problem. It is easy to use, though. I thought it would take me longer to learn my way around.
One last thing -- my wife LOVES the color -- says it matches the kitchen decor (it does). Now I bet I am going to have to get her one too -- Nah -- she won't give up her MacBook. Good thing -- this little baby is now 50 bucks more now. Glad I bought when I did!
If you are seriously looking for a good notebook -- get this -- REALLY!

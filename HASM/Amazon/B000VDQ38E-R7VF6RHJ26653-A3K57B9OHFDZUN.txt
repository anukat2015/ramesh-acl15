Title: Its all they say it is
Content:
I read the reviews here on Amazon about the Bissell and encouraged by what I read I purchased one.  I have 3 cats and daughter moved in this week with 2 more so I know I was going to need more than a little lightweight cannister.  It arrived just yesterday and I put it together.....I can tell you one thing
Its huge, its clumsy at times, its heavy, and once more it looks like something from Whoville that Dr. Seuiss invented.  Took the tools off to reduce the weight.....
IT WORKS!  ITS GREAT!!!  My God, to get started and see how it did just doing traffic areas in living room, master bedroom and sunporch I had to empty the cup which was full....the cup is generous and easy to do I might add......also huge long cord so you are not constantly having to plug and unplug. I can see I have so much pet hair I will have to go over areas several times before the rugs are completely done but fabulous start.  I have not tried the furniture piece yet but will soon and will report back.
If asked, I would really have a hard time choosing to give up my firstborn or this vacuum....I only hope it keeps up with my furry friends.

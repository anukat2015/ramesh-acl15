Title: nice vacuum
Content:
The complaints others have posted are fairly accurate - there are a couple attachments that do not have a place to stick on to the body of the vacuum - and it sucks up so much stuff you need to empty the canister pretty often. (maybe once per room or so)
over all these are minor issues for a very nice machine that works well.

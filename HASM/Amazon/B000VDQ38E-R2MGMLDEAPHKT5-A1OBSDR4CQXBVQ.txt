Title: The new vacuum for 2 labs
Content:
I have two labs.  Our area has a fine sand dust, almost powder like, which comes in on the dogs.  Thought I would try this machine as our 10 year old eureka was going.  The eureka was good but always allowed dust to escape when vacuuming.  The Bissell is tight and does an excellent job on pet hair on carpet, hard floors and upholstery.  Not a lightweight but not super heavy either.  An excellent machine.  Now to see how it holds up.

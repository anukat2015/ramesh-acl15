Title: Not very convenient
Content:
This coffee maker made fine coffee, but the style is not very convenient. You can't see from across the room if you have coffee left or not, you can't swing the pot to the table to fill up cups, and you do have to find a separate jug to fill it up with water (rather than using the carafe). Ours worked fine for 2 years and up and died this morning and I'll take the chance to get a different kind.

Title: Life's Simple pleasures
Content:
This little devil will make you smile.  I don't think brewing a cup o' joe could get any easier.  I have had mine for about 3 months now.  How I lived without it is beyond me.
Any short comings?  Nope
Any suggestions?  Nope
It works flawlessly.
Instructions:
Grind beans, pour beans in to filter.  Pour cup water in to machine.  Press button.  Count to 100.  Drink coffee.  Clean Filter.  Repeat.
The non-replaceable filter is perfect.  It cleans easily, and nothing gets through it.  No, you don't need to grind your own beans.  But, this little guy makes it so easy, with the time you save using it, why not grind your own beans?

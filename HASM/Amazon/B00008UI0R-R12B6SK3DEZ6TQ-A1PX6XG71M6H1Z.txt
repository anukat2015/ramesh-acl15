Title: Great vacuum...but a pain
Content:
This vacuum is amazing.  The problem I have with it is you have to empty the filter cup after each use.  I do not consider my house very dirty but it amazes me the dust that this vacuum will pick up.  I have a lot of hardwood floors in my home as well as carpet and when I see what dust comes out of my carpet, it makes me want nothing but hardwood floors.  I can not say I would purchase this vacuum again only because of the filter.

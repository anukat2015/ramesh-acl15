Title: Annoying
Content:
My girlfriend got one of these as a Christmas present, and since she is not very technical, I had the task of putting some music on it and figuring out how to work it.  Putting music on it wasn't too much trouble, just treat it as a USB memory stick.
The biggest problem with this thing, which is why I'm giving it a terrible review, is navigating within the menus and the music.  All navigation is done using a horrible mode button which can be pressed in, or moved forward and back.  The button is very unresponsive, and coupled with the slow software, getting around in the menus is an aggravating experience.  Pressing in the mode button accesses various menus, though it is very annoying that a different menu pops up whether a song is playing or is paused.  It took me a bit to figure out just where the repeat and random options where... and I was even reading the manual.
My girlfriend wants to use it while running, but unless she has a pocket to stick it in, I can imagine this thing will be a burden.  It only has a ring that I suppose you could attach to a string and hang around your neck or attach with a safety pin, but its going to flop around.

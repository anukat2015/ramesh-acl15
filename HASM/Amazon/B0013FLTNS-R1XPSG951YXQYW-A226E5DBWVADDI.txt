Title: Love my new MacbookPro
Content:
this is a great computer and it was the best price I could find anywhere.
filled with a great variety of programs, so many that I am still learning how to use a lot of them.  Mac tops all other computers out there.
I got this one as a replacement for a another one I had for five years that I used so much the hard drive bit the dust and I am going to get it replaced to use as a back up machine.

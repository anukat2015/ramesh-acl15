Title: Not as Creative describes
Content:
I am writing this to inform people because I had no idea that the Zen cannot play Nero AAC.  I am sure other people will be in this same situation.  On Creative's web site they say it plays unprotected AAC format.  It will not play Nero AAC which is unprotected.  I do not think that Creative should be able to falsely misrepresent their product like this.  It is very misleading.  I have written to Creative's customer support.  They responded back by saying my files had some kind of Digital Rights Management (which they do not).  I wrote back again and they responded by giving me tips on how to use iTunes Plus which is irrelevant to what I am doing.  
Originally, to get the music onto my PC, I used Exact Audio Copy and saved them directly as FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Compression).  I used Foobar2000 with the free Nero Digital AAC codec 1.1.34.2 to convert these files to AAC.  I know there is no DRM involved of any kind.  AAC has better sound quality than MP3, but that is a whole different issue altogether.  The fact is Creative is claiming that the Zen will play unprotected AAC files and it does not.  I feel like Creative is getting away with this misrepresenting their product.  They should not be able to do this. 
Someone did make an app that changes some coding with the tag that make the Zen work with the Nero AAC files.  You can find out more here [...]
When I turn off my player while it is playing a song, it will lock up.  I do not think this is normal.  If I pause the song, before I turn off the unit.  It will not lock up.  
Other than these things, the player is good.  Great sound quality and a high resolution display.  The custom EQ is very convenient to adjust the sound to how I want it.

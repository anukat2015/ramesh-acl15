Title: Room heater
Content:
I bought this after reading reviews from Consumer Reports.  I needed to supplement the heat in my family room since my invalid mother is confined to that room,and for a basement area with no other heat.  I was slightly disappointed with the amount of noise when the unit comes on based on the thermometer settings.  It cycles off even though it doesn't feel as if the room is at the temperature that is set, so I don't use that feature. It doesn't heat the entire room but that maybe because both rooms are pretty large.  It doesn't have multidirectional ability so you have to have the unit facing the area you want heated.  It is not a unit that can be used around children without supervision because the elements get very hot.

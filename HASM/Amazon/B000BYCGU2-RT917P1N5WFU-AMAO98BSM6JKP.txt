Title: I love this coffee maker
Content:
This is the best coffee maker and well worth the extra money.  It is beautiful to look at. It brews the coffee super fast.  It keeps it hot in the thermal pot for at least 5 hours if you shut it tightly.  It is easy to use.  The only thing that is slightly strange is that it pours slowly from the thermos into your cup.  But who cares???!!!

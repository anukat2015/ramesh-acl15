Title: Nice camera for the price
Content:
The Canon Rebel XS is a nice starter digital SLR camera. Takes great pictures and has many useful features, which I am still learning how to use. The camera is not too heavy and it seems to be sturdy in its construction. This particular brand/model seemed to come highly recommended from various sources, and so far, I am very pleased with it! The price (at least on Amazon.com) was really good too!

Title: Old School but works very well
Content:
The design is seems rather outdated but I guess if you find something that works why change it. Bought 2 of these to supplement our heating this winter(we keep our heat set at 66-67) and they work very well. They warm up a 10x10 room on the lowest setting within 10 minutes. Takes 15-20 minutes for a 15x12 size room.
We have 2 dogs and you can put the heater against a wall and the air intake is on the top so you dont have to worry about it sucking in fur. And shuts off if knocked over. We only noticed a $5 increase in our electric bill so far but we do keep them on the lower setting.
Overall a great product for the price.

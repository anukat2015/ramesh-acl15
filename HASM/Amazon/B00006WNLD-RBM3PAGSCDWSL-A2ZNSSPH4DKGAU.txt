Title: cup didn't fit
Content:
I loved the dcm18x I bought for the office so I wanted one for home.  This was the closest I could find... I did't need the travel mugs anyway. I was disappointed to find my favorite coffee cup didn't fit! It was too tall. Luckily I was able to trade for the one at the office (where smaller cups are used).  Otherwise I love it. It's easy, fast and efficient.

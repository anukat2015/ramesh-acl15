Title: So far so good
Content:
Just started using it. So far, it's not been that cold yet so I can't really judge its effectiveness. However, I've turned it on a couple of times to the lower setting (there are 2 heat settings) and it's warmed up really quickly and silently, save for the popping sounds of metal expanding/contracting when I turn it on or off, which I find somewhat amusing. I keep it near the foot of my bed and with the door closed, can feel the warmth from my working table.

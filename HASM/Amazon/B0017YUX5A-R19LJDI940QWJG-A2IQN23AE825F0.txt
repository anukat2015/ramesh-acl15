Title: Hoover S3670 Wind Tunnel Anniversary Edition
Content:
I have always used the Hoover Wind Tunnel Vacuum for my cleaning business so I was upset when they changed the style of the vacuum.  I recently purchased the new version (Anniversary Edition)and have not been overly impressed with it.  Here's why...this vacuum is considerably heavier than the previous model.  They have changed the wheels and you can no longer push it to go backwards without having it go off to the side and crash into something.  The brush and crevice tools are small and the brush attachment is hard to use b/c it is elongated instead of horizontal making it impossible to vacuum off upholstered furniture by pulling the attachment toward you - you have to go side to side.  The suction is still good but I like the feature on the old version where you could control it on the wand vs. the vacuum itself.  The shape of the cannister makes it hard to sit on steps while vacuuming.  It tends to fall over and down the stairs.  All in all, the vacuum does suck good, there's just too many features that they've changed and not for good.  Go back to the old version and I'll continue buying it!

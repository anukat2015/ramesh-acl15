Title: Incredible buy!
Content:
For anyone wanting to explore the field of photography, this is the camera! I have past experience with Olympus equipment, but this is the first on the digital side. I am impressed! Money was not an issue, but I still purchased a factory refurbished camera. Word on the street says that refurbed products are given a 500% Q.C., therefore a more reliable item. Of course, the factory warranty is only 90 days instead of the usual 1 year, but most reputable dealers will give their sale an additional year (ask!). On that, purchase an extended warranty; you never know. I have 500+ shots so far, and all I can say is WOW! Olympus stood up tall and proud on this camera, and you will too if this is the camera you choose!! And on any accessories you decide on, make them Olympus as well.

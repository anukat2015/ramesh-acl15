Title: Good Computer
Content:
I purchased the Mac Book Pro and it is a great laptop, I have the one that has 500GB hard drive space. The only down fall about Mac is that they have their own programs which I do not like.
I have used Windows since forever, I love my brand new Mac Book Pro but I am not satisfied with it because I cant use my old programs, it is very frustrating. So I have decided to convert my files.
Besides that problem that I have, Mac Book Pro is an amazing computer and it is beautiful but, before buying this laptop, prepare yourself and look around. Alot of people dont buy Macs like the way they do with other laptops like Compact,Sony Viao, Acer, and so fourth.

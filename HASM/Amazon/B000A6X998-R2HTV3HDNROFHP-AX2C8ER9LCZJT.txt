Title: Great little heater
Content:
This is a great little heater for the price.  I works well to heat my bedroom.  It even works well on the low setting, which is unusual.  I does make a little rattling sound when starting up, but after that it is quiet.  I like the upright configuration; less likely to trip over it in the middle of the night.  The one touch function and thermostat work well.

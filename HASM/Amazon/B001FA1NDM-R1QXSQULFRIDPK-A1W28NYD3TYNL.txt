Title: Audio book lover - first iPod
Content:
Don't do music as much as I do audio books.  Ended up with the an ipod after an exaustive search for the best technology for audio books; chose the nano because I wanted to be able to listen during activities like hiking (which sometimes includes tripping or falling), walking on rough terrain, and running.
Have had this for about 6 months - LOVE it.
Had a scary moment when I ran it out of juice and a recharge didn't get it back on the road.  Got on line and got instructions to reset that worked so I won't hold that against anyone but me.  Learned to just charge it every night whether it's "empty" or not.
Since this is my first iPod, I can't give any good reviews against previous technology.  Wish it had a little more memory, but I love it and feel it was a good purchase.

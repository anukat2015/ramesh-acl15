Title: Great
Content:
I purchased this laptop not too long ago for school (we're required to have a mac with certain minimum requirements) and I LOVE it.  It's speedy and efficient and I run photoshop CS3 on it with no problems.  It has yet to crash or have a program crash (even firefox which is amazing).  Only thing is that sometimes it gets really hot underneath.  I hear that that's fixed with later models though.

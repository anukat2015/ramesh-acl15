Title: Buy something else
Content:
It does make great coffee.  Which is fine if you like slurping it off the counter.  My unit leaks from the bottom sometimes. The "sneak a cup" mechanism jams open easily and jams closed sometimes as well. Both result in a mess. The carafe lid sometimes does not allow coffee to flow into the pot and it spills all over the place.  I ended up having to remove the "sneak a cup" mechanism entirely and brew with the lid off to prevent spilling 3 cups of coffee on my countertops everyday.  For the price this costs these flaws are simply unacceptable.

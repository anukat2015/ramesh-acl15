Title: This pot makes the best coffee.  Percolating beats drip.
Content:
I've been drinking coffee for over 40 years; since I was in high school. I drink several cups a day. I make two pots every morning.  Anyway, I've gone through innumerable drip pots; they seldom last more than a year.  I've had percolators before also, but always bought into the idea that drip was the way to go.  We were at someone's house recently, and they served excellent coffee.  It turns out it was made in a stainless steel percolator. Last week, my drip coffeemaker ceased working after seven months.  I got out a Corning Ware white stove top percolator that my wife and I got for our wedding in 1973. We re-discovered that perked coffee is real coffee - Hot, strong, full-flavored, but not bitter.  However, making coffee on the stove is inconvenient, especially since this was a six-cupper.  So, after reading the reviews, I bought the 12 cup Presto from Amazon.  I got it within a week with the free shipping.  
This pot makes the best coffee ever.  I'll never go back to drip.  The coffee is hot, full flavored - real coffee like I remember from years ago.  My parents had this type of pot my whole time growing up; everyone did. There's also no plastic - the water/coffee only contacts stainless steel.  The spout allows you to pour without removing the basket, unlike Farberware that has a top-mounted spout.  The spout also pours smoothly.  You can pour coffee on the counter or table neatly, unlike most drip pots where you need to pour over the sink.

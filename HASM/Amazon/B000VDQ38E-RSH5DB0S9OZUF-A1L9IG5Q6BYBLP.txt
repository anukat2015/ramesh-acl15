Title: oh my goodness
Content:
WOW, i just did my first vacuum with this.  all i have to tell you is make sure whoever does your first vacuum with this has a strong stomach.  i have a sheppard mix dog and he sheds, of course.  i have had several vacuums to try and deal with this to no avail.  all that is done now.  i normally empty a standard canaster vac once, maybe twice if it's been a bit.  my first time using this and i had to empty it five times.  yuck, that's a lot of hair on my carpet.

Title: Nikon D80 Review, great product but one blemish
Content:
The Nikon D80 is a great camera but when i got it i soon realized that one of the pixels on the LCD screen on the back of the camera was out. I proceeded to call JR Entertainment and they were very responsive and were able to help me get a new camera quickly to take on my trip. Overall, other than the pixel i was happy with the customer service over at JR and my purchase at amazon.

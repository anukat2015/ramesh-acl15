Title: I love this thing so far
Content:
I bought this player on the fly and so far I am very pleased. Great sound quality and seems to be solidly built for how small it is. I love the screen, very clear and bright. Lets you either sync up or drag and drop your music. You can view your stuff on the player either by artist, album etc, or folder view which is my preference. Screw Ipods and their DRM infected Itunes crap. Buy this player today.

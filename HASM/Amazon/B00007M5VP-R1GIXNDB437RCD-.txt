Title: Excellent machine for the price
Content:
I have had this machine for about a week now and am completely impressed.  This is my first notebook and I purchased it for school and to travel with for work.  The battery life runs just under 4 hours at this point and the memory seems more than adaquate.  I chose this machine over a similarly outfitted Toshiba due to it's weight (it's almost 2 pounds lighter) and I have no regrets.

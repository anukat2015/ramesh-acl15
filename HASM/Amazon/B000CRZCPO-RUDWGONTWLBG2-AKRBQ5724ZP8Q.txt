Title: Nikon D200 Camera
Content:
Excellent Camera, and I got it for a great price, especially compared to what other stores were offering it for. I was already an owner of a D100 Nikon, so when this camera came out, I was very interested in getting one. The price around Christmas started at $1500, but I found it for $1249 on Amazon (on a reduced price sale, of course)- I was kind of astonished and didn't hesitate. Fantastic bargain on a great camera.

Title: Computer good, compatibility with existing environment poor
Content:
The computer works great; however, if I had it to do over again, I would stay with 32 bits.  My internet provided security is not compatible and I discovered that many other services I utilize are not accessible in the 64 bit mode so I had to set explorer to run in the 32 bit mode to fully utilize this computer.  Amazon is a great seller, Toshiba makes a great computer but I discovered the expensive way that the world, in general, is not ready for 64 bits.  Lesson learned!

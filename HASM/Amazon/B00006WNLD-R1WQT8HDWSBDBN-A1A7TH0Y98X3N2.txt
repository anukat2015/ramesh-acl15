This is the best cup of coffee I have ever had!! I  used to use sugar in my coffee But with this  One cup at a time coffee maker The coffee is so good it does not need sugar. Also A sugestion is to use a paper #2  filter under the permanant filter. It grabs some silt that  would get through. Enjoy!!

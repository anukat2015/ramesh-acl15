Title: Nay sayers...die
Content:
No seriously, they shouldn't die.....may be wait a few months before passing judgement.  I think the product is solid.  It weighs much less, thinner and the display alone justifies the price you pay.  If you don't want the screen to move. Lock it.  If you lock it, it won't move, simple.  The battery life is enough.  For me at least, it's enough for me to play it at work for an entire shift and take it for a run after.  If you are playing video, of course it will suck up the battery much faster.  But to me, that's logical.  Don't expect to last longer.  Plan accordingly and take a cable with you.  As far as attachments, what did you expect, may be a microwave to go along with you new ipod.  What about we go back to 8-tracks or how about we start using VHS intead of DVD, wait lets just go back to cassette tapes intead of CD.  Yeah that's a fine idea. Let's just move forward and spend a few bill for new attachments and sell the old ones on eBay. In my humble opinion, its a great improvement for the price, especially if you buy the 4GB for $129.

Title: love it, except the vibration noise
Content:
This machine makes a great cup of coffee every time. i hesitate to make a big money purchase like this, but with the money i spend on getting some decent coffee at shops, worth it and will pay itself off fairly soon, i am certain. I used to just tolerate my own home coffee and now i prefer it to the shops because it is more reliable in producing a tasty cup.
the only con is the vibration the pump makes. its really loud. i live in an apartment so am self conscious of the noise at 5:30am when i have to get up for work and like my morning cup. its as loud as my garbage disposal. that was unexpected.
However, it is still worth it for the great coffee all the time. :) I am self conscious about the packaging waste, but love the single cup servings. i got the reusable filter for one's own coffee but am enjoying the samples that came with the machine and haven't tried it out yet.

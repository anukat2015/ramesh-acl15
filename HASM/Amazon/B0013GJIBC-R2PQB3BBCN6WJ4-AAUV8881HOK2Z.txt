Title: This MP3 player is JUNK!!
Content:
This MP3 player was very difficult to use.  I couldn't turn it on unless it was connected to my computer.  The buttons were cheap and seamed like they could break off at any time.  The touch screen was not very responsive.  The book that is comes with has very little information. The only positive thing I have to say is that I had no trouble returning it.

Title: Honeywell Mini Tower Surrond Heater
Content:
We are using this heater to suppliment a 10X40X10'high insulated room in a barn. The other heaters are 3 electric panel heaters. We were absolutely amazed at how much more comfortable the room became with this tiny heater. When we first took it out of the box we figured we had wasted our money but we couldn't have been more mistaken. The fan noise is minimal. We highly recommend this heater.

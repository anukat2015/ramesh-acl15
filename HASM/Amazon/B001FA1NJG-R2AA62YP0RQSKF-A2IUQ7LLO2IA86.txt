Title: Excellent Quality except that it could not display other languages
Content:
This zune is in good quality in terms of sound and video performance. However, even though i use a third-party earphone in stead of the attached earphone, the attached one is too bad to go well with this 120G Zune. Other than that, like all the zunes, the 3.0 systerm could not display other languages, that is one disadvantage. What cheered me up a lot is the zune software, it is so convenient for me to edit a song's information. In all, I like it and I think right now it is a great deal.

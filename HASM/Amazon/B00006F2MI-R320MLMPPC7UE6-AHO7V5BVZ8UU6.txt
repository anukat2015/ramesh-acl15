Title: An expensive disappointment
Content:
I bought one after Buying a Hamilton Beach Brew Station to replace the old Mr. Coffee and sepaerate coffee grinder and thermal carafe - basically to save counterspace.The grinder in this machine is much to small to hold enough beans to make a good pot of coffee. And the steam from the brewing coffee makes the remaining grinds (yes all the ground beans don't even get to the filter for brewing)stick to the grinder making a messy cleanup.The caraffe is designed poorly and difficult to pour - can't pour out the last half cup unless you want to spill it all over the place. Like the brew station - cofee only stays hot about 2 hours DESPITE the thermal caraffe.More disappointing than the brewstation because it costs so much more. Am going back to my old set up - coffee better, easier to make with Mr. Coffee and stays hot all day in the thermos carafe.

Well to give you a small backround I am a college student majoring in graphic design and i always liked to take my own photographs for my work and needed a new camera a REAL camera so i saved up and started looking. I was a little skeptical about buying a camera online but this one is well worth the money. I got the kit with everything it said in the description. It was packaged very well with lots of bubble wrap and protective plastic. I love this camera. I would recommend it to anyone.

Title: not enough output
Content:
I was excited about this fan because of the oscillating factor and the 3 speeds.  Most only have two speeds.  I like "instant" heat.  If I'm cold, I want to get warm fast.  Sitting directly in front of this fan I didn't feel that I was getting warm.  It produces heat, just not where I wanted it. I felt like the warm air came out like a cone, only on the outside of the cone, not the center.  If I stood two feet away from it, I couldn't feel the air/heat on me.  It's just not what I wanted.

Title: Good idea - very poor reliability.
Content:
I love the convenience, the taste of the coffee, the look of machine, and everything else about it EXCEPT that my machine keeps turning off like others mentioned. I replaced the first at the store with no hassel and was thinking it was just a single defective unit.  Then the 2nd machine did the same thing however, it is recoverable after cycling the power.  But this is still VERY annoying and certinaly not what one would expecet for a unit at this price.  I contacted Breville through e-mail and was told I could replace it through the mail but they had no units in stock and needed to wait two months (around May 2010). I queried them to see if they expected the new batch to have problems and the indication was that the problem was getting fixed.  I am waiting optimistically.

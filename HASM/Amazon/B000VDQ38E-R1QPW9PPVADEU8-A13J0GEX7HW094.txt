Title: Love/Hate
Content:
I love this vacuum, when it's working. I hate having to dismantle it on every 3rd use to unclog it in various points. I feel as though I am well versed in vacuum repair after about a year of owning this. There are many removable parts, which makes maintenance easy to a point, but then it starts to feel like a puzzle each time you lose suction.
However, once you get everything working properly, it could pick up a room full of golf balls. Just get used to taking it apart and putting it together. Luckily, I'm lazy and I don't vacuum as much as I should (which is half the problem, I suppose)

Title: Great coffee requires coddling
Content:
I have owned this unit now for about six months, having received it as a gift for X-mas.  I would like to give it 4.5 stars, because of the design flaws noted in other reviews, but due to its simplicity and ease of use I can forgive this.
Pros:
Thermal carafe keeps coffee warm longer
Easy to load basket and it's washable
12 cup capacity means I have coffee in the carafe for two days (and it's usually still warm the next day!)
Easily programmable and simple to use
Carafe is well balanced and easy to pour
The swing out basket makes adding grounds from my grinder a breeze
Cons:
Must be VERY cautious that the basket is properly seated otherwise spillage is a certainty
Cleaning the carafe is somewhat problematic (though a mixture of warm bleach and water left to sit a while will usually do the trick)
I could see the beeping being annoying but it doesn't bother me
Overall, I recommend this unit, with the caveat that you be CERTAIN to adequately seat the basket or there will be coffee on the floor and none in your mug (this happened one morning to me at 630 am, not a good time for mopping up cups of spilled coffee).  The basket design is problematic on my model, but everything else works like a champ.  Perhaps in the future they can have it click into place or something to indicate that it won't stab you in the back - et tu Cuisinart?

Title: Ok but not great - updated bad product
Content:
I have had this for about a month now and it works ok. I wanted a mp3 player with a fm radio. The radio works great. It's kind of tricky at first to figure out but once you do it's easy. For the cost it's a pretty good deal. I like my ipod better but it doesnt have a radio so I am using the Latte instead.
Pros
-Radio (works great)
-Looks cool
-Comes with wall charger, earbuds and usb cord
Cons
-Batt life sucks
-skips
-if you use itunes you have to convert all your music back to mp3's
-buttons dont always work
****Edit had it 9 months and it doesn't work at all anymore...waste of $$ buy an ipod instead

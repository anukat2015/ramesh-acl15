Title: Great Heater
Content:
I love the first Bionaire Micathermic heater so much that I bought a second one. The first one is in my baby's room. My son's room is in the back of the house and is the coldest room in the house. We would have to crank the rest of the heat in the house just to make his room warm. My son does not like being cold and this heater does the trick. We have it turned up just enough to take the clill out of the room and he sleeps great. The second is is our living room that has a sliding door and four windows...which is rather drafty and is also in the back of the house. The room also has tall ceilings and a large opening into the kitchen. This heater seems to work enough to take the chill out as well. I turn it on as soon as I get home from work, and the room is cozy enough buy the time the family can settle down to watch some TV. Would recommend highly.

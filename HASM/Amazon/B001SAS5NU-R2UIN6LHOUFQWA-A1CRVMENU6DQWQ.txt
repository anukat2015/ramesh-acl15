Title: love the dyson canister
Content:
we love the vacuum.  It really does suck everything up!  There are a few design changes that I had to get used to but only because I had been using the Kenmore canister vacuums for the last 22 years.  The cord is shorter than I would like, the on off switch is on the canister so it is a little inconvenient and to change the floor and rug heads need you to push a button to release instead of a foot release, again just inconvenient because of what I am used to.  But if any Dyson design people are out there take note...
The canister fills fast for me but I have a dog that sheds and incredible amount.  But without having to change a bag it really isn't a problem.  The design is small and compact and very easy to maneuver. I couldn't be happier with it.

Title: HEATER AND SMOKER
Content:
Mine started to smoke. I took it apart and found melted wires. I was able to rewire it to run on low only and have since had no trouble. NEVER RUN THIS HEATER ON HIGH. IT IS AN EXTREME FIRE HAZZARD. Good for smoking meat and game, too! Great silent unit. Too far a range between on and off on thermostat setting (3 degrees instead of 1 like the previous Bionaire Console Heater I had)

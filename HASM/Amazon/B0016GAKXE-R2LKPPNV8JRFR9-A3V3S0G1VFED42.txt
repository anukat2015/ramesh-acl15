Title: You get what you pay for: Cheap
Content:
This is a "Zero Stars" rating. I got mine at my local drug store, thinking it was a good deal ($13.99 on sale). I needed a small MP3 player to take with me on the long bus commute downtown. Well, I should have paid heed to the saying, "You get what you pay for." 
Like many of the other users, I took it home, tried to plug it in and got nothing. I left it for 8 hours and it still wouldn't turn on. I tried every possible combination of hooking it up to every USB on my CPU Tower, on my hub and on my friend's CPU. Once I got it to respond but it gave me the error message other people here have experienced. I needed to update my drivers. No problem right? Wrong. I went to Coby and all they had on their driver download page was (no joke) a full color picture of the player (Gee, thanks I know what it looks like, I just bought it!) and  PDF flyer that looks like an ad for it.  No driver.  I searched all over the internet and couldn't find one and discovered many other people can't find them too. Based on what I found here, I'm not even going to try calling them. Might as well eat the money and learn for next time.
If you're reading this, please! Save yourself some money and do not buy this product. I just wasted 13 dollars and I've learned (the hard way) you can't get something good for cheap. Buyer Beware indeed.

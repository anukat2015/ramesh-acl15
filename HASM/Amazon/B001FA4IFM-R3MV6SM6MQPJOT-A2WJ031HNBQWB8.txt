Title: Great for large office with inadequate heat
Content:
I work at a huge loft where heat does not spread everywhere evenly.  After a few weeks of freezing at my desk, I ordered one of these little guys.  I placed it under the desk and now when its on, the heat rises up, collects under the desk and keeps me really warm even at low settings.  It also makes no noise at all and looks great!  I highly recommend it.

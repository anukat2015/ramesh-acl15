Title: Not bad, but not the 5g
Content:
Okay, first of all, this is my first iPod. Before I bought this, I was planning and coughing up $350 for the last 80 gb ipod. But when they lowered the price on the 80 gb, I had to get one. Compared to my friends 5g, it's pretty good. The space is a lot nicer than a 30 gb, but some of the functions they took out I really wanted. 
1) There's no tv-out through the headphone jack, you either need the dock with an av cable or one of the special ones that comes with a charger (which I didn't need)
2) It's really sluggish, even with the new firmware. On the 5gs, you can just zoom through the menus, but now they take a little to react, and sometimes menus just freeze and you have to wait a really long time for it to respond.
3) The new interface is pretty nice compared to the 5g, but one thing that annoys me is that no matter if a song has album art or not, it still shows the album art square in the now playing screen. On the 5gs, if a song didn't have album art, the square just wouldn't show.
4) This really isn't that annoying, I just wish it would do this. The volume doesn't go all the way down. I really wish it would.
Even after all my complaints, the rest of my opinions are all good. Overall, it's a pretty good unit, but it could be better.

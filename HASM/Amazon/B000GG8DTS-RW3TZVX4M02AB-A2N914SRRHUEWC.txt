Title: This little heater may change your life !
Content:
If your lifestyle is anything like mine this little heater will save you big bucks ! first i live in Arizona by myself and work all day and cant think of when i used my central heat in the last 2 years (thats when i bought my first 2 of these great little heaters). i have one on a nightstand 3ft from where i sleep ,it keeps my head warm and a blanket keep the rest of my warm and the house......who cares 60 ,55, 40 does not matter .in the morning the one in my bathroom keeps me from freezing out of the shower ! off to work i go ,never touching my central heat and only burning 300 watts to keep warm . at night i have a presto for the tv room but it is bright and you would never want it in a bedroom ! And last...... there great ! 2 years going strong the presto has to be replaced every year .....i just bought 2 more just to have ,just in case . there made the same with just a little red glow and all the heat anyone would need to sleep nice and warm .......buy one and try it , you will save BIG money this winter

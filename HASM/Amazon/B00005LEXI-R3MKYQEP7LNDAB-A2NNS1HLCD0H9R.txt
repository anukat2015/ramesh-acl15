Content:
The price of kerosene has skyrocketed so I switched to propane. I have my Tough Buddy heater hooked up to a remote tank with the 12' hose and the filter for good measure and it works great. The only cons I have with it are the smell which no matter what anybody says is present and remains in the area of use and the ignition sequence. Starting the heater is just like an older furnace or water heater and it doesn't always work but I really can't complain compared to the hassle of my old kerosene heaters.

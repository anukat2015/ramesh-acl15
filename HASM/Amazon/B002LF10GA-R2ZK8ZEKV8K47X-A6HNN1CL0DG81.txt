Title: The Best 11.6 Netbook for its Price!
Content:
I was deciding between the Gateway LT3103u, the Dell Inspiron 11z, and this Acer 1410.  In the end, I chose the Acer for its value- the most bang for its buck.  I got this yesterday, and after 5 years of using a Mac, am very impressed.  It runs smoothly and I can operate multiple programs at once.  It is super light and nice.  You may want to adjust the touchpad so that you don't drag items on accident, and the keyboard takes a little adjusting to (it is flat and slightly narrower than a reg. keyboard).  Besides that, wow less than 450$ for this?  I hear it will run even better on Windows 7.

Title: Nice and toasty
Content:
I have kerosene heaters but they are messy and require some maintenance and if not in good working order are smelly. This propane heater requires no maintenance and works every time. Propane is cheaper than kerosene now so I'm sold on the propane heater.It has three positions on the valve. Low, medium and high. Will run for 52 hours on low setting with a 5 gallon tank. Easy to use. Happy with the purchase.

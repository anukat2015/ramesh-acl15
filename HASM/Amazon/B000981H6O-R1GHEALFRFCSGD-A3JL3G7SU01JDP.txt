Title: Good hand vac
Content:
I bought this hand vac to clean my kids' high chairs, stroller and play pan.  So far I'm happy: the vac is small enought to fit in all the creases, it's powerful enought to suck out even wet sereal and oatmeal, not only crumbs, and it's easy to clean.  One problem is the battery - it's very fast dying and I find myself recharing it at least once a day.

Title: Best one I Have Seen
Content:
First, This model looks better than the others I have seen. The timer function is a little awkward but not too bad. THe timer works like one of those timers you set to your lights at home but every 15min wich is way too much for a 24hr period. The timer squeeled for 2 days when I got it. It works by a rotating wheel. Bu after that it stopped and works great now. Definitly worth the extra money.

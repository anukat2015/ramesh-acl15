Title: Even heat, controllable temperature
Content:
We got to use this in an old home we had to stay in overnight where the gas furnace was out, and the house hadn't been used for months. The temperature inside the house was about 40 degrees, and we got there about 9PM. We set the heater up in the bedroom and shut off the rest of the house, and within two hours, it had the air temperature pretty comfortable and kept it that way overnight. In addition, its radiative heat is about like standing in front of a fireplace at a distance -- it really feels good. It smelled a little for the first two hours (as it says it will), but the smell was not bad and did not make us cough or our eyes water. Since then, it has been perfect. The heater is light weight and easily portable.
In fact, it's been so good that we moved it into our bathroom at home (on the wheels), and it makes us toasty warm getting out of the shower on cool winter morning. The controls are easy to use and see. It's another fine consumer product from deLonghi.
If you had a sunroom or enclosed porch where you wintered plants, the "frostproof" setting would probably be great for keeping the plants from getting to cold.

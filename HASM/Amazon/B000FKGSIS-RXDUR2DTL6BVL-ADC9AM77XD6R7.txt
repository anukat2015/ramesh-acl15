Title: lasted one week
Content:
We are really paying the price for our cheap Chinese imports now.  Holmes products used to be halfway decent, but this is a piece of junk.  It seemed okay at first but in just over a week it began to cut off for no reason (set for 80 degrees, shut off when the room was at 57 degrees, so it wasn't the thermostat).  I had to reset it -- unplug, wait ten minutes, restart -- but it shut down again almost immediately.  While the fan IS nice and quiet, it's almost useless.  You have to get within a foot of the heater to feel any heat.  
This unit is going back to the store, where I hope to find a heater not made of plastic. My guess is that Holmes paid its Chinese manufacturer less than five bucks for this unit and most of the rest of the price to their shareholders.  We won't even talk about the pay and conditions for the workers who made it.   Keep supporting those free trade deals, folks, and we'll have more of the same or worse!

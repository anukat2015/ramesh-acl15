Title: Was great for a while
Content:
This heater was great when it worked.  I got it for the remote control. Had it for almost 2 years with fairly light use under my desk at work, no more than 4 hours in a single day.  I'm in northern CA so the weather isn't extreme.  Won't stay on now no matter what we do. Seems like it should have lasted longer than 2 years.

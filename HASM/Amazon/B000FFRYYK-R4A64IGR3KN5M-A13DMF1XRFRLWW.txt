Title: bunn rules
Content:
just bought this coffee maker a few weeks ago and forgot what it is like to own a bunn. I had a bunn almost 10 years ago and went to a programmable coffee maker glad i made the switch back. this coffee comes out hot. thermal crafe keeps coffee warm and drinkable for at least 2 hours. i have no problems with grinds in the coffee or leaking. i love that the pot is brewed in 3 minutes, who needs a programmable! With programmable coffee makers the coffee has to be put in at night which will lessen the coffee flavor. go with the bunn. great product.

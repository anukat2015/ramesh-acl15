Title: Not an i pod
Content:
This was a gift for my son.  He was very excited after seeing it advertised.  However, after getting it for Christmas, he found it impossible to use and too complicated.  We returned it for an i pod touch.  Unfortunately, it also cost me a restocking fee, but I wanted him to be able to use his gift, so it was worth it.

Title: Beware of seller called ** Todays Concept **
Content:
I ordered this heater from Todays Concept & paid for it (virtually via Paypal) on 11/24/07. Amazon's stock meter said that Todays Concept got these IN STOCK. But nope, the guy just kept avoiding the repeat ship date questions cos' he got zero in stock, as of 12/5/07, words from this guy was: A few more days before he could ship out. On 12/6/07, Amazon stepped in & canceled the order. And still, not a single apology from Todays Concept. Sure that he never took my money, but he wasted nearly 2 weeks of my time while Mass. has been having sub-freezing temperature since 2 weeks ago. Beware of Todays Concept, don't trust their IN STOCK claim. I ordered another one from Amazon today & within 2 hours, I got a tracking # already!

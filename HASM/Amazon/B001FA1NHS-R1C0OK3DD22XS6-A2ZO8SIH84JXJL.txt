Title: Amazing
Content:
This is an excellent device.  The only problems I have had with the device is (i) the shake-to-shuffle feature will occassionaly shuffle when I didn't intend a shuffle (this feature can be turned off) and (ii) I had some difficulty importing calendar information, however, I suspect few people use the calendar feature.  I like the scratch resistant casing on this generation better than some other current and past iPod models.

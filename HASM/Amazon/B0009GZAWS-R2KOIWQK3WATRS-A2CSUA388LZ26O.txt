Title: Great camera, but I would have liked a little more...
Content:
This is hands down a great camera, just read the other reviews.  However being into photography there are two features I would like that you won't find on the D50.  
No illuminated LCD panel.  
If you don't do night photography, then you won't care, but not having this is a real bummer.  Some of the controls on the camera take holding a button and turning the dial, and even if you have a flashlight you really need three hands to adjust your settings quickly in the dark.
No White-Balance fine tuning.
Not a huge deal, there are the presets, and you can use a custom white-balance from a gray card.  However you can't fine tune it.  Probably not something you'd care about if you just shoot in full auto!
Otherwise great camera!

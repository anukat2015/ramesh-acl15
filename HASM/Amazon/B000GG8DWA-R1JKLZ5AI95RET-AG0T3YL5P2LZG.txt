Title: Optimus portable heater.
Content:
Have been very satisfied since purchasing this product. It is very lightweight and portable. Very nice heater for such a small price. Great for extra heat in small room space. If you are looking to heat a larger room, I suggest a higher wattage model. The 400w-800w setting is great to keep a little extra warm in a room that you keep at 68o or cooler. Nice and easy control knob. Has tip-over automatic shut off feature. Would buy again.

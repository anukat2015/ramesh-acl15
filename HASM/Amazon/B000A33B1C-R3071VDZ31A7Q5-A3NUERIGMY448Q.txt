Title: First Time Space Heater User - Love it!
Content:
I've been using my new DeLonghi for the past couple of days.  At first I was disappointed that the warm air was only coming out of the top so you didn't get instant gratification, but I've found if I run it on low during the day (for my kitties) then when I come home the house is nice and toastie and I don't have to set it on medium or high.  How wonderful is that ............ and this will keep my oil bills low.  It's dipped in the 40 degree area outside and the house was nice and comfortable.  I couldn't be more pleased.  I've shared my experience with other family members and now they're going out and buying this model as well.

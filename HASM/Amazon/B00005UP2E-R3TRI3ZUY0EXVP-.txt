Title: don't buy this vacuum cleaner
Content:
Yes this canister vac is bagless, but what exactly does that mean?  It means wear a surgical mask when you empty the bin because the dust and dirt will go flying...  (they tell you to replace them every other year...HA! that might work if you have a small apartment with no rugs, kids, animals or dirt.) This is a bad deal all around.  Approach with utmost caution.

Title: Faulty product that Apple won't stand behind
Content:
You'll be sorry if you get a lemon because Apple will simply leave you out to dry. They have their groves of fanatics who would buy an Apple branded turd for $500 so they have no need to take care of the customer. I have exclusively used Macs for 10 years now so I am not an Apple hater but this is the second iPod nano in my family to suffer a premature demise so I am incensed over the lack of quality in the iPod line.
I bought this iPod for my son for Christmas. He had the thing 5 stinking months and it no longer works! Now if he didn't take care of it I wouldn't raise such a stink but he BABIED this thing wiping it down and always putting it in a safe spot. One day it began leaking battery acid for no reason yet Apple claims "accidental damage." How? How does the average person who simply sits and/or lays down to fall asleep to music damage a battery encased in an aluminum shell? THEY DON'T your faulty product is too blame! But lo Apple's lack of customer support leaves us with yet another apple branded paper weight (and not a very good one at that!)
Save your money and buy a Zen for a third of the price. My wife's Zen went through an entire wash cycle and through the entire dry cycle only to still be working great! It may not have a shiny half eaten apple on it but at least it's durable and still works.
Oh well, there is my rant. I am sure no one cares but I feel a little better. Wait... APPLE YOU SUCK! Now I feel much better.

Title: Just what he wanted
Content:
I bought this camera for my boyfriend for his birthday. His last digital camera was nowhere near as extensive but this one has proved to be perfect for him. He's been reading thru the manual learning things here and there. It's his first digital SLR. It's not too complicated to take out of the box and begin shooting but it does have the bells and whistles to grow into for a beginner. I don't know that much about SLR cameras either but he's estatic and that's all that matters.

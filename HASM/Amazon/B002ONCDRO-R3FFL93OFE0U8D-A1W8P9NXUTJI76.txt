Title: Good purchase
Content:
Bought this laptop for my wife, The AMD "brain" works better than I expected. Much less crap installed then typical Dell products. So you have less work in uninstalling from the very beginning. So far everything works fine. It all depends what this laptop is used to do. My wife types long documents in MS Office (which opens very quickly nicely and with no problems ) Internet, mail etc etc - all works fine. Wifi no problems. The design is very modern, my wife was very happy and still can find a 17` laptop that looks just as good.

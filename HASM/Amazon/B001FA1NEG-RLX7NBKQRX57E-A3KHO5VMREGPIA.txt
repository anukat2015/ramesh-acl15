Title: A Stick Of Gum That Plays Music
Content:
I have an older Nano that I really enjoy, but wanted to get a new one for the video and photo features.  (Mine is the older older one).  The design of this Nano is very thin and light, which I love, and the screen, although small, does allow me to carry photos and video around with me.
I have really enjoyed having this and all the music and video right with me, slips easily into a pocketbook and seems to be the size of a stick of gum just about,  Until you hold one, it words really do not show how thin it is.
I do use my older Nano and shuffle for working out, since I have things to hold them and they seem a bit "tougher."  It is not that I have had any issues with the new one, I have just sort of fell into using it for different things.
Some of the older items will not work with this, but it really is a completely different design.  For the features it added to what I had, it was a good purchase.

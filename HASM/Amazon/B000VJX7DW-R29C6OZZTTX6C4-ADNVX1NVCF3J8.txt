Title: Nikon's Best Pro/sumer  DSLR D-300
Content:
My personal experience in digital photography began with a Sony 4.1 megapixel point & shoot in 2001, and graduated through the Nikon Coolpix 8400, D-200 and now the D-300. The D-200 is an excellent DSLR but the D-300 represents a substantial upgrade, particularly in color saturation, focusing, noise reduction and real-time display. Using the same lens( 18-200 VR DX lens) has resulted in deeper and richer colors with greater resolution, exclusive of post exposure processing software. This camera best approaches film resolution and color saturation of any digital camera I have experienced. The cost is significant but the results justify the investment. The professional reviews rave about the D-300 and those reviews are accurate according to my personal experience, both in shooting and printing the shots on my Canon Pro-9000. If you can afford it, the D-300 is well worth its purchase price.

Title: Best notebook computer ever
Content:
I've owned eight laptop computers over the past 15 years and this is, without question, the best available.  Its screen is very bright and easy to read; it is easier to read than even that on the Apple MacBook Pro 17", even though the screen is somewhat smaller.
The new multi-touch trackpad is a vast improvement over trackpads of the past, though it takes some getting used to using the pad as both mouse navigator and mouse button.
I can't say enough good about this computer.

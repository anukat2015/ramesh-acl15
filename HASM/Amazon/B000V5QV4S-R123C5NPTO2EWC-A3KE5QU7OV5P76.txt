Title: Canon EOS 40D and Amazon.com review
Content:
I purchased an EOS 40D camera through Amazon.com several weeks ago and have been amazed by the images this camera provides.  They are wonderful.  The camera is very well built and the 28-135 lens I got with it has proven to be exactly what I need.  And purchasing it through Amazon.com has been a very pleasant experience...my camera was shipped the same day my order was received and I got it in perfect condition.
The only question I have is "Why didn't I do this sooner?"Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens

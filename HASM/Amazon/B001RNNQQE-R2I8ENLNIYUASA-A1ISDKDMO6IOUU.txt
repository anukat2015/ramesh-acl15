Title: does what it was made for
Content:
This machine brews coffee well.  A permanent filter (some fine grounds do make it through, however) is included. Carafe does a good job of keeping the coffee hot for an hour or so. Hard to pour to the last drop without taking the top off but quite happy with the spout - doesn't spill all over the place like my last machine.

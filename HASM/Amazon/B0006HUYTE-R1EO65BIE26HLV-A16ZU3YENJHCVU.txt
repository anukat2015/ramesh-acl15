Title: Sucks, but...
Content:
Great vacuum for picking up household dirt, etc....but the noise is unreal!
We have to use ear plugs when using this because the high pitched noise is really over the top....if I had known it would be so loud, I would not have bought the product. It's much louder than my shop vac!
Otherwise it sucks in a good way!

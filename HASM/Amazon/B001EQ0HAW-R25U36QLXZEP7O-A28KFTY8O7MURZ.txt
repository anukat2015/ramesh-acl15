Title: Zune 120
Content:
I have owned 3 ipods (still have my ipod 30gb) and was going to purchase a new ipod mainly to take adavantage of their genius software. But I decided to try the Zune.  The software for zune takes some getting used to, but it's not bad.  
I love my Zune! I love the screen size. It sounds great. I love the wireless sync! It syncs when its in my bedroom on the ihome clock radio without me even realizing it. I'm at the computer downloading songs. I go back to the bedroom and the songs are already on the zune. 
I love the zune pass at $15 a month. You get to keep 10 songs a month! I love being able to listen to whole songs, whole albums before downloading or not downloading. No more 30 second clips. I have discovered much more music I never would have because of this. I spent this much a month at itunes for one and half artist and now I have tons of artists. 
The one thing I don't like is the plastic back but that is my minor complaint. Other than that, I am very happy with my Zune!

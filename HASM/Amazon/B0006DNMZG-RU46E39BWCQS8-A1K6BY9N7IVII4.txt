Title: Throws great heat for great price
Content:
This is a great heater, for a great price. We looked all over for this heater and AMAZON was one of the only retailers we could find in our CHILLY neck of the woods here in Western MICHIGAN. It does a great job of heating a large bedroom, and the temperature control helps to not get the room too hot which is important since we are using it to heat our nursery. We also use one in our basement which is even larger and it seems to be doing a great job in a very cold large space. Not too loud, and very easy to operate. Sturdy. Doesn't tip over. I like the 360 degree heat it throws.

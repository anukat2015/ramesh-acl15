Title: 1GB iPod Shuffle - PURPLE!!!
Content:
I've had a 2nd generation iPod shuffle for almost a year and love mine. When Apple came out with the new purple color as part of its 3rd generation, I knew it was time to get one for my wife. She had been using one of the older 1st generation iPod shuffles as her workout mp3 player. I gave this to her for Christmas and she loves it! Not only does she listen to it when we're working out, she takes it with her on trips as well.
The 3rd generation iPod shuffle is a very cool, go-anywhere gadget that is extremely easy to operate. I highly recommend one!!!

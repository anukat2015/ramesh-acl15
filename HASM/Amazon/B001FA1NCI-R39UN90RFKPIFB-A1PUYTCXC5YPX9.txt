Title: Our first iPod - we love it!
Content:
I got this for my 9 year old daughter, and I have had so much fun learning how to use it.  The video screen is so clear, and it is pretty easy to load.  (I had to get online and do some research on it b/c there wasn't much literature with it.  I am behind the times, I know.)  I had bought another brand for her and then decided to go ahead with the real iPod.  I kept the other brand mp3 player for myself...no comparison on the video screen. I love the iPod more then the Creative Zen.
I see other reviewers aren't so impressed, but I have nothing with which to compare it.  We are completely happy.

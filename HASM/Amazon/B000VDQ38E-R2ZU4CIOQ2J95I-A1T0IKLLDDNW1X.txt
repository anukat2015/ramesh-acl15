Title: Absolutely amazing!
Content:
This is the best vacuum I have ever owned.  I own 2 dogs - A short-hair Jack Russell and a Rat Terrier that shed CONSTANTLY.  After a rather persistent frustration with my previous vacuum not picking up any of the hair they leave behind and leaving my carpet still feeling gritty, I bought this one after reading the reviews about it.
The vacuum arrived, took about 10 minutes to assemble (just 3 screws to put in place!), and I went to work.  I was absolutely astonished and disgusted to find what had been living in my carpet all this time.  The canister instantly filled up with dog hair and dirt.  I'm a person who takes a lot of pride in keeping the house clean and picked up, so seeing what my other vacuum consistently left behind was shocking.  
I strongly recommend this vacuum to anyone who has pets (or children for that matter).  The amount it's able to pick up is amazing!  The dogs' beds were even completely free of dog hair after running one of the included attachment tools over them.  I highly recommend!

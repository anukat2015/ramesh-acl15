Title: Best coffee maker EVER!
Content:
I got this coffee maker as a Christmas gift and so far I love it. I had a Mr. Coffee before this and thought the coffee it made was...okay (if you don't mind waiting 20 minutes). But then I tried the coffee from my new BUNN maker (ready in 3 minutes, no less!) and realized I was drinking crap from that Mr. Coffee. The BUNN makes the smoothest cup of coffee I've ever had, it's wonderful. 
I especially like that it has a thermal carafe, not a glass decanter warmed on a warming plate. The coffee can sit there for hours without burning on a burner, and I can grab that carafe and take it with me anywhere in the house and it stays warm. The manual says it keeps it hot for about two hours (maybe more if you pre-heat it with hot water first) but it's been 6 hours since I made my last pot of coffee (without pre-heating the carafe) and I just got a cup...aaah, yes. Still warm.
In the last 10 years, I have gone through three Mr. Coffee makers. My parents have had a BUNN coffee maker that has lasted them at least 10 years and hasn't shown any signs that it needs replacing, so I am looking forward to enjoying mine for a loooong time!

Title: If You Have Cold Feet About This Product, Trust Them
Content:
I have long been searching for a product that would keep my feet, ankles and legs warm at work.  There is always a frosty draft blowing along the floor of my office and I am uncomfortable all day.  Space heaters and fans always blow upward, leaving my feet and ankles in the cold.  I was skeptical about this particular product but really wanted to believe all the positive reviews.  I'm sorry I did. The panel barely warms up.  If you're not making direct contact with it, it's almost worthless.  I wanted to use mine as a vertical heat panel, which is a documented option.  Keep in mind that this thing supposedly "radiates" - there is no fan.  Well, a 150W radiation panel (which is the maximum setting by the way) is barely more than a light bulb.  Unfortunately, this product doesn't perform as described and is way overpriced.  If you are the least bit apprehensive about buying this product, you should be.  Don't waste your money.

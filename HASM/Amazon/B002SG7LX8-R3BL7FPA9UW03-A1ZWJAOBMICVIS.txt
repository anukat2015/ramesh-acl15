Title: Love These Machines!
Content:
These Thinkpads are the Best They have the look and Feel of High Quality!
I have a SL410 but Amazon no longer sells it, so writing this here.
Bought a Toshiba laptop weeks ago then returned it. It was OK but it looked and felt cheap with the very high gloss surface had to constantly wipe it down. The thinkpads have a matte finish, much better.
Also the Toshiba Laptop had these annoying popup windows that would appear reminding me to upgrade and buy software.
The touch pad is great very accurate, also much better then my toshiba.
Only had mine a few a couple weeks and am impressed overall.
I've been a electronics tech for 20 years and a IT degree, I can say these are made very well. The connectors and interface are well designed. Just wish mine was a little lighter the 410 is about 5lbs.

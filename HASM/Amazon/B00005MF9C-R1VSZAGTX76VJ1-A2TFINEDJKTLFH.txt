Title: One of my favorite things
Content:
I don't have time to drink a whole pot of coffee and I hate to waste expensive coffee by using more than I need.  This coffee pot is useful in the fact that I only have one cup to wash and I only use the exact amount of coffee that I need.  I am on my second pot now though.  I would characterize this product as not sturdy.  With care my first one lasted about a year, then I accidentally started it with out putting the top down and it wouldn't work after that.  Completely my fault though.

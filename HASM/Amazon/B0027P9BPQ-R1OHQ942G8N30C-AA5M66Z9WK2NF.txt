Title: Textured touchpad - try before you buy
Content:
This is a nice looking laptop and I like the design.
As for speed and performance, it's a lot faster than my old Dell so no complaints.
I'm motivated to review the touchpad here because - to be honest it's driving me crazy.  It's not a smooth touchpad - you'll see from the photos that there is a slight texturing to it.  I didn't think it would be a problem but my fingertips - no matter how light or hard I press - don't move smoothly over it in any direction but downwards.  They catch and start-stop.  It's so frustrating - I went back to the dealer and we tried cutting a plastic iPhone cover down to size and affixing it over the touchpad but it didn't stick very well.  Sadly I'm contemplating returning it which would be such a shame.
I don't mind using a USB mouse but still - I encourage anyone thinking of going with this particular design to really give the touchpad a try.  Maybe it's just me, but ... ugh.

Title: New Cuisinart Coffeemaker
Content:
I actually purchased the new black chrome unit.  It is nice to look at but be careful.
There is a major design flaw in the handle of the caraffe.  While pouring coffee on it's 3rd day of use, the top of the handle separated from the caraffe, pouring coffee all over my arm. Needless to say, it was hot.  Please note that this is not the lid simply coming off.  The top of the handle came loose from the caraffe.  The coffee maker will be returned.

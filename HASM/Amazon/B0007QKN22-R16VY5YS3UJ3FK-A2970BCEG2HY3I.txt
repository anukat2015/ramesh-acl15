Title: An all around good camera
Content:
The Canon Rebel XT (350D) is a great start for any up and coming photographer. It is truly a rebel, in that it is a prosumer camera that can take beautiful pictures and prints.  Here are some pro's and con's from our experience:
Pro's
-----
1. It takes beautiful pictures, given the right lens and creativity.
2. It is affordable, especially in the aftermarket.
3. It can take EF-S and EF lenses. (Canon 5D and on do not take EF-S lenses.)
4. Light weight, good for travel.
5. Battery grip allows increased power and better grip for vertical/horizontal shots.
6. Fast start up time. 
7. Seven AF points
8. E-TTL II compatibility
Con's
-----
1. Low light noise at ISO 400 and higher.
2. Relatively minor con: not weather sealed.  If you want to take pictures in tough weather, make sure you buy cover.
3. If you change lenses a lot, buy a blower to be able to clean dust.
4. Limited ISO range, only up to 1600
5. Small viewfinder
Tips
----
* You have a crop factor of 1.6.  So if you have a 10mm lens, you effectively have a 16mm lens.
* Use a different flash to be more creative like bouncing the light off the walls or ceiling.  You can't do that with the on-camera flash.
* Battery grip is a definite buy, more power and better ergonomics.
Conclusion
----------
The biggest issue with the 350D is the noise level in ISO 400 and more.  But if you shoot in good light or have a good flash, the 350D is the ultimate bang for the buck camera.  Its sensor size is also about the same as Canon's 400D, 10D, 20D, and 30D.  If you are looking for a camera more expensive than the 350D, invest in the 40D, 5D, or something higher.

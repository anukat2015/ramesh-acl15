Title: Nice heater
Content:
We have a 700 square foot finished basement which is heated by both forced hot air from the propane furnace and an 8 foot baseboard heater. 
The baseboard heater is extremely expensive to run in the winter. We were looking for an alternative which would still keep our play room nice and toasty warm. Since I already had one smaller Lasko heater and was thrilled with it, we decided to get this one on sale and give it a try.
So far it has kept our large basement at 70 degrees and has not run that much even though it is really cold up here in NE PA.
Now if the electric bills are less than last year that will be the icing on the cake. And I am pretty sure they will be, considering our baseboard is an inefficient killowat sucking machine. ;)
Update 1/21/10
The heater is still working well and has kept my basement at 70 degrees all through the cold, cold winter. We got our first electric bill with the heater running and it was about 20 dollars less than what it would have been for December 2009. (we are billed monthly) and that is with me adding 2 aerogardens and several plant lights to my electricity bill.
One small issue is that if you lose power this heater will not automatically turn back on when power is restored. If you are away for the weekend and get a power spike you should expect whatever area was dependant on the heater will be quite cold.

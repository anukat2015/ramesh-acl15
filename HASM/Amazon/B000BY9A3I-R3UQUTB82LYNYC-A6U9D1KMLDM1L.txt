Title: works well for my purpose
Content:
I have a long haired cat and chocolate lab and lots of hair, I have rustic plank laminate flooring throughout so I need something that would pick up down in the crevices,this does quite well,I like being able to control the suction for throw rugs.
However I also have a large wool braided rug and it wouldn't pick up a thing on it,I didn't buy this for my rugs so I understood going in so I kept my upright(also a dirt devil) I don't see a problem cleaning out the dirt cup,I reuse my plastic bags from shopping and tie the top.
I do wish the cord was longer and had better attachments but my other ones fit on this one.

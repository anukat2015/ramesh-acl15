Title: Zune 8 GB MP3 is fun mobile entertainment
Content:
I like my Zune MP3 very much.  My only complaints are:
Learning to use the Zune software.  If you delete anything from your "collection" you are also deleting it from your hard drive! (unless your Zune is connected to your computer with the USB, in which case then you're deleting the files from your Zune device).  I also went to the "marketplace" and tried to install the latest movie trailers & it filled up the device with 2 movie trailers & then I wound up calling tech support because I couldn't get it to work after deleting those files.  I had to wipe and re-load the device even though it showed plenty of room left on the device.  
Tech support is OK, but most of them have foreign accents & it's hard to understand everything they say.
The sponge covers on the ear buds constantly fall off.  I'm very surprised I haven't lost the 1st set yet.  Fortunately the device come with 3 pair.  I'm always finding them on the floor..
I think it should come with a pouch to carry the device & ear set together. A pouch with magnetic closure would be awesome!
My good points are:
The sound is awesome.
The menu allows you to choose files by genre, album, artist, music style.  And you can shuffle the music, repeat..
The operation of the device is pretty easy.
The display screen shows pictures & videos either horizontally or vertically to maximize the view.
I love the RED color I got. (8 GB)

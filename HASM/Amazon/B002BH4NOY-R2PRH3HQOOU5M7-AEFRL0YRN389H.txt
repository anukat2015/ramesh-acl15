Title: Great laptop!
Content:
I wanted a laptop that would replace my four year old 17 inch Gateway. I liked my old laptop but wanted something smaller. I looked at netbooks but they didn't have enough power for my needs. I like an occasional game or two. I went to a computer store and played with their laptops for a while and liked the HP Touchsmart. The model that they had displayed was one with a 320 Gig hard drive and it had a 12.1 inch screen anp only weighed a little more than four pounds. It also was a tablet PC which was intriguing with 4 gigs of memory. The feature that I found desirable was the touchscreen. It fascinated me and made on screen selections so much easier. It also came with a remote and a stylus.I tried it and I liked it.
So when I arrived home I checked Amazon.com and HP's website. I discovered that there was a model of the TouchSmart with 500 gigs of storage. I was sold. Hp offered a lower price but Amazon had a [...] dollar rebate which brought the cost below what Hp offered. They both offered free shipping. I purchased from Amazon and received my new laptop in two days. I am very satisfied with its performance.

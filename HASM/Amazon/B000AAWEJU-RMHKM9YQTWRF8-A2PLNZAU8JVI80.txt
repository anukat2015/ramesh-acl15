Title: Once you use a Miele, you will never use another
Content:
This canister vacuum is perfect for multitasking quickly and easily. I have carpeting, wood, and vinyl floors in my house and used two different vacuums for it. When I bought the Miele, I was able to get rid of the other two cleaners and use this one throughout.
It does an incredible job of getting up everything: pet hair, dust, crumbs, little bits of "stuff", those nasty dust bunnies and illusive corner cob webs which seem to appear overnight as if by magic (or maybe time to get new glasses!). 
In one room during a Spring clean, I started at the top - literally! Went from the ceiling and the molding down to the walls - curtains - floors - lamp shades - and everything else in between. All I had to do was change the cleaning head and adjust the suction amount. All simply and quickly done.
The fact that it is also fairly quiet was a real bonus. I could actually vacuum while little one was taking his nap ... now THAT is a major plus for any appliance!
I know the price is high but you are paying for the quality of the vacuum - an investment if you will. It is very well made and will last for many, many years. I recommend this vacuum highly.

Title: Over-rated, over-priced, & disappointing
Content:
I'm big-time Mac fan (iMac,MacBookPro,iPod Classic), love iTunes, & just got g5 Nano for Christmas. Looked forward to a solid 5th gen Apple product. Sad to say- this SUCKS!!!!  Case is flimsy. Lots of gimmicky features (Genius Mixes, Cover Flow,etc.) but most important stuff is not there.  Musical sound quality stinks compared to last no-name mp3 player I picked up at a third the price.  Partly due to poor quality Apple ear buds, but sound ain't much better through my Shure's.  And no equalizer settings, or even balance control (BTW Cuppertino-MOST people do not have perfectly balanced hearing).  Video capability is cute, but no substitute for a camcorder. And Pedometer function is so inaccurate its downright silly.  And minor point- why not include users manual as pdf on the nano?  Would be helpful for initial set-up, esp for those new to iPod family.
Hurts me to say, but if nano weren't a gift I would return it. I'm prob gonna e-Bay it.  Will keep using my cheapo mp3 unit in gym & my iPod Classic (great unit BTW) in the car. 
Only reason this POS design is still on market is 'cause of Apple logo.

Title: DeLonghi 1500 Watt Ceramic Heater
Content:
The DeLonghi portable heater is just right for small rooms, or medium rooms that you do not want to get hot while you are sleeping. The timer and the remote control are handy so that I can turn on the heater before climbing out of bed in the AM. I set the timer so that I do not forget to turn it off, should I fall asleep. I do not experience the loudness that other writers c/o about. I also used the heater to help dry a leak after a rain in the basement. The best feature is the heater will turn off, should someone knock the heater over. 
Thank you for a good product-for the price.

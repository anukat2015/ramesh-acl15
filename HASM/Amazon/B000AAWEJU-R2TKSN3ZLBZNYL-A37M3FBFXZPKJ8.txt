Title: Great vacuum cleaner, heavy wands
Content:
This is the 4th (!) Miele I have bought in the past couple of years, 2 for myself and 2 as gifts. (The others were similar but with power brushes, and came in blue and in red). The Carina is yellow, not a great color, but it is above all quiet, and this is very important to me. I bought this as a replacement for an old Eureka Mighty Mite in our house in the country and it fits nicely in the small closet and does a great job on our new tile and hardwood floors and a good enough job on our carpets. If you have lots of deep carpeting you should get the turbo brush. The major pluses are: Small size, quiet operation, efficient cleaning, excellent maneuverability, well-designed bags, retracting power cord.  The negatives for me are that it takes thumb pressure on a button to release the wand sections from one another and a little arthritis in the hand can make this uncomfortable; the steel wands are much heavier than the (cheaper) plastic ones that came with our old vacuum, and thus harder to hold up in the air to vacuum window frames, etc.; the on-off control is an odd panel on the body of the vacuum that you have to hit with one foot and I often need to try more than once to get it going; the cord reel failed on one of the gift vacuums I sent; you have to pull the cord all the way out when you use the machine to avoid overheating the motor, and it is about 15 feet long; bags are pricey and not available in ordinary stores (I haven't seen any generic ones).  In all, however, the quiet, efficient operation and small size win out.  I'd buy a 5th one.

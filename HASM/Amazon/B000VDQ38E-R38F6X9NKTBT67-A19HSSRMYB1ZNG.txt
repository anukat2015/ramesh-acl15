Title: Best vacuum I've ever owned
Content:
I just picked this up last night and after assembly, I gave the living room carpet a good cleaning. I've got a golden retriever who obviously sheds alot. This vacuum did a fantastic job of getting the fur out of the carpet. I had to empty the dirt/fur from the vacuum pretty often but my living room carpet hasn't been this clean in a long time.

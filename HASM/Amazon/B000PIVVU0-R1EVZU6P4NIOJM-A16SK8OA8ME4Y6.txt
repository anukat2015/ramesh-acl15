Title: great if first one, not for current I-POD owners
Content:
I bought this as an inexpensive replacement for my daughter when her IPOD shuffle was stolen.  Bad mistake.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice little mp3 player.  The problem is that all of my daughter's music is under I-Tunes, which formats music that you legitimately own in such a way that you can only copy the music over to an IPOD.  Anything that's not an IPOD will read the music as copywrited and will not play the music.
If you're not using I-Tunes, buy this, you'll like it.
If you already use I-Tunes, don't buy this.

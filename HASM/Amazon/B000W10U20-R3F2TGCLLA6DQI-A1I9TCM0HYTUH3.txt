Title: Overall good but 1 GB RAM not enough
Content:
I bought this for my daughter, a university student. Overall she is quite pleased (the looks, the touch, the screen, the size, etc). The only thing she complained about was the speed, which I think is due to shortage of memory, 1 GB RAM, considering it uses Windows Vista. I will have to buy more memory, but the trick is you cannot add 1 GB to the existing one. You have to throw the existing 2 x 540 MB away and install 2 x 1 GB.

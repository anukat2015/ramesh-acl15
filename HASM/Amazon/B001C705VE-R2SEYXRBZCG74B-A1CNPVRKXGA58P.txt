Title: Not a good choice
Content:
We have owned several Melittas over the years and loved their previous Mill and Brew. When we had to replace our model after two years the style was no longer available. We purchased the Smart Mill and Brew and are not happy. Too big in size, too complicated to operate between grind and ground, warmer turns off to soon, and what a waste addding the weather station in it.  I have replaced it with another mfg model. I would not recommend this brewer.

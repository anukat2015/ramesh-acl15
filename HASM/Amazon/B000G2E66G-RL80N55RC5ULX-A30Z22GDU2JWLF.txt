Title: finally, a portable air conditiner that works
Content:
After getting bit with a 25% restocking fee from another retailer on the Soleus MAC12K, I decided to give the Sharp CV-P10LC Portable Air Condtioner from Costco a try.
First off, the manual was pretty well written and detailed.  The instructions were clear.  It took a while to install the window venting kit because it was a bit more complex than the competition's.  It was a marked improvement over the other venting kits that I've seen.  There were foam insulation to plug the gaps from the window and fits almost perfectly. Also, you would have to remove the screen from your window for the installation.
It was close to 100 degrees today and when the unit first turned on, I can feel that it was starting to cool the room.  One key feature is the horizontal louvers can be set to automatically move up and down to distribute the air to cool the room. One press of a button and it can be set in the desired position, particularly useful if your bed is close to the ground as other units cannot adjust the vertical air flow but just sweeps the air side to side.  Another plus is that it's not as noisy as the other models that I've tried (Sharp claims 36DB in low fan mode). You don't have to turn the volume up to watch tv.  One thing that is missing is that the remote does not display the current room temperature.  
This item would get 5 stars if it were cheaper.  But even at $489.99 it's well worth it.

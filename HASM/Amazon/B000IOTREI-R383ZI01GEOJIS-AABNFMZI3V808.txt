Title: Okay
Content:
We bought this about a year ago and it still works like new. I honestly think that it is a little pricey for what you get, as it doesn't oscillate or change angles. If you sit/lay right in front of it, it really warms you up well, but isn't good at warming even a small room. It only warms what is directly in its path. Overall, though, if you just want it on you while you sleep or relax, it works.

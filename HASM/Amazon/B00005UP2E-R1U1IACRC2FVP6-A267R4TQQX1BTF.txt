Title: Best vacuum ever!
Content:
This is a wonderful little machine - extremely lightweight and easy to maneuver but with AMAZING suction power! It also has a feature to quickly and easily lessen that power with a quick flip of a small tab to easily vacuum blinds and curtains.  Lots of great attachments.  I absolutely love this little vacuum cleaner.  Plus the filter makes it easy to quickly empty and you don't have to mess with bags.  I love it!  I give it 2 thumbs up!

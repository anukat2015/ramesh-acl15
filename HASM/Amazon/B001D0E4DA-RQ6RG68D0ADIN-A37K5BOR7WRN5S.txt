Title: Archos 5 Internet Tablet - Amazing
Content:
I am one of those who can hang on to one product just for the love of it. I've got an I-mate Jasjar which has being serving me like a second brain and did not want to let it go for anything. The trouble I had was storage. Persuaded by a friend about this Archos 5 devices I got one of Amazon and it came just as promised, was still really not convienced of the product as compared to my Jasjar.But just as I open the box and started exploring the Archos 5 Internet Tablet,I found it an amazing product and wished I had it 10 years ago for half of my brain would have being in it as back up.The 250GB space relieved me alot. besides, the fast and enduring connectivity to the  internet make me enjoy my BBC programs, country music ,VOC programs etc. It is really lovely. I only hope there could be free add-ons to complement each purchase so one can enjoy all features as a package. It is a lovely product.

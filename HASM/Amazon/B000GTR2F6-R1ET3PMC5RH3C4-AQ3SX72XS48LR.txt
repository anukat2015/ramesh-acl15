Title: Great customer service!!!!
Content:
When I went to "prime" the maker prior to its initial use, I could not get the "add water" light to stop blinking.  I kept messing with the water resevoir and after a half an hour, called keurig's customer service.  The intial person was puzzled so she transferred me to the "tech" person who asked me to empty the water out of the resevoir and "shake it briskly", so I did.  She could tell by the lack of noise (over the phone mind you), that a round disk was not in the resevoir as it should be.  i told her I had the disk but it was not in the resevoir.  I placed it and secured it as best I could but she could tell that the bracket to hold it in place was not functioning properly.  I rigged it well enough to get it to work fine.  It makes great coffee by the way.  But the customer service rep. was not satisfied and shipped me a new resevoir over night so that "I could be sure to have coffee for the weekend".  Now that is customer service!  If only the rest of life could be that easy.....

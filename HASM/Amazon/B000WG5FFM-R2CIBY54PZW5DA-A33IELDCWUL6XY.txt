Title: C'mon, give the Zune a try
Content:
I have been exposed to iPods and Zens, and a few other mp3 players, but I REALLY love my Zune.  Plenty of space for all the music I am interested in listening to on an 8 GB Zune.  The interface is great, I can listen to mp3s at 320 kbps (nearly "lossless"), and still fit a few videos on or a movie (the screen is a bit small for 16:9, but fine to watch HD). The software is much easier to navigate than iTunes, and I prefer to get my music via Amazon, anyway.  I may upgrade to a 120 GB version sometime soon, so I can keep a small library of movies on for my commute.
Conveniently small, quick to set up and easy to change as you need. Believe me, I have an iPhone and I prefer to use this for music.  And you can't beat the quality for the current price.
Leave the herd and get yourself a Zune.

Title: It delivers on its promises! Awesome machine
Content:
What a superb machine this is.  It delivers on its promises!  We admit to being well traveled coffee aficionados, who grind our own coffee, and appreciate a fine machine that creates the coffee one will find in France, Italy, Greece as well as the best food cities here in the states (NYC, New Orleans, Seattle, San Francisco, Miami).  And what a versatile and easy to use machine this is and for the price a real gem.We like the black colour as well as the ease of use.  The water container lifts out so easily for filling with easy to read measuring levels in large print.  The buttons are elegantly designed and labeled for easy reading even in poor light or when not quit awake in the wee hours of the morning.  Which is handy when one has odd hours.  The carafe is beautiful and looks classy enough for ones dining table.  The only suggestion I have is buy a second carafe so that one pot can be brewing as the other is being used.  This is a machine we will also be giving as a gift. And talk about a machine that makes an awesome Espresso or Cappuccino. WOW !

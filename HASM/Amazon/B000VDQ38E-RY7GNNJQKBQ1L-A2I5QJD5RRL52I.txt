Title: My cleaning person likes it.
Content:
At first my cleaner did not like it because the pink hair catcher did not allow the collected hair to go into the catcher. Hair just collected and fell off again. Then, I read the directions and the hair catcher was not for bare floors. We flipped it up and now she says this is a very good vacuum and it even cleans the corners. We have laminate flooring and pets.

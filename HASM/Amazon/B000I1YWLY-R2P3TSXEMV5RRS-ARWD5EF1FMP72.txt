Title: Far Superior to Dyson
Content:
When we opened this vacuum and ran it over the carpet just cleaned by our Dyson - we were absolutely amased at what the Electrolux picked up!  We had to empty it several times going over the same area as the Dyson.
The machine is a pleasure to use. It is as advertised - not like the old Dyson which was so poorly designed you almost can't use the wand.  The engineers at Dyson took the day off when the wand was designed! And for the high cost of the Dyson - no head light - guess they did not want us to see how badly it was doing cleaning the carpet.
I highly recommend the Electrolux for it's ability to Clean, manuver, use the wand with accesories.

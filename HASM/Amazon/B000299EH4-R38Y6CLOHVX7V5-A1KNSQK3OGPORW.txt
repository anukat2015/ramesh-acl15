Title: Excellent product, until...
Content:
Now granted, I don't have the 4 gb model, I have the 1.5, but as far as I can tell the only difference is the size of the HD inside.  Everything written positive about the MuVo2 here is true, its easy to use, sounds great, charges well, etc etc.  
  I've been using mine constantly since January 04, well now in July 04 my MuVo has quit on me.  The headphone jack doesn't work anymore, and no it's not the pair of headphones, I've tried several.  I have treated the unit with the utmost care, never once dropping or banging it on anything, therefore creative is at fault.  Also tried cleaning the jack out with a very small q-tip and needle, no luck.  Creative only offers a 90 day warranty, so I'm in the market for a new mp3 player now.  I've always liked creative but I don't think I'm going to go with the 4gb model after what happened with my current one.  At least I can still use it as a flash drive...

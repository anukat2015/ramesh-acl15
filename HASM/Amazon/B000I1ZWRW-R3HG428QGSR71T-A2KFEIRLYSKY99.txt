Title: Canon Support is not worth it
Content:
I purchased a camera from Canon and 2 months later mirror locks up, nothing works, my daughter is in Hong Kong on a once in a life time trip.  There is a Canon Center in Hong Kong but this is a US warranty, they can not even talk to each other. Canon is not Worldwide as it claims on their web site.  I will never buy another canon.

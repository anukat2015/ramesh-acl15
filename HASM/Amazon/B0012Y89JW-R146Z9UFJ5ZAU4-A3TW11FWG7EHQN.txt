Title: Excellent Entry-Level Camera...Almost an Amateur Level Camera
Content:
I don't have a lot to say...I had the Canon EOS Rebel XTi. I then saw the XSi was coming out...did my research on it. Found out that it had what I needed for most of my amateur needs. It came out, I bought it. It didn't disappoint me. Bottom line.

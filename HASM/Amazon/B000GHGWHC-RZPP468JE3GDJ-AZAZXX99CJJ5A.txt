Title: Good little vacuum
Content:
This is a nice vacuum, has really good power and an attachment for small spaces. The attachment has a point to it which helps clean the nooks and crannies of my car (but not 100%). I use this in the house nearly everyday to clean up from the cat. The downsides are that you have to hold down the "on" button as you use it and if you are not using the attachment piece, there is no where to attach it to the vacuum. Otherwise it's a good vacuum, and a good price. Holds onto its power longer than the previous one I had. 
Updated 1/12/10 - I have to say in the beginning, this had lots of power. Now, in the first minute or two of vacuuming out my car that isn't even that dirty, I can hear the "whirring" sound start to die down...not sure why since it's on the charger 24 hours/day and the inside is cleaned out regularly. I can usually get through vacuuming up a small amount of light dirt in the front seat. My suggestion is to take the car mats out and shake the dirt off - save the vacuum power for the little spaces!

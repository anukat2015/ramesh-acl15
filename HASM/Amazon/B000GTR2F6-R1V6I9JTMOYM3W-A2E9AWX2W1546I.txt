Title: Top notch customer service from Keurig
Content:
We have loved our Keurig, it is super easy to use and the coffee is delicious.  We are saving money making our own rather than getting it from Starbucks.   I find that the extra bold K-cups work well for me to get the really strong espresso flavor.  Try different types until you get one you like.
I am giving this machine 4 stars despite some problems it has had.  This is because each time we have received flawless customer service from Keurig, surpassing our expectations.  I mean immediate and courteous response, whether on the phone or email, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate action taken (including a replacement machine).  Excellent communication every step of the way.  It is not often that a company's customer service can get such rave reviews!

Title: This vacuum is @sskickity for pet hair removal
Content:
I love this vacuum. My only complaint is that the tube for the attachments can be a little hard to remove from the machine. For the price though, it is a great purchase. I had actually borrowed a friends $500 Dyson to vacuum up the pet hair from my carpet and it did a pretty good job but a week later, when I vacuumed for the first time with this Bissell I was disgusted by the amount of hair etc. that this little bad boy picked up. I had to clean out the canister after I finished my living room. I had gone a longer period of time between vacuums when I vacuumed with the dyson and it didn't pick up half as much. I can actually put my eye down to my carpet and not see any hair. I don't think I've ever been able to say that with any other vacuum.
If you have carpet and have dogs, this vacuum is for you. However, if you don't make sure and clean out the the bagless canister when it's full all the time and the machine starts losing suction that's your own fault.

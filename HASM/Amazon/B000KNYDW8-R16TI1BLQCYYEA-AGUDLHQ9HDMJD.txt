Title: Sure it's loud, however...
Content:
I bought this AC this past week, to replace an underpowered (for the room I had it in) 5000 BTU unit.  I knew from reviews I had read online that this AC was loud, and they aren't kidding.  For that loudness however, the cooling output once it's been on for a good 5-10 minutes is obscene.  I'm nearly shivering and I'm about 4' away from the vent.  Some folks will be turned off by how loud it is, but for the most part if you don't care about noise and this fits your budget, it works fine.  Not sure what folks are talking about with it being the wrong kind of AC in the box, but mine is perfectly matched and performs as expected.  The thermostat on the AC unit itself is a little off, but then again when you're pumping this much air out, I'd expect you to be a little biased.  :) 
Yes, I will have to turn it off to use the phone and it'll probably be a little loud on those first few nights where I need it on, but when it comes down to it, I knew what I was getting into, so I have no room to whine.  Read the reviews, and judge the AC based on your needs.  If noise isn't a factor for you here, then by all means, get this AC and save a few bucks. 
On low it's noisy, medium it's a bit more like a vacuum, and on high, you're probably too hot to care how loud it sounds.  The fan functions are nice to have, and I do like how the unit itself will report the local temperature. I can compare it to my atomic wall clock / thermometer and set it accordingly.  
When you have a budget, you have to buy what you can get.

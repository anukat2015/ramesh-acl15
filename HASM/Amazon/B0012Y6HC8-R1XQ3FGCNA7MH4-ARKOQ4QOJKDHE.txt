Title: Error 99
Content:
I am a semi-pro and bought the XSi for light weight and high pixel count, as well as advanced picture processing.  I absolutely loved it--for a while.
11 months after buying it, while on a shoot, I got Err99 (a well-known error message that completely blocks any further shooting).  Camera completely shut down.
A little research uncovered the fact that Canon has a problem that involves several models and the company is not coming clean on the issue.
I would advise photographers NOT to buy Canon products until Canon tells the truth about this defect and addresses it.
For the record I was using a pro-Canon "L" lens when it happened.  Google "err99" and see how prevalent this problem is and how many models suffer from it.  It appears to be a design defect.
Forewarned is forearmed.

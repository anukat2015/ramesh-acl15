Title: So good I bought another one.
Content:
I bought this heater for our RV,(34 ft. Class A with slide-outs) and it works very well. I like the remote and the thermostat features. When we went to visit my daughter they needed a space heater for my new grandson's room so I loaned them the one out of our RV, they love it so I bought another one for my grandson. The tip over shut off and the fact that the heat elements aren't exposed make it a safe.

Title: A bit messy
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for about 5 months now and I really like the quality of the coffee as well as the look of it.  Guests always comment on how nice it looks and how easy it is to use!  However, I have found that if I am at all sloppy about pouring the water in, it seeps through and comes out the bottom near the cup holder.  And even when I think I am careful, there always seems to be some wetness under the coffee maker.  This means that every day I have to pick up the machine and move it to clean under it.  
But since I like the coffee and the design, and the fact that I paid $100+ for it, I will keep using it.  I looked at pod-type machines but figured I drink too much coffee to justify the cost of the pods alone.

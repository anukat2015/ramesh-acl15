Title: Pinguino PAC 03U Failure
Content:
Last September 2005 my Mother and brother spent a considerable amount of money purchasing the alleged state-of-the-art current DeLonghi Pinguino PAC 03U portable 7500 BTU air conditioner as a gift for us during a S. CA heat wave. Ironically, we only needed it one day before the weather cooled off during which the unit cooled nicely and worked fine. We carefully emptied it and stored the air conditioner upright until July 2006. We just reconnected it during the current heat wave here in Altadena, CA. We turned in on at night when the outside temperature was 89 degrees. The unit put out tepid air no matter how we started and ran the unit or where we set the fan and thermostat. We followed all "troubleshooting" instructions and find ourselves left with a large white plastic doorstop. It is sweltering today (over 109 degrees out) and we have no air conditioning. The tech support line isn't open on weekends, of course, and is only open Eastern time on weekdays. My family spent a lot of hard earned dollars on the Pinguino and it has lost coolant or failed for some other reason after one use and benign storage! Worse, a search can't even find our model number (Pinguino PAC 03U). It's like it never existed. We are not happy customers and hope to get some sort of compensation from Pingunio, IF we can reach someone about this model. Good luck in staying cool if you've bought one of these things.

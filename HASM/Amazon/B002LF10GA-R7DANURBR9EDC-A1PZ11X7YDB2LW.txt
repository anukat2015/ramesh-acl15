Title: Best "netbook" I've used so far
Content:
This computer is the best mini computer I've used to date in terms of features and price.  Its well equipped right out of the best, the screen resolution is key - many small computers do not have 1368 resolution - it makes all the difference.  The processor is fast, the LED display is great its Energy Star rated.  I am very happy.  I was skeptical about Acer in terms of quality but I've owned the Dell Mini and the Toshiba Nb205 and this computer blows them away - no comparison really its exactly what I was looking for.  Battery life is pretty good, not as good as the Toshiba but not bad I'd say about 4 hours of normal use which isn't bad at all.  The key board is also great no issues there.  Trackpad takes some getting used to but for all the other benefits I am willing to give that a pass.  For the money (and thats they key) this is the best mini computer I've used.  Also - you get a free Windows 7 upgrade - just go to the Windows site, click Acer and follow instructions - that was a nice bonus that wasn't mentioned.

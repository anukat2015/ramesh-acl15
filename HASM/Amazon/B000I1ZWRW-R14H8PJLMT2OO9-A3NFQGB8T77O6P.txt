Title: Great Camera
Content:
All though I did not buy this camera online (I bought it at a retail store) I had to be talked into buying it and not a Sony.  I was a beliver in Sony and still am but this camera was the exception.  It was so simple to use and it takes great pictures.  I am soooo glad that I purchased it.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to step up from a point and shoot.

Title: too hot for children
Content:
I was so excited when I got my eco-heater and after plugging it in I was very dissapointed. The surface gets way too hot -- too hot to be around children. I will mount it below my desk to get some extra heat in my office and where the kids don't have access. I wanted it for the living room -- my kids are young and curious and if they touch this for any length of time they will get burned. I do not recommend these for homes with curious children.

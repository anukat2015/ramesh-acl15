Title: Exactly what I wanted
Content:
I use heater fans for my studio apt and I love them. My current one sound like it is on it's last leg and when I saw this one on sale I decided to buy it. Even though it is summer I still had to test it. I love the remote and the fact that is oscillates. It has nice design and the earth tone blends in with my living room. The box that it was shipped in was in perfect shape but the box the item was in, was a little beat up. I did not see any creaks, breakage, or chips. I can't wait to use in the winter. I think my guest will be impress. This is an unusual design.

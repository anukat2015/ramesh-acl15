Title: Makes Great Coffee, BUT...
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker because it is rated #1 by Consumer Reports. I am a very satisfied with the taste of the coffee it brews. However, I do have a few minor complaints. First, the coffee isn't as hot as I'm used to. It's not that I expect the coffee to burn my tongue, I just want it to be a little hotter. Second, the timer only goes for 2 hours, so after 2 hours it automatically shuts off and I'm left with cold coffee. Third. it doesn't signal you when the coffee is finished brewing. Maybe I'm spoiled by my old Braun coffeemaker which had a 4 hour timer and beeped 4 times when the coffee was finished brewing. Lastly, the water doesn't always all brew out of the reservoir, so when I open the cover to remove the grounds, some water spills on my countertop. Overall, because of the great pot of coffee it brews, plus the great price I paid, I do recommend this coffeemaker.UPDATE...After approximately 3 months of use, the coffeemaker became EXTREMELY LOUD and made popping noises. Black and Decker sent me a replacement coffeemaker for free, BUT it wasn't this model. I'm guessing that there's a recall in the future for this coffeemaker, so I can no longer recommend you buy it. The replacement I received, model # BCM1410B brews good coffee, but it's cord is too short (I needed an extension cord), and it's display is not lit well.

Title: great computer
Content:
This computer has a lot of great features, most of which I've not even begun to use.  The picture is crystal clear, however the screen is very reflective.  I haven't used it outside yet, but I know it may not work for me.  Other than that, I've had no issues with Vista and I really enjoy the convenience of the fingerprint user.  I'm not a tech-person, so can't tell you why, but the speed of the computer is fantastic.  Overall, it was a great buy!

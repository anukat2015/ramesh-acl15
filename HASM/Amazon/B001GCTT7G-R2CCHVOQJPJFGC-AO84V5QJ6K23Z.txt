Title: Many pluses, but more minuses
Content:
The uni-body design of the new MacBook is gorgeous and the black keys go back to the unique style of the old Titanium PowerBook.  However, the screen quality is clearly inferior to the Pro version and the lack of matte option is a shame.
There are indeed many pluses going for this new iteration of the MacBook.  Unfortunately however, there are far more minuses.  Already mentioned is the noticeably inferior screen (this a a major flaw as the screen is the primary interface to the computer as it is through this that you will be look at all the time).  The purposeful omission of the FW port is just plain stupid.  This severely cripples the versatility of the Mac.  The price, another major factor, is just ridiculous.
Stay away from this version and buy the next one when Apple brings FW back as well as a decent screen with a matte option.

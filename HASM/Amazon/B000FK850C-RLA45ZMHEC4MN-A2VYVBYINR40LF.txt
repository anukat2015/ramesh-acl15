Title: LCD problems
Content:
When it worked it put out a lot of heat. Not sure the room temperature reading was accurate. LCD went bad after 3 weeks. Bad LCD started after putting the heater on oscillation. LCD should have reset itself after being unplugged but never did. Manufacture is sending a new one without much hassle. 60 day full replacement warranty!

Title: great item for the price, but bad battery life
Content:
For $35, I introduce to you the Zen Stone (Red) by Creative. It holds 1 gigabyte of music, or roughly 250 MP3 files from your computer, and is probably a total of like 3.5 inches big. Its also weighs less than a pound, and comes with a shuffle - repeat - or normal play button which I thought was cool. Additionally, it comes with a small white USB cable to transfer your songs to-and-from computers, and ON TOP OF THAT they included a pair of pretty decent quality headphones that are the type that go into your ear.
I have two complaints with this product. Like many have said, it's battery life is pretty bad. Creative claims that this thing can last up to about 6 to 8 hours, but in reality it lasts about 3 or 4 hours which is kind of annoying, but kind of acceptable seeing what the cost was and how much this thing can hold. Another slightly irritating flaw I found is the lack of any kind of screen indicating what song you are listening to. Now I know many of you are going to say, "but Sean, you put the songs on it, you should know what you are listening to" and that is entirely true.. but I listen to some underground music that I don't remember the names and if I come across a song that I really dig but don't know the name then when I get home its going to take me hours to sort through all my music and find it. 
This little gadget is ideal for those on a budget, enjoy running, working out, those on a really long car ride, or some people who like to steal some company time and listen to music while working lol. Its really easy to use, real small, and honestly I believe it to be a good buy.

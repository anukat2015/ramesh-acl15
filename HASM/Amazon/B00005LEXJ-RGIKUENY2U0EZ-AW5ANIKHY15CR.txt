Title: Be careful it gets really hot
Content:
Works great for taking the chill out of the shop. My shop is a Tuff Shed 8' x 20' and this little guy heats it up quick. I use it to take the chill out and then turn it off and use an electric heater to stay nice and warm. I'am to concerned about burning up all the good air to keep it on in the shop. In the open garage it is great for keeping the guys warm when they drop over for a cold beer or cocktail during the winter months. Camping - it is great when you step out before the sun is up to warm the day. Amazon beat all the prices I found for this item. I waited for the price to drop before buying though. It pays to be patient when you are looking for an item that is seasonal.

Title: Quite happy and cool
Content:
Had this air conditioner all summer long and slept like a baby.  Granted it took a couple nights to get used to the sound because it is loud and the volume jumps when the compressor kicks in.  That being said, it's a great unit that keep our bedroom crispy cool.  The auto evaporation feature is a nice bonus too.

Title: Reliable but bulky
Content:
I had some problems keeping the O ring from twisting in the center of the casing. At times, I did find water inside the casing and the mp3 player stopped working. Fortunately, it dried out and was able to work again which makes it somewhat reliable. I suggest applying vaseline to the outside of the casing to help seal the O ring and make it more waterproof. The earplug attachment to the casing works well and there is no need to do more than just push it in (unlike nu-dolphin where you have to screw in the earplugs.)
There is a poblem while swimming as the earplug cord tends to twist around my neck and the casing is bulky to wear. The music is easy to transfer in mp3 format. For the price, this is a great way to start out and you can use this for water aerobics!

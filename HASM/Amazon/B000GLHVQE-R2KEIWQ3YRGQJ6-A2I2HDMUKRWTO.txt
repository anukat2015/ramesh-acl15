Title: Beware! Watch the cord!
Content:
We received this item as a gift from our son for the holidays. Has worked decently for the past month, keeping the living room warm, but as noted with another customer, the electral cord just started to melt and has done damage to the electrical wall outlet. The cord was always a little warm when we unplugged it, but we just thought that was normal. Now that it has actually scortched the outlet and the plug itself has melted, I'm not planning on using it again.
A little extra comfort is not worth burning the house down for.

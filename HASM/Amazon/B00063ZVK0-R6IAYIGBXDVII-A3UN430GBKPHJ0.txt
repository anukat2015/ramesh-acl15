Title: Great for large room basements
Content:
I bought two of these to heat my 600 sq ft basement (unheated till now.) These units are a bit smaller than first thought, but worked very well. First time I plugged them in, my basement was 58 degrees. I set them on high and within minutes had to take my sweater off. Less than an hour later my whole room was 68 degrees and comfortable. Whisper quiet and cool to the touch, just as advertised.

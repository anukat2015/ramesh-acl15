Title: I agree with Jill Rosenberg
Content:
If you enjoy rather thin, weak coffee, this is the machine for you.
To brew a robust cup of coffee with my new Bunn, I find I must grind my beans extremely fine and use double the amount I used in my old Cuisinart.
This gizmo will become a gift for my sister-in-law who prefers translucent coffee, quickly brewed. I'm buying another Cuisinart.

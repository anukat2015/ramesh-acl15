Title: Utilitarian coffee
Content:
Dark-roasted drip coffees, as served by coffee shops such as Starbuck's and Peet's, generally use flat-bottom filtered machines that brew high volumes of coffee quickly, and at a high temperature.  This requires a pre-heated tank, a large basket, and deep (and preferably sturdier) filters to handle the high volumes of coffee and water.  There are no substitutes for these requirements.  A machine with a cone filter will not overcome the difference in flavor that heat, volume, and speed make.  
Bunn manufactures a perfectly servicable machine; there are no bells and whistles, which likely accounts for its poor performance on Consumer Reports.  The NHBX is not a particularly attractive machine to have on the counter, but the quality of its construction is superb, and it is capable of making a cup of coffee unsurpassed by anything short of a plunger or vacuum pot.
To reiterate some points made by other reviewers:
1. Use Bunn filters.
2. Use the recommended water to coffee ratio.
3. Pay close attention to your grind - a grind slightly more coarse than what you would typically use for a flat-bottom filter is what I go with.
4. Always grind your coffee right before you use it - not the night before!
5. Invest in a burr grinder if you don't have one already.  It makes a huge difference.

This is my first laptop so the whole Laptop thing is new to me. When it arrived via skybox to trinidad, it was well protected so came undamaged considering the distance it travelled. You have to make your own back-up DVDs, then move around the masses of junk on the hard drive to remove what you don't want. 320GB is really 286GB. A case is also not provided. The feel of the keyboard is great though. Battery life is max 2 hours not the upto 4 hours as stated. HDMI does not have a port. Overall, its well worth the money,a very stylish, powerful, sexy machine with everything I was looking for in a Laptop. Can't wait to show it off when travelling.

Title: Unless you are a sport journalist, you can't go wrong with this camera.
Content:
The Nikon D50 is my fourth digital camera, and my first SLR camera. I don't know why I didn't try SLR earlier, but now I have decided that I will never go back to non-SLR cameras (well, I still have my other 3 point and shoot digital cameras which sometime is more convenient to carry.) I guess I'm just trying to show how much I like the SLR camera. 
Now back about the D50. Unless you are shooting sports/actions professionaly (which then you will want to buy the D2H or D2X for faster focusing processor, faster frames per second and larger memory buffer), the D50 is pretty much all you will need (equipped with several lenses of course). 
The D50 has all the pre-configured settings for the casual photographers ("child" mode is also added for the D50, night landscape mode is not available), and it has the usual P,S,A,M mode for the more serious/advance photographer. I have stopped using the pre-set mode now and strictly uses the aperture priority and the shutter priority mode (as far as the manual mode, I'm not there yet). This shows that this camera is versatile and suitable for all ranges of skills. 
Comparing with its siblings (D70s, D80, D200), I think whichever you want to buy is fine. They are all great cameras. It comes down to your budget. And comparing to other brand like the canon (Rebel XT or the 30D),or pentax or sony, it will be just brand preference (and what lenses that you already have). Moreover, If you come from a point and shoot camera user, any SLR brand you buy I don't think you will be dissapointed (just the fact that SLR performs better in most important aspect of photography) 
Image quality of the D50 is good which is #1 factor that I look for in a digital camera. 
Here are the pros and cons of the D50 in my opinion: 
Pros: 
1. Nice out of the camera result picture quality (on Auto setting, and pre-programmed setting) 
2. Fit perfectly on my hand (grip nicely) 
3. Instant on and can take picture right away 
4. 2.5 frames per second 
5. large 2 inch LCD 
6. Battery life (will take 400-2000 shots on a single charge depend on how often you use the full power flash) 
7. Uses SD card 
8. Fast USB2 connection 
9. capability to copy and re-size pictures to small size (great for email) 
10. repeating #1 again. Great image quality 
Cons (which are mostly minor): 
1. No backlight on top panel 
2. No Black and White picture mode 
3. No night landscape mode 
4. No ISO 100 (and on ISO 1600 the picture is grainy though still usable)
5. No depth-of-field preview button 
6. No front command dial 
7. 1/4000 max shutter speed 
I started using this camera for landscape and portrait, but later on I started shooting sports/action and night (low light) settings, hence I added the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 AF-D which is a great prime lens and I'm recommending to everyone to get this "fast" lens. I'm also recommending you to get the Nikon 70-300M f/4-5.6 AF G, which is a nice (for the price) zoom lens. If you have the budget then go for the Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 VR AF-S which I think the best zoom lens that nikon currently have. (The VR really works especially for stationary object. If the object you want to photograph is moving and in low light situation/indoor then you will need a "fast" lens, i.e. lens with large aperture such as f/2.8, f/1.8, or f/1.4 etc)
Happy Photographing!

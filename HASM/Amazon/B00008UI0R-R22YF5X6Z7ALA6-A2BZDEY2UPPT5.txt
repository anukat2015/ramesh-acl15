Title: Not for people with lots of long pet hair!!!!
Content:
I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel.  The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off!  The very first time I used it,  it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it.  I'm not sure if that's what made it come off,  but it's a pain to repair the belt.  Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off,  but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush.  We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.  
I also did not like the dirt cup. If you  have long haired dogs or cats,  the quantity of hair being sucked up  will fill the cup to the max line very quickly. 
Needless to say,  I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now.  On to Meile!!!

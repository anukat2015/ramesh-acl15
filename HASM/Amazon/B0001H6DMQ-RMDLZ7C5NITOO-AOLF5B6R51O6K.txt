Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
Love my vacuum...I have had it for over three years, and I use it every week. The only thing I wish is that it were more effective at picking up hair. I have long, long hair, and I have two cats. Hair gets tangled in the brush constantly. Apart from that, this vacuum is a breeze to use. Easy to clean the cup, and filter is lifelong! Love that I can wash all the removeable parts. Also easy to move around.

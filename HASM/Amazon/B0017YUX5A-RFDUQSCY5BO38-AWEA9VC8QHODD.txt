Title: Too much trouble
Content:
Vacuum only 6 months old and the extension wand will no longer shorten; this makes it difficult to vacuum stairs.  Not a good vacuum if you have pets. Small amount of dog hair causes bag full indicator light to constantly come on.   Hose not flexible; constantly crimps.  Would not buy a Hoover again.

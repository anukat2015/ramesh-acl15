Title: Excellent product for the price
Content:
I purchased this item in anticipation of a hot summer. Our computer room gets very hot during the summer. Tried a normal fan, but it was only pushing hot air around. 
Pros - good construction. LIke the drain plug on the bottom and the remote control. Though I'm still int he winter here in Las Vegas, I expect it well keep my computer room cooler by at least 5 degrees. Surpentin, company that makes the cooler, has excellent customer service. 
Cons - the coolers pump was moving water through the back mesh, thus not cooling. However, I email the company and they immediatly sent me back another cooler and paid for all return shipping. 
I would recommend this item if you have a small room that needs cooling. Any other cooler cost a lot more.

Title: I've Owned Nothing But Creative Products
Content:
The Good:
I've had the Vision: M since June of 2007 and it is EXTREMELY durable, I've dropped it more times than I can remember and it shows no ill effects.  I take it into the sauna with me after workouts at the gym, again no problems.  Sounds great, it has a customizable EQ feature, a "bass boost", and a "smart volume" so all your tracks will be the same level. (IE, so older tracks play at the same level as newer ones).
The not as good:
The older it gets, the quicker the battery drains (maybe that's with all mp3 players?).  You can't use just any USB cable to connect it to your computer, it comes with an adapter that you have to have to attach to the cable so if you lose it, you're screwed.  If you fill it up too close to the 30 GB limit it will start locking up on you. 
If you put video on it, it seems like even at full volume it's still a little lower than I would expect something at full volume to be.
Overall, this is certainly a good media player for the price.

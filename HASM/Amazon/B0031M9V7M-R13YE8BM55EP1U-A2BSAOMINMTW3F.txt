Title: Great budget thin and light laptop
Content:
This is a fantastic little machine that will blow you away when you see it in person.
Pros:
1. Extremely thin and light
2. No optical drive (to me, this is a pro, others not)
3. Easy to use, quiet keyboard
4. Amazing battery life
5. 4GB DDR3 RAM and expandable to 8GB
6. Windows 7
7. Minimal bloatware
8. Strong wifi reception (also, wifi-n)
9. HDMI Out
10. Nice touch pad with multi gesture and multi touch
Cons:
1. No bluetooth
2. Keyboard can feel a little 'plastic-y'
3. Speakers are a little weak
Overall, this laptop has really impressed me. If you are looking for that middle ground between netbooks and full fledged notebooks, this (or a similar Timeline model) is right for you.
The overall feel of the laptop is very impressive. The aluminum case makes the machine feel very sturdy while also being very light.
The keyboard is a pleasure to type on, even though sometimes it feels a little plastic-y and slightly flimsy.
Booting this machine up for the first time was also a pleasure. Windows 7 guides you through a few setup steps and you're set. It even helps you set up your initial wifi connection, which worked immediately.

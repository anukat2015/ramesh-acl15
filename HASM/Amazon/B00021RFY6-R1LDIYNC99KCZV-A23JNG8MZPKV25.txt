Title: Great coffee/BIG problems !
Content:
I've had my Grind and Brew Coffeemaker for a year and a half now.  While it makes superb coffee, I am fearful everytime I use it.  I went through the initial problems with the filter door popping open, but that was easily solved. NOW, for some reason, the coffee won't be sucked into the pot each and every time, so just when I begin to trust it again, BAM, hot coffee is all over my brand new maple hardwood flooring ( now WARPED where the coffee spilled onto it).  I have kept the parts clean; I run a special coffee maker cleaner through it once a month, but to no avail.  A coffee maker as expensive as this one should last much longer than 18 months.

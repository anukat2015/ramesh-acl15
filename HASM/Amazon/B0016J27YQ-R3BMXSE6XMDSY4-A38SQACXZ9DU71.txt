Title: It's a room cooler not an "air conditioner"
Content:
The NewAir AF-330 is a great buy if you need a room cooler. WARNING: If you are looking to cool a large area or the entire house this is not the unit to buy. 
It works great if you don't want to run the air conditioner for the entire house just to keep yourself cool in your bedroom while you sleep, or, if you have work to do in a particular room like an office. I have friends who own two-story condos and they complain about running the air all night just to cool their bedrooms on the top floor. This cooler is the perfect solution for them as well.
It holds a lot of water. I've been running this machine for 7 evenings in my bedroom from about 10pm until 6am and it still doesn't need more water added to it. The remote control is awesome. If I get chilly I don't have to get up to turn it off - I just reach over and use the remote. It also has a timer feature which is great because if you know that the house cools down at a certain time, say after 3am, you can program the NewAir AF-330 to automatically shut off after 1, 2, 4 or 8 hours. I wouldn't use this in the living room unless you plan to sit right in front of it but for a bedroom or small office it's perfect. It's on rollers so you can move it to whatever room you need to. 
The NewAir AF-330 is saving me money - swamp coolers are cheaper to run than regular air conditioners - and helping me to get a good night of sleep. I don't regret purchasing this unit at all.

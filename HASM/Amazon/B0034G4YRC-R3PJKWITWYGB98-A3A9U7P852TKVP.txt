Title: "Say Hello To My Little Friend"
Content:
This is my first laptop and I could not have picked a better one. I am impressed everytime I use it. Like others, I literally invested hours of research prior to selecting this one. For me, it came down to features for the money and the gorgeous looks of this machine. The HDMI out, larger hard drive capacity, faster DDR 3 memory,  and i5 processor made the difference for me. This Gateway is gorgeous to look at. It's piano black finish does attract dust and fingerprints do show easily but I knew that would be the case when I bought it, and it's really not a problem. The screen pops and is definitely eye candy! And as other's have said, it's very sturdy and has a quality look and feel. The barrel hinge is very sturdy and looks nice too. As an XP user, so far, Windows 7 has been a positive experience and easy to adapt too. The shortcut keys located at the top of the keyboard are also a nice feature unique to this laptop. I have a wireless mouse, but have found the touch pad so user friendly, that I felt comfortable right away and I now actually prefer it to my mouse. I did, however, need to change the settings for the touchpad to better suit my style. All in all, this is the best deal for my dollar and hopefully will continue to be a part of my family for the next several years. One more thing, I purchased the SquareTrade 3 year warranty for $99. Several days after I received the laptop, SquareTrade contacted me to be sure I had received the warranty they sent via e-mail, to thank me for purchasing it and to let me know they were there should I need them. WOW! Unheard of! For me, it is a good feeling to have the extra protection, should something go wrong.

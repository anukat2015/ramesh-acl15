Title: Works as intended with a few drawbacks
Content:
For the price this heater does what it is meant to do however there are a few drawbacks and some situational things that must be known before purchasing this portable surround heater. 
The good:
-It worked right out of the box with no assembly. 
-It will heat a small room well.
-Relatively quiet. 
-Small footprint
-Price
-Child resistant switches
-Begins heating instantly.
The bad:
- With all the warnings on the heater telling you to place the device at least three feet from anything combustible (like curtains or anything cloth), it would have been nice to have more than 5 feet of cord. You also are not recommended to use an extension cord so more length would make this more convenient. 
- Heater odor: One needs to get used to a faint smell of burning plastic. Its similar as someone else stated to turning on your car heater (however I feel the odor is stronger than that)
- The auto shutoff incase the device tips over is only applicable if it falls forward or backward, on its side it will still remain on. In addition, this is more of a problem for this device because it heats in a 360 degree range.
What to know:
Although it has a fan and honeywell claims that it is meant to dispense heat in 360 degrees, keep in mind that heat rises so while this is a "surround heater" there is no real direction with the fan. If you want a spot heater get a heat dish instead.
While it says this is energy efficient (they even claim more so than your home heating system), it is only the case if the device is set to the low setting. The low setting however is far too low for any heating purpose. I live in southern california and I still haven't used anything less than the high setting to make this heat my small bedroom. The low setting uses 600 watts, the medium setting 900 watts and the high setting uses 1500 watts of power. If energy consumption is a factor, keep all of this in mind.

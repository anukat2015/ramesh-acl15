Title: works so well I bought 2
Content:
got this to use in my baby's room almost 3 years ago, I use it to keep the room comfortable using either fan or heat.  Its so quite and I get really good results with regulating the room tempature.  I have no concerns about its saftey the cord is very sturdy and the plastic housing does not get hot.  I bought a second one for baby number 2's bedroom and have the same great results.

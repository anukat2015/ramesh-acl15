Title: The Little Canon That Can Do It All
Content:
I own more cameras than I care to mention. I bought the XTI because of its small footprint, and excellent megapixel numbers. I have not been disapointed at all. I love it. 16 X 20 prints that look super sharp are possible if you are using a good lens. It is my favorite travel camera now. I would highly reccommend this little machine for those who are moving up in the digi world from the point and shoot cameras. Compared to my Nikon D2x it is a feather weight, but still gives great performance. Toss it over your shoulder, and you won't even know it is there.

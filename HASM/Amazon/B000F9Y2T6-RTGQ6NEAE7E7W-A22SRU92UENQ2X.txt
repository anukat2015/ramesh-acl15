Title: Love, LOVE, LOVE IT!
Content:
This product is definitely worth the money. The first time I used it, I knew I would never go back to the old mop and bucket. It saved my back, time, and a whole lot of sweating. I have a NYC apartment that is all wood floors. With our extra many legged "tenants", I knew I wanted something that would really clean my floors so that I had piece of mind while my boys played on the floors. I was sooooo impressed with the amount of dirt and grime that this machine sucked up. All i can say is YAHOO! Buy it, you won't be sorry.

Title: I was skeptical, but now very impressed
Content:
I built my woodshop which is well insulated (R19 in walls, R40 in ceiling) and about 460 square feet with 8 foot ceilings.  Living in Iowa, I was skeptical whether this heater could do the job where it sometimes gets 10 to 20 below for several days in Dec and Jan.  Those fears were alleviated.
Edit as of 01-03-09.  The local news just advised that here in my area, it is the 9th coldest December since 1897 when they started keeping track.  They also said it is the second snowiest December on record.  There were several days below 0 and a couple to -20 ambient temp which is common in those months any Winter.  
If you are at all concerned that the heater can handle a level of cold that commonly reaches 33 below (wind chill) and -20 ambient temp, worry no more.  I kept the heater on the third mark out of 10 and it maintained between 49 and 53 depending on the coldness of the night.  When I went out to work, I turned it up to a tad beyond LOW and it leveled at 60 degrees.  It's also very quiet in that I'm able to have a normal voice conversation with anyone present and we aren't really aware when it turns on.  Very nice not have the smell of fuel oil in the air.  I'm very happy with the purchase.

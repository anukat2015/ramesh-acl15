Title: Speed and Space...
Content:
Might be the best laptop under $500 you can buy. Great screen, bight and clear, sound is good enough and key board is light to the touch and comfortable.
Three gigs of ram, AMD dual core 2.0 GHz and 320 gig hard drive... Speed and space! OK, now the best part is the graphics, 256 gigs of dedicated system memory ... Windows Experience index - Desktop performance for Windows Areo is 4.0 and 3D business and gaming graphics is 4.3... Better than my desktop.
Windows Experience index
Processor - 4.8 
Memory / Ram - 5.8
Desktop - Windows Areo - 4.0
3D Graphics - 4.3
Hard Disk - 5.3
Web cam is clear and sharp, works great with skype... And wireless is b,g,and n.
I couldn't be more happy with my purchase.
Update - Just got the Caselogic VLS-114 14.1-Inch Laptop Sleeve from Amazon today... The Acer fits great, has padding and is canvas like for protection and not much of increase in overall size.

Title: Got what I wanted
Content:
Sony VAIO VGN-AW230J/B 18.4-Inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 Processor, 4 GB RAM, 500 GB Hard Drive, Blu-ray Drive, Vista Premium) Black
I use it for gaming and surfing and watching movies.
It is better than I expected.  I also got it in three days, after I was told it would take a month to deliver. 
High res extreme color graphics in WOW. 
Still getting used to surfing potential.
Brilliant screen even in daylight!
Glad I got it.

Title: beware of multi-touch mousepad
Content:
It is the perfect size and fast speeds. I like Win7 as the chances of getting virus and other bad stuff is very low due to security features added by MS in Win7 OS.
It's multi-touch pad is the worst and very inconvenient. For pressing Lt and Rt clk, you have to press very hard.
After trying to use for 5-6 days, I am unable to get used to it and am now using a mouse with it.
I would highly recommend to try the multi-touch pad before buying this laptop.
Except that...everything else is good about this laptop including the price.

Title: Quality issues but love the coffee
Content:
I'm really sorry to have to give this machine only 1 star, because the coffee tastes great, when the machine works.  Unfortunately, they are clearly having serious quality problems.  I am on my third machine, and it will be going back on Monday.  On the last one, the handle came right off.  They sent me a replacement, and it doesn't work at all (the water doesn't come out).  I really hope I eventually get one that works.  This one is going back on Monday, and I'll have to wait another 3 weeks for the next replacement.  It's been very frustrating.  But when the machine works, it's great.  I wish they made decaf, nonfat latte capsules though.

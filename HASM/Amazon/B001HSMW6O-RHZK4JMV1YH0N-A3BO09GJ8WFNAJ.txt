Title: JUst Don't Trust Me
Content:
This is the most ill conceived product I have EVER seen. After 4 hours of labor, I don't even care if it works. It did not! There were not any nuts pressed into the unit for the screws to screw into. Oh and the mounting instructions. Give me a break, by the time I got it to fit my cabinet looked like cottage cheese. The template is not even close. Going back and I am fuming................. that BD would even try to pull this one off. They lost me forever.

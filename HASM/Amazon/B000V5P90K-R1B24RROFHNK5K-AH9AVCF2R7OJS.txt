Title: well worth the money
Content:
had a rebel xti previously and i thought rebel gives me very nice photos but when i experienced the 40d i just can't believe how much clearer and better the results.  i really like the size too, i have a big hand and now i got a good grip of the camera unlike with rebel half of my palm is like hanging.  also the camera has some nice extra features like you can put it on high iso and it has built in noise reduction which you can turn on and off. really nice if you're not into flash photography.  there's a lot more nice features in it, i have to say it's really worth the money.

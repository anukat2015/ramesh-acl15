Title: perfect for basement apartments!
Content:
I live in a basement apartment in Washington DC.  The winters here get pretty cold and I do not have control of the heater.  The landlord upstairs controls the heat (and they are rarely home).
I plugged this heater into my front room.  The room measures 20x25'.  The temperature gage intially read 58 degrees!  Wow that's cold.  I set the digital temperature gage to 72 degrees.  It initially took about an hour to reach that temperature (I think the electronics needed to be broken in).
This little heater has been plugged in and running nonstop, 24 hours a day, for the past three weeks and it is nothing short of spectacular!
I positioned the heater at one corner of the apartment and it heats the entire room and keeps every corner of the room at the same temperature.
Since it has a plastic casing, it is constantly cool-to-the-touch and I have no reservation with leaving it on when I leave in the morning to go to work.  The unit *never* gets hot.
I thought $100 was a bit expensive for a heater, but wow... this purchase has been justified.
I also have a humidifier (by Bionaire) running on a 24-hour basis to prevent the room from becoming too dry.
The temperature gage on the heater is spectacular.  You really can tell the difference between 70 and 72 degrees with this heater.
It's fabulous.  Nothing short of fabulous.

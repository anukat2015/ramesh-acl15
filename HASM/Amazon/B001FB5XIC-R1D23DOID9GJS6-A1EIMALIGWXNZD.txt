Title: plastic smells bad
Content:
pros: remote control, can rotate
cons: not quiet enough, you start to smell the odor from its plastic surface when it get heated; the tilt-prevenation mechnism over-reacting when the floor surface is rough sometime.
I returned this product and bought an oil heater which we are very satisfied so far

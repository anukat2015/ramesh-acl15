Title: Good for small room...if you have time for it to warm up.
Content:
This heater works fine if you have a small room to heat and have a couple hours to wait for it to make a difference.  I should have done more research and learned what convection heating (like this one) is all about.  There is no warm air that blows from the heater unit, rather it just gets hot and the warm air rises from it.  If you are looking for faster and more directed heat...I suggest a heater with a built-in fan.

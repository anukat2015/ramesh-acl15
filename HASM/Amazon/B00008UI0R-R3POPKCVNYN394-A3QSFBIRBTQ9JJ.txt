Title: A junk !   Don't waste your money !
Content:
Purchased mine less than 2 years ago. It was quite good at first. But the troubles started after about 15 uses. The first trouble was On/Off switch and then overheating -------. This is my 3rd Hoover but is going to be my last.
It is a bloody shame that the corporate greed chose to produce them offshore 
and let a good name like "HOOVER" gone down to hell.

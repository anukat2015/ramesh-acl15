Title: Great little heater!
Content:
I bought this on the recommendation of friends.  I am not disappointed.  
It is lightweight, easily transported, and trouble free.  We have been using this to keep us warm while watching my daughter play soccer.  My daughter's school soccer season is during February and March, so we have some pretty cool afternoon and evening games (down in the low 30's last night!).  This definitely helps knock down the chill factor.  Everyone that sees it says, "Hey, I've gotta' get one of those"!  The only negative things I have noticed is that it can be difficult to light if it is breezy outdoors.  Also, it is sensitive to movement.  If it is slightly bumped or nudged it will turn off (which I'm sure is a safety feature).  I really can't make recommendations of how well it heats an indoor area, since we have been using it outdoors.  Although I'm sure it would do great in a hunting house, small cabin, or similar setting.  Overall, we're very happy with the purchase and would recommend it (and have done so to our friends).

Title: GREAT but have to order bare floor attachment, still great!
Content:
The floor attachment that comes with this is for carpets.  If you go to the Eureka site, go to accessories, you will see the floor attachment here is carpet.  You can order the bare floor attachment for $21 plus shipping though. Well worth it, it works better on bare floors (although you can get by with this one, not as good though). I HIGHLY recommend this unit, it is WAY-POWERFUL for the size, lightweight.  I disagree with some on here, for the money it's durable and well made. Two other attachments, a pointed crevice nozzle and a smaller brush-nozzle comes with it, also two bags.  The bags are actually larger than I thought.  I had used an Oreck carry canister for bare floors and this is TEN TIMES BETTER, MUCH more powerful, larger bag, many advantages.  Could not be happier.

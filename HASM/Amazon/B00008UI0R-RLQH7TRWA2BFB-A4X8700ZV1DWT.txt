Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
I have been using an upright for quite a few years and hated it.  We heat with wood stoves so I get a lot of wood chips on the floors as well as a lot of dust.  Since I have arthritic knees and had trouble pushing the upright I decided it was time to go with a cannister vacuum.  After doing some research on this one, I ordered it and vacuum at least 3x a week now.  I can't believe how much it picks up every time I vacuum.  I am now buying a second one for my daughter for Christmas.

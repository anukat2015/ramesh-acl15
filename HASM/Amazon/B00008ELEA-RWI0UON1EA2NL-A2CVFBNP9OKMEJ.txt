Title: Didn't last very long
Content:
I bought this coffee pot about a year ago and only used it occasionally.  The last time I tried to use it the part where you plug the cord into the base of the coffee pot collapsed, making the pot unusable.  I thought I was getting a quality coffee pot that would last for years, like my old Farberware percolator did, but apparently they are not made as well as they used to be.

Title: THE BUNN COFFEE MAKER IS A DISSAPOINTMENT
Content:
I had a difficult time trying to find a decent coffee maker that would actually give me a good tasting, hot cup of coffee. One would think that the Bunn unit would be the one, especially if you consider the fact that Bunn is the brand of coffee makers usually found in restaurants and coffee shops. I was very dissapointed with this particular unit and returned it after two days. I did not like the fact that you had to leave the switch on in the back reservoir of this unit, which is suppose to keep water hot for coffee. Not only is this a potential fire hazard to leave an appliance on 24-7, but once you brew a pot of coffee with the "hot" water from the reservoir, it does not stay hot and I found my coffee was tepid when I added milk to my cup of java. Another problem is that you cannot get a full pot because the water evaporates as it is constantly cooking and boiling away in the reservoir. If you want to brew two pots in a row, this will not work. The second pot of coffee will be weak and will be semi-hot, because the water in the reservoir has to be in there for a considerable amount of time to get heated up. I tried many different brands of coffee, all expensive, which should have given me a nice tasting coffee. However, I found every pot to have a bitter taste. This coffee maker is not what I expected at all. In the future I will pay attention to consumer reports before I purchase a coffee maker. And... if you read these reports, you will not find the Bunn coffee maker at the top of their list. Don't waste your time or money on the Bunn coffee maker, take my advice!

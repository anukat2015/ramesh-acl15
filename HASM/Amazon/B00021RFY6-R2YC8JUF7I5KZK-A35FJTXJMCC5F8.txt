Title: Damaged Goods

[[ASIN:B00021RFY6 Factory-Reconditioned Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew Coffeemaker, Brushed Chrome]This is the second "reconditioned" Grind and Brew Coffeemaker I've bought. The first one I bought at an outlet store and it was as good as a full-priced one. This recent purchase works fine, but was dented on the front. I guess I could have returned it but, for the price, decided to keep it. Bottom line - you get what you pay for. If you want a non-damaged product, pay full price. Had I known the product was dented, I would not have purchased it.

Title: Trying to decide on a hard drive based MP3 player? Then look no further than the Zune.
Content:
I immensely enjoy my Microsoft 30 GB Zune MP3 player. It is definitely much better than the iPod Nano that I used to have. Maybe it is because of the amount of songs I can fit on here, but it was cheaper than the current iPod nano's, so this is worth it. I saw a lot of complaints about the software, and while I did have some trouble with it, I just restarted my PC and I was good to go. I haven't encountered any problems since then. Navigating is easy for the player itself. My only complaints are:
The battery life which is way shorter than advertised
When I turn it back on after turning it off it starts all over again. I liked the nano in which I could turn it on and it would be in the middle of a song right where I stopped it, thus letting my shuffle continue going. 
But I would say if you want a relatively cheap MP3 player with lots of space, get this.

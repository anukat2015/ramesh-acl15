Title: Rock solid
Content:
I'm a low end user. Checking email, some wordprocessing, watching DVD's, downloading music and films... you get the idea.
First, this is an ugly machine, but I've come to love it. When I first pulled it out of the box it looked so cheap I was checking my invoice to see if it could be returned. Over the near three months I've had it, it has really grown on me. 
A reviewer stated that it's flimsy plastic. Hey buddy, I got news for you they're ALL plastic in this range, and this isn't flimsy at all. It does NOT flex when you pick it up like those faux, slick looking metallic ones that are magnets for fingerprints. And the raised texture surface pattern means no fingerprints. I've come to appreciate the ingenuity of this baby. It's like the people at Lenovo decided to do away with any pretenses of being attractive and focused on building a rock solid laptop, at a great price (I got mine at newegg for $400).
Being it's this basic, hardworking machine there are no frills. No DVI, no lighted keyboard, no fingerprint ID, no operational shortcut buttons for DVD/music playing. It's black, it has an on button (cheap looking), lights to tell you it's running and if you have the CAPS LOCK on. Surprisingly it has a webcam???
So if you're looking for a reasonably priced laptop for school or travel, you can't go wrong with this. It's fast and I work with multiple windows from multiple programs open and there's never a problem.

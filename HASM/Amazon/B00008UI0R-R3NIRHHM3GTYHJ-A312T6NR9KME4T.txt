Title: Vacuum Cleaner Review
Content:
I researched the best vacuum for laminate/hardwood floors and the Hoover S3765-040 was recommended best performance for the cost.  The recommendation was right on - I have been pleasantly surprised by the vacuum's performance.  Especially useful is the separate (yet easily interchangeable) hardwood floor attachment.    We have super-fine "sugar sand" on our property which makes its way into the house on a daily basis - usually attached to the paws of our 6 dogs.  The canister took a little getting used to - first time I've ever owned a canister style vacuum, but once I got the hang of it - not a problem at all.  This particular model even has a little mini-head attachment for furniture - very useful for dog hair and sand that is left behind on the couch.  I give this product top rating.

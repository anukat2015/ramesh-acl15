Title: No Noise - Works Well - Looks Great - Will Raise Your Electricity Bill
Content:
This DeLonghi HHP1500 is a great heater. I bought it during the Friday Sale on Amazon. I love how it runs without any sound. It works well in a bedroom when you need to your quiet at night. The heat distributes gradually - in a small bedroom, give it a 10-30 min headstart and it will warm up the room nicely. Its slick, flat design looks stylish, modern and will impress your guests. 
I've owned it for a few months and been happy with it. However, this "Mica Panel" radiator does raise your electricity cost just like any other heater. Mine's gone up considerably, from avg. $24 to $57 per month, so it's not as energy saving as I had hoped. Note the switch / dials on the side do not really mean much - I have the power on "1" which is supposed to draw 750W (the other setting "2" draws 1500W), and a heat level at "4" (moderate level) for most nights - Still my bill goes up a lot. 
If you don't mind the extra cost, which happens anyway in the winter months, this DeLonghi "Mica Panel" radiator will be a good addition to your place.

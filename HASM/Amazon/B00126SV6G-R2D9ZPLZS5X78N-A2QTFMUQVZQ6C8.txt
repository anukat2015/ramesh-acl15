Content:
I was in the market for a few weeks for just the right MP3 Player after looking online at reviews I decided on this one and let me tell you what a Piece of S_ _ _  this was! worked for about 5 mins then shut off the screen but the power remained on I drained the batt. in hopes that would work and nothing called Creative Labs and they came to the conclusion the this one was to be replaced got a new one upon taking it out of the box this one booted up to a white screen and then froze again called Creative and again replaced it this time I went back to store to exchange and the third one I charged over night like box said and the batt was still dead I returned after creative again said to replace and got my money back PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Title: P.O.S
Content:
The first one stopped working after eight months. I returned it and got a replacement which took nearly two months. The replacement battery started to die after two months. I was told I was out of luck because the "original" warranty was in effect in spite of getting a SECOND unit and that the original warranty ran out. Screw you RCA. I'll stick with Apple.

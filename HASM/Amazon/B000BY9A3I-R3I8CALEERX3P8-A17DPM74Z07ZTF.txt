Title: Bought too soon on Amazon
Content:
I truly love this vacum cleaner! It is the best one i've ever bought. I just hope it lasts for a long time. Others, (different makes and models), I have bought have only worked for a year or two. It cleans my hardwood floors very well, including next to the baseboards and in corners. My only disapointment is that Amazon now, a month later, has them on sale at 1/3 off.

Title: Great DSLR
Content:
I'm definitely a novice photographer.  I have had a Canon G3, which has been an awesome camera.  But the wear and tear over the years was taking its toll on it and I needed to replace it.  I decided I wanted a DSLR that I could use different lens' with.  When the XSi came out I read all the reviews and finally bought it as a Xmas present for myself.  This camera is great.  With 12MP the resolution is very nice to have when cropping your images.  Even with the kit lens the pictures are very good.  My next purchase is going to be a telephoto that I can use for my landscapes.  I highly recommend this camera.

Title: I love this machine!
Content:
I love this machine. Every year they are improved. I had a bad run with them. I must have had six or seven die on me. I sent them back to the company and they sent another one, no questions asked. I have seen an improvement. I guess I was the reason. I kept getting new ones. The last one lasted me over a year. Because I do not drink coffee it is used religiously. The new one I did purchase as I felt I got my moneys worth, and it is even quieter and more efficient than the last one. I know that having to send them back sounds like a lot of trouble but I knew that with each one the company would stand behind it. I figured as long as I sent them back (especially with them having a record of when I got it) they would either improve them or keep losing money on me. I figured right. They are better than ever.

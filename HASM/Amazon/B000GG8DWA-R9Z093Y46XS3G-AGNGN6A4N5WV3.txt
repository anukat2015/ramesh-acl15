Title: still have not decided whether to return it or not..
Content:
I am still undecisive about returning it though it is not a good heat source, all I need is a way for warmth in the bathroom at night after hours, not a primary heater for morning ruitines.  It does little more than burn your leg off and not produce ambiant heat and is quite a bit for just something to give you that "welcome to your throne" feel when you get out of bed dreading the task of jettisoning cargobay's 1&2 to the cosmic rift of freezing your bum off! 
*this heater will heat your pants off in one singular target area(do not put closer than three feet nor far away)
*this heater produces no(NO!) ambient heat at all(NONE!!!)
in a bathroom(like a half bath) it can be somewhat less a nuisence than no heat, as my bathrooms have no heat source at all(no ductwork routed from main centeral).  I ususally turn my prime heat down to 62 degreeds(ferinheit) by midnight when I sleep.  It can get pretty chilly in the pre-dawn hours. This thing produces a glow but for heat, it can only be somewhat more tollerable than none at all and will crisp your leg if you don't set it to a misfired angle to "graze" your hull.(star trek speak).

Title: Great burr grinder/brewer / Easy to use, easy to clean
Content:
We had a Cuisinart brind/brew that quit grinding beans after a month. We replaced it with another Cuisinart thinking bad luck on that machine. The second Cuisinart also broke.They had us send the whole unit back to where we bought it for replacement!
 We then saw and ordered the Capresso. What a great unit. It is VERY easy to clean and even easier to use. Very easy to prgram as well. Great cup of coffee when done brewing.

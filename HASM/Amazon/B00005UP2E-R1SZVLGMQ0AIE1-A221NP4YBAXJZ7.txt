Title: Good and powerful
Content:
We purchased this little vaccum for about 2 mo and are very pleased.  It provides great suction and manuverability.  We can easily clean the old dark corners like the floor underneath our beds and air duct of central AC.  It's very lightweight and we don't need to wrestle with it to get the job done.
The missing star is mainly from the cleaning of itself.  You definitely need to clean the vaccum outside the house, and use another small vaccum (like the ones for cleaning car seats) to clean up the HEPA filter.  This is okay for us since we already have a little vac handy.  For those who don't, you might want to think about it.

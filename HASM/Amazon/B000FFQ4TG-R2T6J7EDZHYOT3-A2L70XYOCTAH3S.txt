Title: Great Coffee Maker Great Price
Content:
This is my 2nd Bunn Coffee Maker.  I just loved my first one.  The underneath started to leak (which i used my old  maker everyday and sometimes 2 and 3 pots daily).  Iknew that I would stay with a Bunn. The speed of the coffee maker is the ticket for me. The coffee is alway the exactly the same in taste.  I switched models which made my a little unsure.  But I couldn't be happier with this choice.  Great coffee maker at a good price.

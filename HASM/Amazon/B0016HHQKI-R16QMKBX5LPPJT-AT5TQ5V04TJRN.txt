Title: Buying my second one!
Content:
Those who have commented before me have adequately covered the features and benefits.  I am THRILLED with this coffee maker, because it is the first one I have owned that DOES NOT DRIP when I pour the coffee.  I know I'm not the only one who has this trouble....and I have tried Krups, Cuisinart, Black & Decker, and Mr. Coffee.  Also had a different DeLonghi model that bit the dust before we bought the DC312T.  I purchased the DeLonghi DC312T at our local warehouse club (can't recall the price), but that is irrelevant as I'm willing to spend whatever it takes (within reason) to have another "in reserve."

Title: Alright ~ Gonna buy another one
Content:
I bought this loud thing at Target before I saw it on line here at Amazon. I thought it worked great; especially since it fell over often, dimmed the lights every time it came on, and tripped the breaker several times. I really like the warmth and the safety tip over auto shutoff feature ~ Safety First! It lasted a couple of years before frying two separate outlets (wall, UPS battery back up system) and later a third (power strip w/ surge protection) with a horrid electrical smell and the cord could have caught fire had I not been monitoring it. 
NEVER LEAVE ANY SPACER HEATER PLUGGED IN OR UNATTENDED; 
I never did and I never will ~ I don't care who makes it!

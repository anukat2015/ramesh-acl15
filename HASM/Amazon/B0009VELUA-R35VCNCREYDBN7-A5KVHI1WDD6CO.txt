Title: Good coffee
Content:
My wife makes coffee early in the AM and I get to it much later.
My old coffee pot with the caraf, used to burn it after an hour but this thing kees the last cup tasting like the first. Only had it for 3 days now but no issues and a good cup of coffee. Not great, but good.
It could use a light under the lip to help you see in a dark cup though.

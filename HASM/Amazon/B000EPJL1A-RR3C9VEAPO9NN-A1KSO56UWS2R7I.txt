Title: The much improved Shuffle now has colors
Content:
NEW: 
-Thinner 
-Square 
-Aluminum 
-Clip instead of lanyard 
-Docked USB instead of strait plug 
-Slightly lighter
-Available in new colors 
GOOD: 
-Very compact 
-Great looking design and button layout 
-Excellent sound quality 
-Much more durable (and less flimsy, I always felt like I'd break my old shuffle in half if I sat on it) 
-No external cap to loose 
-Clip is very useful 
-iTunes Sync 
BAD: 
-No battery life improvement (still 12 hours) 
-Still no screen 
-Clip is a little stiffer than I'd like 
-Cheap headphones 
-Still no FM tuner, mic, voice record, or line-in 
-No accessories for it that aid in your workouts, yet (like the Nano) 
-1GB is the largest capacity 
BOTTOM LINE: At a price point impossible to ignore, this excellent sounding MP3 player continues Apple's great line of electronics. The perfect starter player or for workout enthusiasts. For those looking for a great compact MP3 player, look no further.

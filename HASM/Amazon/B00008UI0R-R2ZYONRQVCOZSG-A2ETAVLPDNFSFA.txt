Title: A good product for the money...
Content:
This vacuum has some fantastic features such as a retractable cord which to me is a MUST because having to wrap a cord after every use is not only ridiculous but the cord would always twist and eventually rip. The weight of this vacuum makes it easy for anyone to pick up and go, whereas heavy vacs are cumbersome, hard to pick up and let's face it make a person very prone to injury, especially in the shoulder girdle. If you have ANY type of shoulder issue, you need a lightweight vac and this one delivers. You also don't want an upright because it forces the shoulders and scapulae up toward the ears which is VERY bad. This vac has a convenient handle and pick up is easy, safe, and anatomically correct. The other fabulous thing is that the on/off switch and suction controls are right where they make the most sense on the top of the hose as opposed to on the vac canister where you would have to turn around and bend over to get to. Makes a HUGE difference.
Yes the canister is small and needs frequent emptying and stuff gets stuck to the hepa filter that you will need to pull off such as big hairballs and other nasty stuff but if you have ever gone the bag route and realized you are out of bags when you REALLY need to vacuum then maybe the tradeoff isn't so bad.
PLUS, the suction is really excellent on this vac and it offers different degrees of suction so you have more control.
For the money, this is a GOOD product. Oh and it is pretty darn cute as far as vacuums go.

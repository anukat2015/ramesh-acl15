Title: Great air conditioner
Content:
We too have casement windows so choices are limited. At first, we didn't quite know how to install for our particular casements but we figured it out but adapting an old screen.  I have had this unit now for over 2 years and it still works great.  Some reviewers have mentioned the lack of switches on the unit, but I haven't found that to be a problem, there is a place for the remote on the unit so, that's where we keep it.  I also like the design of the unit.  It looks good and is easy to move around and store until next season.  Others have also mentioned it's quiet and others that it's not quiet.  First, all air conditioners are noisy.  You either have compressor noise or just the moving of air noise.  I find this unit to be pretty quiet.  Is it library quiet?  Well, it is not, but it's pretty quiet when you compare it to other air conditioners.  I don't have a problem sleeping with it on.
Until someone gets around to inventing a tiny, ductless, cheap and completely quiet air conditioner, I will be very happy with this model.  In fact, we were so happy with the first one, we bought a second a year ago--for the third floor, and all is good--no problems--fairly quiet, efficient cool air.  I should mention that there are several options for running the unit--you can run it as a fan--and as an exhaust fan, you can run just the dehumidifier--often useful for those really humid days, you can run the ionizer--which I think has something to do with purifying the air and of course as an air conditioner--with various fan speeds etc.
Good unit, I would definitely buy again.

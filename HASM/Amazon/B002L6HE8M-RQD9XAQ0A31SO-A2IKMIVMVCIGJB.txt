Title: Small, Sleek, and Excellent!!
Content:
I love my new ipod nano! I waited to write a review, because I wanted to make sure that all the features I was looking forward to was working the way I wanted it to. And so far, it hasn't failed! I was more excited about the radio, voice memos, and overall appearance of the ipod. It's simple and easy to save your favourite radio stations, and the voice memos are excellent for those that need it for particular uses, such as school work, reminders to yourself, and in my case, songwriting.
I'm not too thrilled with the battery life, for it seems to last only about 24 hours, or a little more after that before recharging the battery again. But besides that, it's great! I love how small it is, and it amazes me that this little thing can hold 4,000 songs! :3
I've only tried the video recording once, and so far, it works great as well.

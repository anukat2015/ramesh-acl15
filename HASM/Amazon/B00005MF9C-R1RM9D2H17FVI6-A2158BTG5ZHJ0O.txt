Title: better for home/office use
Content:
It basically works, but you may want to go with something better, especially if you want coffee you can take with you.  As a general rule, I think we all can agree that a thermal mug should not get hot on the outside!  And I second what someone said about the plastic smell-- what's up with that?  But it's an okay value for the money-- I use it in the office on nights and weekends when there's nothing else available.

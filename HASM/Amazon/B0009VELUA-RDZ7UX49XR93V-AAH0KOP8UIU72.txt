Title: If Condensation Shorting Out Brewing Is Known Problem, Why Doesn't Cuisinart Discontinue or Fix Issue?
Content:
Like other posters, this is my second DCC-2000.  I was not aware of the common problem of condensation shorting out the timer/brew electronics until now.  Our second one only lasted about 3 months before this happened.  For $99, and from a name brand like Cuisinart, this should not be happening.  It's a great design but with this issue it's just a shiny metal cube and not a coffee maker.
That's great that Cuisinart will replace it, but why would I want to spend $20 in shipping (and how much on buying coffee at a store until the replacement arrives) just to get the same model with the same problem.  No thanks.  So $200 later I'm off to get a new coffee maker not made by Cuisinart...

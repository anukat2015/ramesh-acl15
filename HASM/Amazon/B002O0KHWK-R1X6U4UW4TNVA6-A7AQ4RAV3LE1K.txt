Title: Best laptop ever!
Content:
I got this laptop just before Christmas and am in love with it. The keyboard and touchscreen are the best and the performance is amazing.  I have downloaded DVD's to the hard drive so I do not miss having a built in optical drive in the least.  The best part is I made a long drive from Massachusetts to Tennessee for Christmas and when I was not driving I was watching movies.  Sure helped pass the time.  Ane the best part is I watched 2 movies and an hour tv show and still had over 3 hours of battery life left!!!  This laptopt has it all and I can tell you I did tons of research before I bought.

Title: Fantastic camera - Great entry DSLR
Content:
I love this camera. I've been using the Canon Powershot G series for years, moving from G5 to G9, and finally decided to move into DSLRs. I'm an old photog and used SLRs in the film days, so going to SLR wasn't a problem. I was just so happy with my G9, I wasn't compelled to move. 
Until I broke my G9!! :(
Now that I've got the T1i, I can't believe I didn't move into DSLR a long time ago. This camera, and the pictures it takes are FANTASTIC. I love having the full control over depth of field, I love the sharpness of high quality glass. I purchased the EF-S 18mm - 200mm zoom at the same time I purchased the camera. 
What I love about Canon is that the menus and functions are pretty well standardized across their cameras, with small variations where necessary due to varied functionality. That made it very easy for me to pick up this new camera and start shooting immediately. 
If you've been shooting point-n-shoots for some time and are ready to move up to DSLR, or you just want a new DSLR in the low price range, this camera is fantastic. 
I highly recommend it.

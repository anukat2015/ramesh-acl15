Title: Not Too Great
Content:
Great suction.  But it is poorly put together.  I use this vacuum everyday.  After a week, the electrical connection on the pole started slipping upward, making it stop working after going back-and-forth about 10 times.  The only way to rectify the problem was to duct tape it so it couldn't wiggle loose.  I feel this should not have happened so quickly after purchasing it.

Title: Don't buy this heater
Content:
I had about the same experience as a previous poster.  I received the heater, opened the box and the heater was filthy.  It was covered with dirt and fingerprints and looked like it was used for a year.  But since I paid so much for shipping I decided to at least give it a try and was very disappointed.  It say's you can adjust the temperature to whatever temp you want (up to 85 degrees).  I bought it to put under my desk at work because it is so cold in my office.  I get cold very easily and I sit right under the office air conditioner, so I set it to the highest temp, 85.  It wouldn't go past 72 degrees which is the temperature of the office and the fan just shut off.  When I tried adjusting it again, nothing happened.  I couldn't adjust the temp up or down, or even shut it off completely (the manual say's you can shut it off by holding the mode button for 2 seconds).  The only way to change the temp was to unplug it for 10 minutes.  I am sending this back today.

Title: Very comforting!
Content:
This is the second Vornado I've purchased, and it was just great to see the updates they've incorporated and the new styling. My first one still works great but I gave it to someone to try and hasn't come back! 
The enveloping circle of air works very well in my drafty house, it sits right in front of my chair, and I almost hate to get up. But when I do the room is warm too. Being in Florida we don't have effective methods to heat our house during cold days, so I use this to heat just the room I am in, and it does that extremely well, its very portable too. For when the grandchildren visit I am glad for the safety features, nothing hot for them to touch and it has the tip-over turnoff.
I will never buy another kind of heater, this one has everything I need and more.

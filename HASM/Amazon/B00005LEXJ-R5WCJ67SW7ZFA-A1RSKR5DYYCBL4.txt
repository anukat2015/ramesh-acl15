Title: Some good, some bad.
Content:
This thing works great for an ice shanty or some other kind of tiny enclosed space but if you want to actually heat an area, do yourself a favor and get a convection heater. This thing is a PITA to light and it's flimsy to say the least but you get what you pay for. I did manage to not freeze to death while working in a garage years ago in the middle of our wisconsin winters (-10* to -30*) with it while bundled up in lots of snow clothes though. I'll be going with a 35k btu convection style this winter and passing this lil guy along to whoever needs it.
Pros- 
It's cheap.
It kinda works.
Did I mention that it's cheap?
Cons-
It makes things warm via infrared, not the area it's in, aka you move and you're cold.
MOST of the heat heads straight up from it, not straight out.
It's fragile, don't toss it into the back of your truck because you'll bend tubes/etc.
If you live above the 40* latitude line, get something better.

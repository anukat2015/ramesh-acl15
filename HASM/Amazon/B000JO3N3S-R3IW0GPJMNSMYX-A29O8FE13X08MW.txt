Title: Love the iPod nano
Content:
My kids had iPods and recommended getting one, I always said no, who needs one, and besides when would I listen to it? I'm too busy. Then I started commuting weekly between two cities on bus/train, and had 4-5 hour time blocks to fill. Plus I exercise daily. So I got the iPod and love it. I get to hear MY music, no commercials. I love the shuffle aspect within genre, so I can have the iPod play constant Jazz or Country or Latin music, whatever I'm in the mood for, but randomly choose from different albums and artists within the genre. For Classical music, of course, it's better to listen to a piece as a whole, in order, so I use the non-shuffle setting for that.
Using the iTunes on my computer has been an unexpected benefit because I now use this at work, I never had used music before on my computer, just occasional online radio stations. I love listening to classical music as I work alone, particularly when working in situations where I won't be interrupted and need to concentrate on my work. 
We got a cover set to protect the iPod; the set came with an armband to use while exercising. This has worked well and I recommend it. I also recommend buying an alternative set of earphones to use while exercising, as the ones that come with the iPod fall out of your ears. I use a set that is thin and light and wraps around the back of my head and clips/hangs over each ear.

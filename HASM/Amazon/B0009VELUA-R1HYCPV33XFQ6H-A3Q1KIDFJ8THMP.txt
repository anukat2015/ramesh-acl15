Title: liked it until ...
Content:
I really enjoyed this coffee maker, but now it's defect has come through for me too (others have experienced the same) ... it's won't turn on to brew and when I can get it to turn on, it shuts off so it doesn't keep the coffee hot and won't turn back on ... only way I can brew coffee now is to program it each time I want to brew for say 1 min after the current time .. is a real hassle.. but I did really like this one until this happened to me, somewhere between 12- 16 months after I bought it.  it's a shame b/c I spent about $100 on this ... quality is apparently poor though - I will contact cuisinart but I don't hold out much hope for my purchase :-(

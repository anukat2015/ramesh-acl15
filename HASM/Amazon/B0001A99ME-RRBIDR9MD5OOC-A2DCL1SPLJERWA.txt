Title: Awesome Product !!!
Content:
Everything about the IPOD mini is easy and great.  I had no problem setting it up and downloading my CD collection, and I am not a technology wiz.  For most people, the 4 GB mini has plenty of storage space.  I've downloaded over 12 hours of music, and have a lot of memory left.  The sound and the software is great.  Its easy to create playlists and to access all of your music.  The only downside is that I haven't been able to download other music that I had previously downloaded online.  Itunes supposedly converts music downloaded from other sites, but I haven't been able to do that.  Otherwise, I'm totally happy with my new IPOD mini.  I have previously purchased several other MP3 players, and returned all of them.  The IPOD mini is a great product.  Also, you can use the money you save by buying the Mini instead of the 20 gig alternative to purchase a superior pair of headphones.  Earbuds never worked for me.  Buy the Mini, get great headphones, and enjoy!

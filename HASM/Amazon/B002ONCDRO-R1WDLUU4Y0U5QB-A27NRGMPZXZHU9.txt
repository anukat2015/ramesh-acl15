I bought this computer to play World of Warcraft in my mancave. I needed a computer that had a strong WIFI signel, lots of memory, a fast video card, and good processor speed without breaking the bank. After several days of research I selected this one and I haven't been disappointed. It not only plays World of Warcraft with out a problem, it does a great job playing movies. I recommend this computer to anyone.. For those that may have computer problems.. Always buy an extended warrenty!

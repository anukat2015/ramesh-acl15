Title: Quiet, space saving, very nice little heater
Content:
This is a great little heater. I am using it to supplement hot water baseboard heat that I want to use less this winter. So far, so good. We had a cold snap here in Mid October and with the boiler thermostat at 60 degrees, this little gem brought it up to 68-70 with no problem in a medium size living room (about 20x15). It might struggle a little at lower temperatures, but I bet it would still do pretty well even at 55 or so. It is SOOOO quiet compared to most space heaters. The small footprint is also why I chose this and it is very unobtrusive. The digital contols bug me, but that is only my personal preference...it is actually easy to use once you get the basics down. Never thought I'd use a remote (thought it was ridiculous, just get OFF your lazy butt!) but as a certified couch potato on occasion, it's sweet! I say its worth the extra money...cheaper ususally means noisier and big and ugly...or too small to effectively heat a good size space.

Title: Great Coffee, but must be babysitted when brewing
Content:
I have had many coffee makers over the years.  Recently, I broke the carafe on my beloved Black and Decker, and could not find a replacement for my model.  I had to have something quick, so I got this the next day.  Let's start with the good:
Great coffee!!!  Smells great, tastes great. 
Fast Brewing
Inexpensive
I can only find one con, but unfortunately it is a major one.  I would say every three pots of coffee made, the coffee maker backs up, and if you are not right there to take care of it, you have a mess on your hands.  Half brewed coffee and soaked grounds will cover your counter top in a blink of an eye.  Most coffee makers I have had use the basket filters, and this uses the cone.  Never once did my Black and Decker do this, and with this maker, I have to sit there while it brews, as I don't feel like cleaning up a huge mess.  Aside from this, I would recommend it wholeheartedly!

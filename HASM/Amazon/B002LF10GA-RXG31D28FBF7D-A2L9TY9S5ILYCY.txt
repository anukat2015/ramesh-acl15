Title: Great little notebook
Content:
This "little"notebook is what I expected it be. Small and convenient it's great for my lighter work. My oldest son seems to enjoy it even more, He takes it everywhere he can. The battery feels like it last forever. I just plug it up before going to bed. It has plenty of storage space,ram and processor for everyday computing and playing.

Title: Grey Market?
Content:
Can anyone tell me if this camera from Amazon is the USA model with USA warranty?
I'm also interested in buying the Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens,
here from Amazon, but nowhere on the site does it mention the USA warranty on either product. I wrote to Amazon to ask, but got a reply stating that they couldn't answer my question. Any help would be appreciated.

Title: Excellent coffee maker!!
Content:
Makes good HOT coffee. Best tasting coffee I've ever made, the filter really makes a difference with my crappy water. I can't believe the difference in taste, like night and day. I like the cone filter, seems you can use less coffee compared to the flat bottom type. Easy to program, small profile, looks great. No problem adding water to it (you have to be really dysfunctional to miss the opening, it's plenty big enough). My Hamilton beach brew station, which made very hot coffee, croaked after 3 years so I bought a Mr Coffee at wall-mart, what a mistake, it would not make a hot cup, returned it after drinking lukewarm brew for a week. I read reviews that stated the top gets really hot on the Cuisinart while it's brewing so like a dumb a$$ i had to see and burned my finger on the little steam hole at the back, DON"T TOUCH IT!! Love this coffee maker!!

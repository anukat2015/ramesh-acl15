Title: Great upgrade from a point-and-shoot
Content:
I bought a three-megapixel point-and-shoot digital camera back in 2000 and took close to 10,000 pictures with it over the years.  It was still working fine but I was beginning to run into many of its limitations: poor battery life, slow shot-to-shot performance, inability to focus in dim conditions, noisy images at high ISO and/or long shutter speeds, SmartMedia memory cards limited to 128 MB and etc.
The D50 has none of these problems.  I took a couple hundred pictures over the Christmas holiday (with frequent use of the flash) and never had to charge the battery.  The D50 has a high-speed, ~3 frame-per-second mode and can take pictures as fast as you'd like.  
I purchased the 18-70 DX lens instead of the 18-55 lens that normally comes with the D50.  With this combination it rarely has trouble focusing.  And even if it's a little off, you can manually fine-tune the focus after the autofocus has given it its best shot.  It is so nice to have a true, optical, through-the-lens viewfinder.  I often had parallax errors with the viewfinder in my old P&S.
I'm also a huge fan of the D50's low noise at high ISO settings.  I can shoot at 1600 ISO in dim conditions with about the same level of noise as my old camera has at 100 ISO.
If you think you've grown out of your P&S digicam, go ahead and get a D-SLR.  The performance is so much better and it will make you want to start taking pictures again.  And unlike point and shoots, megapixels don't matter as much with a D-SLR.  Take the Canon 20D, for example.  It is an 8-megapixel camera (vs the D50's 6-megapixels).  While it sounds like a lot more, in reality you'll only be able to make a print that's about 2 inches wider (and the D50 makes beautiful 8x10s).
Get one.  You'll love it.

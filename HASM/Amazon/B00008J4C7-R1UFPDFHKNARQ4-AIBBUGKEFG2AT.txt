Title: I loved this vacuum
Content:
I don't know why everyone is saying this vacuum shuts off after 5 minutes. I have never had that happen with mine. compared to our upright vacuum, this vacuum was wonderful! It sucked up stuff our other vacuums wouldn't. My only complaint is, I lost a part to it and there doesn't seem to be a replacement for it so now I can't use it anymore.

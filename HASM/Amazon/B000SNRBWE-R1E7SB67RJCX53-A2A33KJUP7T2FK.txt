Title: 5 stars for this Great Vacuum!!
Content:
I am very pleased with this Panasonic MC-CG973 Power Head Canister Vacuum Cleaner! Very Light and easy to push around. The BEST thing is it actually does work on my Hardwood Floors! Dirt and items are actually picked up instead of being pushed around!! The switch is on the handle and easy to switch from carpet to floor. Very good pick up on carpet and on ALL the various different types of rugs I have. It has a retractable cord, it is not very loud and most importantly it uses bags!!! Why they invented bagless sweepers is beyond me! I am disgusted with them! They are sooo dirty and get clogged easily. After going through my last 2 bagless vacuums, I will say thanks but no thanks to bagless sweepers! Anyway... I LOVE this sweeper and am so glad I bought it!!!

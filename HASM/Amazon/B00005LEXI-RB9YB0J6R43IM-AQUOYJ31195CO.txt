Title: NOT FOR HIGH ALTITUDE CAMPING
Content:
The higher the altitude, the colder it often gets at night.  The problem is the "low oxygen" safety system built into this heater.  There is less oxygen at higher altitude and when I needed some heat above 11,000 feet, it wouldn't turn on.  It seems to be a great heater other than this flaw.  Mark

Title: "Like the bright color"
Content:
I bought an Ipod Nano 4 GB pink for my daughter for Christmas. At first we had trouble downloading the music, but the next day we did our research on the internet on how to download music. We figured it out by downloading Itunes on my Laptop. The directions are limited but we figured it out. All in all my daughter likes the color and she uses it all the time. I got it here on Amazon.com and it came with free shipping. I saved more money buying it here than at the store. Thanks: Serna in California

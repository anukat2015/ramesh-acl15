Title: Quiet, but WEAK...
Content:
I needed a heater that was perfectly silent, so my woman could sleep.  I had to return three of them.  Thank you, Lowes, for your patience.  
The fourth one was a Delonghi HR715.  It filled the bill as far as being totally silent.  But it put out about as much heat as a toaster.  I can put my hand on top of it, and not get burned even slightly.  Toaster BTU's, from a box the size of a small suitcase.
My Holmes Quartz heater puts out at least five times as much heat, as reported by my shins.  The problem is that both labels state that they consume 1500 watts of electricity.  If the Delonghi really is pulling 1500 watts to produce the heat of a toaster, it will never get plugged in again at my house.
Anybody wanna buy one?

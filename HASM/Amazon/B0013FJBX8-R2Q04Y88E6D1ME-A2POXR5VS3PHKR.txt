Title: To heck with the skeptics, this new Pro is wonderful!
Content:
I read all of Amazon and CNet's reviews before buying, both the positive and the negative.  This new Macbook Pro is absolutely wonderful, incorporating many advantages over my first generation Macbook Pro, with no disadvantages that I have been able to find.
The new glossy LED backlit screen is excellent, clear and much brighter than it's CCF predecessor.  It also uses less power, which accounts for the Macbook Pro's noticeably longer battery life, in spite of the fact that the Pro's new battery has been slightly downsized.  Great new keyboard, and EXCELLENT trackpad.  Performance is also faster.  Easily accessible HDD.  And, the most obvious benefit is its beautiful new design, which incorporates all of the excellent features of the first generation Macbook Pro, and then improves upon it.  Great job Apple!
Perhaps some of the negative comments regarding the new glossy screen and trackpad were made before their new owners had a chance to fully appreciate these new features?
Very happy that I took the plunge to a new Macbook Pro, and I highly recommend it to others!

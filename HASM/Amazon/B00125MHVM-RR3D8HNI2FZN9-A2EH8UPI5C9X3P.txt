Title: Great Camera! Great Package! Great Value!
Content:
This is truly a wonderfull camera for anybody who wants to get into the SLR Digital Camera world. Photographs are excellent, the level of detail that one gets in the pics is amazing, and it is so easy to use. Little by little one gets more use to all its features, but right out of the box, after charging the batteries, it's just point-a-shoot, with all the professional look of it. If it's worht mentioning, the only thing that I do not understand why this model does not support it, is the "live view". But taking pics the old fashioned way, looking thru the viewfinder, it's even more realistic down the road. I, as a beginner, recommend this product 100%!

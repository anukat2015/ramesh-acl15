Title: Love At First Byte
Content:
I love my mini laptop.  I can pull over to the side of the road and receive emails in an instant (with my wi-fi card). It is easier to type on than my Blackberry but not big enough to use as my sole computer.  This is a great buy, reliable and quick.  I'd buy one for each member of my family, if I could afford it.

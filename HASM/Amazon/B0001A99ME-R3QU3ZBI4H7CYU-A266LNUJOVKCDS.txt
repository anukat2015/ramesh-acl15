Title: Entirely in love.
Content:
I bought a crappy mp3 player ages ago (somewhere around 40 dollars) my brother gave me his daily planner that could play mp3s.
Frankly I was tired of the both of them running out of battery power in less than 4 hours.
So today I ran into the store and decided to check out the ipods. I saw this beauty for $195 and thought "Why not"
I am most throughly impressed. My other mp3 players could not get even near as loud as this one (I like blasting my ears). The headphones that came with it, while deceptive looking, are actually very good.
I was completely startled by the great sound quality, and how loud this little machine can get.
The touch interface is gorgeous, it responds to nary a touch. No more fumbling around to get to the next song or change the volume!

Title: great canister vacuum for the price
Content:
I've always had an upright.  My last vacuum was a bissel lift off revolution and i really liked it until it started smoking (after only a year and a half).  since i have hardwood floors i decided that perhaps a canister vacuum would be better.  i like the suction power and the different speeds and the fact that i can switch from carpet to bare floor with the touch of a button located very conveniently on the handle.  the only drawback would be that i have to empty the canister 3 times before i finish my 1700 sq foot house (with my bissel i only emptied it once at the end).

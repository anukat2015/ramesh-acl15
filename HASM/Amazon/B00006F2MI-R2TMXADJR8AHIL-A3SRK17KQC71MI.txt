Title: Easy to use, easy to clean, great cup of coffee
Content:
I bought this a few months ago and have been very happy with it with no problems at all.  You do have to clean it after every use, however it is very simple to clean and takes about 10 seconds..Just rinse the parts and wipe dry with a paper towel.  
My girlfriend like an incredibly hot cup of coffee.  Unless you warm the carafe before brewing, it will not be hot enough for the lover of piping hot coffee; especially if you're just making a couple of cups at a time.  Hot coffee pouring into a cold thermal carafe means a cooler coffee.  30 seconds in the microwave before she drinks it is perfect and the flavor is tremendous.  
This machine makes tremendous Iced Coffee.  I bought a couple of pounds of the Dunkin Donuts coffee and I'll brew 8 cups and then immediately put it in a plastic milk carton and into the fridge.  It actually tasted better than it does at Dunkin Donuts.

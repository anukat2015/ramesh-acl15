Title: A great, safe, little heater!
Content:
This little heater has saved us now through two winters and truly has kept us nice and toasty warm!  We have two, one upstairs and one downstairs and they heat the entire area with ease.  The front of the unit doesn't get much hotter than a TV digital box or a computer, and our cats can very safely lay in front of it without getting their fur burnt by the coils or grate (since it is plastic).  The temperature control is a wonderful feature as well, we end up using this instead of our gas heat in the house (it ends up being cheaper).
The other thing we like is the auto shutoff if it DOES get to hot!  That way the heater turns off and doesn't overheat for any reason, reducing the fire risk with some other ceramic heaters.
All in all I would definitely recommend this heater to anyone who needs one!

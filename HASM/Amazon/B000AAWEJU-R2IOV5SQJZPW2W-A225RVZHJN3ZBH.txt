Title: Best Vacuum I ever owned and great for pets
Content:
We recently purchased this vacuum and have owned Orecks, Hoovers and many others before.  Nothing compares.  We have the Turbo Nozzle and it picks up the tons of hair from our carpets like nothing I have ever seen.  This vacuum with its attachments has our home cleaner than it has been  since we got the yellow lab (those with these sweet dogs knows there is hair EVERYWHERE.  I would recommend this vacuum to anyone, it is working great on our low pile wall to wall carpets, area rugs (we have a bunch) and on the hardwood floors.  Going to order the miniturbo brush soon to get more hair out of the furniture.

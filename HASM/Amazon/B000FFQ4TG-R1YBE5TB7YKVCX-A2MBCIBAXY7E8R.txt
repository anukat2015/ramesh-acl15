Title: I forgot how spoiled I was!
Content:
My husband bought me a Bunn for Christmas 11 years ago.  We used is everyday (and not just one or two pots)! My  baby finally died a couple of months ago and we decided to buy an inexpensive coffemaker to replace it.  (This was when I realized how spoiled I had been all these years.) It took 20 minutes to make one pot of coffee. I thought I was back in the stone ages!!  After a few months of that, I began looking for a new Bunn online and found this one on Amazon.com.  We received the coffee pot about a week ago and oh, what a week it has been!  When it says in less than 3 minutes, it means it. I could have a cup of coffee before I was even awake. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH A BUNN!!!

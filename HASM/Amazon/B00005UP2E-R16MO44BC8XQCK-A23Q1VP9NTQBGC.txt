I just bought this little sweeper & it does a GREAT job on my tile floors. We tore out our caperting & put in tiles floors throughout our home. We have 2 dogs & a cat. My old sweeper just didn't do the job on bare floors, so this is GREAT. Lite weight & GREAT suction! I would highly recomment this sweeper.

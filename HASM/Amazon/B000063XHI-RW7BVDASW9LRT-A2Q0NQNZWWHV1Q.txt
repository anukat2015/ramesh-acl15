Title: So far so good
Content:
We've had the Capresso for about three weeks now, and are very satisfied.  It brews excellent coffee (and we're something of fanatics about quality coffee) and is easy to use.  Somewhat different from other coffee makers in terms of the carafe, it's true, but not any more difficult.
The coffee will stay warm for several hours, and because there's no heat element to keep it warm (it's only kept warm by the insulated carafe) and because the carafe is sealed to prevent evaporation, the coffee doesn't get that burned taste you associate with "free coffee" at the service station while you're waiting for an oil change.
The feature for brewing 3 - 5 cups is good, because it drips the water at a different rate, so small pots taste just as good as the larger.  And the machine works fast, although I always give it the extra minute or so until the light goes off before serving.  
The stainless steal is great all around.  Be sure to wash out the carafe and the filter holder (which is plastic) to keep the coffee fresh tasting.  But you have to do that with any coffee maker.

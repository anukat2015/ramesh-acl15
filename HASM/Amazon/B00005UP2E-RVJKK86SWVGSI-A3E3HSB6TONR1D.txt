Title: Love this vac!
Content:
I love this vacuum! I have hardwood and vinyl in all but 2 rooms of my house and HATE sweeping! I don't know why I hadn't thought of this sooner. This vacuum cleaner is perfect for my floors. It's also great for cleaning dust on the blinds and ceiling fans. I don't use it on carpet. I would recommend it for anyone who has hard surface floors. It saves so much time and is so much better than sweeping. It exceeded my expectations!

Title: DeLonghi DFH132 space heater is well built, quality and fairly easy to use, and a lot of heating in a small package.
Content:
We had our DeLonghi DFH132 SafeHeat Fan Heater for over two years, but used it sporadically down here in Sunny South Florida. Well this winter we had record, mind numbing cold. I had to drag my Delonghi out of storage to supplement my other big space heaters. Supplement hell! This deceivingly small heater was as good, if not better than our other space heaters. I love our radiator style heaters, but they take a while to heat up. This tiny Delonghi brings almost instant heat. We actually used the Delonghi, instead of our large, radiator style heaters, especially on cold mornings, because we wanted to heat up our room FAST!
 
We gave four stars instead of five stars only because the settings over the switches are a little hard to read. Other than that, it sure is a nice, warm heater!

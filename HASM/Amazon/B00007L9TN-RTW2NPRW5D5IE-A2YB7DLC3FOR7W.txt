Title: Warms up the floor around it, too!
Content:
I purchased this heater based on all the excellent reviews here on Amazon.  I received the heater today but so far so good.  I am an expert on space heaters, because I live in an old drafty house and refuse to turn on the main furnace in winter.  Therefore, I have portables heaters in most rooms.  I have a Hydrosil heater in one bedroom, and it's pretty good, but the cost was over $400.  I have radiant heaters and radiators, several from different makers, and each has its good and bad points.  (This purchase is replacing a DeLonghi heater I purchased from Amazon less than two years ago.  It died yesterday).
So this little heater seems good enough for the average price I paid and the most noticeable thing about it is that it warms the floor in front of it.  I also kind of like the humming noise it emits.  I find it to be a relaxing sound.
Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.  And the 6 year warranty is outstanding.  I just hope this unit lasts!

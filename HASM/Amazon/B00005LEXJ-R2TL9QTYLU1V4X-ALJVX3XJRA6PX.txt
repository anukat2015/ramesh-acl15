Title: great little heater
Content:
Attach it to your propane cylinder, open the cylinder valve, turn the heater control to any "run" setting, a click a lighter (like a candle lighter) near the element, and it's "on" and making heat.  Lots and lots of heat.  In fact, it may be just a bit too much heat for your taste.  But, it's quiet, easy, seemingly failproof, so no complaints whatsoever.  If I were to improve it, I might ask for a thermostat which could cycle of vary the heat output, but that's the only thing.

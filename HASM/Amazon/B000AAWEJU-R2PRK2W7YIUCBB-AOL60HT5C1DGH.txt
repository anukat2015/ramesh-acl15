Title: a little friend
Content:
The miele vacuum cleaner acts as your little friend for wood floors. It picks up sand and everything else from wood floors, very efficient! It is light and easy to use. The cord could be longer, you need a room with more plugs... It works 100 times better than a broom on all hard floors. It's good on carpet but best on hard floors.

Title: Hack your Flavia Machine
Content:
I bought one of these on sale at Macy's about a month ago, and I LOVE it. Yes it is a little annoying that you have to buy the coffee, tea and cocoa packets online... BUT... 
If you save one of the empty powder packets (such as Creamy topping or cocoa) you can put it back in the machine and run clean hot water through it. After you have done this one time you have an empty sterile packet with a small hole in  the bottom that allows you to use the machine for a variety of other uses. 
We put a traditional tea bag in a mug and press the coffee button. It will shoot a pre set amount of hot water into the mug, with no mess, and make instant hot tea. 
You can also use this method and replace the tea bag with a tablespoon or two of your own powdered cocoa mix. Spoon it in the mug and the water will shoot down and stir it up. It also froths it a little because, unlike microwave hot water, it is shot into the cup- mixing it up. 
Cup of Soup? Instant Oatmeal? now a breeze. 
The only thing running through the foil packet is hot water so  there is no fear of germs or contamination. 
*Note* Due to the filter process of making coffee, I would highly reccomend you continue to purchase the pre-filled Flavia fusion coffee pods. They are actually really tasty.*
Best of luck!

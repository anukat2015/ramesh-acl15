Title: Quite pleased!
Content:
Purchased this heater after reading the reviews on Amazon and I'm very happy wth the results. The heater is so quiet. I love the bright glow of the heating element - it's like basking in the sun. So far I've only had to use it on the low setting and that is more than enough warmth. A great deal!

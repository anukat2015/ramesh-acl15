Title: GH1 is the camera I have been looking for!
Content:
All I can say is finally I have found the camera I've always wanted.  As a video camera, the GH1 blows away the Panasonic TM-10 AVCHD camcorder I have.  The nighttime low light results of the GH1 with the stock lens or the pancake lens make the TM-10 look like a black and white low def camcorder.  I can shoot at 1600 ISO and the results are not grainy!  Plus, the size of the GH1s 1080p AVCHD files is about half of what the equivalent AVCHD files were on the TM-10.  The footage I have taken with the GH1 (as well as the GH1 footage I have seen on Vimeo and Youtube) makes me believe this camera is equivalent to a broadcast quality HD television or movie camera that would cost $10,000 or more.  The camera is easy to use and intuitive.  It is small compared to other DSLRs and is tiny compared to the prosumer camcorders I was considering.  It is really small when you have the pancake lens attached.  It takes amazing still quality photos as well.  I have never owned a DSLR, but this camera blows away the photos I took with my Sony DSC-H10, which is an amazing digital camera with manual shutter/aperture controls, especially in low light without a tripod.  I also looked at the Nikon D90, which also takes great video, but it does not record in AVCHD format, it does not autofocus in movie mode, and I believe there is a pretty small limit on the time of each video scene.  I haven't been this excited about a purchase in a long time.

Title: Good heater with defects
Content:
This model heats very well and quickly.  But the carrying "indent" is poorly designed; you practically need two hands to pick it up.  It is poorly balanced.  Also, there was a defective piece inside that rattled.  That company recommneded returning it as damaged "messed up" was their term.  Despite the good heating feature, I would not recommend this heater.  Plus you cannot place on a desk; the company says this is dangerous. Tips over easily.  PS:  Their less expensive model is almost exactly the same and $20 less expensive.  Just a different dial and color.

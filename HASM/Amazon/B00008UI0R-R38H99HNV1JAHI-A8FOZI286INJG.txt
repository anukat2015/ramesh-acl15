Title: I named it OBI!!
Content:
I really love my little Canister.  It follows me around making little noises like a Robot!    Everything is easier to do, changing the height of wand, taking in the cord, changing from hard floor to carpet, adjusts to depth of rugs and carpets, controls are in the handle, has a light for under furniture and beds.    The only thing I am sorry about is the duster. .and lack of a good brush.   But I can manage that otherwise.
To control the suction so easily at the handle is wonderful!!   AND, no more dusty, torn, messy bags to buy or empty. I really am glad I made this purchase and I truly saved $100.00 at Amazon.com

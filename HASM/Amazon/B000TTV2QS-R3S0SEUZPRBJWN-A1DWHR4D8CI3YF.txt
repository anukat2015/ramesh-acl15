Title: Good heater for the buck
Content:
I have had this heater for 1 month. We bought this to save money over the expensive propane cost for heating the high ceilings. This heater is ideal for small 10x12 rooms with closed doors. Looks sleak with an elegant design and a remote that allows control from distance. It doesnt take long for the room to hear from 61 in the morning to 71 and shuts off after the set temp is reached. One thing I dont like is the heater restarts too soon after shutting off (after it has reached the desired temp)...I have thermal windows and the heater is too sensitive to temp drops - leading to high energy costs. In addition, no trip-up control when a pet/kid hits the heater. It is relative quiet but i havent used it in the bedroom.

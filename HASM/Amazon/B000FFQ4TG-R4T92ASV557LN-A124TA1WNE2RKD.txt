Title: Great Bunn
Content:
As you would think a Bunn should be.  Everything works great.  The top slides to the side for pouring and then back to actuate the water into the heater.  I use a pitcher from a previous Bunn to pour the water in.  It wouldn;t make a difference, the water does not go in until the top is slid back over the opening.  My wife likes the stainless design.

Title: Love my little perker
Content:
I gave up on drip coffee makers because I like really HOT coffee -- cannot be TOO hot!  This is perfect for using daily.  It makes great hot coffee surprisingly quickly.  The two things I would point out is [1] don't make more than you will drink within just a few minutes because the coffee becomes burned tasting within about 10 minutes, and [2] this little guy pulls 1000 watts -- that's a lot of electricity.  For this reason I make enought for two mugs and unplug it after is stops perking.  This keeps the second mugful from tasting old and also saves on power.  
I do recommend this product -- just wish they were still made in the USA.  I paid $19.99 for mine at Macy's one day sale with a $10 coupon.  Don't pay more than $30.  I noticed people on eBay paying up to $50 for this same unit.
Enjoy!!!

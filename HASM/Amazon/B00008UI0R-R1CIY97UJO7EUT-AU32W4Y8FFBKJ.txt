Content:
I wanted a canister type vacuum and saw this one recommended as one of the best and in my price range also.  It really picks up the dirt.  My daughter used it and raved about all the dirt she got out of a carpet she thought was clean.  It is bagless and the only draw back to it is the small dirt cup.  This just means you have to empty it often, but this is not hard to do.

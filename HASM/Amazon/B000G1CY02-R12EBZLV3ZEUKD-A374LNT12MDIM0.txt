Title: Fast and nearly silent
Content:
I bought this about a year ago for my then-one-year-old daughter's room at night. Our central heating system does a poor job in the bedrooms and I wanted something that could maintain a constant healthy temperature in her room while leaving some dollars in our wallet for the gas bill. Her father and I got a nice down-alternative comforter, and kiddo got the space heater. 
Like other reviews have said, the great things about this heater are its skinny profile, nearly silent operation, and fast heating. I get it going at night during her bath, and by the time she's ready for her books, the room is warm enough and I turn the dial back to set the heater to maintain that temperature for the night. I was deciding between this and the "ecoheater" or oil radiators, and went with this since it can be easily moved from place to place and doesn't stick out too much in a room. This was an upgrade from a small fan-powered space heater, and boy what a difference it makes. I do wish it had a thermostat--it would be nice just to set a temperature. However, the only heaters in my price range that offered that feature were too ugly or too heavy for my taste. Call me a heater snob, but I liked this one's stylish looks and slender physique. It's been a year and we're happy with the purchase. Our gas bills last winter were significantly lower than the previous winter.

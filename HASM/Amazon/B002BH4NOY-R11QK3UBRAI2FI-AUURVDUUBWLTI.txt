Title: Lots of good features but also some negatives
Content:
I bought the Tx2 1275dx model, which looks identical to this 1270.  I'm not going to keep it and I am going to get another computer, so for me it was a bad purchase.  The computer does have many very good features, has a good webcam, mic, touch screen, swivel, good customer service from HP, lots of good things.  But, the computer is very loud, and I just can't live with it.  The cooling fan noise is too loud for me.  Also the touch screen has a matte finish, and just isn't sharp enough for me.  
I wish I'd done a little more research before buying.    Wouldn't buy it again.

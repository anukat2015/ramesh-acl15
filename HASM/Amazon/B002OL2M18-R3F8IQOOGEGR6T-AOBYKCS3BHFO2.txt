Title: Way Over Priced on Amazon
Content:
I'm not here to knock Toshiba, because my friend has this laptop and I actually like several things about it. I'm knocking the way sellers on here keep raising the price of the Toshiba due to its popularity. When I 1st started looking at it and comparing it to others that I was in the market for it was only $1,899.00. Now I look and they want $2,499.00 for it. Thats $150 more than the 17" Mac Book Pro. Its also nearly $800 more than its currently listed for on other sites, like new egg ($1,725.00) or even Toshiba itself ($1,899.00.) My advice is to simply buy this product where the seller isn't gouging the price to customers in order to get one. Nobody beats Amazon for their customer service and return policy but only 3rd party sellers are currently offering this product on here.

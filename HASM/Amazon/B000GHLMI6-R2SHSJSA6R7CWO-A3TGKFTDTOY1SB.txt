Title: My 2nd Hamilton Beach Brew Station
Content:
My first HB Brew Station was one of the originals and I liked it a lot.  When it stopped pumping recently I decided to  purchase another one.  Because products are constantly being "improved" I was not able to purchase same model.  This model is fine.  It performs well and makes a great cup of coffee.  I think the foot print is larger, I know the water basket is, it is more difficult to handle.  I do not like the clear visible water gauge on this model.  I fill it with water to measure and pour into water reservoir, when it fills back up with coffee it is difficult to determine where the coffee level is, especially after dispensing a cup(s).  Other than these minor inconveniences, I like the Brew station fine and will probably purchase another one when the time comes.

Title: Quality Control Issues With RIO PRODUCTS
Content:
There is a history of Rio's that fail right after the short 90 day warranty period.
The Carbon is no exception.
I've gotten the dreaded 'Upgrader' Error Message and the unit will not work without the charger attached to the USB Port on the unit.
I've tried everything, including updating firware apprx. 5 times with no success.
Stick with Creative or Apple products. Their quality control is much better.

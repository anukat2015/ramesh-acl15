Title: If only I could rate this at less than one star.....
Content:
This is the WORST coffee maker I have ever purchased.  I challenge anyone to be able to pour a cup of coffee without the darn thing dripping all over the counter.  Couple that with the fact that the coffee NEVER comes out hot and then rapidly deteriorates to lukewarm.  I thought the thermal carafe would keep the hot coffee hot, and keep it fresher....WRONG!  There are a lot of quality Mr. Coffee products....this is just not one of them!

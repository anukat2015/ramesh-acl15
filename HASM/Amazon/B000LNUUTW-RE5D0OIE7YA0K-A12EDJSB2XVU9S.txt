Title: Don't Buy It!
Content:
This has got to be the worst kerosene heater. No matter what you do to it, it emits tons of fumes. And there is no help from the manufacturer. Don't buy it, find another company and buy theirs. We use kerosene to heat our house, we have three other heaters and none of them smell like kero when they burn. The price is great, but the heater isn't.

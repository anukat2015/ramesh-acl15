Title: Good quality handvac for the money
Content:
This handvac did okay for me, which was to help me clean up cat litter and dust off our hardwood floor. 
Its quite loud when use, but its probably make the same noise as other handvac.  The exhaust is located on the side, which is nice so you don't get hot air blow to ur face. The clear, plastic tip is also use as the collection cup for the debris, which can be un-clip and empty over the garbage. It also comes with a wall-mounted holder which can be put together with the charger, so each time you put away the vac it automatically charges the battery.
The thing I don't like about the vac was the vac mouth only opened in the middle and not side-to-side, which means it only pick up things when its at the middle of the tip. So you really have to aim for them to get it  off the floor. The power button must be pressed continously during use, also no indicator light to show you whether its charging or not.
7.2 volt is okay, but if I had to buy it again I'd definitely get a 14 volt for a more powerful suction.

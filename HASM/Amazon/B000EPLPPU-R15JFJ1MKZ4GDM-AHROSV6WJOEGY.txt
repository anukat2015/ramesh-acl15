Title: The cradle is dumb
Content:
The first generation shuffle had a simple USB connector. You could carry it anywhere, charge it anywhere, sync it anywhere.  It was a thumb drive as well as a music player. Brilliant.
This one is smaller. That's nice. However, Apple has introduced yet another proprietary patented connector. It's their's, they have a patent, you pay extra for adapters. You need to give up yet another USB port and add yet more clutter to your desktop. You have to take it with you when you travel.
There's no audio-out from the cradle, btw. So don't expect to listen and charge.
If they'd used a mini-USB connector I'd have given this shuffle four or five stars. Instead, I'm tempted to give it a single star, but it's not 100% worthless.
Boo-hiss Apple. You've always been greedy, but this time you've gone too far.

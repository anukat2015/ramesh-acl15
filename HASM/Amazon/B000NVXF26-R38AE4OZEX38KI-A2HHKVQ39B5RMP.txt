Title: Fantastic Camera!
Content:
This is my first DSLR and I am pleased with its performance.  It's easy to learn all the different settings and the image stabalization and other features are great.  The 10 megapixels is great for printing larger photos; the 13 x 9 photos are crisp and clear.  I am VERY satisfied with this camera and the Olympus reputation did not let me down.

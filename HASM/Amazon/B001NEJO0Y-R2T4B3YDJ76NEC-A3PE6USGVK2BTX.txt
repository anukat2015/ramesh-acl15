Title: Very powerful laptop, good price.
Content:
This is my first Toshiba laptop, my first laptop for that matter. I've had it for about a week. The Super Saver Shipping from Amazon was superb, arrived 4 business days after the order.
Overall the computer is very powerful, the built-in touchpad works very well. At first I was wary of them, but this one is very customizable so I have no complaints. There is plenty of room to rest your palms when typing. The keyboard is very glossy and quiet, as is the rest of the laptop which attracts fingerprints like a magnet. But its purely an aesthetic issue so its not too big of a deal. 
The 15.4" screen can get very bright and colorful. Although it doesn't have quite as large of a viewing angle I thought. The speakers sound very good and can get very loud for a laptop. The battery averages around 3-4 hours, I'm not sure how that compares to other laptops but I always want more. 
My only real complaint is Toshiba puts a fair amount of worthless trial software which can be a pain to get rid of. 
Overall I would recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a balance between portability and power, although you're not sacrificing much of the latter.

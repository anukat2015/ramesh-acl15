Title: Overall good but agitator brush device died
Content:
This little vaccum is priced right, a quick pick by consumer reports and overall a nice little vacuum except for the cons listed by everyone else.  However the larger carpet/floor agitator brush has broken and we have only owned it for less than 3 months.  I am just now checking to see how we can get it fixed (through Amazon or if I have to go through Hoover).  I assume this is a one-off experience as I don't recall seeing this issue in any other ratings.  
Update:  04Jul09 to 4 stars:  The fix was simple and cheap - a &lt; $4.00 belt in the agitator.  I was told that when the manufactured vacuum sits in the warehouse the belt becomes dry so when it is used it begins to slip.  A new belt did the trick and it works beautifully. Would be nice if they provided a replacement belt but for the price and the extra $4.00 this is a value.

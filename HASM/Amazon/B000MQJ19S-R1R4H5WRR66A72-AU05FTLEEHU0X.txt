Title: Great device
Content:
I bought a sansa last year for my husband and after thinking it too much between an ipod and a sansa, I decided for the sansa.  First because of the price and then I can save any file from anywhere and dont have to worry if its compatible with itunes.
Definetly is worth it!!  The sound is amazing, I bought other earphones and wow! it pumps my cardio every morning.

Content:
The vaccum is constructed good, would have to be for the price, and I rate it 4 stars for that. It should work for several years, but for the price one would think that Hoover could make the damn thing hypoalergenic. IT IS NOT. I use it mainly to clean litter from the floors. And, as I think another reviewer wrote, there is NO solid connection from hose to bag so after a few vacuums you will have litter dust all over the large buttons on the machine and debris in the bag compartment. SO THIS IS NOT STOPPING DUST FROM YOUR FLOORS FROM GETTING INTO THE AIR. You'd probly get the same from a cheaper vaccum. It only gets 3 stars for cleaning since even though it has really good suction and hasn't clogged on me once in the two months I have used it, unlike cheaper vaccums, it IS NOT HYPOALERGENIC and DOES NOT STOP DUST. It is the same as using a broom.

Title: Beware the Blue!
Content:
This review is just to help others be sure that they really want the ice blue fusion before ordering. I ordered it for my wife's birthday directly from myflavia.com with drink medeley, rail of tea, and overnight shipping (extra $40) for a whopping total of $178. We were all excited about opening, but when the box flaps were pulled away audible groans of dissapointment came from my family as the size and color of this item became apparent. UUUUUUUUGLY, IMO. Also, the fusion has a size and presence that is MUCH larger than suggested in the web photos. "We can just put it in the back corner of the counter AND KEEP THE OLD COFFEE MAKER TO HIDE IT," said my wife! The entire family agreed that this machine is a blue monster!
I THOUGHT that the style would be rather retro and simulate a circa 1950's blue ceramic appliance. Instead, I would say that it more resembles a very large blue plastic emergency water jug with a very OBVIOUS shape.
I am sending it back for a black one, and EXPECT that the fusion will function much like my office flavia machine which I like very much. I will take the hit on the $40 overnight shipping. I would also suggest to anyone wanting to buy the red fusion that they try to SEE it before purchase.
I do love Flavia coffee, especially the Columbia. The blue cold-war inspired hunk of plastic - you can keep!

Title: Perfect starter dSLR
Content:
This is the camera that I've been waiting for.  After years of using a point and shoot, it was time to upgrade to a dSLR.  This camera and lens kit are a phenomenal value and the photos are perfect quality.
There is no need to buy a more expensive camera if you are new to the dSLR market!

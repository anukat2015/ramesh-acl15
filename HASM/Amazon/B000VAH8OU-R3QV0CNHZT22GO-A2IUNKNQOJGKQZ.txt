Title: Sony has a very poor customer support
Content:
I had a firmware  upgrade on my Sony player and it ruined it and the customer support were asking me around $120 which was more than the cost of the walkman although the firmware was downloaded from support.sony website. 
I was very disappointed and had to finally live without a walkman

Title: MSI GT627
Content:
So far so good. I'm a little skeptical of this product due to the price. But don't be fooled this thing is a Power House laptop. I received the laptop from Amazon.com in perfect condition and standard shipping was fast enough. The turbo option on this laptop is a very nice feature for installing software fast and playing high end games. I didn't notice any overheating problems. The keyboard feels a bit springy and flimsy but performs well. Overall this is an incredible deal for gaming laptop. If your looking for a high end gaming machine at a ridiculous price THIS IS IT. Nice work MSI!

Title: Only makes warm my feet
Content:
I bought the heater for my leaving room 12 x 12 and I am so disappointed. The heater is small, is producing enough heat to make my feet warm. It is good for office, put under your desk and fill warm. 
If you want to heat your room, forget about this product, spend few more $$$ and buy something better otherwise you will have one more thing in your storage or garage.

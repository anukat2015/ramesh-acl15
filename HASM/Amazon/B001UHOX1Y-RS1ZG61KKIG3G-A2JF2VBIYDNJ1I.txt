Title: Overheating, short battery life
Content:
The Office Depot tech sales guy was pushing this.  I think I am gonna return it.  It overheats and gets very hot, and battery life is nothing special.  Keyboard is sort of cramped and hard to type.  The surface is shiny but easy for you to leave "finger prints".  Nothing exciting in spite of the large RAM and hard drive.  Seems and "oversell".  See these reviews before you buy especial of the Laptop and CNET reviews also linked here: http://www.engadget.com/2009/04/08/hp-pavilion-dv2-review-roundup/  - I got is on sale for low 600's but I think I will look at Lenovo again whom I had some good experiences with thin and light laptops

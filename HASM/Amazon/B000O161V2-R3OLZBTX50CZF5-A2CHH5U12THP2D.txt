Title: A GREAT Camera
Content:
This is the finest camera I've had. I'm not a professional but travel in remote and unusual places. I must admit it is a bit heavy and not easy to whip out. It does intimidate people a bit. but the photos are outstanding.
I use the 17-200 mm Nikon lens and that's all you need when space and weight are limited. I would say it's the best camera for adventure travel where you won't have someone carrying your "stuff". I trekked with it.
Why bother to take more than one lens? I take an extra battery & charger, with lots of memory 4GB. The battery is unbelievable and lasts longer than most. Just charge when you have the opportunity for electricity.
I have a Canon SD 1100 for the pocket and the Canon G10, but the photos do not come close to the Nikon D 40 X
I would buy it again and Highly Recommend it if the size is not a problem for you.

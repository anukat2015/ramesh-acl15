Title: Squeeky wheels only complaint on Hoover S3765-040
Content:
This Vacuum works better than any canister I've seen especially for the price. You do have to clean and empty it after each cleaning to keep it running well. My only complaint is that the wheels squeek when you roll it around...those little plastic black wheels sqeek all the time...other than that the suction is great and it sure cleans great.

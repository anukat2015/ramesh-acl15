Title: Buyer Beware - poor long term quality
Content:
I puchased a Qosmio and right after the warranty ran out the lcd screen went blank. Turns out this laptop has a defective motherboard and it costs as much to fix this as it would to just buy a new laptop. I contacted Toshiba and although this is a known issue (found through search on the internet) they will not back up a defective product. We have other laptops older than this one that have worked wonderfully for over 5 years.   I would not trust the Toshiba motherboard in the Qosmio - they are defective and Toshiba will not stand behind their product.

Title: Reliable, SAFE Heat!
Content:
In my opinion, DeLonghi oil-filled portable radiators are one of the best options for safe, reliable room heating.  There is nothing to spill, no open flames, and nothing gets so hot that it would burn you instantly.  You don't have to fear falling asleep while they are heating.  They're nicely designed and unobtrusive, making no noise other than the occasional tick or pop as the thermostat cycles and they heat up or cool down. I find this a comforting reminder that my heater is doing its job. No assembly is required other than rotating the feet out--just pop it out of the box and it's ready to go!  The cord has a holder around which it can coil, eliminating the need to tie it up, and since you just wind the cord around it, you don't have to worry that some automatic retraction device will get stuck. This model can be used with the thermostat or without, and both are very simple to operate.  All controls were easy to see, even in dim light, and the instructions were clear. It's very easy to move the heater from room to room, even if it is hot, using the little hand-hold. This heater kept a very large bedroom and bath pleasantly warm even on the low setting, while outside temperatures were 36 to 43 degrees, wet, and windy.  The color is a tasteful grayish white with dark gray accents, so don't be turned off thinking this is "refrigerator white."  I would definitely buy another DeLonghi like this one!

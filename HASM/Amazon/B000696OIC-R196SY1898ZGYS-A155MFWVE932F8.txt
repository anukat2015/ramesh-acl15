Title: TERRIBLE customer service
Content:
I have been trying to got an issue resolved for over 3 weeks.  When you e-mail anyone there it take 2-3 days to hear back from anyone.  After giving me the run around for 3 weeks they basically said they would do nothing to help.  When I finally got a hold of someone by phone. They reread all my e-mails(~23 e-mails) and I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was disconnected. I e-mailed them and they responded with "oh, sorry"  Not, oh please call again, or e-mail us your number and a supervisor will contact you.  Enough with the customer service.
The coffee pot was great. But mine lasted exactally 1 year 3 days.  For $129. You make the choice.

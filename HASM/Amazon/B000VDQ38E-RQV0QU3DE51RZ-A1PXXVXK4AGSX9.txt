Title: The Greatest Vac ever
Content:
I would recommend this vacuum to anyone who has a cat, dog, or was ever fascinated by a Kirby Vac demonstration.  After the first time I cleaned- I took the vac to my mom's house and showed her how great it worked- and I was especially shocked because for the price, I wasn't expecting a lot of power.

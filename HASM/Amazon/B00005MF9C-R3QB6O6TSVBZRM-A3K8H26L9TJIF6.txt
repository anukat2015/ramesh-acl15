Title: Filter design makes for a messy brew!
Content:
Problematic in the design of this coffee maker is the reusable filter setup. More often than not, the tiny amount of coffee grounds you can fit into the filter spill all over during brewing. It's a mess to have to rinse off the entire apparatus after each brewing cycle.
Furthermore, the coffee maker is designed for the stream of hot brewed coffee to fall directly on the Travel Mug's closed top, and then spill into the mug. I am sure the tempered plastic can handle the heat, but the coffee tastes funny when poured hot over the plastic top. If you leave the top off to avoid this problem, then spatters of coffee end up all over your counter.
I wouldn't go so far as to say the engineer who designed this product was under the influence of some powerful narcotic, or had become mentally strained to the point of psychic collapse. A much more likely scenario shows a terribly stressed product design team working under horrific deadlines to produce a subpart coffee maker that doesn't really work the way the customer would like.
I was not pleased at all with this product. It's no wonder that it is now being discounted, but don't fall for it! Buy this coffee maker if you dare, but be prepared to spend a few minutes after each brew cycle cleaning your tail off.

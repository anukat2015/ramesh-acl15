Title: Acer 1410 makes great choice for college students
Content:
I recently bought this Acer 1410-2497 to replace my Aspire 5735Z because it was a monster, too big. I thought the smaller 1410 would perform slower, but I'm surprised that it runs almost as good. It is great for browsing the 'net, running MS Office 2007, and I can even play Legend of Zelda N64 ROM on the Project64 program smoothly. Adobe CS4 will run but not very smoothly. The webcam is good but don't do any sudden or swift movements. The included 6-cell battery lasts about 4-5 hours, but if you want more I suggest you buy the 8-cell battery Amazon sells. Lacks a number pad but makes up for it through the Fn button and certain keys.
Pros:
* Decently sized screen
* Long enough battery life
* Decent performance (I could play Legend of Zelda smoothly)
* Thin, portable, lightweight
* Fast Wi-Fi
* Very sharp display (makes my old laptop's screen look blurry)
* Not a lot of crapware
* Nice deal for a college student
Cons:
* Lid is a fingerprint magnet, requires frequent cleaning
* Wish it would come with one 2GB RAM stick instead of two 1GB RAM sticks so it would be cheaper to upgrade the memory to 4GB

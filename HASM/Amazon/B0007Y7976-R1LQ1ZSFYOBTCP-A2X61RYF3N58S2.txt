Title: IPod Nano 2 GB
Content:
Have really come to love the IPod Nano I got. Am not the sort of guy who listens to music all day long and hence 2 GB suffices for me. For people who want really huge storage capacity, I guess the IPod Nano wouldn't make much sense. The Nano is sleek and fits in your pocket pretty easily and its size is probably its biggest gain. Besides the user interface is really cool.
The only thing I have against the IPod in general is that the ear phones aren't that great and hence I ended up buying Bose headphones. Now that's the best of both worlds ;)

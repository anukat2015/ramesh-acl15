Title: I love it
Content:
I'm surprised at the negative reviews for this product. I've had it about a year and I love it! When I bought it I had a large dog and 4 cats, you can imagine how bad my allergies were! I've never had it overheat or act up in anyway, a year later it's just as good as it was the day I bought it. DO NOT buy it if you have carpets, it's great for hard floors, but does not work well for carpets!

Title: Excellent Coffee Maker
Content:
This item arrived in 2 days and we've been pleased with it.  At night,you can set it to brew coffee in the morning at whatever time you wish, and you wake up to a freshly brewed pot of coffee.    It will stay hot for 3 hours.  A small amount of coffee will make a large pot, depending upon how strong you like it. I use the scoop that came with the machine and use half the number of scoops for the number of cups desired.  For example, for 8 cups of water, I use only 4 scoops of coffee.  You can make any amount up to 12 cups.  After programming it, I set it to "auto-brew" and forget it until I want to drink coffee.   It is the best coffee maker I've ever tried.    We are very pleased with it.

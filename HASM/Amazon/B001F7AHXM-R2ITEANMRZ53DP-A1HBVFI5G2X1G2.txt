Title: Love My iPod
Content:
I've always loved Apple for its great inventions like this. I can't believe how much music I can get on this iPod. I literally have more music than I ever thought possible on it and It's hardly half full, crazy stuff. I even have music videos, full length movies, and a grip of photos, but I still have so much space. I honestly love this thing, I carry it with me everywhere and I can't imagine life without it.

Title: Heats the whole living room
Content:
This room heater is perfect for heating a large room. My living room is in L-shape with 22'x12' on the longer side and 11'x8' on the shorter side. And this heater heats up the whole room very quietly! You just have to be a bit patient and wait for about 8-10 minutes to feel the warmth. (The temperatures in upstate NY in winters are really very low!) It works on natural convection principle and hence there is no noise of fan/blower. The best part is that it heats up the whole room rather than a specific area. Once the convection currents are set up in the room, the lower area near the floor also starts getting warm. There is a knob on the side to control the amount of heat. However, there is no digital display or reference to gauge the knob to a temperature. Honeywell just needs to add a digital temperature display and a timer to this model and it will be the best in market for large size rooms.
In regards to overheating complaint by other reviewers, I have never had such situation yet in last 1.5 months of use. It did stopped heating the room once (however it didn't shut down as the power light was on). I disconnected it from the power outlet, and turned it on after about an hour. It has worked well since then. Also, we do leave it turned on at high all night long and it works just fine.

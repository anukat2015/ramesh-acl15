Title: One of the best coffee makers
Content:
I purchased this model because it is an exact replacement for the same model I had for 12 years.  My previous unit saw heavy duty service making 2-4 pots a day.  It had been damaged by water soaking the electronics in a small kitchen accident.  There was no questiohn in my mind what coffee maker I wanted.  The only brand that surpasses Capresso is Technivorm and that is a somewhat less convenient unit to use.  
The coffee is brewed at the proper temperature.  The thermal pot keeps it hot for hours.  I co8uldn't be more satisfied.

Title: Fabulous Coffee Maker!!
Content:
My adult children were kind enough to get me this coffee maker for Christmas.  I love it!!
The stainless steel design is beautiful.  I've wanted a one cup coffee maker for a while but didn't want to fork out the cash for one.  So, Merry Christmas to me!!  
Since I am a single woman, I'm usually throwing away a lot of coffee.  This machine is perfect for me.  It was a bit pricey, but compared to the coffee I would lose with my old drip machine, the price balances out.
It came with a sample coffee box.  Some of them I liked, some I didn't.  I see in a lot of the reviews about weak coffee.  You have to try different ones to get the taste you like.  Changing the cup size helps too.  
I bought some K cups from amazon, by the way, the best prices...Coffee People seem to make the best product.  Perfect cup all the time.
This machine has so many different features I still haven't figured them all out yet.  Needless to say..I highly recommend this particular coffee maker.
Yes, it is a little pricey and yes you do have to sample a few different coffees to find the one for you..but it is WELL WORTH IT!!  Thanks kids..best thing you ever got me!!!!

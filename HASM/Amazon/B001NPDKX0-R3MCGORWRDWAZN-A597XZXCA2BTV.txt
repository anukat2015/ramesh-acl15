Title: GREAT laptop!  (From someone who knows nothing about laptops!)
Content:
I had help with picking out this particular laptop because the only thing I knew is that I wanted it to be powerful and, most preferably, a pretty shade of pink.  The pink thing didn't happen, but the computer is awesome.  I've only had one problem with it, and the issue was quickly resolved by HPs very helpful, very fluent in english, customer support line.
Also, I thought that Vista would totally suck, but it doesn't.
I guess the only downside is that the glare is a tad of a PIA, but when you're indoors and away from a window, it's not bad.
Oh, and I wish it were pink.

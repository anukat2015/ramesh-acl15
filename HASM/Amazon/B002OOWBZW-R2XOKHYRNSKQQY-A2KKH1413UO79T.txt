Title: Toshiba Laptop
Content:
This was a replacement for a Mac laptop.  It is lighter, faster and easier to navigate, but then I was never much of a Mac fan.  Learning Windows 7 poses a bit of a learning curve, but nothing extraordinary.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has only 2 USB ports.  Sometimes I need more.  For the price it was a great bargain.

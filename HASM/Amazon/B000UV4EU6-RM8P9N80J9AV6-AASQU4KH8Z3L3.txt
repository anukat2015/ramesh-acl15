Title: loved it if it would've just worked right....
Content:
i researched this a lot before i bought it.  cnet reviews, online reviews.  overall the negatives were a minimum and i loved the look of it so i got it.  I did love the look and feel of it.  I loved the way it worked, until it started screwing up.  The first one the clock kept getting an hour or two off on and the battery seemed like it wasn't lasting as long as it said it would, 25 hours.  i realize a clock is a small gripe, but my thought was if that's screwed up i'm worried something else is.  So i sent it back and Amazon sent me another one.  this time i charged it till it was fully charged before i listened to it each day.  I took it home Friday and after maybe listening to it a total of maybe 2 hours while in the car over 2 days the battery was competely depleted.  It also shut itself down a couple times a week.  i emailed customer service again and they said to send it back for a refund cause they'd had numerous other complaints about the same type thing and obviously the problem was wider ranged than previously suspected.  Real bummer really, cause like i said, when it worked i really did like it.  If they could get all the bugs out of it i'd love to have it, but now i'm looking at the newest Sansa player.  Overall though i'll say the experience, although trying at times, was a good one cause now i know exactly how spectacular Amazon's customer service is and i'll continue shopping here and tell everyone i know.  As for Creative players, i don't think i'll be trying them again.

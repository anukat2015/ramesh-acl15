Title: Don't get suckered on this item
Content:
I ordered this item under the assumption that it was new. After 53 days of residental use it died. Ran through the troubleshooting items to no avail. Called Eletrolux customer servic and was informed that all electrolux vacuum cleaners bought through Amazon are used and would not qualify for warranty repair. Called Amazon and was informed that their return policy was only for 30 days. So buyer beware!!!

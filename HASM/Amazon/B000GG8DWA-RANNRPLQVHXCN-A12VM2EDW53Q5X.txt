Title: Optimus H-5210 Radiant Heater
Content:
Very quiet heater but it takes a couple of hours to really heat up a bedroom at temp of around 70deg C.  Won't heat up a huge room like a living room but you shouldn't expect it to for the price you pay.  Knobs were a little cheaply made but still working and it's been 3 months.  Definately recomend though for the price.  You can't beat it.

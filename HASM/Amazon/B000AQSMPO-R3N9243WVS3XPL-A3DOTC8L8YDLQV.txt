Title: Great Gift!
Content:
I bought this for my mom on her birthday and she absolutely loves it. It is super easy to use and she even appreciated theh fact that it came with a variety of sample K cups, which we were not expecting. She loves the mug size options (she prefers the large mug setting) 
I would recommend anyone who loves coffee get this product. I can't even put into words how happy she was when she discovered that there is a setting that will automaticly make you a cup at a specified time. 
With this machine your daily cup is literally two button pushes away. :) I could not be more pleased with this product.

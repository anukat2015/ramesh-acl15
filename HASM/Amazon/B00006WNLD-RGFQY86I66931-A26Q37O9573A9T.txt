Title: Perfect for one!
Content:
I love this one cup coffee maker.  It's fast and easy to clean.  Automatic shut off is a plus.  I had tried the Toastess and there is no comparison.  The B&D is better quality for the money. The Toastess took forever and is very cheaply made. Great product!  Only down side is you can't use extra large coffee cups.

Title: Wonderful!
Content:
I decided to make the transition to DSLRs and this camera was definitely a good decision. For a college student, the price was definitely within budget as well. It is easy to use and very light weight. The photos come out clear and crisp, and the 55-200mm lens is amazing!
Ever since its arrival, I haven't been able to put the camera down!

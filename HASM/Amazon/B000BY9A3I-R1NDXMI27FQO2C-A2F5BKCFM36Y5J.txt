Title: Most convenient vac available...
Content:
Just received my Turbo Vac and I am amazed at the vacuum power coming from such a small, well designed unit as this!  I use it for all my floors hardwood and rug and have no complaints on it's useability and cleaning power not to mention the ease of 'dragging it around' room to room to clean. It's so light.
   I like the way it looks!  I like the way it performs!  I like the way I can cart it around with ease! What else could there be??
   I highly recommend this new Dirt Devil product to anyone looking for a less expensive way to do your daily vacuuming. All my freinds have already bought one so I decided to write this review to let you know what I think about it.
   This is an excellent buy and value...!

Title: Canon Rebel XTI
Content:
I recently purchased a Canon Rebel XTI and am very happy with it.  I have a 35mm slr and this camera runs circles around film.  I also have a Cannon S50 point and shoot digital camera but I have a major problem with red-eye.  With the Canon Rebel XTI I no longer have a problem with red-eye.  If you are thinking about this camera, think no longer, buy it.  Buy the package.  I thought that my old lenses would work so I bought the body only and had to go out and purchase a lense.  It cost me a lot more going that route.  I have had people tell me that my pictures look profesional.  I thank them and say that they are!
I am happy happy happy with it.

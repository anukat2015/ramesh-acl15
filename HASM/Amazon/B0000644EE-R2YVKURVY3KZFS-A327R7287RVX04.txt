Title: Doesn't Last
Content:
I have now purchased two of these percolators and both times the pot only produces hot coffee for about one year. One or more of the heating elements must eventually burn out and your coffee goes from wonderfully hot to lukewarm. Most people who use percolators do so because it produces hotter coffee than a drip but this model does not continue to do that for more than a year or so.

Title: THIS SYSTEM HAS PROBLEMS
Content:
My boyfriend gave me the toshiba satellite 1805-s274 last december, 2001 for my birthday. After about 2 months my laptop started to shut off for no apparent reason.  I took it to have it serviced, it took 1 whole month for them to fix it, I was told it had a problem with the systemboard, so it was replaced.It seems to be working now, I hope nothing goes wrong, I like this laptop, but am very unhappy of what happened.

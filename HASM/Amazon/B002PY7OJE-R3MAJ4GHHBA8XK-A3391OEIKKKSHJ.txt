Title: I'm sticking with MAC
Content:
I actually sent this laptop back for a refund..I was trying to save a few bucks and bought this Dell instead of of the Mac Book I had originally intended on buying..for me, it was a mistake.I'm sure fellow P.C users will be perfectly happy with this but for me..the mouse on the laptop was very difficult to navigate and I really hated every minute I was using it. I'm a Mac user, I should've known better.

Title: Alot of Bang for the Buck
Content:
This heater does a great job of heating my 24x26 two car garage in northern Indiana.  It arrived from the seller within 48hours of placing my order with standard delivery.  The only thing that keeps it from being a five star is lack of a mounting assembly.  A little bit of chain wrapped around a ceiling joist took care of that though.  It does require a special 240 volt outlet, but the materials to run it can be purchased at any home improvement store.  It took me about 20 minutes to run the wire and install the outlet and breaker.

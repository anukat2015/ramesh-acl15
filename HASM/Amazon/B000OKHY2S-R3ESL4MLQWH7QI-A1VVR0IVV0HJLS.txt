Title: Do not waste your time and money buying this item
Content:
I have a very small room and gets heated up quickly with evening sun.I thought this product will help but doesn't make any (absolutely nothing)difference.
1. I tried putting lot of ice along with water in Water compartment 
2. Kept Ice pouches on top shelf and didn't make any difference
3. Worst part is the room getting hotter (because of blower may be?) if we keep this unit ON for couple of hours.
4. Lot of maintenance like putting water, Ice and what not.
I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone.

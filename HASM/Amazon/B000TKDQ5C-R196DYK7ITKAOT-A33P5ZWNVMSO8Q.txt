Title: Great heater for price.
Content:
I have a small bedroom that has windows that is contantly leaking in cold air during the winter.  This Lasko heater did a great job heating up the room and making it all nice and toasty.  I didn't find it to be too noisey and you just can't beat the price. 
The only downside is unlike some of the slightly fancier heaters, you can't set it to monitor your room's temperature and automatically maintain it by turning on and off.  Although you can adjust the temp of the heat...you just have to do that manually.
All and all this is a great little heater for a great price.

Title: Solid Value and Stylish for a mid-range vac
Content:
This canister vac is probably the best value for your money compared to uprights and canisters up to the $200 range.  This vac seems to be built solid compared to the other "disposable" vacs out there around this price-range.  I looked at the Consumer Reports "best buy" pick for an upright at a local retail shop and it looked cheap (also a bit too big).  I couldn't even close the bag lid!  This canister vac has an upscale paint finish that it even looks good left out in the room! Looks like a $600 vac.  Also it's pretty quiet at low speed setting but it does omitt that "whinning jet-like noise" at high power output.  I have set mine in the middle-to-high setting on the slider switch.  Also the tools that are attached on the wand tend to fall off (so I took them off).  I've purchased mine w/ an optional 2 yr warr. for $19. This is a great value for this vac that should last a while and I think these sold for over $200 in the past!  Keep in mind that bags might be hard ot find and need changing more often than an upright.  also you have to "tug" the vac behind you when your cleaning the floor.  Works great if your house is 50% carpet 50% hard-wood.

Title: Good for its class
Content:
I have a small home with mostly tile floors and wanted something that is quick, efficient, and doesn't take up a lot of precious storage space. I feel the DirtDevil is a good product in the class of mini-vacuums. It does fine on the tile (the cannister needs to be changed after each use) but it doesn't do as well on my area rugs. I like the upholstry attachments and it is quick and efficient to use and store.

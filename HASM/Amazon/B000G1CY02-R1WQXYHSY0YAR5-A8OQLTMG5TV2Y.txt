Title: Just Great
Content:
Out of the box it works GREAT!!! But when you use it first time it smells. So, do not forget to open your windows!
After it jut works ... and heats up super fest!!!
Although  it looks heavy, it was very surprisingly light and simple to use.
Another thing I just can't miss is Its sleek design!!!
I Love it!

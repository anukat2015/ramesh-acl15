Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for about two months now and it has been wonderful.  It brews a good tasting cup of coffee.  The gold filter is convenient and economical.  Being able to wake up to coffee waiting for me helps to start the day.  I agree that the numbers are hard to see when adding water, but it really isn't an issue because you can see how many cups of water you are adding by looking at the carafe.

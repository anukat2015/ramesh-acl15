Title: Acceptable PC
Content:
Acceptable.  That's the word that comes to mind with my new HP HDX16.  I would not call it spectacular or awesome.    I just cannot win.  Right out of the box the HP Media smart says it has stopped working, well that is because it does not have that upgraded feature on the machine that comes with the TV tuner.  I did not order it nor did I really want it but now forever and ever I will get this dialogue when I flip on the computer.  Why the heck does it take forever for a Vista computer to boot up?  Just give me a freakin reason.  My wife can get on her Mac Book Pro and check her email, bank account, and school tasks before I can even get the browser to open up.  The HP has a top of the line processor labeled Genius, well I think Britney Spears was once labeled a genius too.  So here we go again: constant updates, reboots, upgrades, reboot, buy this antivirus, required update, etc...  All I want to do is my power point presentation, all I want is to do is Skype, I just want to listen to my music, etc...  But as with every PC you've got to be a database administrator before you can you use a PC as an essential tool to your everyday life.  Maybe I rely on these things way too much.  I just cannot win.

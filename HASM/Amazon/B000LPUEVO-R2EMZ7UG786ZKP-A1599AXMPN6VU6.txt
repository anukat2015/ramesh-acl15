Title: This my LAST HP EVER
Content:
I use to be an HP evangelist, it was the only PC I bought. After the frustration I have had with the TX2000 I will never buy another. This is especially true after reading the problem so many others have had. There is even a pedition with over 1,400 signatures: [...]. After awhile, the power comes on but all you get is a blank screen. Even when it was running it was terribly slow.

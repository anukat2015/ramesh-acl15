Title: This thing rules
Content:
Wow, what a bargain.  First off the price from Amazon was amazing.  $179 and free shipping.  Was twice as much at Frys.  My thoughts:
-This thing has tons of features.  The upholstery brush is a great touch.  I also dig the push button controls on the wand.  Everything is well thought out.
-Very, very quiet.  Way more quiet than my last two vacuums.
-Excellent cleaning abilities.  Cleans the edges of the walls very well.
-Negative thing, you can't store all the tools onboard, only two of them, but oh well.
Ultimate test was vacuuming the carpet with my old cleaner then doing it again with this new one.  All I can say I am livid over all the dust and god hair the old one left behind.  What a piece of garbage (it was a Royal vacuum by the way)
Buy this vacuum.

Title: Carafe not dishwasher safe
Content:
The reason we chose this model is because of the removable water reservoir.
That is convenient.  I'd like to point out to consumers before they buy this coffeemaker that on page 9 of the manual in bold letters it says "Do not place carafe in dishwasher".  If it had indicated on the box that the carafe was not dishwasher safe, I would never have purchased it.  Also note, on page 6 of the manual under 'Important Notes' the top one is: Automatic Brew must be programmed each time it is used. Annoying! The blue light is super bright - I'd like to know how much energy it uses. It does call for one scoop of coffee for each cup, that's 12 scoops for a full pot? We will be returning this tomorrow. After using it once. Too many cons for this consumer!

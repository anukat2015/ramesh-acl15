Title: A Winner for a non-pro
Content:
I purchased the D40X as a birthday present for me replacing my 35 year old Canon.  The dealer delivered exactly what I ordered promply with no upsell.  I have only had the camera for a month but so far it is everything I had hoped for.  It is simple to operate, thinks for me (thank goodness), its built in settings have handled every situation I have used it in so far.  The lens optics are not as high end as my previous camera with Zeiss lenses, for my uses they are fine.  I think this is a great high quality camera that is very non-pro user friendly.

Title: WORST VACUUM EVER- Don't waste your money!!!!
Content:
I wish I had read the poor reviews before purchasing this vacuum. It was actually recommended in Consumer Reports- which I cannot believe. I was happy with it the first two times I used it- then the belt fell off. We tried to replace it numerous times, only to have it come off again seconds later. The paperwork in the box from Hoover says, "We want to help!" What a joke!!! When you do finally get in touch with them (via email), they direct you to a service center. What? Bring a brand new vacuum in for service- are you kidding??? Thankfully, Amazon's customer service is stellar, and they replaced the vacuum immediately. This time the belt lasted even less time! It came off the very first time I used it! This is a fundamentally FLAWED product. Hoover knows about this problem, yet they continue to sell it- SHAME ON THEM! Read the "poor" reviews here- the belt is coming off everyone's vacuum! If Hoover had any scruples at all they would recall this product. I will never again buy from Hoover. Do yourself a favor and buy a different vacuum!

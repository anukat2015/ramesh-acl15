Title: not very good
Content:
For the price, the vacuum cleaner is ok.  It is quieter than other vacuums and probably has good filtration although I have no real way to know this.
The cord is too short and the unit tips over easily.  The bare floor adjustment causes the dirt to be pushed around and makes no sense.  When you adjust it to clean bare floors, the front of the vacuum lays flat and prevents the dirt from entering.  Kinda stupid.
It has good suction, just expected the bare floor setting to work better.  As it is, it will push dirt away, then maybe collect it on the return stroke.
You should look elsewhere, or spend more if you want a great vacuum, because this one isn't great.

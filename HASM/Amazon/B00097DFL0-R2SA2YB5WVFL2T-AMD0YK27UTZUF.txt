Title: emergency only not for real cooling
Content:
I'am a certified EPA HVAC Tech that chooses A/C and Electronics as a hobby only because I make more income by other means and the reason why I bought this unit is strickly as a backup means for hurricane aftermath. I ran last night to mimic hurricane scenario and was disappointed at performance keep in mind my room is 15X15= 225sq.ft. I purchased 12000 BTU unit should be kicking a** but doesn't :( 
PROS
mobility
remote control
plug into any 120v outlet
removes much hummidty
Cons
Somewhat noisey but acceptable just need to crank TV volume
Doesn't really drop temp much for size of room
Room temp at start 78Deg  will not drop lower than 75Deg sad
Bad performance if looking for permanent solution

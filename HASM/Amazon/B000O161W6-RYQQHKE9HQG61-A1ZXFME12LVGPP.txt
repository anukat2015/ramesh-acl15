Title: My first SLR
Content:
I have been using a Sony P10 for the last 4-5 years and was never 100% satisfied with the picture quality but I was never up for spending to much on a SLR until someone told me about this one.
Picture quality is great, the battery life is great and overall I am very happy with the camera.

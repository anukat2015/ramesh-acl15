Title: a lot of fun, good coffee, not greatest design
Content:
Definitely a lot of fun to use; dump the beans in the top, push a button, it whines and grinds, fills the kitchen with coffee aroma, and 5 minutes later very good coffee. 
This is where the fun stops. Cleaning is a pain. The rising steam from the coffee brewer soaks whatever coffee grinds are still in the grinder, making them stick to the sides. Must be rinsed and dried each time. 
Second, it uses a lot of bean. It is a whirling blade-type grinder with a grill that allows only the smaller ground fragments to drop down into the filter. However, the grill is rather coarse, and so is the resulting grind. Therefore uses 50% more bean than grinding it yourself. 
The thermal carafe does a fine job. Thermal carafes seem to be the best for keeping coffee fresh over time; no overheating. The coffee does gets somewhat warmer over time, and it appears there is some sort of warming from below, but it is mild. 
Also makes a great alarm clock. The noise of the whirling grinder starting up in the morning will wake anyone. By the time you have your socks on the coffee is brewing. It has become part of my morning routine. 
All in all, the concept is great, the intent is noble, but the finished product falls somewhat short. Whatever time you think you might save by not having to grind and transfer coffee etc is surely lost by the amount of time you have to clean and take care of the machine. You might end up enjoying this, but this is probably a design that some obsessive and more consumer-driven Japanese company will one day perfect.

Title: Great for Hardwood Floors and Tile!
Content:
I bought this vacuum because I just moved into a house without carpet and I wanted a canister vacuum.  I have also had really good luck with the Dirt Devil brand.  This vacuum did not disappoint.  It's so easy to use and it does a great job of cleaning my hardwood floors and my tile,.  I also have persian rugs and it does a great job on them.  The off/on/speed control is on the handle, so you don't have to lay down the hose to turn it off and on or change speeds.  This vacuum is basically only found online, and I highly recommend going through Amazon.  A great Buy!

Title: this ain't your granny's dust-buster !
Content:
The pictures online just do not do the Kurv justice. It is way more beautiful than that. As a longtime owner of the Kone, I knew that the Kurv would work perfectly and look fabulous but I had no idea how much I would fall in love with it. First of all the color is so rich and vibrant. And it matches my chocolate Italian leather furniture precisely. And with its glittery and shimmery illuminating appearance it has an almost calming effect, too. Of course I leave mine out all the time because the Kurv really does look like a chic vase or a fine piece of art or even a sculpture. And I cannot believe how durable and solid and strong and powerful this thing is. It picks up crumbs, pine needles, dust, lint, glass - anything you can think of. I use it the most on my ceramic tile floors. I also use it to spot clean on my area rugs, before I do the big cleaning (which also saves me time and saves on wear & tear on my rugs). But mostly I enjoy this item for its luster and shine and startling appearance. And since the base has an indentation to hold the cord no one will ever be able to detect that it's a handheld vacuum. I purchased this from HSN recently on clearance (they were less than amzon's price) and it truly is one of the very best cleaning products that I have gotten in a long, long time. I look forward to getting a BRUM next!

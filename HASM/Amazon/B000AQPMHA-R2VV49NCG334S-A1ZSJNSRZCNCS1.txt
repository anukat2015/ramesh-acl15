Title: No better brewer
Content:
I just recieved this brewer as a gift yesterday.  It is this pleasing that it compels me to write this review.  I was a bit hesitant to ask for this brewer considering I like more than a few cups of coffee a day and that I plan to use the seperate Keurig My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filteras the main coffee for my Keurig.  I went through with it because I knew it was the best brewer available period.  So far, the My K Cup works well and I hope in continues to do so.  I like the K Cups, you always know it is going to be a great cup.  I plan to use K Cups only when i am in a rush and the filter when I have time.  Doing this, I can handle the price of K Cups.  As far as the performance of the brewer:
-The water tank is large and lasts a while as well as being easy to fill
-The brewer makes some noise, but not a problem whatsoever
-The 7.25 ounce cup makes a great bold cup of coffee even when not using Extra Bold
-The removable drip tray accomodates my travel mug
And most importantly, whether using the My K Cup or a K Cup, the Keurig B40 makes a great, hot, quick, cup of coffee whenever you want.  Truly, there is no better choice.

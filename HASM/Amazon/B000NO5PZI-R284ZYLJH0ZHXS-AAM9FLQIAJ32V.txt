Title: Perfect
Content:
This is hands down the best, most affordable vacuum cleaner I have ever had. The suction is so powerful, little escapes it. It catches dust, pet hair, everything. My daughter and I both are sensitive to dust and are prone to allergies and asthma. The air quality was unbelievably different when we were done vacuuming. We couldn't believe how much junk was in the canister after our first vacuum! The fact that it is bagless is also convenient and cost-saving. No problems in assembly. I've had it for what seems a year now and still running great! I'd buy it again in a heartbeat; highly recommended.

Title: Canon biting its nails...(for now)
Content:
Like Ken Rockwell said, this is the finest digital camera under $3000. I am an advanced user and have used this wonder toy to do all kinds of photography..action - using telephoto lenses, portraiture - in my makeshift studio using studio strobes, microphotography (not just macro) at 9X magnification by mounting on an old Olympus bellows and using Olympus macro lenses(dont ask me how), and even  everyday street shooting with a zoom lens. This camera excels in everything it does. Image quality when shooting RAW at ISO 200 and subject properly illuminated by multuple strobes, is simply unmatched.
However nothing is perfect, and I am less than happy with the white balance. When WB is set on 'strobe', flash exposures come out warm. Thats not a problem at all as it can be corrected in a flash(pardon the pun) in photoshop. Better still is to set a custom WB by shooting a gray/white card in the same ambient light as that illuminating the subject.

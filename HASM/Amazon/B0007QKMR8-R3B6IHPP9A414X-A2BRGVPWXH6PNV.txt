Title: Very Pleased!!
Content:
I am a severe novice at photography and do not know much on the subject but I really wanted to take better pictures of my boyfreind who does freetstyle motocross.  I was having a hard time getting the timing down and getting a good zoom with my old camera and with this camera I have been getting some amazing pictures. At first when reading the manual I became extremely overwhelmed and scared that I made a bad decision.  I still do not know what the fancy functions are and how to use them.  But I did find that it is very user friendly if you just go with the automatic shooting modes. I'm very excited about the wonderful picture quality I've been getting. Some of his sponsors are even using my shots for their advertisements! I highly recommend this camera!!!

Title: Very nice little player for the price
Content:
Bought it a few hours ago, here's the first thoughts:
Had no idea what to expect, but was attacted by the price and storage capacity. 4G for ~ $46 seemed like a reasonable deal. Needed something for the gym and running. My vintage '04 iPod died a few weeks ago and I wanted a less-expensive device that would do the basics, that was small, and would work well during exercise.
Setting it up: realized this operates in most ways like a USB data / flash drive. A small USB contact slides out to make the connection with your PC. Kind of cool. The installation software is on the device already, which was quickly recognized by my Vista machine. Needed to download a firmware update and was good to go.
You copy and paste files on to the device, again like you would with a flash drive. Easy process if you've done it before. I noticed there were .wma files already in the music directory, on the device. I added mp3 files which of course were read and worked perfectly.
Have not tried playlists yet, but will for runs. 
Sound quality is better than expected. Sitting in a quiet room, sounds very nice. A little high on the treble, which I don't mind and works well for my collection.
The earphones are on probation and may not make the cut; I have a favorite workout pair. Sitting still they're ok. Maybe a B minus.
All in all, very happy for the price at this time.

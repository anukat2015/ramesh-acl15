Title: Something difficult on this unit.
Content:
This product is very good and I have loved it since I bought it about a year and a half ago.  However, it is very difficult to make a playlist on the device itself.  You can do it easily from the computer software.  Also, if you buy this product, do not buy the Creative proprietary armband.  You can't see the screen once it is inside.  I modified mine by cutting out some of the fabric so I could see the screen.  Otherwise this is a great device.

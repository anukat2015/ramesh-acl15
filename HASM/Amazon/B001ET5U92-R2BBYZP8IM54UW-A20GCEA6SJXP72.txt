Title: Worth every penny...
Content:
I have had several expensive digital cameras, but this is my first digital SLR.  Simply put, I am blown away with how fantastic the pictures are and how easy/intuitive the D90 is to use.  I ordered it from Amazon with the 18-200 VR lens for total just under $1500.  You don't need an expensive camera to take great pictures, but if you can afford it the D90 is simply outstanding.  Worth every penny...

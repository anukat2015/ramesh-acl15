Title: Amazing!
Content:
This is my first DSLR, after a few P&S cameras. Although I cannot compare it with other models and systems I will say what I am experiencing:
1) The camera is easy to use, it does not require hours and hours of experience. You can start taking great pictures in just a few minutes;
2) It has all the manuals controls to satisfy the pro (or semi) photographer;
3) The lenses are light, making a nice companion to carry around, and the quality are tremendous for the price;
4) The battery life is amazing (you can take almost 500 shots!!
5) The software is easy to use, easy to install;
6) Live view is useful (although I have to confess that I have used a few times);
7) Black and white mode has three filters (yellow, green and red)...really nice tool.
Cons: So far I have not found one.
I am not paid by Olympus to be a fan!! I really liked the product and the quality of it.
My suggestion, buy and go out to take great pictures.

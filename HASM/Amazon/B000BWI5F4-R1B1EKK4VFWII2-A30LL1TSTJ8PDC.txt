Title: A great little sucker!
Content:
I bought this vacuum after a year of not having had one.  My chief concern was to find one that really worked to suck up all the vast amounts of dust our home in Missouri seems to accumulate.  I didnt care about noise, manoeuverability etc.  However, true to the good brand name, the Bosch is fabulous, sucks up everything (you can choose min to max suck power) on our hardwood and works brilliantly on rugs and our stair carpeting too.  Have only owned it for a month, so too early to say for reliability yet.  But so far, so good.  I love it.

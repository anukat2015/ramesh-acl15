Title: Perfect
Content:
I love this laptop. It just works. No complicated firewall. No MS DOS screens. No pre loaded junk popping up every time I open the computer. It just works. Took it out of the box and it connected to my wireless. No problems. A bit expensive I will admit but I can honestly say that I have absolutely no buyers remorse here. That is rare for me. The 13 inch macbook feels solid and sits on your lap perfectly. Stable and easy to use. Buy it.

Title: Love it.
Content:
I never owned an ipod before until last year when someone gave me a shuffle for a present. I use it primarily for listening to podcasts and audio books.
When the new ipod nano came out I knew I had to have one. 
After using it for a few days, I thought about upgrading to an ipod with a larger screen, but decided against it until some of the inevitable kinks are worked out and prices decline (hopefully). I mean, it's a big jump going from $150 to $250 for the next size screen.
The main complaint I have is that the scrolling goes so fast that you sometimes miss the menu you want. It will just take some getting used to. Also, if you want to play an audio book on slow, it has a funny sound. For the price Apple charges, a little pouch should be included to protect the unit. It would be a lot more useful than an Apple sticker!
As I wait (and I WILL get an ipod in the future with a larger screen), I'm so enjoying this little thing of beauty, to which I've added family pix and video. Sure the screen is small, but the resolution and detail are quite amazing. 
I'm very pleased and excited about my purchase. btw, I'd give it a 4.5 star but there isn't the option.

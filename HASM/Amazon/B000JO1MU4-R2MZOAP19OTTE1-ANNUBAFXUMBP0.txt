Title: A Downgrade from the 2nd Generation Nano
Content:
The 3G Ipod Nano is everything you'd expect or want from an Ipod: its small, sleek & has good sound quality. But as far as ease-of-use, its a downgrade from the 2nd Generation Nano. First, this version does not comme with Itunes software, so if you don't already have the software, you'll have to download it. Also, the Ipod itself is less user-friendly than the last version. The 2G Ipod had the "lock" botton on the top of the unit, and set in for easy use. The lock switch on the 3G is almost flush with the unit, and so small that you need to use a fingernail rather than a fingertip to move it, risking breaking it each time.  Lasly, when in 'rest' mode (that is, you were listening to the Ipod, but not scrolling through the library) the 2G Ipod would list the name of the song playing & the number of songs remaing on the current album/playlist, etc., so you'd know, without having to scroll, how many songs were left in your set. The 3rd Generation Ipod displays only a clock. You need to "unlock" the Ipod again & scroll through the music to see what's playing. Not a huge deal, but if you prefer just laying back & listening to your music, this version is far less user-friendly than the last version.

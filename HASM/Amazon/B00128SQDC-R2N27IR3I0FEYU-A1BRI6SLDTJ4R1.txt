Title: BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCKS !
Content:
FANTASTIC !
It does everything the specs call for, without compromise. 
Rugged.  Reliable.  Flexible.  Extrermely high performance.
Everything in my Nikon digital system works with it.
The price was attractive.  I bought one body to try out.   
The next day I ordered a D80 body for each of my staff photographers.

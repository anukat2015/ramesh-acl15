Title: Trouble free and easy to use
Content:
We don't use the timer or anything, just dump the coffee in and flip the switch.  If we're just making a couple cups we hit the 1-4 button.  Great coffee pot with a few extra gimmicks others might appreciate.  Do like the charcoal water filter.  Overall, a good quality unit that looks great.  Definitely a step up for coffee lovers.

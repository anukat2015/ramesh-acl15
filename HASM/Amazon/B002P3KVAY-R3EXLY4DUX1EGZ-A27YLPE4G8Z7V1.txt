Title: Great 3rd gen netbook
Content:
Pros- comfortable keyboard, HDMI and RAM expandable to 4GB
Cons- processing speed, no 3g wireless. The included ram is 2 1gb sticks, so you have to get 2 new 2gb sticks to max it out. The outside of the lid has a smooth texture so it covered in gets fingerprints but that's very minor.
Overall great for a 3rd gen netbook and I actually do own this.

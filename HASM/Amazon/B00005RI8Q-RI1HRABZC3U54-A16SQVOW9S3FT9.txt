Title: Shockingly fabulous...
Content:
An exceptional product and an excellent deal. I recommend getting some extra RAM anywhere online, very easy to install yourself. Fabulous graphics, the screen is perfection, great sound, wonderful word processing, iTunes, iMovie, the greatest two operating systems, 9.2 and X. It's beautiful and useful to anyone. Perfect in every way. And weighs less than five pounds. Surpasses all of its price and tech counterparts.

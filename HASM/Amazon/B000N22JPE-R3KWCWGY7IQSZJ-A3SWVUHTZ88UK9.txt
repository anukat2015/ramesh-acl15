Title: What's not to love ?
Content:
What can I say --  WE LOVE this coffee maker.   I can find absolutely no down-side.    This is about the umpteenth coffee maker we have owned and the FIRST EVER to not drip when pouring a cup of coffee ! !   I didn't find any of the issues mentioned in previous reviews.   I thought we would only get this quality coffee maker by paying twice the price of this one.    From now on it's definitely Cuisinart coffee makers for us !

Title: Best heater ever!
Content:
This heater is perfect for my studio apartment - about 14x13 feet.  Warms it up fabulously and I've never had to turn it up to it's highest setting.  The timer is a nice touch as I can set it to just turn off at night and certain periods of the day when I know I won't be home.  Runs silently - it does make a loud click when it turns on/off but it's not at all bothersome  - it's way quieter than the radiator and every other heater I've tried!  Yay!  I am finally warm!

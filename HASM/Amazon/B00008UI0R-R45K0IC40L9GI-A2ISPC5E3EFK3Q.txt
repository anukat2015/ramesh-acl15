Content:
We have been through Bissell, Oreck and many others...this vacuum is easy to use, easy to empty, works very well on think carpet, having a "wind up cord" is an absolute must (that WAS our least favorite part of vacuuming, ie. wrapping cord around)...great price, easy from open box to using and very cool looking!

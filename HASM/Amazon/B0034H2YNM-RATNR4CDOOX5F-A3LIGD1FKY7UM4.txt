Title: Sleek, stylish, beautiful screen
Content:
I bought ASUS UL80Vt-A1 to replace my four year old HP laptop.   Reading a few negative reviews on the screen limited viewing angle, I was almost ready to ship it back, but was blown away a minute I opened it up.  It is sleek, polished, and  beautiful.  Startup is lightening fast.  The screen compare to my old HP, is fantastic, 500% better.  Playing Sims 3 - fun, fast, smooth!  The only laptop it could be compared is Apple, in my opinion.    Far exceeded my expectations.

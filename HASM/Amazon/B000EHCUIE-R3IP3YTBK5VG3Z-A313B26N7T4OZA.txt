Title: Good Player with Bad Battery Life!!!
Content:
I bough this product after reading several reviews from other people . 
Pros : Toshiba Gigabeat is really nice from the design perspective , the look and feel is pleasant. The software is well designed and pretty intutive . Though it doesn't have the click wheel like iPod , but I didnt find any problem using it and going through the various menus. They are all well designed and are visually much more better than the i-pod or other similar players. It takes some time to get use to the buttons and other controls , but once you get accustomed then its a zip .
Cons : I returned this player after one week , because the biggest killer to it is the battery life, it hardly lasts for 6 hours. You cant expect a mp3 player to last just 6 hour. If I am outta my house , I should be able to play it for at least 12 hours...thats the only problem which i find with this, which undid all its goodness. 
Overall a good player , if you can live with a short battery life.

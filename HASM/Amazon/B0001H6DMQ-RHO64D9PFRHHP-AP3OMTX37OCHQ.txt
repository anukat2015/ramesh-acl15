Title: Canister Vacuum
Content:
I bought one of these Hoover bagless canister vacuums some time ago to replace a Sears canister vacuum.  We liked the Hoover so much that we purchased another one from Amazon for our daughter.  The vacuum is easy to handle and simple to use.  It has one "good" problem.  It does such a good job that the filter needs cleaning at least after each vacuuming job.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good canister vacuum at a reasonable price.

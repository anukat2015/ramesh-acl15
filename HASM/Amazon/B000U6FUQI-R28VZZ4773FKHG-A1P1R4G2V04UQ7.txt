Title: GREAT if for pet hair!!!
Content:
I love this sweeper!  I have gone through so many sweepers only to have the battery wear out within weeks...you get what you pay for.  I love this one, because it is always charged and ready, since you store it on the "floor" charger.  The charge last to clean all of my downstairs floors(upstairs is carpet) and the battery doesn't even lose it's charge like my last one(swivel sweeper/$39.99).  It looks great, and is light weight.  The best part about this sweeper is it is cordless and is GREAT on pet hair.  It works great on hard surface floors.  I use it on tile and wood.  I hated the vacuums with roller brushes, because it would always collect my pet hair in the rollers, and I would have to pick out the pet hair from the rollers every time I vacuumed.  This one has no rollers.  It just has suction from the bottom.  The suction is pretty good, too.  Well worth the $99.

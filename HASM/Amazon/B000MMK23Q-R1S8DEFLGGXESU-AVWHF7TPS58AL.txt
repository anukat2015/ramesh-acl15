Title: Lets clear up some issues
Content:
Hello everyone,
Let me be upfront here, I have 2 Edenpure heaters and I like them. I also know alot of people who deal with them. There are alot of refurbished or used units out there and some of the older models look very similair to the new ones. I know for a fact that these units often end up being pushed through untrustworthy sellers and the customer is left clueless until someone that already has one lets them know they've been duped. If you decide to buy a unit, make sure it is from a reputable seller. There are only a few on the internet and as of 11/30/09 the Amazon.com seller Pure Energy LLC is the only authorized seller on this site for Edenpure. If you guys are purchasing these units off of this site and it's from another seller, the manufacturer will not warranty the unit. The units come with a 3 year warranty. Here is how the warranty works: If something happens in three years, you call the authorized dealer and let them know there is a problem. Then they fill out the paperwork for you and send you a Prepaid shipping label packet (your not supposed to pay for shipping or repairs folks). The unit is sent back, fixed or replaced and then it's sent back to you. From my experience, the process can be handled in less than 2 weeks. The bottom line...Make Sure you buy the unit from an authorized dealer and on Amazon.com there is only the dealer I mentioned above. If you buy off another website, check them out first and if you buy locally, make sure you ask them about the warranty coverage and if they are an authorized seller. I'll write another review about what these units can and won't do for you.

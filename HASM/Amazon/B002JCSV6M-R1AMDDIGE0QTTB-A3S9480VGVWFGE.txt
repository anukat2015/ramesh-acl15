Title: Think twice before purchasing a Nikon D300S
Content:
As a serious semi professional photographer taking pictures for over 47 years, Nikon has always been a NAME to own in my mind - up to now.
Not a D300S in my opinion. I am very sorry I purchased mine at the end of September 2009. Bought from Amazon.com.
As a Nikon CoolPix 8700 user, I thought that the D300S would be a good step up to improve picture quality and use of a wider range of lighting options.
I have two SB 800 and one SB 900 SpeedLights and looked forward to using the D300S for basically portrait type work shooting Linen clothing items on dummy stands.
Was I wrong. The focus capability on the D300S is simply awful. Maybe my camera is defective but so very difficult to tell with so many options to adjust.
Even my Cannon PowerShoot S2 takes a clearer picture than the D300S
I am now one month and over 50 to 60 hours of working with the D300S with almost no improvement.
Every once and a while I will get a decent shot but almost impossible to repeat it or get three in a row of the same quality.
I am now using the Camera Control PRO software with some success but still not good enough.
By the way, It took 6 hours to figure out thet the version of the Camera Control pro software that you download does not work with the D300S. You have to download and install version 2.60 before the software will recognize the camera.
I have tried the video a couple of times and it worked reasonably OK - no jitter as others have mentioned on normal pan speeds. But the quality is no better and maybe not as good as my Canon PowerShot S2.
So bottom line... Think twice before you purchase a Nikon D300S
There is NO VALUE here.
Is a Canon any better? Not sure, but I have several friends who quickly tell me that their Canon's work out of the bag without all the adjustment hassle.

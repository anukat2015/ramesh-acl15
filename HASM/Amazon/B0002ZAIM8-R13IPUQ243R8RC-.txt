Title: Apples new "Gadget"
Content:
I have to admit the iPod Shuffle really isn't tremendously interresting. I mean it has no screen, not alot of features-and this can be a real downer for some people(including myself). But there are also some pretty cool things about it to, like it comes with a lanyard,the classic white earphones, a Cd to install the software,stickers and an information booklet and it is suprisingly easy to use. You just flick on the back switch pick if you wan't it on shuffle or regular mode and you're set.To charge it you just put it into this little slot in your computer.Anyways if you are lucky enough to own a real i-Pod or i-Pod nano you will probably notice that this  is a lot easier on the wallet(cheaper). Sorry if I'm wrong, but I think the 1GB runs from about 140$ to 180$ depending on where you buy it from. It holds about 240 songs.It also looks really cool, like when I pulled it out of the stunning green box a I'm just like, "Hey, this looks kinda cool!". It is also the smallest and lightest i-Pod yet. So there you have it, my review for this new  "gadget", and even though it's not suped up, like all the other i-Pod's it's still is a cool and "cheaper" gift to give to anyone who is a fan of i-Pod's.

Title: Attractive and Efficient Small Heater
Content:
This heater does a pretty good job for its' size.  It's a little pricey though, compared to others with the same output.  I haven't had it long so I can't comment on it's durability.  It has a rather elegant design and is very quiet so it could be used unobtrusively in any small room.  I use it in a workshop so those two qualities are moot.  I'm happy with it and I recommend it.

Title: Only worked for 3 days
Content:
I purchased this product for my girlfriend to give to her daughter.  The item worked for roughly 3 days after Christmas then locked up solid.  We have been unable to get in touch with the company via email or phone.  It appears that they have a firmware update that MIGHT have prevented this issue.  We will continue to try and get this problem rectified, but I would not recommend purchasing this product or dealing with this company in the future.

Title: Fantastic Coffeemaker
Content:
All I can say is that this coffeemaker lives up to the fantastic reputation of KitchenAid.  Works perfectly and makes the best coffee I have ever had.  I have had quite a few different brands in the past and most of them high-end coffeemakers, but this one is, without a doubt, the best.  The amount of coffee you can make is great, either a small amount or large amount.  We have a carafe and when we entertain an extra large group of coffee drinkers we just make a pot of coffee and put it into the carafe and then make another pot and leave in on the KitchenAid and there is plenty of great coffe for everyone.

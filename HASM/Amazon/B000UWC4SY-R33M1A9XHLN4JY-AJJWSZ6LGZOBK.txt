Title: Not bad for under $20
Content:
We bought this model of B&D 5 cup coffee maker from Walmart but our unit has the glass carafe.  I looked at both the programmable Mr. Coffee 4 cup and this model. We liked this model slightly better than the Mr. Coffee because it had an auto shut off feature, programmable start, easy to see water reservoir, gold mesh coffee filter included, the fact it was a 5 cup not a four cup, and it seemed to be a better over all design. My only complaints are that the programming pad is quite poorly made and this unit does not have a pause feature when you remove the carafe while brewing. Our programming pad does function well but I suspect that it will be the first thing to go.

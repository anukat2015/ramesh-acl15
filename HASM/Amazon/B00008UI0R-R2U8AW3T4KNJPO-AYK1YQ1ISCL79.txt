Title: the best vacuum ever.
Content:
I am a vacuum fanatic, and let me tell you I go through vacuums very quickly.  I decided to buy a smaller vacuum that was bagless this time seeing my other vacuum I had for 1 1/2 year lost allof its suction power, so I searched the internet and read some reviews on them and decided to buy this one, AND BOY AM I HAPPY I DID, this vacuum has so much suction power and pulls dirt up that I didn't even know existed I am so pleased  and I would highly recommend this vacuum to everyone.

Title: Waiting on 2nd replacement
Content:
First camera has all kinds of dust on the mirror and/or the internal eyepiece optics. No luck cleaning it so it went back. The replacement came right away (Amazon so far has been awesome as usual). Taking a shot underexposed I noticed a bad pixel (without enlarging or anything) I then took a quick shot with the lens cap on and noticed many dead pixels. The ones stuck in red are the most annoying. So this camera is going back as well.
I will update when the third arrives. If that's bad I might just check out the 50D and if that's bad I guess give Nikon a shot. 
I understand a few bad pixels, my rebel XT has about 10-12. But the whole reason I am getting a new camera is for night use because of those bad pixels and having them right out of the box is unacceptable. 
Price, features and the lens deal on the 55-250 are great! But if I cant get a good copy maybe its not such a good deal.

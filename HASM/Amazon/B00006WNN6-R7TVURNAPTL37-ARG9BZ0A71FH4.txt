Title: Small Fan  That  Gives Good Warmth
Content:
I decided since my roommate was being energy efficient with the thermostat that I needed to get a safe small heater for my room. I love that it doesn't have a metal grill and that's basically a large blow dryer. It takes about 15 mins to get a small room warm. I love that it will monitor the temp and shut off and on to keep it not too hot. It's not very loud either. It's a great buy at 19 dollars.

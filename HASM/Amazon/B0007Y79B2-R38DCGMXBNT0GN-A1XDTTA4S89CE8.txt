Title: iPod Nano
Content:
I definitely love the iPod Nano, it's beautiful and ultra slim!  I do have to agree that it is VERY VERY FRAGILE!  It's different than the older one, not talking about scratches at all, since that's reasonable.  The LCD screen on the iPod Nano is absolutely the most fragile I've seen in electronics, mainly because it is SO thin.  You cannot put ANY pressure onto the LCD screen, not even an accidental bump, it will ruin the screen with lines just like that!  And yes, you cannot even drop it a foot above on anything, it will once again ruin the LCD screen.  The iPod itself will be fine, it'll play no problem, and no scratches or damage on the surface of the iPod, but the LCD screen is done.  Other than that, I LOVE the iPod Nano.  Just make sure you protect that LCD screen like an eggshell.

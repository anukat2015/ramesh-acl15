Title: Still new, but does what it should
Content:
This is the same item you should be able to get at one of those big warehouse stores for a few less dollars.  I've only used it a few days, but I do like it more than the old radiator style heater I have.  Heats up quickly, has a lo and high power button along with a simple knob for temperature, doesn't give you any numbers for the temp though.  Sets up easily and quickly, but once you put the feet on it, it won't go back into the box for storage.  My dog has laid in front of it with his back touching it and apparently it didn't burn him.  Sturdy, not worried about it tipping over.  Is quiet.  So far so good.  Mine didn't give off any funky odor either when I first turned it on.  I'd get another one if I was rolling in dough, alas, but I am not. 
  This style is designed for larger living areas, I have it in a two story family room, so I know it won't heat up the whole area, but at least the area around the beloved TV.

Title: Read and question the fine print
Content:
This is the second Vornado space heater I purchased from Amazon. Unlike the first, this one lacks a digital display on top showing temperature settings and readings. That's a negative. But I'm confused by a detail in the product description that convinced me to order this model: rated to heat a 16' x 16' room with an 8' ceiling. The unit is identical in size and weight and output to my first purchase, which is rated to heat a 10' x 10' room with an 8' ceiling. So I feel that the product description of this item is probably incorrect, though it is still a good product. Just not one that is designed to heat a 16' x 16' x 8' space.

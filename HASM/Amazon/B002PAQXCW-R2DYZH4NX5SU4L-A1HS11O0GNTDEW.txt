Title: Awesome Gaming Laptop
Content:
I've had this laptop for about 4 months now and I love it. It plays all my CnC games on the highest video settings and plays very smooth. I love having two hard drives so  I can keep backups on one. I also use virtual pc's and they work great on Window's 7 64bit. I can have a vpc running with Sql Server working on SSIS/SSAS packages and leave it running while I switch over to war gaming for the night. Best laptop I've owned so far including Alienware which costs almost twice as much if you configure it like this one.

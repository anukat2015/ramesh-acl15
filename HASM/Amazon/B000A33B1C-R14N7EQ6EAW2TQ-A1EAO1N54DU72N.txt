Title: replace old heater
Content:
i brought this heater at amazon.com for 70.00 plus free shipping. what a great deal. i replaced my old lakewood heater from walmart. what a difference. this heater works 5 times better than a lakewood oil heater. i brought a second one from amazon.com.  it has been 18 degrees in illinois for the past 3 days and the 2 heaters heat my whole house! my house is brick and about 1100 sq. feet. keeps it 73 degrees. my furance has not been on at all. will wait to see electric bill next month. hope it is good news.

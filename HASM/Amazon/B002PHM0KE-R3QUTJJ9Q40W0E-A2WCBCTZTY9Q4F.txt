Title: A Winner!

Purchased new Oct. 2009
This was a Birthday present for my wife who has an old (in computer time) Dell desktop running XP - slow but satisfactory.  Research began with a Toshiba Netbook which she liked but not as a primary computer - small screen, no optical drive.  We then moved to Best Buy where she looked and tried a broad range of Laptops- settling on this Sony and a Toshiba (she had a Toshiba laptop 10 years ago).  Back home we researched both with help from  Amazon's wide selection.  The next morning she said did you order the Sony from Amazon?   Yes, and Amazon did their part - swiftly.
She is pleased with her choice, likes the feel of the keyboard, appearance of the screen and the 64 bit version of Windows 7, and, of course, the speed.  The file migration is just beginning so I'm sure she will find many other features to praise.  For myself, a refugee from MS, it feels like a MacBook!

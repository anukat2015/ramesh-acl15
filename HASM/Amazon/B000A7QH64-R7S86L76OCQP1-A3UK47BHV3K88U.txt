Title: Charging Stand \ Wall hanging unit no longer available!
Content:
I bought this product based on the reviews, and I was aware that I was going to need to order the wall hanging unit separately.  Called Shark today and found out that they no longer carry the wall hanging unit.  Great vac, but not real convenient now that I can't hang it on the wall in my broom closet.  Buyer beware!

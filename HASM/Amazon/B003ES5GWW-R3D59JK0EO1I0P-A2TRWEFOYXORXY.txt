Title: Zune HD Rocks
Content:
Purchased my Zune-HD about 4 weeks ago, and I must say, it has been used far more than my IPOD 30GB "Classic" ever was. Far more functional, and its features will make it useful for some time to come. I have always been quite skeptical of music subscriptions, but the Zune Pass is really a nice feature. For $14.95 per month, I get to download ("borrow") all the music I want (no limits). Added to this is the ability to keep 10 songs per month. Even if my subscription runs out, the 10 songs I have selected to keep each month are mine. The others I've downloaded will no longer be available. 
As for the unit, it's easy to operate, easy to set up and appears to be quite robust. The graphical display is without equal. Bright, clear and very crisp. Several features are worth noting. The HD Radio built in gives it the edge over most other mp3 players (including the iTouch). We have quite a number of local stations that provide HD stations, and the difference in clarity and quality is amazing. The wireless sync feature is also a huge plus, too. Using Zune's computer software is as easy as using Windows Media Player, and keeps everything neat and tidy.
Overall, I'm completely satisfied with my purchase. It was definitely an impulse buy, and I felt a bit guilty after submitting my order, realizing I probably couldn't justify it, given I used my Ipod so seldom, but after getting it, I realized I have used it nearly everyday, and truly enjoyed it.
Don't hesitate to jump into the world of Zune, even if you are a diehard Apple fan. You won't be disappointed.

Title: Good... but NOT great.
Content:
DISAPPOINTMENTS:
After previously owning a 20D for 3 years it seemed like there should have been some significant improvements (and there has been).
However, the 40D introduced an issue with the viewfinder (glare around the top focus point -- Note this is a known issue but Canon doesn't consider it a problem) and the selected focus point seems to be forgotten after powering down.
Finally, the picture quality (in my opinion) appears to be equal, or in some cases less than the 20D (tends to have significant noise).
IMPROVEMENTS:
The focus seems to be faster/better and the huge LCD is a blessing.  ~5% extra in the viewfinder is very nice as well.
CONCLUSION:
I would recommend waiting for the 50D so that Canon will hopefully get some of these things worked out.

Title: Hoover WindTunnel
Content:
I really like the suction power of this vacuum but there are a couple drawbacks. First of all the hose does not swivel and gets twisted quite easily. Secondly, the hose is not very long so you have to pull the machine every two steps or so. Finally, the drag on the carpet is hard so it takes more effort to vacuum than one that has "power drive". Overall, I like the size and power of the machine, with a few improvements this would be a great product!

Title: After two years on the Market you know what you're getting
Content:
Its not the greatest camera on the market but it is most likely one of the best values going. I love the fact it takes ALL F-mount Nikon lenses, I don't know if Nikon meant for this to be a "feature" but it is nice little plus for the d40/60 bodies - saving money while getting glass you couldn't otherwise (you do have to put up with not metering, but its not as much of a PITA as it sounds, check out the lively non-metering Nikon forum on flickr).
In any case, this poor thing may well be discontinued in a couple weeks so I would keep an eye out on for the latest version.  If you still want the D40 after the shiny new entry level Nikon is released then get snappy and get it while its still available. The only reason I would upgrade is if this camera broke down on me because its small, fun, light and works well enough that I don't have any complaints at the moment, other than fact I feel it gets unusably grainy past 800 ISO.

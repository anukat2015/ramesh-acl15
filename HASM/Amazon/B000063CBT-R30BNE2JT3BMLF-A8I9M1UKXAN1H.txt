Title: Don't waste your $$$
Content:
This thing is awful, we asked for a coffee, espresso, cappucino etc. machine for Christmas last year, so my grandparents gave us $100 to purchase on because they didn't know which one to get.  We didn't do research and thought Delonghi was a great brand, well needless to say we unfortunately blew our 100 on this piece of crap.  The directions are SO complicated, we were never able to froth milk or anything all we could do was make a leaky pot of coffee! I wouldn't pay a dime for this thing, it's bulky and junky, splurge if you really want a multi-task coffee maker, just don't go with Delonghi!!!

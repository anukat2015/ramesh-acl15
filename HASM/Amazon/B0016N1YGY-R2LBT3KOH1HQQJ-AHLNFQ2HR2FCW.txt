Title: Amazing how a far a little H2O can go...
Content:
I currently own 2 other portable AC units (1 Sharp, 1 Danby...both waterless) due to the window's I have in the old house my apartment is in and this Delonghi blows the other 2 out of the water...no pun intended.  I was skeptical about having to add water to this unit, but the level of performance it produces due to this is well worth it.  This is now the only unit I leave on during the day for my pets while I'm at work...as long as I leave the doors to the other rooms open, it will keep my entire apartment cool even during the hottest summer days.  My other 2 units couldn't produce the same results in tandem.  100% satisfied with this green machine.  Gotta love Italian craftmanship!!!  Anyone want to buy one of my old AC's?

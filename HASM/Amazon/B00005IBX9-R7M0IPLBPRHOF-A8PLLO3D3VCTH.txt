Title: Great looks - weak design.
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker after using two inexpensive Kenmore coffeemakers for the last eight years. I thought this would be much better than the others even at double the price - WRONG!Pros:*Coffee tastes great.*Cool looking - sleek.*Coffee is HOT.Cons:*Water tank is narrow and difficult to fill - I frequently miss and pour water all over the counter.*You must measure the water in the pot before filling the tank - the tank has a very lame water level indicator.*When the coffee is done brewing - an annoying series of beeps (5) indicates when it's ready to drink - it's loud at 5 A.M.!This coffeemaker looks great in the kitchen, but it's not the best design - the water tank BLOWS!

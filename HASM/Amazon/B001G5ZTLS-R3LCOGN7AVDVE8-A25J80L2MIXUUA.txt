Title: back focusing problem
Content:
I sold my Canon 1d Mark II on ebay and bought this one.  Took various test shots and noticed that some shots were a bit out of focus.  So i set up a grid at a 45 degree angle and noticed that the camera was focusing past the focus lock point.  I tested with various back focusing test online and sure enough it was back focusing.  A while ago i had this problem with my Canon 10d and had sent it to canon for repair 3 times and they said they could not fix it and i was too picky.  Well if i am going to spend 2700 on a camera with 21 megapixels, darn tootin i am going to be picky.
5 stars to Amazon, i had the camera 25 days and they let me return it. I will always buy from Amazon just for this reason, a very good return policy, even on digital cameras where most give you only 10 days then a huge restocking fee.

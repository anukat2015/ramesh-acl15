Title: Ipod nano 8
Content:
I bought an apple Ipod Nano 8GB as a gift. It had poor sound and wasn't in stereo so my friend exchanged it. The second one clicked when the volume was raised or lowered so she returned it and asked for an exchange. She was told there were no more.  No More?? So I'm getting a refund.

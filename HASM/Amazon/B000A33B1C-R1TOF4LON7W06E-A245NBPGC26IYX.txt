Title: Nice little heater
Content:
I purchased this with some trepidation.  There are a lot of options for room space heating and all seem to come with some disadvantages.  As this was going in a teenagers attic bedroom, safety and simplicity were very important, as was the ability of the heater to adequately warm the space.  I've been pleasantly surprised by how well made this heater appears to be and how effectively it heats the space, maintaining it at a relatively constant temperature for as long as we leave it on.  This is after a couple of months of use, though admittedly not in the coldest part of the year.

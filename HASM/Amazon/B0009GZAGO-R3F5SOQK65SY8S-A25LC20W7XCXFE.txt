Title: Easy To Use
Content:
I purchased from Amazon on a Monday and received it by Thursday with the 2-day shipping. Charged the battery and was snapping photo's that afternoon of my daughter's track meet. That is the reason I purchased the Nikon D50 with the 18-55mm and 55-200mm lens kit. One of my peeves in non SLR digital camera's is the lag time between shots. You never seem to get the shot you wanted. With the D50, I was able to continuous shoot frames to my satisfaction. It did appear to be at least the 2.5 shots per second as advertised. Everything that I needed to do so far has been pretty easy to set up on the camera. I have not taken any night shots yet and hope that it works well in-doors. As another pet peeve of mine,"Red-Eye" with these small digital cameras. Only thing you need to do if you purchase...get a memory card along with your purchase...The camera does not come with even a small (64mb) card! My only negative but not enough to cost them a full "Star" in the rating. So if I had the choice, it would have been 4.5 stars but only because Nikon did not include even a small SD memory card.

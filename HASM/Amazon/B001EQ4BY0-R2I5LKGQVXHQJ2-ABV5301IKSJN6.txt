Title: great for artists pursuing careers in photography
Content:
second camera I've owned in the canon digital SLR series. Much better than the 20D I last had, I'm sure I'll eventually move onto a higher camera but as a college student still in the phase of moving into the professional career, this is definitely a strong purchase in the right direction.
I'd reccommend this product to anyone who has knowledge in photo and Canon SLR's. Not recommended for someone just starting out.

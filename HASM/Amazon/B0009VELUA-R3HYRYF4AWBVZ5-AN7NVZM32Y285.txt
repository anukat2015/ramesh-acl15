Title: The best coffee maker
Content:
out there. Why do I think so ?  No carafe, stainless steel, cleans extremely easy, clock, makes 12 cups, makes 1-4 cups, keeps coffee piping hot for over 2 hours, water filtration, auto program, auto off, and controls are on top of the coffee maker, not below, 3 year warranty...
I've put 2 coffee makers out of commission by cracking the carafe and spilling liquids on the controls.
But don't believe me, try this one for yourself, it's a gem. Oh, and the coffee tasted great too.

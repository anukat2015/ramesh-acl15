Title: Good for a small room
Content:
I bought this heater on a Friday sale so I got a good price on it.  I was looking for a small heater to warm a bathroom during Illinois winters and this has fit the bill.  The heat output is great for the small room, it heats up in about 2 mins and needs to be turned down after 10 mins.  The controls are not the best as mentioned in other reviews the "on" dial is like a kitchen timer that ticks all the time.  But for the hour I need it in the mornings, it works really well.

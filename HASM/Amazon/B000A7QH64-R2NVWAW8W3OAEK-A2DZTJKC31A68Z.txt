Title: a great vacuum, but no legs
Content:
i bought this vacuum several months ago, and am extremely satisfied - sometimes amazed - by its performance.  unfortunately it came with a charging plug, but no stand or wall mount.  i immediately ordered two stands(anticipating i would buy another unit for a second home.)  months later, nothing but apologies and a vacuum lying on the floor attached to a wire.  i see the present product description includes a mount.  be sure!

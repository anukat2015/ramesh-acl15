Title: Ipod touch what else can someone say
Content:
I am older 66 and modern tech is my hobby and when my daughter showed me her Ipod I had to get one and sure glad I did. It has been helpful with most of what Il. do and handy to.  Only negative is when on the internet hard time reading some of the web pages as they are very small or at least have not figured out out to make them larger to read.  Great investment and handy too

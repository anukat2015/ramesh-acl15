Title: Wonderful!
Content:
I received my heater and as instructed, plugged in in outside on the porch and set it to full for 2 hours to burn off the protective anti-corrosive coating. It did smell at first but the smell was gone after a couple hours, and I brought it inside. I have a very sensitive nose, and there was no smell. The heat is gentle and pleasant like the feeling of a warm sunbeam on a cool day. It is completely silent and reasonably good looking. The rollers were easy to install and it came with the mounting bracket and screws with anchors to mount on the wall, which we plan to do this weekend to save space. We're going to order 2 more for other rooms! The current heater is in our bedroom which is about 12' x 15', so we want one for the living room and office as well.
As someone else mentioned, an actual digital thermostat (instead of the dial which reads "1 - 6" would make this item ideal.
Update: We now have 3 of these heaters running, we have them set to "low power" (1) and around "3" on the temperature dial. We have our main gas furnace off and the heaters have been keeping our 500 square foot cottage very comfortable when the temps are around 34 F at night and 55 - 60 F during the day. My allergies are so much better!

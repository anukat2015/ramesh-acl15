Title: Good product, rude support
Content:
The main person you call for support was extremely rude with me, when I explained that the remote I got didn't work. All he said was a "tech guy" would call later. When I called back several hours later, he simply hung up on me. Right after that, the technician finally called to gather the data necessary to send me a working remote. 
I cannot review the function of the unit, because the remote controls everything. All I can report is that this unit is beautifully made, the finish is similar to a nice refrigerator. The window kit is also extremely easy to use. I think this unit will last a very long time, it is very heavy and made of quality components.
EDIT: After using this for a few weeks, I have to say it does work extremely well. Despite the fact that it does use more electricity, cold air comes out of the vent within seconds of the compressor kicking in. Other units I have used, took up to five minutes before you got cold air. Lots of electricity wasted there. This unit has dual fans, one for the blower and another one to intake and exhaust air. This helps keep the unit right at the optimal operating temperature. Dual hose units are far more efficient because they don't rely on stale room air, they take in fresh outside air, cool it and exhaust it. This unit puts out the coldest air I've felt from any portable.
My only complaint, it can trip the breaker on my power strip, when combined with an air purifier. You will need to be aware that this unit uses 10.5 amp, even more than that to start up.

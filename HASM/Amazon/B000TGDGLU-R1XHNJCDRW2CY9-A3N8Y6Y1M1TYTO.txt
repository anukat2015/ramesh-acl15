Title: Does a great job!
Content:
We purchased our first DeLonghi radiator a couple of weeks back. The unit required no assembly of any kind. All you need to do is fold the wheels out after removing the unit from the box.  The heat this unit produces is impressive! It raised the temperature by at least 10 degrees within an hour in an approximately 200 sq. ft area in our basement. This area has no other heat source and borders our garage.  The controls are easy to use, and the ComforTemp feature is quite nice.  We just purchased a 2nd unit to use around the house!

Title: NOTHING CLASSIC HERE!!!!!!
Content:
The new iPod classic is a huge disappointment. When this was released in September, Apple should have trimmed the scroll wheel to the size of the nano's wheel, increased the screen size or memory size. Instead they failed to do everything that would improve the iPod classic. On top of that, the black model still has that cheap AWFUL looking plastic. The iPod is a decent MP3 player and its ease of use is great. But its flaw comes in the fact that its failed to EVOLVE properly. The Zune atleast has a huge 3.2 inch screen while the iPod size has remained the same. I actually miss the 160GB model because i needed the extra memory space. Another sad note is that the new 4G iPod Nano has more new features than this model. DOes that make any sense?

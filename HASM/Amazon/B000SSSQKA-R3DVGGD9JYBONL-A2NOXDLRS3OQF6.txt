Title: So far, very good
Content:
We bought this Panasonic because we had an older version of the same size and price point and it lasted for 12-14 years.  The new vacum we received from Amazon had a missing suction control so after calling Panasonic and getting transferred to hell and back FINALLY they were "very sorry" and helpful and sent us an entirely new vacum hose with no need to return the old one...very nice.  The suction is great, the brushes on the main attachement turn by air suction and not on their own, but with enough force to help clean up threads and lose items on the carpet.  The 360 hose turning feature is good as is the retractable cord (although a bit short).  The real wheels are great for rolling over area rugs and thresholds but the front wheel is so small it often gets caught and does not allow the vacum to "follow" you easily.  The design is sweet and compact and takes up very little room.  The basic attachement is a little heavy...also with tiny wheels that do not roll and allow much manueverability... AND is a little difficult to detach (though this may loosen with use).  The two small attachements fit neatly in the rear of the vacum which makes for easy access.  ALL IN ALL for the price it seems a great bargin so far.  We have only had this one for a month and so far, very good.  If it lives up to its older brother/sister machine it will be a real winner.

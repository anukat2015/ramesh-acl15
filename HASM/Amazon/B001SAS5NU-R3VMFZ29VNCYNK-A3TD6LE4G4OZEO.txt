Title: Awesom vacuum for 1/2 the price
Content:
Most of our carpeted space is either on stairs or under beds, so the canister vac was the better option.  I was surprised at how few canisters I could find in the stores.  I didn't want to spend $500 (or more) for a vacuum but I also didn't want to spend $150 for a vacuum that didn't work.  The factory reconditioned was a great chocie.  It looks brand new, it has a six month warranty, and the Dyson really does the job.  A rug that we had regularly vacuumed with an old vac, quickly filled with dust.  With no tax and free shipping, we probably paid half of what a new one would have cost in the stores.

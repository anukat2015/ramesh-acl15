Title: Don't buy HP
Content:
I have had nothing but problems getting service for my HP. I get different answers from different people who can't understand me.
If you run into a problem, they stink at trying to help. The extra money for a different company is sure to be worth the sloppy job they do on their computers. A mother board they replaced has a problem six months later and they want me to pay them to diagnose the problem that I already have identified. They want me to buy a new motherboard because its "out of warranty."  ?? Too much money to not stand by your product.

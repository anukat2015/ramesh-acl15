Title: Work well out of the Box
Content:
Runs cool (Temp), I hope it will not burn up like my HP's (four) have done.
Glad after much reading & research I bought it for my wife.
Hope it keeps running well.
Enjoy the change of color to red from the typical black case. 
Would not look forward to making any calls to Sony for tech help as past contacting
them proved very unpleasant. This is reason for the four star rating vs a five star.
Service from Amazon was All (5) Star Plus.

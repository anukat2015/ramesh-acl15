Title: Temperature sensor completely unreliable
Content:
I purchased 4 of these for my house and each of them had the same problem.  The automatic temperature sensor simply did not work.  So the heater would sense that it was cold and turn itself on for literally 30 seconds and then turn off.  And then a couple of minutes later, it'll go on for 30 seconds and then turn off.  Kept waking me up in the middle of the night.
Stay away from this product.

Title: Not so hot
Content:
Unit works well. Controls are simple, easy to set, but a remote control would be a seriously good addition. I'm using it in a large, draughty room, and it's inadequate, in spite of being labelled a "Large Room" heater. I also think the heat would be more efficient if it came out nearer to the floor, instead of on top. And the adjustable air flow louvre will not direct the air flow low enough to blow on the cold, cold floor. I just can't imagine what makes this heater so bloody large. I have other, smaller, less expensive heaters that put out just as much heat. It doesn't take up much floor space. It's just so tall! Overall, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just too expensive, and not warm enough for the size.

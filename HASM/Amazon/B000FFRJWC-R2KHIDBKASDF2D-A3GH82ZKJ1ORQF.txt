Title: Not a vacuum for mothers
Content:
I am not a mother, but I know that this vacuum is not for them or others who don't have a lot of time.  On carpet, it works quite well, but 90% or so of my house is tile and it doesn't pick up on tile worth a bean.  It's sucking power really isn't that strong, despite cleaning the filters and having the floor setting on the lowest setting it refuses to pick up cat litter or anything that might even resemble it.  The beater bar of the machine never turns off, so when I go over the tile it just flings things back out all over the room and I have to go over the same spots multiple times.  It's a pain.  However, I do like the round handle; it's great for lugging it up the stairs.  I bought this vacuum on clearence so I can't complain too much, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I'll keep it for what little carpet I have, but I've begun the new tile vacuum hunt.

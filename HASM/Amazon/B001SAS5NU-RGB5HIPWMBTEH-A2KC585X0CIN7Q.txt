Title: Lives up to expectations
Content:
I was tired of the cheap vacuums that die every two years and the last year you want to just chuck it out the door because performance just fades. Wanted to try Dyson because reviews were great & heard it could go from carpet to hardwood very easily. 
This one does not disappoint. Suction is incredible. The first time I ran it, I was disgusted with what came out of my carpet. Dust, dog hair, etc.. (& did I mention I had just run my old POS vacuum right before?), this thing can pick up anything & everything. Another great feature is that with a touch of a button on the powered head, you can shut off the beater bar/brush head so you can use the same head to go right to hardwood, tile, etc.. It does come with a hardsurface vacuum head that does work just fine, but why bother changing a head if you don't have to.
I have been using this vacuum for about a month & absolutely love it. The only drawbacks I have run into is the power cord is a bit short, ~15'. Also, when you want to use the crevice tool, matress attachment, or the 'fuzzy snout', it attaches to the colapsed wand which is ~2' long. It takes a little getting used to not having your attachments right at the end of a flexible hose, but neither one of these are even close to dealbreakers. Other than that, this vacuum is FANTASTIC! Cannot say enough about how easy it is to use, store, & empty the canister. I love not having to buy bags or filters. If you are thinking about this product, stop thinking & get it.

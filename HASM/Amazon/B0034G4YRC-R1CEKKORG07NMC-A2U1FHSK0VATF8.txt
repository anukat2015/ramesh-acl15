Title: great computer
Content:
The Gateway NV7922u laptop is an excellent computer for the price.  You get an I5 processor and 500 gb hard drive.  The laptop is lightweight, thin, solidly built and very fast, best of all is the 17.3 inch screen.  The keyboard is well designed with wide letters and it seems to run cool.  As other reviewers have said it is not designed for playing games but the graphics are good.  On the negative side the power lights in the lower left hand corner is a little annoying and it comes with very little documentation.  Once the power button is found on the right side of the computer it powers up easily and wireless connections are identified right away.  You can't currently get a better computer for the price.

Title: Perfect for 2
Content:
This is a nice, reasonably priced coffee maker. It makes enough coffee for my husband and myself without a lot of wasted coffee. The programmable function, auto shut off, and permanent filter are all nice features.
I remember that other reviewers commented on drips. However, I've noticed that happens w/ other coffee makers, too, and I think it's just a matter of pouring slowly when the carafe is full.
The reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is two-fold: (1) it makes a good cup of coffee, but it could probably be more flavorful; and (2) the structure of the machine looks a bit shoddier than how it's depicted in the picture (a sort of flimsy-ish plastic).
Overall, this is a great coffee maker for one or two people, and a good value.

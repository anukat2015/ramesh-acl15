Title: from coffee maker to microwave
Content:
I bought this coffee maker for my mom for Chirstmas.  I liked that it had a thermal carafe, because I thought she would be able to have hot coffee all day.  Wow, was I wrong.  She had to put the very first cup of coffee in to the microwave to warm up the coffee before she could even start drinking it.  The coffee was lukewarm from the start.  We returned the coffee maker.

This vacuum by far is the best vacuum I have ever owned for under $349.  The suction power is bar none the best I have ever utilized and could not believe the amount of dirt I suctioned up out of my carpet fibers.  I previously owned the Kenmore Guacomole and Torchlite and neither could come close to the quality and power of this one. I have a buhdist palm statue and this vacuum lifted it off the floor! I have found that bags were hard to find but found an online vendor at reasonable prices.  Also the hepa filter is pricy but I substituted with a hepa filter from home depot and cut to size to save big money!!! The attachments work great on unit and my favorite one is the crevice tool for couches and chairs.(My roomate has a dog and it picks up the hair great.  The only thing I wish I would have done was to have bought it through amazon.  I could have saved over a $100.  Highly reccomend for Chicago High Rise condo living as it is also very quiet unit and will not disturb roomates or neighbors.

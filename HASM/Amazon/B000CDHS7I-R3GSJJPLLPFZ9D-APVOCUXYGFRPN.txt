Title: Very poor design
Content:
The pot spout was designed by the dribble cup inventor.  When filling the tank, it is impossible to get the water into it without spilling water on the counter.  The shape of the spout is what causes the problem.
If you like luke warm coffee as my wife does, you will love this machine.  When I read the instructions to determine where there may be a temperature adjustment, they say to heat the pot by filling it with very hot water and rinsing it before starting the brew!  I have to do this every time I make coffee just to avoid a tepid cup.  They know this is a serious problem yet attempted to fix the poor design with consumer intervention.
I bought this because it had good reviews and came from a good manufacturer.  Krups needs to remove this from the market.

Title: Great for a HOT cup of coffee
Content:
We are so pleased that this coffeemaker actually makes and keeps our coffee hot.  We purchased a cheaper look-alike version of this - it even came with a thermal pot - and after the first cup, the coffee was never hot.  The carafe does not drip when coffee is poured.  The only complaint is one that I read on other reviews - it is a little difficult to see the water measurement markings.  I need to make sure the light is right over the coffeemaker.  For the great, hot cup of coffee that this coffeemaker provides, I'll live with that little inconvenience.

Title: perfect laptop?YES!!!!!!
Content:
I'm doing this review on the apple macbook pro 15.4inch laptop 2.5ghz,250gb hd,2gb ram
i'm broken this review down into 8parts about pros and i'll try to think about some cons along the way.
1.)performance-this computer is just as fast as a ferrari compared to my dell desktop that was bought in '01.hmm,did i say ferrari i meant space shuttle, this laptop's graphics card has 4x more r.a.m. than the dell desktop.i use it for hi def movie editing,call of duty 4(maxed out!),making a photo album in iphoto and school work.your thinking one at a time,hahahahahaha,this laptop does everything at the same time...and spaces makes it easier..thanks apple for leopard the world's most stable and best operating system. 
2.)screen-as you must know the screen is 15.4inches of pure delight,the l.e.d.'s(light emmiting diodes) make the screen pop out to get you.when i close the lid for it to sleep it goes to sleep instantly,and when i'm ready to use it,i just pop the lid and voila it's up and ready for another day's work.although the screen is slightly better in the new unibody one's,there is alot of reflection in direct sun and to have a computer and worry about reflection is the last thing i wana do.
3.)keyboard-talk about super sexy.i don't know about other people but i just love the keyboard and i'll get to the backlit part soon.the keys are silver and crisp.i love how it feels so solid and how it blends in with the whole elegant design of this computer.now the backlit,personally i think most people buy it cuz you need to use it a dark environment but i loved it for eye-candy.although,mostimes i needed it, i really love how it looks and i travel alot so in the night on those planes it's nice.and if you want someone to look at your laptop on those planes,trust me take this baby out and it will work it's majic.At a library,people watch you,watch your laptop and watch you again...it's really good.
4.)trackpad and button-the trackpad is good.just enough friction.not much to say about it and the button is really easy cuz although it looks really hard to click on it,lol,it actually isn't.
5.)battery life-okay,i love this battery life cuz i squeezed 3hours and 49minutes out of hit on heavy usage and screen full brightness.so about 4- 4and one half hours on average usage.it does suprisingly satisfy me on 9hour trips to england from where i am.i play call of duty on the planes and i squeeze about 4hours out of this,so i am satisfied...battery life is not a thing to worry about.
6.)the isight camera is surprisingly clear,cuz i chat with my friends regularly and they ask me where i got my webcam and i laugh at them...so no worries here.
7.)the heat-i know people who have been rerading alot of reviews on it hear the heat situation.these models don't get as hot on heavy usage...don't put it on your lap though..it won't feel to nice if you put it on your lap though.but on average usage it's quite fine.*only con*
8.)graphics card-the nvidia geforce 8600gt with 512mb of ram is glorious.i can play call of duty 4modern warfare maxed out and crysis on high with no glitches and this is a laptop so this rocks
                               Mac vs pc
you might notice that most windows laptops have 4gb ram and 320gbhd and 2.0ghz and cost $800 and this laptop has 2.5ghz,2gb ram and 250gb hd and cost $1650 is because i heard the ram in macs compared to pc laptops are 2 and one half times better.so if your mac has 2gb ram you get 5gb and indows have like 1.75 ram.
but in the end and this will hopefully always be that mac is way better than windows especially vista...this is my word,if you dont want to buy a mac fine but just buy xp dont buy vista.but leopard rocks =]

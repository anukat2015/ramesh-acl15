Title: First DSLR - LOVE it
Content:
I ordered this DSLR after reading a lot of reviews online and going to the store to hold it and compare to Nikons in the same price range.  I like the way the Canon felt better when I held it.  I like the 9 focus points of this one, and the 12.2 mp.  I am just a beginner, but this camera has made it so fun to learn how to use.  I highly recommend it!!!  It takes amazing pictures!

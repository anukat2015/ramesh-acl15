Title: Awesome machine!
Content:
After reading all the reviews (pro and con) I felt this was the vacuum I was looking for for my wood floors. With two parrots I needed something I could maneuver easily in a small room under cages and up walls. This little vacuum handles the task great! And the cord is long enough so I can continue into other rooms without unplugging constantly. The suction is quite good and the filter is a big plus. This is a really good machine.

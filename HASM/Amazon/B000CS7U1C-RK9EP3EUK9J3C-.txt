Title: My honest opinion...
Content:
Don't worry, I'm not a nine year old who just got this and just thinks it's awesome. I'm almost 13 and know more about computers than most adults. Music is my life, I love it. And I wanted the best mp3/video player out there. I didn't really want an iPod; I heard the battery isn't that great and it felt really wide and too think in my hand. Anyways, everything about this mp3 player is great. It looks pretty ugly in the picture, but looks better in person. The screen is great, I love watching movies on it. It is kinda bulky, but I don't mind much, especially while I'm watching Law & Order. The only reason why I'd ever get an iPod is to download all of the Law & Order episodes easily. My pictures look great and the music is awesome. I use Napster, and it's all quite easy to use. I've even been able to put album art on it using Windows Media Player. For the tech geek, this is a must-have. The only thing I don't like is how easily it gets scratched. It's horrible. But you can't notice them while you're watching something. Hopefully, ZENcast will start soon, then I'd be set.

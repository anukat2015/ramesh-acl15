Title: Love it !
Content:
My kids love the cocoa maker. It's so easy for them to make a cup of hot cocoa. They throw in a couple packs of hot chocolate mix, pour in the milk, turn it on and in minutes it's ready for them. I love that it will turn off then in a couple minutes turn on again to heat up your cocoa.

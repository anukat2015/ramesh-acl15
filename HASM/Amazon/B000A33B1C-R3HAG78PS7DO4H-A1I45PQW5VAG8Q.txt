Title: Fantastic Heater!!
Content:
I was skeptical about buying this heater since we have cathedral ceilings with an open kitchen/living room area... No problems for Delonghi!  We bought model TRD0715TL, it heats both rooms like a champ.  Set up in between the two rooms near the entry door... it gives a nice steady, even heat. It's sooo nice walking in from the cold to instant heat.  It's a very nice looking unit too.  
The timer is very easy to set up but you have to remember to reset it if the unit is turned off/unpluged.  We liked it so much we purchased another.  :o)  Highly recommended!

Title: Best Laptop for its price
Content:
This Macbook is amazing in two different ways, one of which pc laptops have not really emulated yet.
1. Very advanced laptop. You can read about the specs on your own, but you can do whatever you need to do on this laptop. Amazing trackpad (it's so addictive).
2. Arguably the best laptop case out in the market. Seriously. Solid aluminum, pleasing to the eyes, durable (won't mess up like plastic), etc
Everything about this laptop is perfect. If you can afford it, GET IT!!!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

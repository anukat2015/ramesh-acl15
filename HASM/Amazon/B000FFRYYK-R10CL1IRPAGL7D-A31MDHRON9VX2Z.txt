Title: Wish it were better/update
Content:
update.......I traded my first Bunn machine after all the dripping and noise and started fresh with another.
After two weeks the dripping began again...but now I will try the Dawn trick and let you know how it works out. 
Also I learned a valuable lesson. This machine can collect huge amounts of sediment from the water. When I was cleaning out my first machine before returning it, the bottom layer of the water I dumped from the resevoir was thick and milky. It took a bit of work to get all that out. This is probably why the machine was so noisy and shorted out my circuit...it had to heat the water through all the minerals collected.
Now I am careful to empty out the whole thing once a month and do the entire refill process again.
I also had a problem with the water sometimes pouring through before I closed the lid. I found that if I lifted the little white thing up, the pre-dripping stopped. After doing this a few times, I no longer am experiencing this problem.
*****************************************
This machine brews a great cup of coffee...hot and quick.  I've used it daily for about four months and am starting to get annoyed with a few glitches.  
1. When pouring hot coffee, the pot tends to spill or dribble unless you pour at the perfect speed.  I can do it, but my co-workers can't.  It has become their habit to pour a cup of coffee over a trash bag to catch the dribbles.  
2. The insulated pot does not keep the coffee reasonable warm for very long.  If coffee is made at 8:00, by 10:30 we are warming it in the microwave.  
3.  Recently, the water warming mechanism has become noisy when it first reheats the water.
Had I paid $25 for the pot, or if these things happened after owning the pot for a couple years, I probably wouldn't care.  But considering the price and the brand, these are details one shouldn't have to contend with.

Title: Good things come in small packages.
Content:
I purchased this heater about three or four years ago. It has worked trouble-free since then. It is compact for easy storage when the weather is warm, and it works very well for heating a small to medium-sized room.
It has a cut-off switch, if it's accidentally turned over, and it has a variable heat knob with a thermostat. It is also possible to run the fan without any heat, for simple air-circulation -although my Vornado fan does a better job.
I must admit that if I had read a couple of the previous reviews of this product before I actually bought it, I might have been worried and maybe not have purchased it. But my heater has worked perfectly with many, many hours of continuous use. So, I highly recommend it.
As for company customer service, I have no idea because I haven't had to contact the company for any reason.
Just one person's experience. I hope this helps.

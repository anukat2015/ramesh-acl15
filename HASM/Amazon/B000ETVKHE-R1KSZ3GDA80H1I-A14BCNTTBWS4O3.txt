Title: expandibility is a plus
Content:
I have had the 2 MB version of this unit for a year and recently bought my son this one. The reason that I love it so much is the expandibility factor. You can easily add a Micro SD disk in it and immediately have another batch of songs added. This is great when I put my holiday music on the extra chip and only play that during the holiday season. I also love the shuffle feature and that you can create lists from the WMP and move the lists over to it. Put your faves in a list and only play them if you so desire. You can also buy a car adapter that works through the car adapter and radio. When it is plugged in, it charges the Sansa as it is playing. I believe the adapter is by Griffin. (It does have a numeric display of the radio stations and you have to put the car on the same station.)

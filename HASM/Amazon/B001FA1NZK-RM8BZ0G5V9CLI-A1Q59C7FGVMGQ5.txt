Title: My Little Friend
Content:
Lets put this in the right light of day, I am 63 years old and just entered the world of G3,I-pods and other such gismos.
My first experiance was last months purchase of a 4th generation i-pod Nano, which died on me after a week, no to be put off I desided on the touch, glad I did it is fantastic in every way. It is true you get what you pay for good price quality product,that has everything and more,I'm happy. Buy one you won't regret it.

Title: Great for RV's
Content:
I purchased this heater for our RV about 2 years ago.  We have a 25 foot class C.  We camp in snow country and this little heater keeps the chill off when we are sleeping.  I love the thermostat option.  When we are sitting around the table playing games, it keeps the RV toasty warm.  I'm going to purchase one for our home.  I'm so impressed how a heater this small can keep you so warm.  It's held up great so far.  We do use it 24/7 when we are camping . I would highly recommend it.

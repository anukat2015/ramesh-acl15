Title: Not worth it if you are doing carpet!
Content:
I just got home with my new vacuum.  What a disappointment!  I am returning it tomorrow.  Although this machine is very cool looking, and easy to empty, albeit easy to make a mess if you hit the button too soon, the suction was horrible with the power head on.  It works great with the smaller accessories, but there aren't enough brushes, and there is no pile adjustment for the power head.  I had to go over several areas 4 and five times, and it still never picked up some visible paper on the rug.  It worked fine on the hardwoods, but not at all on the carpet.  Also, it doesn't even give you any vacuum lines that we all love.  I am returning this tomorrow, and looking elsewhere.

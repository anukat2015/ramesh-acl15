Title: IPOD Who?
Content:
I bought this player primarily for use with the Rhapsody online musc service which allows you to "rent" the music and transfer it to your mp3 player so long as you have a valid subscription.
I'm very happy with this device, though there are several things that you should consider before making a  purchase.
PROS
-Works nicely with Rhapsody
-Nice battery life - I haven't had to worry about running out of power
CONS
-FM Tuner requires presetting - cannot manually tune a channel
-I found audio book programs (such as from Nightingal Conant) had annoying pauses between tracks
-As others have pointed out, this device requires a separate converter to connect to the charger or USB port -- a MAJOR WEAKNESS and perhaps the only thing that would make me decide not to re-purchase.
Overall I like the long battery life and the player also supports video which I've used several times and love (it's especially great on long airline flights).

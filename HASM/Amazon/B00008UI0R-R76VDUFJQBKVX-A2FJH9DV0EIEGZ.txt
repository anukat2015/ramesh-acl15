Title: Great Vac at any price....
Content:
I have owned several vacuums during the past 25 years some were better than others, but only one ever came close to this one (and it cost substantially more money) Light weight, easy to manuever powerful little vac loaded with options and accessories. Before making the purchace I did my homework and checked out a lot of vacuums in the $200 - $300 range and this one had the best mix of features vs cost. You can imagine how happy I was to find it here at Amazon for a much lower price than advertised elsewhere.
I knew a Hoover would never let me down, I have everything I want in a compact canister vac, including HEPA filtering without the costly Hepa replacement cartridges and bagless convenience! Thanks Hoover and thank you Amazon!

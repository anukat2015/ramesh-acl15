Title: Still a solid and impressive camera in 2009.
Content:
Why should you purchase this older canon model?
~ It still takes great quality photographs, and at 8.2 megapixels, it still large enough to produce 24x30 inch image or even a little larger.
~You can find the 20D on amazon or other classifieds for 400 dollars or cheaper, and amazing price for an SLR body!
~I've owned this camera for over 4 years now, and it's NEVER let me down. Canon builds quality cameras, and despite me dropping it, taking it out in frigid weather, its barely shown signs of wear.
~This camera still out-preforms newer nikon cameras in the realm of sport photography. It can snap off a burst of at least 20 photos in a couple seconds. I use it for hockey, football, soccer, you name it!
~Be sure to check the sensor every so often for dust, I try to clean mine once a month or so to keep photos looking crisp and colorful.
~Great in-camera settings (called parameters in the menu) let you control contrast, sharpness, saturation, and also control b&w or color modes. You get much better results doing it in-camera than in photoshop.
~If you're looking to "go professional" and buying an SLR, but don't want to drop 900+ dollars on a canon rebel, try the 20D. It's an amazing camera!

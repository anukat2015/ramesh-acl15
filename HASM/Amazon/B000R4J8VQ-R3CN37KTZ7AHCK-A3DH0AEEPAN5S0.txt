Title: Cheap, great coffee
Content:
I bought this thing at Target last Winter for about $19. It has a flimsy, plastic build, and is a little messy to clean up. But, the coffee that this thing makes is really, really good.  I have a manual pump espresso machine, an Aeropress, and about a half-dozen drip,  pour-over, or pod (pump) coffee makers.  This little one is what I use to make most of my coffee. In fact, after getting this little thing, I threw a couple of my drip coffee makers away (only keeping one for when company comes). 
Grind it fine and use a liberal amount of coffee with about 8 oz of water (Don't be tempted to make two cups at a time).  Or, use 4 oz of water and cut the result with 4 oz of boiling (or near boiling) water after it finishes.  It won't disappoint you.

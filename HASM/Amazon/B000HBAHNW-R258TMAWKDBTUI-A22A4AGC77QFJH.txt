Title: Excellent with One Reservation
Content:
I just tested out the Callisto model Miele in my home.  It is an exceptionally well-built and quiet vacuum.  It was a dream to use on hardwood floors.  My only reservation about it is that it hurt my wrist to vacuum on carpet.  I intend to try a Miele with a power head next to see if it is easier to maneuver.

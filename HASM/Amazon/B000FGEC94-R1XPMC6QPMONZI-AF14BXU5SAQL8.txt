Title: Great Product!!!!!
Content:
I just wish it had more space than 2GB.  That is the only short coming in my opinion.  And also the fact that you need to download a video converter from Iriver just to transfer you video files too. Besides those 2 aspects, this is one of THE BEST MP3 Players I've ever purchased. I sold my Ipod NANO as soon as I discovered the CLIX.

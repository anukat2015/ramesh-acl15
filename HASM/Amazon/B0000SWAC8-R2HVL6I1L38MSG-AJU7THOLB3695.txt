Title: Shoddy consctruction
Content:
Attractive design, compact, quiet, efficient, versatile. BUT the electrical connection from body to carpet brush is flimsy. It failed once (just out of warranty of course) and now it's failing again. I won't get it fixed and I won't buy another [Eureka] Electrolux.

Title: Nice Appearance, Poor Construction, and Good Coffee
Content:
My wife and I selected the Krups FME-4 coffee maker to replace the Braun KF550-BK model we've used for the last 2 years.  The Braun was, and still is, an excellent machine.  But it lacked a timer, which the Krups has.
The Krups has a good clock/timer system that can be a little confusing, unless you read the manual (self-explanatory).  The display uses an LCD that can be difficult to view from some angles.  Overall, it works okay.
The construction of the Krups is what bothers me the most.  My Braun coffee maker has a filter holder that can stand upright on the counter while I'm filling it with grounds.  This is really useful.  Unfortunately, the filter holder for the Krups is not designed to stand on a counter, so I have to replace it in the coffee maker unit or hold it with my free hand while adding grounds.  This is a big annoyance.
Also, the review that mentions the uselessness of the water-level indicator on the side of the unit is completely accurate.  Bubbles form in the indicator, making it impossible to read.  Few things bother me as much as a feature that looks great on the packaging, and that's all.
Regarding the carafe, yes, it does spill; but, only if you try to pour too fast.  I had the same problem with my Braun, and just backing off on the angle of the carafe while pouring is enough to keep the coffee in the cup.
Overall, there are some critical design flaws that really shouldn't be present in such a frequently used product; but, it makes good coffee and is fairly simple to use.  In hindsight, I might have instead bought the Braun KF580-BK, which is identical to my current model plus a clock/timer.

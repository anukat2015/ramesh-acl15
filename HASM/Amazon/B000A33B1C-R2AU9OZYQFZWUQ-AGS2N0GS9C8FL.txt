Title: Very good
Content:
I bought a oil-filled radiator because I have cat (not dangerous for them). Oveall, I am very satisfied. I have a very large bedroom and it manages to heat the whole thing pretty well. It's safe, does not make noise at all, and no smell here (only at the beginning). It's easy to use, though I haven't figured out how to use the timer and from what I gathered, it makes a lot of noise so won't be using that. I am very satisfied and would recommend that oil-filled heaters anytime, mine in particular.

Title: Very convienient
Content:
good coffee, no mess, lots of variety
easy to make/grind your own beans with the k-cup ( you should use the modification and cut out an old use k-cup and place it in the tub to keep the water seaping a little bit longer.)  Also you can re-use old k-cups about5-6 times with your own grinds.  Both has been explained in the older reviews and works well for people who like stronger cups!

Title: Good for small rooms
Content:
I use this heater occasionally to heat up the bathroom before  a shower, or for extra heat in my small, home office on particularly cold, windy days.  I have found the heater to be well-built and dependable.  Because the heater doesn't blast out hot air, it's perfect for small spaces.  My old heater put out more hot air with more force, but it didn't seem as safe, and I often felt like I was being 'toasted' on one side.  I prefer the even heat of the honeywell.
Two cons: I wish there was a grip or handle on the top, so it could be easily moved.  I also don't like the placement of the air-intake slots.  Air goes into the heater right above the dish shaped base, and if any dust or hair has collected in the 'dish,' it gets sucked into the heater and stinks.  So it's important to make sure that the base is dust-free before turning on the heater.

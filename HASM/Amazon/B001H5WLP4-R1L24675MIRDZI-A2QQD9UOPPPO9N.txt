Title: Good mp3 player
Content:
I bought this for my little brother to bring on the bus on his was to and from school.  So far it has been great.  It is simple to use.  He has music and several pictures on it(We have not tried the video yet).  The charge lasts pretty long as he listens to it probably for about an hour a day and it only needs to be charged once a week at the most.  The quality of the pictures is not as good as an Ipod so I'm assuming the video quality isn't quite as good either, but for about 1/5th the price you can't complain.  I would recommend this product, especially if you are buying it primarily for music.

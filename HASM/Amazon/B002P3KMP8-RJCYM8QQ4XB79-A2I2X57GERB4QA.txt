Title: Great value alternative to MacBook Pro series
Content:
At around $800 for a 15 inch, this laptop undercuts the Apple Macbook Pro by about half.  It is thin and light and with great decent build quality.  The multi touch mouse is a little too sensitive but I believe with the correct collaboration, it can be easily fixed.  The screen is bright with the LED backlighting.  The battery in real life test lasted me about 8-9 hours while surfing the internet.  There are additional features which I have yet to masters like smart login with camera.  All in all, very satisfied with the purchase.  The only thing I found a bit disappointing is that one of the rubber thingies that hides the screw already came off on day two.  It does not impact the performance in anyway but it's a bit disappointing.  Also there are alot of screw points around the monitor as well which was a bit of a surprise.  The 15.6" widescreen is a bit non standard and cannot fit into my LV messenger bag.  Windows 7 64 bit requires a bit of adjustments to work with older apps.  But other than that, this is a beautiful, FAST, LIGHT alternative to the MacBook Pro.

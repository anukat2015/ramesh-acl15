Title: could use one improvement
Content:
I bought this heater because my friend has the identical one and it impressed me.  It does a great job of heating my much larger than average bedroom.  the unit itself shows the room temperature and the temperature you are setting, as well as the mode (fan, low, high).  These readings are on the top of the unit, so unless you are right there, directly looking down, you can't see them.  So for example, if it is on the floor and you are sitting just a few feet away, you can no longer see the settings.  (And it works so well, if you have the temp set a degree to high, you will quickly regret it.) 
Another problem is the remote only offers controls to let you turn on and off and raise or lower the temperature or change mode.  On the remote you can't see what temp you are setting or which mode you are in.  I have a portable fan with a remote that show all the information shown on the unit, and that works much better.  If, like me, you use the heater where you can't see it's display and will mostly use the remote, you might want to see if there's one with a more intelligent remote.
But other than that, it is great at heating up a room, and since it has a thermostat, you don't need to deal with constantly adjusting it once the room gets warmed up, or through the night as the outside temperature changes.

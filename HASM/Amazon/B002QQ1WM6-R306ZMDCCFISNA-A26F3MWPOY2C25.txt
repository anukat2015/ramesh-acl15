Title: Great computer for your money
Content:
Bought this laptop as a larger screen product for my home network and I am very pleased.  Better than the Sony we have and egual to a Toshiba I use at work.  You get a ton of features for your $$$. Only thing I would ask for is a better paper manual which explains all of the features.  Overall I am very happy weth this product.

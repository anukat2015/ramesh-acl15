Title: Its ok...for the price.
Content:
I purchased the honeywell heater because I saw a review of it in Consumer Report magazine. They listed it as a great buy that was safe, efficient, easy to use and great on energy costs.
The first night i plugged it in, it heated my bedroom, which is about the size of a small office. It heated it up in about a half hour, but nothing too hot to where we wanted to turn it off. 
I then took it downstairs to heat the living room and dining area, which didn't do so well. It took about an hour before the chill actually took out of the room.
I also received my electric bill the other day. HEART ATTACK!!! My energy cost has almost doubled! 
However, it is VERY quiet, but its large and can get in your way if you do not push it up against a wall. It is also very easy to use and looks pretty safe, after all, it doesn't quite get hot enough to catch anything on fire :)

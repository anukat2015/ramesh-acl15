Title: dehumidifier requires constant drainage!
Content:
i love this unit- it is cool and quiet- but when the A/C is running, at least in Boston, apparently the water can't evaporate fast enough and so it fills every 2-3 hours! the "water full" light blinks and the a/c turns off until you manually release the water from the little tube at the bottom of the unit, 1" off the floor, so it is impossible to even get a bottle under it to catch it! i have started letting the water drain into a cookie sheet, because that's the only thing that can fit under the tube and hold the amount of water that drains. i've been in contact with soleus to ask their advice, and have gotten generic and useless responses. also, since i have opened the box i cannot return the item to the origional seller! i was trying to get a MORE convienient A/C, but it is also very large and the tubes are huge. also, the cord is only 6 feet long, though mine seems to be okay on an appliance extension cord. sigh. now i wish i had just gotten 2 cheaper ones for my windows instead of this huge dripping one. but my room is fresh and cool- for an hour at a time...

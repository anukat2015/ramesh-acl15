Title: This series is frought with problems
Content:
I have had this series of DV9000 with the same features since March '07.  Just 3 months after the initial 2 year warranty period ([...]) the optical drive failed.  Also, HP recalled my computer due to a display hinge problem, which I had to send to them for repair for 2 weeks.  Just one month after I received my repaired computer, the motherboard fried.  One minute it was working, the next minute it was blank and unresponsive.  HP wants another $[...] for this- clearly not worth the money to fix it.  If you don't mind spending over a thousand dollars on a 2 year old "disposable" electronic device, than go for it.  I have NEVER traveled with this laptop.  The furthest is has moved is upstairs and downstairs in my home, yet it had multiple issues and a catastrophic failure just after 2 years.  My computer technicians said that the series is frought with problems, and recommended not fixing it (contrary to their business interest in fixing it).  Many of the computers in the DV9000 line were recalled due to a motherboard failure- though mine is "not one of them" according to HP.  Dealing with HP is a NIGHTMARE as well.  They make a lot of promises with ZERO follow through.  Their customer service is reprehensible.
If you DO decide to buy an HP- use your Amex card.  American Express adds an additional year beyond the manufacturer warranty to any electronic device you purchase via their card.  I have been pleasantly surprised that they have been handling this PC issue wonderfully, and have promised to either repair or replace it. I will not be replacing it with another HP- of any kind or series.

Title: Great cup of Coffee
Content:
Have been through several coffee makers, this one makes a very good cup of coffee.  I went through 2 or three Mr. Coffee's and was not happy with the brew of any of them.  The Mr. coffee's have some nice features that make filling simpler than the Cuisinart, but do not compare on the brew. I was very surprised at how quickly I received the Cuisinart DCC-1200, thank you.

Title: Outstanding Heater
Content:
This heater is *not* designed to heat a whole room.  Instead it is designed to heat the occupant of the room.  It's parabolic design provides a great deal of directed heat.  From 8 to 10 feet away, the heater keeps a person comforfortably warm.  We have a family room that sits on a concrete slab and has 3 outside walls... it's difficult to heat the entire room even with radiators, baseboard heaters etc. and turning up the heat in the house makes the rest of the house too hot.  The heatdish allows our family to watch TV in comfort without having to heat the whole room.

Title: I like my new coffeemaker
Content:
This is a nice, good quality machine. It makes good coffee, and has all the necessary controls needed, short of grinding. 
It is faster than cheap (Walmart type) coffeemakers, that I have always had before. 
I need a 12 cup, so that's a plus. 
My only problem with it, is filling it, since I am short, and this sits on the counter, so it's a bit of a trick filling the water reservoir. 
But, to get around part of that, I just use a measuring cup to fill and make sure I'm getting the desired amount of water. 
We have a water filter on our sink, so I'm not using the supplied filter. 
I tried the basket for the ground coffee, and prefer store bought disposable filters, because there is less sediment in the brewed coffee.
It seems to be a quality product, and I will look for Cuisinart products in the future as I need them.

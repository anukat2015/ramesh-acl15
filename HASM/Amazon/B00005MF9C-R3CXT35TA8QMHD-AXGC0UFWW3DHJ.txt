Title: great cup, maker had problems
Content:
It makes a great cup of coffee when it wants to.  Often there was up to 1/2" of water in water tank after making a cup of coffee. this extra water would appear in next cup .. sometimes over flowing the cup or just messing up the desired strength of coffee.
The number is the same, the reviews seem to be a better design than what I got, but same number.  go figure!
The travel cup was great, no bad plastic taste .. no drip when drinking.  
The cost of this now is nice .. I paid Amazon $68 in Dec'09.

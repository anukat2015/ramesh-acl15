Title: Get it in your hands
Content:
Like others I spent a long time reading and discussing the benefits of a DSLR. Now I have a D80 I would urge everyone to avoid entry models and get your options in your hands before making a decision. Wanting to take pics of family, wildlife and sporting events and avoid lots of lens changing made the 18-200mm a no brainer. After a month I can say the research was worth it and pics in RAW are significantly better than jpeg it reminds me of when I first heard CD v vinyl.Buying on Amazon was the best deal and faultless delivery.

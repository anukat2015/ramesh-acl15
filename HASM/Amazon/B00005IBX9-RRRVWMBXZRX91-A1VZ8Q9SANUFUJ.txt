Title: Best darn coffee maker ever
Content:
My Husband and I registered for this coffee maker for our wedding.  Honestly, I couldn't wait until my shower to get it, and ended up going out and buying it myself as soon as it went on sale ($80, minus 20% off coupon!)  My husband and I LOVE it.  the carafe is nicely heavy, but not so heavy that you break your writs trying to pur a cup of coffee in the morning.  It has a nice array of bells and whistles if you're onto adjusting the temperature of teh warming pad and such.  We just set it for the middle and left it alone.  It has a very cool look about it too...a little retro in it's overall design.  It cleans nicely with stainless steel cleaner....for those who complain about how difficult it is to clean, they need to invest in the proper cleaner...stainless steel appliances come with a price for their overall look!!  We've had ours for at least a year now, and we haven't had to replace the charcoal filter yet.  There's a handy little reminder light that's supposed to come on when it's time for that.  It's really easy to use,as long as you can read the booklet that comes along.

Title: Superior build and excellent image quality
Content:
I upgraded from a 20D to the 50D and did not wait for the 5D2. As others have remarked, most 20D accessories will work with the 50D including flashes, batteries and remote triggers. 
My primary use is for aviation photography. This camera has quickly become the standard for sport shooting because of its fast (6.3 fps) shutter rate and large buffer. Unless you are using raw (recommended), you can shoot continuously with jpg. You need to be careful. With the 20D, it was easy to take single shots with the shutter in continuous shooting mode. With the 50D, the fast shutter will zip off numerous images with just a light touch.
The 1.6 crop factor works in my favor when shooting distant subjects, making a 400mm lens an effective 640mm. This has been an advantage for me even when using wider lenses. My 17-40L is fine for portraits on the long end at an effective 64mm. My 50mm 1.8 has produced some tack sharp images. Anyone who complains about this camera being "soft" has not been using quality glass. 
The high resolution screen is amazing. I am not a big chimper, but I do like to check my images and histogram from time to time, and to review them after a shoot. I have not been a big fan of liveview, but this camera has advanced face recognition in that mode that will come in handy for the times when you need to hand the camera to a novice so you can get in the picture.
The 40D had a build quality that was similar to my 20D but the 50D seems to be a step up with better weather sealing. Working outdoors around airport ramps, my cameras get some hard use. The 50D looks like it is up to that task.
Be prepared when you buy this camera for large file sizes. My shots have averaged 20mb for raw and 10mb for jpg. That will fill up your memory cards, and hard disks, in a hurry. For the wonderful images that this camera produces, that is a small trade-off.

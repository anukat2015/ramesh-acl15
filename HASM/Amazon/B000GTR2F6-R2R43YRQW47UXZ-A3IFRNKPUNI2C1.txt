Title: Life is too short to drink cheap coffee!
Content:
Once you get over paying $150-$200 for the coffee maker, you then need to wrestle with the cost of K-cups, which can range from 35 to 50 each. With that said, you can expect a same fresh brewed, consistently favorful cup of coffee each and every time. I've tried the Kona blend, Lake and Lodge, Breakfast blend, French Roast, Dark roast, and the hot chocolate. I can't say that I've been disappointed with any of those choices. The best part of owning a Keurig coffee maker is the first cup of coffee in the morning. It takes about 30 seconds to brew a cup, during which you get to enjoy the wonderful smell of fresh brewed coffee. This is certainly a luxury. But if you enjoy a fine cup of coffee and don't mind the cost, go ahead and indulge! You won't be sorry!

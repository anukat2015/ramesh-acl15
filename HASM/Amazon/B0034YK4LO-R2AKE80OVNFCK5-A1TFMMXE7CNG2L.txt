Title: LOVE IT and definitely recommend it!
Content:
This heater was recommended to me from a co-worker that purchased one and really liked it.  He did a lot of shopping around and felt that it was a great value compared to many other higher priced heaters.  I was more interested in how well it would work and I am very pleased.  I am using it in my finished basement and it is doing a great job of keeping the space at 71 degrees.  Normally, in order for me to get my basement comfortable, I have to turn my thermostat upstairs over 75 degrees.  This has always been a problem, and I would tend not to use the basement in the colder months.  This heater has completely solved my problem.

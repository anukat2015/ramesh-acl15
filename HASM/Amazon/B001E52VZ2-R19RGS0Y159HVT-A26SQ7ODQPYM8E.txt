Title: Poor suction and flimsy plastic material
Content:
I'm very disappointed by the Eureka 12 Amps Boss Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum Cleaner and don't understand why it gets these high ratings on here. When I bought this I knew it was not going to be the best vacuum cleaner because of the price, but the suction is so poor it is just worthless. It leaves most dirt behind because of its poor suction. The straight wand and floor nozzle are made of a very flimsy and light plastic material that make using it a real challenge. The floor nozzle has tiny plastic wheels that don't roll well on carpet. I've always had canister vacuum cleaners with metal wands and more substantial nozzles before this and I just don't understand why this company decided to make it plastic. I advise anyone to spend a little more on a better vacuum cleaner than this piece of junk. It is anything but 'mighty'.

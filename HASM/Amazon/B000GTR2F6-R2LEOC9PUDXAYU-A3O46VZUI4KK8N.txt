Title: Fast, Good Coffee - Love it.
Content:
I had purchased the B60 for my brother as a gift and after hearing (and trying) firsthand how awesome this machine is, I had to get one myself. I have a Breville espresso maker (which I love also) and really like the flavors and money savings of doing it myself. But (of course in my opinion) nothing beats the Keurig for a fast - really good cup of coffee or hot chocolate or tea!

Title: Good for a quick cleanup
Content:
I bought the Kurv because I needed a quick way to clean up after 4 kids without dragging out the vac system or broom after every snack, project, and meal. The Kurv is great for just that purpose and it's even easy for my 4 year old to use. Of course, if you want a thorough clean-up, you will have to use a full-sized vac. My only complaint is that you cannot set it on the counter as it will roll off. For quick jobs, the Kurv is great and it blends into my decor just fine.

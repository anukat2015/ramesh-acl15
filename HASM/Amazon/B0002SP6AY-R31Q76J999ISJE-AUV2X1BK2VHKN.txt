Title: Therostat Makes an Annoying Noise
Content:
This thermostat installs easily and functions as advertised.It does make a noise each time it turns the furnace on AND off. It is a clicking sound with a twang sound at the end. It is attention getting in a room with people in it. I talked to customer support and a technician at Hunter and they admit that this is a relay noise in this model thermostat. The thermostat that I was replacing was a 10+ year old Hunter digital unit that operated silently! The reason that I was replacing it was that it had a temperature span of 4 degrees and the new one has a span of 2 degrees and would make the house more comfortable. Hunter knows all of this. I don't know why they went backwords from solid state electronics to a mechanical relay (a poor one at that)! Also be wary of their ceiling fans! I have a 5 year old fan that runs quietly and two new ones that have a bothersome humming noise. Hunter sent me new fans and they do the same thing. This issue is currently pending with me and Hunter Tech support.

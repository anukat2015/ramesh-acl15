Title: Good for small rooms
Content:
I purchased this after reading reviews about how well it heats large spaces.
Well...not true.
My living room has 16 foot ceilings and is open to the foyer and kitchen. It never gets warm in the winter.
This heater does nothing to help with heating that room.   Not even a hint of heat, unless you sit on it.  
However, I did use it in the 12' x 12' den with the door closed, and it it heated that room up nicely.
Luckiy I heated it up in the garage for a few hours before doing indoors.   The initial smell was horrible. 
Will look into purchasing a radiant heater for the living room to give more direct heat.

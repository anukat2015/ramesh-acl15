Title: Fantastic
Content:
I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second. 
The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing.

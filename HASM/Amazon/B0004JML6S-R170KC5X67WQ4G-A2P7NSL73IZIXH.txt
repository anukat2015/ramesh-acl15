Title: Good Coffee From A Poorly Made Machine
Content:
The FME4-14 brews a nice cup of coffee, as should be the case from any coffee machine backed by Krups' reputation.  That's about all the compliment this machine can be given.
Problems: 
The "attached" lid makes cleaning the carafe an awkward affair.  It is ostensibly detachable, but the hinge feels far too flimsy to survive multiple removals.
The "auto stop" plunger on the filter holder barely works.  I've spilled many cups of coffee when removing the carafe before brewing is complete.
By default, the device beeps whenever brewing is complete.  Make it stop.
The whole apparatus for inserting/removing the charcoal filter is flimsy.  I broke it during initial setup of the machine -- and I was being as gentle as humanly possible.
Save your money.  Krups has made exceptional machines in the past, and I trust they will again one day.  In the meantime, look to the competition if you need a new coffee maker anytime soon.

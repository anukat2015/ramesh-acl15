Title: So far, so good!
Content:
I just purchased this and i am enjoying it so far.  I had some indecision early on because I couldn't decide between the model 3920 or the model 4104. My indecision was mostly because I couldn't figure out what the difference was. I know that some people in this forum suggest that model 4104 is newer and therefore is better.
So I contacted Bissell directly to clarify the difference. Here is what they wrote. I hope it helps clear up the confusion for anyone else that might be confused.

"Thank you for contacting BISSELL Consumer Services.
The model 4104 is exclusively sold at Wal-mart retail stores. This model does not come with the pet hair lifter feature like the model 3920.
The pet hair lifter is attached to the bottom of the machine, it works like a lint brush to gather more of the surface hair from the carpet.
Other than this, the machines are the same."

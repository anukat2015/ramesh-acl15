Title: Best 20 Bucks I've Ever Spent
Content:
Okay...so I'd have to think seriously for a minute about all the times I've spent 20 bucks on something, BUT....here it is April 2010 and I bought this heater in November 2009 ( for my first East Coast winter). Not only did it save my life throughout the freezing winter (some new yorkers say..'oh this was a mild winter'...I say...get over yourselves and stop being so tough. It was COLLLLLDDD especially for this California girl), but I'm sitting here in 'Spring', it's rainy and cold out and of course....my little heater is faithfully blazing away. It's doing such a good job in fact, that I thought to write a review 6 months later? You bet. I love it. I'm sitting here just admiring it doing its thing. Will it heat your whole house? No. Will it heat a bedroom, especially one the size found in typical NY apartments. Yes...and many times over. I heart Delonghi.

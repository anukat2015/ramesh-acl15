Title: Simply Awesome

Okay, when I saw this laptop in an ad, I instantly fell in love with its performance vs price.  It has the newest line of Intel CPU (the i3) and 4 GB of DDR3 RAM.  This thing screams for the $500 I paid for it.  
Win 7 gives the CPU a 6.2, which is by far the best laptop CPU I have owned.  The graphics rating is 4.6 (Aero) and 5.3 (Gaming).  Again, I have never had a laptop close to that.  As stated before, it still won't run Crysis very well, if at all, but your mainstream casual games, it will play with ease.
Pros: i3, 4 GB DDR3, it connects to my wireless at 300 mpbs!!!!  My new, as in got in in December, Acer Netbook, which claims to have N only connects at 54 mpbs, so when I saw that this one hit 300 mpbs, I about threw a party.  It has HDMI out, VGA out, and 4 USB ports.  Most 15.6" laptops only have 3 USB ports.
Cons: No Bluetooth, firewire, e-sata, and a 5400 RPM HDD.  For me, it doesn't really matter.  I have never had bluetooth, and never used firewire or e-sata, so it isn't like I will miss it.  While I make the 5400 RPM HDD a con, for the average user, you won't even notice a difference.  I have had laptops with both 5400 RPM and 7200 RPM HDDs and for everyday computing, which this thing is designed for, you will not notice a difference.
It has Intel Graphics, but they are considerably better than previous Intel graphics (again 4.6 and 5.3 experience ratings).  The 1366x768 resolution is low since I went from a desktop to this, but I will manage.
All in all, if you can get this laptop for $500 plus tax, BUY IT!  No other $500 laptop will touch it.  I am very pleased with my purchase.

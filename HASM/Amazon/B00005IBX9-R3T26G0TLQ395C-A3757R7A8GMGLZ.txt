Title: THIS IS THE BEST COFFEE MAKER! EXCELLENT HOT COFFEE EVERY TIME!
Content:
I had many unfortunate experiences with coffee makers (ranging from Mr. Coffee to Bunn) and could not understand why I could not get a good tasting hot cup of coffee with a machine that would not cost an arm and a leg in the price range of $100.00 or more. I remember when coffee makers cost $20.00-30.00, so the prices of many of the coffee makers I looked at were a surprise, to say the least (not to mention culture shock). However, in my quest for the best coffee maker, I found this Cuisinart Central Brew coffee maker. It is reasonably priced, makes good hot coffee and every pot is perfect. I especially like the timer feature on it, which gives me the added benefit of waking up to a hot pot of coffee in the morning, brewed before my alarm clock sounds. This coffee maker is the best value for the money and makes the best coffee (and hot too!). I would recommend the Cuisinart Brew Central coffee maker to anyone.  Good product, good price, good coffee!  Excellent!!  By the way, a friend has the stainless steel Cuisinart Brew Central coffee maker that grinds the coffee beans and she loves it. The one I purchased is not the stainless steel model and does not grind the coffee beans, but it is exactly what I wanted and I love this coffee maker (I didn't want the coffee bean grinder, stainless steel or thermal pot. Just a plain old glass pot for me.) I am glad Cuisinart gives you a choice and lets you pick out the coffee maker that is best for you, according to your taste. Take my advise and get a Cuisinart. You will be pleased and enjoy cup after cup of delicious hot coffee.

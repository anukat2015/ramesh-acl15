Title: As good as there is
Content:
We have gone through four cappuccino makers in the past several years and were very doubtful about this one but to our surprise it has performed brilliantly. We like our lattes and cappuccinos hot and this does the trick. We have, so far, tried Starbucks and Maxwell House and have been pleasantly surprised to find that Maxwell House is the choice of our three housemembers. And, at $6.17 for a 16 T Disk pack at Walmart, that ain't bad. We bought our machine at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $199 minus 20% and then minus a $50 rebate so for about $119 (incl tax) we got a deal. We have owned one much more expensive and a couple less expensive and feel this is the best of the lot. The only drawback is that if making more than one it does take a bit more time than we would like but, would we buy it again? You Bet!

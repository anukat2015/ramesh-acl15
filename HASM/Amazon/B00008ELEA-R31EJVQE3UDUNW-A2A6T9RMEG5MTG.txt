Title: Best Coffee Pot For Your Money
Content:
This is the best coffee pot for your money. I owned the same pot for 10 years so it was a no brainer to purchase another one.  The coffee pot brews a consistently hot, delicious cup of coffee.  My pot gets a work out day in an day out and never lets me down.  I have tried Mr. Coffee and Kuerig like systems and I didn't like the way they did not get the coffee hot enough.  You can adjust the amount of coffee in the Farberware to reach the brewed taste that suits you - weak, strong or in between.  Great coffee pot.

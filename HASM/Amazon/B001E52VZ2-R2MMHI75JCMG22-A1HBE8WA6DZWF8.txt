Title: I hate it
Content:
I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic, cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever, the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.  
I have a big dog, 2 cats, a baby, hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.
Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap.

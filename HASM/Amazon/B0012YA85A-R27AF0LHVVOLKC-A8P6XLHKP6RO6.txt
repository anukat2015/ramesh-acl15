Title: Canon Rebel
Content:
I took photography in college many, many years ago and decided recently that I wanted to start taking quality photographs again so I bought the Canon Rebel based on advice of a professional photographer. I have not been disappointed.  If you want to point and shoot the automatic features will allow you to do that.  If you don't, but want to make the adjustments yourself (the way it used to be done) then you can do that as well.  If the latter, the instruction book is very clear on how to do that even if you don't know about f stops, shutter and film speed.  The other features are amazing and I am really looking forward to using some of the advanced features.  So far, this has turned out to be a great purchase.

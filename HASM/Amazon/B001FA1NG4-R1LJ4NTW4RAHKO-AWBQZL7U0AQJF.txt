Title: ahem . why is everybody complaining about the coverflow thing???
Content:
you can turn off this feature if you want to.so you have to select music and then cover flow.love this ipod by the way.ive noticed that a lot of the itouch games could easily be played on the nano cuz it has the accelerometer and i think this could be a big selling point but s it is you can only play normal ipod games on it.with some differences like beig able to steer with the accelerometer in some racing games.

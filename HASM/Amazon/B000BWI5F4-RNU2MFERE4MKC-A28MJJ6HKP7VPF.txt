Title: overheating after little use
Content:
I share the frustrations of a previous reviewer who had or has the same problem with his 2222UC model. When I had a problem with the cord not rewinding automatically I sent it back to the dealer who sold it and it was fixed. Now, several months past the warranty the vacuum shuts off after 5 minutes no matter what suction setting it is on and then takes 20 minutes to cool down and is operational for the next 5 minutes. No one here in Florida repairs these so I'll do the customer care call center HELL on Monday and see where we go from there. Vacuuming for 5 minutes, resting for 20 minutes, etc is going to get old in a hurry

Title: Save yourself the PAIN--Pay more and get  a dyson or something better
Content:
This little canister looked cute and had lots of good reviews, so I got one. Unfortunately, I'm not going to give it a good review. At first, I was amazed by its strong suction, but the tiny dust container fills up so quickly! When it does, the vacuum automatically shuts off and you have to empty it--very often. If that were my only complaint, it would be a pain, but wouldn't be so so bad. My problem is that after emptying the dust bin, most of the time now, it won't power up again. What seemed to be the problem is, the air filter inside the dust bin gets clogged very quickly. Simply dusting off the dirt doesn't always get the vacuum to start again. Most of the time, I need to clean the filter thoroughly under water and let it dry completely before I can use it again! I can't clean the whole house in one blow. I haven't cleaned half the house before it stops completely. It's ridiculous. This is the biggest problem and the source of my pain and frustration. I've passed my one-year warranty and wouldn't you know it, it stops mid-way so much more often now!
Other issues: The main head tilts to an upright position, but it will not lock. You can't carry it up the stairs or even around the house easily because it's so floppy. The mini head is not motorized--airflow turns the brush. All attachables do not fit in the body--only the small attachments do.

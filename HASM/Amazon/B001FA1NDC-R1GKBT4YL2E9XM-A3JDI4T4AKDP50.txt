Title: Does everything it claims.
Content:
I'm not sure how anyone can be dissatisfied with a defice that holds your favorite music, as well as your shameful indulgences, with a delivery system as flawless as what I have experienced. I listen to my iPod for the variety and mobility it offers me. I couldn't ask for much more in a device, after all, it's about the music for me. iTunes' library is full enough for me, although it's true there are certain albums they don't offer, it's easy enough to find another avenue to install the music you want on your iPod. I don't think you can go wrong with this purchase.

Title: 17 inches of fun
Content:
I love how they packaged the macbook pro.
And the macbook pro is just a beauty. 17 inches, with a great os, and great hardware. 
I'm in love with the machine. I've used mac for about 5 years now, and I had the older version that came out like 4 years ago, and getting this one is just a total upgrade. This macbook pro is faster, better, and so much more sexy. 
I admit it does break the bank, but I believe it's worth every penny!
Mac does it right!

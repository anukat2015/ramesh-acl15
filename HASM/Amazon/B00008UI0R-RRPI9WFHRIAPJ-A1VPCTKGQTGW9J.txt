Title: it sucks great,but just too much trouble to dump
Content:
Great suction for a small inexpensive vacuum, but it's such a pain to empty and rinse the container every time after you vacuum. You can imagine all those flying dust and debris around your garbage can. You need to hold your breath when you do this. May be I'm just spoiled since I always had a Sears bagged canister vacuum. Overall it's a good vacuum for the price.

Title: Great Camera
Content:
I had the Canon EOS Rebel XT. When it came to replace the XT I was looking for compatibility of parts and accessories.  I was originally interested in the XSi with the 12.1 megapixle, but it uses different batteries and memory cards.  So I went with the 10.1MP of the XTi.
Use, I have loved the affordability of the EOS Rebel product lines.  The improvement of the DIGIC processor in the XTi is fantastic.  
I have shot photos with this camera through Southern Utah at Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks, Moab, Virgin River Gorge, and the Grand Canyon.  I also use it as my studio camera.  It is a great, flexible camera.

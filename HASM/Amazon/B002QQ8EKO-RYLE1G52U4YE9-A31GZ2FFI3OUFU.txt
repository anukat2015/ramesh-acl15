Title: I love it
Content:
First off this is the first time I've ever owned a mac so I was unsure of what to expect. Friends of mine have stated that their overpriced and gave me the same old arguments that I've heard from PC lovers before. Yet I found my macbook to be able to do a lot more out of the box than my PC which has better specs but with my pc I couldn't even play dvds on it. No I have to buy a dvd decoder or get preferably one for free.
In either case I happen to love this beautiful macbook and wish that the beautiful iMac 27 inch was in my budget but unfortunately it isn't right now. :(

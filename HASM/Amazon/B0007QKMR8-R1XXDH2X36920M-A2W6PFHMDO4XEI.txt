Title: Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP
Content:
My Canon is now 2 years old, and I would now term it, broken in.  I have taken more than 10,000 photos, and each year I notice my pictures get better.  Having begun my road in photography only 3 years ago, I am still vested in my Canon.  I appreciate the ease of use, the quality of 8MP, and the various lense.  Having cut my teeth on this Canon Rebel XT, it will always be my first love.  Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 Lens (Black)

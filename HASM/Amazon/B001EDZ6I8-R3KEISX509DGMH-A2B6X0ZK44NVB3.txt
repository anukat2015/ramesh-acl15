Title: nice idea, badly executed
Content:
Nice design but the plastic housing seemed really cheesy. Entire unit gave off a bad smell. Worse, the fan quit working within 5 minutes of first use. At that point the footrest began getting hotter and hotter until I was afraid it would burst into flames if I left it on any longer. I'd consider this a dangerous product.

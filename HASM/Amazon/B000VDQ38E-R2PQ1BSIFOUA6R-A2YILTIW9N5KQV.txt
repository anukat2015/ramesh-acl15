Title: Good and bad
Content:
We bought this vacuum 6 weeks ago. We are on the second one and it has started smelling just like the first. I just took it apart because now the rotating floor brush wasn't moving and the belt is broken. We had our first one for one week when it began to smell and we saw smoke coming from it. We called customer service and they told us all new vacuums smell. They suggested we take it to the authorized service center. My husband thought he try the store we bought it at, and fortunately they gave us a new vacuum. I have to say it does have good suction, but the hose wand is awkward to use. We have two big dogs and it does pick up their hair great. I also like the Pet Turbo brush for the furniture, but it's hard to even get it off the front of the vacuum. The cord is nice and long but emptying the dirt container always leaves somewhat of a mess. I've always had vacuums with bags until this one and I can't say that I really like emptying the dirt container instead of just throwing a bag away. I've also never had a belt break after such a short time. The vacuum is pretty heavy, so trying to vacuum up 11 steps is difficult, but I bought it for it's reviews and to do a better job of picking up pet hair, which it does (when it runs right).

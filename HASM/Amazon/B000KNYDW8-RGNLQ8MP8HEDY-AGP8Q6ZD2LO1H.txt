Title: BAD BAD BAD - Do not buy
Content:
Do not buy from this maker. They do not work at all and to top it off the unit that was in the box was not what was described on the outside of the box. Based upon the outside of the box, my unit was supposed to have 4 funtions - it came out of the box with only 2. It was supposed to have 3 fan speeds and it came out of the box with only 2. It is a glorified fan - does not cool past 81 degrees. The company does not back their product and told me that they are packed in China and that Haier is not responsible for what happens in China. Go with another maker unless you are just wanting to have a headache.

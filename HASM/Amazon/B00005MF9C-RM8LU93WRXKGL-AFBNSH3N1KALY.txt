Title: It only makes sense! the best single cup coffee maker in the world --
Content:
More than 20 years ago my wife's father gave us a Black and Decker single cup coffee drip coffee maker.  It makes great coffee with a Melita #1 filter and whatever beans you prefer.  The only issue is that it could not accomodate larger (taller) mugs.  This is a great solution.  Just like our old one, it makes great coffee but also accomodates a taller mug (still not big enough for tall travel cups) 
Given that the coffee maker works just like out old one and the only difference is size, I expect it to last a similarly long time.
Yes the Keurig machines and cups make great coffee too. But at what price?  This makes great coffee for pennies.

Title: First Time User
Content:
I had been tempted to purchase the newest ipod Nano ever since it was released.  I hesitated due to my budget as a student.  
I finally gave into my increasing temptation after I researched it online for the past week.  The following is my honest opinion of this device.
The size is great for those who use public transportation.  I live in New York City, where everyone uses buses and subways.  You can slip it into your pocket without bulking it up.
The sound can easily satisfy the average user.  The headphones that come with it are sufficient, but you can always use headphones that are higher quality.  I own Sennheiser HD 202  Headphones and they totally improve the sound.  This only means that the difference is with the headphones, not the iPod.
As a first time user, the experience overall is amazing.  I had always used a portable CD player until now.  The fact that I can load all of my favorite CDs and mp3s onto one small device is wonderful.
Overall, I don't regret my purchase.  I agree with my friends-- I will wonder how I lived without the iPod.

Title: Great Camera
Content:
Have had this camera for nearly a month now, and I have to say it is truly great for the following reasons:
1. Small size. I'm [....] years old and it's still slighty "too" small (although that is not a problem because I still have no problem gripping it). 
2. Great for every situation. In the month I've had it, I've done everything from ISO 1600 to ISO 100, used and not used flash, telephoto lens action shots at the race track, wide angle abstract stills, manual & autofocus and it has still exceeded all my expectations.
*
I'd say I only have 2 very, very minor complaints:
1. Slightly heavy (especially with telephoto lens). Now this may not be a problem for adults, but given this is the "kids" section I will say that it was a little heavy at first, but I got used to it in 2 or 3 days. If you absolutely can't stand slightly heavy cameras then you may want to settle for a point & shoot or a film SLR (my film SLR is slightly larger but definantly a lot more lightweight). Or you could get a tri-pod. Either way. 
2. The settings dial is a little TOO shiny. Yes, that doesn't sound like a problem and I didn't think it was either but a few days after recieving it I was out photographing in the backyard and the dial reflected the sunlight in a sort of intensified beam and shined directly into my eye (very bad eye pain for the next 20 minutes). My advice: Avoid looking at the settings dial directy on a sunny day.
*
Other than that, I would say if you're looking for a camera, I would very, very very higly recommend this one.

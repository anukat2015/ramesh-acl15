Title: Decent
Content:
Pros:
The installation is easy enough. And the player charges really fast even with just the USB (little over an hour from completely dead).
Cons:
The playthrough system will play all the songs from a given artist or album, and then stop. Its annoying if you only have one song from that artist. You'll have to manually queue songs if you want it to change artists or albums.
You can't turn off the screen unless you shut down the entire unit. The best you can do is make it dim in 5 seconds and set the brightness to 10%. I'm sure the battery would last a lot longer if the screen would just blank out after 5 seconds. 
The password system for certain menu options is ridiculous. You set your password (4 digit #) and everytime you access that menu option, you get to reset you password. So if anyone ever gets your password the first time, they can lock you out of some of the options (or you can just leave it 0000 for a 'no password' option).
Its still a decent mp3 player and the battery life isn't completely gone, so 4 stars. The listed cons I don't think are enough to bring it down another star

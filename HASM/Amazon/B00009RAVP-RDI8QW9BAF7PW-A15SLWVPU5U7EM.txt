Title: Almost lasted through the winter
Content:
I bought one at the beginning of November for heating up my office at home.  It does heat up where it's pointed at and delivers instant warmth.  That's the main purpose for this heater -- keep me warm before the central AC warms up the room.  I used it for about half an hour per day.  The oscillation is noisy and un-stable, but that's all right.  However, today (Feb.20) it finally reached its end of life.  Suddenly the low heat option is gone (gives high heat output), and smoke started to come out after 5 minutes.  I am glad I only used it in office instead of bedrooms while sleeping!  Only use oil-filed or ceramic radiators in your bedrooms!!!

Title: Swell machine
Content:
This design is quite interesting. This vacuum is a good example of how to make a simple machine exotic. You can adjust the suction by pressing a switch on the handle. It does a good job cleaning, parts are easily detachable. Solid quality, made to last. Hoover has always made a good vacuum cleaner.

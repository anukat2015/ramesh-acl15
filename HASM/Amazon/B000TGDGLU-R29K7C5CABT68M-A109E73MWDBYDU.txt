Title: DeLonghi EW7707CM oil filled radiator
Content:
Great heater for the price!Just ordered 2 more,one for my parents and another one for ourselves.The first one we bought is being used to supplement our oil heat in the house(1,400 sq.ft.).Even on recent days with temps. in the teens the house stayed at 68 and the furnace only ran once all day.Haven't got our electric bill yet,but i have to beleive we'll be saving money with oil well over $3.00 gal.Second heater will be used in the garage to supplement the oil furnace.So far I'm very impressed with this heater.

Title: does not seem to warm a small room well
Content:
I just got this unit for a small play room in my basement.  The temp in the basement is around 60F in the winter time.  I set the unit for 68F and in over an hour, the room is still around 60F.  You do feel the heat if you are in front of it but it certainly does not heat up a whole room.  On a more positive note, there is no loud beeps when a button is pushed.

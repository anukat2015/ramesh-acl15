Title: Worth every penny! Nice
Content:
Recently moved into a new home..looked around many vacuums before zeroing on this one.
After using it I'm not disappointed!! Really a nice vacuum and worth every penny..
It is not loud, cleans throughly, easy to assemble and store..It pulls dirt at a very effective pace and the only drawback is that you end up emptying the trash can quiet often.I'm satisfied with this one and will recommend it!!

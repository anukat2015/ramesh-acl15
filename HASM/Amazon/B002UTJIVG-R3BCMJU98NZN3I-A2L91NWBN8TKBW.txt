Title: pretty darn sexy
Content:
The asus ux30 is just drop dead gorgeous. I take it to class where it competes with the laptops of 99 other students and boy does it get a lot of compliments. This certainly draws attention wherever you take it. 
Pros
- beautiful design: super thin, brushed aluminum, hidden ports keep it "clean-looking," flush screen gives it elegance
- weight: super light, easy to just carry around in your hand or plop it inside your handbag
- keyboard: chiclet-style is a lot easier to type on, but that's just my personal preference
- windows 7, if you don't already have it, you gotta try it
- webcam: mine came with a 1.3mg webcam even though Amazon's description said .3mg so I don't know what's the deal with that
- 2 year global warranty
Cons
- the touchpad was almost unbearable at first. but after some time I got used to it.
- battery life is not as great as other asus models but mine lasted about 3 hours without any power-saving settings so that's good enough for me.
- processor is alright but don't expect to do much gaming or other demanding stuff.
the bottom line -- If you want a powerful computer that supports extensive gaming and has a super long battery life, this isn't for you. But if you're like me and you're willing to overlook some of the shortcomings (like that awful trackpad) because you want something sleek and sexy that will turn a lot of heads, you can't go wrong with this. I hang around a lot of mac freaks and this laptop puts their macbooks to shame.

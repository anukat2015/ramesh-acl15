Title: Slick
Content:
Slick is the word I think of whenever I use my new Macbook Pro.  I have wanted a MBP since 2007.  I bought one from Amazon and had to return it for a defective Display.  Amazon sent me another one and it too had the same problem so I sent it back and ended up getting an IBM ThinkPad T60p.  Even thought my T60p is OK, I never got over wanting a Mac.  So when the new Unibody MBP's came out and the price of these went way down, I thought I would try again.  Well, I am so glad I did.  The display is so much better now and it is so fast.  I love the new multi touch trackpad. I also like my MBP because it is just so gorgeous.  That is not enough of a reason to get one however, but it sure doesn't hurt.

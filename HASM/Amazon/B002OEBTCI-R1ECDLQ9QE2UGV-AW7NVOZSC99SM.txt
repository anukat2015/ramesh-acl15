Title: Love my Pentax!
Content:
For all of you trying to decide on which DSLR to buy, get the Pentax K-X. I researched all the DSLR's for about a year, and this camera is by far the best bang for the buck.I have friends that own the other brands(and they are all great camera's)and my K-X will do anything thers's will do for a lot less money.So quit pulling your hair out reading all these reviews and trying to decide which camera to buy.This camera is very easy to use and a great bargin.

Title: Nice... Once It's Installed Correctly
Content:
This is a nice thermostat.  It does have a few issues I discovered now that it has been in use about a week.
1) The wiring instructions are not correct, at least not for my AC unit.  I wound up calling an AC company who was nice enough to walk me through the wiring over the phone for free (there are a few good people left out there).  Only two of the five wires actually went to where the instructions said they should.
2) The backlighting only stays on for about five seconds, its kind of a let down considering I paid $25 more for the version that is backlit over the same one without the backlighting option.
Now that it is installed, it is easy to program and works fine.  
I gave this item two stars due to the 40% extra I paid for a disapointing backlighting feature and the incorrect instalation instructions.  I almost had to pay a $100 service call to have someone install a $60 thermostat!
One piece of advice, make sure its not hot out when you do the instalation.  I live in Arizona, it was 113 degrees outside and 78 inside when I started this, thinking it would only take a minute.  When I was done two hours later, after the phone call with the AC guy, it was 98 degrees inside my house.

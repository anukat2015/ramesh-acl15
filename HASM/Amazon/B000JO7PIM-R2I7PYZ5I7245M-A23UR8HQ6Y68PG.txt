Title: IPod
Content:
The product itself works well - no complaints.  It is not obvious from the instructions how to set it up.  I think it stinks that it does not come with a case.  I paid $119 for the IPod and then I had to buy a case for another $35.  This is stupid and cheap on the company's part. Who uses this thing without a protective case?  I use this while I am running and at the gym.

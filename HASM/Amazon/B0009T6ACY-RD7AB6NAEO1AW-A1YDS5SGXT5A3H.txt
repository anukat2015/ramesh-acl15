Title: Does the job well for me!
Content:
We purchased this unit after reading reviews and recommendations for just about every Portable A/C available at the time. Now I am back to Amazon to purchase a second unit for our bedroom.
First of all, you need to understand portable a/c units are NOT very efficient compared to window units. And if you are comparing them to central units... forget it. 
But if you have a small area like us that you just want to be a little more livable and the area you live does not allow window units this product does a nice job. It does not lower the temperature of our living room much if we turn it on when it is already hot, but it does reduce the humidity quite a bit. If we start it early in the afternoon before it gets really hot inside it can keep the room at an even more comfortable temperature.
For the best results when you set it up make sure the vent is not blocked AT ALL. If the hot air can blow out and away from your home you will get much better results. When we had it slightly blocked by plants outside the window, we could feel the heat building up and coming back in through the closed window.

Title: We Love It
Content:
This has been a good coffeemaker.  It took us several uses to understand how much coffee to use.  This device requires more coffee than our older, cheaper coffeemaker.  However, once we fed it what it wanted, it rewarded us with a very good cup of coffee.  The timer works well.  The user interface is straight-forward.  The coffee is good and hot right after it finishes and does a good job of keeping the coffee fresh tasting.  The beep that informs you that it is completed is handy, as is the auto-shutoff.  I'm not in love with where the water needs to be poured.  It is adjacent to the coffee.  But that is my only complaint.

Title: Totally worth the money
Content:
I read the negative reviews and was a little leery on purchasing this product. I decided that since it's under 20 dollars, what did I have to lose? Let me just say, it has been a lifesaver! The office I work at is set to a low temperature, and I always froze. This heater runs all morning every day and I have yet to have a problem. It heats up my cube fast, and doesn't smell like burning. It's also very quiet so it doesn't disturb the people around me. My coworkers are constantly asking to borrow it. I definately recommend it!

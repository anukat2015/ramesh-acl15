Title: This coffeemaker could cause a divorce!
Content:
We have had this coffee maker for approx. 1 month. The first time the coffee maker "dumped" on the counter I had screwed the lid on crooked. The second time my husband was sure it was my fault and gave me lessons on screwing the lid on and placing the carafe correctly. The next dump was when he made coffee. Now we stand there and watch as the coffee is brewed to make sure it is going in the pot. This morning I watched until the pot was half full and then (thinking everything was OK) went to take my shower. I came back to the "dumped" coffee - all over the counter and the floor. I HATE THIS COFFEE MAKER. The only good thing - when the _ _ _ _ thing works correctly - the coffee does stay hot. I will now buy any other brand of coffee maker. This one sucks! There may have been problems with an earlier designed coffee maker BUT they have not been fixed

Title: Good MP3 Player
Content:
This MP3 player have been great! Although I haven't been able to play video on it. Does anyone know how to do that? THe sound quality if okay,it doesn't let you get the exact volume you want. The screen is a little sticky, but after a while you get used to it. It is extreamly light weight. I wish there was case or something you could buy to protect it, but Archos doesn't offer it.
Overall, it is a below acceptable music player for the price.
after having it for 3 months, it has already started to wear out, the sound quality is horrible and it stops and starts randomly. the warranty does not work and the video does not work. I am not pleased with it.

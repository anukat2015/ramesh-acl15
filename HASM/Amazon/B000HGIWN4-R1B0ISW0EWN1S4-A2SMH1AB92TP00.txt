Title: Nikon does it again, Great Camera
Content:
- Battery life is excellent - I hav used camera for two weeks with flash photos and battery is only at 1/2.
- Flash photos are very good color and image.
- Flash adjusts very well to almost all photo situations. 
- Zoom is very powerful. I am able to get close-up shots from far away.
- The wide angle is wide enough for almost every wide shot needed.
- I have the camera set to 10.2 m and fine. I can still take over 500 photos with 4GB HCSD memory.
- The color seems to always be true.
- Flash recovery is fast.
-Automatic flash pop up when needed.
- The camera set-up on most defaults make taking photos easy and very sharp. 
I recommend this to everyone.

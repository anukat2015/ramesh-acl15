Title: Looks great. Finicky and broke after 1.5 years
Content:
Nice looking machine. I can't complain about the coffee it makes.
Many of the reviewer note that everything has to be lined up just so in order to make it work, prevent spills, etc. It's true. But, that isn't enoguh to kill this. You learn to adapt. (Not a good machine though if there are lots of causal users like in a workplace).
A few also note that the timer controls are archaic and confusing. It's true. We used the timer for a while, but then the power went out at our house and we had to reset it. It took 15 minutes to find the manual, etc. Painful, non intuitive controls.
One of the features of the machine is that it has a place to tuck the cord, but if you unplug it then you have to figure out how to reset the clock and timers, etc.
The handle on the gold basket broke after about 3 months and I didn't bother to get it replaced. Now, about 1.5 years after receiving this as a gift it is dead. Totally. No lights, no life, nothing.
For $129 you should get much more than this machine delivers. A better warranty beyond the 1 year would help too. I give this a pass. If it hadn't broken down I would have given it two stars. As it is, 1.

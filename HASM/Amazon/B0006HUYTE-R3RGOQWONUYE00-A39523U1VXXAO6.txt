Content:
Who would believe a housework shirker could now think of vacuuming as FUN! "Mom, I'm using it every chance I get....all the attachments, too."  These words from the daughter whose homemaking skills are in the zilch area.  I sent her this vacuum to replace the one my Grandmother gave me as a wedding gift over 40 yrs ago. Heavy, awkward and ugly has turned to cute, light and sexy. Only drawback:  no auto cord rewind.   Need I add "highly recommend"?

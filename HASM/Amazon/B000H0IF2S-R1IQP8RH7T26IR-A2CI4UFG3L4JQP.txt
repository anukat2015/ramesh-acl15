Title: Saved me on 2 flights.
Content:
After 2 very long and delayed flights my ipod saved me from screaming and crying children and others. Several people could not believe how small it was.  The sound was great and the battery lasted a long time. It was easy to dowload my CD's and simple to use. I can clip it on and take it everywhere.I love it.

Title: Works Great
Content:
The hose with regulator works great for my Big Buddy Heater.  I used it to heat my garage when I was working on my car. I ran it on high with a full 20 lb propane tank for several hours and did not run out of propane.  The quick connect is a nice feature also, it makes it easy to disconnect the hose from the heater to move it around.

Title: Splendid Design, Marvelous Coffee
Content:
I'm so glad that I let my experience of the previous incarnation of Cuisinart's &quot;Grind and Brew&quot; guide me rather than heeding the negative customer reviews on this page. The design is a joy--amazingly simply and intuitive, and it looks great, too.  All the parts are easy to clean, and the coffee (and I love mine strong and dark) is perfect every time. The addition of the charcoal filter for the water is a welcome change. I loved it so much I bought one for a friend who is a busy physician, constantly on the run. He loves his, too.

Title: i have NOT received my $50 rebate  from amazon
Content:
i ordered this item december 23, 2008, 
received the item the next day, 
completed the rebate process online, 
got a reference number for the completion, 
got an email in a month or so from amazon that the rebate was "approved of", 
called amazon more than five times as i haven't seen the rebate, 
only to be told 
1) i didn't complete the process,  
2) the rebate was on the way, 
3) i would have to call the "rebate center" (that is NOT part of amazon) where i got irrelevant recorded messages and no real person to talk to, 
4) i would receive it in a week or two since i indeed completed the required process, 
5) i would get an email from amazon with "complete information" about the rebate.
i went to the order information page in my amazon account and there is NO way to contact amazon with this issue but to call.
so here it is.
amazon will probably block this review, as well.
but i will NOT go away, Amazon, until i get my rebate and your reasonable explanation for this otherwise shameful practice of yours.
stay tuned.

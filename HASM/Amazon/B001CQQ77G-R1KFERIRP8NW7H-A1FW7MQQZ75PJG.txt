Title: GREAT ELECTRIC HEATER- BAD AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE
Content:
I LOVE THIS HEATER-- but first, my gripe about Amazon. I've been a customer for years because Amazon gave the best customer service, including their price policy. Previously, if Amazon lowered
the price of an item within a short period of time of when you purchased it, they refunded you the
difference between the higher price you paid. NO LONGER SO ! Within less than 2 weeks of the
day I purchased this heater--even before it was delivered--Amazon lowered the price about $17.
They would NOT credit my account the difference--saying they changed this policy.I spoke with 2 supervisors to no avail. This heater was expensive even at the first sale I purchased it at-$185.
Then, they lowered it to a new sale price of about $168. As a buyer, it makes me feel like a fool for buying it immediately...it's a NEWLY ISSUED heater by DeLonghi. I tried
unsuccessfuly to tell Amazon that in a very bad economic climate this is sheer stupidity on
Amazon's part to not honor a buyer who buys an item immediately.Now--to the heater. I purchased
it because of the claim that it HEATS UP IMMEDIATELY-- and ,NOT because of the stove affect
or faux burning coals. I live in a rented, very poorly insulated 2 bedroom cottage in Connecticut with old, ineffective electric baseboard heat. Connecticut has one of the 3 highest electric rates in the country--over $300 a month to heat this cottage at only 58 degrees! Last year, I purchased
DeLonghi radiator type heater -- it was great and warmed a good part of this cottage--but takes
almost 2 hours to reach warmth. Since I am NOT using ANY baseboard heat and ONLY the DELONGHI,
I hoped this new DeLonghi stove heater WITH BLOWER REALLY WOULD be INSTANT. Happily, it DOES
HEAT UP IMMEDIATELY. The blower causes the heat to rise and spread out.I am even warmer with just
this one heater with blower than I was last year with the DeLonghi radiator heater without blower. As to cost, it's very economical even with Connecticut's staggering rates. I estimated it would
cost about $100 a month to use this heater 12 hours a day-- every day...and the first month's bill
was that.I'm saving over $200 a month by using only this and NOT the electric baseboard heat.MOST PEOPLE would find it costs MUCH LESS A MONTH because of LOWER ELECTRIC RATES.This use is for the living and kitchen area. This one heater doesn't completely reach the bedrooms
with the same comfort warmth, but I wasn't concerned about that as I use warm comforters for sleep.Most people would use this heater in addition to heat and would find the warmth even better than my own experience.I AM VERY PLEASED with the HEAT OUTPUT and am DELIGHTED I PURCHASED IT. While I didn't buy it for the stove affect, I like it very much.

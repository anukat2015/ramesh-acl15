Title: Cute, no circulation
Content:
I agree with all on the look of heater.  It's cute and welcoming.  The heater just doesn't have any kind of circulation for the heat, so it doesn't seem very effective to me.  I use it in combination with another heater, and they seem to get the job done.  My room is larger than they recommend for this size heater.   I use an air filter in front of it that blows the air, it works much better this way, though not as attractive.
If left on all day, it definitely will keep the chill away.  I'm in Southern California, so the cold isn't quite freezing, and generally, days are warmer.

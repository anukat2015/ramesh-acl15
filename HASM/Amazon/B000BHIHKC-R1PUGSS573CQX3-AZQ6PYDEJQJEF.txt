Title: Pretty good, and pretty annoying at the same time
Content:
First the good: 
- It produces a good tasting cup of coffee; it's not too weak like some coffee makers tend to be. 
- It's always hot. 
- The machine is pretty simple to use; all you have to do is press a button for how many ounces you want to fill your cup.
- All you have to do is rinse out the little holder that holds the coffee pod every once in a while. There's no huge craft or glass pot to clean every time you use it like a regular coffee maker.
Now for the bad: 
- There is an option to fill your cup with 7 oz, 9 oz, or 14 oz. I usually select 9 oz to full my cup and some times it will do it, and some times it falls way short and I have to select 7 oz to fill it the rest of the way. It greatly varies in accuracy in how much it fills your cup. 
- I can buy a big tub of coffee that will last me forever for a regular coffee maker for the same price of those dinky packages with pods in them and the pods will only last me a couple of weeks. 
Overall it is a pretty decent coffee maker, but it does have its flaws too.

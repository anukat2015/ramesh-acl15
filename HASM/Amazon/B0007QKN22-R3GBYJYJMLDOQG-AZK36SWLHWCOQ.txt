Title: Great, Flexible Camera
Content:
I selected this Canon d-SLR camera because of the DigicII processor capturing images at 8 megapixels. So far I have been shooting in only two formats-RAW and high-res JPG. After two weeks of shooting, I'm starting to get used to the different options. I like shooting in black and white in RAW format, but it is nice to also be able to reprocess these images back into full color with the software that comes packaged with the camera. The camera is so good that it is forcing me to buy a new photo printer to do it justice. I bought the standard "kit" lens with the 18-55mm zoom. It is a good lens for the price. I just wish it were just a little faster than f3.5-5.6. I do, have the option,however, of buying about four more Canon EF-S lenses (offered as of 9/2005) that are made especially for the camera's sensor dimensions as well as many EF lenses. Flexibility, ease of use, small learning curve, great photos, and a concise but well organized owner's manual all make the Canon Rebel XT (350D) a great digital camera to own.

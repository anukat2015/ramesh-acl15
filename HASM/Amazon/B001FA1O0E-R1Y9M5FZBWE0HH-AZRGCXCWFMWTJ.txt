Title: Love this thing!
Content:
I love my ipod. This thing is awesome. I have NO problems with it whatsoever. Advice, get a silicon case and a screen protector and you are all set. Every now and then I hit the wrong letter but for the most part no issue. You get used to it. I bought the 8gig only because I don't need any more than that. It's insane to get more than that for anyone who repeatedly plays the same songs and less of others. If you aren't using wifi just turn it off and the battery lasts much longer. I tend to charge this every day or every other day, sometimes 3 or more days after. The battery charging isn't an issue for me regardless. It's a small electronic device, what do you expect? The external volume control is okay. Not loud by any means but I suppose that is the point of getting the whole sound system for it. But the head phone volume is awesome, even too loud. And the earbuds are to big I think, that it hurts after a little while of wearing. Oh and when I first got it before uploading/downloading anything, at setup my computer told me it had only 7. Something of space, not 8gigs. minor detail but still misleading info of product. There are a decent amount of free apps to put on here. With all this said, I think anyone and everyone should have one. It's worth it.

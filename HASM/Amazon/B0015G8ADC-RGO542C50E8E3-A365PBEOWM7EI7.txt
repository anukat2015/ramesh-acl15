Title: good value
Content:
I am not furnace mechanic.  I am diy-er whose furnace quit one day.  I was able to follow the diagnostics listed in the manual and deduce that this switch may be the problem.
For those in the same shoes and looking at this, disconnect the rubber hose and blow into it.  If you have a separate switch, slip thin screw driver and try pushing on the switch.  It's either stuck switch or stuck diaphram (I know this is wrong spelling).
The replacement does not come with exterior mounted switch.  The replacement, apparently, has a switch built into the round body.  
I called the supplier to ask if this was indeed the right replacement.  It is listed as replacement for the model number I have.  But the store operator/owner asked for the pressure rating of the original switch, which I did not have, especially being a novice diy.  I kind of felt sorry for this guy, getting calls from house owners who bought from Amazon.  Plumbing suppliers usually talks to professionals only, you see.  But the guy was willing to look it up,if I can get my numbers.  I decided to install it and see if it works.  I would buy from this place again.

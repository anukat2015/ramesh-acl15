Title: not shipped well and will not know result until Yule Day
Content:
Normally things I have purchased from Amazon are nicely packed so they do not move around in the box during shipment.  However, this 32GB Ipod Touch I have bought my husband  for Yule arrived in a box twice the size of the Ipod touch with no packing material whatsoever. I do not doubt it banged from side to side and up and down during the entirety of its USPS shipment.  I sincerely hope when my husband opens this gift and begins to use it, it is in fine working condition.  I will be sorely upset if it is not. I normally do not spend this much money on one gift.  I thought I would not be in the wrong purchasing from Amazon considering the flat screen television he bought from Amazon two months ago had arrived in a cautious and careful manner.

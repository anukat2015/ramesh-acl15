Title: Nice Little Heater
Content:
A well-designed, sturdy, easy-to-use heater, very reliable. It quickly heats a small room, without having to be set at the highest settings. It has four basic fan settings -- off, fan-only, low, and high. The other dial is the thermostat/temperature dial that can be set to a wide range (11 points) of temperature settings. After you reach your desired room temperature you can easily calibrate the thermostat to go on and off automatically to maintain it. It is small, reasonably quiet, and attractive and seems solidly built when picked up. I bought this at the end of the season last year and don't remember what I paid for it, but I believe it was under $20 -- a very good bargain. To sum up -- easy to use, reliable, inexpensive.

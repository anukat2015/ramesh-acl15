Title: Solid DSLR solution
Content:
Its great, but IMO a APS-C sensor is too small for 10MP, it reveals the imperfections of the lens and is half as sensitive as the 6mp versions. If i was buying again i would a get a d40 since it has most of the features  like the big screen. If you use DX glass its the perfect body and leaves money for accessories like sb-800.

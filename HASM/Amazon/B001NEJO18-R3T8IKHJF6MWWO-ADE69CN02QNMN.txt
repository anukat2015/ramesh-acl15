Title: Words cannot express....
Content:
Words cannot express the love I have for my new laptop.  I finally got rid of my old cluncky desktop and this 17 inch laptop is the perfect substitute.  Love the numbers keyboard to the right (great for working in spreadsheets).  Windows Vista allows for multiple users so all my settings and preferences remain, even after others have used the laptop.  I have an account for a guest and for my husband.  There are not enough good things I can say.  The screen size is great and it's surprisingly light weight.  It's extremely fast very quite.  I highly recommend it to anyone!  Vista is very different, but I'm smart and after a few hours, I got the hang of it.  You will too.

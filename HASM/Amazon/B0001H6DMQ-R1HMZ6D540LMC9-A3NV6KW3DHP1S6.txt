Title: This Vacuume Sucks!
Content:
Bought this based on other reviews. I was still impressed when we got it. 
It's well made and seems real sturdy. Very powerful suction.
Bought it for our travel trailer as my wife has been through 3 in one year just for the trailer. 
We have a built in at home and I still caught my wife using the Hoover :)

Title: Great 16 gig mp3 player for under $200
Content:
Having owned every generation of nano, this is the best, beating the 3rd generation only slightly. The accelerometer works good and there is an included game that uses it. The Genius feature is great and seems more useful than I would have thought. A new spoken menu system works well. Similar to car GPS, its text to speech. The visually impaired will love this ipod. 
However, using the click wheel isn't as easy as the 3rd generation however. The third was easier to hold and use than this one. Battery life has dropped from 5 to 4 hours with this one. There still isn't a built in FM radio like so many other Mp3 players such as sansa and zune. But for $149 for an 8gig and $199 for the 16gig, this is a great music player. Built very solid. The first generation nanos had such a soft plastic casing that even cotton jeans would scratch it. Just about everyone was upset about that. So while we didn't get some key features, for the price the player is quite a bargin.

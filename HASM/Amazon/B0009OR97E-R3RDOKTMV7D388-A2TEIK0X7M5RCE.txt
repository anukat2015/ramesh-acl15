Title: Metropolitan AMD-4PNHSF w/ power nozzle
Content:
We just opened the box. It took all of 5 minutes to put it together. First thing I checked was the suction. It was great. Two negatives, no auto cord recoil and the exhaust is loud. It is well built, glides nicely along the floor, comes with all the accessories, including two extra chrome metal wands, has a powerful rug beater and the bare floor nozzle has great bristles. It is light weight so it is easy to carry up the stairs and makes it OK to clean the stairs, although I wish the hose was longer. We have had all types of vacuums, Oreck upright, sharp canister, Hoover canister, shop vacs, etc. After all is said and done, when you get right down to it, you have to use a canister vac if you want to really clean. It allows you to get the dirt and dust in those hard to reach places and an upright is simply not going to cut it. We looked at all the vacs, Electrolux, Dyson, Eureka, Kenmore, Bla, Bla, Bla, Ba Bla. Based on price, performance, ease of use, durability and good old SUCTION!, this Metro is the sucker of all house vacs, bar none. It has a toggle switch for low and high suction and the power head is well made. My wife just made a comment that it is LOUD, but man it really feels like the house is clean!! Go for it!!!

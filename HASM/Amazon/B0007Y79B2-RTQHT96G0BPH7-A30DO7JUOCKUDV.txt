Title: Two cents look large beside this thing
Content:
I thought I should add my comments to the other 6 billion just to cover it all.  I have owned my Black Nano for a few weeks now and its my first. I have owned a few other playes in the past (mostly from Creative) but have not really liked them usually due to the capacity of them.  I got my Nano and removed the packing like I was doing open heart surgery.  My first impression was "Damn this thing is small".  I connected it to my PC (sorry not a Mac convert yet, baby steps) and itstall itunes and almost returned the thing.  I hate itunes the interface sucks, I had trouble getting music on the ipod and it made the whole process of getting such a great item stink. I guess one of the reasons is that I have a laptop and no mouse so I use the trackball function and it is difficult to drag stuff so I typically use shortcuts on the keyboard.  Yes I know since I am a itunes nube I am missing something but hey Apple is suppose to be easy and it wasnt. Since this is a review on the iPod and not the software I will say something about it.
It scratches easily!! (you don't have to know who Steve Jobs is to know this thing is delicate) Do yourself a favor and buy a case for it the same time you buy the player.  The player does come with a small sleeve but it is dumb and you would do better off with something else. The interface is fairly easy to use but a little touchy.  I have not found it yet but the light it bright on it so bright if you are listening to music in bed your best to not look at it when you change songs. There you go you might as well buy it weather you need it or not its history and it looks good.

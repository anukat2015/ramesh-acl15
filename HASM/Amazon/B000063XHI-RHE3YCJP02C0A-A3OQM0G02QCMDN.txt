Title: Capresson MT-500
Content:
I've been reading how wonderful this machine is, and after a month of 2-pot/day use, I generally agree with the high praise. I do have 3 comments:
-- It is irritating to only have the water level indicator on the right side of the tank. Since my coffee maker is to the right of the sink, and I fill water with the faucet extension, I had to put a piece of white tape inside the tank with a homemade fill line. Why couldn't they put the indicator on both sides?
-- I had read about this, but the carafe really-&-truly pours slowly. Especially towards the end of the pot of coffee. It really is irritating, and this happens with every pour. It's not in the category of "just plain wrong" but it is consistently irritating.
-- This was my first experience with a water filter, which removes chlorine and such. Well, the first couple of brews tasted weak. I was very puzzled that I needed an additional scoop-plus of coffee per pot. Turns out that I >like&lt; the taste of unfiltered water. Alas.

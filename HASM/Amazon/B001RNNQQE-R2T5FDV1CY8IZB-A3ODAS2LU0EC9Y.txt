Title: Too Kool Koffee
Content:
We had to have a small base coffee pot to fit our space.  That's the good.  It is aggravating that it does not have a burner to keep the coffee warm.  A caraffe alone does not do the job, so you better be ready to drink it as soon as it stops making or you will have lukewarm coffee.

Title: Kinda necessary for the rugs
Content:
While the Bosch vacuum comes with a standard floor/carpet attachment, it's just kinda basic. This thing has a brush and therefore does a much nicer job on rugs. I once had an issue where the brush got kinda jammed and wasn't rolling, but I easily unjammed it (I think it was just full of hair), and it's been fine ever since.

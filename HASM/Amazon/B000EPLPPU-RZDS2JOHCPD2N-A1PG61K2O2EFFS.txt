Title: GREAT FOR THE GYM OR WORKOUTS!!
Content:
THIS IPOD IS GREAT FOR WORKING OUT AT THE GYM OR ANYWHERE REALLY---YOU DON'T NEED AN ARM BAND TO ATTACH IT TO & IT IS SO SMALL AND STILL HOLDS OVER 200 SONGS!!  YOU CAN CLIP IT RIGHT TO YOUR SPORTS BRA OR SHIRT AND IT'S SO LIGHT YOU DON'T KNOW IT IS THERE---I LOVE THIS!  I AM BUYING A SECOND ONE FOR MY HUSBAND TODAY!
THIS PRODUCT IS PERFECT FOR THE PERSON WHO DOESN'T NEED OR WANT ANY OF THE EXTRA STUFF LIKE VIDEOS, MUSIC VIDEOS, BIG DISPLAY SCREENS, ETC.(WHICH RACKS UP THE PRICE ON SOME OF THOSE OTHER IPODS)---I JUST WANTED SOMETHING SMALL AND SIMPLE TO LISTEN TO TUNES AT THE GYM WITH & THIS IS THE PERFECT ITEM FOR THAT!

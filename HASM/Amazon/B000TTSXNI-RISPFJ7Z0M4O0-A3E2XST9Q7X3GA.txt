Title: Love it!
Content:
I bought two of these one for myself and one as a gift. I've had mine for about 3 months now
and it works like a dream. I haven't had any problems with the cord getting too hot or the
unit and I sometimes leave it on all day. Even after having it on all day I can just turn it off
and move it to another room without having to let it cool down, because the top and back 
handle are cool to the touch. 
This unit heats large and small rooms well. A large room will take a bit longer to heat, but
in about 20 or 30 minutes you will notice that it's warmer, faster if you happen to be
near the heater =) The oscillating feature is wonderful, because if you are near the heater
you won't get too hot like you would with other heaters.

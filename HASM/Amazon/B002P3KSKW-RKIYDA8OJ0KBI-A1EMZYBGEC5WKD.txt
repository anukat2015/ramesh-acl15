Title: Why get a netbook when you can have it ALL?!
Content:
I've had this baby over a month now. And I am impressed!
The dual-core ultra-low voltage processor in this machine is powerful, yet it sips juice like it was liqueur!
I've been able to watch videos with no jitter or lag, do spreadsheet work, just about everything my gigantic desktop machine will do, all UNPLUGGED!
The only cons I've found are minor:
     1. The wireless internet adapter built into the machine was very difficult to network into my home network. It took about 45 minutes of help from a computer genius that I know, to find some obscure Tech Support bulletin and go into the registry and change a "0" to a "1". (Yes, that's all it took, but finding the RIGHT zero was the trick...)
     2. As you've heard from others, the simple lack of a CAPS LOCK light is very frustrating. Can't believe that Acer left that out! Hopefully, I'll find some utility online that at least makes a flag on the SCREEN when CAPS LOCK is on.
The light weight, relatively big screen, full-sized chicklet-style keyboard, fast boot time, fast processing and DVD-ROM do it for me. Along with, of course, pretty amazing battery life (I'm getting about 6 hours actual USAGE - not idle time - but I'm not doing any real careful energy-management either).

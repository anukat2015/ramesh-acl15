Title: Stylish and functional
Content:
I love making cocoa so when I came across this I had to have it. I have a modern kitchen and this fits in perfectly.
The cord wraps around the bottom of the machine which is a terrific touch. It simply works as decribed. The stainless steel carafe keeps it hot enough for me.
The only little issue I have is that there is always liquid that is heated to the bottom. No big deal, it washes off with soap and water. 
I'd recommend this product.

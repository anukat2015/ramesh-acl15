Title: still working after 6 years
Content:
Have had this heater for 6 years now and have used it a lot.  Much of that time it has been working every winter evening on a small landing where the heat it produces on the high setting boosts the temperature of adjacent rooms, allowing me to keep the gas furnace thermostat set significantly lower.
Prior to locating it there, I kept it at the foot of my bed to turn on via the remote before I got up on cold mornings.  It was like a hot comforting little sun -- very pleasant.
My cat adores roasting for hours in front of it every evening.  On especially cold days, I leave it on for her for an hour or two in the low setting.  She enjoys it more than her heated cat bed.
The tip-over shut-off does work (suggest avoiding heaters that don't have this critical safety feature).
The timer is also a very good feature -- very easily set for up to several hours at time in 15 minute increments.

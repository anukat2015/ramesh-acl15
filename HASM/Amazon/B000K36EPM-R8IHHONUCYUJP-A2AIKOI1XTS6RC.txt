Title: No replacement part available
Content:
I love this coffee maker, however the little "awning" that sits above the carafe when it is in place, is not stainless steel, it is peeling!! The machine still works so I contacted Mr. Coffee customer service to get a replacement, I was told it was not available. Too bad that the machine works fine but I have little specks of silver paint on my counter all the time!!

Title: There is only one thing wrong here...
Content:
This thing is fabulous. In every way. Quiet. Powerful enough. Light. It's like a little "being" that follows you around and cleans your house. It's completely sealed off so dust and crud that is swirling around inside the machine does not get out. The only thing wrong? Not built here. Memo to American manufacturers, auto and otherwise: Really good stuff gets people all excited, so excited, that the excitement induces other people to buy the same stuff. And the damndest thing is that the really good stuff gets people excited because really good stuff STANDS OUT from the dreck.

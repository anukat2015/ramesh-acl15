Title: very good for beginners and nice for travel
Content:
the battery was really long-last. A full charged battery can take about 1500 pics. That was very nice for people in travelling. The only weakness is the lense in the kit can not focus very well under dark enviorment or short distance. But it is still a good dslr though.

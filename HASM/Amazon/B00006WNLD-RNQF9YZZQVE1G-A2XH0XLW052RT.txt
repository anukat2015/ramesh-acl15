Title: A Great and Convenient Coffee Maker
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for about two weeks now and both my husband and myself are very happy with the purchase. It is very convenient and works very well, brewing a cup of coffee in about 3 minutes. The only improvements I'd like to see to this product would be to make it just a little taller. While some of my 12 oz coffee cups do fit, I have others that do not. Also, you have to poor the water in from the left side wich makes it a little less convenient for the right handed.

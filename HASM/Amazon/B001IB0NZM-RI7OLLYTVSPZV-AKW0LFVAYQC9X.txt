Title: It's really great!
Content:
I love this vacuum cleaner, it's compact, strong, very good suction, comes with both diposable bags and a fabric bag. it's really awsome and easy to use! It's lightweight, comes with an additional part that vacuums hair from fabrics, sofas etc. Just buy it! Definitely worth the money! You can use it on floors and carpets.
I know that my review sounds like a commercial add, but believe me it's a really good vacuum cleaner!

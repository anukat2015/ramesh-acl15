Title: Love this vacuum!
Content:
I have owned this vacuum for about two years and its wonderful.  When I first took it out of the box, I thought for 99.99 it was going to be chintzy, and I'd be kicking myself for wasting that money.  I find it has excellent power, easy for me to get around the house with.  I read other reviews recently about the cord  not retracting.  The cord has to be free to rewind.  I liked it so much, I suggested my mom who is 76 get one as the heavier hoovers are too much for her to lug around.  She loves it too! I don't know how to buy a new filter tho....I keep cleaning the one I have and it's fine so far, would like a new one tho.

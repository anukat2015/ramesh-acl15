Title: iPOD Nano 4th Generation
Content:
The 4th Generation Nano met all my expectations, but I am now disappointed that I didn't wait for the 5th Generation Nano. After upgrading iTunes to 9.x I discovered a feature called Genius Mix. But guess what.  It's not compatible with the 4th Gen iPOD. So here I have my new iPOD, not even a month old, and already it's outdated for complete iTunes compatibility.  That's my only grip.

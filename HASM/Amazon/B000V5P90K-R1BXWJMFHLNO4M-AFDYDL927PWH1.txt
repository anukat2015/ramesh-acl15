Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)
I also included the 18-55mm zoom lens.
I own a 30+year old Canon AE-1 which I've loved but we have entered the digital age so I finally purchased the EOS before my trip to Europe last fall.  I am still learning all that it is capable of doing but so far I am really enjoying it.  Takes terrific pictures. Easy to upload to the computer.  I take the chip to the camera shop to make prints - also easy.
I may buy additional lenses as my abilities improve.

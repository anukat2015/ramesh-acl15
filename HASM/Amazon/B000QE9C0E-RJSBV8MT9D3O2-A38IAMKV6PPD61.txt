Title: Lost suction after one month
Content:
I have a friend who has had a great expeerience with this vacuum so I purchased one. Great price. But the honeymoon is over. And I did not save my receipt unfortunately. I feel the marketplace is out of control when, assuming I had my receipt, I cannot go to the "person" (Target) I bought it from and have them handle repairs. Even if I had my receipt, I am not sure I would devote a precious weekend hour to sending it to the manufacturer. Meanwhile, I borrow my friend's.Sad, but true.

Title: First DSLR
Content:
I decided to upgrade from a point and shoot camera to a digital SLR camera 2 weeks ago. I had done hours upon hours of research of what dSLR to get. Some suggested the Nikon route, but I opted for Canon.
The XSi was everything I could have asked for. As a beginner, I feel like I can grow with this camera. The only con I have is not waiting 2 weeks for the price to go down to what it is now! Haha
If you are thinking about getting this, definitely check it out in a store first so you can actually hold it in your hands. Some say it's too small for their hands. I have small hands, so it fits perfectly. But if it's too small, I've heard that some people just add the grip and it works for them (plus the extra stability for heavier lens and the extra battery life).
Overall, I would recommend this for anyone looking to buy their first DSLR camera.

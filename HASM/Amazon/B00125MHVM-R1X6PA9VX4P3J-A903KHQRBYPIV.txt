Title: Viewfinder Problems
Content:
I bought this camera in March of 2008, before it was in stores. I have loved this camera. But as I've started to become a better photographer, I am not so fond of this camera afterall.  
The problem I am having is this: what I see in the viewfinder is NOT what I get! I wonder if anyone else is having this problem?  Mine is shooting high. 
I have used friend's cameras and theirs do not have this problem. I bought Sony to be different, to not have the same kind of camera as everyone else. It is looking like I should have gone with the norm.

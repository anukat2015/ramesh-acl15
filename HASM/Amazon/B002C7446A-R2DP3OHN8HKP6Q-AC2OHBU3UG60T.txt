Title: Go Mac You Won't Go Back
Content:
I don't want to reiterate what everybody else has already said. But for the most part it is true. Yes the first day or so I had some choice words for my new MBP. But now, everyday I am more amazed what this thing can do. A lot of thought went into the design of this computer. The speed of just shutting it on and off his truly remarkable. In the morning I would turn on my HP, make coffee, and if I was lucky it might have made it to the desktop by the time I got back. I then clicked the Firefox icon and went to the bathroom and read War and Peace. When I got back I was on the internet. I'm not even going to mention email. Suffice to say. It wasn't quick.
The other day I went on my wife's HP. It was like stepping out of a Ferrari and into a Model T. Most people, me included, get hoodwinked into believing you get more for your money with a HP, Dell, etc. Yeah you get a bigger screen, more Ram and a bigger Hard Drive. But you also get a plastic piece of crap, constantly updating itself with more crap, capable of catching more viruses then an epidemic of Swine Flu. Honestly; I don't know how the competition stays in business.
The bottom line. When you have one company who designs the computer, the OS, browser, and virus protection, built on a rock solid Unix foundation you can't go wrong. My HP ran Windows XP Firefox browser and McAfee virus protection. It was agonizingly slow with loads of compatibility issues.
To sum it up...The Mac and the HP... the difference between a spaceman and a caveman. 
Apple's slogan should be... Go Mac You Won't Go Back.

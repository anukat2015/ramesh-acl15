Title: bissell  vacuum cleaner
Content:
After I bought it, I wanted to return it because it is heavy. After I read the reviews, I wanted to return it because people said it's not good for bare floor. But I think it's not fair to not give it a chance. I used it on my rug for a few minutes, it did a VERY VERY good job! I haven't tried it on the bare floor yet. I hope it'll work good too. Bissell momentum can clean the rugs,carpet , it already worths the money. 
Four * means very good to me. I will give it 5* if it is lighter and quiter.  I have used many expensive vaccum cleaners, no one can get 5*.  Nothing is perfect,right?

I tried to use it on bare floor, it worked fine. It is very easy to push .
According to the instruction book, the brush will rise up when you use attchments so I guess it won't ruin my floor. But I still like to put a
 rug under it while I use attachments to clean my bed.If the brush not rise up enough, it can clean my rug instead of ruin my floor.

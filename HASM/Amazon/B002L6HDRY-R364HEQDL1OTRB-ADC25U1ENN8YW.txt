Title: Not Worth the Price
Content:
For the amount of money paid for these things, I should be able to listen the radio regardless of what headphones I'm wearing.  I'm one of those people who cannot keep earbuds in her ears.  So, I have to use regular headphones.  Consequently, I cannot listen to the radio.  I have a $60 Walkman MP3 player.  I can listen to the radio no matter what headphones I'm wearing.  Also, again, for the money, iTunes should automatically keep duplicates entries out of the Library.  This is a very substandard product, for the money.  I love the shape and size but I need a much higher capacity.  I hope future generations will address my concerns.

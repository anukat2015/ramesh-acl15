Title: Defective Digital Clock
Content:
Great coffee maker if you don't need the auto brew feature.  I bought this coffee maker to replace my old auto brew model.  The digital clock would randomly reset the time making the auto brew feature useless. I reordered a replacement and had the same problem.

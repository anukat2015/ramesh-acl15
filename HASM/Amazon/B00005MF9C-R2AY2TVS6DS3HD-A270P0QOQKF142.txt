Title: Works For Me
Content:
Got tired of boosting Starbucks' stock and began looking for an inexpensive single-portion coffee maker.  Saw this on Amazon, read the reviews and purchased it.  Have had it for a month now, and I'm truly pleased.  Very compact, and incredibly easy to operate.  Coffee nice and hot, stays so in the provided mug (if one keeps it covered) for a nice long time.  I noted complaints about coffee grounds getting splashed about, and this does happen occasionally (especially if one uses more than the amount recommended).  A quick wipe takes care of the grounds on the water dispenser, and if they get splashed into the reservoir I just run the thing once or twice without the filter and that takes care of the problem (this happens very infrequently).  I'm VERY pleased.  In fact, I'm enjoying a steaming hot mug of yummy homemade coffee as I speak.  Ciao.

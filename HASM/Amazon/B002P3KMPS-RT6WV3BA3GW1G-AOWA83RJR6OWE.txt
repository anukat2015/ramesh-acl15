Title: Great value, performance and ASUS  has a 2 year warranty!
Content:
The first laptop had dark spots in the corner of the display. Amazon next day shipped the replacement. Excellent customer support. This laptop runs great out of the box with only a small about of junk software.  Mainly ASUS applications showing you some of the cool things you can do. Windows 7 so far has impressed me but be aware you will need to do a large amount of updates. (1 gig or better) The HDMI interface works great for connecting your HDTV to play dvd media and web content.  Laptop runs cooler than expected but I still would recommend a good power cooler pad.
This model does not have a blu-ray rom, only the K61IC-X1 does. 
This model you get a faster processor but no blu-ray. 
Thank you for the person that corrected me on this fact.

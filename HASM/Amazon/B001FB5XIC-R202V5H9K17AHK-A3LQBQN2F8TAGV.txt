Title: Best tower heater made
Content:
We have a very cold family room in our basement and this is the only tower heater that ever did the job. The room goes from 58 degrees to 70 degrees in about an hour. It's quiet, looks good, and puts out the heat. We love DeLonhi products and this one is worth every penny spent.

Title: 2 Stars for the front access
Content:
We bought this coffee maker at Target (cheaper on Amazon) and have had it less than 90 days.  It has never seemed to make very hot coffee and now the burner has quit working all together.  I really liked the front access feature, but other than that it was a waste of money.

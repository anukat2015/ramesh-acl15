Title: Fantastic laptop for those wanting something a bit more then a netbook
Content:
I had been debating getting a netbook for over a year but could never justify it even at $300.  The Atom processors were slow even in some general tasks, the keyboards were almost never full sized and those with good battery life had giant batteries sticking out the back.  Finally it seems we are getting more usable alternatives in the new CULV (consumer ultra low voltage) class of laptops.  This Acer meets all of my requirements.  While the Core 2 Solo processor is no speed demon it certainly suits me fine for the weekend trips and coffee shop runs netbook type laptops are intended for.  For maximum performance I highly recommend you upgrade to the latest video and sound drivers and shut Aero off.  The keyboard is full sized and after a couple days of use I am touch typing with ease.  The screen is average but for the price I wasn't expecting a Sony or Apple type LCD.  I wish it wasn't as glossy but I am sure a matte finish would have only highlighted the averageness of the screen.  Battery life is great.  In general use with wifi turned on I was able to get over 6.5 hours and playing full screen xvid videos I got around 5 hours before the battery died.  For $450 this system is a bargain, so called business level ultra portable laptops not too dissimilar to the Acer sold for close to $2000 barely over a year ago.  While not everyone needs an ultra portable laptop I will say anyone looking for one or a netbook for that matter should seriously consider the Acer 1410.

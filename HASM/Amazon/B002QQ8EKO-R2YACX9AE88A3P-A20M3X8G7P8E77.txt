Title: The way computing should be
Content:
After 20 years of Microsoft-based computer use, I finally took the plunge. I've been using my MacBook for a week now, and helping my family with their computers in the past few days (Yeah, I'm the tech guy for the family) I have found myself missing what I can do easier on my Mac.
It is solidly constructed, the user interface is pleasing and intuitive to me. I really like the touchpad. The multi-finger gestures are just brilliant. Why has no one thought of this before now?
I was apprehensive about the keyboard. However it has a very consistent and pleasing feel to type on. The large wrist rest area is quite nice. It is "slick" plastic, though, so in the summer, I might not like it as much. We'll see.
The rubber on the bottom keeps it from sliding on your lap, limits the feeling of cooking your lap that most laptops give you, again, another smart idea.
The display is magnificent. I loaded up some of my pictures and I found myself really enjoying just watching them scroll through in the screen saver. Very sharp and crisp.
My only real gripe so far is that Mac accessories (whether from Apple or 3rd parties) seem over-priced. Not sure why that is. But this is no different than iPod accessories, in my opinion. It's irritating, and requires more shopping to get what you want at a reasonable price.

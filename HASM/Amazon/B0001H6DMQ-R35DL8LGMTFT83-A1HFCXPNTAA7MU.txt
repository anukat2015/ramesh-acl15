Title: Dyson DC 21 Canister vs. Windtunnel Bagless Canister
Content:
I bought both the Dyson DC 21 and Windtunnel Bagless Canister.  Then I did two experiments.  I covered my carpet with dry cat litter.  The Windtunnel did a better job on the carpet.
Then I used the attachments.  The Windtunnel was better.  It had more suction.
Then I emptied the bagless canister.  The Dyson has greater dirt capacity.
The Dyson is easier to push around and is more fun.
The Windtunnel is more compact.

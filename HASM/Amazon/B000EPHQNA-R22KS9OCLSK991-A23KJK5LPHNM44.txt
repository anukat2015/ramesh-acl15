Title: Great....but
Content:
I bought a Nano 2 months ago after owning an IRiver for 4 years.  I loved the Nano until my wife "borrowed" it so I decided to order the shuffle.  I ordered it on September 30 and got it this past week.  A long time to wait but I thought it was only $80 so I could wait.  I charged it on Tuesday night and added a bunch of songs to it.  I have used it quite a bit since Tuesday and still haven't re-charged it.  I really do like it as it is small and clips to my clothes.  Wed, Thur and Fri I ran with the unit and it has been great.  Today I spent the day getting rid of leaves in the backyard for about 2 hours and it clipped to my jeans and never fell off.  I have to say though I really liked having a screen.  I will keep this one for use when working out or mowing or whenever I don't need to change songs.  I will be buying either another Nano or possibly a 30gig IPOD.

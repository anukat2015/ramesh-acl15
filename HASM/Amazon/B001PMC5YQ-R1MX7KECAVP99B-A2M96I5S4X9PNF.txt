Title: Incredibly Versatile Space Heater
Content:
It sounds silly, but the handle on the top of this space heater increases its portability tenfold.  It's very light, and because it only takes one hand to move it around, I'm constantly switching it from the floor to an end table.  The many different heat settings mean that you can be very picky about the heat blasting out at you.
Another feature that I find preferable is that it heats constantly, unlike some space heaters which practically light you on fire but come on only intermittently.  This handy space heater stays at the temperature you choose the entire time.  I've run this thing for 10 hours at a time with no ill effects.  It lasted through last winter and is still going strong this winter.  When I had the flu for a couple of weeks, I hunkered down on my couch with this on the coffee table and baked myself every single night for the entire night.
I adore this thing and I'm about to order another to keep in my office.  (I live in a house that was built in 1825 so it can be a little drafty.  Because all the rooms are small and the house is full of doors just for the purpose of trapping heat, it's more energy efficient for me to squirrel myself away in my office with the door shut and the space heater on than to crank the furnace in the entire house up.

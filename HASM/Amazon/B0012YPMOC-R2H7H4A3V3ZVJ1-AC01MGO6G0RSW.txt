Title: Worth every penny. Be Creative, forget Ipod!
Content:
So little in size, but it does so much.  I "upgraded" from the Creative micro-photo, this is thinner, lighter and does way more.  I didn't need the instructions, menus are so intuitive.  Tons of free podcasts are available, audio and video, through Zencast.  Colors of pictures and videos is superb.  I have a cheap pair of Panasonic earphones and I think the sound is great. Can't wait to listen through a "good" pair!
Downloads are easy and seamless with Amazon Unboxed.  I have a Napster-to-go subscription and I can constantly change my music for only $14 p/mo. Or I could use several other sites...I'm not chained to the pay-per-song/album iTunes store/software. 
I waited a long time to purchase and now am so glad I did. I have only had it for about a month, but can't think of anything I don't like. Definitely get a case and screen protector.  You can get both for under $15.

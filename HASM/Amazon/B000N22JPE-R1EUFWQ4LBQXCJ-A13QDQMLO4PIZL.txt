Title: Didn't last long
Content:
I bought this coffee maker in September 2009 based on good reviews on this website. However, this week I was awakened from a nap with my wife saying she smelled something electrical burning. Not a good way to wake from a nap! The smell filled the entire lower floor of our house. You can imagine our relief, after frantic searching, to find out that it was the coffee pot, not the wires in our wall.
Needless to say, I am disappointed with this coffeemaker. I understand that it's possible to get a lemon on even the best products, and it had worked well up to that point. However, I thought this significant enough to report. You make your own decision

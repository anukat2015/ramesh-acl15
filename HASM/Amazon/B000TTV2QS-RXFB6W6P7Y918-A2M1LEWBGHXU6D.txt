Title: Heats well, but tips easily
Content:
This is a pretty good little heater, but it tips over easily.  Not sure I'd recommend it for people with small kids or big dogs.  A cat would probably be OK around it, though.  I've now had it for three months and use it every day for 1-3 hours.  The main design flaw is that it has no handle, only a molded, recessed area on the top back, meant for one hand.  You actually have to grip the heater with both hands if you intend to move it--one hand on the front to stabilize it and one in the back "slot."  If you get careless and use only one hand (which is what you're supposed to be able to do), the heater easily unbalances and falls over toward the front.  I've also accidentally knocked it over several times while vacuuming the room it's in.  The instability is too bad, because otherwise this is a nice little heater.
The up side is that in spite of being knocked over half a dozen times onto a hardwood floor, it continues to soldier on.
It has lots of options, but basically I just use the ON button and then pick between LO or HI.  The LO setting uses about half as much energy as the HI, so I usually use LO, unless my hands refuse to warm up.  I do not use the heater while I'm sleeping.  I wouldn't trust any space heater enough to do that.  To be on the safe side, I also unplug the heater when it's not in use.  Have read too many horror stories about plugged-in space heaters malfunctioning while off.
In spite of the fact that the Lasko tips over easily, I do like it and am pleased with my purchase.  It puts out a lot of heat and is good for heating only the space I'm in.  Some friends have a similar model and use it to heat half their apartment to a toasty-hot temperature.

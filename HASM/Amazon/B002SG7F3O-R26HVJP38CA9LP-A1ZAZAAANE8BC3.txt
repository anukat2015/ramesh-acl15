Title: US buyers beware
Content:
This product may be a five star item, but I have no idea because it requires 240 volts to run. It's made in England. Perhaps it is noted in the fine print somewhere, but I saw no mention of this, and didn't find out until I had the box in my hands. So anyone in the US looking to buy a small wall mounted heater needs to look elsewhere.

Title: Beautiful, but tall
Content:
This is a beautiful red coffee maker, works well, and makes fine coffee, but it's awfully tall.  In fact, to open the top to get into the basket, I have to move it out from under my cabinets first.  It's not a big deal, but it might be for someone who has limited counter space or cabinets overhanging all the counter space.
Otherwise, it's working well so far!

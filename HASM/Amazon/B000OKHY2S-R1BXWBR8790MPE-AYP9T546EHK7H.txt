Title: Does not do its job, DO NOT recommend
Content:
The strength of the air coming out is very weak and the temperate of the air coming out is only slightly cooler than room temperature. I tried putting ice cold water in the unit as well as a ton of ice and nothing seemed to help. it could not cool a 10X10 room. very disapointed.

Title: iPod with Dock
Content:
This is the first iPod I've owned. While it's not my style to carry it around with buds in my ears, I bought it to work with my Yamaha home stereo system, and it is excellent in that role. The sound of the iTunes mp3's is as good as the original CD's, there is no mess of CD's to deal with any longer, and the iPod itself sits in a Yamaha Universal iPod Dock and can be controlled by the Yamaha remote with on-screen menus. I found it simpler to forego the on-screen option, as finding music and playlists directly on the iPod itself is quick and easy using the click-wheel. And don't forget that the electronic switching is faster, smoother, and quieter than CD turntable switching. I doubt that I will ever use the entire 80 GB capacity, something less would have been plenty, but at the price the high capacity is still a rational purchase. I had read a few negative reviews about this iPod version before I bought one, but now I wonder if these people have too much time on their hands. In my opinion this product is solidly and beautifully made, works perfectly, is easy to use, and well worth what Amazon charges for it. It seems quite durable, but I guess time will tell. For now I could not be more pleased.

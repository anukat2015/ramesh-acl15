Title: Very happy!
Content:
I ordered this because I don't have a lot of counter space in my apartment and I've never been able to measure out the right amount of coffee to make a good-tasting cup.  This maker is perfect!  I ordered flavored pods separately, but I used the regular pods that came with the maker until they arrived.  The pods that come with the machine have a great flavor!  The coffee wasn't too strong and it wasn't too weak.  For the first time in my life, I'm consistently making coffee that tastes good!  My boyfriend really likes the coffee maker, too.  We use bigger mugs and the amount of coffee that comes out is perfect to add milk and not overflow the mug.
The maker arrived very quickly and the seller was great!  I would definitely buy their pods when I run out of my 50 regular ones!  I'm going to try to convince the office manager at my job to buy one for the office!

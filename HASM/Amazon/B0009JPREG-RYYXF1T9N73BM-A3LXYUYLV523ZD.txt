Title: Remarkable. It will surprise you.
Content:
Yes, you will be amazed how fast the digital SLRs develop and what once was not affordable is now within your reach.
It is very hard to fault this camera. The newly released D200, which is twice the price, is only marginally faster and yes, it does have a metal body unlike D70 which is plastic (not cheap plastic, mind you, but a very solid type), but this would be a distinct advantage only to those who really put it in adverse conditions. D200 is also heavier.
D200 also has more conveniently separated creative controls. 
D70 camera is superb, and the maddeningly slow D100 is now firmly out of play and out of date that they should struggle to give it away for free.
Other reviews here have plenty of technical information so I will shut up. Buy this camera NOW. It will make you happy.

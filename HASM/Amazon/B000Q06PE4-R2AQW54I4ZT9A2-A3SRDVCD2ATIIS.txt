Title: $1000 Paper Weight
Content:
When it ran, it was fine.  Immediately after the 1 yr warranty went out, unit quit. Called HP, want $400 just to look at it.  Browsed the internet, the HP dv9000 series has some major problems with the motherboard.
I will not buy another HP.  No more money to them.

Title: Not bad...
Content:
Overall, it's not bad, but I had no reference point because this is my first space heater.  Here are my observations though - 
PROS
- Feels pretty sturdy
- Compact size
- Heats up quickly and adequately (didn't have high expectations either for something so small)
- Not hot to touch
- Can turn off (but I would advise everyone to ALWAYS unplug too!)
CONS
- A tiny bit loud (like low setting fan)
- Handle is difficult to hold heater by (you might as well pick up from bottom!)

Title: Great Camera for the Price!
Content:
Awesome features, but don't buy the package with the "kit lens".  The XTi is not an "L-Series Quality" Digital SLR, but with Canon's unlimited choice of superior lenses for the XTi, you will shoot like a pro before you know it. Buy the camera body and decide which lens works best for you.  I chose to get the inexpensive, EF 50mm f/1.8 II, for starters (April 2007).  If you want a quality lens for under $100, this is a must-have in your arsenal.  Sure it has a plastic housing and doesn't look sophisticated, but the optics are the same as the much more expensive 50mm f/1.4 lens!  My wife and I have taken over one thousand pix already with this camera & lens since April.  We couldn't be happier with the versatility and quality that this camera is capable of producing!  Thanks Canon.

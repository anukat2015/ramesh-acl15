Title: Great price, great camera
Content:
This is my first digital SLR. I had a minolta 700 for years. 
This camera does everything that my 35 mm film camera did and more. It is a lot lighter than I expected. Pictures are stunning. Focus is fast and quiet. 
If you are not a pro this is the camera for you. I would suggest the D30 if you are a pro.
Amazon beat all the others in price. Standard shipping brought it to my house in two days.

Title: Worse vaccuum I ever had
Content:
There are so many things I don't like about this vacuum I don't know where to begin.  Its heavy.  It's attachments are small and cheaply made.  I ordered a separate floor attachment for my bare floors but I still have to stoop over to use it and the tube collapses whenever I put any pressure on it. And because the hose is too short, I end up pulling the whole vacuum over in the floor.  It is dirty and dust accumulates all over the outside of it.  I usually end up vacuuming the outside of the vacuum.  When you change the filters, do it outside.  As far as the canister lifting off, I wish they had just put wheels on it and I could just use it as a real canister vacuum.  I guess I will end up buying another vacuum because this one is virtually useless to me but I won't get a Bissell again.  My other vacuums have lasted at least 10 years.  My one star is for the motor.  It does have incredible suction.  Its so good that it ate the binding off my rug!

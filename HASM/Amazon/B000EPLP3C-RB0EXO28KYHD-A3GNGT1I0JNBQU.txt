Title: For what it's worth from a Novice
Content:
I am a grandmother who is not all that knowledgeable about all the new electronic gizmos on the market.  However, I purchased this digital music player to use while at the gym--specifically because it had access to an FM tuner while some of the other players do not have this feature.  I am very pleased with the quality, performance and ease of operation.  Even I can "rip" CDs and download music choices from the internet (my son would be shocked).  It is a bit heavy and I have not tried it at the gym yet as I have not found an appropriate arm band or other means to carry it.  The availability of accessories at local stores is sorely lacking. 
Everything considered, I really like the Zune and enjoy listening to it while at work.  I would recommend the Zune.  I'm glad I took one more forray into the electronic age with this product.

Title: Really good SLR and good price!
Content:
The Canon EOS Rebel T1i is really great and has alot of fun features, and you got to love the 15.1 MP. Amazing camera. I wasn't to thrilled with the EF-S 18-55mm lense that came with it. I highly recommend you get the Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 II instead. But really great camera, great video as well, great pictures, decent flash, and easy to operate controls.

Title: Best Coffee Maker in Years
Content:
This coffe maker is ideal in every way.  I make 2-3 pots of coffee each day.  It is easy to use and has ample space to pour water into reserviour. I especially like the idea that it comes with a water filtration system as well as a push button to open the filter tray.  I agree with an earlier review . . . Braun does not tell you what the code number is for the filter!  All in all, this coffeemaker makes a great cup of coffee.

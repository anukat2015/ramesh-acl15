Title: Marvellous
Content:
I bought mine to use with the Monitor Audio i-deck speaker system and so far I can't fault it. Its very easy to use and the sound quality is excellent with this setup. 
Currently I'm ripping my CD collection at 256kbps, which produces near CD quality. My only quibble is that it takes a long time for itunes to rip the CD's - but this may be my incompetence rather than anything to do with the product. However, once the iPod is connected songs are uploaded very quickly. 
I haven't tried the provided earphones yet, but from what other users have said these are not worth bothering with. Compared with a previous HDD/mp3 player I bought this is vastly superior in every respect, and I now understand why Apple dominate the market for these players.

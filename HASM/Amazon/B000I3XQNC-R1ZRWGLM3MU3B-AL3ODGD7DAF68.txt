Title: One Great Camera
Content:
This is no doubt the best camera I have ever used.  It produces striking images in spite of my inexperience.  My first pictures with the XTi were at a family picnic and many of the photos would rival professional portraits.  It was effortless to get stop motion pictures at the family baseball games where the baseball was frozen in flight and the subjects were in sharp focus.  Almost all the pictures I took have that WOW factor and the rest were better than normal.
I took a lot of pictures at the picnic expecting to discard most of them, as I had to do in the past with my old digital camera.  Well now we need more disk space because we want to keep the majority of the pictures.  I used both the automatic picture type settings and semi-automatic settings with great results.  The field guide I bought with the camera took the fear out of using the SLR style camera which turns out to be as easy as any point and shoot camera I have used.
We used to miss shots because the old camera took several seconds to be ready when it was powered on and in between shots. The Canon XTi is almost instantly on and will take 3 frames a second.  It is much faster than I can react so now I have not missed any shots because the camera was not ready.
Buy this one it is worth every nickel.

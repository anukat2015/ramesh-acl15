Title: Pentax K100 Great first D-SLR
Content:
This is my first foray into the digital SLR world. I have always had Pentax film cameras (K1000, and ME Super) and have loved their quality. I've read that the new DSLR's use the same lens mount as the 35mm camera body so it made the most sense to stick with Pentax. In retrospect, old lenses don't play well with the new auto settings of the digital camera, and new lenses are designed to work specifically with your digital camera body. If you have an assortment of Pentax compatible lenses it may still make sense to stick with the same brand in the digital world. However, in retrospect I wouldn't have given this single factor so much weight in my decision, since I won't likely use any of them unless I intend to do a lot of the manual camera work in my head. I should say that the Anti-shake feature is "in" the camera body for Pentax, as opposed to the lens for Nikon. I really like this feature and has proven to help take sharp photos in low light lighting and is a plus if you do intend to use your old lenses. Overall I am very happy with this camera, I am a casual photographer and the 6MP is more than I need for the type of shooting I like to do.

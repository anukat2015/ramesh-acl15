Title: Fast, Fast, Fast!!!!
Content:
I only make coffee at home on the weekends and I had the typical 4-cup drip drip type coffee maker.  Problem was it took so damn long for it to make a pot of coffee--I was having caffeine withdrawal waiting for it to finish brewing.  This Fabreware 4-cup maker is SUPER FAST.  By the time I get my cup out of the cupboard an the milk out of the fridge and sit down it's done brewing--yes, it's THAT fast!  Plus, it's extremely high-quality, thick stainless steel.  It's quite a beautiful little pot that I now keep out on the countertop.  Actually, the best part of it is my parents always had Fabreware percolators when I was growing up and this brings back a lot of memories of them everytime I sit down for my weekend coffee (sniff!)

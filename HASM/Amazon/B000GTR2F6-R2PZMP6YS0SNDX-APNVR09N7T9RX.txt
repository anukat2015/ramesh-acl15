Title: keurig B70
Content:
Just received this coffee maker and was so excited to try it.  Primed it according to instructions then turned it off until morning.  In the morning when I tried to make coffee it kept shutting itself off.  When I tried to access the menu to see if it was on auto off the menu screen would not come up.  After several attempts was able to make 1 partial cup of coffee then machine started to smell "hot" and turned itself off again.  I am returning it and since I love the idea of how convenient it is to have fresh coffee each time I want a cup I will try it one more time and hope that I have better luck.  Right now I give it 2 stars for looks and ease of use.

Title: Love It
Content:
The Zojirushi thermal carafe coffee maker is the best coffee maker we've ever had. The coffee tastes great, even if you do use cold water, which some reviewers have noted doesn't produce the best coffee. The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot and you don't have that burnt coffee smell from the coffee sitting too long on the warming plate. All in all, a great buy.

Title: Love the shuffle!
Content:
Being a relatively new Ipod user, I bought the Ipod video first and then decided to get the shuffle to use when I'm on my treadmill.  The shuffle is completely user friendly.  It's really amazing how many songs it can hold.  The setup was very simple.  The only thing that surprised me was the amount of time that it took to charge it the first time.  Other than that, the process was a piece of cake.  For the price, it is the best Ipod on the market!  I recommend it to anyone new to Ipods for its simplicity of use alone.  
I would recommend, however, getting better earphones if you are going to be exercising with it.  It comes with the factory issue kind which are not friendly to anyone moving around a lot.

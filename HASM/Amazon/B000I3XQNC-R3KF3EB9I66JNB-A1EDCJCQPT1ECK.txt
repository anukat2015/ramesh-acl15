Title: Great camera, well worth the upgrade from XT
Content:
I bought this recently and its a great camera, well worth the upgrade from the Rebel XT. The lens sensor has a noticeable difference when used with quality lens. If you're looking for a reasonably priced SLR camera, this is the one to get.

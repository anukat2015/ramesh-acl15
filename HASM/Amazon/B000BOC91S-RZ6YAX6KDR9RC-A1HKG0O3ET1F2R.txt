Title: Nice portable cooler
Content:
This is a well constructed good working evaporative cooler.  It holds lots of water and the water dissapears fairly quickly so I know its working.  It is somewhat large but can be moved room to room easily.  Much more efficient than an AC window air conditioner.  It has 3 speeds that do either fan only or fan with water being pumped so it can be used like a box fan.

Title: Excellent performance for the price point
Content:
I was considering the Kenmore Intuition 28014 canister vac b/c of the Consumer Reports review, but it is pricey and user reviews suggested build quality issues and expensive replacement bags. I did some research and the Hoover S3765 was relatively inexpensive, had good user reviews, and did well on pet hair tests. 
Pros: I have a double-coated dog (which means lots of shedding) -- The Hoover S3765 does a great job picking up pet hair from carpet that my old vac missed. Seriously, my husband and I were amazed (and grossed out) with the amount of fur in the dirt cup after a couple of passes over a small area of carpet. Other features include variable suction control, electronic control buttons on the handle, HEPA filter, telescopic wand, easy to empty dirt cup, light weight canister, and stair, bare floor, and crevice attachments. The vac is also fairly quiet -- my dog would run and hide when I hauled out the old vac. She doesn't seem to care when the S3765 is running and will continue snoozing away. 
Cons: For me, none so far. The dirt cup does fill quickly, but it's not a pain to empty. The unit seems solid, but some reviewers noted issues with parts breaking -- hasn't happened to my unit yet, so I can't comment on that. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.

Title: awesome camera
Content:
everything is great about this camera.  for the entry-level dslr, this is as good as it gets.  it is small enough for the prosumer, yet big enough to feel solid and luxurious.  the screen is also 3 inches, which is a big plus.  the camera can suit a variety of people, ranging from beginners with the automatic modes, to the advanced amateur, with full manual modes for your pleasure.  i love it!

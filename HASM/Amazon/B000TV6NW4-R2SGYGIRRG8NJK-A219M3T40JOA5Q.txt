Title: Great inexpensive coffee pot
Content:
The carafe pours smoothly without dripping all over everything and the basket cover drip is stopped by steam release vents. The cone filter improves coffee flavor and eliminates the grounds from overflowing. Now I don't ask myself if I really turned off the coffee pot after I leave. I have experienced a black charred carafe but no more potential fires. It has the coffee ready in the morning giving me extra precious minutes. The basket placement issue is easily solved by leaving the carafe off the hot plate until the basket is properly installed. The black stainless is sharp and does not show the coffee stain that makes the white look dirty. Love this inexpensive pot and bought a second one to improve my daily experience while at our cabin.

Title: Bad experience
Content:
I had looked forward to using this vacuum. However, it turned out to be a frustrating experience, because I could not remove the the power nozzle from the extension wand. Thus I was unable to use any of the other attachments. The phone consultant was of no help, and it was a long time before I received an email response.By that time, I had managed to cram the vacuum into its carton-difficult because I could not completely remove the power nozzle-and return it to Amazon. I have stopped payment on this product.

Title: Frustrated with customer service
Content:
While I loved this vacuum for about six months, I'm now ready to smash it. Initially I was thrilled because it was quiet and powerful, and then one day it inexplicably started turning itself off after a minute or two of vacuuming. Trying to reach customer service was a fiasco, after over an hour on the phone I reached someone who told me it's overheating, a common problem, and that I could send it back and they'd replace a PC board or some such thing. He assured me he'd send me the info to return it via mail, and that it would take about a week to fix with travel time. Well... I waited over a week and no paperwork arrived. I called again... I get someone who referred me to an appliance repair place (which I called, they don't even handle vacuum cleaners). When I pressed him on it, telling him I was told last week that it would be repaired by Bosch at the company's expense, he told me he'd let someone know to get the return info to me asap. Then he hung up. After I waited on hold for over a half hour to talk to someone. I guess we'll see if the info arrives this week? In the meantime, I have a house with two kids, two dogs and three cats... and no vacuum. Best of luck to you if you buy this vacuum... if it needs repair, you're going to pull your hair out. Also, good luck finding a phone number to talk to an actual PERSON... it took me all morning to track that down. Here it is, if you need it: 1-800-921-9622.

Title: Great DSLR package!
Content:
I've had this camera for about a month now and have really enjoyed it.  I'm new to SLR cameras, but I must say that it is very easy to use.  With the automatic settings alone, anyone could take great pictures.  I have used several of the preset shooting modes, and all have worked wonderfully.  I've also tried a few shots with the time lapse, which have also turned out great.  We recently spend a day beach hopping south of the Los Angeles area and I ended up taking about 320 shots.  95% of them turned out great and the other 5% weren't anything to do with the camera.  I'm planning on taking a digital SLR class to learn how to use some of the manual and advanced features a little better.  The two lens combo has proven to be well worth the money.  I could not be more pleased.

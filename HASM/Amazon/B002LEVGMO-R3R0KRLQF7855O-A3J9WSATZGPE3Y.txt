Title: Great laptop, frustrating keyboard
Content:
The keyboard keys are all flush and too close together.  I understand Acer probably did this to make it a full size keyboard, but it's a pain when typing.  Fingers slip off, hit other keys, very frustrating.  I've found it makes typing quite difficult.  Keys on a standard keyboard are smaller at the top than the bottom, providing for some separation between them.    I also own two smaller Acer One Aspire netbooks (8.9" and 10.1") and actually find it easier to type on those keyboards, even though they're smaller.  If it wasn't for the keyboard, I'd give it 5 stars.

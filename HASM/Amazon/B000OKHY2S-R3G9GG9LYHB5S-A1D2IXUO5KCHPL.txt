Title: This product is worthless
Content:
This product actually made my room warmer and very humid.  You spend all your time filling it with ice and water which is the opposite of what you want in the air.  It works against the a/c unit and results in a warmer more humid room.  I wish I had never bought it I don't even use it.  I am hoping it will serve as a large humidifier in the winter so I did not waste my money completely.

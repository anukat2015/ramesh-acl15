Title: Hate where USB port and DVD drive are located
Content:
My new PC arrived yesterday. While it is a laptop, it will be used in my office, meaning it will be hooked up to a printer and external drive and other peripherals. This Sony replaces a Toshiba that I was very happy with, but it was over 5 years old, and the new PC has a lot to offer (more RAM, more disc, better graphics card). However, I can only give it 4 stars because the 3 USB ports are all on the right side, at the front. This means that my mouse (yes, I prefer to use one rather than the touch pad, and I'm right-handed) has to navigate around the printer and other wires. I almost have to unplug everything to load a CD/DVD - the wires are in the way. If the DVD drive and the USB ports had been switched, I would be a very happy camper. Now I have to decide if this is something I can live with... My Toshiba had the CD drive open toward me - very convenient, and the plugs (power and USB) were all in the back - perfectly out of my way. The next time I buy a PC, I'll make a point to go see it in person. Sure, the pictures showed me where the ports were, but it's very different when you have the machine sitting in front of you.

Title: I love it!
Content:
I'm really happy with this machine.  In two minutes (the first cup takes 2 minutes because the water has to heat up, but the next cups takes seconds) I have a great cup of coffee.  The K-cups are a little expensive, but before I'd make a pot of coffee and throw half of it out.  I found a box of 80 cups at BJ's for $37.  I've looked online and you can do a bit better.  
We just renovated our kitchen and the stainless machine looks so much better than the other plastic Keurig models.
Only negative - I got a bit of a metal taste the first 8-10 cups, but now it's gone.  And, on the next model they should figure out a way to make the water chamber a bit bigger.  I'm refilling it a lot, but honestly not that big of a deal.

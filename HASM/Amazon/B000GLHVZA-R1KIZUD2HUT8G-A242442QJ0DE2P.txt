Title: Now this is what i call a heater
Content:
So much nice than the DeLonghi TCH8590ER 34-Inch Ceramic Tower Heater that I bought a few days before. The Vornado heats up a room quickly and quietly. Excellent analogue controls means no resetting if the power dips or goes out. Simple and easy operation. No silly glowing night lights that are far too bright, no silly black dials, just a solid heater. Highly recommended.

Title: Very disappointing
Content:
After wearing out my faithful old Cuisinart coffeemaker, I decided to go with this particular Mr. Coffee model as a replacement for my old friend.
As others have mentioned, it does leak water onto my counter top. Not enough to make a big mess, but I am constantly scrubbing under the coffeemaker to get the coffee colored imprint off the counter.
Using the pause and pour feature isn't working out for me.  Until the carafe has been on the warming plate for a while, the coffee isn't actually hot enough to drink.  The coffee is often bitter.  There have been several times where the grind basket has overflowed because the carafe wasn't put back exactly right after using the pause and pour feature.
Standard coffee filters do not hold up well in the filter basket.  For the first few weeks that I owned the machine, the coffee brewed was full of grinds because the filters collapsed in on themselves during the brew cycle.  I thought maybe it was the brand of filters being used, so I tried three different brands, all with the same results.  Now I have to use two filters at a time so that they do not collapse during the brew cycle.
The most recent problem just started last week.  I usually put in a little over ten cups of water (a little more to offset the leakage and the tons of steam that come out during the brew cycle)and the coffeemaker "thinks" it's done brewing after only producing two cups.  As I am writing this, I am still waiting for the pot that I started half an hour ago to finish brewing.

Title: Keeps Me Warm in the Dorm
Content:
It's been a COLD winter, but this heater sure has helped.  Very powerful, it easily heats up my dorm room and keeps me comfortable.  Quiet and portable enough to carry in a backpack to other rooms.  I like that it will also double as a ventilating fan in the summer.

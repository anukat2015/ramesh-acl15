Title: Cusinart self-grinding coffeemaker
Content:
I've had one for some months. While I love its functionality except that there's a HUGE downside---DAILY cleanout of the chute from the grinder. The instructions say """periodic"""" but that's false. I was told by Cuisinart that I needed to use less oily (light roast) Arabica beans. That made NO difference.
So, if you don't mind daily disassembly of the coffeemaker do buy it.

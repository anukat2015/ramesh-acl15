Title: Cuisinart DGB-600 coffeemaker
Content:
Good Points Over My Past Coffeemakers: 
- I love the taste of freshly ground coffee. 
- The built-in grinder works well.  
- Beeping tells you when coffee is ready.
- Nice design and looks great.
Bad Points Over My Past Coffeemakers:
- Cannot tell amount coffee left in thermal carafe.
- Coffee pours out slowly from carafe and drips all over countertop or whatever is underneath it.
- Carafe requires you to pour at a steeper angle which I think causes it to leak down past the pour spout all over everything.
- The grinder in very loud for about 30~40 seconds when grinding.
- I find I have to clean more than my old machine, I clean the grinder, grinder lid and coffee ground basket every time I make a pot of coffee oh yes and the carafe.
My number one complaint about the coffeemaker is the drip problem I have every time I pour a cup of coffee. This is very messy and aggravating.  
The taste is wonderful but they will have to fix the drip problem or I will have to convert back to my old coffeemaker.............glad I didn't throw it away!!

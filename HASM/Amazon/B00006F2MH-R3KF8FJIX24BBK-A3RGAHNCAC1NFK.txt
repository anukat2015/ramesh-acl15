Title: Cuisinart Grind and Brew
Content:
Esthetically pleasing so it works well in the kitchen; it is easy to program and operate. It seems to anticipate your every need and provide an easy solution. The directions are coherent and in detailed English. I am just crazy about this product, and have used both the provided basket as well as disposable paper filters - both work well. The only down side I can name is the loud grinder -if you program it to go off before you are awake, it is startling. After a few mornings, you won't notice it, but the first morning, I thought there was a fire somewhere because of the high-pitched hum the grinder emitted -for less than a minute.

Title: The Coffee maker to end all coffee makers - The mother of all Coffee makers
Content:
This thing works great! I have had my share of the cheapo Wal-Mart plastic coffee makers that work great for 3 or 4 pots then start a gradual decline in :
1.) The amount of coffee produced vs. the amount of water put in, and 
2.) The quality of the coffee produced.
This coffee maker worked perfectly and is still going strong 2 months later. 
This is also one of the fastest coffee makers I have ever owned! 
Fantastic! 
Perfect for those mornings when you don't have a lot of time to wait around for your typical coffee maker to slowly wake up and dribble coffee into your cup , as you stare at the clock anxiously, wondering if you're going to make it to work on time.
This unit starts pouring coffee out about 5 seconds after you put the water in!
I have not had a bad pot out of it yet. 
This coffee maker is highly recommended.

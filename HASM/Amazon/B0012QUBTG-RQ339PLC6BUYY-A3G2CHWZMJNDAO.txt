Title: Needs ergonomic improvement
Content:
It works well for a small bedroom but don't use it for a living room. Also, I tried to carry it one day while it was cold and dropped it with the bottom facing down. Because they're made of cheap plastic, two of the casters broke! Only one side has a handle, not the onther side, so it was easy to slip from my hand and drop. Finally, you should know that while the unit does work, it takes several hours to heat a room up.

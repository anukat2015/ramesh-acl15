Title: Will be a classic
Content:
I shot film for many years. Had a change of careers and was out of photography for a while. Then got back into it with digital. This is my third digital camera and my second DSLR. I used Nikons for many years but, knowing Minolta lenses are just as good and often better than Nikon or Canon or other brands, I took advantage of the momentary panic when Minolta lenses were cheap. I had also used Sony digital cameras with Zeiss optics and enjoyed the image quality, product quality and industrial design. I had also used Sony video equipment in professional settings and knew Sony made great stuff. Also, Nikon cameras use Sony sensors.
Now that Sony has fully taken over Minolta and is doing nice work and being innovative, I picked up the A700 on sale. 
It is a terrific camera. But if you are new to photography and new to SLR photography, you might be better off starting with an A200 or A300 (or their successors if you read this a few months or years later). Then in a few years, pick up an A700 used or its successor (A750?)
In short, the A700 is an excellent DSLR camera. Combined with classic Minolta or new Sony lenses, you will have great results. For Sony lenses I have the 28mm and the 50mm Macro. Both are excellent. The rest of my lenses are Minolta or Konica Minolta zooms (for a brief time, Minolta combined with Konica before selling to Sony). I hope to pick up some of the newer Sony G or Zeiss lenses in time. But if you are just shooting for fun, the basic zoom is fine to start, then see what you like to shoot and get a "prime" like the 50 Macro.

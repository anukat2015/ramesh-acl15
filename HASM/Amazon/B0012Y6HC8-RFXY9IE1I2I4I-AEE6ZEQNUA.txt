Title: Good for a beginner
Content:
I am a complete photography amateur...I take a lot of pictures of passable quality. I decided that I wanted to learn to take better photos, did my homeowrk and decided that the Canon Rebel was the best for me. I haven't so much gone by the book as I have experimented with different features. The camera is user friendly, so I can figure out what I want and need to do quickly. The bottom line is that my still amateur photography has improved drastically because of this camera, and the camera itself has encouraged me to experiment with photography. Great quality has led to great fun!

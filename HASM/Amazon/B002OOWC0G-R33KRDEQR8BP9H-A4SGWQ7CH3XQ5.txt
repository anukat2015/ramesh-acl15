Title: Almost Perfect
Content:
When I bought this computer I was looking for a fast, portable laptop with long battery life.  It's also nice that the battery (lasts about 5-6 hrs. depending on what you're doing) doesn't stick out the back at all, but only slightly out the bottom, giving the computer a nice incline for typing on flat surfaces.  This laptop is all that plus it looks really cool in white (which is what I got).  The only downsides are that there is no CD/DVD drive, and the speakers are really quiet. On 100% volume you can hear if you're in a quiet room by yourself. Be careful to turn the volume back down before plugging in headphones though, because the volume on the headphones is really loud (I put the volume on 10% while using headphones). The computer stays pretty cool and you can't hear the fan running really loud or fast.  My old laptop was a 12" HP tablet, and it started having problems from overheating (which is a common problem with smaller laptops), but this one stays much cooler.  It is also really lightweight.
With Windows 7, my computer can shutdown and start up in under about 10 seconds each. 
I would recommend this laptop to anyone who needs to use it for email or work on-the-go. I wouldn't recommend it to play games or watch movies on, since it lacks a CD/DVD drive and good speakers.

Title: K20D purchase
Content:
I upgraded from the K10d and  expected just a minor tweak to the hardware.  The upgrades are there  but I was really surprised by the  more saturated colors. I thought my  polarizer was at fault...but i wasn't using it! It still underexposes about 1 fstop like the K10D(no biggy). I bought  this for a second camera for wedding photography (can't get by with one camera...too dangerous). With 4 megapixels more resolution to  play with I can also get by with shooting in horizontal  position and doing cropping to vertical format in many cases. Makes life simpler than shooting vertically  1/2 the time. Noise control is way better at 800 ISO too (Good for dark churches). Haven't tried 1600 ISO yet. As always Pentax Rocks!!! I got the cheapest(legitimate!) price I could find anywhere right on Amazon. Beware the cheapo websites they are *not real* prices.

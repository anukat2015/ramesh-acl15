Title: Great little cheap coffee maker
Content:
I love the turn on and off switch without the bells and whistles.  I also have hard water, but we use distilled/purified or spring bottled water in the maker - so their is not the build up of lime in the structure.  Easy to clean with vinegar.  Simple model, we keep it unplugged after it's done to prevent it from overheating (if in case it ever did) - then it lasts a bit longer.  Of course we find the 12 cup only equates to about 4 of our mug sizes - but then, it's good for it's size.

Title: The perfect Camera
Content:
I am no pro photographer but I love to take pictures of vacations, some nature and my family. My grandson stated T-ball this past year and the old Coolpix was just not good enough for distance and fast paced action. Boy am I glad I purchased this camera, it's easy to use, small, light and it is attractive to say the least. The extra lens is perfect for a beginner like me as it's all I'll ever need. And, most importantly or certainly just as important, the pictures are excellent, no make that outstanding Quality. Is there such a thing as a "Professional Point and Shoot Camera"? I don't know but if there is such a thing the Nikon D40x is it!

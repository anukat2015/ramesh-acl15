Title: The best money I've spent
Content:
I almost didn't buy this vacuum due to some of the negative reviews, but my niece has one and loves it.  I figured if I didn't like it, I could always send it back....However, I also love it.  We have two large dogs and I was looking for something that would pick up the dog hair, etc. on a daily basis.  This thing is great.  It is convenient, has good suction, and a lasting charge.  I use my Dyson every week and my Kruz on a daily basis.  My home has never been so clean.  Very highly recommended.

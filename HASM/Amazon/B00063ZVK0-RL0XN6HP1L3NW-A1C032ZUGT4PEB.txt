Title: Heat good, not too quiet
Content:
My main concern with this product was that it wasn't too noisy, because I'm a light sleeper. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it failed the test. It did seem to warm the room in a uniform manner, but had what I can only describe as a "rumbling hum" that was annoying. To be honest, it's not as loud as say, a window air conditioner, but I guess it was the type of sound that I found bothersome. I think Vornado has a pretty good reputation for their products, but for the price, I think this one came up short.

Title: It stopped working
Content:
I bought the coffee maker about a year ago and it was wonderful. The coffee is excellent that they have to offer also. After 1 year of use, my coffee maker just up and quit working. It would not heat the water no more or put the water through the maker. I could not find my receit to get a replacement, and the coffee maker was past the warrenty, so I just threw it out and bought a different one at the local store. The coffee maker is very elegant looking and with the stainless steel covering, gives a kitchen a very elegant look. Other than it just up and quit, I really liked the coffee maker. As for the coffee that they offer, I fell in love with the flavor. This coffee is the best I have ever tasted. You at least need to try just one to see how it tastes. You will never believe the wonder flavor it has. Unbelievable flavor.

Title: Hey, Nice camera!
Content:
I was a 10D user for about 1.5 years.  The 10D takes great pictures so why bother upgrading right?  Well, now that I have messed around with the 20D a bit it was clearly the right choice... although not totally perfect.  
The useful improvements for me have been 1. Faster time from turning on the camera to taking a picture.  It's virtually instantaneous.  The 10D took a few seconds to get going.  2.  Faster writing to the CF card.  This feature is nice when you are in a hurry to take several shots and then get the pics to your computer.  3.  Built-in black and white mode that allows for photo filters to be digitally applied in camera with pretty darn good results.  Although I prefer to apply filters in Photoshop.  4.  The taller pop-up flash works better with my 17-40mm canon lens.  The 10D would leave a half circle blackout between 17-24mm due to the top of the lens blocking the flash.  The taller pop-up flash shoots right over it.  5.  Super low noise at ISO400 and ISO800.  It's even pretty good at ISO1600.  With ISO expansion on you can go to 3200 but it was pretty grainy.  My 10D shows noise at 400 and above.  
Things I didn't realize were going to happen:  My digital workflow is a bit messed up now.  I usually shoot in RAW, and I use the Macintosh OS to process images.  Image capture application in MAC OS 10.3.5 does not support the raw files (now .CR2 files instead of .CRW files in the 10D).  10.3.6 update now allows image capture to recognize the .CR2 files, but it won't build previews for them.  That means you have to use a file browser to manage the files.  iPhoto will not read the .CR2 files.  The new Camera Raw Plug-in (v2.3) for Photoshop CS supports the 20D images (but is not on the list of supported cameras.)  So I now use the Photoshop CS filebrowser to look at my files and figure out which ones are good.  However, I still can't build icon previews for the .CR2 files so it's a bit hard to find the pics you want in a file folder.  I make contact sheets for each shoot and store them with the raw files.  None of these problems exist if you shoot in any of the .JPG modes.
My top five good things and my one bad thing.  I'm sure the one bad thing will go away after the camera has been out a while and becomes more popular.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who's graduated from their Digital Rebel and is wanting more.  
3-2-05 **** update:  iPhoto now supports .CR2 files directly from the camera or a CF card reader.  You can drag them to your photoshop icon in the doc to edit the original or you can set a preference to have the jpg preview from iPhoto open in photoshop with a double click.  iPhoto, image capture, Digital photo professional, phtoshop CS, photoshop 7, photoshop elements 2, 3 still will not build icon previews viewable in the finder for .CR2 files as of this update.  At least iPhoto will allow me to browse photos without having to open them in DPP.

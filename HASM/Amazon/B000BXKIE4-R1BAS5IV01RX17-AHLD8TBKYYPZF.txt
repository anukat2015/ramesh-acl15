Title: Pricey but excellent machine
Content:
We use this vacuum in a 4 story rowhouse in the city; mostly wood floors and tight spaces. Does great on the wood with just the long brush attachment, don't even need the power head. But does great on dog fur in carpeted areas as well, with the loud, effective powerhead. Not good for a bigger suburban McMansion.  A bit heavy, but easily maneuvered on the floor. No dust emission, variable suction and relatively quiet operation  make this $400 machine worth the money.

Title: UNSAFE HEATER - BEWARE
Content:
I plugged this unit into two different outlets in my home and it overloaded my circuit.  It was the only thing plugged into the outlet.  I'm glad I didn't leave it unattended.  I have another Lasko heater and have never had this problem with it.  Too bad b/c the look of this heater is great.  But my safety is more important.

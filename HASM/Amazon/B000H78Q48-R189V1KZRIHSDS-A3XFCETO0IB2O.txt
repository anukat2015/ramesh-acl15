Title: Don't Buy This Product
Content:
Although a great and humane idea, this bug vac is not built to last. We've had it less than a year, and it's nearly dead. Parts have cracked, the AC connector came loose, and now we get about 5 minutes use from a day-long charge. We'll just rely on our regular vaccum, which is bagless and--although giving the bugs a bit of a ride--enables us to release them outside.
We would also warn folks in the south that this thing has trouble with serious bugs--like the so-called palmetto bugs we get in South Florida. They are too big and strong to be easily sucked into this device.

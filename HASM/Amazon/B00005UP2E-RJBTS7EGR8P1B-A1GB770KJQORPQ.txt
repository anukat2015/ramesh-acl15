Title: Great vacuum cleaner - again
Content:
Just replaced our 10+ years old Breeze. It still worked but not as well. The Breeze is so lightweight and easy to use. Take it out for small pickups and the stairs effortlessly.  Great suction on hardwood floors and area rugs. Very good for my back and my budget.

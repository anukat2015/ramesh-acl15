Title: Total Safety Hazard!!!
Content:
I had two of these heaters for about a month.  The heaters would never stay on for more than 15-30 minutes at a time.  One of the heaters malfunctioned and sparks came shooting out of my electrical outlet where the heater was plugged in.  I quickly unplugged it and thank God it didn't catch anything on fire.  I decided to be safe and unplug the one in my bedroom.  I'm glad I did because the plastic around the plug was black, not a light gray like it's supposed to be.  I will never, ever buy these heaters again.

Title: Worst mp3 player
Content:
First, it is not supported by my windows media 2002.
Second, the Zune software is super difficult to navigate. It always
tries to load everything on my hard drive. 
Third, it can not play wma files downloaded from our library. So stupid!
My creative ones work very well for that purpose. 
Garbage!

Title: Save your money
Content:
I purchased this SPT model in late March and eagerly awaited the warm weather,so I could enjoy the benefit of air conditioning this summer. No matter how low I set the thermostat,the temperature never goes below 79 degrees,even after it has been running all day. Even set at its' lowest point which is 62 degrees,it continues to cool at 79. This unit has been a big,expensive disappointment. Don't waste your money. Check out reviews on other brand naames.

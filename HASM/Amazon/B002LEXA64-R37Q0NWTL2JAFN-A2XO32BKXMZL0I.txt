Title: Found what I was looking for.
Content:
Had been looking for a netbook/smaller notebook to use at school to do powerpoint presentations as well as travel with.  Netbooks seemed a little too small then I saw the 11.6 notebooks.  After much searching and comparing I decided on the Acer1410. (A colleague has the Gateway 11.6) I was looking for 2G ram, 250G HD, a faster processor and good battery life.  Got it all with the Acer 1410.  For my needs Vista is good for now, besides after running the compatibility test I didn't want to have to start changing everything to put WIndows 7 on.  
This machine is fast, crystal clear screen, and the full-size keyboard is perfect for paws like mine.  I used it this weekend and when I opened it up it showed 7+ hrs of battery life. 
Can't believe people complain about it being a fingerprint magnet! Wipe it off or be more careful handling it.  
Need a small, fast, powerful notebook? Acer 1410-8414 is it.

Title: Unusual Solution
Content:
Have had the unit 1 month now. Wanted to wait until after the honeymoon to give an opinion, as we kept our last coffeemaker over 20 years (B&D Spacesaver). I agree that the only tangible flaw is the filler system. You have to fill the container and then pour through a well designed dripless spout into a small channel in the back corner of the unit. First week I never did it without spilling, but later found that if you simply hang the edge of the spout on the rim of the channel - the perfect pour. BETTER SOLUTION: Our sink has a seperate filtered water faucet. I took an 18 inch tube that quickly plugs onto the spout and hangs in the fill channel so you simply turn on the faucet and watch the gauge all while you are refilling the coffee basket. Tube coils neatly and hides behind the unit. Goofy 'eh? I drive my wife crazy with stuff like this...

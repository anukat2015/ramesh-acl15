Title: Zunetabulous!
Content:
I got this to replace my 1GB Ipod Shuffle. I am thoroughly impressed! It is small and has a case that protects it well enough. I have even been able to take all of the CD's out of my car and just carry this,(no more filling up the disc changer for trips!). I think the battery life could be better(yes, backlight settings, etc. are @ a minimum and still with using it maybe 2-3 hours daily, the battery life is halved.) The software was a snap to install and unlike Apple's software, my music library isn't replicated(HATE THAT SO MUCH!!!) I also like the fact I can sync this w/a laptop wirelessly. This is by far the best gadget I have bought in the past year.

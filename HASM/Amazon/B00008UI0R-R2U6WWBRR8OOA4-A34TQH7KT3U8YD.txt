Title: Sux in the good way
Content:
I wanted a canister vacuum and chose this one for the reviews and price. It's a bit larger and clunkier than I had visualized, but it has a good vacuum power. The big carpet head only has one level and the headlight shines up in the trees instead of the carpet, but we have mostly hardwood floors and a pug that sheds a ton. It works very well for dog hair on the floors and furniture, but I would really rather have a housekeeper do this stuff. I'm lazy.

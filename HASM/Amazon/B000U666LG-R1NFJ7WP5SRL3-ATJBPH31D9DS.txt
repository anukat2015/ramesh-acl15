Title: Needs fan only feature
Content:
This heater lacks a fan only feature.  I don't understand why they would leave such a simple feature out.  I'd want to use this as just a fan in the summer, but with this unit, the heating element is always on.  You can set the temperature, but in 5 degree increments.  Chances are you'll want a setting in between these.

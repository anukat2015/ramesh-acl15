Title: not a good way to get the "hottest item into your life"
Content:
It's too bad nasty people are using 20 gig iPods as bait for their fake "offers".
I found out the hard way that there's a reason why people say "there's no such thing as a free lunch"!
I fell for the get-it-at-no-charge offers that are being spewed all over Amazon.com these days. After signing up, I was blasted with junk faxes, telemarketing calls, and junk emails. All for the "promise" of what turned out to be a refurbished 1st generation iPod.
I did everything they wanted, but still haven't received any iPod, new or used! Anybody in the market for 500 spams and faxes?

Title: No noise, no smell, saves dough, works well.
Content:
We are very satisfied with this heater.  It is silent and safe and doesn't dry out the air like a normal fan driven space heater.  The thermostat works well and allows a broad range of temp adjustment.  The ComfortTemp setting is a bit warmer than we prefer so we just leave it off and use the thermostat to get the right temp.  
Proper placement in front of a north facing window in our boys room has allowed us to turn down the central heater in the house at night and save $ on our winter heating bills.  I am sure this unit has paid for itself already this winter.
Some new info, I took some power measurements this winter:
Min Power ON only = ~700 Watts
Med Power ON only = ~750 Watts
Med & Min Power switch ON = ~1350 Watts
Of course, when the built in thermostat clicks off the internal heating element, the power
drops to 0 W.

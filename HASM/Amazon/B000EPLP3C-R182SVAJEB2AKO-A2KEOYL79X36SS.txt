Title: Don't waste your time!
Content:
Don't waste your time with this product. It isn't that the device is bad, it's actually pretty good, but the software is the worst and keeps getting worse with every new release and update. To show you how bad this software is, Microsoft has an entire web site devoted to trouble shooting problems!!! Instead of developing the web site, maybe they should should've made a better effort on the software. If you don't mind headaches, wasted hours, and never getting the program to work correctly, then by all means buy this. Otherwise I suggest the iPod. The higher price is worth it.

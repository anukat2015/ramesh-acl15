Title: I LOVE IT.
Content:
We had a Rainbow Vacuum before this one and it finally laid to rest after a decade or so.  Electrolux has been a great replacement for the Rainbow and it's amazing to see what it picks up.  We have a German Shepherd Dog and they shed like crazy.  Not to mention we have old carpets, so every time we vacuum, they look brighter for some reason.  The attachments are easy to use and the whole vacuum itself is easy to carry and move around.  I love how the buttons are on the handle for easy on/off, but I feel they're touch sensitive and I end up turning my vacuum off by accident.  Overall, it's great and my allergies have been at bay since this vacuum-it gets EVERYTHING!

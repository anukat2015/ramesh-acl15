Title: Very Easy to Use!
Content:
I have been researching this camera for a few months now.  I finally, decided to spend the money and purchase the Canon Rebel.  I wanted a camera that takes great pictures of my children.  This camera is worth every penny.  It takes perfect, clear pictures.  I was afraid that I wouldn't know how to use all that it offers or be able to figure out all the buttoms.  All I had to do is read a little and I was ready to take pictures.  I love how I can attach a tripod to the camera, set it on the timer and take a picture of the four of us.  We have never been able to take pictures with both my husband and I in the picture.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.  You will not be disappointed!

Title: Simply Great
Content:
I love this; it works better than so many vacuums I have owned (and I have owned a lot!). However, since I have four cats, I did purchase (not through Amazon) the 'Pet Paw' attachment for pet hair on chairs, etc. This was essential....and it works great. But it wouldn't if the machine itself wasn't fabulous. Easy, functional, simple...I love it!

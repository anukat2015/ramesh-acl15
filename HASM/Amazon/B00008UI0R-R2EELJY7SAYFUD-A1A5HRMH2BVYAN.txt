Title: Great for the price
Content:
I continue to be very impressed with this vacuum.  I have always used Electrolux products in the past.  This machine is every bit as good, and you don't need expensive bags!  The cord and hose are plenty long enough.  It stores easily, is comfortable to use, and does a very good job (it actually picks up my room size oriental rug). You can even wash the filter and dirt receptacle. I have 2 dogs & 3 cats...I vacuum a lot!  I can't say enough good about it, I am very pleased and would recommend this vacuum to friends.

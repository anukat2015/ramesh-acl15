Title: Happy with it.
Content:
I've had this coffee maker over 2 years now and it works great. Love the convenience of pouring one cup and not dealing with a carafe. And the coffee tastes, well....like coffee. Some people are going to give negative reviews based on the fact that the thing might have broke or didn't work as long as they thought it should have. It's a machine. They tend to break sometimes before they should.  No machine is indestructible. That's why there's a warranty. 9 times out of 10 you're going to get a machine, whether it's a car or a coffee maker, that will work as long as it is expected to. My only negative comment would be that it is pricey. But for me personally, I've gotten my money's worth out of it.

Title: Delonghi oil electric heater
Content:
This particular unit I purchased for an area of my dog room. It keeps the room warm with it on higher than the others. That is probably because there is also an exhaust fan in the room going on at intervals. I do have to use a bit of propane if it drops below 0 out but that is ok. The electric bill with these units, which I bought 3 more is over $200 less a month than my propane bill is. The propane went up to around 553. a fill up and the electric is around 317. for the month. By the way the propane will probably be for a month of heating. So I did save some money. Plus we are a lot warmer than we were with the propane, the heat stays more in the lower area of the room and does not go up to the ceiling right away were  we freeze right away. I do have seperate propane heaters in the rooms but the drafts are always taking the best of us. I have a house that is underground and no one had put insulation in the walls at all. I know underground is maybe a bit warmer but in this case it is still drafty with the rest of the house that is showing above ground. So I do think this is the better way to go financially and for keeping warmer.

Title: good for hardwood flors
Content:
This is very good vacuum for small apartments with hardwood floors like my. Does not clean my rugs well (not so powerful engine), but for me is easy to use  specially under sofas. Attachments does not stay in this some place and very often I have to put my vacuum togheter during clining (disconnection pipes - between metal part and plastic). That is most wick part. After all I like it and I using it.

Title: Very good value oriented laptop PC
Content:
Backlit keyboard is the best feature and makes using this laptop far more versatile. Unfortunately, the keyboard itself is not as effective for everyday use. The center area of the keyboard is not as well supported so you have to punch the keys a lot harder to get them to register on the display.  A large HDD (320GB) and 4gigs of user memory, along with Intel Centrino 2.0GHz CPU, make this 64bit Vista PC performance's better than most laptops in the under $600 price range. The WEI is only 3.7 because the integrated graphics support, although "accelerated", is not as good as most full size Desktops with dedicated plug-in video card. The 16" LCD is a true 16x9 widescreen display and looks absolutely stunning.  Also built-in to this laptop is 1.3MP webcam, microphone and two speakers. HDMI output connector is a nice bonus. Only thing missing is Bluetooth support and a BluRay DVD player, but at a significantly higher cost. Internet WiFi access is very fast and makes for a seemingly much more reliable connection than my even my two year old high end desktop PC.  All in all a very good value and one of the few Notebook PC available at any price with a backlit keyboard.

Title: Rebel XT for beginners and for pro's
Content:
I had a Canon film camera (elan 7e) for a while and i decided its time for a digital.  I held off for as long as I could. This meant not getting the original Rebel. Which of course turned out for the better.
The Rebel XT is a nice step up from the original Rebel. With its 0.2 second start up time its alot faster than the original rebel which had around a much longer time of roughly 2-3 seconds. It also has a larger buffer and increased framerate.  The original rebel would take a few shots of RAW at 1.5 Frames per second where the rebel XT takes 3 FPS for 6-7 RAW files and of course even more when shooting JPEG.
There are alot of features on this camera which are nice to have even if you don't need them.
It's a great camera all around.
The smaller size is nice too.
There are alot of people who say its way to small..
I'm 6'4" and my hands aren't small either. It fits nicely.
And with the grip no one can complain.
I would recommend getting a wireless remote for the camera also.

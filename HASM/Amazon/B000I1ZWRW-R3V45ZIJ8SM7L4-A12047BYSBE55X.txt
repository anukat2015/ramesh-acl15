Title: Great camera
Content:
One of the smaller SLR's, this camera is great. This is my first SLR. It has about every feature you could want, and although I ended up changing the lens to a different one than the kit lens, the kit lens is actually great in itself. Even though I prefer to carry point-and-shoot cameras, this camera takes such great pictures, I don't mind lugging around an SLR, which actually says a lot.

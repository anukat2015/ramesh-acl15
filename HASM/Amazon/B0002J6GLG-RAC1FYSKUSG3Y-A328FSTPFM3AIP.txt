Title: Very Great Product
Content:
I've had this for a couple of months, and must say I enjoy it very much. It is ideal for someone who likes multimedia on the go. If you travel a lot, or just are on the go, and have limited access to entertainment, this is definetley the gadget for you. Battery Life is great. Usually lasts me atleast 18 hours of play, mixed in with a 6 or so hours of video, and the rest audio. Not a good pick for someone with over 5,000 songs (unless you want to dedicate the whole HD to just music), or someone with over 10 GB of Video (again, unless you want to dedicate the whole HD to just video). Someone with a couple of thousand songs and 15 movies or so would really appreciate this machine. It does however come with a audio/video compressor which helps a LOT. So even if you have over 20 GB of content, you can fit it on the HD. It does not come with a built-in FM Transmittor/Radio, but that is a small kink, as no present-day gadgets such as this provide that (to my knowledge). It has clear crisp sounds and video, very easy on the eyes with the great bright screen. Has an A/V Output Jack, so if you have a TV in your car, or want to hook it up at a friend's house on their TV, you can do so. Overall it is a very nice product, I would recommend it to everyone. Definetley beats an iPod, unless you are looking for tinyness.

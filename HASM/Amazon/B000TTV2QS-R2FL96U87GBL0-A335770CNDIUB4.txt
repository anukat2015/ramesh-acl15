Title: works good when it wants to
Content:
I bought this heater because I wanted to be able to control the temp in the room with the "programmable thermostat". It does not accurately control temp, reads way higher than the actual temp in the room. It seems like it takes the temp off the heater itself instead of the ambient air temp of the room. works ok in on/off mode but the automatic thermostat mode is basically useless if you want accurate temps. Seems like they would test if it actually works before they sell it.

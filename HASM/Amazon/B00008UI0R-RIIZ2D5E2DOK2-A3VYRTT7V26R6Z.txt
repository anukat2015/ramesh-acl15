Title: Big Disappointment
Content:
After reading about all Hoover vacuums, I decided that this one was the one I needed.  One thing that was missing from the descriptions was the fact that the nozzel/brush does not swivel and I only realized that when I tried to use it.  I thought that I must have put it together wrong (these days everything that you buy has to be assembled), so I called the company and found that it was not made to swivel. It had great suction, but would not turn corners or go in and around furniture.  I had to pick it up in order to turn it and it is very heavy and the nozzel/buush is much too wide to go under most furniture.  Sorry, but I had to return it.

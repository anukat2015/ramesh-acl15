Title: Died gradually
Content:
I bought one last April based on the positive reviews. This heater had good safety features; it shuts off when tipped over and its grille turns orange when it is hot. The thermostat did not seem accurate when used in a small room. It could not always sustain 70 degrees when set to 70, and would not stop heating if set to 75. The "one-push" feature is somewhat annoying, because you have to cycle through up to 12 settings if you accidentally skip one.
After a short while of light use the heater began to rattle loudly from fan vibrations or maybe fan grinding, which was loud enough to disturb sleep. Finally after 9 months, it died. Every time it is turned on, it will last one to five minutes before making a "pop" sound and turning off. It does not turn back on unless you wait a long time. It is a lemon after less than a year, so I feel a one-star rating is appropriate.

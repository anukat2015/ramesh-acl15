Title: Too complex, not hot enough, hard to clean
Content:
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother and returned it within a few days.  The coffee brews at a temperature that is too low for good flavor and the burner does not keep the pot hot enough for later drinking.  The workings of the unit are too complex and it is difficult to clean.  I would not recommend this product.

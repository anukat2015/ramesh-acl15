Title: Broke after 6 hours
Content:
It would have been nice to be able to write a full review on the merits of this laptop, but mine only lasted 6 hours. I received the package, opened it up, powered things on and went through setup. Put it aside and the next time I went to use it it wouldn't power on. Acer told me to send it back as it was a problem that they would need to fix. I'm kind of hesitant to have it replaced, but I picked it up at a great price on black friday.

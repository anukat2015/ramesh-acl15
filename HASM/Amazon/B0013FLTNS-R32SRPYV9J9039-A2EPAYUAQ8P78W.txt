Title: Much improved over original Intel MBP 15"
Content:
I bought an original MBP right out of the gate when they originally came out, and this is, by and large, a huge improvement.  I think the responsiveness of the system, the stability, and the operation of the keyboard have all been improved.  I would recommend this notebook to anyone who is looking for a well-made, well-designed notebook computer.  
For all those who are on the fence about Macs, I would say that using one for a week or two will definitely answer your questions one way or the other - if you have the chance to borrow one for a couple of days, it will definitely give you a feel for your needs and whether a Mac will fulfill them.

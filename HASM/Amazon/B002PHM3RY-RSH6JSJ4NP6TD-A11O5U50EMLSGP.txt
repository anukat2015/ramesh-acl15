Title: Great secondary portable laptop
Content:
totally agree with Dave's previous review,
I was originally looking for a netbook as a secondary laptop and wasn't too concerned with possible limitations of it. But when researching what to get, I discovered this and was really impressed with what it offered at a reasonable price. 
Thus far it has exceeded my expectations. I wouldn't make it my primary work computer (even though its actually more powerful), but it makes a great companion notebook. I can take it anywhere with the 8hr battery life and it isn't so small that I strain my hands typing or my eyes reading long documents. 
Windows 7 has also impressed me. Previously I managed to completely avoid using vista. Now coming from XP I'm finding Windows 7 easy to use, really I hardly notice it is even there.
I would recommend getting this as a secondary portable laptop, or travel laptop. It's worth the extra money over some other cheaper netbooks, but its still  much more reasonably priced then high end 'ultraportable' laptops. 
Note: while the keyboard is basically full size, the small touch pad will take some getting used too, though this is true of any netbook 
One trivial complaint would be the glossy exterior finish - it looks great for about two seconds after you unwrap it, but its easy to scratch and fingerprints are difficult to remove...

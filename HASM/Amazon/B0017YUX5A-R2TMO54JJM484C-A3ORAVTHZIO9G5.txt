Title: Good at removing pet hair
Content:
This was my first new vacuum in 20 years and technology has come a long way.  We have 4 cats and 2 dogs, so we have pet hair on everything!  The powerhead works well at removing pet hair on carpet.  The upholstery attachment works very well removing fine cat hair from furniture.  I vacuum our hardwood floors and the floor attachment has to be held at a certain angle in order to get the full suction to collect all of the pet hair.  This is the only issue I have had and I am still mastering the technique.  The HEPA filter works great and the house no longer smells like a wet dog after I vacuum.  I would recommend this vacuum to other pet owners.

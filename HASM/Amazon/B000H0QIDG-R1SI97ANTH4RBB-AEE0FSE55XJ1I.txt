I purchased this item for my niece who is 9 years old and she loves it.  When it first arrived, I thought it was very small and could be easily lost.  But if your buying this for a responsible little one, no need to worry about that. If they like it enough, they will keep up with it.  I would recommend this item to anyone who loves music.  It has its advantages on being small.  It can be easily stored anywhere, especially for travel.

Title: Great Machine
Content:
I'm not very computer savy.  I own a Sony Vaio Desktop that has lasted me over 5 years, with only the power supply giving out.  I figured it was time to buy a lap top and since Sony has yet to fail me, why not stick with Vaio.  What drew me to this lap top in particular was the graphics card and blu ray player.  Everything runs smoothly and the machine is wonderful.  There are some minor issues with Windows Vista but if you buy a Vaio this year, you get a free upgrade to Windows 7, so it makes everything ok.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a fine machine under 1k.

Title: Great laptop for the price, but you can find it cheaper at retail stores

Since my previous laptop is now technically in two pieces due to the plastic bezel of the monitor breaking, I wanted a laptop that could withstand wear and tear of daily use without compromising on flexibility.  After looking at the other brands around the same price point, I felt the VAIO NW was superior in terms of the design and durability.  Having used it for a few days now, I am very happy with this product and I would recommend it to others.

Title: Uninstallable
Content:
The instruction booklet is so poorly produced that the instructions can't be read without a lot of eye strain. Even with magnification they are barely intelligible. Maybe they ran out of ink when they were printed the booklet I received.  This is the first thing a new customer needs to see and they can't print a decent copy for us? Then the update software message notifies me that there is an update to the their studio but when I ask to download the updates it fails. Repeatedly. I've owned a Sansa before (stolen) and I wish I would have gone back to that brand. I had that up and running in minutes.

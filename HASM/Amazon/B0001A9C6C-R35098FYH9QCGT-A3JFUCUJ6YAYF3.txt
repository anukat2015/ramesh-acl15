Title: You wont regret this purchase!
Content:
My mini (silver) got delivered yesterday and i LOVE it. I have a full sized ipod and had fears about spending $250 + tax on a mini when an extra $50 would have enabled me to purchase the 20gb ipod....but after recieving the mini and using it all day today i have to say that i love it more then my ipod. The size more then makes up for its lack in capacity.

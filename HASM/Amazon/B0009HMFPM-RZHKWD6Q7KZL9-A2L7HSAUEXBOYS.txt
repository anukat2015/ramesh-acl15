Title: Frozy legs -- it's for the birds
Content:
Cozy Legs is a tidy, lightweight panel that produced no perceptible heat at a distance of 12-inches. It was placed under a built-in desk that is completely enclosed on five sides (left, right, back, top, and floor). This was the ideal situation for the panel to show its effectiveness. It is simply too underpowered. 
Some raters liked the panel as a heater for their pet birds. It may be suitable for that, if you can get it right up against the cage and the ambient room temperature is within a couple of degrees of what's ideal for the birds.
Lastly, for some odd reason, Amazon shipped this item in a box that was large enough to hold two dozen panels. Was this to discourage sending the wimpy warmer back? This was an expensive learning experience.

Title: Good if you don't mind these annoyances
Content:
The fireplace works fine in it's most important aspect: generating heat. It has a stylish, very contemporary design. The glass front is thick and smooth and you don't need to worry about cracking it. The blue backlit display turns off after a few seconds which is nice. Great remote that supports all functions. There are a few annoyances that were weighing too heavily for us and made me return it, though: First, since the unit is only a few inches deep and it is either wall-mounted or on the stand there is no easy way to hide the cord, which really spoils the appearance. The fan is a little noisy and keeps on running even when the heat is turned off, probably to cool the two lamps and to generate the light effect. The "crackling wood" sound effect sounds hollow and thin but can thankfully be turned off. Finally, the light effect is not realistic at all, just a waving background.
If you don't mind these annoyances, it is a good product.

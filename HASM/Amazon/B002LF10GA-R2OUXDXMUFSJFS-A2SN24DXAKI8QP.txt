Title: Works great, but why do they load so much useless software
Content:
My Acer Aspire arrived two days early and well packaged.  Two thumbs up for Amazon.  The computer battery was charged and ready to go out of the box.  Everything worked out great, but why do these companies insist on installing a bunch of useless software on these computers.  I spent some time deleting all the evaluation software and other useless items.  This computer is being used on a home wireless network, and had no problems finding and working on the network.
The screen is clear, and 11.6 inches is a great size for portability and still being large enough for easy web browsing.  The speakers are pretty useless, but you can't really expect them to be that great.  
Overall I gave this a four star rating because of the useless extra software that comes preloaded.

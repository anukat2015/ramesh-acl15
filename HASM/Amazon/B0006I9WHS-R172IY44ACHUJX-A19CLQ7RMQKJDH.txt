Title: Keeps my office warm and comfy
Content:
I purchased this heater to add a little heat to my office, which luckily for me has a window, but unluckily for me, also has a draft. I've been very happy with the results! The built-in thermostat keeps the office at a steady temperature, which is perfect. It doesn't take up much space, which is also a bonus. Downsides: There is no off-switch, so I have to unplug it at the end of the day. That's not so great, because occasionally I forget if the blower is not actively running when I'm getting ready to leave. The noise level from the machine is reasonable, though certainly not silent. In summary, this model perfectly meets my needs. For the price and convenience, it is worth tolerating the minor downsides. And it was affordable. I'd definitely purchase this model again. 
Update 11/26/06: I said I'd purchase this again, and now that I have a new drafty bedroom, I have just ordered this product again. I anxiously await its arrival this week.

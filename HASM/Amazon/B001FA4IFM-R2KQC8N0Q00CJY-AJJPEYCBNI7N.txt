Title: Very quiet heater
Content:
We've had the heater a few days now and are impressed as to how quiet it is.  We've had ceramic heaters from other manufactures and none come close to being this quiet.  For the size of the heater it does just fine as far as heat output.  Another plus is NO ANNOYING BEEPS every time you turn it on or off or adjust the temperature setting.  Nice warranty-five years.  We would definitely purchase another.

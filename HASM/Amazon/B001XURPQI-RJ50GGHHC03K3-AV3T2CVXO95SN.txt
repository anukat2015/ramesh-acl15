Title: Great Camera over all
Content:
I am very happy with this camera. The last time I owned a "real" camera was also a Rebel, but the 35mm version. Now I am amaze of the great features and the possibility to see what you shot right away. I am specially enjoying the connection to my HDTV at home. I can see the videos as well as the pictures via the mini HDMI connector. The possibility to change ISO on the fly makes low light conditions not an issue. The battery life is also very good. I am able to go for long walks and keep the camera on and ready all the time. Usually I turn de display off and just focus through the lenses. I probably should get the extension for the viewfinder, I hate to get my nose mark on the display glass. I am loving to use it with my new Macbook Pro, when shooting at the studio, I can control the camera with the laptop and see the image I am capturing in a big screen. Over all I love the camera I am happy I make a right choice, it is so light weight, that I can carry it all the time with no problem.

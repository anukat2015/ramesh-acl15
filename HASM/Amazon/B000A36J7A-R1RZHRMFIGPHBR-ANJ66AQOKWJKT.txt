Title: I agree with  J. Leary "jleary" -- Great computer, horrible company
Content:
I've owned a Gateway M305CRV for over 3 years with absolutely no issues.  And I bought this thing used as a refurbished unit from Gateway via a third-party reseller online.  It only came with a 90 day warranty from Gateway, but I was able to contact Gateway and get the warranty extended to a full 3 year deal (I had to pay for the extension of course).  But it turned out I didn't need the warranty at all, it expired in March without me using it.
When I first bought this laptop I worked for a University in North Carolina that was a authorized Gateway service center (which is why I bought a Gateway).  Of course since I got the laptop, Gateway has gone from being shaky to downright awful.  Selling a large part of their core systems to MPC and outsourcing virtually everything.

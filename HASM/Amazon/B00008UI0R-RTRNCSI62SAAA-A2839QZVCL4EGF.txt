Title: COOL MACHINE
Content:
I almost bought a central vacuum, but instead I bought this little machine (...) and I'm glad I did.  It is a very good vacuum!!! I'm so impressed with the quality of the vacuum and the price.  There are no bags either!!  I can see thru the container and empty it out whenever it is full.  Does great job on carpet, but I used it on hardwood floor as well.  The suction power is great, and adjustable.  This is really good engineering @ work.  The whirl inside of it looks like a tornado, which picks up the dust and pushes it down, it's even fun to watch.  BTW, I'm in NY and  digitalfotoclub charged me tax and shipping.  For the shipping I chose the cheapest, which was 7-9 days, but I got it in 2 days!!  Can't beat that, but I almost got suckered in for the 2nd day shipping which would have been a waste of money!!.

Title: Worst vacuum I have ever used
Content:
This vacuum is a huge waste of money.  It's practically useless.  My first complaint is that it shoots dust everywhere and does not work on bare floors, as it claims to.  The Power Paw cleaning tool was a big reason for my purchase of this vacuum, as I have cats and wanted to use it to clean my furniture.  It worked for about 25 uses then got stuck on the vacuum and did not work when I finally managed to pull it off.  Every time I use this vaccuum it shoots dust and the vacuum itself ends up covered in dust, which tells me the expensive Hepa filter is not working AT ALL.  The vacuum is very heavy and the parts are not user-friendly.  For example, I am currently searhing online for insructions on how to put the cover to the filter back on...once you take it off, it seems nearly impossible.  The tube that connects to the attachments is very short and inflexible, making it difficult to vacuum anything but carpet floors.  Even on carpet it shoots dust and small pieces out unless it's at exactly the right angle.  It's very heavy to push. Terrible, terrible vacuum.  I am ready to throw it in the dumpster.

Title: Does what it's supposed to
Content:
We had one of these in the last office I worked in, which was a converted older house.  It worked fantastically well, it was quiet, and really cooled down all four rooms from the central area between them.
My only complaint is that, unless things have changed since we got ours, the instructions were minimal and almost incomprehensible.  It was a Chinese translation, if I remember right, and I ended up having to go on their web site to puzzle out how half the controls even worked.
That aside, highly recommended as an alternative to a window-mounted A/C, especially if you ever need to move it to other areas - an almost impossible task with window-mounted units.

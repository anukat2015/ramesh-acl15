Title: Great compact interchangeable lens camera
Content:
This camera has been great thus far. I have a Nikon D200 and D300. Three Elph Powershots, an Olympus 1050 and others. The fact that this camera is so compact and so sharp with excellent versatility and features makes it a unique and balanced addition to the others. It is so tight and compact and it has done an excellent job under a variety of conditions.
The camera records very detailed images and is able to maintain that detail at lower shutter speeds in despite of the O.I.S. The white balance appears excellent on the LCD but has not been great under certain conditions which have been easily corrected.
Focus is quick, battery life is good, color rendition is quite good and there is not much more to ask for when looking to complement a pro SLR. This camera can go where you want without the liability or the excess weight and it takes superb images. The tests will prove it.
Printed images should be good. It has been skiing in the Alps and the images have needed almost nothing. White balance is good when you don't have to think to hard about it or when a camera is consistent. The color rendition of skin tones under a variety of conditions is excellent and that includes the flash. The contrast detect AF is great but has not been tested with bursts or ultra low light. Nonetheless, this camera is a winner in my book and will most likely become a cult camera if it does not get adopted widely. It has worked very, very well thus far.

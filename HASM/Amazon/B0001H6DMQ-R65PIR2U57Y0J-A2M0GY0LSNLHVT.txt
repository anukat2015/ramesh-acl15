Title: a disappointing product from Hoover praised by consumer reportss
Content:
The belt that drives the vacuum falls off regularly and the bagless tank has minuscule capacity.  it is no better than a toy. Searching the internet for cannister vacuums this product was highly praised by Consumer Reviews which lead me to purchase it through Amazon.com.

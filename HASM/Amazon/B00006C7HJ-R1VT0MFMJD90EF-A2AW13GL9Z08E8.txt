Title: "OVER" HEATER
Content:
The VH2 I purchased almost burned down my house. The fan quit working but the heating element did not. After smelling something burning, I found the smoking heater, the heating element was red hot. The saftey devices failed to shut it down. Warrenty does not cover shipping, which is about $40.00. For that much money, I will buy a name brand heater that I can trust and who's maker stands behing the product. Vornado does not.

Title: good heater, poor service
Content:
Heater is excellent, at a good price; was received quickly. However, as the package was lacking warranty information AND even some basic instructions on its use, I contacted the vendor at the e-mail shown on their invoice, asking them to contact me about these issues.  I NEVER RECEIVED ANY REPLY, OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF MY COMPLAINT.
However, the product was quite satisfactory. SInce I had originally planned to order TWO (the first vendor showed only 1 in stock), I subsequently ordered a second identical heater from a different Amazon vendor--- AND this one came with the instructions.

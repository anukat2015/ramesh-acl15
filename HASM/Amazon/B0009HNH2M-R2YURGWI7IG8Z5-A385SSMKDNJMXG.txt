Title: Not designed to clean anything
Content:
Just opened the box and vacuumed my living room (carpet) and front entry, kitchen and bathroom (hard flooring). Here are my comments: 
On carpet, I needed to pass over debris several times in order to pick up. The vacuum doesn't pick up any debris 1 1/2 inches away from the wall. The vacuumed seemed light enough, however it was extremely tiring to push across the carpet
On hard flooring, the larger debris seemed to scatter about. The vacuum still didn't pick up any debris 1 1/2 inches away from the wall. It didn't move around obsticles easily and it couldn't fit between my bathroom cupboards and the toilet.
When using the attachments, I couldn't vacuum along side my refrigerator with the crevice tool because the tool holder was in the way. The extension wand too heavy to vacuum cobwebs or anything that would require a reach.
During my cleaning I also had the following things happen. The attachments fell off of the tool holder several times. And, I had to keep turning the vacuum back on because the hose would rotate around and push the off button for me.
Overall, I would have to say that this vacuum was obviously not designed by anyone who has ever cleaned a house before. I am sad to say this because I was hoping that this would be a great multi-purpose vacuum just like my old Hoover Canister Windtunnel used to be.

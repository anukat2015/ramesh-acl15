Title: The Answer to My Coffee Prayers?
Content:
I bought this machine last night and I have to say I am SUPER impressed. I chose the B60 Special Edition over the other models because of the added features. ie: travel mug size, the brew temperature adjust, the timer AND the ability to purchase a filter for it so you can brew YOUR OWN FRESH GROUND COFFEE!!!
That's the best feature of the Keurigs, they made it easy to use your own coffee, cutting down on the cost of having to buy K-cups!!!

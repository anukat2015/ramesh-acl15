Title: Hoover Vacuum
Content:
I was quite pleased with my purchase. It really picks up the dirt and much easier to vacuum the stairs. I also like the attachments, especially the upholstery one. Like others, the only thing that would be better is a longer extension cord, but I guess the price you pay for automatic windup, however, be careful with the pedal to zip it back in. It can hurt your ankle.
Overall, a good purchase for the price. Packs up conveniently, lightweight, works great, less of a "workout" to vacuum, and easy on the back!

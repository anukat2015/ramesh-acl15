Title: Cool.........
Content:
Pretty cool camera but I sold mine to my sister BRAND NEW for $50.00 cause it just wasnt what I was looking for I guess, It was too big to carry with you all the time & if you buy this you have to be prepared to ALSO spend at least $1,000.00 on all the extras that you need just to have it the way its meant to be (new lenses, flash, ect...ect...ect...) The lens that comes with it is OK but it doesnt zoom & you cant take up-close photos, the camera will NOT let you, it just turns black, so be prepared to spend spend spend!! Overall the camera itself was good quality though!! There is NO image stabilization & you cant view you photos on the LCD while you are shooting (you have to hold the camera up to your eye) Just read reviews & check many sites first to make sure it IS what you want!

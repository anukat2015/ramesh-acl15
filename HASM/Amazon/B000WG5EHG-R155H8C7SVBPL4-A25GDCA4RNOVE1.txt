Title: Absolutely worthless product
Content:
This is by far the most worthless product I have purchased.  Microsoft really should have gotten their act together before they marketed this product.  I am a very computer-savvy person but it took me almost 3 hours !!! to install the Zune software - every install would result in different errors and necessitate extensive Windows updates!!   What MP3 product software requires such an extensive software update to be able to use something as basic as an MP3 player.  Even after all this effort, the power-on button would respond very inconsistently and the MP3 player would randomly lock at the Zune logo.   The button design of this MP3 is beyond pathetic.  Try calling Microsoft Zune support - you get a 14-year-old kid in a 3rd-world country with a squeaky voice who has no logical skills to troubleshoot any problem but simply reiterates a pre-programmed script that Microsoft has told him to say for each catch phrase the consumer says.   If Microsoft thinks they have anything even remotely close to a viable and simple-to-use MP3 player, they really need get their head out of their A* and relook at the other MP3 players on the market.  IF anyone is considering this product, I would advise you look at other MP3 players which offer a simple yet elegant design and don't require almost a complete reinstall of your windows operating system.

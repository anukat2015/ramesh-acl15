Title: Compaq - great screen, great price, very wrong on battery life.
Content:
I bought this machine recently with a few goals in mind. Primarily I would use it at the house, but maybe every few months I fly somewhere and thought I could use it to play movies on the flight.  The materials say 4.5 hour battery life.  I brought it home, charged it overnight, then cleaned off all the useless programs, turned off anything I didn't need, like wireless, copied a movie I recorded off TV onto the harddrive, and turned the screen brightness way down. I barely got to 2 hours.  I recharged it over night, and got the same result.  I tried it one more time, and even with the sound off, I couldn't get past 2 hours.  On the plus side, while plugged in the screen resolution is great, the touch pad has a very elegant touch ( much better than the HP dm3-1130us I ended up with) and while it is heavy, it isn't much heavier than the competition.  I didn't test it much in the way of speed, though I thought most of the keys worked well and had a nice feel.  If they didn't exaggerate the battery life so much, I would not have bought it.  If it came with an 8 or 12 cell battery, I might have kept it.  I instead went with a smaller screen and no optical drive, hope the battery on that one lasts longer.

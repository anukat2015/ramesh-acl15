Title: poor quality
Content:
I had to have this unit replaced three times as they were sent to me with cracks in the front case (poor quality manufacturing). When I finally recieved a unit that wasn't cracked it performed quite poorly. It wasn't able to cool even a tiny room the least bit. The previous other two units I had ordered were very noisy on top of this with sounds of water dripping (very annoying). The unit has a nice design to it but the reality is that it will just blow hot air around and won't make the least bit of difference. Don't waste your money you will regret it I'm sorry to say!

Title: Sink the Pink???
Content:
First off, let me say that we bought this as a replacement for our Braun-KF600, which is no longer made. If you've read our review, on the Braun, it was respectably buried, and not shot! :)
     We've had this coffee maker for a little over a month now. As such, I don't know about performance longevity. So, as an 'enhanced' first impression, since Amazon sent a Review Request:
1- there really should be more room to pour the water! It's tricky enough on any morning, but if you've had a Saturday Bender, than trying to pour water into this thing on a Sunday morning, is akin to sharp shooting skills!
2- The water markers on the fill window are in silver. This is fine when the kitchen has lots of light, but don't show up well otherwise. A Sharpie marker easily corrects this.
Aside form those qualms, the pink caffeine server does what it's supposed to do; make a decent cup of coffee! We are also thinking of buying the thermal carafe. (Our Braun spoiled us)
     If this coffee maker last even through the 3 year warrantee period, it will have lasted longer than any other coffee maker we've owned. If it goes beyond that- Cuisinart will have found at least 2 customer's for life!

Title: Quick and portable
Content:
Quick little machine. Graphic speed is lacking, but that's the tradeoff for the size. My only complaint is the touchpad. It varies between unresponsive and squirly with a mind all it's own. The drivers are all up to date, so you'll just have to get used to it. Still, a nice laptop.

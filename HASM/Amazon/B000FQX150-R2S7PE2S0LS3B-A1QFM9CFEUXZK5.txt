Title: Excellent little coffee maker
Content:
I love coffee. And, I'm kind of an elitist when it comes to coffee. I can only use really good beans-- right now I'm using Lavazza, but my every day coffee is starbucks brand.  The problem is, I cannot produce a good POT of coffee for the life of me. I don't know why. I use filtered water. I clean out the carafe. My regular every day machine has a water filter. I don't know why my pots of coffee are horrid compared to my husband's pots of coffee, which taste as if they came from the local coffeehouse/espresso bar.
So, after getting a free senseo (YUCK!), and giving it to a friend, I bought this little coffee maker.  IT makes a really good cup of coffee I have not messed up even one time.  And, I use it 5-10 times per day.  It is just excellent.  I've been looking at the higher priced one cup makers, such as the Tassimo, but I'm not sure I need it. With freshly ground good beans, this little coffee maker does the job.
This coffee maker, by the way, makes a hot cup of coffee-- definitely as hot as every full-size coffeemaker I've ever had. I'm wondering if the other reviewer just got a machine that didn't work too well.  Or, maybe he just likes it from boiled water.  Whatever the case, if you're used to drinking coffee made from regular drip machines, this one is fine.
I've had this coffeemaker for at least two months now, and I literally use it 5 to 10 times per day.  I keep expecting it to break, because it's definitely not made expensively, but it keeps going.  I think it's a great choice for someone like me or someone in an office.
This comes with a durable reusable gold-colored metal filter.

Title: This is the perfect one cup brewer.
Content:
Okay, I've spent hundreds of dollars on different coffee makers over the past two years... I've tried pod brewers (too strong), Mr. Coffee's (horrible taste), old fashioned percolaters and more.  I wanted something fast, easy to use with a big enough cup for my morning coffee.  This fits the bill perfectly.  It comes with a 15 ounce travel mug with a tight lid that doesn't allow leaking when I'm at the computer.  It's very easy to clean and after a few weeks of use I don't get any "silt" at the bottom of the cup as another reviewer complained.  The permanent filter works for me and this brews a great cup of coffee from all types of grounds.

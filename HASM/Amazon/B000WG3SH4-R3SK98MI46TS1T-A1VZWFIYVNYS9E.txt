Title: Lasted 4 months
Content:
I loved my Zune until it just froze and died yesterday. I thought maybe it needed to re-charge again, but nothing I did worked. It just died.  Paid over $100 for it, very upset.  Should last a lot longer than 4 months.  Now have to purchase another one and it sure won't be a Zune.

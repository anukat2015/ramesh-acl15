Title: Excellent addition to my office...
Content:
I'm extremely pleased with this little heater.  I've had two other brand heaters to die on me in the last year but this is an excellent replacement.  My office is frosty yearlong so this heater is great because I'm able to run it at any temperature without any problems; the metal surface area does it hot so it's safe...it automatically cuts off if you tip it over and doesn't "overheat" or short circuit after running it for an extended period of time.  I would definitely recommend.

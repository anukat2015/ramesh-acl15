Title: Love it love the color
Content:
I have an orange 16gig nano.  I use it in the car with an FM transmitter and while working out.  It works great.  I am not a huge fan of the shake to shuffle because if it falls off my lap in the car it shuffles but you can turn that off so it isn't a big deal.  The battery doesn't last as long as my second generation shuffle but that is to be expected as the shuffle doesn't have a screen.  Overall I would recommend this Ipod.

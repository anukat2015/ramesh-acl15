Title: Great Coffee, Hot, Choices Galore, and a Reliable Machine!
Content:
My wife and I have drastically differing tastes in coffee... We each brew our own particular choice every morning. Until the purchase of our new Breville Gormet Single Serving Coffee Maker we have been wasting a LOT of coffee!
Having studied the reviews and historys of several offerings of this particular style of coffee maker we decided on Breville... We couldn't be happier! While the machine is relatively expensive the end product and quality construction is well worth the extra dollars.
The unit is very stylish, has great portion choices, gives you HOT coffee (190+), and is reasonably quiet. Cleaning is a breeze and it holds a good supply of hot water at the ready. Best of all there is no leaking or dribbling from ANY point on the machine! The automatic On/Off timer assures that there is hot water when we get up and shuts off if we should forget. If you start from "cold" it only takes about 3 minutes to heat the water to full temperature.
While the unit comes with a good variety,there are, of course, a LOT of "K-Kup" coffee suppliers all of which offer "Sample Packs" to try their different blends. Choosing just the "right" coffee is both fun and easy.

Title: K-CUP EXCHANGE
Content:
Hi K-Cup users,
I started a User Group on Yahoo called K-CUP EXCHANGE. it's for exchanging unwanted K-Cups. This is simply a site that allows you to sell/trade/give your unwanted coffee flavors to someone else in the group to try. It's your business how it's done. You can also tell everyone your experiences with different flavors, and what to watch out for.
This Group is the logical way for us to do this, as no one wants to get stuck with 50 cups of a flavor they totally dislike, right? It also gives you the chance to try a flavor you'd never buy from the description.
Anyway, the group is 100% free to join and use, and I'll do my best to monitor it for spam. It's at: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/K-CUP/
Hope to see you there.  Dean

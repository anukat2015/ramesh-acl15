Title: never, never again
Content:
I have purchased three from this company in the past year -- we have twins in college and each needed one -- then one for personal/home use.   
Within a month after each warranty expired, the hard drive died.   Nothing could be done but order a replacement - which first requires a $49 diagnostic fee....before they can even tell you what the part is that is needed and how much that will cost.   
They cannot replace items lost on the drive --- so be sure to have your own external hard drive or system for back up.   They are no help.
This happened three times!!  Three different laptops!!  All with simple use at home and university.   Each just AFTER the warranty expired -- and they are in India -- and make no adjustments to "policy" -- and have the most effective system of blocking customers from access to attaining help.   
Never, ever again.   Burned THREE times -- with THREE different laptops.   Never, never again.

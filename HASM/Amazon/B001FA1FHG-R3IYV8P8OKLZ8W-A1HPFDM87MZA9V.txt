Title: Excellent purchase
Content:
Very nice item.  Easy to install.  You can with mount it to the wall (brackets included) or you can just stand it up.  I have this mounted in a wall in a finished basement, about 1300 square feet, and it heats up the room just fine.  The sound is sort of annoying, so you can just turn it off.  Excellent item for the price.

Title: A big disappointment
Content:
I bought the IPod Touch to substitute my Palm PDA.  I was told it would sync with the calendars and contacts in Outlook 2007.  It wouldn't. I needed to purchase for $99 a year a subscription to Mobile Me.  Then it would sync. Contacts were not sync'd correctly even with Mobile Me.  I called Apple support to try to fix the problem with the direct sync to Outlook. I was told by Apple support that the Touch really does not support Office 2007.  What? Since I purchased the Touch strictly as a PDA, it is useless to me. I'm very disappointed with Apple and their product.  Let's face it, they do not make their products to easily be compatible with a PC.  Bottom line, it's not worth it. Stay with the IPod classic or nano for use as an MP3 player and forget the Touch.

Title: Criminally Stupid Design
Content:
What do you get when you combine a persnickety shutoff valve with electronics below the coffee carafe?  An overflowing basket, an electrical short, and three pounds of plastic and glass for the landfill.
The "sneak-a-cup" feature of this pot is a good idea, but the switch that shuts off the flow is so finicky that the carafe can look and feel centered under the basket, but not allow the coffee to drip through.  This means that when the auto-brew feature goes on before you wake up, the brewing coffee fills up the basket, pours out over the top, and puddles up on the counter.  
Now, this is a mess, and hardly what you want to face before you've had your morning cuppa, but that's not the worst of it.  The soft-touch keypad is centered under the carafe, and it is not sealed around the edge, so the coffee that spills over the basket leaks directly into the electronics.   
In my experience, this has a permanent, negative effect on the function of the coffee maker.  
Don't buy it!

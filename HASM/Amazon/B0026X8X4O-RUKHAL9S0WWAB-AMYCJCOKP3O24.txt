Title: poorly designed
Content:
I recently purchased this coffee maker because of the design, features and espacially the Mr. Coffee name. I'm tremendously dissapointed in it for the following reasons. It's poorly designed. After using it and you lift the lid to remove then basket, the condesation on the inside of the lid drips down the back of the unit and pools on the countertop. It's also impossible to completly empty the pot and there's always some left in the bottom of it. Another problem with it is that you cannot insert your hand into the pot, with a dish cloth, to wash the dried residue out of the pot. I had to use a set of tongs to clean it. Another feature that made me purchase it was the charcoal filter included. This I quickly found was impratical to use. You have to play with the paper filter in order for it to sit correctly on the basket.
If I hadn't discarded the box in came in I would be returning it to get my money back.

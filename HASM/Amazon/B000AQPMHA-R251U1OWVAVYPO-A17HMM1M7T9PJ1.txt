Title: A "Must-Have" for the Holidays or any other Family Gathering
Content:
I own a Keurig B70 and I use it all of the time, however, my oldest daughter is not a coffee drinker and doesn't even own an imitation Mr. Coffee.  When we went to her house in Albuquerque for Thanksgiving I sent a Keuring B40 to her so that it would arrive before we did.  It was the hit of the gathering!  I brought a lot of K-Cups from my collection to add to the sampler that comes with the machine.  We went through over a hundred pods in the two days that the group (about 15 people) was there.  Hot chocolate was a popular beverage for many, as were the assorted coffees and teas (for some reason Hazelnut seems to be the preferred flavored coffee for all of my guests).  I even brought some of the holiday themed coffees which are available from Keurig during this time of the year, like "Gingerbread" made by Green Mountain and "Perfectly Pumpkin" by Timothy's.  A little whipped cream made the coffees perfect.  Everyone got what they wanted and they all just helped themselves (which my daughter loved!).  
The B40 is about half the price of the B70 and although it has less features (it makes two sizes of drinks instead of 4 and the reservoir is not lighted) no one cared, not even me.  I added the carousel to complete the package.  
The family is meeting again right after Christmas, this time in Arizona and I am sure the Keuring will make the trip and be a welcomed addition to the festivities.  This is a great value and perfect for entertaining.

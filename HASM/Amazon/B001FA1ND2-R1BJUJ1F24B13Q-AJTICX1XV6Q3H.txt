Title: Ipod Nano Hard to use
Content:
I found this Ipod Nano to be very hard to use especially without a complete user guide ! The worst thing to me was the fact that to add any MP3 files or any other format of any kind you MUST download Apple's web site. So without that its useless and they do not tell you that up front. In the small quick guide they supply with the Nano it does not tell you at all how you charge the battery which again can only be done thru your PC. The controls are extremely sensitive which makes it very hard to use as you must really pratice a lot to become fimilar with it!. Last I was told it could be used in my new Dodge Car both by Dodge and by Apple and I can't get it to work yet as it keeps going to or showing " no power" mode when I plug into the Console Ipod Connection Port.In using it as a pocket music source it does have great sound however , but also hard or sensitive to use as the slightest pressuer or bump to the Ipod will change the mode or music you are listining to. If I knew all this prior I don't think I would have bought this Apple Ipod Nano at all.

Title: Excellent Computer for beginner or expert
Content:
I bought the Macbook so I can learn OS X and switch from Windows. I absolutely love the OS and the construction of the computer. I bought it upgraded with 4 GB Ram and a 320 GB hard drive. The computer is plenty fast and does what I need it to without any issues. I am stil learning alot about the system but I can say it performs admirably and has had no issues with whatever software I threw at it. The 2.26 GHZ Core 2 duo chip is plenty to do most tasks without a problem. Since I am not into video editing I don't need the muscle of the New Macbook Pro line. The biggest difference I found is OS X 10.6 is very user friendly and extremely powerful. The built in webcam is very handy and great for video chats and taking quick pics for Facebook etc. I also purchased an External 1 TB drive for time machine backups and storage of downloaded programs, data backup, etc. 
I had a G3 Ibook several years ago and hated the original OS X  as it was slow and a royal pain to use. I decided to give the new Mac a chance after watching several tech podcasts about it and seeing its speed and functionality
Can't wait to sell the PC and be MAC Only!!  With a linux netbook on the side :)

Title: Does its job, with only a few minorly annoying quirks
Content:
This product, corresponding with most the reviews I read for the product before purchasing, does a great job at heating small- to medium-sized spaces, and has great safety features that make using a space heater much less worrisome. However, the heater is quite loud and does glow red, which can be annoying if you are planning on using this in a bedroom. The front of the heater also does get quite hot so children and animals should be kept away. I am using this heater to heat the back area of my house, which our central heat does not reach. It is great, and I love the easy-to-use thermostat which turns off the heater once it reaches the specified temperature. I only wish that it had more flexible thermostat settings that the user could adjust. But overall, a great product and definitely worth the price.

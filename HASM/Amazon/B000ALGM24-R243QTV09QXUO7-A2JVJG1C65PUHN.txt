Title: Simple to install, easy to use
Content:
This is my fourth electronic thermostat in 4 years and 2 houses. I had previously purchased a smaller hunter thermostat which melted because of a short circuit in the a/c and its replacement (not a hunter) simply stopped working after less than a year. I was frustrated with my luck and thought it best to go back to  Hunter device.
This model is by far the most comprehensive device I have purchased. The energy star features promise reduced heating and cooling bills and the very thorough manual made installation and programming incredibly simple. The "through the back" wiring feature greatly helped installation in a house where the thremostat wires were cut short.
While I had been very happy with the more simple hunter thermostat that melted, it did not have one of the best functions contained in this newer model--the combined heat and air controls. Living in a state with four seasons makes temperatures during some weeks of the spring and fall difficult to predict and I have woken up on unexpectedly chilly fall and spring mornings without any heat--as the thermostat was still set to the cool function. With the option of controling both heat and air using one setting I'm looking forward to cool nights and toasty mornings!

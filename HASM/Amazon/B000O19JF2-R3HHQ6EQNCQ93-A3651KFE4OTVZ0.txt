Title: Great buy
Content:
I guess you could call this an advanced basic camera.  It look very basic and intuitive from the outside, but on the inside and feature wise its very advanced.  It has ISO settings for almost any lighting environment and it can also take pictures in RAW format.  It's JPEG format takes amazing quality photos though.  One feature about this that I simply love, is that it will take picture in a widescreen format, just like video.  Best of all, its very light and easy to carry around as compared to other camera that have the same features.

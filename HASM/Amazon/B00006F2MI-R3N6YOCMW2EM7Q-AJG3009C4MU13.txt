Title: Works great if you read the instructions!!!!
Content:
I wanted one of these ever since I used my mother's.  When I read the reviews on amazon, I wasn't so sure that I wanted to buy one.  Then I thought about how great the freshly ground coffee was that I had from using this product before and I decided to buy anyway.  If you read the easy-to-understand instructions and notes printed on the product itself, I am fairly confident that you won't have problems.  The instructions warn about spillage if you 1. overfill the reservoir or the grinder and 2. turn the gold filter basket with the handle the wrong way.  I rinse off all the grinder pieces and basket after use and let them air dry.  I have had no problems with this grind and brew.  It truly does make perfect coffee.

Title: Works great
Content:
I am very pleased with the Hoover S3765-040 Wind Tunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum.  I like not having a bag, but it also takes some getting used to emptying the canister so often and cleaning the filter.  We have a lot of animals, so I have to stop and empty and brush off the filter fairly often, but it's performance it great.

Title: Excellent heater
Content:
I really like this heater. Got one for Christmas, to replace my office space heater which had just burnt out;however, my office doesn't open until after New Years Day, so we used it at the house, as the weather turned cold. It worked WONDERFULLY, better than I expected! And the oscillating feature is a MUST - what I used to hate about my old heater was that it always projected heat in the same, small area and I was forever moving it around to avoid getting one spot too hot - this heater doesn't have that problem. It works great!

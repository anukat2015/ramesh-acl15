Title: Best $700 I have ever spent
Content:
This camera is just amazing, it has no equal in it's price range. The clarity of the pictures captured with just a kit lens is astounding. It is certainly the closest to a pro model that most photo enthusiasts will afford. The only complaint I could have is Pentax's decision to hold on to the P-TTL flash system. It limits the selection of external flashes and I am not convinced on it's performance. Other than that I think the many pro features, the amazing construction and the amazing ability to capture strikingly sharp detail makes up for it's P-TTL downfall. I am not easily satisfied with cameras and I love this thing!

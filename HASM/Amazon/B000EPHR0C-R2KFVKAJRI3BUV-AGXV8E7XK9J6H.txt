Title: The Way it Should Be
Content:
I had previously owned a Philips GOGear HDD6330 30GB mp3 player and had many many problems.  Mostly with syncing the songs onto the device and also some with proper playback.  The interface was also not as nice nor responsive as the iPod.  So I returned the Philips and got the 80GB iPod.  It has not let me down once.  It sounds great, the battery lasts for days (4-6 hours a day use).  itunes is very easy to use and seems to almost know what you need to do before you do.  podcasts are neat and free, you can download tons of videos from google video, you can put pictures on it, no problems finding accessories.  It is really just night and day vs. the current windows based offerings.  I have about 6,500 songs, 50 videos, 200 photos, and all of my outlook contacts on my iPod and it is only about half full.  Not to mention the games that come with it.  If you don't mind spending a little more for quality, this is the way to go, it just works.
My wife also has the 30GB white version and loves it.  it does have a lot less space and shorter battery life than the 80 GB, but it is about 1/2 the thickness and still has all of the other features that make iPods so great.  We also both sync using the same itunes without any problems (turn off auto syncing to do this and drag songs etc to device.)  This was not the case when we both were using Philips GoGears and Windows Media Player.  Everyone else that I know that owns an iPod has never said anything bad about them, Apple really has a winner here, it would take a lot of convincing to ever switch me back over to windows based mp3 systems.

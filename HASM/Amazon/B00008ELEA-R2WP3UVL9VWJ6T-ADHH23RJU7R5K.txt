Title: Love my Farberware
Content:
I've owned my Farberware Perc for over 25 years. I have a second one I got an excellent deal on as a back-up. Yes they've both been repaired but they're still going strong. 
For the thermostat problem I'd suggest going to a suggested repair place that is in the folder with the pot and have the repairman show you how simple it is to do your own replacing. Then stock up on the parts needed. There seemed to be a streak/batches of bad thermostats that just didn't last long. The currant one has been in use for at least 5 years. There's another part in it that can go bad too, but I'm drawing a blank right now on what it's called.
I love the ease of "perking" a pot of water with half a scoop of Oxyclean in it. Cleans up the pot in a flash and soooooo easy! Ours is in use constantly so fast and easy is the game when it's time to clean the pot. The clean pot makes the best tasting coffee. It gets pretty sad tasting when the pot is dirty.
I have to edit the cleaning part. I just got "new and improved Oxyclean" and it's got a much larger scoop in it. So I have to suggest using 2 teaspoons or a tablespoon of Oxyclean to a pot of water. Still works just as well as I just cleaned my pot.

Title: Creative Zen good
Content:
I love this little guy once you get past THE PROBLEM.
THE PROBLEM is that the accompanying software insists that the Zen
is not connected, even though it is. I found the answer on the web.
You have to change Windows Media Player 11
back to version 10. There is a program that does that for you.
I'm sorry I have lost the URL.

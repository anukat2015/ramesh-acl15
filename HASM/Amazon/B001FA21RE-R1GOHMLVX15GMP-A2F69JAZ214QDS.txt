Title: Easy to use, but don't like the taste
Content:
Should have sampled it first, if possible, at a local store. Tried the cappuccino, chocochino, and macchiato, all of which taste watery, like something from a vending machine. Contacted the company for brewing tips but still get the same thin taste. Giving 2 stars because it is easy to use, but that doesn't count for much since it won't be getting any use. Maybe it's just the Nescafe brand I don't care for, but don't plan on buying another machine requiring "pods".

Title: oh...yes. it's all about sound quality
Content:
I just got one for my birthday. it's awesome. now i know why so many people love this thing so much
1) It's beautiful to look at.
2) It feels great on your palm and the User Interface is easy
3) Apple iTunes couldn't be easier to download music from and paying ONE DOLLAR / song instead of buying a whole with a load of crappy songs in them
4) Apple ipod is like an extra hard disk that you carry with you and you can store anything you want.
5) 4GB is more than enough for any average non-geek
6) The backlight is pretty nice
7) The earphones provided are pretty good quality, although you could always buy more expensive one's at a retail 
APPLE rocks this planet with aesthetics in technology design. looks DO matter in this world we live in :))

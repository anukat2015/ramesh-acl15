Title: I'm percolating!
Content:
I love my electric percolator.  It bangs away for a few minutes while the warm coffee aroma wafts up through the spout.  Unlike a glass carafe, it pours perfectly, no drips. The coffee flavor is smoother than my other coffee maker and doesn't shut off until I unplug it.  However, one day I forgot to do that.  Whoops.
I feel like my mother 30 years ago when I remember her making my father's coffee for him in the morning.  
I'm thinking about buying a bigger one.......

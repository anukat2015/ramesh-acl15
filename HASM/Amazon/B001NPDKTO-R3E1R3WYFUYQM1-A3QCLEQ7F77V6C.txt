Title: Love it!  Exceeds my expectations!
Content:
I've only had this notebook for 2 months but I love it more every day.  It's about my 20th laptop/notebook, and I still currently own & use five others.  Mostly Dell.  One Lenovo.
But this HP is everything I've always wanted.
I especially like the:
- fingerprint reader
- backlit keyboard
- HP custom tuneup software
- HDMI output, for watching BluRay movies
- integrated HDTV television tuner
- the docking station, which was optional: great sound, holds another 1TB HDD in built-in bay, 
The worst thing about this big notebook is that the HP tech support is absolutely horrible, compared with Dell.  They must hire any warm body that walks off the street;  it's amazing the incompetence you constantly find.  Some of these "tech support" people have never even owned a computer, I think.   HP ought to be ashamed of themselves offering up such a staff of idiots.

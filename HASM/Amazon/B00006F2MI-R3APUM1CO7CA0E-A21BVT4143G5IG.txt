Title: It can be improved!
Content:
When I bought this cofee, I thought it was one of the best coffee machines I have tried.
The coffee is very good. I brought it for the office and everyone was very pleased with the morning's coffee.
I realized the cleaning is not easy. You have to really wash it perfectly every time the coffee is finished. If the cleaning is not perfect it will be a mess when the coffee beans are grinded. I can live with this, so is not like the worst thing.
The bad thing with this machine is the steam! It goes into the electronic part of the machines, so I guess evething inside gets wet. I was going to throw away the machine just when a friend helped me opening the electronic little box and dried it. After drying the electronic part the machine worked again. 
Now we put a seal on that little part, so the steam does not get inside.
It definitely needs to be improved on that issue.

Title: good idea poor control
Content:
works good sound quality excellent. earphones bite, totally useless, unless you are sitting still. I use my shuffle at the gym, I move, I sweat. shorted out the earbuds I got from apple for $79 bucks, they replaced them once. then I decided to engineer my own fix. they do make sweat and even under water earphones but the sound is terrible.  I bought a pack of balloons the kind you use to bend and twist in to shapes etc. they are about 1/4'' wide and 10'' long. cut the end off the balloon, removed the silicone earbud part and slid the balloon over the earpiece over the control down to the part that y's. sort of a condom for the control to keep it from getting wet with sweat and shorting out. it took a little effort to get it over the earpiece then replaced the silicone earbud. end of problem with earphone control. and if you use the same color balloon it dose not look that bad or obvious, besides I am at the gym to work out and do not need to look good.

Title: You're going to love this outfit
Content:
My first digital SLR was the D70. I stayed with slides a long time, 30 years. But with digital I had more keepers at the end of the day. Everything good about digital is enhanced by this package. Everything good that you've heard is true. Get in line. It took me 6 months to get this one. You'll have a ball.

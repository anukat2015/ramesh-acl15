Title: Believe the Hype
Content:
I have been looking for a replacement for an 8 year old VAIO for the last year but nothing seemed to match up with what I wanted: 13 inch screen, lightweight, good performance.  I was considering the Sony Vaio X-series and as pie-in-the-sky as the new Dell XPS Adamo.  I was ready to plunk down $1200+ when I finally read Gizmodo's recommendations for their notebooks of the year.

When I saw how enthusiastically they recommended the UL30A, I went on Amazon and started doing the research.  The new UL30VT-X1 was causing quite a bit of ordering headache.  The demand was crazy and the supply was not.  I luckily kept checking back and happened to catch a moment when they had restocked at $799.  Considering how much I was willing to spend on a Dell or Sony, I can say that this computer cannot be matched in terms of bang for buck.
The build quality is beautiful with great attention to tactile appeal.  Granted, it smudges like crazy but you have the joy of polishing it up to look like new every time after you use it.  Think Iphone.  I had no problem adjusting to the touchpad and in just a few hours have become quite adept at the multitouch gestures.  My biggest gripe might be the narrow viewing angle for the screen but it doesn't take much effort to readjust for optimal visibility.  I would have liked a backlit keyboard and less bloatware to uninstall but in it's current configuration it's an incredible value for it's price.

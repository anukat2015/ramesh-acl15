Title: Great Camera
Content:
I love my camera. My friend was putting my camera down until we compared  his photos,(taken with a more expensive Canon), and my photos taken with the Sony A200. They were all beautiful photos, but when you compare picture quality and price, the Sony rises to the top. I going to take the $300 I saved buying the Sony and buy a telephoto lens.
Amazon also was excellent. Quick delivery and unbelievable price! A great place to shop

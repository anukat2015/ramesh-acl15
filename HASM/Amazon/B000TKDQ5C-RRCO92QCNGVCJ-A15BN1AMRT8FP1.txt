Title: Powerful heat in small package
Content:
This heater has been working well for me for several weeks now. The initial plastic smell dissapeared quickly. The noise on the lowest fan setting is not bad, on high it gets annoying. It is about the size of a shoebox, and only mildly heavy for its size. The fan and heat settings work fine. I only have it set to the lowest heat and fan speed, and it warms an average 8x10 room just fine. The only caveat is that is sucks alot of power! On high it pulls about ~10amps of power. But it is a nice small portable heater. I would buy again.

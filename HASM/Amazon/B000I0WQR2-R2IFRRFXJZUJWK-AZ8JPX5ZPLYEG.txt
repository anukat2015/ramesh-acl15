Title: Great performing, quiet heater
Content:
We bought this heater a few weeks ago from Costco for just under Fifty bucks. Much less than the $80+ models I have seen elsewhere. I was concerned that it might not effectively heat our large downstatirs bedroom/nursery (200+ sq ft). Well, my concerns have been abated. I set the heater on low and the dial to almost half way and our room stays at a nice 65-68 degrees. In our cold Colorado temps (it snowed just last night) it has performed well above my expectations. This heater makes no noise. The only indication is a green light that illuminates when it is running and a soft click when it turns on. There was a slight smell during the initial burn in, but I just set it in my garage on high for an hour and have not smelled anything since. Over all, a great little heater. I would definately recommend this to anyone

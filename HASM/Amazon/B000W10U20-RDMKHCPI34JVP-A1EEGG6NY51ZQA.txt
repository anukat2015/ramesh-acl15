Title: Nice design, performance, avg battery life.
Content:
Just got it from Amazon about a month and a half ago; haven't really crashed tested it yet, but I have a pretty good idea what to expect from this beauty.
Pros: Sleek design (good WOW factor); thin and light as advertised; good load of tech specs (USB's, HD, Ram, Lightscribe, bluetooth, wireless, webcam/mic, etc.); good performance (not one reboot or slowing down, even after upgrading to Vista Ultimate); nice screen definition.
Cons: IMHO, not long enough battery life; no fingerprint reader (becoming quite a standar nowadays); touchpad needs a little more precision.
All in all, great laptop both for work and entertainment; this is my first one with integrated webcam/mic, and that's a charm for skyping or IM.  The screen resolution is fantastic, and performance has been above average.  I use the Office 2007 package, Project, Visio stuff, not much of graphics editing.  In other words, business users can't go wrong with this, even if it's portrayed as an "entertainment" notebook; just get Vista Ultimate and you'll be ready to rock and roll with this machine.
Have a good one,
Miguel.
P.S.: Might as well consider buying a Bluetooth mouse (sincronized perfectly without proprietary software), a Quickdock station and an additional AC adapter.  Just makes it easier to work when in the office.

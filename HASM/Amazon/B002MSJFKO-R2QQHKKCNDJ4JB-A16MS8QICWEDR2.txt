Title: very good
Content:
I replaced a Braun Tassimo with the T65 and it is a very good machine. It heats up instantly and I have had no problems making any of the various beverages.
Having said that, in my opinion the Dolce Gusto makes better tasting espresso/cappuchino/latte drinks. The tassimo makes excellent hot chocolate (milka!) and 
my favorite coffee the cafe verona. The chai latte is also very good from the tassimo. The T65 also has a huge water reservoir which makes keeping it filled less of
a chore than some other brands. You can get some interesting European coffees only on their website as well as 2 free pkgs of disks for registering your machine there.
Makes a great gift and pays for itself out of ones Starbucks budget!

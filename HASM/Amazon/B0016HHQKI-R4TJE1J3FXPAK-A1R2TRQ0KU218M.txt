Title: A LEMON FOR SURE - 2 TIMES OVER!
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker at Sam's Club and loved it.  The carafe is great, no spills, the timer is great.  However, within 2 weeks it stopped working completely!  The power worked, but no coffee was made.  I called the company and they were going to send a new one but charge me shipping.  I finally got them to send a free replacement.  Great, it worked for another few months and then the very same thing happened.  I gave up and went back to my old one.  DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE...IT IS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT!  WASTE OF MONEY!

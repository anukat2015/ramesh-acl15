Title: Do not buy this unit
Content:
This is a poorly made product from a company with virtually no support. After opening the package and preparing for installation, I noticed there were several parts missing. This is a large unti and was sitting in the middle of my living room unable to be installed. I called customer support and told them I needed a solution to the problem right away, their only suggestion was to take it back to the store or wait three weeks for them to ship the part. The person I spoke to was rude and very difficult to understand. Thanks to their poor assembly I had to carry it back down three flights of stairs and return it to the store. I got another unit and I insisted on checking it before I left the store and what a surprise; this one was missing parts as well. Different parts, mind you, so it is unlikely that it was some sort of mechanical error during packing. I finally got one with everything, installed it (which is a nightmare in and of itself) and  only when it was installed did I notice that the aparatus used for opening/closing the vents was not there. This isn't a part you attach yourself, the mechanism for opening and closing the vent was never installed. Spend the extra money and buy a better brand, I will never purchase a Haier appliance again.

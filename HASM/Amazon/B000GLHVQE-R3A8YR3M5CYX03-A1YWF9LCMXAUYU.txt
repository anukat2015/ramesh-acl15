Title: Been a good heater so far...
Content:
This has been a good heater so far with a few little things I wanted to mention. 1st the door did not open but maybe that is this paricular makes feature, 2nd the light bulb burned out on the second night I used it - could anyone share how long their light bulb lasted? (also it is rather time consuming to unscrew 5 screws to replace it, 20w) My final complaint is that it does not have a setting that will automatically make it go on and off and on again.
I am compairing this with a faux fireplace I got second hand for $10.00 at a garage sale. I later found out was from 1972 but it still worked and had that feature of heat control. But it does cost a small fortune to run so the final test will be in the electric bill.
I will say on the + side it heats up a room very quickly and is very cute. I love having that cheery little fire light going for a night light. Don't even bother with those space oil heaters anymore - one of these will do the job of three of those and to me this seems much safer (take it from someone who got shocked last winter!)
So overall, good to great heater, could be better.

Title: Excellent basic coffee maker
Content:
I've had this coffee pot for about 5 years and I really love it.  It brews quickly, is easy to pour, and the carafe is easy to clean.  I've broken several carafes just being clutsy, but have always chosen to order a new carafe rather than buy a new coffee pot.  I recently bought a new coffee pot just because I thought this one was geting too old, but I was quickly dissatisfied with my new model and will now be ordering more VB12's.  Like another reviewer said, the coffee is not scalding, but definitely still has to cool before I can drink it.  What I like is that it is sufficiently cooled within about 5 mins, rather than the 15-20 mins required by hotter coffee makers.

Title: Works well - produces good heat
Content:
Seabreeze SOH7000TA works similar to Vornado heaters. Both of these are "no glow" fan based heaters which heats up the room by circulating the air. Both Seabreeze and Vornado heaters are high priced heaters compared to Holmes, Honeywell, Lasko brands etc. It is not made in China like other heaters. I believe this is made in Canada and Vornados are made in USA. So you pay higher price compared to other brands. 
Pros: It raises the temperature of a room in just 30 to 45 minutes compared to the brand I mentioned above. It is ideal for use wherever zone-heating is required. It is whisper quiet. Instead of an Oscillating feature, it has a sweeping feature, which sweeps warm air across the room. The heating element does not glow so it is safe around kids and pets. Includes many safety features; and it automatically reduces heat output as the room's comfort level is reached; and finally, it does not dry up the air like ceramic heaters. Some compare this to ceramic heaters expecting a instant radiant/fire place type output.
Cons: Controls are not digital; does not have a three-prong plug but it has a polarized plug.

Title: Totally worth the price
Content:
It was a little smaller than I expected when I opened the package, but all doubts disappeared once I plugged it in and left it on for about 20 minutes. It does a great job of warming up our office space (about 8x10) during a snowstorm of 20 inches! There is a buzz to it, as others have mentioned, but its not too loud. Great product, will probably get several more for our other rooms.

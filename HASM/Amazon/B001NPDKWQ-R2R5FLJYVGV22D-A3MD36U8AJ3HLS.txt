HP Pavilion DV6-1030US 16.0-Inch Laptop
i brought this laptop after extensive research on the net especially on the review sections of Amazon and on Cnet.
The first thing that i would say is that this laptop is a excellent choice, especially for someone who would be using it more for Home use...typing documents,excel charts, preparing power point presentations and surfing the web and watching a movie..AT THE SAME TIME. The 4GB ram is superb and allows multi-tasking.
Although for this price the processor speed 2.0Ghz and the hard drive  320GB is good but could be better.
The HP Media-Smart is a very cool feature and has excellent clarity.
Haven't used the Lightscribe yet..but should be good.
All in all..a very good package...for this price. Also looks damn good.

Title: Worst Tasting Coffee Ever
Content:
I don't know if this was a new machine or not but I have run gallons of water through this machine and used the vinegar solution twice and the coffee still tastes bad.  Don't know what material they used to make this machine but whatever it is it makes the coffee taste aweful.  I can't recommend this coffee maker to anyone except maybe my mother-in-law.

Title: Great picture quality and easy to use !!!
Content:
It took a while for me to finally decide to go digital but since i bought this camera I can't belive i waited so long. I came from the Canon Rebel series film cameras to the digital XTI and after a quick read through the instructions to familiarize myself with the controls i was shooting pics like a pro (well not really a pro but good for me). The resolution is fantastic, the included software is intuitive and easy to use. I'd definately recomend this camera to anyone short of a true professional.

Title: Great start, NO finish - Disappointing!
Content:
I seemed pretty impressed with this product when I saw it in the store. Great price, nice design- I liked the way they marketed it as a heater and a fan so it would work for all seasons. No problem giving my money to an original Indiana business [but the product was made in CHINA.] Heater turned on right away, but was a little loud; I sure felt heat, but after 5 minutes, it shut off, then turned back on to shut off again...repeat story. It finally stopped altogether, and I wasn't going to bother to "restart." The thermostat must be the problem with this unit; and that's sure too bad. I went back to the store to purchase a Vornado unit [assembled in USA!] for a little more $. Quiet as can be; warm close up, but it feels like it creates a draft in the room due to the air intake that supposedly forces the warm air throughout the room. This unit serves as a heater+fan or as a fan only, so it should be versatile. I guess I just haven't found what I'm looking for. My family purchased a couple of the original ceramic heaters when they were new on the market, complete with the heavy metal casing; they were superb in our basement - AND still work flawlessly after 15 years! These plastic cased imposters just don't cut the mustard!

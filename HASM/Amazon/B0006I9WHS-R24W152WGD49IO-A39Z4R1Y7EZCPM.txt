Title: worst of the three...
Content:
i recently bought three heaters for 20 bucks a piece... this one was the worst of the three...
as others have said... the thermostat doesn't work at all... all this heater is good for is heating a small
room that was cold... after that it either runs for a few seconds or all the time... depending how far you turn the dial... there are better out there for the money...

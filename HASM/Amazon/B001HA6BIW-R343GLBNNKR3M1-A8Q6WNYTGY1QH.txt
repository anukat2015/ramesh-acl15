Title: Looks great; doesn't work!
Content:
I got this for my bedroom (about 10x12) and it barely made a difference to the area immediately in front. This is NOT a space heater for a room, but would work well enough for a desk/cubicle area.
BUT...this unit often shuts off and refuses to start up again. I've tried unplugging and waiting, or cycling through the modes, but sometimes it just won't turn back on for quite a long time.
Long story short, I'm returning this unit ASAP and getting a larger heater that is specifically for full room heating.

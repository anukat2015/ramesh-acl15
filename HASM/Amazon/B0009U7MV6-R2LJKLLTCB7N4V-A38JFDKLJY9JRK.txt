Title: Pentax *ist DL camera
Content:
I had researched this camera for about two weeks, and decided to buy one. It is my first SLR digital camera. I am very pleased with the size of the camera, the lcd screen, and menu (Very easy to use). It takes amazing pictures when printed on my Sony DPP-FP30 photo printer, I would recommend this camera to anyone thats on a budget and wants good quality.

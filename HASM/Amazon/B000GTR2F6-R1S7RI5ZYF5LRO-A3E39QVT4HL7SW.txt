Title: Keurig B70 is LOUD LOUD LOUD
Content:
The Keurig B70 is an attractive and very convenient way to handle various coffee/tea needs of the household. All things considered, I like it and will never go back to the standard decanter coffee maker.
That said, I am confused as to why my Keurig B70 is so LOUD. When water is added to the reservoir or a cup of coffee is brewed, the machine vibrates so badly that the countertop shakes and it can be heard upstairs.  I placed a thick towel underneath it but the problem was not solved. Anyway, after paying $200 for a coffeemaker, why should I have to keep an unsightly towel under it?  
I thought that perhaps my unit was defective, but upon Googling it, found that others had the same problem. Just Google 'Keurig loud' and see for yourself. 
I don't understand why these units were put into production without attending to this obvious problem.

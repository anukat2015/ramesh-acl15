Title: EXCELLENT TOSHIBA SATELLITE U405-S2918
Content:
This little computer, like my last little Toshiba (also a 13") is a great little workhorse and, I think, built just as bullet-proof.  It is super fast and reliable.  It's light and small.  All of its functions work great.  I rate it a 5-star even though I don't like the smooth-shiny keyboard--it shows every little bit of dust and any fingerprint (a bad change to this little workhorse).  Nonetheless it functions perfectly and I'm very pleased.

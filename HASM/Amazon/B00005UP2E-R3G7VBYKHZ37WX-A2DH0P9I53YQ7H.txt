Title: We hate it
Content:
We bought this vacuum cleaner because it seemed it had the features we looked for: lightweight, bagless, powerful. The truth is it makes much more noise than vacuuming. At the end it gets the job done but when you spend a couple of minutes going over one and the same area. It is good for the stairs because of its size and weight but that's it. Overall, a very bad purchase.

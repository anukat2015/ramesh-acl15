Title: Could be MUCH better
Content:
Simple enough design & controls to program.
Base for carafe is very slick with no impressions/detents to hold it in place.
Worked fine for about 3 months, then would intermittently not feed water either manually or via timed operation for brewing.
Very disappointing.

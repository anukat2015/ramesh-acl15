Title: Makes a great cup of coffee
Content:
The difference is like night and day compared to our old drip coffee maker.  I have tried a few drip models and I don't like the coffee from any of them.  The percolator makes coffee the way it should be, because it uses boiling water.  It is also FAST.
Also, you can't beat the price.  I was considering buying a $200 bunn instead of this guy, but didn't like the fact that the bunns use a constant 30w of power to keep a tank of water hot.

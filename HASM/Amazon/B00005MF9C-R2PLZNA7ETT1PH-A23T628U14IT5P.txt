Title: Good product... great price
Content:
This little maker brews a decent cup of coffee quickly. You won't have any problems with it if you follow the instructions and not add too much water or coffee grounds. If you prefer your coffee very strong, and you add a lot of grounds, you will have a mess. My wife likes her brew kinda weak, so it works for us. When I want it a little stronger, I use a darker roast.
Perfect for using less counter space and not wasting extra coffee. I chose this maker over the others that brew two cups at once. I just use a second mug and brew two cups with this one, or brew and pour into a second mug and brew again.
If you're a professional coffee drinker, this is not for you. But if you just want a decent cup quickly, you will be satisfied with this unit particularly for the price.

Title: Vornado EH-1 digital Vortex Heater
Content:
Bought to warm an open LR/Kitchenette area that is approximately 12x18 in a very cold climate(-13 temps). Heater took awhile (almost an hour) to warm area and never became warm enough. Prior to purchase was impressed after reading the reviews, had a high expectancy. After using the unit,I am somewhat disappointed with it's performance. Previously purchased the Tower Ceramic Heater which was great and performed much better in an open area.  Vortex seems good for small rooms.

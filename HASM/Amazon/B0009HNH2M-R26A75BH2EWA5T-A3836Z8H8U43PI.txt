Title: Worst vacuum I ever used.
Content:
I never write reviews, but felt I should warn people out there considering this vacuum. I bought this vacuum spur of the moment because it was on sale. BIG mistake. Sure it may be light. But it's big and bulky. LOUD. And to top it off doesn't work. You have to go over the same area 20x to get 70% of anything visible. I have little black fuzzys from a blanket, and it just would not pick it up. Needless to say I returned it. Don't waste your money.

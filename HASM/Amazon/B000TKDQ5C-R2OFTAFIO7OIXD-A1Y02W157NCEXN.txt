Title: Perfect Little Personal Heater
Content:
I live in NorCal where the winters are not as bad as East Coast or midwest.  However, I have a good size home and I only occupied 1-2 rooms at the most.  I have central heating with gas and it costs a pretty penny and it warms my entire home even though I only occupy my living room.  That's when I decided to purchase this little gem.  When it 1st came - I was surprised at how small it was. No matter - I have a huge living room with vaulted ceilings so I knew that I won't warm the entire room.  However, when I sit on my couch with the Lasko a few feet from me - I am happy as a clam - nice and toasty and saving $$$ on my heating bills.  It works great - all the reviews about the noise - it is to me not bad at all...I am a terrible sleeper but it is truly white noise and doesn't interfere anything - TV or if I'm working on my computer.  It's a great value especially considering its price.  Very portable too for any room...

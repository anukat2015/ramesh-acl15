Title: Not great for pet hair
Content:
I purchased this vacuum a week ago and first had problems with the instructions that did not tell you how to correctly put the handle, etc. on.  Plus, they shorted me one screw!  Anyway, I was not impressed with the vacuum after having played with all of the height settings.  I have two cats and I had to go over the same spots several times to get the hair up (it just rolled the hair into balls on the carpet)  Also, it did not pick up larger pieces of dirt very well.  I had to return it to the store.  I'm now in search of a good vacuum!

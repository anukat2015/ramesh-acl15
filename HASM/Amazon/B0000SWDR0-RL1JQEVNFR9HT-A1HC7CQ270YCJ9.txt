Title: Best Vacuum I ever Owned
Content:
I have been using this vacuum cleaner for about 7 months. I think the suction is on par with the Dyson models. The relief from my allergies especially dust mites has been excellent. I have always used the 3 layer S bags. I find the foot switch easy to use. The wide floor brush cleans my hardwood floors in half the time as my old one. The cleaner comes with both a hand held power brush head for upolstery and a lerge floor one for carpets. The electrical cord retracts for easy storage.

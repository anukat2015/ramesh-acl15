Title: Absolutely Wonderful, Fantastic Camera!!!!
Content:
I had researched both Cannon and Nikon cameras when I decided to upgrade to a SLR.  I already owned a Rebel 35mm camera and knew what kind of pictures it took, but like the ease of a digital.  Came across someone who had a Cannon XT.  It looked alot like my 35m.  Long story short, I bought the XSi. It is wonderful. I like that it is easy to use, but gives you professional quality pictures.  The biggest selling point for me was that I could you use my lense from my 35mm.  The one thing I wish was available, not necessarily for this camera but for any digital SLR is a guide to lenses and attachments to enhance the capapbilites of this great camera.  It was a great purchase on my part. I like that the SLRs are available at an affordable price for someone who takes and shares alot of pictures, but not necessarily a professional photograhpher.  However, this camera will make your pictures look professional.

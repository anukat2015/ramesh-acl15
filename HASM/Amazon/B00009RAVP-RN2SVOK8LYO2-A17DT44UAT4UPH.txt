Title: The dogs love it too!
Content:
Great product, simple to use, oscillating, almost inaudible, does not generate a draft, no filters to clean, and feels like a wonderful warm ray of sunshine. My dogs love it too and camp out close to it. I've already turned down the household thermostat and I'm on my way to saving money by using this comfy little heater.

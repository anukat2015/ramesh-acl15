Title: It Leaks!
Content:
I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it, though I think he had some trouble with the frother a few times. But after two years, it started leaking every time it was used -- coffee-colored water all over the counter. Looking at other reviewers' experiences with the warranty process, I think I'll just skip it and buy a new one. Probably better not to buy a coffee/espresso combo unit again, and definitely not a DeLonghi.

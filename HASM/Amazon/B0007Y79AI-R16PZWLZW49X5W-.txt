The ipod nano 2nd generation is fantastic. the sound quality is great ,using itunes is hassle free and the battery life is good.i admit the ipod screen is very easy to break but i put it in a sock to protect it because i bought the ipod about two weeks after it came out and i found out it needed a usb 2.0 which our house computer doesn't have so i am stuck using my sisters computer which she gets very frustrated because i am always using her computer and getting the ipod when it first came  out had a disadavantage like there is no hard plastic cover for it because it is a hair longer and thinner. but overall i LOVE it and i give it a 10 out of 10.

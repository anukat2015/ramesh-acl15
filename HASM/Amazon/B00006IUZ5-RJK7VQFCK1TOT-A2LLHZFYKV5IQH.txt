Title: Great concept - lousy execution
Content:
It's very handy; almost a necessity if you drink a lot of tea, etc. We had one many yrs ago -- it was great and lasted a long time. And we have had several more since.
They are now made in China, and thus the "quality" is now JUNK. As other reviewers point out, they are apt to leak/drip, heat inconsistently [some go crazy steaming up the room], and conk out completely within a couple of years.
Unfortunately, there is no alternative similar product that I am aware of.

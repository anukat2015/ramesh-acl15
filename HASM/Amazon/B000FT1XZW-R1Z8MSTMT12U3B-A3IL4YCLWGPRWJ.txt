Title: Very happy with our choice
Content:
We got two of them after reading the reviews and really like them alot. They do a great job of all over heating (not spot heating like the coil kinds) and never get too hot to the touch. We have both small children and pets and that was a concern of ours. We use them at night in the bedrooms and they do an awesome job of keeping the chill away. During the day if needed I unplug and roll it into the the living area for the day (I'm a stay at home mom with two little boys). So far I've not noticed any increase in the electricity bill but I can't say that we use it everyday though. So far I've not used our furnace yet and hope not too but we'll see. All in all I'm really very happy with them and don't really have any complaints. 
I did turn them on high in the garage for a few hours to burn off the initial oil smell and never had an odor smell since. Also one of them does have a little tick sound but it doesn't bother anyone in our house.

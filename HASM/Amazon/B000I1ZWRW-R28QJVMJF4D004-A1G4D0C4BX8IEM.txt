Title: Great Camera for Novice
Content:
I bought this camera and 1-week later headed for the Galapagos Islands.  The camera was simple to use and wonderful photos resulted.  We carried two lenses and 3 Gigs of memory for a 10-day trip.  The battery held the charge--I had bought spare batteries and only needed to replace them once.  I was impressed! I am hoping that photograpghy will be a new love in our life, and the camera will let us begin that journey.

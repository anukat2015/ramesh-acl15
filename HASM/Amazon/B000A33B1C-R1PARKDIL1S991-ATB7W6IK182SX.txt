Title: I love my DeLonghi heater
Content:
I have owned several DeLonghi space heaters over the years and this is by far, the best to date.  It's oil filled, heats up quickly and does the job!!  I rescue dogs and have several at any given time.  I can heat the dog room in a flash with this heater and I'm not afraid they will knock it over and be burned. Now of course, I don't leave them alone with it, nor do I leave it on when I am not at home, but it is really an excellent product for the money. One caution, like any space heater, it gets hot and I would not put it in a room with small children.

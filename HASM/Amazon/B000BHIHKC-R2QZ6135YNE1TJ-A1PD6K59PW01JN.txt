Title: Great everyday coffee maker!
Content:
This is an excellent coffee maker. I had read most of the reviews prior to puchasing this on Amazon.com and I am very pleased with it! I have not experienced any of the plastic taste that others have complained about and I guess that the taste of the coffee that is used is how some review the coffee maker. I tried the Senseo pods in the variety pack and have found that one pod is good for a 7oz. cup, while 2 pods are good for the 9 & 14oz cups. Also included with the maker are three pod holders- 1 for 1 pod, 1 for 2pods, and a creamy pod holder. It is very easy to clean and the Senseo pods work and taste great!! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick cup of coffee (about one minute brew time). The downside is the noise it makes, but it is so brief, that it should not turn you away from this!

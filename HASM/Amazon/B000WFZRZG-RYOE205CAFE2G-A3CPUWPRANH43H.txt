Title: Music, Podcast, FM Radio
Content:
I debated getting an IPod, but I really wanted the FM radio.
So far I am very happy with the product. The software was easy to install and use. It is easy to add music from any CDs you already own. It has a nice interface to automatically download an update podcasts, a feature I was not looking for originally but have ended up using more than anything else. Both my kids have IPods so I am somewhat familiar with them and for me the Zune is a better option. One downside of the Zune is that if like to accessorize you don't have to many choices.

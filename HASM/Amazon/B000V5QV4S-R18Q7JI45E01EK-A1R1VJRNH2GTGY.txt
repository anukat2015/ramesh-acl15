Title: Good camera.
Content:
I don't own one yet, but i have used the Canon 40D and i really like it. I'm a beginner, and I currently own a XTI. It's been a very good camera. No problems with it so far. Comparing the two, i think they are both equally matched in quality. Granted, the 40D has more features, but both are good. I don't have a big desire to purchase a 50D(due to reviews and what i've seen), but i can't say alot till' I try one. The 40D has very good picture quality, live view, 6.5(almost 7) Fps continous shooting, and much more. If your upgrading, it's worth the upgrade.I'm looking foward to getting my 40D when the time comes.

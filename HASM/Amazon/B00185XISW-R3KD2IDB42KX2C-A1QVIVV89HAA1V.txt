Title: Whole room heater?  Who are they kidding?
Content:
Well me for one.  I simply believed what they said and I ordered this thing.  What a waste.  After 8 hours in my 200 square foot bedroom the temperature did not change at all.  However, the heater itself was toasty as was the wall behind it.
400 watts isn't going to heat much of anything.  It takes 700 watts to toast bread.  
Best to save your money.  Here you'll just waste it.

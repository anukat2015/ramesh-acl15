Title: Great Heater - Great Customer Service
Content:
I had to return the first one I received. When I plugged it in there was a little smoke coming out of the front vents. I thought something had fallen inside and burnt off because it stopped smoking within a minute or so. However, the heater never got hot and would cut off after a few minutes. I called customer service who told me to return it. I submitted a replacement order due to defective product and Amazon immediately shipped another one out.
The replacement unit works great. On the highest setting it heats up my small living room very quickly. The heat even drifts into my kitchen. I bought it so I don't have to heat up the whole house when I just need warmth in the living room. I like the tall narrow shape so I can put it in a corner. I expect to get more use out of it in the Fall and Winter. Great heater!

Title: Great little vacuum!
Content:
I've had S3765-040 for just over 2 months and highly recommend it. The included small brush attachment works wonders on the carpeted stairs and my sofa. I have a 50/50 split between carpet and hardwood floors and this vacuum does a great job for both. The controls on the handle are convenient and are a nice touch that many other vacuums don't have - suction/off and carpet brush. I highly recommend this if you are considering a canister vac.

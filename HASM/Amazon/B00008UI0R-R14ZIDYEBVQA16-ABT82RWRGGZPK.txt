Title: This Hoover is no Dyson.
Content:
So I bought this vacuum and overall wasnt happy. It didnt pick up anything. I mean I dont know what people are talking about here. It makes me think I got a defective one or something because mine really was weak where suction was concerned. I took it back and after doing ALOT of online research I went with a Dyson, DC17 Animal-ABsolute. Let me tell you what, this thing is amazing! Picks up stuff from the neighbors carpets its so strong! I would highly reccomned not getting this Hoover but instead if youre looking for a slightly more expensive vacuum you go all the way and get the Dyson. ANY Dyson for that matter. It just doesnt get any better than Dyson and with the 5 year vacuum, you are protected against any problems.

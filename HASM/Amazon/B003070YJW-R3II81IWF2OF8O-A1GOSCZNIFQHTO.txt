Title: The Perfect Laptop Desktop
Content:
AT 10 pounds, it is a bit much to lug around, except within the home, but otherwise this machine is a beauty. Lightning quick, great sound and video quality. Handles any and all applications, videos etc wonderfully. 
I use with a wireless mouse. Has plenty of ports and capability to expand. Wireless connection in seconds
Negatives: The DVD drive is a bit touchy to close (need to hold it in..not automatic close)and the keyboard area surface is shiny/high gloss, so you have fingerprints everywhere.
Battery life seems to be at least 3-4 hours (have not had it long enough to check it out.
I have a notebook for travel, so this machine fills the bill for me.

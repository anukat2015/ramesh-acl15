Title: Great machine for home use
Content:
First of all I have worked at a starbucks cafe in which I got to use the more industrial machine as well as had training in how to make the various drinks that people are so familiar with. 
This machine is definitely a good and reliable machine for home use. I have had no problems with this so far and I have owned then for some time now. It has also helped me curb my latte budget. I do recommend that whoever buys this gets a good stainless steel steamer container with a good thermometer as you will need that to gauge when the milk is ready (generally 160 degrees is good for adults, 170 to 180 degrees is good for extra hot, and 110 to 120 is good for children...at least that the starbucks way).
The brewing seems to be good. I have had no issues with the taste of the expresso at all. Please note that I do not consider my self a coffee connoisseur. I am more of a tea person but I do drink a lot of coffee and I am very picky about the brand of coffee that I drink. 
If you want a home machine this will do well and since it is a pump machine this is better then a purely steam driven machine.

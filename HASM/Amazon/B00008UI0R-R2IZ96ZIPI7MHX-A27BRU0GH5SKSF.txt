Title: Doesn't withstand the test of time
Content:
I've had this vacuum for a little over a year now.  At first, I was impressed with its suction power, but there are a couple of drawbacks that have made it difficult to use.  The mechanism that holds the handle upright is weak- mine constantly falls to the floor and so I have to prop it up against something.  This may not seem like a big deal when storing the vacuum, but I have to do this every time I stop to unplug the vacuum and empty the canister (it gets full after vacuuming 1 room).  Also, shortly after the 1 yr warranty was up, the buttons have started working only intermittently.  I have hardwood and carpet, so I'm constantly changing between the floor/carpet settings and sometimes I have to push the button 10 times with no response before it suddenly decides to start working.  Same with the suction button.  The suction is pretty strong, but when on bare floors, it doesn't always pick up everything, even with several passes.  When on my carpet (which is a slight shag), I have to use the lowest setting and move fast otherwise it seems to fuzz up my carpet.  I was excited when I first got this vacuum, but now that I've been using it for a while, I wish I had chosen a different one.

Title: Canon 50D
Content:
I bought this Canon 50D body to replace the Canon Rebel Xti body I was using with a Canon 70-200mm 2.8L lens.  The Canon 50D has a faster logic system for the sports shooting I mainly do.  I get almost twice as many frames per second and the photos are in focus much more of the time.  The view screen on the back is bigger and brighter and easier to see if a shot is going to be worth keeping, even in brighter viewing conditions.  The increase from 10.1 to 15.1 MP allows me to enlarge some shots that I take from farther away on a soccer field and still have a quality image.  I'm very happy with the 50D and would definitely buy it again.  I still use the Rebel body with the original (far less expensive) 18-55mm lens for candids, close-ups and group shots where motion is not much of an issue.
Happy Canon User

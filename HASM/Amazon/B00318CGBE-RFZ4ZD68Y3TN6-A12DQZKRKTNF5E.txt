Title: Worked for less than 24 hrs, then returned to Compaq for repair
Content:
I've purchased multiple brands of both desktop and laptop computers (Dell, HP, IBM, Fujitsu). Until this purchase, I've never purchased a Compaq, but felt confident that this laptop would be a good one, but at least for me... it's not.  I bought a dud!
In less than a day my Compaq laptop was unusable. It booted up initially with Windows 7 as an operating system, then became 'glitchy'; the screen flashed, keys wouldn't work, etc.  I spent nearly 2 hours on the phone with tech support - troubleshooting this computer - and eventually they said they would be sending me a pre-paid box to ship it back to them for hardware repairs.  While I've had computers fail due to hardware in the past, usually they are at least a couple years old, not new and fresh out of the box.  
I will not purchase another Compaq product in the future.  I will stick with my tried and true: HP and Dell. 
NOTE: If you're looking for an under $400 laptop, consider Dell or even Acer brands as a starting point.  Both have been good for me.

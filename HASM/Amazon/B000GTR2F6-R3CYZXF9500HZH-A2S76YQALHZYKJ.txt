Title: This brewer saves us so much time!
Content:
I bought the Keurig B70 about 4 months ago after much research regarding pod-style coffee brewers.  We went with the B70 at the end because of the large water capacity and the 4 sizes.  My husband and I work full time with long commutes, and we also have an infant.  Getting ready in the morning is a race - so this coffee maker has helped speed up the process.  We also love it because my inlaws drink decaf so when they visit we no longer have to brew two pots of coffee.  I like flavored and my husband likes dark roasts so now everyone is happy. I've also skeptically tried a few of the teas and have been impressed.  Next I will try the Indian-style chai as my family is from India and I want to know if I can skip the painstakingly long process of making Indian chai when my parents come to visit.  
The only downsides: 1) it is a bit loud, and can wake up visitors if used early in the morning.  2) I feel a little guilty about adding more plastic to the landfill with all the k-cups. It's not a very environmentally friendly product. 3) k cups are hard to find unless ordered online.  I finally found them at Bed Bath and Beyond, and also one of my independent grocers carries them.  
In general I highly recommend!!

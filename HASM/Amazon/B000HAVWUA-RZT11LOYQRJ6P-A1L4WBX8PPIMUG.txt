Title: Good PMP!
Content:
I purchased the 504 80 gig a week ago now and I think it was worth every penny to me. I like having a good amount of storage capacity to store video and  music for my business trips. The 504 has everything I need. 
Music playback is exceptional to me. I was able to transfer over my collection of music without a hitch. I love that I can hook this player as a mass storage device and not have to rely on windows media player to sync and transfer stuff. 
Video playback is great. With a little conversion to a playable format everything works good. I have Tivo so I transfer alot of shows to my computer so that Windows media player can do the converison for you. There  are other options for this if you look around a bit. I can't wait for them to release the mpeg 2 plugin for the 504 that will really cut the conversion time of files.
Pictures look exceptional as well. Not much needed to be said about this aspect of the player.
The two cons that really comes to mind in my week of use is that it should have come with an AC adapter supplied and the case that came with it is useless. The case can only be used for carrying the device. You can't do anything with the player in the case. 
Overall this player is exceptional in my opinion.

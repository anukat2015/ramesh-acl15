Title: bottom line
Content:
the newair 330 swamp cooler is at its best a small relife from the heat, not going to effect a whole room. if you remove the hepa fillter you will create more air through the wick. the wick is on a roller that dips into the water than goes in front of the fan, so the more water you have the more evaparation you will have. best i could do was to knock 3 to 4 degrees of exiting air, which is ok if setting right in front. i picked up two from someone that did not like them for $100.00 ea. no shipping or tax. if i had paid full price i would not be happy, but because the fans are very quite for how much air they move i can also you them in the winter to move hot air around with the hepa fillter.

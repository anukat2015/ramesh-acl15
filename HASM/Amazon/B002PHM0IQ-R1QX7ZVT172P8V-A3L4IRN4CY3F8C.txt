Title: Sony Vaio CW13FX 14" Black Laptop Review
Content:
Just wanted to write a review for my new Sony VAIO laptop..well its a awesome machine and a love it allot.. Its fast and easy to connect to a network or a device.. Also comes with good graphics with a built in NVIDIA Geforce 210 GT and 320 GB of hard drive. It also comes with the new Windows 7 operating system which I love better than Windows Vista so easy to find files and your system preferences.. So any ways its a awesome product and I'm happy with it thank you Sony for my VAIO:)

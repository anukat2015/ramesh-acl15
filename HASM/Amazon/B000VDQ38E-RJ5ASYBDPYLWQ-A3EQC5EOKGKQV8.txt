Title: I love this vaccuum
Content:
I have two dogs-a yellow lab and a corgi.  This year seems to be the year of the constant shed..dog hair everywhere!!! I saw this vaccuum commercial on TV with the people wrapped in plastic to solve their pet hair problem...I thought about it..but then I saw the vaccuum and thought it was worth a shot.   I LOVE this vaccuum. You can't believe how much dog hair is in your rugs and all the hidden dirt too!  The furniture attachments work great as does the stair attachment.  The vaccuum is  lightweight and easy to move around. I finally found a vaccuum I use often because it actually works.  I've tried many vaccuums thru the years and an finally thrilled to find one that actually does what it says it does!  Thank you Bissell!!!!!!!!!!

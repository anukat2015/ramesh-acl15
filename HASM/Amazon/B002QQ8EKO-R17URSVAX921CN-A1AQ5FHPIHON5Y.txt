Title: MAC IS GREAT!
Content:
I actually bought a year ago, but now I remember how much this comment and reviews helped to choose this mac. Ive got the black one which in my opinion is better than the white one (white one sometimes get yellowish) and although the black one does get some smudges as everyone says, they are minor, really, they will not make it look worse. IT IS THE NICEST AND BEST COMPUTER EVER MADE!! and now at a really good price (I paid $1499 for it). It is even nicer than the new one!! The new one has really good features so you might be opting for that one, but please buy a MAC. It is, really, the BEST OPERATING SYSTEM EVER!! It is easy, fast and you will like it (if you are thinking you might not i assure you that you will). There is nothing out there that can compete with the mac operating system. 
This computer is great for everything. If you are a heavy gamer I don't recommend it, but if you are not buy it or buy any mac out there!!
MACS ARE THE BEST!! It will really make your life simple and more entertaining. 
If you do buy one before buying Iwork or Microsoft stuff try Neooffice which I believe is great and sufficient for school and probably work!!

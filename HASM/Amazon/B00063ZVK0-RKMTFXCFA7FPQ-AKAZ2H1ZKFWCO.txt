Title: Not made for Northern Maine
Content:
I heat my kitchen with a pellet stove but it is not powerfull enough to heat the living room. I have a wood stove in the living room which does fine if you are there to tend it. Living area is 18'by 14'by 6 1/2' I usually fill it at about midnight and get up about 4:30 or so and it is cool by then. When I saw the good reports here on this heater I said this would be just what I need to maintain the comfort level overnight. I placed it on the floor, set it for 68,turned on my ceiling fan set on low draw to circulate the air and when I came down in the morning the best temp according to the reading on the heater has been 52. That may not sound bad but, the temp outdoors hasn't been in the teens yet. Doesn't look good for colder weather. I have a Holmes occilating tower fan heater that does just as well, and less than half the price. The Vornado is quiet, safe for kids and pets, the controls and constant readout are nice but, you would think for that much money they would have used led lights so you could see the settings in the dark. If you place it at a higher level three to four feet above the floor it maintains a steadier temp but the floor is still cool for the pets. I show three stars but, should be 2 1/2.

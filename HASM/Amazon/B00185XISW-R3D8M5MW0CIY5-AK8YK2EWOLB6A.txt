Title: Morgan's Mommy
Content:
I was really skeptical of this prodcut, but intrigued enough to purchase, and I'm quite pleased!  My daughter's room is right above the garage, and gets quite cold, even though it's "properly" heated and insulated.  We installed the eco-heater 2 weeks ago, and it's working great.  It's essentially a ceramic tile with a heating element in it somehow, and it works great in her small room (about 10x10).  I painted it, so it really looks like part of her wall, which is a big plus for me.
One suggestion that was mentioned by another reviewer is to use a thermostat.  We're using one, and it's keeping the room a perfect 72 through the night.
**Edited to add:  We've now had this unit for a year, and it's still working great!  The heat is really nice, it's like having radiant heat on the wall--a gentle warmth that's just enough to keep the room warm.  Still highly recommended.

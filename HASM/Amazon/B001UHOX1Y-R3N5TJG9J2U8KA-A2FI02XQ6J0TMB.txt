Title: Decent notebook
Content:
I like the size and general features of the notebook.  Battery life is very good, probably 4 to 5 hours.
The performance seems slow, this is my first dealings with VISTA and I am curious to see if Windows 7 improves this.
I would pay ~$300 more for a Mac the same size, but there is none available.

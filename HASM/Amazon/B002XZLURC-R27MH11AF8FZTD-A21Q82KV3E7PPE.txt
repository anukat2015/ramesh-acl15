Title: ASUS UL30VT SILVER
Content:
This laptop is very good, however, there are short comings. First, the battery life is just a speculation, you can actually get more than 5 hours but not 12 as it is stated. Secondly, apart from the aluminum lid, the rest of the body looks and feel cheap. Thirdly, the touch pad is very sensitive in any setting. However, all in all i like the product, i like ASUS product, especially with the global warranty one can have rest of mind. Highly recommended.

Title: The Best for Folks with Long Hair
Content:
I like this vacuum for many reasons.. but the best one is that it picks up all the long hair that I leave anywhere I go in our place. I have long, thick brown hair and I shed constantly so the carpet gets to hold all of that between vacuumings.
The reason this vacuum is so great for people with long hair is that it is a powerful sucker (ha ha!) with NO roller bar. This is key because with normal vacuums all my long hair gets all tangled up on the roller bar, causing the vacuum to fail eventually and burn up the belts. Then you have to take the entire machine apart and cut away all the hair. This is not a problem with this machine, and I love it!
Beyond that.. my husband and I live in two small rooms, so this vacuum is great for cleaning our space. I'm a small woman (4'6" and 70lbs) and this vacuum is easy for me to deal with because it isn't too heavy or bulky. I can't vacuum with other larger machines, but this one is just right for me and still gets the job done. I was a little concerned that it wouldn't do well because we have really thick carpet, but it really does preform fine but not perfectly. I think for the price we paid ($89.99) it's a great machine though.
I think once we get a larger place we will have a need for a larger vacuum, but assuming this one holds up I will still keep it around for smaller clean-ups.. and for a quick once over to pick up all my hair before we would bring out a larger vacuum. Even though we would have to go over the job twice, it would be worth it to avoid the ceremonial removal of my hair from the roller bar.

Title: nice, but limited heating
Content:
I've had this heater for about a month so far (November), this unit has worked well and is quiet, but the heating capacity is limited.  Granted, I have this in an underheated sunroom, and it will take the worst edge off the cold, but it won't bring the room up to temperature.  What it will do is give nice radiant heat to anyone sitting moderately close to the front of it -- we have two chairs in the sunroom as well as a hot tub, and we put the heater right in front across from the two chairs.
This is an effective supplemental heater only for a well insulated room and/or a warmer climate than the northeast US!

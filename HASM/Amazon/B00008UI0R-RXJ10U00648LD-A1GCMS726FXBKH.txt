Title: Wonderful little vacuum
Content:
Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum
I purchased this vacuum hoping it would be easier to use since I have arthritis.  I am really glad I did.  It is very easy for me to carry since it is light-weight, and it has a convenient carry handle on top of it.  I love the extension rod which allows me to lengthen or shorten the vacuum rod for either floor care or reaching up to clean cobwebs etc.  I also love the little roller brush attachment, it makes vacuuming my stairs extremely easy as well as my sofa and other furniture.  Overall I am delighted with this vacuum and would recommend it. The vacuum has very good suction which can be easily changed with a push of a button.

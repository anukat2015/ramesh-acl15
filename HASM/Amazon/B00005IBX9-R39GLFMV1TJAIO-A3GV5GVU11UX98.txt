Title: Love at first sip...
Content:
First two weeks and I am in coffee heaven. This coffee maker rocks! THE best coffee I have ever made. Nicest coffee maker I've ever owned as well!! The variable warming plate is my favorite feature. I have found Lo to be a perfect temperature setting and after 2 1/2 hours there is still no burnt coffee taste. Yes, this is THE CoffeeMaker to have. Perfect? No. Perfect enough? Oh yeah. Happy sippin!

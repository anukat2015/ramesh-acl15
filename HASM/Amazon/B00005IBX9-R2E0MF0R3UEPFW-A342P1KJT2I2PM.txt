Title: A &amp;quot;GREAT&amp;quot; Coffee Maker.
Content:
I have purchased a new coffee maker about each year for the last 10 years. Finally, I have found one that is &amp;quot;so far, so good.&amp;quot; I purchased this one at Marshall-Field in February and it's going strong. One of it's biggest features is that it has a cleaning cycle and will let you know when it needs cleaning. It has not needed it yet and we drink a lot of coffee. Oh, you can pour without leaking all over! The caraffe doesn't drip and the cover fits nicely. You can adjust the warming temp so your coffee will taste fresh for up to about 3 hours. The timer is easily programmed and has never failed us for our &amp;quot;wake up.&amp;quot;  
 The warmer has been steadfast; no crumbling surface,or paint wearing off. The stainless steel cleans easily and always looks elite. Brewing time is average, coffee flavor is excellent if you grind your beans fine. So far is much more durable than my previous Bunn, or many Mr. Coffee Expess' and muc

Title: Poor/Cheap Construction
Content:
Powerhead spinning brush wore out within 3 months, due to construction made of plastic parts, where metal parts should have been.  If you buy this vacuum, expect lots of regular repairs.  Even the Electrolux repair facilities who repaired it acknowledged this was a piece of crap.

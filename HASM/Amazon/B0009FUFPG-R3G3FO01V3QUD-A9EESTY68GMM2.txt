Title: Great, but crashes alot, support non existant
Content:
Bought this for the wife at christmas, loaded up around 1k songs quick enough, but some songs would suddenly just not play, eventually you wouldnt be able to play any and i would have to "recover" the drive (i.e. wipe it and re-sync the music). This happens like every week now.
Have emailed to IRIVER 3 times now over 10 day period. No reply. They provide no telephone number that i can find.
Going to try and return it to Amazon now, at least they give good customer service.
It may well be that i just have a bad drive, but Iriver dont seem to care about it.

Title: Very nice little player at a nice price
Content:
I bought this for my daughter who really likes it. 
Software interface and controls are pretty easy to learn & use.
FM radio is excellent as well as the unit's sound.
If I had the opportunity to do this over, I would have bought the 500k or 1mb even though this one holds quite bit of music in WMA format.
All in all, I'd do it again.

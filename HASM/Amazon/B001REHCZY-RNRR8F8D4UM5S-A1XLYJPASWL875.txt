Title: Under counter coffee pot
Content:
I am still getting used to my more modern under counter mounted coffee pot. I got the black one and it is much nicer looking than the old version. I am still getting used to the water compartment. I find it a little hard to judge how much water I have in the container and wish the hole was larger, but all in all I like it and am so glad I found one to replace my other black and decker that lasted for 12 years.

Title: Great Vacuum, Great Price, Great Service
Content:
Product arrived quickly, on-time and as described.  Purchased the refurbished version from CPO. Great product at a great price.  Liked product so much I bough a second one for another home.  Had a problem with the 2nd Oxygen: power head shorting out.  CPO did not have a replacement to send; but, was helpful in referring me to Electrolux to get the warranty replacement. Electrolux's replacement power head was wrong and they quickly send another.  Both still work great.  A solid sign  that both CPO and Electrolux stand behind their product and warranty and the hassle was worth the cost savings.

Title: Great Canon to Graduate Up To
Content:
With this camera, you deserve your cap and gown. In other words, you have learned basic photography and used a camera up to and including the level of the XSi or similar and now you want more picture definition and are ready for the challenge that comes with handling a top of the line and more demanding piece of equipment. The 7D produces outstanding results and will give you plenty of options to examine and to make practical use of. I pretty much reached the maximum that could be produced with my XTi Canon and was ready to go up the ladder. I looked at the 1D MKIII but it weighed a ton and I do not have the professional demand that that camera is made for. My dealer showed me the 7D, which is a 'crop' body which means it would use the same CF memory card and all the lenses I was using for my XTi, yet, and I mean this, DELIVERS FIVE TIMES THE QUALITY! That is in my subjective analysis of how well this camera works. Every picture blows my socks off, good bad or indifferent, the results are coming from a powerhouse of picture taking potential that has made me smile from the inside out every time I use it. If you are a semi-professional or serious amateur who is demanding and wants spectacular results, this could be the camera for you. It certainly is for me!

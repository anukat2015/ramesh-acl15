Title: Owned vacuum for over 2 years
Content:
I've used this vacuum 2-3 times a week in a 1500 square foot home, we have one large long haired dog, a cat, and a 1 year old.  I changed the filters and belts 1x year, this vacuum cleaner continues to clean wonderfully.  I can switch attachments easily and it readily fits under my coffee table. However.....it takes up a lot of closet space and the wheels busted off the brush head a few months ago.  It still has so much suction that it will now stick to the hard floors.  Also, the electronic buttons have begun to stick every now and then. I loved this vacuum but am now in the process of researching its replacement.  I truly felt I got my moneys worth.

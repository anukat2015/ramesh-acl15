Title: blah
Content:
this unit, is ok, 
it looks good and it does it job.  
i was suprise bout the size, much bigger then i thought.  
i use it for the bathroom and it works good, I turn it to max when i get into the shower and by the time i get out, the bathroom is warm.  the heating element is at the bottom of the unit probable bout 3 inch hight, so all the space between that and the top grill is just that, space.
-knobs feel crappy
-I wish the plug was on the back of the unit.
-feels cheap
-wish feet were rubberize (afraid to use on my new hardwood floors)
but it works for my bathroom.  though i might not buy again.  I like the retro oil filled on better.

Title: The Prosumer SLR Value
Content:
Summary: I'm a very happy owner after 2 months and 3,000 exposures
Pros:
   1. Quick, accurate and flexible focus with easy selection of focus points.
   2. Very good exposures in difficult light.
   3. Rapid and logical access to controls and displays.
   4. Flash metering and control, especially with the external 580exII, are superb!
Cons:
   1. Custom white balance set-up could be easier.
   2. The manual is poor enough that I purchased and aftermarket book on the 40d.
My Rig:
   1. 40d body dual battery pack.
   2. 17-85 EFS, USM/IS lens
   3. 70-200 f2.8L, USM lens
   4. 2x Telextender
   5. Manfrotto monopod.
   6. Lowepro Fastpack 250 backpack w/laptop compartment.
   7. 580exII speedlight w/Gary Fong "Whale Tail"
   8. 430ex speedlight to use as slave to 580 for fill.
Uses:
   1. Girl's fastpitch softball games. These range from bright sun to artificially lit night games.
   2. Colorguard and drill team competition. These are often indoors or on field at night.
   3. Product photography for high tech semiconductor equipment. This is usually on site vs. in a studio due to equipment size.
Discussion:
I purchased this camera to take over where my Konica-Minolta 5d and Minolta legacy glass left off in my tireless effort to chronicle my kid's lives. The KM5d was not a bad rig, but as the kids got older the action moved too fast for the KM to catch it. The main issues were the focus speed and the shutter speeds allowed by the legacy lenses. Sony Alpha made some of these issues better, but that system only has two fast focus motors - for the 70-200 and one other. It's just very limiting and about 25% more expensive than Canon or Nikon equivalents. So, I decided to change to one of the two big guys. After extensive testing, I settled on the Canon system and the 40d in particular because of the speed of operation (at least in my hands) and the price point for the items I wanted, which ended up being almost $1k less than the Nikon solution based on a D300. Also, the Canon system had lenses that overlapped range where I wanted them to, and this is reflected in the system I carry. Many other reviews split hairs on ISO 3200 performance, and  this got me going for a little bit, but the fact is that if you are pushing that hard, the photos are going to be very grainy. Slightly less or more is not the issue, IMHO. Over quite a broad range of conditions, this camera is just great. 
So, now I have the equipment performance headroom that my KM was nowhere near providing, and my photography, which did NOT stink previously, has taken a good step up. I get the action shots on a more consistent basis. The slides into second base are spectacular! If you are looking for a step up from the older Canons, or are switching to a system with some breadth like I was, this is a great choice!

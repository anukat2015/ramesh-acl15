Title: Worst Computer Company Every
Content:
""We purchased a Toshiba laptop for our daughter a year and a half ago! After 6 months the hard drive crashed and after MANY calls, all of which I had to initiate they never called back when they said they would, they finally replaced the hard drive. They made NO EFFORT to save any of the data on the broken hard drive. Guess what? After 11 months the hard drive crashed AGAIN! I was told that the computer what out of warranty, the replaced hard drive only had a 30 day warranty. They offered to replace the hard drive for $300 ... are they NUTS. They have already provide me with 2 BAD hard drives and now they want me to pay for a third. Also, please note that again NO ONE EVER returned my calls. When they said they would call back within 72 hours I waited an entire week. No Call, I called them back. I was also told that because my original warranty was expired over 6 months ago there was nothing they could do. When I pointed out the fact that it was only 6 days past 6 months and that when I made the call, that no one returned, it was under 6 months. Then they said, well even if had been under 6 months their still wasn't anything that they could do. So I concluded that the "6 month line" was some standard line and when I called them on it they just back peddled. The computer may work just fine at first, but what really counts is what the company does when things don't go perfectly and I can tell you that Toshiba WILL NOT be there for you. Avoid this company. I have computers from HP, DELL and Gateway and I can tell you first hand that you will be treated better by any other company. Stay away from Toshiba.""

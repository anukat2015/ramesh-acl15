Title: great product for the price - only negative is keyboard
Content:
I've been using this laptop for a few weeks and for the price it's a great performer.
The LCD is sharp and clear.
The Processor is responsive enough for everyday use. (not for gamers!)
Plenty of storage space and nice placement of DVD and ports.
Win7 runs well on it (I've installed already - normal purchase qualifies for free upgrade to ship next month)
The thing I LOVE about this notebook most is the battery life. 
In testing I get easily 6+ hours of real use.  
The main thing that drew me to this model was the price and the battery performance and I am very pleased with it.
My only complaint is the keyboard.  It seems minor but trust me if the keyboard is tough to use, it really cramps your appreciation of the system.
The keys are totally flat and slippery. It makes it very easy to press multiple keys, or the wrong keys when typing.
You could attach a USB keyboard but that defeats the purpose of a notebook.
Overall for the price/performance/battery life it's worth this one drawback.

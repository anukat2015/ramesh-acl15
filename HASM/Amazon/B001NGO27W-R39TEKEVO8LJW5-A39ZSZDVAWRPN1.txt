Title: feature rich but could be better from a user experience
Content:
Its got all the bells and whistles. love the coffee quality. I love the auto-off, bold flavor and 4 cup options. looks neat. It has some quirks
1) the flavor and 4 cup option buttons remain on even after the machine is switched off. gives you a feeling that the machine is always on. If you unplug it from the outlet then it loses the setting. (the brochure asks you to remove it from outlet when not in use) In a machine this expensive, these things need to be thought of and fixed.  its a cheap fix to retain settings even when the machine is not plugged in. It makes a huge diff from a usability standpoint
2) Unlike my basic cuisinart model, its hard to add  water in the machine using the carafe. The container is narrow and some water spills in other parts if you are not careful. 
3) The lid of the carafe does not have the  hinge (like my old cuisinart) for easy thumb open.  you need to be careful to not damage the carafe while removing and putting the lid back  . the carafe is 25 bucks and an expensive replacement. I found a lazy  and safe way of cleaning it. I let the water pour in from the tap into the carafe from the small opening near the spout without opening the lid. give it a brisk swirl and you are done cleaning without opening the lid. same way i fill the water for the coffee. 
performance and coffee quality wise it has been great. If cuisinart can fix the above issues, it will be a great machine.

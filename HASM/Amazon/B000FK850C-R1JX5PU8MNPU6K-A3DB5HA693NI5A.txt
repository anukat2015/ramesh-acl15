Title: Worked well, but bright, temp stopped after two months
Content:
Pros:
VERY Quiet.
Heat output is great.
Thermostat was good while it worked.
Cons:
I do not notice any Ionic breeze effect at all.
Too bright, even for a kids nightlight. 
Does not save settings so you have to redo settings after powering off.
After two months, the thermostat got stuck at 67 degrees and the heater just kept heating and will not shut off unless powered off. Now I must warranty it.

Title: Love almost everything about it--except where's the handle?
Content:
Length:: 2:39 MinsI own two of these Lasko tower heaters--this review is for the newest one which has a remote control.  In the accompanying video, you will see a detailed explanation of the buttons on the control panel and the indicator lights on the screen.  In the video, I note that the only thing I really DISlike about this heater is that what passes for a carry handle on the back of this model is pathetic...I can't see how anyone could pick up the heater and carry it that way.  In fact, when I tried, I dropped it.  My other heater has an obvious carry handle on the top.
The remote control is fantastic for turning the unit on and off or changing the thermostat from bed, from across the room, etc.  The remote contains all the controls that the actual heater has on its control panel.  When the heater is oscillating, it can be a little tricky to get the remote to "talk" to the heater at first...you just have to wait for it to oscillate toward you to click the remote.

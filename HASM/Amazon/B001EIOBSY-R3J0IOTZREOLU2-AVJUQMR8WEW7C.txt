Title: Sleek carousel for storing K-cups but...
Content:
in many instances, when you choose a K-cup from any other row but the top row, you end up knocking off the k-cup in the upper row. At first I thought it was the manner in which I was pulling the k-cup out of its slot, but it really wasn't that at all, it's the design. Friends of mine who have chosen k-cups other than in the top row, have knocked the higher row k-cup out of its spot.  Other than that annoyance, its a nice product but could use more spacking between rows to prevent cups from being knocked out of their spots.

Title: Horrible design features and overall vacuum!
Content:
I would never buy this vacuum again!
The pros of this vacuum:
1. Has great suction on carpet.
2. Is fairly lightweight.
Cons of this vacuum:
1.The space they have allotted for where your supposed to wind up the cord is too small and it won't fit there.
2. The extension hose is too short.  If they had two extensions wands, it would be fine, but they don't.
3. The attachments are also in a horrible spot.  They keep falling off every time I pull the hose out or just when I'm simply trying to vacuum.
4. It doesn't have any attachment for upholstery.
5. The canister is WAY too small and gets backed up VERY easily.  I had to empty mine 3 times to do my house and I have no carpet downstairs and a modest size house.
6.It does a terrible job on any floor that is not carpet.  Even when you put it on the bare floor settings, it just spins the debris out the back of the vacuum.
7. It's really hard to get in the locking position when you're done.  I almost have to tip the entire vacuum forward to get it to lock.  It's just as hard to unlock when you want to vacuum as well.
I hate this vacuum. I would never recommend it to anyone.

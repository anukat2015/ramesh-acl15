Title: Honeywell Spaceheater 2200  Mini
Content:
It does the job for heating in a small, confined space. I have it under my desk at work and it heats up that area quickly.  It also manages to heat up the room, but takes a couple of hours to do so...a loft with very high ceilings..it is quite noisy, but that is not an issue at work.  However, it may be an issue if used in a home setting.

Title: Solid Vacuum With Some Annoyances
Content:
The Electrolux Intensity vacuum cleaner performs well.  It's compact, attractive, powerful and quiet (when compared to my previous vacuum, the Bissell 3950).  However, after limited use, there are some annoyances which hopefully Electrolux can address in the future.  First, because the retractable 21-foot cord connects at the base of the unit, three or four feet of cord length are lost when hooked around the handle.  This make the usable cord length shorter than the specs would indicate.  Second, the large rear wheels and a lack of some sort of self propelled mechanism makes the Intensity more difficult to move and maneuver than previous vacuums I've owned or used.  This is more of an annoyance than anything else right now and probably something I'll adapt to rather quickly.  And finally, due to the rubber side scratch guards, the Intensity lacks suction power/reach on either sides of the vacuum.  Vacuuming against a wall or furniture may require an additional pass or two.  
In summary, the Intensity does what a vacuum cleaner is supposed to do well, vacuum.  Some conveniences were sacrificed for the compact size.  But for the price, this is a solid vacuum for limited space apartments, condos, and homes.

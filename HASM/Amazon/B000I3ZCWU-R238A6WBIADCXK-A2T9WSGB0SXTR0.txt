Title: love this camera
Content:
I'm a professional photographer and I wanted a really good camera for vacations and goofing around without having to lug around my "big" camera.
I was so frustrated using the point & shoot that wouldn't recycle fast enough and I would lose a lot of good images and it only had fully automatic functions.
I love this camera. It has enough bells and whistles so I can still use it like my professional camera and I can use it manually to override the automatic functions.  A lot of the consumer cameras won't let you do that.
If you want the manual feature you must get the XTi, the XT doesn't have it. 
The important things for me - fast recycle time, removeable lenses, high iso, and 10 mg pixels. This camera has all those!

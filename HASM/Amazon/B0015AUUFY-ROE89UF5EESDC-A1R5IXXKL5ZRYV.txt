Title: Such A Nice Little Camera
Content:
I recently brought this camera and was amazed by all the features.It's so small and easy to use.I'm no pro or anything but I wanted to take on a more creative role in my photography so I shopped around looking for a digital slr that was on my level.The manual comes jam pack with information on how to operate the camera.So if you haven't had a digital slr in the past don't be alarmed it's a great camera to upgrade to after using a point and shoot.

Title: Great Coffee Maker!!!
Content:
I love my cuisinart!  True I do clean it every day, but that takes all of about 1 minute (just barely more then it would take to grind the coffee myself).  It is just a matter of rinsing out the old grounds and wiping it clean with a paper towel.  I throw them in the dishwasher every once in a while as well.   This is more then overcome by the great tasting fresh coffee it produces.  For those of you who aren't afraid of using a sheet of paper towel daily, and are in a quest for the perfect cup of coffee this one is for you!

Title: Great Camera!
Content:
I own the Canon AE1 so when looking for a digital camera, Canon was the brand I stuck with. I have been wanting a digital camera for years and finally took a leap and bought the Rebel XTI which I have had my eye on.  I have tested lower priced cameras and am so glad I waited to purchase this one.  It is so easy to use and for my small hands it fits great! I love that there is no shutter delay so I don't miss shots. It may be more camera than I need, but I know I won't out grow it soon.

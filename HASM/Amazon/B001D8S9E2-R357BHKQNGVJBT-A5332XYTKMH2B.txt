Title: Another hit from Apple
Content:
You can see why Consumer Reports rated this computer tops in its class. I'm a long-time Mac user and keep waiting to be disappointed by the next one I buy. Hasn't happened yet. This machine is incredible. I love the multi-touch trackpad. The screen is beautiful, incredibly bright. Battery life is great; I can get 5-6 hours of word processing time, plenty of life for almost any flight.
System 10.5 is great and incredibly stable. I love it. Put me down as another satisfied customer... again.

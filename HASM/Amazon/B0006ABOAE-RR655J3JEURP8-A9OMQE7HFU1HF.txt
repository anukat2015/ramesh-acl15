Title: A couple of design problems
Content:
When making a 4 shot espresso you have just enough water left to steam your milk and most often, not enough -- I have to fill the boiler up past the recommended level to ensure enough steam will be produced to froth the milk 
The design of the carafe leaves a lot to be desired as poring a little to fast or a little to slow leaves quite a mess on the counter or floor -- with some practice, we have almost got the correct technique -- sometimes hard to master on those sleepy mornings -- NOT a good way to start the day
Also, trying to get anything other than your coffee cup under the frothing arm is impossible, creating another mess
I would probably not buy another one of these machines or recommend it to a friend
After all the fuss -- it makes a good cup

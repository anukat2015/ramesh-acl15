Title: Really nice MP3 player
Content:
If you're looking for an MP3 player that is "nice for the price", you can't go wrong
with this one.  It sounds great, and one thing I really like about it is, the songs
are so easy to load into it.  You can drag and drop, or copy and paste your songs
right into the music folder. The cord that comes with it plugs into your computer,
to charge it, and to load the songs.  I also bought the accessory kit that has
a car charger, and a household current charger. That kit doesn't cost much, and
I would recommend that you get it. I also bought a flexible cover for it that
cost less than a dollar. You will like that also.  If you're looking for an MP3 player
and you can't make up your mind which one to buy, I would definitely recommend
the Sansa fuze with 8 gigs of memory.

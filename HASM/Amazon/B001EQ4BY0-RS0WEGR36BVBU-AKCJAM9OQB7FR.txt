Title: Canon EOS 50D
Content:
The quality of photos is great, with very quick autofocus, and using a zoom lens with the IS feature still gives very sharp images.  There is a learning curve with all the features on the camera, and searching through the menu or book takes some time to learn, but using the features makes them easier to remember.  Indoors and in flash situations, I haven't found a way to MAKE it take a picture even with the flash unit raised.  Seems it wants to find its own focus rather than my manual focus, or something other, but this is the only irritating thing about the camera.  For outdoor photography this isn't an issue, but indoors it is.

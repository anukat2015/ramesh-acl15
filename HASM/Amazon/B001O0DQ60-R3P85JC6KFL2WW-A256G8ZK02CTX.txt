Title: Cheap, cheap, cheap
Content:
My VGN-TT has broken twice. The right screen hinge with power button fell apart, Sony blamed it on me and wanted to charge me for the repair. They finally agreed to fix it and sent it back to me with a broken left hinge! The laptop also has diagonal stripes running across the screen they cannot fix. I had a Vaio VGN-TZ before which was infinitely more solid. Save your money.

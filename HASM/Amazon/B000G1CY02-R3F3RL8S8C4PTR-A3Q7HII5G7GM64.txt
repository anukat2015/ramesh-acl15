Title: Makes a cold room warm
Content:
Our master bath is at the end of our duct system and after recent updating to the bath, it was cool in the morning.  This heater does a good job of providing heat and holding a temperature once set.  The only setback is that without a fan, you have to allow time for the heating to reach the desired temperature.  The other option would be to pay the higher cost of maintaining the temperature full time.

Title: It SUCKS....all the dust and pet hair
Content:
Very light weight and easy to manuver.  Great on bare floor and carpet.  The dirt canister is small but it makes you empty it more often and therefore the suction is always great.  Very easy to empty so I don't really mind having to empty all the time.  It has lots of great features!  I have a Hoover WindTunnel upright and I really think this little vacuum (at less than half the price) works much better!

Title: Versatile product - Good Value
Content:
I looked at several different units before deciding to purchase this one. I'd never heard of this brand before so I gave this one a little more scrutiny before ordering it to go in my office at work.  I was not disappointed. It does everything the ads described and does it quietly, which is important to me since my job requires concentration and I can't afford the distraction.  The oscillation feature is great and really distributes the air well.  If you're looking for something that feels like a roaring fireplace like some heaters do, to use in an unheated area, this would not be the unit to buy, but it does a wonderful job if like me you just happen to be in a cold area in a building that has heat.  My office is on the top floor of our building with a single pane of poorly fitted glass between me and the outside...it's too warm in the summer, and too cold in the winter.  Since I bought this unit I have not had one uncomfortable day, and it seems to be built very well. It also has the air filter and ionizer on it for fresher air--I've never smelled that musty smell you get from some heaters.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a similar unit.

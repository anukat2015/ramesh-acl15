Title: Best home coffee machine
Content:
We have had this Capresso coffeemaker for over a year, and have found it to be flawless.  We have had none of the small problems shared by other reviewers.  We did, however, put a small dab of white paint on the top's black dot to make it easier to see and position which might help others who are having a problem with that issue.  Not only has the machine held up to rigorous use, it continues to deliver fine coffee for us - and we are admittedly coffee snobs!  We recommend this Capresso coffeemaker highly.

Title: had for over a year -- works great.
Content:
I have had about 5 coffee makers in about 3 years. Once I got this one I was finally happy. I have never had any overflow problems, the coffee tastes great and I just love the look of it. The program feature is easy to use, the warming plate keeps the coffee extra hot and the two hour shutoff is great since you dont have to worry about it you turned off the coffee pot. I highly recommend.

Title: Good improvements on this version of Ipod
Content:
The 5th generation added a few improvements that make a difference: the radio, the suffle function in each category like artist or album (before you could only suffle all songs) and the camera. The down part is that for whatever reason it cannot be charged when playing in my JBL Speaker dock, so if you have one of this, better know it.

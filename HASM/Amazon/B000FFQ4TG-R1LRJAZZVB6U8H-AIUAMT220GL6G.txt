Title: BUNN NHBX-B Coffee Brewer
Content:
The bad news.  Sadly, after something over 19 years of heavy daily use our previous BUNN coffee maker slowed down and showed signs of terminal illness.  We had loved the darn thing because it really would make an excellent pot of coffee, from scratch, in just on three minutes.  The good news.  The new BUNN NHBX-B makes equally excellent coffee, equally quickly ansd is better looking to boot.  AMAZON service was as usual very simple and very prompt, and their price on this item WAY undercut anything seen in any local store or discouint store.  We are believers!

Title: A quick look at the UL30VT
Content:
There are many good reviews of the UL30VT out there already, so I'll just touch on what really stands out to me after using this computer for two weeks.
First of all, I really like the feel of the keyboard. I generally use an MS Ergonomic 4000 keyboard with my desktop system, but it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard at all.
However, there is one issue I have with the keyboard, and that would be the space bar. I have large hands, so my thumbs naturally rest on the middle area of the space bar. However, the 'buttons' on the space bar must be on the sides, as if you lightly tap the space bar, there are many times it will not recognize your keystroke. I'm getting used to resting my thumbs on the sides of the space bar, or pressing it more firmly, but initially I had many missing spaces in my writing. 
Another thing worth mentioning is that while this computer is not a games laptop, it certainly can run them. It even runs CoD2 fairly well at medium setting. This wasn't what I expected or what I got the computer for, but it was a pleasant surprise. 
The last thing of note is that if you like a certain screen brightness, or turn wireless on, even with the power save options you'll likely only get 5-6 hours of life out of your battery. This is still a respectable amount! If you drop the brightness and turn off the wireless, it looks like you do indeed get the 10 odd hours of battery life. (In battery-saving mode, etc.) 
Overall I'm very happy with this computer, in terms of performance and utility it's quite good. I just wish it wasn't glossy. It attracts dust like crazy!

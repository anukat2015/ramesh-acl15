Title: Almost perfect
Content:
Read all the reviews of such and picked this one.  
PROS:  Carafe keeps coffee hot, coffee tastes great, easy to operate, love the stainless steel look of this grind and brew, grinding not too loud 
CONS:  No tube to tell you amount of water you are pouring in BUT there are numbers inside you look in and see, carafe drips if you don't pour very carefully

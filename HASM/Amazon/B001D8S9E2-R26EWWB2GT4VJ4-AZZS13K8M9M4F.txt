Title: Almost the Best Choice
Content:
The Apple MacBook MB467 is a wonderful product and so 'right' in many ways. However, it's shortcomings are significant. The continual glare from the screen is a constant distraction. 
The other bothersome issue I have with the unit is the lack of USB ports. It comes with 2 and one is typically dedicated to the wireless mouse. A major oversight by Apple.

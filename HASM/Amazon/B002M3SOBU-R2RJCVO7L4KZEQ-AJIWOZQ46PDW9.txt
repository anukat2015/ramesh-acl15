Title: The best thing I had ever bought
Content:
I reccomend this anyone who want a small pocket cpu and music etc. this way better then buying a netbook is waste 
of money. 32GB is supper fast processor cpu. Apple make great products thanks to Steve jobs. this is the best you put this on your holiday list.

Title: A vacuum that actualy does what it says it does.
Content:
My wife is very impressed with this vacuum. She vacumed the house with our old Eureka Dirt Devil and then with the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser and got ALOT more dirt and hair to come up. It would have filled at least 2 more vacuum bags of the Dirt Devil. She vacumed our 15x29 living/dining room and had to empty the Bissell dirt container 6 more times.
 
Pro's ;
Great suction. Stylish, Nice attachments, Easy to handle like a self-propelled vacuum, Great air filtration (we used to start sneezing every time after I was done vacuuming with the old unit), Quieter than most units (I don't have to shout at her anymore if she missed a spot...LOL).
Con's :
Dirt container needs emptying frequently (2x per room, We have 2 indoor cats), Short cord holder (takes long to wrap cord up), Flex hose could stand to be longer (for stairs). 
Otherwise she works like she should, this one is surpassed other vacuums we've had over the years including, Eureka, Hoover, Oreck, even Kirby.
I give this one 5 stars!!!

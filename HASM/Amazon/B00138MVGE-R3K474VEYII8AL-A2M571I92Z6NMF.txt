Title: Great 1st DSLR!!
Content:
I bought this back in April/May after the first couple of reviews came out.  I was contemplating the Nikon D80, Canon XSi, Pentax K20/K200, Olympus E510, and the Sony A350.  I really wanted a Sony A700 but I was constrained by pricing.  Since I knew I had an African vacation coming (early October) I wanted the camera as an upgrade over the P&S that I had (Canon S70).  I liked the S70 when plenty of light is available but lowlight and flash photography are way less than adequate and I wanted more zoom.
I ended up with the Sony A350, a SAL 18250mm lens, extra batteries, vertical grip, and when it came out, a HVL-F42AM flash.  I based my decision on reviews and handholding but investigating menu systems.  The Canon XSi did not show better image quality; Pentax K20 was too much $$ at the time (same for A700); Nikon D80 was old technology; Olympus E520 was a serious consideration but in my interpretation of the reviews the Sony A350 was better.
Pros:
-In camera image stabilization: nuff said
-Larger physical size than other entry level: Olympus and Canon are too small for me.
-Legacy Minolta AF lenses: I picked up Minolta 28mm F2.8 and it is a pretty nice lens.
-Reasonably easy to learn: menu system is simpler than the Olympus, Canon, & Nikon cameras in my opinion.  I do not know about Pentax.
-Practice can make some great pictures.
-Live View: this single camera is still the best implementation of any on the market.
-With external flash pictures can come out pretty nice. IMO super fast lenses are not the panacea for lowlight shooting.  Sometimes a flash is necessary.  The F42AM is much, much better than the built-in flash.
Cons
-Sometimes I think I set a picture up correct and when I see the results, I go "HUH???": I know it is me but occasionally I do not know why.
-High ISO noise: stuffing lots of megapixels onto the sensor.
-Low frames/second
-Not weathered sealed (no Sony is): I knew this but did not realized the issue enough.  Africa IS DUSTY. Local shop cleaned the camera and Sony cleaned the lens and did a great job.
-Compact Flash: SD is less expensive and not worries about pin issues.
This is pretty nice camera and perfect for those stepping up from P&S as the Live View allows P&S operation.  The tiltable lens comes in handy although I wish it was fully articulating like the Olympus E3. The Auto mode works pretty well but the wealth of menu choices allows much customization for manual modes. In addition the availability of the Minolta AF lenses is plentiful although prices are creeping up. I do not regret the purchase at all although I am awaiting a firmware upgrade similar to what the A700 recently received.

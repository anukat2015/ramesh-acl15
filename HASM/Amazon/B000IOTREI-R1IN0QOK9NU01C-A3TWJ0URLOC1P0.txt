Title: Keeps me totally warm!
Content:
We tried lots of space heaters over the last 6 years living in Chicago. Our house is over 100 years old and lots of air leaks out through the walls! I didn't like the convection/fan heaters, becaues they dried out the air too much. I tried the radiators, and while they did heat up a room really nicely without drying the air, the electriciy bill was way too high. They don't save energy at all, we might as well just use our gas furnace. So, I bought this at Costco for about 60 dollars, and I love it. It's small enough that I only needed one, and I just carry it around the house to where it needs to be. It makes a small room completely warm, especially if you turn on a ceiling fan. It also can warm a person, and feels a lot like sitting in front of a hot fire. It's very cozy and soothing. It uses very little energy and saves us a lot on gas heating. I primarily use this in our finished attic/office, where there is no other heating. It keeps me warm in my 12x12 attic room with the ceiling fan when it's 2 degrees farhenheit outside. The best one we've had so far for space heaters.

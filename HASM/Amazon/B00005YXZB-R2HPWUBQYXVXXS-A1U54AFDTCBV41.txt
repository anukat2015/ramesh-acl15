Title: Great for Hot Water during travel
Content:
We used this while traveling overseas - mainly for heating up water.  We were able to make tea, hot chocolate, instant soup, oatmeal, etc.  It was great!!  It's a very compact little machine that makes hot water (or coffee) straight into a little cup that it comes with (which nests on top for storage).

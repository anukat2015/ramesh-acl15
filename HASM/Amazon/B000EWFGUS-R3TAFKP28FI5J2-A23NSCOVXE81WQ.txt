Title: How tall is this coffee maker?
Content:
I want to purchase this coffee maker but I need to know how tall it is.  The last one I ordered from Amazon was 1 inch too tall to fit under my cabinets.  Will somebody please be kind enought to measure the height of yours and let me know?   Thank you.

Title: One major problem
Content:
The heater itself has been real decent.  Have had this under my desk at work for some time and it really gets the room (14 x 14) fairly warm inside a half hour.  The dangerous thing I have noticed is that one of the OFF buttons actually leaves one of the heat lamps on.  I know this sounds crazy, but I have left this OFF for a half hour and the coil is still red hot and on.  Very dangerous.  Going to return with the hope of getting one that doesnt have this problem.
EDIT 3/22/10 - Thing is pretty much dead.  Its going in the trash heap now.  I never returned it as I said it would but it basically lasted one winter season.

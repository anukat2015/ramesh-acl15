Title: Good looking and works for me.
Content:
well shipped without problems, then when I started the unit, I heard some unexpected noise. It turns out one of the part was touching plastic cover so I had to do a little operation to fix it. But since then, it works fine very silent. It has 12,000 BTU. I don't know the relativity, but it cools down my living and dining area (about 400 to 500 SF). It won't make the space cold but, again it cools down.

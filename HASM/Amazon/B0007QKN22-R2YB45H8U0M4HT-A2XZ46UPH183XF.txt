Content:
I bought this camera just last week and have not put it down since.  I spent some time deciding between the rebel xt and the kd100.  In the end I went with the rebel simply because of the 8 megapixels and overall better reviews.  In fact the only reason I considered the kd100 was because everyone said the rebel was too light, felt flimsy, or was too small to hold.  Naturally when the rebel arrived in the mail I immiedately examined the build quality and size of the camera.  To be honest i wouldn't want a camera any larger, and I had no problem with the hard plastic body which I thought felt very sturdy in my hands.  Size issues aside, this camera delivers fantastic pictures at an affordable price and that's exactly what I wanted.

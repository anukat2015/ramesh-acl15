Title: Mark II 5D vs Rebel T1
Content:
Now that the new Rebel T1 is out and some of the features of the Mark II, such as video (yes 720p only) and low light capability have trickled down, that makes my choice a little more difficult as an interested hobbyist.  While I do understand that the new Rebel doesn't have the same sensor (and what that means), I ask myself if the additional weight of the Mark II will bother me.  Obviously, that is a subjective factor, but I'd be interested in opinion from those who have purchased the Mark II or the T1 (just out for a few days, so there may not be many of you out there yet).  The new Nikon 5000D muddies the waters even more.  Of course, which camera to buy is not a REAL problem, it's a luxury problem.  Any commentary on similar choice welcome.

Title: Works well but has few kinks
Content:
I just used it for the first time last night and was both pleased and annoyed. I am replacing a Self-Propelled Bagless Hoover Windtunnel and thought this vacuum reminded me more of my old Fantom Thunder, that was the best vac I ever had, but is no longer made.
Bissell Pet Vac pros:
*Moves like it is self propelled, even in my high carpet, surprised how light it feels! 
*Does pick up like my old Fantom, but slows if the dust cup gets half full
*Loved the contour pet tool, it made my steps and couch look like new!
*Stayed cool, even though I did the entire house without letting it rest.
Cons: (First is almost a deal breaker)
*Front shield designed to pull pet hair in with static is a BIG problem
It pops up by itself if it barely touches an item or corner
It also prevents you from getting a close vacuum in corners or sides on bare floors where is supposed to be pushed up. I had to push it back down on bare floors to get in tight spots since it blocks you otherwise. 
*As mentioned before, just the dirt cup getting half full slowed down the suction. It would also somehow glob all the contents in the cup over on only one side, and stop spinning and cleaning.
*Grabs area rugs fairly easily, even on lowest carpet setting. 
I will give it some more time, but it is not the beloved Fantom that I can never replace. I do believe my Hoover picked up a bit more, but it was literally falling apart in pieces after 2 years and no longer self-propelled, even with new belts. This seems a step up after dealing with the Hoover.

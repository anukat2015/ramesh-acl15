Title: GREAT TASTING COFFEE, EVERY TIME
Content:
I was never before a big coffee fan until I worked at a place that had a stainless steel Bunn industrial sized coffee maker.  The coffee always tasted so good out of it, no matter what the brand was, and I soon realized it was because it wasn't bitter, but still had a good coffee taste.  I missed the good coffee after I transferred, and didn't realize Bunn made coffee makers for home usage until much later.  Two of my aunts have Bunn home coffee makers, which seem to always be in use.  Long story short, regardless of the kind of Bunn you purchase, providing you read the fairly easy to follow instructions, you will have gourmet quality coffee every time - even if you use Wal Mart coffee. Coffee is nice and hot, a fresh pot is brewed in less than three minutes, the grounds do not splatter all over the inside of the funnel, and the decanter does not dribble.   And an added bonus, replacement parts are cheap.  
Update Jan 31 2005
To quell complaints of my office mates about weak coffee, I ordered from Bunn, free of charge, the slower flow sprayhead.  And, when I realized I could not take the regular sprayhead off by hand, I ordered, again free of charge from Bunn, the tool which is made for taking the sprayhead off.  Both items arguably should be included in the original packaging.  The new sprayhead has only three holes for the water to drip through instead of five.  This slower flow allows more flavor to be extracted from the grounds, and the complaints have ebbed.  Takes about 4 1/2 minutes to brew a pot of coffee instead of 2 1/2, which is still faster than most other brewers.

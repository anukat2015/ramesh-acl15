Title: Bangin Netbook
Content:
I upped the RAM to 4GB right out of the box very easy to pop in.  and set up was a breeze.  The computer works great however after a few weeks the one of the computers lights has a dull dim when i shutdown.  It seems to have little to no effect on the units battery life, so Im not worried bout it and you can only see it if you at the right angle but I would still buy this again.

Title: Poorly packed requiring return
Content:
The item comes in a flimsy box that is falling apart. This results in shipping damages causing structural damage to the air conditioner.  I had to rebuild the shipping carton so I could return the item. Amazon is very helpful in arranging UPS pick up and replacement. However the work involved ruins the shopping experience. I can't believe that Amazon does not regulated  shipping standards. A better box would have saved all parties a great deal of effort..

Title: Fast Single Coffee Maker
Content:
This is a great fast single coffee maker.  Perfect for that one person 'large' cup.  The travel cup actually does fit into my vans cup holder.  The coffee is hot right after it is brewed, but it does not have a heating system, so will start to cool immediately, which is not a problem.  Just start the coffee maker a few minutes before you need it and go.In this case, more is not better.  Do not fill the coffee maker to the top with water, leave a little space, about 1/2 inch.  This will solve the overflow problem.  It is better to sacrifice that couple ounces of potential coffee than to clean up the overflow mess.I really like the permanent filter.  After using the paper filters for so long, and always running out of them, the permanent filter is great to work with and cleaning is a faucet away.Overall, a great unit for that single coffee user.

Title: Like Summer Sunshine Anytime +++
Content:
These SILENT Optimus parabolic-reflector dish radiant heaters use only 300 Watts when at full power [after a short warm-up time] and are very compact -- the size and shape of a small 9" fan. From about two to four feet away they radiate a warm orange infrared heat beam about one foot wide at two feet away to about two feet wide at four feet away. I have two of these -- one aimed at my favorite big chair and the other aimed at my PC comp chair. They are easy to re-aim and move like a small fan. They have a failsafe tip turn-off contact under the base and the dish is only cool to lukewarm -- besides a small convection current rising-up out of the dish -- which I use to quickly warm my hands or anything else. So, there are three heating effects -- the heat beam directly, indirectly as it spreads away from the dish beyond about four feet and the little hot convection current rising-up out of the top-rim of the dish. So, we have two quickly-direct heat-effects as well as the total 300 Watts slowly filling-up nearby space. It feels like being under summer sunshine or near orange campfire coals. There are no moving parts or complex electronics such as motors or remotes to break-down. At about 20 bucks per dish -- these are a PRIME DEAL +++

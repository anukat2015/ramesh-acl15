Title: My new Ipod nano
Content:
I like my new nano. It holds more songs then my older model.  I still can use my old charger, I just take it off the base. I can still use my car hook up. Some people complain that that couldn't use their old hookups because of the new stye. It still has the same type of connector. It also has a bigger screen.

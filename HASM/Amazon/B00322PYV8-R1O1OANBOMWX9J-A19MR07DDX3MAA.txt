Title: Good value and Performance
Content:
I built my own f series only deference is graphics card (330m), (1080p LCD screen) , back-lit keyboard. 
Pros: This laptop is great, the processor is pretty fast. The graphics card is pretty good, i am able to play most games, cs:s, dod:s, half life, crysis mid settings minor lag, but pretty decent frame rates! Quake wars, enemy territory and Fallout 3, no lag, everything at high. The keyboard is great, though it makes squeaky noise at times still pretty good. The computer is built pretty good construction. Bluetooth has some good functions, the quick vaio assistance button is a good feature. The lcd screen is decent.
Cons: Firstly 2 USB ports! May sound sufficient for some, but 2 is hardly enough for me, maybe at least 3 would of been preferred. Then the LCD brightness, not great, it is a bit dim, brightness is not the best, my sisters Toshiba has a greater brightness at under 600$. Then the speakers, they are not that great, the sound is fine, could of been improved. 
Overall good laptop for $ 1200. Overall i am satisfied with it, it is a stylish yet fast laptop. It lacks some things which i would of preferred, but i payed for what i really wanted and needed! 
"UPDATED" To restate the 2 usb ports, i have found out that the (E-Sata can be used as a 2.0 USB PORT). So to clear some things up, this computer technically has 3 usb ports. Thanks to Mark D. Neathery.

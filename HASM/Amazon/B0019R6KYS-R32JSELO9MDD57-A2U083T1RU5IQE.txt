Title: Don't Like It
Content:
I'm in the process of taking mine in for repair or replacement and I've only had it for 3 months. The coffeee maker does not do well with batches over 6 cups.  It overflows in the basket.  In the last week it doesn't always finish the brew cycle.  I've had to re-start the cycle and shake the unit to get it to make coffee. I can't recommend it.

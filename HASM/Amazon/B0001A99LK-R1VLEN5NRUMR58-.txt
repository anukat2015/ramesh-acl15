Title: Battery Life
Content:
This is a nice product but the frenzy over it is really uncalled for.  The price, at $250, is really expensive.  I guess if you keep supplies artificially low, have a good marketing dept, and send free samples to all those monkeys at those tech websites to create a &quot;buzz&quot;, then you can justify this price. Anyhow, I shouldn't even complain as I got this free. My girlfriend won it at a conference.  There are a few things that you should consider before getting this puppy.  The battery life is NOT as advertised.  My Ipod has never lasted more than 5 hours.  The second thing is that iTune is hard to use.  It is a bit counter intuitive compared to other similar programs out there.  There are better programs out there that you can download. Save your money.  Don't be a sheep.

Title: Amazing camera! I love it!
Content:
I agonized over the Canon XT, XTi, 20D, and 30D. I decided that for now I did not need the spot meter on the most expensive models (even though I would love to have it) and that the XT or XTi would suit my needs perfectly. I was all set to buy the XT because at $[...] for the body it is great deal. But then I went to [...] and got my hands on the XTi body. The XTi is a beautiful camera and I really like the 9 point auto focus. But what changed my mind was the screen. I took a few test shots in the store and reviewed them on the brighter 2.5 inch LCD screen. It was then that I realized that I would be disappointed if I bought the XT with its smaller, dimmer LCD. If the XT had the bigger LCD I would buy it in a heart beat, but come on people! It's a digital camera and the whole point is to be able to review the picture you just took and actually be able to see it, even in bright sunlight. So for now I am stuck paying an extra $175 for the bigger screen, because I am not interested in the extra mega pixels. The dust shaking sensor and 9 point auto focus is welcome but not worth $[...]. The money I saved by not buying the 30D will go towards better glass, possibly the EF-S 60mm Macro USM.

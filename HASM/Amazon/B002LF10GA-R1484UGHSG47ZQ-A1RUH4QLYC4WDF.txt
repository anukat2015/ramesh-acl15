Title: Acer Aspire AS1410-8804
Content:
This is a replacement for a smaller, new netbook 10.1 size for travel.  The smaller unit had some punctuation half-keys and typing was difficult.  This laptop while small, has a great keyboard and types like a full size unit.  It ran well out of the box and Vista was relatively trouble free.  It also came with a Free upgrade to Windows 7 which has been added and it installed without any difficulty.  When I print on my network with this laptop using Windows 7, it only takes seconds for the printer to spool and print while with Vista and XP, it takes upwards of a minute to finally print.  I haven't had one OS or program issue and I'm very pleased.  I should have gotten this one the first time.

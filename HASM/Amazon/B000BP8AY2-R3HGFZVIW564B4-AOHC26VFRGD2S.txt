Title: Very Low-Quality MP3 Player
Content:
I bought the Sandisk Sansa m250 2GB from [...], and I was initially very pleased with the player. I liked the small size of the player, and I found it to be a very handy little contraption. However, after 3 or 4 days of receiving the player, it stopped recognizing music, and it began to leave out letters on the titles of songs and albums (for example, Blue Oyster Cult would be displayed as Bl Os C, and Billie Jean would be displayed as Bil Jn) and it eventually froze on the opening screen and completely stopped working. I called Sandisk's customer support and was told of a method to use for resetting the Sandisk, which did NOT work. Please, don't waste your money on this MP3 player. I found it to be extremely poor quality and overall a waste of money.

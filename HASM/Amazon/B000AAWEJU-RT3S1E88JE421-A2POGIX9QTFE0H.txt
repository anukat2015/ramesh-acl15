Title: This is one fine sucker
Content:
I'm really pleased with this vacuum. I love the size too. I live in an apartment with little storage space and it's nice and small but still has a lot of suction power. I've gone through so many vacuums in the last five years so I was a little reluctant to pay that much for another one but I can tell that this is a good investment, it just feels solid. It's so light and easy to use, plus I can clean the stairs with no problems. It's also easy to clean under furniture and hard to reach spaces. I wish I would have purchased it a long time ago.

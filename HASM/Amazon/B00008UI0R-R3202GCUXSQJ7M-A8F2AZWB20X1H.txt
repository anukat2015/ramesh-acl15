Title: Cleans like a mini-tornado
Content:
This vacuum cleaner looks a tad like an offshoot of Artoo-Detoo, but it gets the job done in a jiffy.  I put it together fairly easily, plugged it in, hit the button and took it for a test-drive.  It cleaned my wall-to-wall carpeting in no time at all and left it looking like new.  There's a foot pedal to wind the cord, and the cord is 22 feet long so that one plug-in should take care of a good-size room.  And the best thing is there is no yucky bag to change (the worst thing about regular vacuum cleaners).  The plastic dirt container needs emptying every three or four weeks (I vacuum three rooms of wall-to-wall carpeting once a week) but it couldn't be simpler -- push the release button, lift the container out, dump the dirt into the garbage can, rinse out the container, dry it and pop it back in.  There are a several attachments to clean the stairs, the blinds, and the furniture that work well.  This is a great mid-price canister vac that is a good value for the money.

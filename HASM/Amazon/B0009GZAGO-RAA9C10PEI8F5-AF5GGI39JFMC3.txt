Title: A little late, but I hope I help.
Content:
I recently went out to Vegas for a convention, and I ended up forgetting my camara.  i had been looking at getting a new anyway so here was my justification.  i bought this exact set up, with the 28-80 lense and D50 body.  I love it.  
Get a good carry case for it so you can just throw it around your shoulder and the size doesn't matter.  I first thought I would dread lugging it around and was surprised that it didn't bother me at all.
The picture quality is great.  I was shooting in RAW and was getting around 140 pictures on my 1 gig card.  You can shoot in the 6.1 mp jpeg if you want and get around 400 pictures, but you also lose a bit of quality on your pictures.  I also have Aperture on my Powerbook and love that I can adjust the RAW format without losing any quality.

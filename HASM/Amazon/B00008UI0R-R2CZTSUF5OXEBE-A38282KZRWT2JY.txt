Title: Best in category under $200
Content:
I've been using this vacuum for ~ 1 month and it is really great. It is really have power (even with thre power options), convinient controls location and light weight (compared with upright machines).
However I found a few flaws of this vacuum:
- the building quality are not so great, all parts are feel a liitle  bit loosely
- feel and look not like Electrolux, Bosh and other "import" machines
- the garbage can I had to change much more often then my previous vacuums
- not a good machine for small apartments, it's requires more spaces for piping, cables, etc.
Other than that I found Hoover really enjoy to use especially for the price of $200

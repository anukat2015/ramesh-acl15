Title: Soleus is bad for the environment
Content:
Plastic fan blade disintegrated. Easy to replace if they would sell the part, but they do not sell parts. Bad move. I am certainly not going to replace it with another one of their products, or buy any product they sell. They have a very environmentally unfriendly approach to after warranty parts sales. This thing is going in the landfill for the lack of a plastic fan blade.

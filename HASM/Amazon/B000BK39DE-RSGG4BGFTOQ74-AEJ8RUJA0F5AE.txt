Title: OM E-500/Good Deal
Content:
I purchased the E-500 kit with the 14-45 and the 40-150 zooms.  The price I paid for a two-lens kit was less than the price of competitor's kits offering only one lens.  
Kit lens quality is very good, better in my opinion than either Canon's or Nikon's offerings in this category.
The 40-150(equal to the view offered by 80-300 in 35mm photography) is made in Japan while China makes the 14-45.  But they both feel the same, solid.  The camera body, on the otherhand, feels a bit light and I wonder about its durability.  We'll see, I guess.  With a lens attached the camera has a real good feel and is quite easy to compose and shoot with.  Overall, pretty sharp and warm images.  I like what I'm getting.  At some point I'll put down for one of the higher grade lenses offered by OM but for now I think I'm pretty happy.  I can't comment on noise because, so far, I haven't shot in very much low light.  The LCD is big and bright.  I've read other columns referring to the viewfinder as being a bit small.  It's big enough for me. From what I've also read the E-500 might have been knocked for being a little slow, in start-up and from shot to shot.  Well, it's fast enough for me and from what I understand part of the slow start-up has to do with the automatic sensor cleaner.  Slightly slower is a good tradeoff for a clean sensor.  Besides, we're only talking about a second or so.  This is my first digital SLR and I like it very much.  I think most people would agree it to be one of the sweeter deals out there.

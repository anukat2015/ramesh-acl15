Title: Love mine - no issues at all
Content:
Not sure why others are having software issues... I run Vista on my pc and XP on my laptop.  I haven't had any issues with either and was downloading songs to it from my own music library within just a few minutes.  Haven't had to buy anything from the Zune store, and have had no trouble programming radio presets at all.  
This is my 2nd mp3 player (last one was a cheepie) so I don't know what I'm missing with this vs. the iPod, but I don't care...  I love my Zune!  :-)

Title: Ipod & Zune are good, but the Vision Zen M's the best!
Content:
I have used all three brands, and put movies and music on them. Hands down, and by far the Vision Zen M's my favorite.  Like all of the players, if you take the time to learn how to add movies & music, the Vision Zen M can't be beat for picture quality, sound, and especially battery strength.  
There's only 1 glitch that I've experienced; don't fiddle with the controls to fast forward, stop, then fast forward again (past commercials for example)take an extra moment to pause and let the unit process - otherwise the whole thing will freeze, and you'll have to reset the unit.  
I wish the Vision Zen M came with a wall charger, but I'm very pleased with the wall and car charger sold by PCMICROSTORE on Amazon for an awesome price (well worth the $6.25 + shipping).
Well worth the $$ ;)

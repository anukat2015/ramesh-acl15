Title: It's great, but....
Content:
We have three dogs and a lot of hair on the carpet.  We were using a Dyson that was fun at first but quickly became frustrating.  I know the Dyson picked up hair because the canister always got filled up.  But the Dyson had trouble picking up anything I could see on the carpet. I had to either hold the vacuum over the piece of yarn or pick up the yarn with my hand.  And I always questioned how much non-visible stuff was left behind.   
My mom got one of these Bissell pet hair erasers and was super excited about how great it works.  I read a bunch of reviews and decided to buy one.  I just got through using it for the first time.  The suction on it is great, I could hear all of the dirt that was being sucked up out of the carpet, never heard any of that from the Dyson.  I look around and the carpet looks clean, can't say that after using the Dyson.  
This Bissell pet hair eraser is great, but... I had to empty the canister about a dozen times while vacuuming one bedroom and the living room.  The canister is too small for the amount of suction on this bad boy.  It's going to be a drag having to stop every few minutes to empty the hair out of the canister, but it still beats the Dyson.

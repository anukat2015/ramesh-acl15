Title: great, troublefree coffee maker
Content:
We used to go through a drip coffee pot every 2 or 3 years. We bought this exact coffee maker 7 or 8 years ago and have never had one bit of trouble. We periodically run vinegar through and that's it. Sure makes a good cup of coffee or expresso for the price!

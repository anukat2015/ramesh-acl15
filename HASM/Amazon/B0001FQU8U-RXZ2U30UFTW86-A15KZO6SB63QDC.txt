Title: Does NOT do what it says on the box!
Content:
In the UK we had the "Trades Description Act", whereby if somebody over there sold you an air conditioner that actually made the room hotter you could sue! This is a piss poor unit, badly made, badly put together, badly designed, it is a BAD buy! Kenwood had such a good name..........once! Switch your manufacturing to China and you suffer the consequences! Avoid this like the plague, save up a bit more, wait a bit, suck ice from the fridge, anything but buy this crappy little thing! Wait until you can afford the real deal, go to a store, test and try before you buy! The Internet is NOT the best place to buy stuff like this. CDs...yes! Books...yes! Get a proper unit from an American company!! Get in yer car, drive downtown, find a family firm, ask for "Pop" or "Mom", listen to their advice, pay a bit more and you will get the benefit of their experience!

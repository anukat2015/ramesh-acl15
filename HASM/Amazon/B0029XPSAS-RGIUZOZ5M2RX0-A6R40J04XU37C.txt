Title: NewAir AC-10000E for my Office
Content:
Length:: 2:52 MinsSo I got this NewAir AC-10000E 10,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner With AutoEvaporative Technology for the office. I thought I would give it a review while one of the guys was setting up the window kit. It's pretty quiet for an AC and the fan on it is pretty powerful. It's got a handy remote (which was still in the box when I made this video) so I can control the AC right from my desk without having to walk back and forth from the window to my desk. We'll see how it goes when it gets really hot but so far it's doing great cooling the office off.

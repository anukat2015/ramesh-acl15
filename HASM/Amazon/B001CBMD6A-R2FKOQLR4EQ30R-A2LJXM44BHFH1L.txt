Title: Great entry dSLR
Content:
This is the first camera I've used that is a dSLR and I'm really enjoying it. If you've never used this kind of camera before, then I'd recommend getting a book on dSLR cameras to really begin to understand how it works. However, I love this camera. The images are crisp and it's a definite step forward as far photography goes.

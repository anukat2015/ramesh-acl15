Title: Serves the purpose
Content:
I purchased it to warm the room in conjunction with my Air Tub.  Before the room air cooled the water, but now the air remains warm and so does the water.  I found no problem with stability, but I took one of the previous reviews seriously and followed the instructions carefully.  It does not vibrate, and the only sound it makes is as any small circulating fan.

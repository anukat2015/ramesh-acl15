Title: Great 8-gig I-Pod Nano
Content:
Apple does it again with this Nano.  I've had a four gig Nano for about three years that i work out with and have enjoyed using it.  This one is even more amazing. So many features it's hard to begin.  The video and application downloads are fast and very clear.  I've downloaded almost everything on my computer and music library and have barely begun to fill up the storage space!!  So glad i gave it to myself for Christmas!! These units are very durable and dependable.  A great product for the money AND Apple is really good about service and tech support.

Title: Its okay.
Content:
I purchased the Bosch compact plus vac as a supplement to my extremely heavy Kenmore vacuum. The Bosch is quiet, light and "sucks" adequately but I find the cord to be too short and the wand fell apart twice while I was using it.  It seems a little "cheesey" for the price.

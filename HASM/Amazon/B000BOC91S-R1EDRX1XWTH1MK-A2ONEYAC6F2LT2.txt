Title: It's an over priced over sized fan
Content:
It doesn't do anything that my fan doesn't do. There is no air cooling. It just takes up space. Not thrilled with the customer service department. I've sent three emails now about returning the product. The first response I got didn't address my issue, and my second response looked like someone copied and pasted from their training manual. They even told me to contact them via email about making a return - as a response to me contacting them via email about making a return. 
The return policy is completely unclear. Basically they reserve the right to credit you or not. I'll post another review after the return has been made.

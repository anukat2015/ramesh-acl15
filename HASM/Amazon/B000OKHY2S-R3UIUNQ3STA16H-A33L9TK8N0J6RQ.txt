Title: We love it!
Content:
We're very happy with the air cooler.  It really functions as a higher powered, cooler fan, it's not like an air conditioner at all.  We primarily use it in a very large space with a small window unit air conditioner & a ceiling fan.  The combination of the 3 keeps the place feeling cool.  We've recommended it to several friends & may order more for the bedrooms.

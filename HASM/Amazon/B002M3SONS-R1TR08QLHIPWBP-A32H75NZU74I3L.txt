Title: only good because the competition is so bad
Content:
looks good and build quality is good.  BUT!
1. can only use with special headphones with the control mechanism.  I recommend ditching the really bad quality apple headphones and buying the new sony headphones that will work with the ipod shuffle.
2. It won't play any audio books including those downloaded from itunes - INSANE... i think so...
3. wont' play audio books purchased from elsewhere either
the only reason i have kept this ipod shuffle is because the others are so bad.  I tried the new little Sony MP3 player - too big.  Tried the Philips - terrible build quality

Title: Great Vacuum, Poor Electronics
Content:
I've had this vacuum for a few years now, and overall I like it.  It gets the job done, and I appreciate the bagless design with HEPA filtration.  That said, like others have experienced, the off/brush/suction switch components in the handle have broken, and I am looking at a minimum of $100 to repair the vacuum.  I was also disappointed with the onboard attachments as the upholstery brush isn't very nice, and it is entirely lacking a circular, long-bristled brush.

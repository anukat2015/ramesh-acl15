Title: Love My Nano!
Content:
The box was a little tricky to open. You have to pull out the top plastic part that holds the iPod then bend it to get it out. You'll actually charge your Nano using your computer -- the adapter is not included, have to buy it separately at the apple store. Otherwise, it's great. Songs played on it are VERY clear. Love it!

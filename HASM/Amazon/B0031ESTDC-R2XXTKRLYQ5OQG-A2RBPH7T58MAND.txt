Title: Perfect Size
Content:
Once I adjusted to the new Winblows 7 I love this laptop.  Perfect size - as small as you can go and still have a full size keyboard for EZ writing.  Good feel - I like it.  I chose this unit for the ATI graphics and HDMI output.  It is plug and play to my large screen living room TV and works a treat.  Took it on a ten hour Paris flight and enjoyed watching HD material in stunning detail that blows the socks off the usual crappy business class monitors in most planes. I got a noticeable bump in performance going to 4MB on the RAM.  Battery time is more than sufficient for a days use.  The track pad drivers are crap compared to the ones in the larger Satellites.  Hoping for a fix down the road but its usable and I paired it up with a Microslob Arc mouse that is EZ to pack and very comfortable to use.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Title: What it lacks in feature (screen), it makes up for with its size and sounds quality
Content:
This new shuffle must be held to be believed - increadibly small and great for gym / snowboarding.  Sound quality is not too shabby either compared to the full-sized ipod.  Great for some simple, reliable care-free listening without worrying about size or battery life.

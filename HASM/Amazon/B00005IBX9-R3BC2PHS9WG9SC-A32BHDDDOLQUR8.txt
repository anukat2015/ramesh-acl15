Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
I must admit, I replaced a coffee maker I got for free, so this is a big step up.  I have now used this Cuisinart for two weeks, and I am very pleased.  It produces a nice cup of coffee.  A big plus is the nice carafe.  On the down side, yes there is a replacable water filter - however, a friend of mine has had hers for a year and not replaced the filter and it still does great.  Brita water is fine.  The water well is also not well placed.  However, the front controls are great, and it looks nice, even though this brand is a fairly hefty size (will need some stainless steel cleaner).  Recommend to buy.

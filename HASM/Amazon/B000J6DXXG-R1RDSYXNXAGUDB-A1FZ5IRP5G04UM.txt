Title: Great outdoor lamp, not so sure about heater
Content:
I'm 5'3 and when this is on full blast (both rings are turned on) I can barely feel anything. My husband who is 6'0 can feel the heat but only when he is standing right under it. All in all don't get this if you actually want it to keep you warm like a propane heater. The ups are that we dont have an outdoor light and this fell into the same price range as an outdoor lamp (actually cheaper). Its not super bright but gives off a nice glow so we can see (similar to candle light) outside at night and not be in the dark. It also doesn't need to be filled like a gas patio heater and it won't violate some fire codes (NYC you can't have any gas grills, heaters etc) but it certainly won't ease the cold. 
Pros: Reasonably priced out door light, doesn't use a lot of energy
Cons: Barely gives off any heat at full blast

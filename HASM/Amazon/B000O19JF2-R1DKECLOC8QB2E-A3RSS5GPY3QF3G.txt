Title: great camera for amateur for reasonable price
Content:
This is my first SLR camera. I like it very much. Is quick, make perfect pictures. Much better than hybrid I had before.
I like "idiot" programs, because I dont care about time, or other properities.
One fault is that camera doesnt have an engine so many of nikkor lenses are useless.
If You want to have bigger choice, better take D80.

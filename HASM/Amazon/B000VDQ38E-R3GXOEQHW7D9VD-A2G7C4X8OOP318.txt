Title: not worth it's salt
Content:
My roommate bought this vacuum and I used it in our basement where my two medium to long-haired cats reside. Not impressed in the least.
First of all, the pet hair attachments are utterly useless. They're basically rubbery lint brushes. I had to pick the cat hair out of the little nubs every 2 minutes. After 10 minutes, I gave up and just used the hose. 
It seems to have powerful suction because it was lifting the carpet up when vacuuming. But upon inspection of the carpet, I still saw cat hair fuzz-balls everywhere. I had to go over each area many, many times. It'll also fray the bajeezus out of any rug or carpet edge that isn't nailed down.
Taking the vacuum upstairs and down was a chore in itself. VERY HEAVY. 
Then comes emptying the tiny container. I didn't realize where the full line was on the canister. After vacuuming one medium sized room, the hair and dust had crammed into the upper half of the bin. As others have said, it's merely a trap for hair and dirt. I pulled out the canister and most of the dust either poofed into the air or dumped on me and the bottom of the vacuum. I had to reach up inside the upper half to pull out the rest of the hair which was incredibly gross. It's such a huge flaw to have the removable part of the canister so tiny, yet the upper part of it to be so large and to trap hair.
I would never buy this vacuum. I had much more success with my $40, 10 lb., discount outlet vacuum. Tall canister, minimal attachments, extremely portable. I will definitely go back to using this.
Don't be swayed by the marketing or name brand. Unless you only have 1 small short haired dog in a single level home, this vacuum is utterly useless.

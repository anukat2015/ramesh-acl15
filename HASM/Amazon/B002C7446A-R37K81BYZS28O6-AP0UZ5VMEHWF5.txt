Title: Great little system...a stunner!
Content:
Great little product. A little on the pricey side, but then again, Dell is coming out with expensive products of their own. Still, the build quality, looks is probably still unmatched in this 13" segment. Stunning color display and I opted for the faster 2.53GHz process and 4Gig of Ram, which might add a little heat to the system when performing strenuous tasks, but I can assure you the system is blazing fast. I've had the MacBook Pro for almost a month now, and haven't gotten the chance to explore its every features and goodies, but most tasks are done easily, quickly and effortlessly. I've adapted well to the Snow Leapord OS but still miss some Windows functionality. I've pretty much used every program in the iLife 09 suite of software with the exception of Garageband. I can say the software is very intuitive, and easy to use. When importing, encoding, or exporting HD video, the processor gets tasked a little bit, and the system gets pretty hot on the bottom near the power plug. Beware of putting it on your lap or uncovered arms. All in all, the most best looking and slickest laptop I've seen in a while. Kudos and style points all the way.

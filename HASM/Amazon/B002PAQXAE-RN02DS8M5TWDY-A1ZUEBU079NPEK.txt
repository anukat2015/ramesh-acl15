Title: Light as a netbook but tons more horsepower.
Content:
I was in the market for a new compact laptop.  Looking at netbooks, the performance, even of the new Atom Dual Cores just was not going to cut it.  I opted for a CULV processor and the size/weight/price of this bad boy made it a great choice.

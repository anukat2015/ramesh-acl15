Title: Excellent spacer heater!
Content:
This space heater is very convenient to use, safe, and effective. The oscillation works good and the remote works well across the room. The safety feature this heater has is if it gets tipped to a certain angle or knocked over, it will suddenly turn off. The current heater I have is actually the second Bionaire heater of this type which I got as a replacement to the first under manufacture warranty. The first one which I owned for less than a couple of months burned out, the LED would be on but there was no response to the buttons. It could have been a blown internal fuse. This was probably due to my roommate leaving it on HIGH for an unreasonably long time, several days. I always use the temp control to automatically turn it off upon reaching the max temp. I have had the second heater for about two years now and it still works great. Some reviews I've read say the fan is loud, I disagree. The fan noise is hardly a problem.

Title: HATE this vacuum, manufacturer and service center
Content:
We bought this vacuum online in September 2002. It worked okay for a few months, but soon the plastic hose became brittle and ripped open. The company would not send a replacement hose under warranty and made us use a local service center for the repair. The service center hesitated to fix the vacuum and tried to strong-arm us into "trading up" for a "better machine" for several hundred dollars. We declined and insisted on the repair. A few days ago (less than a year later and still under warranty), the motor broke. We called the manufacturer for warranty repair and were told we must use the local service center again. We complained that this little vacuum shop was trying to force us to trade in the machine and spend hundreds on a new one, but Dirt Devil didn't care. The owner said he would fix the machine under warranty, but said we had to buy $100 in filters from him. Or, we could trade in this "inferior vacuum" for a new, expensive model at a discount. When we told him to just fix the motor and we would buy the filters elsewhere, he refused to fix the machine. He said that he had called Dirt Devil and they both decided that the broken motor was OUR FAULT and if we didn't buy the filter from him, that he would refuse to fix it. We are picking up the vacuum tomorrow and throwing this piece of [cheese] in the garbage. We will NEVER buy from Dirt Devil again and hopefully never have to deal with this service center either.

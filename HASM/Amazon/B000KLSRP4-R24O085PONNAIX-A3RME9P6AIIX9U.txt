Title: Do not purchase this unit!
Content:
I purchased this unit March 2008 in anticipation for a sweltering summer. I had read good things about this AC online. My condo has sliding windows so a window AC was not an option and I liked the sleek stainless look the Whynter SNO had. Upon its arrival, I made the mistake of running the AC for a mere 20 minutes to test it. At the first installation a bracket on the terminal end for the exhaust pipe broke off. I did not contact Whynter because the other three brackets were still intact and I could connect the exhaust pipe to the unit with no visible gaps. I followed the suggestions in the Owner's Manual for storage and put it in my closet for a couple months until summer.
Summer arrives and I attempt to use the unit twice, but the water fills up within 2 hours of use each time and it does not provide much cooling. Then, the unit leaks, flooding my floor. The exhaust pipe no longer is allowing for ventilation and two more pieces break off of the terminal end as well as the drain port plug and cap were break.
For a price of over $300.00, one would think Whynter would use more quality materials. Upon contacting Whynter they refused to take responsibility for the flooding and offered to send replacement parts to me in the mail, but that shipping costs would be MY responsibility. So now I am out $319.00, have a damaged wood floor and have been suffering through 105 degree summer heat. Thanks Whynter.

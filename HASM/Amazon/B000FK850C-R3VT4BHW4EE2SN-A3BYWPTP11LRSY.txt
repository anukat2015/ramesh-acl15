Title: nice heater, except that it broke within 2 months of purchase
Content:
initially, i was quite pleased with this heater - it was more than capable of heating the small room that I used it in.  However, within a few weeks it began making strange clicking noises and rattling which kept me up at night, and then the fan failed altogether and I'm going to have to dump it.

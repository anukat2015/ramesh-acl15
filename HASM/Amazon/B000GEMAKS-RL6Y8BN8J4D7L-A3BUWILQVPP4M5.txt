Title: Awesome Product
Content:
This is a awesome product! I am running Windows XP and all I had to do to load my songs to my player was plug my player into my usb. That's it. It is so easy to use and so easy to load songs. If you have one of the newer radios that plays mp3s and has a usb port on the front, then plug in your player and your ready to go. No cables to run, no chargers to connect. I am very pleased with my Coby mp3 player.

Title: What a piece of crap
Content:
I bought this thing a year ago. It worked great then. Now, leaves lines of animal hair when I vacuume. I have to vacuume each room twice to pick up what it left. I have 2 short haired cats and a short haired dog, it shouldn't have that much difficulty picking up everything...especially when I vacuum every week. It also smells like it's getting overheated. I clean the filter out and the dirt container. I even clean the brush heads and where the dirt funnels down into the dirt container. There's no reason for all this. The green "light" is always on too so it's not in the red. I've never had so much trouble with a vacuume cleaner. I'm getting a Dyson and putting this on the street.

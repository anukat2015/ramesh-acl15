Title: Fabulous classroom tool
Content:
I am teaching my sixth grade students how to make a podcast in math class. They are going to create their own fraction problem of the day podcast. I am excited to share this emerging technology with them and they are excited to bring their MP3 players to school - to use in an academic manner.
When I went shopping for an MP3 player I was told that iPod was the only one that would download podcasts. 
These podcasts are a part of my doctorate program at ASU.

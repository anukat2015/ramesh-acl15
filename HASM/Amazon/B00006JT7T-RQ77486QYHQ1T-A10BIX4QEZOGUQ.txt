Title: Purchased for Infant Daughter's Room
Content:
I purchased this heater almost two years ago for our infant daughter's room.  It has worked great.  Her room is approximately 13x14. We had no trouble figuring out how to use the remote.  We place it across the room and it works just fine.  We're now expecting our second child and will move it to her room for continued use (or maybe even buy a second one).

Title: this canon 500d is awesome
Content:
this is an entry level dslr but the features are comparable to a professional dslr and i'm only using an 18-200 canon lens. how much more if i am using the more expensive ones. I'm a point and shoot camera guy and i never had any problem with the shift to dslr because of the ease in operation of he camera. I did not regret buying this camera.

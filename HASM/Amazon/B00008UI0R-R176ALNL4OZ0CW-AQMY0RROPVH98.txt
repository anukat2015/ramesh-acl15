Title: Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
Our previous vacuum broke, so I wanted to get my wife a new one. Since she is the one who uses it, I asked her to write the review. Here is what she thinks about it...This is my first bagless vacuum. I wanted a canister vacuum that was light weight with suction that would pick up black cat hair. This one is very good in the weight and suction area. However, there are things I do not like about it. The bagless canister is very small and needs to be emptied a few times during the vacuuming process. The vacuum does a good job keeping allergens away from you while vacuuming, but when you go to empty the dirt canister it all flies out and you are exposed to a huge cloud of whatever you picked up from your rug defeating the whole allergen purpose. A big downfall! Also, you have to pick out the dust that sticks to the filter, thus touching all the junk you picked up. I think the only way to solve these problems is to wear a mask and disposable gloves when emptying it to lessen your exposure to the dirt and dust. Also, I do not like the fact that all the attachments do not fit on board....making it a drag to store as well as ease of use of the attachments....many pieces all over. If you don't care about these things I don't like, than this will be a good one to get for it's price.

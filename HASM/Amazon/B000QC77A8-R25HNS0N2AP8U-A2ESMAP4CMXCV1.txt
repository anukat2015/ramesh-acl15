Title: Heat or Lights which will you choose?
Content:
Okay, first of all, the style and function is great, but bc the wattage is so high, it keeps tripping my circuit breaker and everything goes out.  I am thinking it may not be worth the hassle of going outside(yes our breaker is outside) every time it goes out.

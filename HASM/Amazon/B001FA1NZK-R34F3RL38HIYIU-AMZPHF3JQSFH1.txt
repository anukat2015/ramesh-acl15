Title: Still need a computer to charge it
Content:
My touch is great.  I use it instead of a laptop since I mainly check email and surf the web.  I was also able to download a free program (livestrong) that helps me track my calories on and offline.  The main downside for me is that I still have to use my husband's laptop to charge it.  I'm sure they make some accessory so I could charge without an iTunes programmed computer.  I just haven't researched that yet.

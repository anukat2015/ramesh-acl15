Title: unbelieveable!
Content:
I've had this vac for 4 months now and I have never owned a vaccume that picks up pet hair so well. I have 4 cats (3 long haired), and LOVE this vac. The suction works great to get all the pet hair out of the rugs. This is the reason I bought this vaccume. I still use my old canister vac for the floors, and hard to reach places.  The only complaint I have is the size of the bags. I can only vaccume my large living room and one bedroom before the bag is full, but I have found a way to empty the bags and reuse them. 
Great vac for the price, and perfect for deep cleaning carpets.

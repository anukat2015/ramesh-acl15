Title: Still pleased with this product.
Content:
About every ten years or so we get a new one of these (not because they break but because they have become stained from daily use).  They do only one thing but they do it very well: one mug of boiling water quick.  Great for coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc.  I use a Melitta one cup drip coffee funnel/cone that sit on top of a mug...fresh dripped coffee in less than two minutes.

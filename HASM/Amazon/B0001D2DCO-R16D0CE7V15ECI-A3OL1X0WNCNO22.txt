Title: leaking at the base
Content:
I bought 2 units last year. At first it worked fine. Then, this season, when I started to use the air conditioners, one of the unit leaked at the base, ruining my wood floor. I thought I could just use it without water, and I found it to be very insufficient to cool off the room. I have used different models of pinguino and I found that the newer models are more problematic. If it isn't leaking, then it is the alarm light that kept coming on, shutting down the unit. I followed the maintenance procedure to clean the unit, but it doesn't seem to help. I am fed up with pinquino. I think I may have to switch back to those window units.

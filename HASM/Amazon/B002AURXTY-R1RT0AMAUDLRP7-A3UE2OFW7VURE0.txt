Title: Dont buy this if you're buying for the battery...
Content:
Computer looks beautiful. Everyone will envy you just by the sleekness. Battery life, sucks. Get 8-9-11 hrs for the first two weeks, after that if you're getting 5 hrs, you are lucky. Everything else is lovely. Problem is I brought this for the long battery life. Wish I had gotten an HP for fast performance as the processor is extremely slow.

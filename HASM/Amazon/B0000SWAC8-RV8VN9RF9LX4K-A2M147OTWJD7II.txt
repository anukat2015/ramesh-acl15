Title: VERY DISAPPOINTED
Content:
After two days of light use, the automatic breaker on the carpet/floor attachment keeps tripping and shutting off.  Needless to say it has been two weeks and I still don't have a vacuum that works.  AMAZON is also very hard to deal with in returning the product.
Not worth the money you spend.  Besides being light weight, it's just like a regular vacumm, don't believe the hype.  ELECTROLUX brags that it is "super quiet".  Well, this is true, the vacuum itself is very quiet, but the floor attachment is as loud as any vacuum on the market, so it's kind of pointless to brag about how quiet this vacuum is.  Hope this helps.

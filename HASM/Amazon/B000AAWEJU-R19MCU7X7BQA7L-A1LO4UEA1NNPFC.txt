Title: Well-built product as advertised & reviewed
Content:
This vacuum is a very well-built machine.  I have to admit I haven't been very on top of my vacuuming lately, but so far I am very happy with my purchase.  A power head for this vacuum would be great (I'm not used to not having one).  I did purchase the rotator attachment for an additional charge.  I think this should just automatically come with the vacuum.  I have too much carpeting to not have it.  I wouldn't have really known as much about it all if it weren't for reading the reviews on Amazon.  It is definitely a very quiet machine and a great compact size.

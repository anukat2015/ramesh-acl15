Title: More than expected
Content:
It's difficult to find much wrong with this camera. Sure I would prefer a better quality and faster lens, but for the price of this body/lens combination, the lens was basically free. The picture quality is excellent by any standard. I have a degree in commercial photography, and have purchased 7 digital cameras in the last 2 ½ years. I study them quite thoroughly, and this camera seems difficult to beat, until you are well over the $3000 mark. Ok, it does have a plastic body. But this is also a plus. The camera is quite small and very light weight. You will not be disappointed.

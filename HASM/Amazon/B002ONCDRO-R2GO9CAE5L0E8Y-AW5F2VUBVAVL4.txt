Title: Fan runs at high speed all the time/tech support poor
Content:
Although I've been an IBM/Lenovo bigot, thought I'd give HP a try. What a mistake. Fan runs all the time which is quite annoying. Evidently, it is a known issue with BIOS and fan algorithm. HP support is poor. I would not recommend.

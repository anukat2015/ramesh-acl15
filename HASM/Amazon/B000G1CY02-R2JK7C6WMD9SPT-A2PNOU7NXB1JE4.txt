Title: Quiet,  toasty warmth and lightweight!
Content:
I was amazed at how quiet and quickly it heats a room. I orginally purchased this for my bathroom since it is rated for that use. It was larger than I could accomodate to wall hang, so I put the wheels on and used it in my bedoom in order to lower the central heat at night. I cannot say enough about how wonderful it and my cats lay next to it without my fear of them getting burned. I do agree a temperature setting would be nice, but once you are at a comfortable level, simply adjust the dial and it keeps the room temperature stable. BTW it has a one year warranty, NOT 90 days.I love it!

Title: Does Amazon CARE?

Does Amazon Care? Amazon attitude is Buyer Beware. They are only interested in selling any product that generates income, your negative responses don't matter except to potential customers who take the time out to read them. Amazon should be more proactive and investigate the negative reviews. Offer better alternatives.

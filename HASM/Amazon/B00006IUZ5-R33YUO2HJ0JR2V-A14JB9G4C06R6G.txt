Title: A must for your kitchen
Content:
This is one of the most used and best kitchen items I own. I wouldn't be without it and I use it multi-times during the day. Who needs an expensive Japanese Air Pot when the Sunbeam heats 16oz of water to boiling in less than a minute and one half. It's speed out performs electic kettles and the microwave. I use it mostly for heating water for coffee and tea but also use it to jump start liquid concoctions while the electric stove burner is slowly (UG) heating. Highly recommended.

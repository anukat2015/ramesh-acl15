Title: Poor functionality, good brew
Content:
I'll try to keep this short and sweet.  The quality of the brew from the FME4 is very, very good.  However there are some poor functional areas.  
First, the maker prompts me to "descale" far, far too often.  I use bottled spring water and I'm prompted approximately every 28-30 brews which consist of no more than 4 cups at a time.  The manual states I should be prompted approximately every 80-100 times.  I just want to make coffee, not filter 8 oz. of white vinegar through it all the time.
Secondly, the water level meter on the side is useless.  It consistently fills with air bubbles rendering the read-out useless.  A close friend of mine has the same model and also reports he has this problem.
I would also agree with others here that the latch for the filter is somewhat poorly made but it has not failed me.  I've owned the unit for about two months now.  
Their customer service support took 9 days to return my email inquiry and they only replied with a cookie-cutter/canned email offering warranty service.  My opinion is that all their FME4 models will behave the same.  These are design flaws, not a single unit flaw.
In the end I'd advise folks not to purchase this coffee maker.

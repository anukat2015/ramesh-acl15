Title: Better than expected
Content:
Originally I have my doubts about this camera so I started to look for reviews and compare it with others.  I have very little experience with digital cameras however the Olympus Evolt E500 was easy to manage and took me an easy curve to learn. Same day I read the manual took a few photos.  The "Scenes" feature has became my best body and the explanation about the type of photo you want to take its easy to follow.  Basically there is not way you waste a photo.  If this camera is good for starters, and with the zoom lens makes you a winner.  Very good price & 8 megapixels is more than enough.

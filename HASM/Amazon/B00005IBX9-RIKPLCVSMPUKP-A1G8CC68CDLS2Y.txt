Title: This is the best
Content:
I have been using my Cusinart coffee maker for a while now. It's great!  I could wish for two adjustments.  One, it's hard to see the front of the coffee maker where it is programmed.  Second, I could wish for easier time pouring water into the reservoir with the decanter.  
It makes a great cup of coffee, that stays hot, and doesn't take 5 minutes (more like 3) to run through a brew cycle.

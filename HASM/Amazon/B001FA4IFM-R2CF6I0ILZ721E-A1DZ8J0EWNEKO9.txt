Title: works for a big room too
Content:
I am pretty happy with this Holmes HCH4953-U which I have bought recently. Compare to my recent bought Optimus H-5210 Infrared Quartz Radiant Heaterwhich only has 800W power, this is small and powerful (1500W), make a little bit noise when it's up, because it is fan active, but still consider to be silent. It is also cool as it has auto control of temperature which you can set it up and leave. We use it at bed room about 18×20, turn on before sleep, did not feel cold at all, very good. One thing I'd like to mention is I have to set it as 70 degree to keep room at 65, it's not a big deal though. Now it is Nov. not too cold, let's see how far it will go as the real winter comes in.

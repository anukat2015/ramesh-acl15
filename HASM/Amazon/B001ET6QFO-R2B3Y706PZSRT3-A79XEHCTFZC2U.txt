Title: pleased with eos 50d as an upgrade from eos 20d
Content:
this made a fine upgrade from an ailing eos 20d. i appreciate the direct compatibility of my existing canon flash, compactflash media, my lenses, and my batteries. i like the eos 50d's high-speed mode, the automatic ISO option, and the shutter-speed-bracketing for HDR.
my only small grievance is the ease with which the mode-selection dial can be altered, i've accidentally switched the camera out of my preferred mode several times, only to notice several minutes or several hours later. ouch.

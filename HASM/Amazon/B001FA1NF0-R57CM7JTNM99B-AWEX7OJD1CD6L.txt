Title: Gave an iPod to my wife for Christmas
Content:
My wife loved the iPod!  I was extremely satisfied with the prompt shipping (arrived in less than 24hrs after the order was placed). We had seen the 8GB version at Wal-Mart the weekend before; she mentioned that might be something useful for her (she is a music teacher).  Wal-Mart would have to order the 16GB version (days before Christmas!).  Thanks for your assistance!

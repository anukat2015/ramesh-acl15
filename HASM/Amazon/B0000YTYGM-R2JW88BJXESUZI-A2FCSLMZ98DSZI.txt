Title: Not as reliable as Krups
Content:
I bought this 5 years ago and it has worked wonderfully everyday since it's purchase.  Unfortunately it stopped working after only 5 years.  A coffee maker, especially high priced like this one, should last me ten years.  I have a Krups that is also used daily and it is 18 years old and was only a fourth of the price.  I will only be buying Krups in the future and will pour my coffee in a carafe.

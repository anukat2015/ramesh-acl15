Title: A HOT Buy!
Content:
I have to admit that when I first received our heaters (we ordered three) and saw the size, I was skeptical about whether they would be able to generate enough heat to allow us to not use our forced air heating system. Well, let me just say that Lasko has made a believer out of me! We have a rather spacious master bedroom and on almost the lowest temperature setting the unit was able to keep us comfortably toasty all night long.
While it may not be the quietest model on the market, the noise that it does make is simply "white noise" and actually helped me to sleep better.
At this price, the Lasko 754200 ceramic heater is one HOT bargain!!!

Title: Best vacuum I have had in my entire life!
Content:
I have had this vacuum for about a month.  I did sweeep with it right after sweeping with my old one for a test and you wouldn't believe how much more it sucked up!  Also, it is the quietest vacuum I have ever seen.  Yes, it makes noise but it is probably not even half as loud as other vacuums.  You can change from carpets to bare floors with the touch of a button.  Accessories are easily taken on and off.  The handle pipe extends with the touch of a button.  I couldn't be more pleased!  It was absolutely like new...couldn't tell it had ever been used and I received it in just a few days.  A great buy and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I just wish I had had it before now.  Do not hesitate to purchase this item.

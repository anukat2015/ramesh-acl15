Title: Definitely Worth it!
Content:
I have been suspect of my 6 year old vacuum for quite some time now and was tired of trying to find the right bags and feeling like I was changing out the bags after every vacuum.  I was drawn to this bissell because of the lift-off canister and the bagless system.  After reading more positive than negative reviews I went for it!  I AM SO GLAD I DID!  I gave it a test drive after I brought it home and was amazed at the amount of stuff it picked up!  And I just vacuumed with my old vacuum yesterday!  I am now certain that my carpets and stairs and floors are clean!  Definitely worth it and the price isn't out of this world either!

Title: Works well but is bulky and the surface gets very hot
Content:
I bought this heater because of it's excellent safety rating on Consumer Reports as well as it's low noise. I have mixed feelings about it but it does heat well. Here are a list of my likes and dislikes.
Pros: 
Quiet - No fan so no noise.
Safe Power Cord - Many heater fires are cause by undersized power cables.  Heaters use tons of power and tons of power through small power cords create heat which can create fires.  Safety labels warn about never putting power cords underneath things and this is why.  The cord on this unit is fairly heavy gauge with a ground so it seems that this risk is minimized.
Reasonably well built - The unit seems solid and well built.
Cons:
Large Size - It takes up quite a bit of room. 3 feet wide !
Hot Surface - While the cord may be safe, the grill gets very hot.  I bought this for our baby's room but once she can walk, I'll have to replace it as the surface of this heater is extremely hot.  In fact, I'd worry that anything getting near it could catch fire.  It has a warning badge to tell you that the surface is hot but why not use something other then metal for the grill which wouldn't burn ?
Timer Limited to 10 hours - Why the limit ??
Thermostat has no memory - You have to reset it each time you power on.

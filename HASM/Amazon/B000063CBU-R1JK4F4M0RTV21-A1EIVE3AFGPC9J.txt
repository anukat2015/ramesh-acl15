Title: Delonghi BC0110 Caffe Figaro Espresso,Cappuccino&amp;Coffee Bar
Content:
I bought this machine about 2 monthes ago. I use it daily, I love being able to set the timer and have hot ,fresh ,strong coffee ready for me when I get up! I have experienced on a couple of different occasions that there was water that had dripped out all over the counter, but still made coffee, Im not to sure what happened? I have also found that the espresso part of the machine does not brew the coffee as strong as I would like it, regardless of the type of espresso coffee I use. I use skim milk in the frother part and have experienced hot frothy milk, and I havent found it difficult to clean as long as you do it shortly after use. Over all Im pretty happy with the machine but may have expected more for the money!

This vacuum is absolutly wonderful!!! I researched for days upon days to the point where people were calling it an obsession ;) This seemed to be the most logical choice.  I decided on canister vacuum though I have never had one because I have a large kitchen and I wanted to do the lanolium in there with ease.  Well this does the job.  I have burber throughout the rest of the house and this vacuum cleans it like a champ! I wanted bagless because I hate the cost and hassel of bags.  This is the first REAL vacuum Ive bought.  Others have been dirt devils lol.  I got this with free shipping at the buzz electronics for 193.99!  Mine is model S3765-040 But I cant find the difference between this one and mine. Mine has the attachement with the brushes in it too.  This is the only place I could find the model they have listed.  So if you want a GREAT vacuum this is the one!

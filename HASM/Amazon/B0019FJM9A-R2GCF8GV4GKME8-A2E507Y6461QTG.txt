Title: Olympus E-520 camera review purchased from Amazon.com
Content:
Over the months I reviewed numerous camera's before purchasing the Olympus E-520 w/14-42 lens. I looked at Nikon, Cannon, Pentax, Sony and the normal brand name camera's. I went to the stores and visually reviewed and handled each camera asking questions with a knowledgable saleperson Olympus, by far, was the best choice for me when you compare price verses bang for the buck. I have been completely satisfied. It takes excellent pictures and has all the versitality necessary for your everyday photo requirements. There are always pro's and con's on every camera and it becomes confusing if you do enought searching, but the Olympus E-520 won me over. I ordered this camera from Amazon on a Friday and had it on the following Monday. Excellent job Amazon! You actually shipped it within an hour of me completing the online order with a confirmation email. WOW! For someone looking for a camera, the Olympus E-520 is a great choice and Amazon is the place to buy it........

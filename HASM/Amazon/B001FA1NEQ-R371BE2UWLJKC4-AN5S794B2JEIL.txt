Title: it is very orange
Content:
So I've been using this for a while now. Just so I could listen to it in my Civic I had to install one of those special cables. (I didn't want no FM transmitter solution that plugs into cigarette lighter) But it was the older cable didn't support charging this iPod. Bought one of those scoche passports. That solved that problem. As far as iPod - it works. I don't use iTunes. Just Winamp. Nice hardware, very light. I think iPhone and Touch are too big to take to the gym. This is the perfect size.

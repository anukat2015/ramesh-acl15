Title: Canon is the Best Brand.
Content:
Before I bought this camera I was trying to pick between the Nikon and Canon. With a lot of research and talking to many professionals I knew the Canon was the best choice. Now that I owned the camera for 4 months I still love it. Many of my friends have other bands like Olympus and Pentax and I still love mine the best.
A family member owned a point and shoot camera for 5 years, way pasted warranty, the camera started having problems taking pictures so we called up Canon, they payed for all the shipping and repaired it for free. A friend of the family had a Nikon just past the warranty of a year and he tied to have Nikon fix it and they would not.
All in all this camera is a winner in my book and between Nikon and Canon, Canon is a winner in my book.

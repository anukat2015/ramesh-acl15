Title: Very good vacuum cleaner.
Content:
I purchased this vacuum to replace a Sharp we had for many years.  This vacuum does the job in lifting our rescue dog pet hair.  It's reassuring to watch the debris spin about in the clear container.  Most of the debris is pet hair that I don't see in the carpet.  I've had this item for 2 weeks and am very satisfied.  On the downside, it is heavy and not easy to use on stairs.  I use a smaller 'broom-type' vacuum on the stairs.  The outside of this vacuum is mostly plastic and I wonder about it's longterm durability.  But overall I believe it's a good value and am satisfied with the results.

Title: I love my new miele antares - love it
Content:
Used to live with wall to wall carpet, and used an Oreck.  Having finally gotten wood floors, did a lot of research and settled on the Miele Antares.    Confused by the review where the person said they didn't get a turbo nozzle or parquet tool - these are standard with the antares, and much appreciated.  only thing i bought extra was a HEPA filter, as I have cats and allergies.
from the moment I opened the box, i was in love with the miele.  so well made, so solid yet so light, much smaller than I expected, and a joy to use.  very strong suction at top level, and pretty quiet. if you think the cord is too short, that may be because you are whizzing so quickly and easily from room to room that you forget that you need to switch to another socket.  most vacuums have similar length cords. 
and finally, my boyfriend--who had completely failed to understand why my upright was no longer useful to me and had declared his intention of inheriting it--tried my miele for 10 minutes and immediately ordered one for himself.  
in short, this vacuum is wonderful for hard floors and low to medium area rugs, not to mention cleaning dust out of light fixtures, getting right under the appliances with the crevice tool, etc etc.   I can't speak to th issue of wall to wall or shag rugs, but miele is such high quality i'm sure they have a model for you.

Title: It is a good computer
Content:
For me, it takes a while to get used to. It is a little different from my desktop at home, though the desktop at home is about 4 years old. The battery life seems to last about 2 hours of active use and 2 hours of hibernation/sleep mode. I took it on me on a 5 1/2 car ride. Over all, it has great performance. I loaded 20 shows of Yo Gabba Gabba and 5 shows of the Fresh Beat Band. So, it has lots of great memory. I guess my concern is the battery life. I like the computer and still am learning about it. Any suggestions would be great.

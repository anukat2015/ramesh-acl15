Title: Nostalgia for Mom
Content:
My mom is 89 and had just lost her "buddy" a few months ago.  She was very lonely and missed their talks about the depression and World War 2 and missed the "big band" sound of the times.  She would say, "if I could only listen to that music every day it would give me such joy".  Her stereo and CD system didn't work at the time and the radio wasn't playing this type of music very often.  So, I decided to get her a Nano Ipod for Mothers Day.  My son downloaded the music from her list and showed Mom how to use it.  She tells me everyday how happy her music makes her and how easy it is to use.  I thank you for a wonderful product.

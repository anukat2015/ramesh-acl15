Title: Poor Wireless
Content:
Overall I love this computer, but I am having constant issues with the installed wireless device.  It refuses to connect to any routers except the occasional 20 minute span here and there.  I have researched online and found this is due to a defect issue with the hardware used and Windows 7 compatibility with various routers.  I have tried it with a NetGear router as well as a Linksys Router.  I have upgraded all firmware and even upgraded the Laptop's drivers for the wireless device.  Still having issues.  I will continue to find a better solution to it, but I fear I may have to break down and buy a USB adapter to get my wireless connection for this laptop.

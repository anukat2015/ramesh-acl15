Title: If you are looking for the perfect vaccum, look no further....
Content:
I bought this vaccum a few months ago after much research on different sites.  This is by far the best vaccum that I have ever owned.  I just love the design, which makes it easy to clean virtually anywhere in your home...ie...under the coffee table, chairs, sofas, stairs, corners....all the hard to reach places will be easily accessible with this gem.  And, the good thing is that it is lightweight and has super suction power.  The wheels slide very easily, allowing the vaccum to follow you without much effort and the retractible plug is just an extra added bonus(it doesn't get stuck like most other similar pieces).  It works great on hardwood floors as well. Now, with all that being said, there is actually a draw back to this wonderful piece of equipment - the darn filter and canister....you have to empty it practically after every room (but is amazing to see all the stuff that came off of your carpet)...I have a carpet that sheds (like most new carpets do) so, I have to clean the filter and canister quite often.  Yet in spite of this, I love the results so much that I would not trade it for anything...it is very durable and quiet as well.  And, if you have any wool throw rugs that shed horribly like I do, you will be quite pleased with this vaccum...previously, my other vaccums would not do the trick on my large wool rug in my family room (leaving lint and the like).  I can't say enough good about this vaccum.....I think that is one of Hoover's better products and I have had many uprights made by them....

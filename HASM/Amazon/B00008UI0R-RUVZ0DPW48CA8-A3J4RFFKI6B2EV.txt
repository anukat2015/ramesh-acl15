Title: Hoover makes one heck of a vacuum !
Content:
This vacuum works GREAT, lots of power to clean,and it sure will, and I really like the power hand tool to do stairs and upolstry . The only "bad" thing is the dirt container is small, because you will not beleive how much this vac will actually pick up ! But it is very easy to empty it out. This vac is Well worth the money !!

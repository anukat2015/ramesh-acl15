Title: I love my little power house sweeper
Content:
Having used my Hoover Sweeper over a month, I am more amd more pleased with its performance and ease of use. I bought it to use on hardwood floors , upholstery and carpeted stairs; however, I am using it on carpet and area rugs as well. It has exceptional suction which is so helpful because we are  home remoldeling and plaster and saw dust are every where. The dust and dirt are thrown away after each use. I wash the plastic receptacle and dry it. This may be an extra step that busy working moms may find disagreeable, but I like to do it because I know that I'll always start out with a clean , fresh vacuum cleaner.

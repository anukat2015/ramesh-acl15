Title: Satisfied Coffee Drinker
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker this past December and couldn't be happier. I use my coffee maker every day and picked this one because of the brand, Cuisinart, thinking that if I purchased a top quality brand I'd get a better cup of coffee and I did.  The coffee comes out piping hot, which is how I like it! Many of the coffee makers I've used in the past didn't brew a hot cup of coffee and didn't keep it hot after it was brewed.  It also has other great features like the adjustable hot plate, auto shut-off and programmable start time! I would highly recommend this to all serious coffee drinkers!

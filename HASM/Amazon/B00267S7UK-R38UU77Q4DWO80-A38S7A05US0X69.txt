Title: Beyond all expectations!
Content:
I've been an amateur photographer for almost 20years and the D90 was well worth waiting for.  I wont go into all the reasons I love the DSLR features, like ease of use, versatility and thoughtfully laid out menu and camera buttons.  Those have been well detailed in other reviews.  Its easy to say that the HD video feature is a just a gimmick.  After all I have yet to see a really good still camera built into a reasonably priced video camera.  But as it turns out the visual quality of the videos are amazing and to me have an almost nostalgic feel to them.  Especially when shooting wide open with an f/2.8 or faster lens.  The videos of my 2 yo twins that have been spontaneously recorded will be treasured more than any of the videos done on our traditional HD video camera.  I dont know if just having the camera on hand more often leads to more opportunities to shoot candid moments, but from the day I took it out of the box we have recorded some great moments that we'll cherish forever.  If there is one camera to own this is it!

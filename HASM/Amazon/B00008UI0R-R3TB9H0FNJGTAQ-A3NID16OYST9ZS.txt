Title: after 1 year and repeated repairs, buying a new vacuum
Content:
I highly advise against purchasing this product. 
We bought this vacuum because of all the positive reviews. And at first we were very happy with it, but practically every time we use it, the belt that turns the brushes in the floor unit slides off the track and it needs to be taken apart and repositioned. Over and over. After taking it to a Hoover service location we hoped it would be fixed for good. No such luck, it's just poorly designed in this respect.

Title: Great "little" coffee maker!
Content:
I've owned this machine for a bit over a year.  I didn't make much coffee until my girlfriend moved in. It's been brewing 1-2 pots a day for the past 9 months now.  When she first tasted the coffee that came out of it (I also use a Braun burr mill grinder), she was amazed.  Better than you can buy at most restaurants.  So, it's saved me a lot of money by just making great coffee here at home.  Slow?  Yes, a bit.  But that's because the water has to stay in contact with the grounds for a while to extract the flavor.  I have a couple of complaints about the coffee maker, however.  The hole to pour the water in is rather small, but once you develop a bit of patience with it and have a paper towel to sop up the little water that my not have hit the hole, it's not bad.  The next is a good feature, but I do get a little careless at times.  The carafe fits tightly on the warming plate and if it's not placed in correctly while brewing, the brewing coffee can spill over the edge of the filter basket when it fills up.  That makes for quite a mess.  But I've only done that twice and the last time was about 6 month ago.  Now I check it if I'm going to pour a cup before it's done brewing.  The tight fit is a nice feature because you know the carafe is place properly and won't leak, but you can't be so lazy as to not make sure it's seated right.  So I've learned.  But I'd buy this one again, and recommend it to friends.

Title: Simply amazing! Why buy a 30D?
Content:
I've had my XTi for a week now, having upgraded from an old D30. Wow! What a difference! The speed, accuracy, elegant user interface, are top notch. My bro' has a 20D, and that thing is a tank compared to the Rebel, which is amazingly compact. Feature-wise, the XTi matches or beats out the 30D in every respect except burst frame rate (3 vs. 5 FPS) which shouldn't matter. You'll take more pictures if you don't have to lug around a brick. A recommendation: ditch the kit lens, which is not worthy of this body and get an EF-L 17-40 or the EF-S IS 17-55, which most certainly are worthy. 
My one question to Canon: why don't you put a movie mode in your SLRs? I know it doesn't appeal to photo snobs but it sure is nice if you have kids.

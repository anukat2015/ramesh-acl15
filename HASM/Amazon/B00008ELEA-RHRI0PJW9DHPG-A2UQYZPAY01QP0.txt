Title: This is the best percolator....
Content:
Not only does it make great coffee, it makes it super fast and scalding hot!  One thing you may not know about the Farberware Millennium Percolators is after the unit stops perking, it switches to warm and then switches OFF after 2 hours.  I love this easy to use, easy to clean coffee maker.  It's light weight, compact and ALL stainless steel components....LOVE IT!!!

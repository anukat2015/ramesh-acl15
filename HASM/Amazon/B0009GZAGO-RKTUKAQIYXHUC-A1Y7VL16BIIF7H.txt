Title: D50 Rocks
Content:
Nikon D50 is an absolutely fantastic camera.
If you are moving from point and Shoot, you will jump to a completely new leage of photography.
Pros:
1. Noise extremely low at ISO 800, and highly usable at 1600.
2. Camera control is good, you get 2.5 frame per second, more than enough for non-professionals.
3. Flash sync is 1/500 sec, one of the best in market.
4. Image quality (IQ) is excellent.
Cons:
1. LCD screen is small.
2. Top LCD has no back light.
3. No depth of field review button.

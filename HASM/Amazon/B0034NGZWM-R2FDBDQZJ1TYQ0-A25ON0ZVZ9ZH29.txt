Title: Great laptop for the price.
Content:
This is the most powerful laptop I have seen at this price point. This system is easily a match for high end gaming systems by alienware or voodoo pc, but at hundreds of dollars less.
Pros:
There are a plethora of ports on the laptop - 4 usb, 1 e-sata, 1 hdmi, and 1 firewire. Add the standard network jack and multi-card reader, and you can use almost any conceivable device on this.  
The display is gorgeous, with full 1080p resolution.
There is plenty of power out of the box. This machine was able to play Dragon Age, Champions Online, and City of Heroes at full 1920 x 1080 resolution with graphics sliders set to maximum with no slowdown.  
The power is not limited to gaming. I was able to run Word, Access, Excel, Visio, and several web browsers simultaneously with no slowdown in the applications.
The illuminated keyboard is a very nice touch, making it easier to use the system in low light.
Cons:
A machine this powerful generates a lot of heat. You will need a cooling mat of some kind.
The ROG logo and case art is cool looking, but it can be gauche in a business environment. 
The battery life is on the short side, but I had planned on using this plugged in anyway.
Bottom Line:
The G51JX-X3 is a steal for the price being offered. It is a powerful desktop replacement at a great price.

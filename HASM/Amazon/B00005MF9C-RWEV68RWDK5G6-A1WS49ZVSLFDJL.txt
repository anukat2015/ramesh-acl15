Title: EXTREEMELY POOR PRODUCT
Content:
The Black &amp; Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug is a 'potential' fire harzard &amp; should be removed from the market!  This unit, when plugged in and power button OFF, turns on, heating up, attempting to brew coffee (although there is no water in resevoir!  This could, in our opinion, start a fire if unattended!  When we attempted to make coffee (according to the manufacturer's instructions) the coffee grinds were everywhere!  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! (Black &amp; Decker stated they were &quot;UNAWARE&quot; of any 'PROBLEMS' with this product although we have read many reviews (after our purchase)to counter that statement!

Title: Zero for two
Content:
I have received two brewers and both have been defective.  The first worked about 3 days and then didn't complete the brew cycle, leaving about a half inch of water in the cup.  Keurig replaced it with little fuss.  The second brewer lasted about two weeks with a similar failure, but not quite the same.  The third unit is on it's way, but needless to say, I have wasted too much time on this problem already and this will be the last.

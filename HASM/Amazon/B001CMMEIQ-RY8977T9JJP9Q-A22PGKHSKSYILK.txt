Title: Good cooling - bad design
Content:
The unit cools well and it is quieter than some other portable units I have seen but it suffers from several design flaws that were not apparent before I bought the product.
First - there are no controls on the unit itself. Not even a power switch. Everything is controlled through the remote control.  So even if you're sitting near the unit you still have to find the remote to make any changes.  And if you lose the remote you can't even turn the unit on or off.
Second - the unit only has a few lights on the front and it can be difficult to tell which mode it is in. The remote shows the modes, but sometimes you hit a button on the remote and it does not register so the remote now thinks the unit is on fan mode while it is still on cool mode.
Third - the louvers that direct the airflow automatically oscillate up and down, not side to side, which makes no sense.  Side to side adjustment is manual.
Fourth - you can set the louvers to point a specific direction, but it constant forgets the up and down part and points the airflow at the ceiling. Be prepared to reset this every time you change modes on the unit.

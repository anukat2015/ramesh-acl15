Title: Just returned (crackling speakers, slow, etc.)
Content:
I rarely write reviews, but wanted to warn others who are considering buying this laptop based on, for example, the recommendation that appeared in the New York Times. I just returned the laptop (and may have to pay a 15% restocking fee? so keep that in mind) because it's defective in at least three ways:
1) The speakers make a loud crackling noise.
2) The speakers sometimes stop working until you restart the computer.
3) There is something wrong with the computer generally that causes it to play online video and DVDs as though you are watching a slide-show, with a new frame arriving every half-second or so.
It's possible that if I kept this computer, I might find some way to fix all of these problems. But I doubt it -- especially the crackling speakers. And apparently Acer laptop speakers are a recurring problem: start typing "Acer speakers" on Google, and "Acer speakers crackling" is one of the first results.
Also, as you'll find other critics saying online, the laptop does come cluttered with a bunch of unwanted software (a program for eBay on the desktop? why?).
This is sad, but I may end up buying a Mac. I dislike the idea of being locked into whatever constraints Apple chooses to impose on its customers. But at least the software and the hardware will work together, and work well.

Title: Don't buy this...you'll be sorry.
Content:
We've had this vacuum for 2 years and I hate it. I was relieved to read some of these reviews to see that I'm not the only one. It does pick up a lot of pet hair, but other debris just flies around. If the filter clogs (which it does frequently) then the vacuum will not work. Sure, you could clean it out, only to find that it'll clog up again in 5 minutes. Emptying the container is gross and stuff flies around everywhere. I think I'll go back to a vacuum that has a bag. I hate this vacuum and I want a new one.

Title: So far, so good..   priced right
Content:
ok,  have only had this laptop 3 days.  NO problems out of box...so far I do love the Win 7.  Love the internet functions, wireless and not having all those IE boxes on the bottom task bar.      This computer seems like a speed demon compared to my old laptop.  Great for farming...lol.     I do wish the keyboard was centered..due to the number pad, the keyboard and touchpad are off center.  Need a bit of time to get used to this.  Also, the keys are very dark..wish it had a back lit keyboard, glow in the dark or bright  numbers on the keys.  if you type at night, aaarghhh.  I'm ok with letters, but the numbers are killing me.  Also, the delete and insert keys are in odd place.   Wide screen- very nice!     No camera or microphone, which I knew about when I purchased.  Everything else is as  stated on the description of the product. Have not tried to hook up to TV yet, but see the connections for tv and the card reader for camera.  The seller  does not provide tracking info which upset me at first.  I did get a notice from amazon the item shipped the very next morning after I ordered it, paid the basic rate and it did get here in the time specified...I just could not track it.   So far, so good.   would purchase again for the price!

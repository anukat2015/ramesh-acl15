Title: The D50 is a great entry in to dSLR cameras
Content:
This is my first digital SLR camera and I'm very pleased with it.  The photos are terrific, the controls are mostly easy to learn and quick to access.  My kit came with a 28-80mm lens instead of the standard 18-55, however.  The battery lasts a long time and the screen is bright.  Downsides:  The LCD panel on top isn't back lit so if it's really dark you won't be able to see it.  Also, the buttons you have to press to zoom in on a picture you just shot is kind of cumbersome.  Other than that, I've shot over 800 photos with it so far and I'm in camera heaven.

Title: What's the problem?
Content:
I don't understand the bad reviews for this product. I asked my wife to get a non-glass coffemaker because I am tired of breaking the glass coffee carafe when I wash it. I always end up buying a new coffeemaker because the price difference is close enough between a replacement carafe and brand new machine to opt for the latter. Coffee tastes good, coffee kept hot, easy to understand instructions. The arrows on the lid let you know where to position the lid for pouring and closing. Maybe if I needed a coffee pot that lasted over four hours this would be a bad deal, but all I need is for it to last maximum 2 hours, long enough for morning coffee with my wife on weekends and quick cup out the door before work days. I am confused by the negative reviews. Just make sure the lid is closed between coffee pours. No problem with cleaning, just wash in warm dish water. Also I followed the direction and ran clear water through before first use.

Title: great buy
Content:
This was a great buy. very reasonable for the quality. Easy to use. I had an upright and it was just too heavy for me to push around. Canister style is so much easier to use on stairs (has a little attachment for the stairs) and under furniture. Easy to get wand off of the motorized floor brush part. Canisters I had in the past were hard to get apart. This vacuum works great on bare floors as well as on carpet. highly recommend. I almost bought a much more expensive (more than 2x the price of this one) brand until I read the reviews on this product.

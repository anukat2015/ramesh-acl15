Title: E-330 remarkably able camera - high quality output
Content:
I have owned my E330  for six months, and I am more impressed all the time.  Its best features:
1.  Excellent photographic output, especially when set on ISO100 and shooting RAW.  The colors are very natural, not garish and overdone as on some other DSLRs.
2.  The hinged viewfinder is great because you can place the camera on low platforms or other odd places and easily compose.
3.  Live view is also a great composition tool.  On a tripod, Live View B lets you use the camera like a mini view camera. 
4.  With an adapter, you can mount hundreds of older manual focus lenses, and live view B lets you focus precisely. 
One hint:  skip the 14-45 mm lens.  It was a bit too compromised.  Spend more and buy the 14-54 instead.  However, the old version of the 40-150 lens is very nice, and an incredible bargain at the current price of about $100.

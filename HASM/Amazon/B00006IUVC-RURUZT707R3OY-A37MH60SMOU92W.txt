Title: $20 a year for coffee
Content:
I am rating this higher than I normally would because of all the unfairly low ratings I see here.  This machine is far from perfect, but for the price I don't expect much other than it work.
Let me caveat that almost all of the negatives written are true, but they need to be taken in perspective.  We have owned 3 of these and are in the process of looking for a replacement.  I will probably end up with a 4th for the lack of anything better that has the features we like.  These are the negatives that I have personally experienced:
Poor Quality Control - (why I buy these locally and keep the receipts)
Dribbling - Absolutely, it takes practice to pour without spilling, but it can be done
Short life - ditto, I have decided to consider these disposables with a 1 year working life
Other than those foibles these have worked well for us, and by the way, the comment about B&D Coffeemakers rating poorly with Consumer Reports is not true (at least with any current report I have been able to find).
My main reasons for buying (and re-buying these)
Cheap (good since I plan on throwing one away every 12-18 months)
Replacement Brewing Baskets and Carafes (I save these from the discards each year)
Auto Shut-off (THIS IS CRITICAL FOR ME, we have friends who lost their house to a coffee maker fire)

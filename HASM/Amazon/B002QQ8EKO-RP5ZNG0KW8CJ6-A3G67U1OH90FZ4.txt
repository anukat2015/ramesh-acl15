Title: First Mac Ever! Best Operating System Ever!
Content:
This laptop should be a great choice for anyone young and old alike. Easy to use and stunning display made it a easy choice for me. They talk this laptop up and they definitely should. It is everything they say it is. I am actually using it now. I was skeptical about the seven hour battery but it is true. The only con is there no SD card slot, but hey i'm not paying an extra $300 for the pro, just for it. I can always get a usb SD slot for cheap. But yeah definitely a great laptop. I've used Windows up until this laptop and I will never go back. Mac is an all around great operating system with everything you need and could want. And best of all Mac can't get viruses, we all no Windows can...

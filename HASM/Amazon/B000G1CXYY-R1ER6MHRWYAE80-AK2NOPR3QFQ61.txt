Title: Good for small space
Content:
Pros:  This is good for small space.  The heat it produce is strong.  Small size (durable).
Cons:  The thermostat does not work well.  Do not leave this unattended, because it will keep running without switching off even if the area is way too warm.  A bit noisy.

Title: Electrolux Sanitare Commercial Canister Vac
Content:
This is a great vacuum.  I just ordered a 2nd one for my parents house.  Light weight & cleans both smooth floors (mine are ceramic tile) and carpet.  Long hose and cord make the vac easy to use everywhere including stairs.  My Amazon order was filled by The Factory Depot and arrived in 2 days.  I spent a couple of dollars more for the 2nd one so I could order again from The Factory Depot.  Second vac arrived the next day after I ordered it.  Thanks to everyone for the excellent reviews about this product.  I always read all reviews before deciding on buying anything.

Title: Wonderful Hot Chocolate
Content:
I first heard of the Cocoa-Latte Maker in a Good Housekeeping article on our local news.  I am very pleased with it!  I have a soy allergy and cannot used hot chocolate mixes.  This appliance allows me to make a creamy smooth cup of hot chocolate in about 3 minutes.  I have also used it to reheat a cup of tea that had gone cold and had a 'tea latte'-- very good!

Title: Better than IPod, but still quirky...
Content:
Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the Zune 30gb.  I've always sworn I'd never buy an IPod because I despise Macintosh and more importantly I HATE using ITunes.  
Pros:
- pretty user-friendly interface
- the Zune software outdoes ITunes ten fold.  It's very slick.
- has an FM radio that works really well.  
- podcast functionality is just wonderful for me. It saves your spot automatically when you leave it.
Cons:
- Syncing can be quirky.  I have to place the cord in just the right spot and hold it there to connect.
- It's very sensitive to static.  Sometimes when I get out of my car it will reset.
- You can't create playlists on the fly.  You have to create them in the Zune software and then sync them.
Again, I'm pretty satisified.  It's not perfect, but it is the alternative to an IPod.

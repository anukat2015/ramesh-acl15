Title: Good if you like very small cups of coffee
Content:
The coffee is very good if you like a 6 oz cup, otherwise it is dish water.  Inorder to use this I have to brew 2 K-cups to make one decent but still part full mug of coffee.  This seems to be the main problem with all the single serve machines.  They make coffee in portions that are smaller than what most people drink.

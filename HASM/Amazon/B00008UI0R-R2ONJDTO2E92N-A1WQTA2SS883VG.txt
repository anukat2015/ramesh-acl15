Title: Has one potentially serious design flaw
Content:
I've got two problems with this vacuum:  1)  It doesn't work well on short-pile carpet (berber, or commercial weave).  The power brush stalls and throws off the belt.  2) There's a slot on the tube that allows the long extension arm to lock to the grip.  When using the attachments (crevice tool, upholstery brush, smaller power head), this slot allows small pieces of vacuumed material to shoot out of this slot, and directly into your face.  You could cover this slot with tape to block the opening, but the next time you attach the extension arm, you'll need to remove the tape to lock the arm.  This slot could have been positioned on the bottom instead of the top of the handle, but as it is currently manufactured, my advice is to ALWAYS WEAR EYE PROTECTION when using the smaller attachments.
I think the vacuum performs adequately otherwise -- it's easy to clean, easy to carry, and does a nice job on plush carpet and upholstery.  I have a Panasonic upright that I'll continue to use on the short-napped carpet.  So I guess I'm STILL looking for the one vacuum that'll do it all.

Title: I feel like I'm Madonna when I use this thing!
Content:
I got the B60 from a competitor of Amazon, but I'm here to buy all my K cups!
What can I say? This machine has changed my life. Not only does it make great coffee using the K cups (we like really rich coffee and so get the dark roasts and extra bolds), I'm more likely to make herb teas with it during the day and I use it for dispensing hot water all the time for reconstituting foods I've dehydrated.
Yeah, it makes a noise when it's priming, but not for long and not louder than our rather quiet dishwasher, for sure. Would it have been worth spending an extra hundred bucks for the quieter B70? I don't think so...but that's me.
The herb teas? I've got a My K Cup that I pop in after we're done with the morning coffee and DH's off for work. I leave it in all day, sans filter, and just tuck in a tea bag or two to brew tea. It works just fine for my tastes. At night, before I go to bed, I refill the B60's water reservoir and pop out the My K Cup and put the K Cup holder back in. Then my DH can stagger in and make coffee without having to wake me up! BLISS!
Did I mention you can make a cup of coffee or tea with one hand? When I'm talking to my sister in one of our marathon weekend catch-up conversations, I can make tea or coffee or whatever without having to say "Hang on a minute...I have to lay the phone down."
Priceless....

Title: very happy ipod owner
Content:
I used to own an old-school ipod mini (4gb).  I love my new 80 gig ipod.  I loaded it up with 2,000 songs, 100's of pictures and 5 movies.  It barely put a dent in the memory space.  I took it on vacation and was able to watch movies on the plane and enjoy a slide show of my pics as listened to tunes poolside.

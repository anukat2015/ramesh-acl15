Title: Great Ubuntu Linux platform
Content:
I have a slightly different model, the 1410-2936, which has a more powerful dual-core Celeron SU2300 ultra-low-voltage CPU and a 160-gig hard drive. There are several variations of the 1410 around the $400 price point with varying combinations of CPU, hard drive, and RAM, but the rest of the computer is identical. Read the specs carefully before you make your choice.
I've installed Ubuntu on dozens of laptops and desktops in the last couple of years. Laptops can be problematic because of hardware oddities, but the Acer 1410 is an ideal, pain-free Ubuntu Linux platform.
I didn't even boot Windows 7 -- I inserted a 2-gig USB thumb drive containing the Ubuntu 9.10 installation image, and about 17-18 minutes later I was up and running with Karmic Koala installed on the hard drive. 
It's blazingly fast, especially when compared with my daughter's Atom-powered Aspire One. With one exception, everything worked, slick and fast, right out of the gate -- webcam, multi-card reader, USB, touchpad, display, wireless and wired networking, etc.
The one exception was the internal microphone. A bit of Googling revealed a one-line command (sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic) that fixed the microphone for everything except Skype. Then, once I unchecked Skype's option to automatically set volume levels, the microphone started working, too.
The 11.6 size is a great compromise between the portability of a netbook and the usability of a notebook. The keys are full-size and the layout is sane. The screen is very, very sharp and the 1366-pixel display is wide enough for real work with multiple apps. Video performance is very good, handling Hulu's Flash video quite well.
The smaller Atom-powered netbooks win the cuteness contest and can have longer battery life, but I think the 1410 is a much more practical package, and the best value for the price I've found anywhere.

Title: Nice Small Spot Heater
Content:
This heater is a nice size for personal use at home or work. It is very quiet, which is a big plus for me. I like that it heats consistently without being overwhelming unlike some small space heaters that are too hot in a small, confined space.  It works best when nearby, say within a few feet. This unit is better on a surface than on the floor because the heat seems to be directed straight out, rather than in all directions. (I give it 3 stars instead of 4 because of this.) I use it at work, under my desk which is near a window, and it serves my needs quite well.

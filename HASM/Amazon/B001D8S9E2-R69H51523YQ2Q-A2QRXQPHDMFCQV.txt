Title: Nice Machine but Expensive and Some Flaws; Caution for Windows Migrants
Content:
Having used several Windows notebooks over the years - ThinkPad, Compaq, Dell, Toshiba, Sony VAIO - this is my first Apple notebook. Although, I have lusted after Mac OS for years, it wasn't practical because most of my work software is Windows. Now, the ability to run Windows on Mac notebooks has changed that and it is possible to have the best of both worlds. Amongst the Windows notebooks, ThinkPad has always been my favorite, and this MacBook is replacing ThinkPad X31.
MacBook is fast, feels very solid and sturdy, thin and has bright LED display with vivid colors and fast graphics. Some people are complaining about the glossy screen; but I found glare a problem only with bright light facing the screen. Battery life is decent, about 4 hours. Self adjusting screen brightness, depending upon ambient light, does not work very well and I had to turn it off. Backlit keyboard is excellent. You will like large multi-touch track pad after you get used to it. Two finger scrolling and right click are very convenient. In lot of ways Mac OS is superior than Windows, and especially Vista. Mac OS applications are lot more fun and easier to use, not to mention less crashes, freezes and viruses and malware.
Being a migrant from Windows, I miss dedicated PgDn and PgUp keys; it also lacks numLk, Home, End, and Del (forward) keys. Lack of Firewire can be a problem if you do not have another computer with one and need to use it for camcorder etc. Card reader is also absent and it is not easy to transfer camera pictures unless the camera also works as a card reader. Neither is there an express card slot or 3G modem. Cost is definitely a lot more than similarly equipped Windows notebooks. Mac versions of Quicken, Quickbooks, Dragon speech and several others programs are not as good as Windows versions which I have been using under Windows and Fusion. Theoretically you can use Windows on the MacBook but in practice many files saved in one operating system cannot be opened by the other operating system. For example, Windows cannot open many of my photos, documents and spreadsheets saved in MacBook ("Disk read error"). Potential Windows migrants really ought to look before they leap into the Mac OS.
I feel the ideal weight for a truly mobile computer should be 2-3 lbs and screen 12 inches. 13.3 inch screen has a big footprint and 4.5 lbs is slightly heavy. MacBook Air is not as powerful, is expensive, has smaller hard drive and lacks ports. And the main reason to get MacBook Pro is if you need firewire port and do lot of graphics intensive work. I loved my ThinkPad X31 with 12.4 inch screen, 3 lb weight and all the ports. For me the ideal computer would have been a ThinkPad X200 with Mac OS; I figured that in absence of that, this MacBook could be the next best choice. But so far, I have mixed feelings about trading ThinkPad for MacBook.

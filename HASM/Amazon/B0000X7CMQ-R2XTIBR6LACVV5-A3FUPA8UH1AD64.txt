Title: Weak Coffee Problem
Content:
There are Quality control problems with this maker. The coffee made started off medium strength (at best) and is now rapidly moving towards brown water. I have had the maker ~ 1 week. The filters don't fit the basket and the carafe has a weird slow pour spout that is irritating. Apparently they are not made in Japan. It will be returned. Pass on this.

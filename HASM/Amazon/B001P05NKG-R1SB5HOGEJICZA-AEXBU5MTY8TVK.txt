Title: A Wonderful Laptop
Content:
So we recently received our new MacBook Pro 13.3" laptop. It is a HUGE upgrade over our older white iBook. I purchased the laptop from Apple.com and received it within two days with free shipping. The laptop was up and running in less than an hour, with all our data brought over within a few hours. We could not be happier with it. The speed is wonderful, the display is bright and crisp, the backlit keyboard is a nice touch and the overall design is simply stated: beautiful. If you are in the market for a new laptop or unsure if a Mac is the right fit for you, I definitely recommend this new offering.

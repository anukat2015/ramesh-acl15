Title: sleek design, huge capacity
Content:
Overall I am very happy with this ipod.  It is my first mp3 player, so there is no basis for comparison.  But I don't know what I would change.  Sometimes the song changes but the display doesn't update to the new song.  Hitting the forward button brings up the new song information.  Otherwise it works great, and I don't imagine running out of space any time soon.

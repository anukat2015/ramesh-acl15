Title: Terrific Vacuum. Money well spent
Content:
I've been a Kenmore canister lover since the mid 1970's. My first one lasted 15 years which is why I kept buying them. Over the years, they seem to last less and less time. I just bought one last week and after 1 spin around the house, I decided to take it back. I wasn't planning on a Dyson, nor was I planning to spend $500 but after the demonstration and hearing the 5 year warranty, I took it home. WOW!!! I've NEVER had a vaccum that works this well. It's easy to manuever, fits under low clearance, quiet, and best of all, picked up my white cats fur in one swoop. OK, so $500 is a bit of cash for a vacuum, but I spent $350 on the Kenmore. For another $150.... I get to enjoy vacuuming. 
Well worth it folks. Go get one!

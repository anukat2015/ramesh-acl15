Title: Great Tool for Running and Listening to Music
Content:
My wife bought this for me as a Christmas gift.  I'm fairly new to running and I wanted to use Nike's product (Nike +) to analyze my runs.  The iPod did not disappoint!  I would recommend it for running, listening, and the iTunes library.  I'm sure I'll discover more ways to use the iPod in the future, but for now it does exactly what I want it to.
The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was due to the sensitive volume and navigation tools.  It would be better for me if the iPod didn't require such a sensitive touch.

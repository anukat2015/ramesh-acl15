Title: proven performer
Content:
a lot of photojournalists have this, and its easy to see why: fast shutter speed and af, good ergonomics, many lens options, nikon quality. at 6 mp, d70 proves megapixels arent the be-all and end all, it's what you do with 'em. kit lens is sharp, too. 
but i'd still want to go with the newer and better d80 if you can afford it, maybe even the d40 if you can't. the d70 is a great camera which had its place in the sun, but is now obsolete. still, if you're upgrading from a P&S, this will seem like a godsend. if you're lucky, you can scoop it up on closeout and save even more.

Title: Works great
Content:
I use this as a space heater in a 10 x  10 room and it works great. The comfort button works as designed. The heater takes a bit to warm up. It doesn't blast you with furnace like heat but it does put out moderately comfortable warmth. I would recommend it for smaller spaces.

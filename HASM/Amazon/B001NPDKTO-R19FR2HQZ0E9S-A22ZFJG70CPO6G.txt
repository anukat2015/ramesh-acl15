Title: Avoid HP, worst service and warranty support in existance
Content:
Laptop was received with a broken ethernet port.  HP would not service my laptop due to "customer related damage" which it was obviously not.  There is a reason they are dead last in all customer service polls.  God forbid if you need actually service.  Between dealing with people in India, which most barely speak English, and zero warranty support, take your money elsewhere.  HP is the worst service experience I have ever had.

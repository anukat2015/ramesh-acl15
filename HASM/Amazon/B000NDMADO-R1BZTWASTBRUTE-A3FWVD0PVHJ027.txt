Title: Very Disappointed :(
Content:
I purchased a Dyson Stowaway Canister Vacuum. It's not really all that it is cracked up to be, and you are pretty much just paying for the name. The suction isn't the greatest. I find myself repeatedly going over areas several times to collect up all of the dirt. It works great on carpets, but on hardwood floor and ceramic tile, it's useless! Yes, it's pretty, and yes, the no-bag feature is a bonus, but overall performance, it wont be on my Christmas list any more! Even the hose doesn't stay in place when you coil it up for storage and it's very awkward and heavy to carry.

Title: vacuum
Content:
This is a really nice and efficient vacuum cleaner. It picks up the dirt very well. The only complaint I have is that is fairly heavy for the design. It has a simple handle which lays down when not in use, but it doesn't drag very well, so it is logical to carry it and was obviously designed to be carried. I haven't used any of the attachments yet.

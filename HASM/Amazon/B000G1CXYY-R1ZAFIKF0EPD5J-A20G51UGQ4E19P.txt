Title: Great little heater
Content:
I bought this heater for my greenhouse in the Fall to keep it warm until I had to turn the gas furnace on.It kept it heated as good as the furnace. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked so well for being so small. I kept it at the low setting and that kept my electric bill within reason. Now my husband is using it in the basement since it is cool there all Winter. He also thinks it does a good job of heating. I recommend this heater!

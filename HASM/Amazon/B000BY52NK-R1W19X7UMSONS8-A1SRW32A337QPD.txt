Title: A better camera than you need.
Content:
I don't have much to say about this rig that Bjorn Roslett et al. haven't said better. I got it because I can use my old manual lenses on it; otherwise, I would likely have gone to the Canon system. If you convince yourself that this camera's what you need, you don't need to worry that you'll be disappointed.

Title: Six years and still going strong
Content:
LOVE IT! I bought this parabolic heater after using one at work and moving into a drafty apartment. We've had it and used it regularly for the past 6 years. I am unsure if others have a different model, but this one has a handle on the back as well as an "off" button that truly works (we unplug it for safety when going to bed though). The temperature settings are also drastically different. The whole family loves it, even the cats, who sprawl out in front of it even when it's not turned on! 
It takes just a moment of teamwork to position it correctly. If sitting together on a couch, for example, have your companion sit and instruct where to position it. If alone, just try to face it wherever you plan to sit. You don't even have to turn it on to figure out if it's in the right place, because it's pretty clear from how it looks where the heat will be directed. It's especially great for people like us, city-dwellers who live in small spaces. We typically don't end up using the central heat until January -- we just use the parabolic heater wherever we are in the apartment. The unit is also very light, so we often take it with us when we travel. 
The negatives are that the price seems to be climbing, although as I said, our model is still going strong after all this time. It was definitely worth the price and I will buy another when the time comes. Another negative is that (like most space heaters) you cannot sleep with it on, unless you can stand the heat coils lighting up and turning off every few moments. I took out the lightbulb in the base because it was not necessary for us, but I can see how it would be useful.

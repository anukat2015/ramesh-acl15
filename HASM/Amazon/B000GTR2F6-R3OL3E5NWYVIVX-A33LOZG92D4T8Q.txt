Title: Fantastic design, Fantastic coffee
Content:
I purchased the B70 coffee maker about 2 months ago because while my wife and I both like coffee, we rarely fixed it at home.  She drinks decaf, I like regular, and we are always rushing to get us or the kids ready.  So after paying too much for Starbucks for too long I wanted a coffee maker that was fast and we could each have what we wanted with very little prep time or clean up.  
I have just described the Keurig B70 perfectly, except I left off all kinds of accolades.  It is fast 35-40 seconds for a 10 oz mug, easy, no clean up, there are tons of flavors and types of coffee, and it makes a fantastic cup of coffee.  Before I bought it, I read some reviews that said it makes weak coffee.  The truth is just like any coffee maker, if you put in too much water, and not enough coffee, it will be weak, but there are so many varieties of coffee, you can get any stength that you like.  I personally fix a medium roast in the 10 oz size, but if I take a travel mug to work with me, I'll use a bold coffee in the 12 oz size.  
Not only does it make the perfect cup, it makes it consistently, and since the coffee is packed in air tight cups,  it is always fresh.  I think these single cup coffee machines are in a way kind of like Tivo when Tivo first came out.  Anyone who didn't own one, thought it was just like a basic VCR.  But once you used a Tivo, you would never switch back.  In five years this is how all coffee will be made, I am just glad I discovered it early.

Title: Loved it-But Plug Malfunctioning
Content:
I bought this for my son's room.  He's a baby, and therefore doesn't use blankets.  I have loved it as far as heating his room, very quiet, etc... HOWEVER... My father-in-law cautioned me (as do most loving parents) about unplugging it between uses.  I have started doing this the last two days, and today I noticed the plug was almost too hot to touch when unplugging it.  I examined the plug, and the metal has a charred look to it, like it was melting.  The plastic areas around the metal prongs is shiny and some small bubbles, like it was starting to melt.  I felt like I needed to come on here and caution anyone who has it to be careful and check your plugs... and for people looking to buy this to be careful too!  I had this in my infant son's room, so I am grateful I listened to my father-in-laws advice and started unplugging it, so I noticed the plug was going.  Because of this major hazard, I am giving the product 1 star.

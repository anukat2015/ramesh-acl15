Title: Not too impressed...
Content:
I've had this unit for almost a year, and there are things I like about it and things I don't like...
Pros: 
-good sound for the small size
-good price
-easy to use
-I like the clip; I can prop it up on my desk.
Cons:
-battery life is nowhere near 15 hrs
-when I do change the battery, it resets and I have to skip around to find the song I was listening to.
-putting it on shuffle or skipping through uses up the battery more.
I am planning on getting a SanDisk with a larger capacity; I am hoping it will work better for me.

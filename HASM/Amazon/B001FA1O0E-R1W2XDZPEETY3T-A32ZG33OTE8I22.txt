Title: big mistake
Content:
although i am sure that the item itself probably works fantastic but i bot this item last week and when i got it it doesnt even work i cant contact the seller to let them know or nething. now i have to take it into the apple store to get it fixed, hopefully, and i bot it brand new not used or ne thing like that but i opened it and it wont even turn on to work.. i would suggest no one buy it online just go to the store and pay the extra 10-20 dollars and get it brand new so at least then u will kno that it will actually work instead of hope it does and have to wait another month or so to even use it very dissapointed

Title: Hidden disaster
Content:
This portable air conditioner seems to be a dream, but in fact it is a disaster. The unit leaks water *badly*, as attested by most of the comments here and elsewhere on the Internet. You won't discover this immediately. If you run the unit occasionally, it may not collect enough water to be a problem. But if you use it on a regular basis, it *will* overflow, often with disastrous results.
Water, of course, is part of air conditioning. You can't cool air without water coming out, unless the air is absolutely dry. In-window units and central units simply pump or drop the water outside. 
An in-house portable unit has to get rid of the water somehow. I suspect that the DeLonghi unit is designed to remove the water along with the hot air it is pumping to the outside. Whatever way it's *supposed* to work, it doesn't handle the amount of water you'd get by running an A/C for several hours each day.
I discovered this the hard way, by finding my carpet soaked through to the wood beneath. It's going to take $600 or more to repair a 6' x 8' patch in my bedroom.
I haven't even bothered to contact DeLonghi. My experience is that most companies respond to disasters like this by running in the opposite direction. We shall see.
In any event, *do not buy this unit*.

Title: Wonderful Product
Content:
Simply put, glad I bought it. Very useful, fast, easy to use. Thankyou Mac, thankyou amazon for the tax free-ness. I really think this is the better value between the different options for macbook pro. I can't tell the difference between this and my room-mates who spent hundreds and hundreds more for the bigger screen and the bigger processor. (I kinda like the bigger screen but I'm still very happy I bought this one because of the much better deal)

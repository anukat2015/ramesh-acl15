Title: probably the last computer I will buy from Amazon
Content:
I ordered this on Black Friday in response to a good price for the specs (4GB RAM, 500GB disc) and paid extra for expedited shipping directly to my son in college, who needed to replace a broken PC.  It arrived on time but came with Hindi installed as the primary language, even in the trial package of Windows Office installed on the machine.  The laptop did not ship with a Windows 7 CD (and who knows what else is missing from the package).  This appears to have been a returned unit that was sold as a new product.  Amazon customer service response has been excellent so far and very generous, but if I had bought this from [...] we could just return it to the store.  Quite a hassle.

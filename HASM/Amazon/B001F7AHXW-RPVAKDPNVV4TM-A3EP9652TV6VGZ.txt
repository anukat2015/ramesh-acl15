This is my first iPOD.I have over 200 cd's and now they are all at my fingertips.It took me almost a week to transfer my discs to the iTunes library, but it was worth it.If you have alot of music this is your best bet.It's very easy to use, I would recommend it to anyone.My nine year old has the 8 gig Nano and loves it.

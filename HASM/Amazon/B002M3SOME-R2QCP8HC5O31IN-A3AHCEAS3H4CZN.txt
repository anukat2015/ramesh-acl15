Title: Good Starter I Pod
Content:
I got this as a Christmas gift from my Dad and I feel compelled to review it after several weeks of use.
Pros- The sound quality is excellent compared to music on a cell phone or anywhere else. The controls are easy to navigate when you are exercising and are low maintenance.  Battery life has not been a huge issue.
Cons- The headphones fall out with moderate exercise, particularly in the left ear. The lack of features (no video or screen) is a huge drawback. Apple headphones can hurt with extended use.
Overall- A good I Pod for light to moderate exercise or people just looking for music without the features. Will probably get a Touch or Nano in March but this Shuffle definitely has it's place.

Title: HP Pavillion Artist Edition...Great while it lasts.....!
Content:
My daughter bought this comp for college...worked great for a while...just out of warranty...had to completely reload operating system once... worked ok for while then the screen went strange colors and poof !! Hardware system error. Needs a new motherboard...not even 18 months old! Of course no warranty! Pissed! They want $400 for new one plus labor! I hate this disposable society we live in...What a waste! Sounds like she is not the only one with this trouble! Buyer Beware!

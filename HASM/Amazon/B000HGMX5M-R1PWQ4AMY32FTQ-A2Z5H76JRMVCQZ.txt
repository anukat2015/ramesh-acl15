Title: Great Digital SLR
Content:
This is my first digital camera, well, not really, I had a Sony Mavica 1.1 pixels, cerca 1999.
Previously, for serious work, I used a Canon film body with a Nikon CoolScan which scans 3000 dpi.
The D80 is my first "real" digital SLR and I am completely satisfied with its performance.
I consider myself to be a "semi-pro" and this camera fits perfectly (I like the hand grip and features much better than its' sister D40 & D70 models).

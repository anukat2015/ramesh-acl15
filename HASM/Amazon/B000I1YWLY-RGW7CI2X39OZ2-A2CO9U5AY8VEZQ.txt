Title: Overall very happy
Content:
This vac has great suction, does a beautiful job on carpets--so much better than my Dyson canister vac.  The only drawback is emptying the bin is very messy--the dyson wins on this one.  Attachments are nice quality, and the controls on the wand are great.  The filter cleaning feature is just okay--after cleaning the filters, they never quite look "clean", makes me wonder how long they will last.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.

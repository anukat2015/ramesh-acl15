Title: Great Notebook
Content:
I'm using this notebook as a desktop replacement and couldn't be happier. I've had this product less than 1 month, so I still have a lot to learn. There appears to be a lot of extra software that will not be necessary for my needs. The wide screen is bright and clear. I considered a larger notebook, but am pleased I went with the 16.4" instead; it's not too cumbersome for mobility, yet large enough to work with 2 windows side-by-side. One time, I contacted Sony for support, and they were excellent. Amazon and its supplier were outstanding in keeping me informed about my order, and it arrived earlier than I expected. The wireless capablilities are just one other feature I love. I couldn't be more pleased.

Title: DIRT DEVIL BAGLESS VACUUM 82500 REVIEW
Content:
During my 20 years in Real Estate Sales I have used many different brands of vacuums to tidy up. I have found that the Dirt Devil Cannister model 82500 provides the easiest solution to cleaning up. It is super light, easy to carry or roll and the motor provides great suction power. I also enjoy not having to shop everywhere looking for replacement bags as this is a contained canister model. More stores should carry this model at retail. It is only available online & many consumers are missing it in stores. It arrived promptly from Amazon.com

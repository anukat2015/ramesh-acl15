Title: I LOVE THIS IPOD!
Content:
Not only is this iPod small and adorable, I love everything about it!!! 
After reading many many reviews on the newest iPods, the 4th Gen Nanos - they really got mostly bad reviews. Plus I work with someone who bought one (she loved the purple) and had trouble with it the first week she had it - something about the stupid "Shake to Shuffle" - it was not consistent, either the slightest stir changed the song on her, or else she had to shake it really hard to change song. She really didn't want to take it back basically because she loved the Purple color! But on my convincing her that my 3rd Gen Nano was the best way to go, she took my advice - took it back to where she bought it, and came on Amazon to buy a Pink 3G nano (the store did not sell 3G's anymore!) Shame, since the 3 G's are far superior to the new 4th Gen ones.
Go with this product - you will be so happy you did (or wait until Apple comes out with a 5G!)

Title: iconic for good reason
Content:
When even Sony's very cool PSP comes out with white earpieces, you realize that Apple's iPod has since crossed that line separating iconic from just a hot fad.  Hands down, all other devices feel like they're trying to match, trying to be just-like, and in the end, give better testimony to just how good the iPod really is.

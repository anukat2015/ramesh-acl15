Title: Cheaply Constructed and doesn't deliver!
Content:
I spent over $200 for the item and it is a definite disappointment. The cheap plastic construction leads to parts that don't work. After moderate use, my infinity will no longer latch in the upright position. The finish rubs off with little use, and the unit clogs all the time. It is very hard to clean out, you almost need to break it down and completely clean the "guts" every time you use the vacuum. I would not recommend this product.

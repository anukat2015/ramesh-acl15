Title: Great at warming a chilly space
Content:
I've had this heater for two months for supplemental heat in an extra large bedroom where it sits in front of a drafty sliding glass door.  It works well for this purpose.  It does a great job knocking off the chill in a 10 x 12 foot area, which is the coldest area of the bedroom.  I don't have it set at the highest settings so it might work over a larger area.  The timer works well and is convenient.  Don't expect it to make you hot, but it's great at making a chilly area comfortable.

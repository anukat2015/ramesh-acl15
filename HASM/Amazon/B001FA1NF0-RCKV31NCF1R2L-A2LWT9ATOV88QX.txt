Title: One of the Best
Content:
It is a high performance mp3 player. Sound quality-excellent.
Easy to use and fun. Tasks well-chosen. Neat little package.
Just one thing. I have to use Funtack behind the right speaker 
to hold it in place. Works well and doesn't interfere with 
sound quality or comfort. Not Apple design problem. I have a
small right ear canal.

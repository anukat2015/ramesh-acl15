Title: Where's the heat?
Content:
Just got this thing and it barely gives off any heat. I got it because my old heater fan was going and thought it was neat this didn't have a fan but it can't even compare to my old heater that used half the wattage (and half the electric bill). Maybe if you had a tiny little bathroom this could do the trick but in my 10 x 10 office this thing does nothing unless you stand right next to it.

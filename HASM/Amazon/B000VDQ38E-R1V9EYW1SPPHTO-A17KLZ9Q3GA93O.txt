Title: Junk
Content:
Extremely disappointed in this vacuum. I dont mind that it is  heavy but it is hard to manuever. The on/off switch is in an awkward place, have to hold the cord up while vacumming otherwise you'll run it over. The cord has gotten so twisted it wont even straighten out anymore, which Ive never seen on a vacuum before. Clogs easy. Ive spent WAY too much of my time unclogging this hunk of junk. Every time I use it, it clogs. Filters are clean, thats not the issue. There is more hair clogged in the machine than gets in the cup. Filter needs constant cleaning. Suctioned great the first month or so, now not so much. Tube/wand slips out of position and until you realize it, youre not really vacuuming anything, then when you do you have to go back and vacuum again. Ive only had it a few months and Im ready to get something else. This is the 2nd Bissell Ive had and the 2nd disappointment. I'd never recommend this to anyone.  Ive written to Bissell and their solution was to either drive an hour away to have it serviced (its brand new!) or take the whole thing apart to see where its clogging and try to resolve the issue on my own!

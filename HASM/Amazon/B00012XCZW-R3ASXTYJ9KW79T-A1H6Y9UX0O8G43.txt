Title: GREAT FOR COFFEE LOVERS
Content:
I am very plesed with this coffee maker. It is very sleek looking and works great. Coffee is made before you can get your cups ready.. I have previously owned a BUNN many years ago and it lasted about 15 years.. I have always wanted another one but couldn't afford it.. This item was priced right and I am so happy.. It is very easy to operate. Water is kept hot so if you need hot water for something else you have it..It is also great for making tea.. I would highly recommend this model..

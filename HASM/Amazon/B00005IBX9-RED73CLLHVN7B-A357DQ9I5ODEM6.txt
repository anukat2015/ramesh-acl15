Title: Best Coffee Pot Ever
Content:
Before I bought this pot.. I came here and read the reviews..I was impressed.. but didnt believe them.. after my 8th cheap Mr. Coffee pot.. you know the $19.99 ones.. that leaked.. and spit coffee all over the counter.. I thought it was time to upgrade my Coffee pot.. besides the fact that its a nice looking maker.. it doesnt leak.. nor does it look like I even made coffee.. the warming plate is clean.. not a trace of nothing.. I like the beeping feature that lets you know when the coffee is done..
also.. I ordered this on a Monday afternoon.. free shipping.. and i got it the next day.. 5 stars from me

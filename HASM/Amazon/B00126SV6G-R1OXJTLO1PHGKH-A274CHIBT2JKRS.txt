Title: One excellent mp3
Content:
I didn't expect to get too much from the mp3 player but in the end it delivers in all areas pretty good. I like the setup for the menu and how simple it is... after a while to use it. The videos that you would upload comes in pretty crisp and fluent in is picture. I like the sound you receive from the Creative but you just have to get some better earphones as the earphones that come with it isn't really all that. Music is astounding to listen to and if you are looking for just a good MP3 PLAYER then this is what you want. It is no Ipod and to me is better than one for its price. Overall a good mp3 player. Can hold alot of songs for its gigabyte amount.

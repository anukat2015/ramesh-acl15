Title: Brew'n Mess would be more like it...........
Content:
I followed the directions carefully not to mention I've been making coffee for 40 years.  This design is very poor.  Directions say put sugar and cream in travel mug before brewing.  Okay what they don't tell you is forget about stirring because the cup and contents are so hot it's impossible to get the lid off w/o burning yourself and spilling coffee all over.  The first time I made coffee it worked like it should, the second time the coffee ran all over my counter top.  Have no idea why, I took the same steps.  I do not recommend this item at all and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.

Title: Awkward and annoying
Content:
I've had this coffee maker for 6 months now. I can't recommend it. Why?
There are so many awkward things about it. 
1) The basket is not easy to seat. You have to continually turn it until it finds its right place.
2) If you don't seat the basket correctly, the water overflows in the basket and you have grounds and coffee all over the counter.
3) The carafe must be seated exactly. If it's a 16th of an inch off center the water again overflows and ditto to #1.
4) It's not easy to see the little red ball that indicates the water level. 
5) The carafe is awkward to pour. It spits and sputters whether full or almost empty. Ergonomically, it is the worst I've seen.  
6) Items 1 - 3 happen about once every two weeks; 4 & 5 happen every time. 
7) I recommend you look elsewhere. I preferred my Mr. Coffee for $15.

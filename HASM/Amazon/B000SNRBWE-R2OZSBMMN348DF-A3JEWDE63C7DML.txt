Title: same as kenmore at sears but more expensive
Content:
If I had done enough research before purchasing I'd buy the Kenmore at sears, this is exactly the same model as Kenmore (much lesser in price and has extra feature-performance indicator). 
Functionally, this is a good canister vacuum. good suction, easy to move around and under furnitures, handy on/off control at thumb, most importanly, not as heavy to push around like my old upright.  However, there is one part of the vacuum I don't think was well designed. The tab that holds the door to the bag chamber does not "click" when you close it, and I can easily open the door without even pulling the tab. That means the bag chamber could have lost suction power.
Luckily my in-law is very handy when comes to repair small appliance, so I decided to keep this machine. Otherwise, I might return this model and get a German made.

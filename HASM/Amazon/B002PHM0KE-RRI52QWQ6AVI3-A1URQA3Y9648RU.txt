Title: Looks fancy, but defective
Content:
This is great looking laptop, but has one significant defect. At the left side of the laptop, there's constant whirring sound which is quite anoying. I talked with Sony eSupport, but didn't get any help. So, I returned the first one, and exchanged with the second, but the noise was still there. Because of Amazon's return policy (85% partial refund), I have no choice but to keep this defective laptop. I wonder how Sony could make this kind of laptop.

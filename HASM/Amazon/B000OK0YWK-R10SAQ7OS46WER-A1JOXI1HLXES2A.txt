Title: Zune 30gb customer review off Amazon.com
Content:
The product (Zune 30gb red) i purchased off Amazon.com was ok...I opened the package and installed the software which no longer works on my computer due to some unknown difficulty with the master cd. Another thing, it came with a USB cord to plug into the computer and when i tried to use it... the two buttons on the side of the USB cord which plug into the Zune itself fell off completely...so whenever i want to disconnect the two i have to find some pliers or something to push into the USB adapter which will enventually disconnect. Im very disappointed that the master cd and the USB cord were defective..I hate to have to go to my friends house and use his computer on his time just to load my Zune.
Thanks

Title: Kruz is PERFECT for my needs
Content:
We recently had the entire first floor of our home tiled with ceramic and slate. We have several Pugs who shed constantly and the dog hair accumulates on the tile quite rapidly. I keep my lovely, yet sturdy, Kruz just inside my closet and whip it out each morning for a quick run over the tile to catch the newly shed fur. It picks it up perfectly and is so easy to empty. I really like the design and the easy glide little wheels that allow me to get into all the corners. The charge is good for at least a week then I pull out the charger and redo it when needed. I love this little gadget!

Title: The Dribler
Content:
Make sure you have a few paper towels and a mop handy.  The stream of coffee shoots out right on the edge of the cup.  If you don't have just the right angle on it, you are going to be cleaing up a huge mess.  Or in my case this morning you are going to be changing your work clothes with 5 minutes to spare because the peice of crap dribblied down the mug, all over the counter and subsequently all over my nice work slacks.  I hate this thing more than words can describe.  If it did not belong to my lovely girlfriend, I would take enormous pleasure smashing it to peices with a sledge hammer.  I would like to meet the designer so I can send him the bill for a couple of dry cleanings as well.

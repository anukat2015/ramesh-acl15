Title: Best Coffee Maker I've Owned -- Coffee Connoisseur
Content:
I thought it would be difficult to top my previous coffee maker, but the Cuisinart DCC-1200 has done just that! I'm amazed at the piping hot coffee in the smaller quantities (1-4 cups). The no-drip carafe is true! It's the first one that can pour slowly and quickly without a separate stream going down the pot or missing my cup entirely. The cone-shaped basket is ergonomically correct, meaning #4 paper cones expand to fit perfectly so there are no grounds in the brew. The only drawback for me is the step system water fill. The place where you pour the water into the machine has a series of steps starting at 12 and going down by two cups per level (10, 8, 6, 4, 2). The problem is that you'll have to lean over the entire machine while pouring water into it. It would have been much more effective to have an external gauge. My other alternative has been to measure the water in the carafe and then pour it into the water fill. It's minor, but it's a daily obstacle. Otherwise, best coffee maker I've owned, and I'm a coffee connoisseur!

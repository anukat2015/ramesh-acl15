Title: Poor design of spout.
Content:
We purchased this model to replace a 5 year old brewstation that was finally beginning to fail.  It looks sleeker, and has more features than the older model; however, there is a critical design flaw that renders it useless for us. The spout does not sit out far enough to fill our mugs without spilling coffee down the outside of the mug and making a huge mess.  This one will be going back to the store.  I had high hopes for this model, but now I am unsure how it even got past the design phase.

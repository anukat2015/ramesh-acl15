Title: Good but possible defect?
Content:
I just got my NANO last week and the minute I turned it on (before even transfering any music to it) I could hear a faint noise/buzz from the nano.  It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit.  Has anyone experienced this with theirs?  My first generation nano does not experience this noise.  I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement.
Just a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective.  Lesson learned for everyone else, if you don't have to get a new toy right when it comes out...wait...let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself!
UPDATE:  So I went to my nearby Apple store, put each Nano on display to my ears and 1 Nano in the entire store produced the same buzz sound as my unit.  I talked to the Apple tech person and he explained it was not a defect and that my nano was to spec.  He rationalized that essentially it is an electronic device and different nanos may behave slighty different.  He offered to exchange my brand new nano for another one but could not guarantee the replacement won't produce the same buzz.  Since I bought my nano through pcconnection.com, it could not be exchanged ultimately.  Oh well, kudos to him for even offering in the first place.  I've decided to live with my "buzzing" nano and am a happy camper.

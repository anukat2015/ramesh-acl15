Title: Useless machine - False promise by Toshiba
Content:
This is my 5th Laptop and 7th Computer in my life. I had previously owned two PC's - Dell and HP.
Laptops i owned are Acer - 4100, Lenovo 3000 N100, IBM ThinkPad T40, T60, T61, Apple Macbook Pro.
And this is my 50th Purchase from Amazon. 
I bought this Laptop after making a tough comparison with ASUS X5. This one as others mentioned have lot of -ves.
First let me list all the +ves.
1. Bright Screen.
2. Good battery life ( but in low feature as advised you can get max of 7 hrs).
3. Speaker sound is OK -after you make the adjustments as advised by others.
4. Laptop speed is an average.
5. Lightweight this is less than 4 Lbs as mentioned.
-ves'
1. Toshiba have an TV ad for T135 - saying this will start working in 10 secs after you just close the LID, but its not true. This takes atleast a minute to show the screen. I guess the processor is pretty slow or un responding.
2. Wifi Card - Atheros is the utter flop and everytime i have to manually right click on the bar and say Troubleshoot problems. - 0 Star.
3. Web Cam is the most ugliest i have ever seen - Lots of Grains and its not clear., have to do lot of adjustments to make it seeable. - 0 Star.
4. Key board is the major Flaw, in my case the Down arrow and the Left arrow keys got struck and times not working.,
Alt + Spacebar combination is un-recognizable. - 0 Star
5. Touch Pad is a major major Flaw and very much Annoying., because of this i am giving the least star., Amazon should allow 0 stars. One single bar for LEft and Right click is very tough and needs lots of pressure to use. - 0 Star
6.Though this laptop runs silently at times Laptop gets heated for no reason. You cannot keep it in your Lap on that heat.
 My sincere advise is please do not buy this Laptop and waste your time.
Amazon's customer service is pretty good as always. They sent me the return Lable to my mail ID today. So going to return this Laptop. These are my last words from the same Laptop.

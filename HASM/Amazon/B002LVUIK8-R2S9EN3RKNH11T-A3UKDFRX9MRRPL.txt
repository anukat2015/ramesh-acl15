Title: Pretty good coffee maker
Content:
Handsome design.  My only complaint is that it seems to require quite a bit of coffee in order to make a good-tasting cup.  It doesn't perk but rather, boils the water so that it runs over the grounds just once.  Maybe if it actually perked it would pick up more of the flavor and also give my kitchen that morning-coffee smell that I love.

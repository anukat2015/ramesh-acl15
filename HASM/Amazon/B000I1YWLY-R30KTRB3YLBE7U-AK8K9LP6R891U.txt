Title: Good for carpet...
Content:
I bought this vacuum as a replacement for my Hoover Wind Tunnel Upright. Although this vacuum does very well cleaning the carpets it is not as good on the non carpeted areas of the house. It has a switch to turn off the brushes for bare floors but the suction just isn't strong enough to clean well. The attachments that come with this vacuum are the small upholstry brush, a crevice tool, a small flat tool and a larger brush that might work on bare floors if it didn't have the brushes on the edge or the two small wheels on the side. Only 2 of them are able to store on the handle and one usually ends up popping off during vacuuming. This vacuum is also very loud when the beater bars are running....it sends both our dogs running for cover!! The dust bin is fairly easy to empty...as with all bagless vacuums this is best done outside the house. We have also found that taking an air gun to the dust bin removes any remaing dust (also do this outside). I have not had to self clean the HEPA filters yet and have had this vacuum since January 2007. All-in-all if I were to purchase another vacuum cleaner it would probably not be this one as I think there are other comparable vacuums with much smaller price tags.

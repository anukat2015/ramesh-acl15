Title: Don't bother purchasing this
Content:
I purchased this for my husband for Christmas 2009. He went to use it for the 2nd time last night (with the first time just making a recovery disc and setting up e-mail) and it went to a white screen, with no option to do anything. We rebooted by shutting it off and on because Control, alt, delete did nothing and it came back with vertical colored lines and no matter how many times we turn it on and off, it does the same thing. Probably less than 5 hours on this machine. Pretty much defective immediately. Now that it's been more than 14 days since we purchased it (Best Buy), we have to work through the warranty service, which means we'll probably have to send it off and wait a month. UGH!!  I've had my toshiba for 1.5 years with no issue, but this one is a bummer. Only problem we've consistenly had with our Toshibas involve replacing the power cords, a lot! Get the warranty, you'll use it. Everything is so expensive when it comes to repairs.

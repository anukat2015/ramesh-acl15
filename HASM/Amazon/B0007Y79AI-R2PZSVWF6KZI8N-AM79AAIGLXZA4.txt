Title: Verde Pod!
Content:
I love my green iPod!  Ohh!  After not caring about them since they were developed I finally has a change of heart, and I'm ever so happy with my choice!
**Make SURE you specify whether your iPod is compatable for Windows based computers or Mac computers.  A pod wired for a Mac computer will NOT work for a Windows computer and vice versa.**
The only minor issue is that the earbuds may not *stay* in your ears! However, nobody said that you had to use earbuds, but if you do, there is a newer earbud with fitted rubber ends, and if you don't like earbuds, you can still use regular headphones. I do. :D
The second issue is the USB wire.  Sometimes it may have to be giggled a little so that it can be read by your computer.  Or, just contact an apple store (which can be found in places like Circuit City, etc.) for a new one.
And just for protection, especially for those of you who participate in rigorous activity, a protective case might be good to own, and Apple care should also be bought by EVERYBODY just in case your "little green thing" acts quirky. ;)[...]

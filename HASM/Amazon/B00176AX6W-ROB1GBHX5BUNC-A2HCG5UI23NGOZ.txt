Title: Great Product!
Content:
I don't know what is all the fuzz with the new Zune... I got mine a week ago and everything is working fine... I got the software and everything is in order... all the albums, pictures, and movies are where it is suppose to be... and I have no problems at all with the software! 
The software is so good that it is my default player when I am listening to music in my computer! 
I got my Zune from the Zune website... there I added a design on the back for FREE!! You can even add your name with a design!!! All this for free! No extra charge! Even the shipping was free! And fast! 
I love my Zune I got no problems with it! 
I strongly recommend getting one! It is AWESOME!!!

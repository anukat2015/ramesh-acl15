Title: Loving this Macbook Pro So Far!
Content:
After decades in the PC World, this is my first experience with a MAC.  I received my 13" Macbook Pro a couple days back, and I'm loving it!  This computer is inherently easier to use, is super fast and looks and feels great!  So far, no technical difficulties-- it was very easy to set up.  The shipment arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I would definitely recommend buying this computer through Amazon.

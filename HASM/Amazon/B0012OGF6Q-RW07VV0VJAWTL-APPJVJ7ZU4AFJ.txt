Title: Great, but get the D40
Content:
This is a great camera, I spent a long time reading reviews about it online before purchasing.  After my purchase I started to research more about photography and Nikon, and I ran in to Ken Rockwell's (aka the Nikon Man) page.  Here is his conclusion on the D60:
"The Nikon D60 is a 'sucker' camera sold mostly to people who are not professional photographers, but who are impressed by meaningless megapixels. Megapixels have nothing to do with picture quality. The less expensive D40 is the same thing as the D60, but better. The D40 is the professional's vacation camera. It's what I take when I'm on vacation or with family, too.""
You can google "Ken Rockwell" for more info.  Imagine how I felt after reading this.  Nevertheless I enjoy my D60, and think its a very good camera for introduction to DSLR.

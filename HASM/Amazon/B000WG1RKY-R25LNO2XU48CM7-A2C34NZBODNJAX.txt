Title: Zune 8 GB Digital Media Player Pink (2nd Generation)
Content:
I love this Mp3 player! Sound quality is great and the screen quality is fantastic! The only thing is that i would like it to have the time and a calendar on it but i can live without it. I had a creative labs 2gb zen v that i really liked but it just stopped working one day about a year after i got it. So it took me a couple months to decide which i wanted next so i was going to get the 1 gen. 30 gig but i went with this one and im so happy i did! Its the perfect size and has just enough space on it. I would recommend this product to anyone. Oh and its very easy to use My friends daughter is 3 and she knew how to do everything with it she could turn it on and change the song and turn the volume up and down as well.

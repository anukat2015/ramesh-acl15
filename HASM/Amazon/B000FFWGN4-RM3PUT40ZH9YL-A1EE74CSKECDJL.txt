Title: Hate is too weak of a word
Content:
The first few weeks weren't too bad. Then the attachments started falling off the vacuum every time it was moved so...I just took them off. I don't have a long haired dog (I have a Boxer); I don't  have kids...it is just hubby and I...so my house is not uber dirty but every time I use the vacuum I have to stop and take a pair of scissors and cut the threads, hairs, strings...whatever..off of the brush or it doesn't move and the motor starts to get really hot. I have cleaned the filters---despite the indicator being green---in hopes of getting better suction---no luck. I vacuum and there is next to nothing in the dirt cup. It is somewhere but...where??????? Oh, and as for cleaning dog hair off of furniture? HA!! is my response... If there is anything to like it would be the fact that you can detach the main part of the vacuum cleaner and carry it easily to do things like stairs. Hey, it can't be ALL bad, right? I am looking for a new vacuum and this one is not even a year old. I have had it!

Title: Good Design, Bad Personal Experiece
Content:
Usual good Sony design. I was really happy with it at first, but it kept freezing up and now I have either a) malfunctioning motherboard or b) crashed hard drive. It's only been 25 days since I bought it. I know Sony has a good reputation so I don't know what to think now. Is this product genuinely bad, or was I just unlucky to buy a lemon?

Title: This is a great item!
Content:
I can't believe all the bad reviews. I love this cocoa maker, and so have my friends that use it. We take it camping and make cocoa for the kids. The kids love to watch it swirl/warm up and to be able to dispense their own drinks. I don't think it is hard to clean at all. Same concept as an electric blender. I fill it up with warm soapy water, wash it, then I open the dispenser and run the hot water out of it to keep it clean. Just wipe the base off. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because of the frothy mechnism. It doesn't work as well as I anticipated, but it serves it purpose well enough.

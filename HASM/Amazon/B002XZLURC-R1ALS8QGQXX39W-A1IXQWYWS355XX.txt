Title: Good laptop if you get it at $799 or less
Content:
This is a good laptop.  I am using it as a second laptop for portability.  If you are coming from a mac and used to it, there may be some gotchas.  Specifically, the trackpad is not all that good.  Also, the screen could be much better.  It has a very small viewing angle from which it looks good.  The HDMI is definitely nice.  It helped me to not buy a second computer as HTPC.  Maybe I will someday, but for now the laptop works.

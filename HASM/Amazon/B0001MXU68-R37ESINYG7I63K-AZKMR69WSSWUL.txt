Title: Leaky, Lots of Broken Pods, But Great Tea and Easy Cleanup
Content:
I got the Melitta because I live alone, and only ever want one cup.  The coffee is OK, and I like the fact that I don't have to clean a carafe.  The tea is actually better than the coffee, particularly the raspberry.  Problems: The pods are hard to find in stores, or at least, the varieties are hard to find. Do NOT try to use another brand's pods--they don't fit and make a mess.  My first box of pods also had 4 duds out of 18, that is, pods that had split seams with coffee leaking out.  The thing leaks all the time with coffee, less so with tea.  8 oz. is not a lot of coffee, so I frequently make 2 cups, which is a lot of money when you think of it--might as well buy a cup somewhere.  Finally, it makes a ridiculous amount of noise.  But I have to admit that my red one looks really cute, and it is very easy to clean, just take out the basket and spout and stick them under the faucet.

Title: Best machine I've ever owned.
Content:
I spent a lot of time researching which Coffemaker to purchase.  By reading others' comments, I was able to determine what features were important to me and which one satisfied those needs.  I have been using the Braun KF590 for a month now and am VERY pleased with my purchase.  I stopped using the filter basket almost immediately, and bought disposable cone filters and I may try it without the Braun water filter and see if I notice the difference.  Right now I'm getting a great cup of coffee every time.  No complaints whatsoever.

Title: Makes great coffee!
Content:
The coffee comes out at just the right temperature for me and brews
quickly. 
The flavor is great, and I love the convenience of having the 2 mugs.
I always hand wash my insulated travel mugs, so it is no problem to wash
the mugs by hand. The material of the mugs washes easily and
quickly. I like the "grip" areas on the mug, as it makes it easier for
me to hang on to the mug.
My only slight problem is the very small button to push to start
the coffee. With bad arthritis in my hands, it is a little hard for 
me to get that small button engaged. But that problem is minor, and
I would buy this coffeemaker again.

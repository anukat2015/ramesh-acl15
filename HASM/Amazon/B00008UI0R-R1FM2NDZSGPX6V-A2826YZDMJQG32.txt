Title: Finall HAPPY with a vacumn claener! HURRAY!
Content:
I read the other reviews, which were mostly good, so I decided to try it out. I got an awesome price with the holiday sales and got the vacumn super fast! It works GREAT and even works great with the attachment for the hardwood floors (the attachment is for any smooth flooring surface). Canister vacs always work better than uprights, but I hate pulling the canister around. The good thing, is I have stairs, so the canister is lightweight and I can carry it up the stairs while vacuming them with the stair attachment. This is impossible to do with an upright vac! The stair attachment works pretty good, but it seems to stall a little while I vacumn and I have to turn it off and on to get it going again. This may be due to my carpet though-it's super plush.  This vacumn does good on the carpet with the powerhead attachment, but as I said before, I do have super plush carpet, so some things get buried back in instead of picked up. It did a great job on the pine needles after I removed the christmas tree, but it clogged up fast and I had to clean it out. But I think that would happen to any vacumn. It was easy to take apart and clean out though. In the end, I am very happy with this vacumn and I'm glad I decided to buy it! :)

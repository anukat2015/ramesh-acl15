Title: perfect companion camera in daylight
Content:
This is a great camera to walk around town with. It doesn't have the image quality and low light performance of a high end model like Nikon, but if you are looking to take an SLR on a trip and don't want to run the risk of loosing your most expensive camera, this is a great model to pick up. 
A cool feature is it's swivel screen, which lets you see yourself or shoot from the waist.

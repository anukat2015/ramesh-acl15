Title: Excellent, if a little hard to maneuver
Content:
The most effective vacuum I've ever owned. But, then, my Kenmore canister, bought in 1966, likely will keep its title for longest running (and with no repairs other than duct tape) as it's still running. I've had the Hoover only a few weeks, but it is powerful, thorough in its pickup of everthing from cat hair to micro dust, and easy to operate. Like most canisters, it's a bit clunky to pull around -- and the weight that gives it substance makes that harder. Also, the one floor/rug head doesn't fit under some of my furniture. Still, these seem like minor problems in the trade-off for the good job it does. This model is bagless, which might not be an advantage -- cleaning the good-sized dirt cup and filter takes some time.

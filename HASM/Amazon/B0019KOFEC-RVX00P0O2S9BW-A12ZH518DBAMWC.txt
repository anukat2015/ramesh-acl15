Title: I had 20 Years Use out of My Last Eureka
Content:
...then it died.  If I'd ever bothered to service it, it probably would still be rolling. I loved it so much, I bought another one.  The power on the newer model was amazing.  At first I had trouble getting the wand to go in the direction I wanted it to go in, but after a while, I got the hang of it.  The pet hair attachment is just what I needed to keep my shaggy dog's coat from becoming a permanent slip cover on my sofa.  Here's to another 20 years of great service.

Title: It's what she wanted.
Content:
This Nano was a gift for my daughter for her 12th birthday. She's been begging me for months, since she lost her last Nano. I bought the Nano b/c there's a big price difference between the Nano's and the Video iPods BUT I personally do not like how small and light it is. It's very easy to lose. Other than that, it's great.

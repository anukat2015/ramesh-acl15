DO NOT BUY LASKO PRODUCTS!I HAD THIS MODEL FOR LITTLE LESS THAN 3 YEARS, USED IT IN LIVING ROOM DURING WINTER MONTHS ONLY. IN JAN 2010,THE UNIT STOPPED AND I GOT BURNING SMELL.
WHEN CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AT LASKO, THEY DO NOT FIX THIS, DO NOT HAVE PARTS FOR THIS. THERE IS A SPECIAL PART FOR RUNNING THE FAN AND THEY LASKO DOES NOT CARRY THEM. THE LADY AT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID-THROW IT AWAY, BUY NEW! I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY CUSTOMERS HAVE THESE LASKO PRODUCTS AND HOW LONG THEY HAVE WORKED, BUT I WILL NEVER BUY LASKO AGAIN AND NOBODY SHOULD! 
SHAME ON SUCH A MANUFACTURER!

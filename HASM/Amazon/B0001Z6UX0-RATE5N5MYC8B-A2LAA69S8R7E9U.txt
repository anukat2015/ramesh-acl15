Title: Your Retro Toaster, Supersized
Content:
This product works for smaller rooms, or, if you really want to use it in a mid to large room, you have to do some pre-heating because the passive warmth from this heater needs some time to spread itself. Good luck with that. And don't open any doors, either! Seriously, this is okay for a modest-sized space, but its effect in a bigger room is like a plug-in placebo at best: if there's a heater in sight, it can't be THAT cold. It really looks like a giant bread toaster (a very attractive one, though). And, to be honest, running it sometimes gives me nearly the same degree of worry I'd probably feel if I plugged in a toaster in the middle of a room and left it on for hours. As far as space heaters go, I'm much more impressed by robust, steadfast heat generated by oil-filled, radiator-style models.

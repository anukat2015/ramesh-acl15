Title: The best!!!
Content:
I purchased this vacuum when we moved to a new house..I had a central vac in my old house, and thought I would really miss it..however, I bought this Dirt Devil 082700..I couldn't be happier! It is so easy to use, great suction, and lightweight. Pulls easily with the large wheels, and stores in a very small space..automatic cord rewind...just couldn't ask for more!

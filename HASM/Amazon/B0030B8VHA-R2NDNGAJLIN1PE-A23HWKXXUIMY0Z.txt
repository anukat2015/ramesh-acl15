Title: PC version of a MacBook
Content:
When I first unboxed this, it was the first thing that came to mind. This is a PC version of an Apple MacBook. The extremely thin, and a very well built, solid feel to it. Not to mention the chicklet style keyboard. It SCREAMS MAC! It would have been really nice if the keys were backlit, but oh well. 
My first concern with this laptop was weather or not the 1.3 Pentium DC processor was going to get the job done running Windows 7. I am here to say that it does. In fact, it runs extremely well. All of the apps that I have pulled up, (admitedly none that would be considered 'heavy') have run with no lag, or problems what-so-ever. 
The trade off for the slower, dated Pentium Dual core processor, is that you get 8 FULL hours of usage time. It comes as advertised too. Infact, I have gotten closer to 9 hours of time out of mine on a full charge. 
The wireless antenna is extremely strong uses a technology called ConnectUp. Not quite sure what it is, but it rules! Have gotten a strong signal from all over my house, where my previous laptop would struggle.
The screen is a backlit LED display which is absolutely beautiful. The HDMI port is a nice add on, but I cant even imagine when I will ever hook it up to my TV, since the display on the laptop itself is so amazing.
The speakers are very good, and even get a little bit of the surround sound feel.
I would not recomend this computer to anyone that is looking for a hardcore gaming unit. Although I have not tested the processor out on a game, I would think that it would probably choke. But I am not a PC gamer, so it suits my needs just fine.
Well worth the $650 investment.

Title: A great gift
Content:
I wanted to buy my nieces each an iTouch because I wanted them to have Internet access, but I couldn't afford to pay for a phone bill every month. This fit the bill. It has that great Apple engineering that I could count on. And they just look flat out cool. It was expensive, but I saved my money. It isn't a gift I could afford every year, but Apple puts out a product that lasts many years.
If you can afford it, do it. And believe me, I know a lot of us are having trouble putting food on the table and a roof over our heads, so I don't say this lightly.

Title: Cup equals 5.3 Ounces?
Content:
Sent this to Hamilton Beach to see what they say:  This is about BrewStation® 6 Cup Coffeemaker
MODEL: 48274.   Your web page and the box says 6 cup.  A cup is 8 ounces, so to me 6 cups is 48 ounces.   But, the most water I was able to put in was 36 ounces, and that caused it to overflow all over the counter.   How many ounces do you consider a cup to be?   Realistically and safely, I am really only able to get 32 ounces in the reservoir.  That would be two 16 ounce cups or 2 2/3 12 ounce cups., or FOUR 8 ounce cups.   But no matter what I do, I do not see how this can be a 6 cup coffemaker, unless you think a cup is a little over 5 ounces.

Title: Disappointed.
Content:
Most of the heat given off by the unit goes straight up and therefore it really needs to be close to you if you want to feel the heat during the first hour or so that it is on.  I was looking for a unit that would instantly heat the area in front of it.
It doesn't seem to give off enough heat to heat a large room--or if it can, it would take many hours to do it.  Once again, I wanted a unit that made a difference in the temperature of the room more quickly.  
I was also disappointed when the directions that come with the unit indicate that this should NOT be used in a bathroom.  The information on this site lists "Bathroom water-splash protection," so I was hoping to use it in the bathroom.
On the positive side--it is quiet.

Title: Same as iPod, but more versatile
Content:
I got a 60GB Ipod video for x-mas, and almost opened it, until I read that this was coming down the pike.
After a bit of inverstigating, I realized, that I would be spending a lot of time converting video to have it run on the Ipod, but that wouldn't be the case with the Vision:M.
To get video from my Tivo to my Vision:M is a breeze.
Only 1 very quick conversion is needed using DirectShow Dump (about 2-3 minutes per 1/2 hour of video) to strip the Tivo code and leave a plain MPEG-2 file that can be viewed on the device.
The screen is phenomenal. It's why I got this instead of the original Zen Vision (I wanted the bigger screen, but heard lots of bad things about the Zen Vision's screen).
Album art works pretty well, but not great.
The headphones, I thought, were pretty darn good, but I upgraded anyway b/c I had the $$$ available.
It's does everything I wanted/needed a device like this to do.
I have a few complaints though:
- THERE ARE NO ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR THIS THING!!!!
- 30GB goes quickly with 192kbps MP3 files, and video and pictures.
- some videos build audio sync problem as time progresses, but this is easily corrected with a quick Pause/Play.
- it scratches just as easily as the Ipod, so do yourself a favor and order an Invisible Shield at the same time.
- the little adapter is a bit of a pain as I'm probably going to have to order at least one more to be my "travel adapter".

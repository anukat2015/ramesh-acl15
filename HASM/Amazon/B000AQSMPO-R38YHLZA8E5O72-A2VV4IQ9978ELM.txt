Title: so easy to use!
Content:
After doing much research, I settled on this (the "Special Edition") Keurig coffee maker.  We have used it at least three times a day since it arrived.  Bottom line - it's simple to use, it's fun to use, it looks sharp, and is everything I wanted.  No surprises - the quest on line and in stores to find all the flavors we want to try is a bit of a treasure hunt - I hear there are 200 varieties!
I would purchase this again, and am planning on purchasing one as a gift in the near future for my mom-in-law.

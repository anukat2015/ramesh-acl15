Title: Great Vacuum but needs service in less than 2 years!
Content:
This is a great vacuum.  Works well on carpeted and hard wood surfaces.  Has good attachments too.  I am disappointed, however, that I have not owned it for two years yet (more like 20 months) and already it needs to be repaired.  The wiring that controls the hard floor vs. carpet control has gone bad.  As a result, it no longer works on carpeted surfaces.  I will be calling the service center tomorrow to get an estimate on the cost of repairs, but needless to say I am not impressed with the durability of this product.  My other Hoover upright is 7 years old and still going strong, so less than two years is a big disappointment.

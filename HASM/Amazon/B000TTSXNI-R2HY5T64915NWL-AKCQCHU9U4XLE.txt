Title: I'm moving up to the 755320
Content:
I've had this heater for 2 to 4 years but have been frustrated by the on-board controls that only let you choose 70 or 75 degrees.  I doubt the remote would let you choose something in between, but I never wanted to use the remote so I really don't know.  Also, at the tail end of this last winter, the on-board controls didn't seem to work quite right anymore.  However, it was quiet, heated effectively, and had a very small footprint. 
So I have just bought a Lasko 755320 from Fred Meyer on sale (10/4/09) for $45 and the cashier found a coupon for me that took another $5 off.  I just plugged it in and now I can choose any degree I want!  Yea!!  Even if I find the digital thermometer a bit inaccurate I'm confident I'll be able to compensate. If it's too hot, I'll just set the temp lower until I find what feels right to me. Vice versa for being too cold. I've read complaints about the beeping it makes when you change settings, but I live by myself so there's no danger of waking up a partner.

Title: 5 stars for heating...still on the fence for durability and customer service
Content:
Purchased two of this heater from Polsteins via Amazon 10/20/05.
They heat extremely well a room that is 17x20 with 20 ft ceilings toasty warm in less than 1hr!!!  
BUT after 1 month 1 unit goes completely KAPUT!!
like it shorted out or something.
2nd unit, works like its brand new.
Perhaps I just got a lemon, we'll see if Polsteins exchanges it for me or refunds the purchase price.  My first e-mail to them they told me to call Vornado, called Vornado they told me to call Polsteins..........

Title: INCREDIBLE SOUND QUALITY AND VOLUME forn the money.
Content:
Bought one, a was so impressed, bought three more as gifts. My expectations were so low, for $[...] sale price, that I was thrilled with the quality of sound and its volume. Perfect for my friend with advanced Alzhiemer's  who is not allowed headphones for safety reasons.  Filled one with swing era music and she is calmer since she music she likes with her at all times. (Also I recorded my voice on another card for her.)  My elderly mother loves her choice of music with her on her wherever she goes...hates headphones.  My ten year old friend likes to dance to her music w friends.   I  like it because I can drop them and they don't break and it is red and hard to lose.  Drop into my pocket and run short errands.

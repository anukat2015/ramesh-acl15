Title: Excellent Italian design but under standarized materials...
Content:
I own one of this machines for a year.  The cappuccino's milk acrylic tank do not supports the high temperatures that must be reached in order to frog the milk in a cutting-edge stream of steam technology.  The acrylic tank -espontaneously- begin to crack in a nice surrealistic pattern in less than a couple of months (or about 20 times of use) and the sylicone packings begin to drift around the cylinders, spraying the steam in other directions than in the tank circuit pipes.  I found a cloging problem too, maybe due to the water's hardness.Also, the thermostat included in the coffee-maker side do not regulates wisely the temperature.  If you let the coffee-maker auto-regulate the temperature for more than 15 minutes after dripped, you are in risk to drink a cooked "sour coffee".I'm a costarican coffee taster and prefer the german home models of cappuccino machines and coffee-makers (Krups, Braun).  Nevertheless, the italians has the glory in developing these technologies, by now we only can enjoy this great tastes in commercial not-for-home-users coffee machines.I has read the other writers point of view about this coffee machine and I respect their opinion, but that was not my experience with Delonghi coffee machines. Maybe mine was made on a Monday!!

Title: Excellent for audio, but watch out on video...
Content:
This iPod is so small it can be taken anywhere and not even noticed.  It has excellent audio and video quality and the interface is good.  Coverflow is fairly pointless, but the classic controls work well.  The battery life is amazing if you are listening to audio, but abysmal with video.  I can barely eke out two hours on video playback.  This one problem makes me wish for something more...plus iTunes delivers purchased video at 640X480, without the option to scale down to the pixel density of the player, allowing you to cram more video onto an already cramped storage space.

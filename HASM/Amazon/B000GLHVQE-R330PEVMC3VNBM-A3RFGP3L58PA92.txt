Title: We love this heater!
Content:
We bought this heater to warm our bedroom in our unheated country bungalow, and to provide something of an alternative to a "real" pellet stove.  It's great as a heater.  It of course has no thermostat or remote control, but the high and low settings provide some variability, and the unit worked like a trooper, day in and day out, for 5 days straight.  I find the visual to be very pleasant to look at.  I compared it to the Bionaire (cheesy), and I like it even better than the larger unit that Dimplex sells, which has some cheesy-looking red tinsel on the fake logs.  We're very happy!

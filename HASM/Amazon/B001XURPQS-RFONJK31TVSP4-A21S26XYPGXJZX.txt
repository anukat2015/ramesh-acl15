Title: SO Glad I upgraded my XTi!
Content:
I have been very happy with my XTi, purchased 2 years ago and a really great camera. I was having a hard time justifying upgrading it to another model without jumping from a 3-digit model to a 2-digit model. I went with a friend to look at cameras, and he was looking at the T1i. I got a chance to hold it and fell in love. The design upgrades, the speed, the weight, all sold me. I love love love this camera, and I'm very glad I took the leap to upgrade from my XTi.

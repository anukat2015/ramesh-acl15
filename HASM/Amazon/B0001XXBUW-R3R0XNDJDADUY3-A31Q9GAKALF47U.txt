Title: I wish there were a *0* stars option...
Content:
Is there anything worse than to be up at 5am with your infant, waiting for your morning coffee to brew only to find it all over the counter, cabinets and floor! What's worse than having to clean an enormous, scalding hot mess?--> Having to do it first thing in the morning before your coffee!!!
I've owned this coffee maker for a year....  Found out about this 'little' design flaw early on.  I know how to align and check everything and this still periodically happens.  Nearly every time we have houseguests, if someone else makes the coffee, it happens to them...poor things.  Anyhow, there's gotta be a better machine out there and I will find it..I'm not drinking my a.m. coffee at 3pm so this machine is NOT WORTH THE GIGANTIC pain in the a$$ of cleaning the mess!

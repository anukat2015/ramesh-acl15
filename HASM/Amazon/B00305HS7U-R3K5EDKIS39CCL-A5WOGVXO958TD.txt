Title: The Notorious B.I.G. Laptop...
Content:
I purchased this computer for a family member.  They basically wanted a "mobile desktop" that they could take on travel. This laptop is big... so big that u may find a hard time finding a bag for it.  All in all, we like the laptop and do recommend it.  Just consider if you really need a unit this big.
Pros:
- The laptop performs well.  No lag issues when using Windows 7 home premium.
- This unit definitely has some "bling" factor to it.  When my bro pulled out the laptop during a meeting, everyone wanted to check it out.
- Has just about every port you will ever need.
Cons:
- As other reviewers have said, the multi-media buttons are very easy to hit.  You'll probably want to disable them.
- Would have been nice to have dedicaded graphics.
- Don't buy this laptop if u need battery life. A bigger battery is available from Toshiba if you need it.
- Big and heavy.  Unless you have a substantive need for a laptop this big, I suggest you get something smaller.

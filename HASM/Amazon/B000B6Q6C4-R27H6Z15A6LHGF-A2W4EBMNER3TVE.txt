Title: Functional, not much more than that
Content:
My wife and I purchased this for our living room as a supplemental heating source. Although it worked well for several months, after the 4th month the timer on the unit quit functioning. This means that the unit is essentially an on/off unit. Other than that, it has been fine. It actually works much better in our guest room which now gets quite toasty. Without the timer this unit is not as efficient for use so watch out for those electric bills!

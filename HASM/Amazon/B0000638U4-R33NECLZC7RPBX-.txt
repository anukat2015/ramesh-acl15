Title: It does what it advertises
Content:
It's quiet, it cools a room very quickly. You do need a lot of room for this unit, approx 30&quot; high, 25&quot; wide and 15&quot; deep.  It is heavy and bulky.  The wheels help but it would be too hard to move it up any steps.  It makes a slight gurgling sound which is not bothersome, almost like a water fountain.  You want to make sure blue goes with your decor because there's no hiding this unit.It would be perfect if it was at least one third smaller and came in other colors.

Title: Reliable Heater!
Content:
All in all this is a good heater!  Easy to use (three buttons not counting the on/off).  Heats quckly and has small openings on the front and sides so to keep out kids fingers and pets paws. Heats up my good sized room all around well.  Not bright like other heaters so that you can't watch TV due to the brightness projected.  
Keep in mind that it's an electric heater. It will not heat up your entire house nor a massive victorian ceiling room.  Plus you must keep it on the floor (good hard surface).  The cord is long, but I needed an extension. KEEP in mind you NEED to purchase a special contractor grade extension cord capable of taking 1200 volts (12.5) or else you risk fire (this is how many fires happen in the winter).  
Know what you're buying.  This is a good higher end heater.  Follow the directions and you'll be fine and this heater will give you warmness on those cold nights.

Title: Great for the money
Content:
I am very happy with my purchase. The Ipod is so expensive and not nearly as efficient. My sister has one and I have 3 times as many songs on my bean. I have found that even dropping it several times, im clumsy, that despite what I originally thought it has withheld very well.
I do not like the fact that you pretty much are forced to use sony software but it is quick and easy to use.

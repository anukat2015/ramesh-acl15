Title: iPod Touch 2G (16GB) Review
Content:
This is one of the best electronic devices I ever purchased. It does pretty much whatever you want when it comes to music, internet, and gaming. The battery life is comparable to any other ipod. It's fast and the sound is great. [...]. You'll love this iPod. Make sure you upgrade to 3.1.1 by the way.

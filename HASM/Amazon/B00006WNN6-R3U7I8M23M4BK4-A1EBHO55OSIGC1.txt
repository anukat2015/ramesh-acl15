Title: DeLonghi SafeHeat Fan Heater
Content:
I LOVE this little heater. It is one of my favorite purchases within it's price range. Now, you can't buy this heater expecting it to heat a huge room in your home (that's not what it's meant to do) but I use it in my bedroom and I live in a very old townhouse with very drafty windows, and it makes a huge difference in keeping the temperature in the room comfortable. I like that you can set the dials and then it turns on and off on it's own ... keeping the temperature consistent. I generally only use it on the lowest setting (1) and between the heat setting of 2-3 on the opposite dial. It's very small so I can set it up on a little footstool so it's at the same level as the bed. It's very quiet and small, and I prefer it over the larger more "hazardous" space heaters. I've had mine for several years and never had any issues with it breaking, etc. But I also only use it during the winter months, and I am pretty gentle with my appliances. I'm going to get one for my mother for her birthday - she has a two-story room that gets very cold in the winter. She said she doesn't like space heaters but this one is so small and doesn't get hot, so she will be able to set it on her end table in the living room just like a small fan.

Title: a perfect cup of coffee...
Content:
We resisted this product for a couple of years thinking the single-serve coffees available just cost too much, until we realized how much coffee we wasted with our old machine because it sat too long in the carafe, getting scorched.  The Keurig brews a perfect cup and the available varieties are just about endless.  If you are cost-conscious you can squeeze another, slightly weaker 1/2 cup out of each container.

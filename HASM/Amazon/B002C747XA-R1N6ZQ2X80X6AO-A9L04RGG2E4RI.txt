Title: Best laptop ever!
Content:
First of all, I want to say im from Bolivia, very few people use Macs here. A lot of friends told me i was making a mistake in changing my HP tx2000 Tablet for the MBA. Im happy to say i was never so delighted with a laptop. Ive own several PC's before but definitely I wont change to PC's ever again. I use my Mac for not so complicated tasks like emailing, word, excel, etc. If you want a reliable laptop and extremely fast one buy the MBA with SSD. It is faaaaaast, i cant beleive it starts up in barely 30 seconds, safari, itunes and even Microsoft word for Mac start instantly. To this day, my system never crashed, never got an error message and never got any problem to do what i wanted. By the way, i like messing around with my laptop so i did everything to cause a crash or even slow the MBA but nothing happened. I totally recommend this computer to anyone unless you want to do heavy tasks like CAD design. I didnt do anything so demanding so I cant comment but for me it is just perfect. Altough it has a high price tag it is definitely worth it. I give this laptop 5 stars because thanks to it Ive become a Mac OS fan.

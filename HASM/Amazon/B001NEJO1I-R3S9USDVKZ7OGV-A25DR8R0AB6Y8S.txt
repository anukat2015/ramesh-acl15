Title: Great Laptop
Content:
I wanted an allround laptop and this is just about how all round it can get for $800. To start with, its a stunner to look at. I have owned it for about a month now and I ve used it so far to watch movies, browse internet as well as download heavy files (left it on for more than 24hours once) and listening to songs. I ve attached my Altec Lansing MX5021 to them and they have this Dolby tool that fire up its bass. Its a great buy, GO FOR IT!

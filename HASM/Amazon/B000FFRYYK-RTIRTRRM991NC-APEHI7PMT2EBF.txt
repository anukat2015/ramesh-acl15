Title: Good system but thermal pot soon begins to leak.
Content:
We had another Bunn coffee pot which we loved.  We wanted the thermal pot for our new one and it worked great for a couple weeks.  However, then it started to leak around the rubber seals.  We tried washing it well with dish soap but that doesn't cure the problem.  We will have to contact Bunn for a replacement.  We had read that this was a problem but thought they had designed a new pot, apparently NOT.

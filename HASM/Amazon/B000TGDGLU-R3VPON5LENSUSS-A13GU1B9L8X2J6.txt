Title: Unbelievable quality for a great price
Content:
My wife is a coldie and I'm a hottie (well, not really)  Our bedroom is 17x16 and our adjoining bath is very good sized as well.  This beauty adjustably heats up both the bedroom AND the bathroom to exactly your temperature. We can leave the house thermostat on 65 and wake up in heated splendor with this device.  Very little electricity use - as evidenced by our last month's $50 gas and $100 electric bill - acclimatizing a 2300sf house.

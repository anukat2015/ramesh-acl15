Title: This is a great product
Content:
I have had my ROTHO Twin TT home cleaning system for a little over eight months. I love my ROTHO TT, it has been a life saver on many occasions already. 
Having a family and a pet, you never know what challenge may arise. Not to mention, my house feels so much cleaner knowing I'm removing all the dirt my old vacuum left behind. 
Understanding this is not just a vacuum or a carpet cleaner, is a major asset for me. The unit moves across my floors almost effortlessly with its front swivel wheels. 
This unit changes from vacuuming to shampooing in a breeze and I highly recommend the ROTHO TT, its a great product and a good investment.

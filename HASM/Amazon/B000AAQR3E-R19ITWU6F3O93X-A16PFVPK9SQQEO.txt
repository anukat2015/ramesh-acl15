Title: Best I've ever owned
Content:
I am 66 yrs old and have been using a vacuum (Hoover, Electrolux & everything in between)for nearly 50 years.  This is by far the easiet, best suction, certainly nice looking and I can actually pick this one right up and take upstairs!  This was one of the best decisions I've made.  The cost should not even be a factor, especially if you have tile and carpet which I do.  I have NO complaints whatsoever.  Hope I've helped in your decision.

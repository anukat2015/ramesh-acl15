Title: Powerful Laptop, Amazing price
Content:
I did a hefty amount of research on all types of laptops before making this purchase.  This Laptop was by far the biggest bang for my buck.  At the time of purchase, I could not find a laptop with an Intel i5 processor and this much Ram and hard drive space as this for under $1,000.  However, this came in significantly lower than that.  Additionally, I really despise the fact that every computer you buy nowadays is preloaded with so much garbage that cannot be removed without buying special software to remove it.  This computer just came with the necessary software (i.e. Windows 7, etc).
Great purchase, I would recommend this Laptop to anyone

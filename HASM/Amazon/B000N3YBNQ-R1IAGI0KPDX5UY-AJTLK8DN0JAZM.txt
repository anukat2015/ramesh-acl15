Title: Most powerful vac ever, so far...
Content:
Nice vac with incredible power! It's gets every bit of hair out of all the different types of carpet and area rugs we have, and with 2 dogs and 3 cats, that's a tough job. The only draw backs are the small dust bag and it is the heaviest vac I've ever owned.  So I'm still stuck using two vacs to clean my house, the "monster" Intensity for carpets, and the Harmony for hardwood and tile.
I would not recommend this item for the elderly or anyone with back problems  because of the strength needed to use it...for everyone else, it's a workout!

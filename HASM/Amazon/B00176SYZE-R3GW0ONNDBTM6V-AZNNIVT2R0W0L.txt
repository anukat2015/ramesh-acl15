Title: PERFECT, STYLISH, EASY TO USE.
Content:
I was looking for a couple of AFFORDABLE, QUALITY, NAME BRAND MP3 PLAYERS for me & my 11 year old daughter & I found this item here on AMAZON. I live in Brooklyn, NY & the product was located at J&R MUSIC WORLD (an electronics store I have actually been to) located in down town lower Manhattan, so I knew it would quick shipping (right across the Brooklyn bridge). I have tried the CHEAP MP3 PLAYERS before (IPOD look-a-likes), & believe me you get what you pay for-cheap, poor quality=problems & returns.
I originally, wanted an IPOD for the 2 of us & promised myself when I got the money, I would buy the IPOD this time. Instead I came across this product & the REVIEWS were 5 stars or close to 5 stars most of the time & it was also suggested to save your money when being compared to the IPOD. So I purchased 2 of them & they were delivered in no time at all. I could't wait to get started. I charged it, hooked it up to my computer (the manual was useless & so was the little CD that came with the instructions. The little CD didn't even work on my computer)So I was left with no choice but to figure out how to work the device on my own. It turned out to be 98% COMMON SENSE (at least putting MUSIC on it was SIMPLE as 123. I havent tried pictures yet, or videos...)! I plugged in the USB cable, logged onto RHASPODY which detected the device immediately & I simply started transferring all the songs I wanted & loved from the website onto the device (the old DRAG & DROP technique). I charged it overnight & enjoyed my music on a very long train ride from BROOKLYN to the BRONX the night after the day it was delivered to my house (thats how quick I learned to operate the thing & enjoy it).
As far as "LOOKS", this device is EXTREMELY HANDSOME & SLEEK. The touch pad is very easy to learn to operate. Its very sensitive, but you will get the swing of it (its fun). I finally found a screen protector that will protect the entire face of this device from scratches & damage (I ordered 2 for my daughter & me). Its clear too, so the beauty will still remain while you wont have to worry about scratching the surface of the item, while using it.
BUY IT!!!

Title: Not for me
Content:
I have tried this vacuum for three days now and I am afraid I am going to have to send it back. I live in the Pacific Northwest, where we have lots of fir trees and the mess that goes with them. I have a little girl with long hair. And a cat. I purchased this for hardwood floors and the low pile area rugs I have in three rooms. I liked the canister (my prior vacuum was an upright). I like how easy it is to move, get under the furniture, change to the attachments. However, on the low pile rugs. I watched at my daughter's hair was moved around the rug, not picked up. Lint and little bits were left on the rugs. Then I moved to the hardwood floors. Nice suction and great easy of movement; but it seemed like it was only sucking in the middle of the brush....like I was using an attachment, rather than the sweeper part. When I was done, I still noticed crumbs and fir tree bits. One reviewer commented on the clever way to store the wand and I would have to agree. I would also say that the cord is relatively short; but I liked that it retracted automatically. For my needs, this vacuum did not cut the mustard. Sigh.

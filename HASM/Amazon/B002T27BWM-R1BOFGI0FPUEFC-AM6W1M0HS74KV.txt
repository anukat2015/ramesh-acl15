Title: Toshiba T135-S1305
Content:
This lap top has met all my expectations.  The battery life was one of my key selling points and has lasted a three hour drive while watching movies with lots of power to spare (the pasangers where watching the movie).  This lap top is the perfect size.  It is thin and small enough to fit in a backpack or under a car seat.  The 13 inch screen is perfect for web serfing and watching movies.  The resolution is very crisp.  I have not tried the eco mode yet whitch will prolong the battery life. I did about three months of research and am very happy with my purchase.

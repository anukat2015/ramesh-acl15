Title: Make sure you need this filter before you buy
Content:
I bought the Mr. Heater Hose with a regulator and quick disconnect fitting for the Big Buddy Heater. When it arrived, I discovered that I could not connect the fuel filter to the quick disconnect fitting. I called Mr. Heater, and they informed me that I didn't need the fuel filter if I was using a hose with an attached regulator. It would have been nice if Amazon had indicated this fact when I purchased the filter. But, none of the specifications for the product demonstrated this redundency. If you buy the hose with the regulator, then you don't need this filter.

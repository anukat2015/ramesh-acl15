Title: Wonderful Laptop!
Content:
When searching for a new laptop I was astounded to find that there were already models with 6GB RAM. I was floored by this particular model's stats for how low a price it was and bought it immediately.
The best things about this laptop? The RAM, memory, price, finger print scan, webcam, the smooth keyboard, and even the stylish design on the case!
The bad? Well, fingerprints are easily left all over the thing, but that most certainly does not offset all the wonderful aspects.
I have yet to regret this purchase!

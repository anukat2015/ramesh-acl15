Title: Great Netbook, but has sound issues
Content:
I am no tech expert but a simple laptop user. Here's my plain verdict on this netbook. 
This is a great lightweight netbook, perfect if you mainly use a laptop to browse the Net on the go. The only complaint is that the box speakers have sound issues like an occasional crackling sound while playing music, talk, etc. The speakers are still powerful enough for a computer of this size. I don't have any other complaints on this wonderful netbook and I love that it is so very easy to carry around (the only problem I have with my MacBook Pro 17" notebook, but well of course I knew  it when I got it. I wanted a bigger screen and was ready to put up with the weight).

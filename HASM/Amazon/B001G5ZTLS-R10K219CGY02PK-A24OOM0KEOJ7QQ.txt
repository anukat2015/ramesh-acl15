Title: Not great but pretty good
Content:
As far as 20mp and up cameras go this one is a steal at its price. It's real price, not what you are being gouged on the net for. Wait for Amazon to have it in stock don't buy the kit for more than 3499. the AF system and metering system are extremely outdated. I understand they left this old system in here so it would not totally eclipse the 1dsMKIII but Nikon is putting top notch 3D matrix metering in all of their cameras and fast AF systems as well. This is a bit of a let down. Beyond that the images are resolved well by the processor, better use good glass, and HIGH ISO is handled almost as well as the D3 and D700 which is impressive seeing has how the pixels are much smaller to fit more on the sensor. I think this camera will be a good launching point for future models from Canon and definitely raises the bar drastically for their pro line. If you are already well invested into Canon glass go for it. If you want a high res camera that does HD video as well this one blows the D90 out of the water.

Title: Quick and easy to clean
Content:
I go to work very early in the morning, and often forget to clean my coffemaker the day before. Not a problem, it takes 2 minutes (tops) to clean and refill this baby and get it started while I get ready in the morning. One caveat, however, don't put too much coffee in the filter or you will get a mouthful of coffee grounds on your last sip.

Title: Best Computer Ever
Content:
This is my second Mac.  The first already made me think differently about computers.  More reliable, fast and easy to use than all Pcs I ever used.   The battery duration is amazing, the lighted keyboard is excellent, the screen and its resolution is perfect.  This is a fantastic computer not only for entertainment but for corporate or home office use.  Even if you need (I can't find a reason) to use Windows, you can do it in your Mac and amazingly it works better than in a Pc.  Now that I'm talking about the operating system, Snow Leopard is the best thing I ever used.  If you are considering to buy a computer, I really suggest you look very close at Mac choices.  To finish:  It will be really, really difficult for me to consider a computer different from Mac.

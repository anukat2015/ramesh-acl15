Title: Best Coffee Maker Ever.  Period.
Content:
Anyone who likes coffee and hasn't tried a Keurig coffee maker before will wonder how they ever got by without it once they try this machine.  Never again will you have to decide whether brewing a nice cup of coffee is worth all the hassle and wait of measuring out coffee grounds, brewing a whole pot, and cleaning up the mess afterwards.  Keurig reduces the whole process down to brewing a perfect cup of coffee inside 2 minutes, cleanup included (which simply consists of throwing away the expended k-cup - painless).  Whenever I have guests over, they think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread (and I agree).  There are a plethora of flavor choices out there for coffee and tea as well from various brands.  I now have the B-40 at home and the B-60 at work.  The only downsides (and these are minor): The B-40 water pump is a tad noisy for the 5 seconds or so it takes to transfer water into the heating chamber.  The B-60 is much quieter, though my B-60 tends to clog from time to time, requiring a good tap on the top to clear it out, at which point it brews fine (I've had my B-40 for over a year and it has never clogged).

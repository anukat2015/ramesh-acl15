Title: Better than I expected
Content:
I purchased the heater for the basement and it works better than I expected.   I never thought that it would heat the whole basement but it does.  I love it!  It has a thermostat that keeps the room at exactly the temp I want.  I also love that if it gets knocked over it shuts off.  The remote is great I can turn it off or adjust the temp from any where in the room.  I am definitely getting another one for upstairs.

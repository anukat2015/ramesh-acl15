Title: Great portable
Content:
Having used this for about 3 weeks to replace my window unit, I am quite happy with the performance of  portable air conditioner .It cools quickly enough and the setup was quite simple. It is quite portable and easy to wheel around.  The color and design is nice for a portable unit.  It arrived well packaged and within 3-4 days of my order.  I had a few setup up questions and the manufacturer customer support was incredibly helpful. I would highly recommend this brand."

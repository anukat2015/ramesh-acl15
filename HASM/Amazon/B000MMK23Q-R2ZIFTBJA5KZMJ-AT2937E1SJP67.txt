Title: One of the best Heat Sources ever, the Eden Pure GEN3
Content:
Worth its price.  Heats like it says, if not better, fits with any decor and is asthetically pleasing, works great as a primary heat source, or as a accompaniment for your primary heat source, is safe for pets, children and disabled individuals, unlike a regular heater it has a thermostat and you do not have to keep an eye on it when it is being used. A Great Product which I highly recommend.

Title: Love It
Content:
I did a lot of research before buying this. I looked at a lot of different options and based on other peoples reviews decided Toshiba was the way to go. I bought it from Amazon because in the past I have had exceptionally good luck with their customer service (no, they are not paying me) :).
It seemed that customer service was the biggest issue others had with their laptop which I why I went the Amazon route.
The laptop itself is easy to use, very comfortable to use and has a great screen. I have only used it a couple of times, but I am loving it so far.

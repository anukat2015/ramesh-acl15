Title: great deal
Content:
this is a very good alternative to the Ipod, if you do not care about fancy and light stuff, and want a good product to store all your music.
Works very well, good sound quality, and the only problems I found:
- the touch sensitive control does not work as well as in the ipod, and sometimes is annoying the lack of control.
- It is not sleek, and is heavy. Do not buy it for sports.
- As in others including ipod, the quality of the headphones do not match the player. Try good headphones, and you will understand... my advice for a moderate price: Senheisser PX100. 40$ regular price, about 12-18$ refurbished. A great deal.

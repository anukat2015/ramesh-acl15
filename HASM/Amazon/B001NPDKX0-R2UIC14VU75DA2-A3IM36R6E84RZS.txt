Title: Jury still out
Content:
I love the speed, but nevertheless I've got four issues w/ it so far: 1) The amazon people misled me as to the make-up of the ram in the machine -- they told me there were four slots of 2 gb, with three of them filled, when in fact there are two slots, one w/ 4 gb of ram, the other with two. Based on what they told me, i ordered 2 gb of ram, which is now useless. I need one 4 gb chip.
2) sending in the mail-in rebate was a hassle, haven't seen the $50 yet...
3) And, most importantly, my new computer freezes frequently, such as when it comes out of sleep mode. A friend who had an HP and who will never buy one again said that this always happened w/ her HDX premium series... 4) The keys make too much noise... 
I like the speed and the price, but i'm not 100% sold on the purchase, and if the freezing up continues, it will have been a catastrophic purchase... 
Update: Six months out, I'm liking the purchase better. The freezing up hasn't been too bad, I did receive my rebate, and I've gotten used to the noisy keyboard -- now I barely notice. And I like the computer's speed.

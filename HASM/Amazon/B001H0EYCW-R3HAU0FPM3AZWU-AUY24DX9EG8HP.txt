Title: The special features don't work
Content:
This is an relatively expensive fan and it does have the necessary safety features to be allowed by fire code in our office - that is a good thing. But the heater will turn off at a certain point and never turn on again. The oscillation features makes it heat up and smell like it is malfunctioning.  Also, the fact that the temperature is only in Celsius just makes it confusing and harder to use than it should be. I wish there was a way to convert this.

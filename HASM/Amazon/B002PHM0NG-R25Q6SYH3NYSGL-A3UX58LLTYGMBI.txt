Title: Great features,price,looks,one FATAL flaw
Content:
I purchased the sony vaio VGN-NW270F. Initially I was happy with it and the blue-ray. Shortly however I noticed when I charged the laptop to 100% and turned the laptop off,24 hours later the battery would be at 90% or less. This issue is common on ALL newer vaios, google it if you do not believe me. Search "Sony Vaio battery drain". Sony will not release a "fix" for it,in fact in one customer service report they describe this as a feature. The battery life never exceeds 2.5 hours either (4 hours listed). I jumped the gun big time buying this laptop. Do your research, now I will take a 85% hit in return price and need a new laptop for school starting January.

Title: Gray Beauty
Content:
Beautfully appointed black and gray case as compared to the sterile silver notebooks.  Good buy at $649 no tax and free shipping. Best feature is the lightscribe if you have to mark CDs. It carries Vista Home Premium, and Compaq has integrated it really well with the hardware. Has no internet buttons, but lots of hot keys. However, this unit is no lightweight if you have to schlepp it around.  Finally, the bright screen is not glary and is comfortable to work with. 
Warning: The worst feature is that Compaq does not register the Vista OS with Bill Gates.  You have to do it, and my experience was like a combat patrol in Iraq because the online registration did not function.  Worse, Bill Gates shuts you down in 30 days if you do not complete registration. Frankly, I would not have purchased had I foreseen the demeaning experience of struggling with people in Bombay and their sing song nerve racking accent. You would think that Bill Gates can afford to pay American customer reps.

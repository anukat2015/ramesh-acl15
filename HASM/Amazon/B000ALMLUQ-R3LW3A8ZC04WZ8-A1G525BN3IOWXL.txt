Title: Some Good, Some Bad
Content:
This machine has some good points, and it has some bad.
Pros
----
It's clean.
It's reasonably quiet.
Once you learn what all the blinking lights do, it's easy to use.
The price for the machine isn't that bad.
There is a nice selection of coffees, teas, and other drinks.
It's built pretty well. Very solid.
It's pretty quick. Takes about a minute to warm up, and then about 30 seconds to make a cup of coffee.
Cons
----
All in all, the drinks are kind of expensive. You have to order them from the Flavia website. While the pouches are usually less than 50 cents a piece, many drink recipes take two or three pouches to make. So now you're up to $1.50 per drink. But it doesn't stop there. Even the cheapest shipping rates can run you about $9. In the end, you're going to end up spending about $1.75 per drink.
The expense wouldn't be that big of an issue, BUT the coffee really isn't that good. I think a cup of freshed brewed Folgers tastes better, and that's saying a lot.
The creamer pouches that you use to make cappuccinos taste bad. It's basically like frothed up non-dairy creamer powder. I usually add a little real milk to make the drinks taste better.
A single pouch makes a pretty small cup of coffee. If you're a big coffee drinker, you might have to use two pouches per cup.
Nutshell
--------
If I could do it all over again, I might not have bought this machine. I haven't tried any of the other pod type machines, but I'm not 100% happy with this one.

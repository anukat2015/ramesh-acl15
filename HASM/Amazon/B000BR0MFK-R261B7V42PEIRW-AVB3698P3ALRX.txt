Title: Video was a great add!
Content:
The new iPod nano I think was one of the best iPods. It's definitely one of the most enjoyable mp3 players around, and they definitely made an improvement on this one. The best add to the nano I think was the feature to be able to play video. It has a nice sized screen, which is larger than the previous one. The 8 gig hard drive is not that bad considering how small it is. I did buy a case and a couple of accessories to go with it since I didn't pay for my iPod nano. And BTW those wondering how I got it just go here: flingk.com/n21v9v1 Saw it on G4TV and it works that's all I have to say. I definately like the new interface they have for the iPod nano, overall this is pretty much the most reliable iPod.

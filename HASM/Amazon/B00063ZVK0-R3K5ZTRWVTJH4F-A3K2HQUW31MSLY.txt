Title: No complaints.
Content:
I have owned this heater for a number of years now and have had no problems with it at all. Originally purchased to bring a guest room to a comfortable temperature for a guest, I have also used it to keep a greenhouse warm in sub-freezing temperatures and as a bathroom heater from time to time. This is not a heater to stand in front of to get a blast of heat. The way it circulates the air throughout the room keeps the ceiling level the same temperature as the floor level. No more hot head and cold feet!

Title: Sony vs. iAudio7
Content:
I agree with all the other reviews praising this unit's sound quality, intuitive style, etc.  I also own an iAudio7 (Cowon) and I mainly listen to audiobooks (ie., NetLibrary and Overdrive).  Having said that, I'd like to point out a few features that I wish the Sony possessed:
1. ability to bookmark;
 
2. a timer, or "sleep" function;
3. a way to scan (FF or Rew) in variable intervals; for example, if I'm listening to a 12-hour audiobook from NetLibrary and I lose my place, or want to listen to another book, or music for awhile, the first book restarts at the beginning.  Holding down the FF button, the scanning takes place at one speed only, and can take several minutes to get back to where I left off.  Longer if I didn't notice the elapsed time beforehand. 
4. when the temporary rights to listen to the audiobook expire, the Sony simply refuses to play it anymore!
The iAudio7 has all of these features, and will play the book until I delete it (however, I can't transfer it after the expiration date).  
Overall, a great little mp3 player, and I'm very pleased I bought it. I haven't had an opportunity to use the video function, but for audio, I would highly recommend the Sony.

Title: Size does not matter, its the magic that it produces
Content:
This is by far the best vacuum around for the money.  Let me tell you, this little Ultra can suck big time.  I had built a vacuum pressure gauge device to measure suction power while shopping for a new vacuum and this little unit measured the most powerful in its class and price category. Other canisters did not even measure up!  I compared Kenmore, Dyson and the everyday store brands. I got 150vp on this unit compared to the others which could not get past 50vp. I was very impressed and purchased it right away. A year later as I write this I am not disappointed.  I have a cat and dog which like to shed and needed a new vacuum that could really suck the beegees out of the carpet and furniture.  Let me tell you, to get the biggest suck for your buck, this is THE vacuum! It is very easy to move around and light to carry around the house when doing stairs and furniture. It is also extremely quiet when running. Did I mention how powerful the suction power is and isn't that the objective for a vacuum? The power floor head is good on carpets and has adjustable pile height.  The only con is the tools don't all store on the unit directly and the bag is not that large so it requires changing often. But I can live with that in exchange for the power!  I have the power!

Title: Camera is excellent
Content:
I truly love the D300 it takes amazing pictures. The 18-200mm Nikon lens that comes with the camera is great for close and long distant shots. The lens is very universal for most type of photos you'll be taking. The only thing that I recommend for novice photographers as me is buying a third party book about the camera. The manual that comes with the camera is ok but it's tailored more for people who have experience with photography. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the camera.

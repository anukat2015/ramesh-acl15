Title: Ipod Touch 2nd Generation 16gb
Content:
I got this for Christmas a couple days ago, and I love it. Most of the games in the app store are actually fun, and not to expensive.  The screen resolution is AMAZING, and the touch screen is great, too.  It has an internal speaker, but it is really bad.  I recomend buying a case or skin for it because the back is a finger magnet.  The only cons are that the internal speaker is terrible, the back is a finger magnet, and you have to wipe off the touchscreen about every other day for it to work good.

Title: Ipod is the greatest
Content:
This is the best purchase I have made in a long time. Easy to use, easy to set up. Just went to ITunes. I put all my CD's on it, just insert CD, list of songs appears, check the ones you want and transfer. Just as easy to buy tunes. Sound is excellent. Portable. I didn't like the earbuds, but I bought a cheap pair that hook over the ears and still sound great. I had a portable CD player, it skips, is big, and have to carry CD's around. None of that with the ipod. If anything happened to this, I would buy another Apple ipod.

Title: canon eos 350d
Content:
i love photography and for a long time, i've been watching from the sidelines of the digital world using point and shoot cameras. when it came time to purchase a digital slr, however, it came down to either the 20d or the 350d by canon or nikon's d70. all three were entry level professional cameras, but i ended up going with the 350d--the digital rebel xt.
i have not been disappointed with this camera. it does everything from landscapes to macro to portraits. i think a lot of the people giving it lower rankings haven't taken full advantage of the camera's abilities yet or tried out new lenses; they complain about how it fits their hands without trying a battery pack, or they complain about the range (i.e. zoom) when they're using a 18-55mm lens! they need to realize that this is not a point and shoot, this is a camera that requires either previous knowledge or the ability to learn hands on. if you want to do skyline photography, you should not expect the default kit lens to do a decent job; rather, you should buy a wide angeled or telephoto lens.
in other words, it's a great camera and that's why i'm writing this review. i was seeing too many negative reviews from people who don't seem to totally get what a digital slr is and how much it requires; new lenses, new abilities, and a lot of time.

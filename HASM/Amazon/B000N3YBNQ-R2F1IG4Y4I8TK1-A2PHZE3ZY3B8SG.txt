Title: Not what I thought it would do!
Content:
I purchasesd the Electrolux EL5020A Upright because I don't have a lot of space, and I didn't want a heavy machine. Oooops, not the easiest to use. I have 95% wood floors and one area rug. It didn't glide across the floors. First clue to send it back. It did not fit under my setee which is high off the floor. Did not fit under my sleigh bed either -- not a good thing. There is a handle to use when carrying it up steps, that is why it doesn't fit under furniture. The bags do not hold very much. So even two stars may be too high.

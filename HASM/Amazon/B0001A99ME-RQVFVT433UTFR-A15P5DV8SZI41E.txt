Title: Great for Working Out at the Gym
Content:
This is the best Christmas present I could have bought for myself. It arrived in 3 days. I had purchased the armband and in-ear headphones.
It was easy to set-up and iTunes is very user friendly. Synching up songs went well, even though I don't have USB 2.0 the speed to me is acceptable.
The only minor thing is I didn't like the earphones that come with it. When I was working out they would often fall out. The sound seemed a bit tinny as well. Buy the in-ear buds and you'll be set. I jog, lift weights at use it at the gym with no problems or skipping.
It is so small it fits in the palm of your hand. No worries about tangled headphone cords and fits easily into my gym bag.
Highly recommended.

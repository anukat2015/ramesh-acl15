Title: Great Product for the Price I Paid
Content:
I ride the bus to and from work and decided to purchase an MP3 player to make the trip more enjoyable. After researching several products, I decided to purchase the SanDisck SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250. What I like about this product is it is compact but offers many features the more expensive models offer.  The sound is excellent even through the chintzy earphones they provide. Upgrade to better earphones and you won't be sorry. It is extremely easy to hook up to your computer to download your tunes. It also works with a variety of programs. (Unlike that pesky I Pod)  For the money you can't go wrong!

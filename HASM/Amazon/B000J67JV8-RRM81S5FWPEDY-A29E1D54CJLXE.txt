Title: WORTH THE PRICE!
Content:
i wasn't too excited about spending $300 on a vacuum, but i had to see if the hype was valid.  so i bought this vacuum with every intention of returning it when i proved it wasn't any diffrent from my old dirt devil.  well, that did not happen.  after getting home and assembling this product (very easy) i brought out my old vacuum (had it about 2 yrs)emptied the dirt cup, took the filter off and banged as much dust out of it as i could (creating quite a mess in the process)and vacuumed my house as i normally would.  then i broke out the healthy home.  still skeptical, i started to re vacuum my house.  i have 2 dogs, and i don't think i've ever gotten all the hair up ever.  with this vacuum i had to empty the dirt cup twice while vacuuming (which is also unbelievably easy, and no mess at all).  i was disgusted at how much dirt was left in my carpet after using my old vacuum.  after i finished with the bissell, i got down on the floor to see how much dog hair was still embedded in the carpet.  i couldn't find any.  so i did the only logical thing i could think of... i threw the dirt devil away and put the bissell in the closet.  did i mention how quiet this machine is?  it's quiet.  i love this vacuum.

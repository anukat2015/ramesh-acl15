Title: Great Design - Poor Performance
Content:
The touch-screen and colors on the Ipod touch are superb.
This is where the great story comes to an end and makes me cling onto my 4G and 5G Ipod's for performance.
The user interface is sluggish and the time lag to response irritating.
The Wi-Fi is so slow even when i stand on top of my DSL wireless router that it is waste of time to even try and check your email or surf any websites.
What make things worse is that 2 of the keys on the "Virtual Keyboard" simply do not work. These are the 5 Key and R key. I am perplexed as every time i try and attempt this input with vertical or horizontal screen orientation the input character is the adjacent key. Therefore it is usually impossible for me to login to my Gmail. It may be a defect on the screen of just my unit - but i dont know if this is the case or whether the OS of the Touch is flawed.
The sound quality is decent, but a lot needs to be done to get this Ipod to work fast , reliably and without input issues.
Performance is as important as looks when you pay so much for a device.

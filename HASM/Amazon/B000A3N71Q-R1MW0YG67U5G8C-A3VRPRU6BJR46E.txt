Title: Good product
Content:
Have had this for almost a year now. 
Pros:
The battery life is good. 
FM radio and recording.
Video out.
Removable battery
Can also double as a portable hard disk for photos during travel (bought the flash card adapter for SD card use)
Cons:
The video angle can get irritating as you have to look straight at it but when (if) found, its very good (but not as good as PSP)
I would recommend this over the iPod as I've used both. Its also easier (and MUCH faster) to transfer videos to the Zen than to the iPod.

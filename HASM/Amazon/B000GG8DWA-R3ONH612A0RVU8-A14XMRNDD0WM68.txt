Title: Does the job
Content:
After much research I settled on this heater for many reasons.  I liked the environmental aspects of it, the size, and the heating options.  I use it in my small private yoga studio and it only takes a minute or two to heat the entire room and is very quiet.  It also runs clean and heats without that "electrical scent" that some small heaters have.  Four stars instead of five because it is really hard to know what setting the control nob is at.  So I just guess till I get it right.  Small inconvenience for a good heater at a great price.

Title: The best I've ever used
Content:
I've tried many coffee makers, and this is certainly the best I've found so far. I can not imagine using anything but a thermal, and the pour-thru top they talk about really works very well. The coffee stays hot for my entire workday. A friend has one and complains about dripping while pouring, but that hasn't been my experience; you do have to make sure the top is screwed on tight and the arrow points to the spout.

Title: These babies work!
Content:
I have a 2 bedroom apartment outside of Boston. When the temperature outside drops below 20 degrees or so, the interior temp. struggles to remain above 60 degrees or so.  I have deployed three of these great heaters in my apartment and the temp. now can get well above 65 when it is really cold outside. 
A+ machine, sleek design, definetly not ugly and will get the job done.

Title: Can not handle wind or breeze
Content:
I bought this with the hope of using it at our kids outdoor sporting events, but, when ever there was a breeze, the heater would shut off.  This heater is a perfect size instead of carrying a large propane tank heater, but could not stand up to the elements.  Works great with no wind.  If they could just make it wind proof, it would be perfect.

Title: Awesome Laptop / Great Value
Content:
After replacing my 8 year old Dell Laptop, I looked into this Vaio upon the recommendation of a few friends.  I'm not a tech-guy by any stretch, just wanted a solid everyday home laptop with good memory for interent, Itunes, Quickbooks, Skype and some word processing (no gaming) and this laptop absolutely fit the bill!  Solid construction, unique and appealing design (case texture is great, shows no fingerprints), comfortable, wide and spacious keyboard, lightning fast-start up and downloads, user-freindly, gorgeous Hi-Def screen, great for watching videos and DVD's, fast CD and DVD burner and an awesome camera for Skyping with friends and family.  For the price (just a shy over $600) and complete with Windows 7, you can't beat it!  Battery life is fine too.  Unlike some complaints, mine gets just under 3 hours which suits my needs and also charges very fast.  I've had freinds that have owned Vaio's years with little to no problems, and now glad to own one myself.  If you're looking for a rock solid laptop with style and function, get this one.  I'm happy I made this purchase, would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone!

Title: Great vacuum for the price!
Content:
Canister is great with extra power heads but no place to store all of them on the unit. 
Love the bagless feature and plenty of suction (adjustable) for carpet and hard floor.  Much easier to use than my upright that I replaced since I have a variety of floors to clean (carpet, ceramic tile and hardwood)

Title: Puts off good heat, perfect if you want quiet
Content:
Puts out a lot of heat with no fan.  Works easy and I love the built in timer control.  It seems to be efficient since I am using it with other appliances and running off one small extension cord, that would indicate it can't have a huge current draw. If you want quiet then its even better.  You can feel the heat rising from it but without a noisy fan.  I would recommend it if you have the room for it and want a quiet model.

Title: They need to recall this piece of junk
Content:
My first mr. coffee (FTX41) I purchased leaked probably a third of the amount I poured in. I stupidly thought I could fix it, but you basically have to break the plastic shell to get in to see where it is leaking. I very stupidly bought the same model again thinking it was a random problem, but sure enough, my brand new model leaked right away. My in-laws have the same model and it drives them nuts with all of the leaking and problems with the carafe. Please do not buy this piece of junk. It will drive you nuts.

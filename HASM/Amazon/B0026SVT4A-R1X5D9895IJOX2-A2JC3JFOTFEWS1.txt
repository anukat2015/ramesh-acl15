Title: Nice heater...
Content:
We bought this heater for our son's room during the winter months. The oscillating features works great and the heater's temperature control is fairly accurate. For example, if the heater is not oscillating, it takes it much longer to turn off which shows how the blowing in all directions helps. The only con is the fact that it doesn't have a blower only mode.

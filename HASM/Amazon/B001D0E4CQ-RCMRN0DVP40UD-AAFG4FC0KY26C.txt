Title: Started out shaky, has gotten better and better
Content:
I was really excited about getting this player, and bought it via Amazon on release day. I even paid the extra $3.99 on Amazon Prime to get it shipped next day.
Opened the box and marvelled at how beautiful it was, then began the disappointment.
It came shipped with beta firmware and was buggy as all get out. Internet was slow, music too soft and crappy sounding, video choppy, the whole UI was just clumsy and not at all fun to deal with.
The engineers at Archos however have continued to release a fairly constant stream of firmware updates that have really started to make this player all that it has the potential to be.
The improvements are too numerous to mention, but if you are interested you can see a history of them on Archos website, or the Archosfan user forum.
I will just say that I am now very pleased to give this player 5 stars. I think it really is currently about 4.25, but I am hopeful that even more firmware updates will get it to 5 - it's pretty close right now.
As of this writing the last firmware upgrade was 12/3/08.
I would not hesitate to buy this if you are looking for an awesome multi function PMP device - well worth the investment.
I don't think there is much else out there that will stack up to this device.

Title: Best computer I have ever owned
Content:
In short this computer is amazing.  You wont find anything else under $2000 that can beat this.  It comes with a standard 2 year warrant and 1 year accidental damage warranty plus a 30 day zero bright dot policy.  The included mouse and bag are also great.  So far I have been playing crysis and bad company 2(a great game for your new computer) on near full detail with amazing frames with the ati radean 5870(best single graphics card for laptops), 8gb of 1066mhz ram, and the new blazing fast core i7 processor.  Although the computer is the size of some 18 inchers, I found that it looked and felt amazing.  The whole back, palm rest area, and keys are rubberized which provides a great feel and grip.  The keys are also back lit and the speakers on the computer are very loud and provide good audio  The one thing I did not like about this computer was the touch pad buttons (not the touchpad its self which is great) are combined under a plastic cover which is really hard to press down on.
Pros:
Best for the price
Back lit keyboard
rubberized feels great
Best single graphics card ati 5870 with 1gb gddr5 ram
8gb of ram is more than enough
Great processor
Cool unique look
and i can just keep going on and on..
Cons:
Touch pad buttons I find hard to press down on
Number pad on keyboard feels squished
Overall 10/10
And as I said before this is the best!

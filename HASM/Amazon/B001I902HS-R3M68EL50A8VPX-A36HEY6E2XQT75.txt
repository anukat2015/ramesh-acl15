Title: Great Vacuum cleaner
Content:
I was on a lookout for a dyson when this showed up on vine list. 
I was more than happy to try it out. 
 So first and foremost Thankyou Vine for the Timely gift. 
I have used cannister vacuums before and this one is a powerful version of the same.
 Love the long hose and wire. 
Love that that handle has the buttons to maneuver the vac on bare floors as well as carpets.
 Its fairly light and illuminates in the bottom to see clearly where suction is most needed. 
Its had soft rubber bumpers to protect both the vacuum and furniture.
 I like the little basket that holds the bags. 
The hepa filter is useful as my baby seems to sneeze lesser when i use this vacuum to clean.
 Attachments for upholstery, crevice etc are a great addition.
Overall a great product. I only wish It was totally bagless and moved around on its own to clean the house. ;-)

Title: Dog hair MACHINE!!!
Content:
We received this product as a wedding gift and my husband and I love it! We have a dog that sheds constantly, and it works great for quick touch-ups in between vacuuming. We vacuum our bedspread with it about every other day!! The suction in this little vacuum can't be beat. The power brush makes cleaning furniture and even carpet a breeze. The only downside I can think of is the lack of a charging station. We've used this product almost daily since receiving it over a month ago. Would buy again over and over.

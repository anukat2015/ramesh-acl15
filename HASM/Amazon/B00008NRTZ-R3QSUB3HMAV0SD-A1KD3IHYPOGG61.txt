Title: Move along, nothing to see here.
Content:
I purchased this machine because Bissell discontinued the Bissell Butler Revolution, arguably one of the best designed machines on the market and a great value at $55 on Amazon.  Although this one has a HEPA filter and power brush, at 4 times the price, it is not a deal.
The Revolution had a unique bagless/bag design which kept strong suction, as the bag would literally take years to fill up and clog.  Plus, unlike other bagless models, the Revolution had no filter to clean, as the disposable bag functioned as the filter.  When it got dirty after a year or two, you just threw it away.  This model is a HUGE STEP BACKWARDS as a standard bag model.  Didn't Bissell learn anything from Dyson.  His $500 machines sell like hotcakes because THEIR DESIGN IS SUPERIOR.
What is SO annoying about this clunker is that it is a replacement for a superior suction technology Bissell was already marketing.  This machine is worth about $50 and the Revolution was worth the $200.  Whatever marketing genius at Bissell came up with this should be fired and the Revolution should be reintroduced.
If a worse product at 4 times the price isn't bad enought, the design flaws spread to the hose attachment, which as others have mentioned, breaks and renders the machine useless.
Look elsewhere or buy a broom.

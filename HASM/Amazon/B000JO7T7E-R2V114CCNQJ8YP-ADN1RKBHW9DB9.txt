Title: IPod
Content:
So easy to use and add music. Had to ask my teenager how to do a few things on ITunes but could have read up on it done it myself with a little more time. Easily and quickly saves music from CD's to ITunes and then to the IPod. 
Don't care for the earbuds as they are too big and hurt after a while. Purchased a cheap headset to use instead. Found the earbuds to be expensive at $50 for original replacement but purchased headset for $12.

Title: Great coffee for a FULL pot - smaller amounts too weak
Content:
I coveted this coffee maker for 2 years before finally biting the bullet to buy it.  As anticipated, it made a delicious, hot full pot of coffee in 3 minutes.  But 5 days a week, I need only the minimum amount - 4 cups.  Despite getting the flow restrictor (which Bunn mailed for free very quickly), the only way I could get a strong enough small pot of coffee was to put in 8 heaping scoops - the same amount of coffee I use for a full pot.  That made my weekday coffee twice as expensive, so I returned it and bought Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless Steel  Now I push the 1-4 button on weekdays and get a terrific 4-cup pot as well.

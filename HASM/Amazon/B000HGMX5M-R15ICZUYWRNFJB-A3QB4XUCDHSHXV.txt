Title: Excellent camera!  The D80 Kit is Well Equipped!
Content:
My wife and I owned a Nikon N70 35mm film camera prior to purchasing the D80 and we have been very impressed so far with the D80.  We've taken about 400 pictures so far.  When you're not buying film you tend to get carried away!  The 18-135mm lens that comes with the Nikon equates to about the 28-200mm lens that we had with with our 35mm format camera because of the digital format conversion.  This lens is versatile enough that you probably will not need to buy a second zoom lens.  Most of the other digital SLR camera kits only come with an 18-55mm lens and in my opinion you would need to either purchase a more versatile lens or purchase a second zoom lens (55mm and up).  I also like the feel of the Nikon SLR's.  They are heavier than other SLR's but they feel solidly built.  We are using a 2GB SD card with the camera and it will hold about 400+ pictures on the high quality setting which is what we have it set on most of the time.  My wife scrapbooks and loves the ability to shoot pictures and then printout the ones she wants to keep for scrapbooking. 
I only made two additional purchases in addition to the kit.  The SD card (a 2GB Sandisk Extreme III which is one of the recommended cards for this camera)and an SB-800 flash.  The flash was somewhat expensive at about $300 but it does a good job and came with a diffusor in addition to some other accessories.  The flash also has a wireless capability that can be used with the D80. The built-in flash on the camera is very capable as well.

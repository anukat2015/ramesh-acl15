Title: Excellent for a cold office or cubicle...
Content:
This fan warms perfectly and quietly. If you close the door of your office, it gets down right cozy. And no worries about leaving it on when you go home because of the timer. ... The heat is gentle so you don't feel like you've been at a blow dryer.  I would even use this in a child's room at home because it is so safe. I recommend it 100%.

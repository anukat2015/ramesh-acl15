Title: Small, but very strong!
Content:
I read the customer review for this item, Nnnn very good, but still was not confident. So, I decided to buy and try it. That because of the deal at Amazon.com, was really good in every perspective, plus is returnable. Okay, click, click, click....I received the shipment in a couple of day later and started using it. OMG~~! I love this item! Small, but it is very strong!! My bed room gets super warm in a short time. A review from KY, got a heavy ice storm in 2009, and my central heating was broken from the beginning of this winter before the ice storm arrival. I was really lucky that I found this pretty heater, right before the ice storm.

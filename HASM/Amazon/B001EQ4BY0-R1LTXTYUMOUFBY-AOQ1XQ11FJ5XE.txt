Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
I have a Canon 1DIII, and was looking for a more compact second body. I was not happy with the prospect of either the 50D or 5DII but decided to give the 50D a try first. It's not that it's such a bad camera, it's just leagues away from the 1 series, and in my opinion, leagues away from the Nikon D300. Why do I say this?
First, it's not at all weatherized, which does matter to me as I do mostly outdoor shooting, and there are competing products from Nikon, Pentax, Sony, that are pretty well weatherproof.
Second, the viewfinder is small and dark, and there's only 9 AF points, compared to 50 something in the Nikon D300, and at least 11 in most other cameras. I don't need 50 points, but the little rhomboid pattern in the Canon amateur and prosumer lines is really sub-par for the industry.
Third, there's more pixels, but then there's also more noise, and fewer pixels would have been just fine, along with less noise. What good does ISO 12800 do, when the pic is unusable?
In summary, Canon has been resting on their laurels, made mainly cosmetic improvements in each iteration since their 20D came out, and I sold the camera a month after I bought it at a substantial loss on ebay. Good riddance, money can be recouped.

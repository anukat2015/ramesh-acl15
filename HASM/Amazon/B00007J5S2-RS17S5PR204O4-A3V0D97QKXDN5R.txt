Title: Better than the last Braun piece of garbage
Content:
It brews hot coffee in a short period of time... which seems to be a challenge for most brewers. Amazon had a list price of $120 and reduced to $59 which put it in the top price we'd pay for a no-frills brewer. It does what you'd expect it to and that was by far more than our Braun did before it hit the trash can after only a few months of use. Price is about the same now and we'd buy another one like it if this one pooped out.

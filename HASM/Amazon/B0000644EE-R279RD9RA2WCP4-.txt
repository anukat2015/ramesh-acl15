Title: Perfect except for the top!
Content:
The plastic percolator thingy on the top broke after a couple of months. I am trying to get a replacement top from Salton, but they have been out of stock for the last 4 months! My husband and I love the coffee almost as much as french pressed, and it's so fast! It's also the perfect amount for us. I don't want to buy a whole new coffemaker just to replace the top and not if its going to break just like the old one!

Hello,  I love this camera so much.  I was in Key West and the camera fell off the bed onto the tile floor.  The pop up flash is cracked a little and I am very sad.  Is it possible to fix it.  It was my fault,  I put it on the edge of the bed and the next thing I heard was crash!  Please help me,  I do not expect anything for free.  Thank you for your time.  Dawn

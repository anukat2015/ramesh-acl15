Title: Best MP3 player I've used
Content:
Fast forward is fast. One switch to freeze buttons so I don't accidentally change something. Easy to choose between onboard memory and the external card. Battery lasts a decent time in between recharges. The units software is pretty decent. Sounds good.
The software it installs on the pc sucks. It could be worse. I've seen worse. But it could be a lot better. I've not yet seen any mp3 software that I like. However, using it with the paid service from Napster works great.

Title: Love It!
Content:
I received  my Acer for Christmas. I love it. I wanted something smaller and lighter weight than our 17" HP laptop. The size and weight is perfect. It is much faster than the HP and it really holds a charge well. The keyboard is user friendly and with a cordless mouse it is excellent. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. The blue color is perfect also. Much easier all around than the larger laptop.I use it way more than I thought I would. Glad it came with Windows 7 Home Premium too. Excellent value for the price.

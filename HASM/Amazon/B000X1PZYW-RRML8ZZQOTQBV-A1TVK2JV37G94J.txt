Title: WORST LAPTOP EVER, UNRELIABLE, HIGH-MAINTENANCE!
Content:
We bought this laptop a year and a half ago. It has failed twice already. Loses the screen, each repair costs 140-180 $. It is undependable & unreliable, I agree with previous reviews. Very poor cost to value ratio. 
I have had way better experience with Dell & Toshiba laptops. I made a huge mistake when I gave HP a shot. After this experience, I would never buy an HP laptop again.

Title: best bang for the buck
Content:
This unit does a GREAT job at keeping my 1,000 sq ft home, built in 1924 COOL. It's already proven itself in 80+ degree days. I am bedridden quite a bit and LOVE the remote control. 
I have already vacuumed the easy to reach pull out permanent mesh filter. The exhaust hose was Simple to install and only required my window to open 4 inches and could keep the Screen ON!  
Haven't gotten the electric bill yet, but it works great. 
I did extensive research for a month before selecting this product. It's about the size of a dorm refrigerator. It's level with my nightstand and it's light grey color seems to vanish in the room decor.
Only thing is I wish it were a combo heater, too.  
Great Buy!

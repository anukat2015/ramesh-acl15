Title: Coldest A/C Ever
Content:
Haier HWR12XC8 12,000-BTU Window Air Conditioner with Remote Control
I bought one from Walmart 2 years ago. My daughter needed a new A/C for her room, she said her GE A/C was not cold enough. My Haier A/C was the coldest A/C I have ever owned. I ordered one just like it from Amazon and it was delivered in 5 days. It is exactly like the one I own ... it is the coldest A/C I have ever owned. We operate our A/C 8-9 months of the year, continuous .. without a flaw. It is the only A/C I will ever own.

Title: Samsung Software Sucks
Content:
Fine hardware!  Performs flawlessly, slim and light, solidly built.  I did upgrade the earphones, though the standard phones are fine.
BUT Samsung Media Studio REALLY SUCKS!!!  I have never been able to get it to work at all. I have to load music using Windows Media Player and/or Itunes.  Did I get a defective copy of Samsung Media Studio or is it just a worthless program?  Let me know, T10 users.

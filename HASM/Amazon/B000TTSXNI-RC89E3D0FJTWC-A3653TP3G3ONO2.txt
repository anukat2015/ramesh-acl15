Title: Love it!
Content:
I'm very happy with my purchase.  I turn the heater on before I get ready for bed and it gets my bedroom nice and warm within 15 min.  I'm able to set it to turn off after an hour so it doesn't have to run all night.  Then, when my first alarm goes off in the AM, I use the remote turn it back on.  15 min of snooze time and I'm ready to get out of bed in a nice and warm bedroom.  My gas bill is lower since I do not have to heat the house all night long and my electric bill hasn't really changed since I only run the heater for two hours tops per day.  It may not be the solution you are looking for but it's perfect for me!

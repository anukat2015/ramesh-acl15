Title: Refurbished 2nd gen nano
Content:
I bought this for my 78 year old dad.  I was able to give him a tutorial on use of iTunes and downloading CDs.  2nd Generation nano is fine for my dad as I suspect he will never load more than several hundred songs.  Very easy to deal with this particular retailer.  Product is relatively simple to use (after all, my 78 year old dad can now purchase songs from iTunes, download CDs and listen to them from his iPod) and he takes great pride in showing off to his senior citizen friends that he (rather than his grandchildren) can download and play songs from his very own iPod.  The compact size (and weight) as well as the lack of moving parts in a 2nd gen nano seem to work very well for him.  Wish the screen were a little larger (my 4th gen nano suffers from a similar malady) but, all-in-all a very nice purchase (and it provides my dad a healthy jolt of self esteem from being able to handle this product on his own-albeit with reading glasses.)

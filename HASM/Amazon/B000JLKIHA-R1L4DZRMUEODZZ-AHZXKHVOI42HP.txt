Title: Great except if you want to listen to music
Content:
As of firware revision 1.1.1, the 160GB iPod classic pauses randomly.  It could be twice in five minutes or it could be once in four hours.  It's very random and very annoying.  My music was ripped using a secure ripper and I don't get these gaps when I play the music through iTunes.  As other reviewers have noted, the sound quality is poor.  I describe it as murky or imprecise and shallow.  I went from a Sony NW-HD5 to this iPod (and from a lossy format to lossless format) and the decrease in sound quality was painful to experience.  It seems like usually the weak link in an audio system like this is the headphones or output device.  Not with this iPod.  The player is the weak link.  It's a music player afterall.  If it does nothing else, it should play music really well.  It doesn't do that.  My final complaint about this iPod's music playback is the loudness of the hard drive.  Apple could have chosen a hard drive that wasn't audible across the room.  These hard drives exist and a quieter hard drive would have improved my listening experiece when listening to the iPod through speakers.  The user interface is really nice.  The hard drive gives me plenty of room.  The size is fine.  The display is nice.  It's fun having the cover art on the player.  It just doesn't play music well.

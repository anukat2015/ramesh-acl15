Title: AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
well, first off, it is very reliable, the battery was good, i originally thought that the life was really short but after u buy it, u have to let it die first like completely use the battery then charge it to full, then it lasts for a very long time.....
i got a 16g but i think they should have had a 32g.
and as a lot of ppl said, u can easily turn off the shake shuffle and the tilt and go thro the cover flo..... but it doesn't just tilt u have to scroll it to go thro the cover flos.

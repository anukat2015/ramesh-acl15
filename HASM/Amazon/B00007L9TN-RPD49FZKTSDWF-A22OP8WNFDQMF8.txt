Title: A poor heater.......but it can be great
Content:
I purchased this heater for a medium sized bedroom with a large bathroom. Out of th box it performed so-so and a bit too noisy and it didn't do a very good job. I found that the front grill absorbs most of the heat output and gets very hot. The fan cools the grill making it a lousy convection heater.
I took the darned thing apart and removed the grill. Do not do this, as it will void your warranty and create a fire trap if anything gets close to the heating tubes.
Without the grill it throws 3 times more heat. My bedroom went from 64 to 80 degrees in a half an hour, and still allows the thermostat to function fine at a lower setting. I can live with the fan noise now, as the heater works fine in half the time.

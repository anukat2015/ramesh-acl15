Title: might as well take $99 and set it on fire
Content:
Got this machine as a gift, worked fine for about 3 months and then started leaking water from the top (like other reviewer said).  Thus began the period in my life now referred to as The Great Delonghi Debacle...  called Delonghi, apparently this problem not covered under warranty, but had it fixed anyway. Had to wait three and a half months for Delonghi to ship a part.  As if that wasn't bad enough, within 2 weeks of getting my machine back, it started leaking again.  Same part.  Same wait for another part.  Delonghi has horrid customer service.  All I wanted was a working coffee maker and they would do NOTHING.  The Caffe Nabucco was tossed to the curb.  And by the way, their toasters are awful too.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from any Delonghi product.

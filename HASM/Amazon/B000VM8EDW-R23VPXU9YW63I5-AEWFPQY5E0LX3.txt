Title: Terrible product
Content:
I bought the 16gb Sansa View brand new back in 2008, it was my first mp3 player purchase. I listened to it at work for my 12-hour shift and it was great for two months. Then the faceplate starting coming off and the music would go in and out. I got a cover for it, updated firmware, everything I could think of. I contatced customer service you said that it's just outdated firmware (eventhough I updated it the day before!) and try it again. Come to find out not only is the faceplate coming off, but the headphone jack is causing the sound of the music to go in and out!! Customer service said they would send me a special number to return it (that was back in November 2008) and I still haven't recieved it!! The customer service for Sandisk and the Sansa View 16gb are both terrible; I have since purchased an 8gb Zen by Creative Labs and a 16gb memory card and have never been happier.

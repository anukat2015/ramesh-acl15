Title: Everything okay except the display
Content:
Overall this would be a good machine.  Plenty of power and features.  The one big problem I have with it is it has to have one of the worst displays I have ever used, and I've used a lot.  It is kind of fuzzy and the contrast is terrible.  I have a 4 year old Dell laptop with a 17" display that looks much better and I have a MacBook Pro that looks fantastic.  Because of the display I can not recommend this machine and it has soured me on HP Laptops a bit.

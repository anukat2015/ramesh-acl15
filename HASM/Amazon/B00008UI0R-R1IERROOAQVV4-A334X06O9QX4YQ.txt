Title: Works great till minor problems or it breaks...then NO SUPPORT FROM HOOVER
Content:
I have has this for 1.5 years. Now the belt keeps slipping off 2-3 times per session, even though it is a new hoover replacement belt. After waiting on the phone for 25+ minutes the Hoover rep referred me to a service center. NO PHONE SUPPORT AT ALL. DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY HOOVER PRODUCT.

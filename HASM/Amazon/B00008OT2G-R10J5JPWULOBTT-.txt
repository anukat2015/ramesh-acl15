Title: Almost there
Content:
A great camera overall. I thought it would be a great transition from my EOS film camera with EF lenses. But sadly, your lenses WILL NOT work the same way. This is due to the sensor chip not being full-frame (35mm). Had it been, It would have gotten 5 stars. Right now, your lenses are less wide in angle. This really defeats the purpose of it being compatible with EF lenses. Too bad. Canon almost had it for a great consumer camera.

Title: The hair is gone
Content:
I bought this because of dog and cat hair; it works great.
I use to own a dyson and gave it to my daughter because I only have one carpet now.  I needed something inexpensive and with good suction; the Bissell did the trick.  It sucks up the hair as good as a dyson.

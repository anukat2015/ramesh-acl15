Title: Fantastic and Fun Camera!
Content:
I'd been debating about buying this camera for a while.  I have an E-1 and an E-510 which both work just fine.  I have a lot of lenses which means I'm not switching brands anytime soon.  I kept telling myself I didn't NEED the E-30, but then I got to see one in person and I fell in love!  It's the perfect size for me... a little larger than the 510 but it handles the larger lenses very well.  I LOVE the art filters - and the fact that if you shoot Raw + jpg, then you get the jpg with the art filter and the original Raw in case you didn't like the effect! :)  I might not use the filters that often, but I love having options.  ;)
I love the articulating screen - that was one of the biggest selling factors for me.  What amazes me though is the vibrant colors this thing produces... straight out of the camera I'm floored with how wonderful the pictures are.  IT's 100 times better than my 510.  I loved my 510, but this camera is amazing. :)  BUY ONE!  NOW! lol....

Title: The Best I've Ever Had!
Content:
I think the title says it all:  this is the best coffeemaker I've ever owned!  My place is filled with the smell of freshly brewed coffee in the morning and I love it.  I haven't had any problems figuring out how to use all of the "bells and whistles" (actually, I found it quite easy to use).  Great tasting coffee and nice design - so nice I just ordered a similarly designed Cuisinart knife set. 
I would say the only negatives are the fingerprint marks (a general hazard of anything stainless steel) and the inside of the maker (where you put the grounds and water) remains wet unless you leave the top open to dry.  However, I have noticed this with other Cuisinart coffeemakers as well.  I just worry about mold in these situations.
But, overall, like a said I am highly pleased with this purchase.

Title: Good little vacuum
Content:
The first one we received from Amazon was defective- the cord did not rewind at all. I received the replacement and as I use it I am quite pleased with it; seems to be a good little vacuum for our wood floors. I have no pets, so I don't know how it would handle pet hair. Only thing I don't like is the harwood floor brush, it has like a piece of felt and rollers on it, instead I would like brizzles, short and soft(like I had in a vacuum in Europe).  I do use the black roller brush for area rugs if I don't want to get my upright out and it does the job. The european brands are so expensive here, so I bought the Dirt Devil; it has good power,and it does the job.

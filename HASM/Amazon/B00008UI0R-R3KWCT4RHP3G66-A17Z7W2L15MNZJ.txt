Title: Good suction, somewhat cumbersome
Content:
Overall, the vacuum does an excellent job.  It is somewhat heavy and cumbersome because I have so many stairs in my house.  It does do a great job cleaning the stairs, by the way.  Also, the dirt container needs to be emptied frequently.  It's not hard to do, but just should be done pretty often.

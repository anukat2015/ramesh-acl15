Title: Perfect for the Solo Coffee Drinker
Content:
I considered purchasing a single-use unit for about a year before buy this Keurig unit. I did quite a bit of research as well. The price of the coffee "K-cups" seemed high in comparison to using a drip coffee maker with filters and coffee beans. However, I am tbe solo coffee drinker in my household, and I finally realized that compared to the cost of what I was wasting by throwing out at least 8 oz. of coffee each morning, plus the filters and the time spent grinding beans and cleaning both the grinder and the coffee maker, the single-use cups were not that bad a deal. I was a bit worried because reviews on the K-cups were mixed and I am a picky coffee drinker. I like strong, well-balanced coffee and I was fearful I would end up not liking any of the coffees available as K-cups. After weighing all the pros and cons and looking at several different brands and models, I bought this unit, and I am so glad I did. I didn't realize until I was setting up the unit that it had a 48 oz. water reservoir - so much more convenient than having to fill a pot or container every morning. The coffee has been quite good, too, and there is a huge variety of types and flavors, something else I really did not realize until I searched on Amazon for the K-cups. The coffee is served at exactly the temperature I want, quickly and easily. And finally, I am so happy not to have the whole routine of making coffee and then cleaning up afterward.

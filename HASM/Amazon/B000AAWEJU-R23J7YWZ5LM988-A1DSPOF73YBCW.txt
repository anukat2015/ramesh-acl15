Title: Good
Content:
This vacuum cleaner is great. I had a cheap, standup vacuum cleaner before, but that was terrible, especially because it was bagless, so it was a nightmare to clean that thing. This one is small, light and silent, even on the max setting (6 power settings it has). It also comes with 2 bags included already. it might be a bit pricey compared to the other brands, but I'm 100% sure that the price-quality ratio is the highest.

Title: Designed by dummies!
Content:
There was another post by someone one out there about a Bosch vacuum cleaner who stated the same title, and I couldn't agree more!  Whomever designed this vacuum (individual or team) could not have used the final product more than 5 minutes and then only on smooth, hard surface.  As the other review mentioned, I have had the handle on this vacuum break 4 times over a 3 year period.  Same place, every time.  In Bosch's defense, they have continued to replace the handle/hose (it's 1 piece) even after the warranty has expired, but all that tells me is that they know there is an inherent design defect, but they don't want to issue a recall.  Also, every new part I have received has been the same design so they are not fixing the problem.  When this happens I am without the use of the vacuum for 2-4 weeks while they slowly get my part in the mail.  Don't know about you, but the benefit of a HEPA vacuum is lost if I can't use it.  There are other design issues, but this is the main one.  Just to clarify, I am a mechanical design engineer, and I feel pretty confident when I see a poor design.  This is a poor design.

Title: I just simply love this computer.
Content:
This is a very special computer.  I love everything about it.  My Amazon experience has been absolutely wonderful with this computer purchase.  The computer has a full size keyboard and the full version of Windows 7.  Absolutely fabulous.  Can be upgrated to 4 GB Memory.  Amazon offers accessories when you purchase the computer - a bag and the additional memory.  I did that and am very happy that I did.  There is nothing that I don't like about the computer.  It is more than a Netbook.  But smaller than a full size laptop.  So light and easy to transfer from home to work etc.  It is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  Price is great also.

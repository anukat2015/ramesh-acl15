Title: Very happy with this simple machine!
Content:
I'm the only coffee drinker in my home, and I got tired of making a whole pot that just went stale on the hot plate.  I thought about pod coffeemakers, and settled on this simpler solution.  After about 3-4 trials with differing amounts of coffee and fineness of grind, I quickly hit upon the way to make a superb cup of hot coffee.  This is a really nice gadget. The coffee is hot and strong. Permanent filter works well and cleans up quickly (I haven't tried paper ones on this yet).  I like that it clicks off automatically, too.  The reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the plastic travel mug that ships with it is an ugly and useless piece of junk.  I would rather not have paid for it.  I put my own coffee cup in there (there's plenty of room for a tall mug), and it works just fine.  I'm thinking of buying a second one for my office!

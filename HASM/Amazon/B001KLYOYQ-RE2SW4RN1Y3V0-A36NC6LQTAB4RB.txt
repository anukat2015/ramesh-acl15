Title: Great vacuum
Content:
I like this vacuum very much.  It is small and light weight and has a longer than usual suction tube.  We have mostly hard floors and the attachment for that works very well.  Unlike others I've had in the past that just rattle over the surface ineffectively, this one actually works.  I have had trouble with the wand detaching from the tube part and the attachment brush doesn't pivot on the wand, but these are small issues and I have adapted.  Definitely worth the money.

Title: Great camera
Content:
This is fabulous camera.  I've been shooting for about 5 years and made the jump to the 40D from the Rebel XT.  There are so many great DSLRs out there from Nikon, Sony, and others these days but I really love the 40D.  It is a solidly built camera and the photo quality is superb.  I've been shooting on the 40D about 3 months and have no regrets.  Wonderful camera.

Title: Breville BK600XL Best Coffee Maker Ever Owned
Content:
I have owned many coffee makers in my lifetime but this one is the "cream of the crop" It not only looks good with its stainless steel exterior, but it functions perfectly.  Fill the reservoir with water, turn it on and wait a few minutes for the water to heat, insert a K-cup or even your own grounds in the included re-usable filter, and push the brew button. Hot coffee, tea, hot chocolate, or even plain water for cooking bullions, etc., are ready instantly.  Machine is very versatile, has built in timer for automatic functions, and will even turn off automatically, if you wish. Cheaper coffee pods can be used if the optional coffee pod accessory is purchased. K-cups can be more expensive than coffee pods but are easier and more convenient to use.  I purchased the optional pod accessory and found it to be a good investment. Pays for itself over time with the savings on pods vs. K-cups.  I found I can even cram 2 pods into this pod holder for a good strong cup of coffee. Machine makes a modest buzzing noise when filling the internal water tank for heating but this is not disturbing.  Overall, after comparing to other devices on the market, the Breville has more options. Not a cheap coffee machine but if you like good coffee and plan on keeping it along time, I think it's a good investment.

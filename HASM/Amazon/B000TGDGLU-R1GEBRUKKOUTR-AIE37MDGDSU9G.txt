Title: delonghi oil filled heater
Content:
I bought this heater for additional heat in the basement. We keep it set on high 24hrs because of the large amount of space to heat. It runs an extra $20 a month to operate. It definately makes a difference and keeps the area nice and warm. Definately would reccommend, Ive tried others.

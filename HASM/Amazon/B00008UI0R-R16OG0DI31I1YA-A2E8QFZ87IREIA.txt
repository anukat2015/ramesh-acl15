Title: great vacuum
Content:
I have bought so many vacuums over the years, they have all disappointed me in some way.  I have had this Hoover Windtunnel long enough to have tried it all over the house and I am very happy with it.  I am some-what disabled and chose a canister so I would have less weight to push around.
This machine is very powerful, it really pulls the nap up on the rugs but it is also simple to adjust the suction down to do drapes and area rugs.  All the controls are at your fingertips.  The self-winding cord is a little short but it is no harder to move a plug than it is to wind the cord every time.  I love being able to dis-connect the power head with one touch to suction next to walls or in hard to reach places and changing out the power-head for the bare floor head is simple and does an excellent job on hard floors.  I was skeptical about getting another bagless machine because of the clouds of dust and dirt you have to deal with when you empty the dust cup and the filters are always so hard to clean.  This is very easy to empty, you can literally rinse it out and the filter taps out and rinses very easily and completely.   It doesn't matter whether the dust-cup is clean or not, you will lose suction if the filter is dirty.  I would recommend this vac to anyone.

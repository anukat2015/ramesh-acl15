Title: Works good
Content:
I bought one of these at Wal*mart and have had it almost 2 years. I did notice the same issue with the water noise and I noticed that the room felt a bit humid even when cold. We climbed up on a ladder and and saw water almost up to the lip. Easy fix, we drilled a small hole in the back most part of the pan. low and behold no more paddle boat!

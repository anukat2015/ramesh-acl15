Title: Don't use the cup
Content:
This is a good coffee maker for individuals.  I bought it for my husband who drinks decaf and wanted his own coffee maker at the office.  It makes one large cup.  The coffee brews quickly and you should use a good fine grind.  Too fine of a grind will go through the filter.  The filter is easy to clean and never needs paper filters.  It can be difficult to pour the water into the holder because the opening is so small and on the left.  Coffee brewed into the cup provided with the maker is disgusting.  The cup itself makes any coffee taste like rubber.  Use a regular coffee to brew the coffee.  If you want a travel mug, buy a better one than the one with this coffee pot.

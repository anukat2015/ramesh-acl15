Title: Great camrea, great photos!
Content:
The D40 is an amazing camera for the size and price. It's wonderful in auto mode, but I was happy to see that all my really old, but very high quality, Nikon macro and telephoto lens from the 60's and 70's fit right on this body and take exceptional photos in manual mode (you'll need to scroll into the menus and adjust a few settings, after doing it a few times, it just takes a moment to switch back and forth). After trying my 55mm 1.4 all I can say is wow! I'm glad I didn't sell those lens on ebay! After messing around and using the camera in manual mode and judging the light for a few days, I was surprised how much more fun it is to use than just using the autofocus. I'm guessing most people won't care to use the camera in manual mode, but for camera buffs from the old days who like to experiment, it's a great surprise to see how versatile the D40 is. Bravo Nikon!

Title: I'm still freezing......
Content:
My last heater got overused and I got this one thinking it would be good for a tight budget because it supposidly saves money.  Well, you get what you pay for.  Apparently, the reason it costs less to run, is that it can't heat anything anyway.  I am literally sitting 3 feet in front of the dang thing and it is on HIGH.  Can I even remotely feel the warmth? No.  
I have a basement with very little heat from the rest of the house and this thing is such a waste.  Not to mention that if I turn it off but forget to unplug it, I think my room is on fire because I see this bright orange glow from the base light all the time.  I wouldn't recommend this at all. It doesn't do the job unless you are standing directly in front of it (within a foot or so...and no, I'm not exaggerating.)  
The bottom line: I'm out the money I bought this with, out the energy wasted on trying to make this heater work, plus I'm still COLD!!

Title: Great cheap heater
Content:
Living in a 1920's house has it's drawbacks. One of them being icy breezes when its below zero outside. I have modern central heat but why heat up the whole town? I did already have a sappy 1500w convection heater but all it did was warm one side of my ankle while drying out my eyes with it's noisy fan. So I shopped around for an infared heater. I choose this one because it a) oscillates, b) is silent, c) is 2 feet tall. I needed something that would go under my computer desk and keep my whole side warm, not just my ankles. I admit this does the job nicely. Crank it to 800w to heat up the surroundings (about a half hour) then turn it down to 400w for the rest of the night. I had it a few nights now with temps outside dipping into the low 30's.
Pros:
- It's like an electric fireplace. Toasty!
- It's cheap to buy and run.
- It is totally silent.
- It is tall, and with the oscillation going it will heat you from head to toe without burning you.
Cons:
- It's lights on high are about as bright as a 60w bulb, and on low about a 40w bulb. Granted it is a more pleasant warm sunset color light but it is very bright. You could never use this openly in a room facing you. It has to go under a desk, or at least facing a wall. You literally can't look into it more than a few seconds without going blind. This is why I gave it 4 stars.
- It's very light and fragile feeling. Don't know how many years of use it will survive. I think if it is knocked over a few times it will break. However I can't ding it for that until it actually does break. I just spilled a drink on it and it is still going lol.
Over all a good investment if you can place it in such a way as to not become blinded by it. :)

Title: BEST COFFEE MAKER EVER!
Content:
My mom has used these coffee makers for 25 years, she finally upgraded her 15 year old version last year.  Everyone in my family, Aunts, cousins and my brother have all gone out and gotten this coffee maker becasue they loved my mom's so much. I never new that there was a difference until I moved out (been out for 10 years) and I noticed how GREAT her coffee was everytime I went there.  I figured she was using some gourmet coffee but mope, she was using Folgers.  Even my husband was amazed.  I thught $100 was way too much for a coffee maker so she bought it for me last year at Christmas and it is definately worth the money!  It brews fast, I use it for hot water to make tea and hot chocolate.  You don't have to use expensive coffees for taste, any type tastes good.  Its not super fancy with lots of buttons and LED displays and timers but YOU DON'T NEED IT WITH THIS COFFEE MAKER!  You don't need a times cos it brews so fast!  It is worth every penny!

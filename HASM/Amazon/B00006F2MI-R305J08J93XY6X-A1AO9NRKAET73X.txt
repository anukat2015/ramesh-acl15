Title: A tremendous disappointment
Content:
The thermal carafe is about the only thing I liked in this machine.  
It is huge and awkward and difficult to load.  There are many pieces to assemble, and they become quickly caked with bean pulp which is messy and inconvenient to clean.  The brew basket drain valve often becomes clogged, which simultaneously causes the basket to overflow from the backup while leaving the drain open if the carafe is removed.
This morning, I mopped up its spewed hot coffee and grounds from my kitchen counter for the last irritating time.  I'm going back to a low budget Mr. Coffee to remember the little pleasures of using a product the does something simple correctly.
The only way this device would ever be worth $132 would be if you lived in a zone where you could pack the reservior with sufficient dynamite to blast the thing back to the architectural demon world which spawned it.

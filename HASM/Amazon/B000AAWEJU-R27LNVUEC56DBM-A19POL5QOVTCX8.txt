Title: My dream vac
Content:
After hefting a monstrous Hoover upright (I think it was called a Wind Tunnel) around my house for five years, I decided to try a canister vacuum cleaner. Consumer reviews on Amazon led me to the Miele, and I've rarely been as completely satisfied with a purchase. 
My house has both wood and tile floors and several large, thick Persian rugs. For these varied surfaces, as well as for upholstery, drapes, and more, the Miele is perfect. I can carry it out to the driveway to clean my car, bring it from room to room for spot cleaning, or put it to work Spring-cleaning my entire house; there's no job too big or too small. 
The best thing about the Miele is how quiet it is. My three-year-old daughter couldn't stand to be in the room with me when I used the upright cleaner, but she begs to use the Miele herself--and she's able to use it, too!
Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth every penny. If my Miele ever wears out (doubtful; it's sturdy and obviously very well made), I won't think twice about getting another.

Title: Too noisy, constantly turns on and off
Content:
I bought this heater a few years ago, used it for one winter, and now it's collecting dust in the garage.  The unit is NOISY... and the fact that the thermostat makes it constantly shut on and off makes the noise all the more noticeable.  Forget using this in the bedroom if you're a light sleeper.  I received a Holmes radiator-type heater as a gift and have been using that ever since.

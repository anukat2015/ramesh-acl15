Title: A great walking accessory
Content:
I walk everyday and have always wanted something that offered me both FM radio and the option to play my own music.  The Nano 5th generation not only offers both, but also gave me the extra bonus of having a built in pedometer.  What a change this has made to my walking experience.  I love the feature on the radio that announces the song you've been listening to.  I can then go home and order it on itunes for future listening on my playlist.
The battery life is good.  It lasts for approximately 7 hours.  The ease of operating the Nano is great, and I love setting up playlists that match my walk path. My little green Nano has become my walking buddy.

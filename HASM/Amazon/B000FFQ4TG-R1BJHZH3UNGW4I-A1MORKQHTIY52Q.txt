Title: Not quite what I hoped for.
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker to replace a Melitta Fast-Brew MEF2B (cone filter) for use in our office. After a week of drinking coffee made with this Bunn machine, the consensus opinion was not good. To a person, the comments were that the coffee made using our old Melitta Fast-Brew was better. The Bunn-prepared coffee was just missing something and sort of bland.
We tried increasing the coffee/water ratio, but that only resulted in the grounds overflowing the basket filter.
The coffee would come out somewhat better by interrupting the brewing by opening the reservoir lid after just wetting the grounds, pausing until it stopped dripping, restarting by closing the lid; this was repeated two or three additional times during the brewing cycle.
I would have just bought another Melitta Fast-Brew MEFB2 if they were still available. This was our fourth. They lasted a year or so with 8h/d use.

Title: Good Heater, worth every penny.
Content:
I have used this heater for about 4 years now and have never had any issues with it. This is still working good and I use it in our master bedroom almost everyday in winter. It keeps the whole room warmer. I have seen some reviews saying that the heater overheats & burns the power sockets. I never had any problems with this and would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a cheaper heater that works good for several years. One thing with this space heaters is that they put extra load on the power cables & would suggest checking the power cables, panels, sockets etc etc before coming to conclusions.

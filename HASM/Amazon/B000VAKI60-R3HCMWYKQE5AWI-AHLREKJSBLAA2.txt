Title: Sony NWZ-A818
Content:
stellar sound quality from the unit itself, which is complimented by the best stock earbuds that ive seen coming with an mp3 player.
pretty much standard interface wise, by that i mean that nothing stands out and nothing to complain about.
the only thing lacking for me is .avi format support, but that is easily overcome by conversion.
great screen too. looks better & brighter than the ipod when put side by side.
gotta love the volume rocker.

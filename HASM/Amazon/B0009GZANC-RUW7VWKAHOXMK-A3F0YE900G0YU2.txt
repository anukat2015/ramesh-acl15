Title: Great for the price
Content:
I just bought this camera and haven't been using it for too long, but I have yet to find anything that would hurt my opinion of this camera.  I took some shots at a family reunion, took some portrait shots, and some recreational shots.  I was really impressed by the quality of the RAW files.  I can easily touch up the colors on the provided software to correct anything I don't like.  I would invest in a different lense though.  I wouldn't say it's bad, but you can only get down to f/3.5 which doesn't make for the best portrait pictures.  I was lucky to already have several other nikon lenses.
As for the people who complain about the automatic features, you clearly didn't buy a dslr for the right reasons.  The beauty of a dslr is that you CAN do everything manually, so the picture comes out exactly like you planned.  The automatic functions are not the primary focus of the camera, they're just for taking really quick shots.  Also, if the colors are washed out, take them in RAW and bump up the saturation later.  Easy fix.
Overall, I'd say for the $[...] I payed for this camera, it's a great camera.

Title: Unreliable camera and horrible customer service
Content:
I purchased this camera 2 months ago.  It takes great pictures, however my sensors keep on getting dirty.  I treat this camera like a baby, and only use it in environments where it won't get damaged (in other words I don't take it to the beach, and never use it if there is the possibility of it getting wet).  The first time I noticed the sensors were dirty (a smudge appeared in the top left corner of all my photos), I immediately brought the camera to Nikon to have them cleaned.  They cleaned the sensors, and now the smudge appears in the middle right of all my images.  Nikon has refused to replace the camera, and I have to bring it back to their facility to be fixed (all at my own expense).  In the meantime they won't lend me a replacement camera (even though I need this for my business). Before purchasing this camera I was debating between Nikon and Canon, and got the D200 at a decent price.  I have a Canon video camera, and have found their technical support and service to be vastly superior.  If I could do it all again, I would go with Canon.  They're basically the same quality, however Canon has much better customer service.

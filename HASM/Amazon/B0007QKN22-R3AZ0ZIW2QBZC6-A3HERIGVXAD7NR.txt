Title: Great camera for beginners
Content:
Great camera for the great price. It's a good choice for beginner who still doubt if SLR toys are for them. Actually, it's a big step from SLR-like cameras, the picture quality is much better, especially in low-light conditions. It's not a brand new model, if you are not on budget, take a look to successors Canon Rebel XTi 10.1MP or newest Canon Rebel XSi 12MP or, if you don't want Canon, try other brands like Nikon and etc, which I believe also provide the same quality (for the same price).

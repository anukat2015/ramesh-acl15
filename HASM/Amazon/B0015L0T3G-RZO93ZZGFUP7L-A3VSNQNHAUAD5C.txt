Title: Happy with the Fuze
Content:
I've had the Fuze for about a month and am quite happy with it.  It's easy to navigate, looks good, good sound.  I had the small sansa M250 before and this is FAR superior.
I found it a bit weak in the bass and am learning how to adjust the settings.  This may be more my weakness than the Fuze's.
The one thing that really bothers me is the on/off switch.  I have a difficult time making it slide to especially turn it off, since it has to be held up for a second or two.  This has become even more difficult after putting it in the silicone skin.  The skin is quite thick and it's almost impossible to get at the little on/off slider on the side of the Fuze.  I'll upload a photo of this to help explain.
Otherwise, I'm quite happy with the Fuze.  I'll soon be taking a trip abroad and will be better able to judge this device after the trip.

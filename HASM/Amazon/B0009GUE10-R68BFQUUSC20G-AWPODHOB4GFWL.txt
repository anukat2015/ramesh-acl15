Title: The Best As Of This Month!
Content:
This is (so far) the best Walkman on the market.  The design is attractive and compact and the sound out of those comfortable headphones is just amazing.  It is smaller than the iPod and has 20GB of memory (do you have 13,000 songs to record?).  The interface is easily read and maneuvered and the battery (lithium-ion) lasts a long time and is swappable (mine goes for nearly 40 hours).  The price is excellent for this kind of quality.  It claims to have great 'shock' ability, but I'm not going to drop mine on concrete anytime soon.  The only thing that is missing is access to FM radio and recording.  Other than that, this little baby is the best on the market for the next six months at least!

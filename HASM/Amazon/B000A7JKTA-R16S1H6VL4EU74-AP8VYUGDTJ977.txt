Title: Easy-to-use SLR with fast, beautiful results
Content:
I received the Konica Minolta Maxxum 5D camera for Christmas from my husband.  I'm a long-time owner of Minolta SLR film cameras, and I was delighted to see that the digital Maxxum 5 uses my autofocus lenses from my film-version Maxxum camera!  So, if I want to switch back and forth between digital and film pictures, I can utilize my complete collection of lenses.  The autofocus function captures a sharp, clear picture even in low-light situations.
Unlike many digital cameras, the Maxxum 5D powers up and is ready to use quickly.  Even in extra fine mode, the wait time between pictures is negligible.  It recycles very quickly, enabling you to capture more of the action.  Also unlike most digital cameras, the rechargable lithium-ion battery lasts a long time.  My husband and daughter both have digital cameras, and they are constantly switching batteries in and out in a single photo session.  My camera's battery, on the other hand, provides power for much, much longer!  I took loads of pictures on Christmas day and still had sufficient battery power to take pictures on two subsequent occasions.
The picture quality is excellent, also.  We take pictures for a local animal rescue organization for their website, and cats are not known for being cooperative subjects.  The anti-shake technology in the camera combined with the rapid recycle speed between pictures allows me to capture an excellent photo more quickly and before the cat loses patience with the process.  For whatever reason, we have to do less adjusting for red-eye (or gold-eye with cats) when using my camera, also.
I couldn't be happier with my camera or the pictures it captures for me!

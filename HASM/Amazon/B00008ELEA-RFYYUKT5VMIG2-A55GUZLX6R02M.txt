Title: Too Hot to Handle
Content:
This pot is great if you like percolated coffee.  But, take the coffee chamber out immediately after it is finished brewing.  Rather than a warming coil, this pot re-percolates the coffee to keep it hot.  Leaving the coffee chamber in will make for a very strong second cup.
Other than that, this little pot is perfect for that afternoon or after dinner cup.

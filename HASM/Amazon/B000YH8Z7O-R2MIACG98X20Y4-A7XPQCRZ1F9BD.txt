Title: Does the job but could be better
Content:
First off, this coffee maker employs a springy ON button that turns it on and starts brewing (at least my unit does and the image here shown looks exactly the same as mine which I bought at a thrift store). However, after about 20 minutes it automatically turns off. That may work well if you are running out of the house every morning and dont want to worry about remembering to turn it off. In my case, I'm home all day and want a hot pot of coffee available when I want it. I cant do that with this coffee maker unless I hit the ON switch throughout the day.  The pot is stainless steel, however, the upper part with the pour lip is plastic. I believe this unit takes paper filters but I used a plastic/steel mesh filter from a previous coffee maker and it fits perfectly. The water 'well' has 2,3,4 cup line markers which really have no bearing on reality since a 4 cup cup of coffee is really just a one cup drink to your average person. I think the 4 cups equals something around the size of a soda can amount, maybe 14 ounces. To load water you must lift the top upwards, so if this unit will sit below low cabinets, it's not going to work because the lid will hit the cabinets or it will otherwise be a little difficult to do your water pour. All said, it does it's job, takes up little space and isn't too bad looking. At the $50 price listed, it's overpriced relative to cheaper models that I often see for $15.

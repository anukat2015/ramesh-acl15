Title: Works great.
Content:
I bought one of these at local electronics store.  It works just great.  My computer reads it just fine.  I have had other MP3 players and USB devices that would not work on my computer just like some of the other reviewers stated.  I think that is just a gamble you take with some electronics.  At first I thought mine did not work like in other reviews, but I soon figured out you have to hold the power button down a full 5 seconds for the thing to come on.  It sounds good, its lightweight, easy to use.  No complaints here.

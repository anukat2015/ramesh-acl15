Title: Powerful and nice but not excellent.
Content:
I bought this as a desktop replacement since my main computer is getting old (5++). Power hinge/barrel came misaligned but it doesn't bother me much. I'm able to play almost all modern games and it runs at pretty low temp (~55-60C). Fresh installed Windows 7 with no issues. Little bit disappointed on screen quality (compare to Macbook pro) but it does the job.  If you are a casual gamer, looking for a versatile laptop. This is a good bet.

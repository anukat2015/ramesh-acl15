Title: Better than the first
Content:
I have had this camera for about 3 weeks now and I must say I love it.  I purchased it to replace my older Canon Rebel 6.1 mp which I also loved and still do. (though its only a still picture camera) Its a great backup.  This new Rebel T1i 15.1 mp has many options but what I really like is the HD video camera feature.  No more bringing a separate video camera on vacation.  This is a perfect all in one camera.  I also bought the Canon 18-200 mm zoom lense which truly makes the camera and all in one.  Its a little smaller than my old one and a lot lighter.  The only thing that might not be 5 star would be the shutter sound.  It's kind of loud but not a turn off in no way.  Just have to get used to.  Having said that, once I shoot with my old camera (hearing the lack of sound) and then shoot with the new camera (more sound) I am finding myself liking the new sound better.  The battery is smaller and lighter and seems to last longer except when using the video mode, then it goes pretty quick.  Best to get a backup battery anyway, especially if your going to be taking  alot of pictures or video such as on vacation. I also purchased to San Disk Ultra 11 16GB, works great with the video BUT my card reader doesnt work with it. I have to unload the photos/video using the cable. It unloads very fast just a little inconvenient.

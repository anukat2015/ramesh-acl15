Title: Cooled poorly, constantly tripped the breaker, then broke
Content:
I was excited about having this thing cool my office... but then the hose radiated a lot of heat, the breaker on the power plug would always blow after a few hours.... then it just stopped working altogether.
I had hired a carpenter to install the hose in the wall permanently, but then he couldn't get over here for awhile - I'm glad he didn't!

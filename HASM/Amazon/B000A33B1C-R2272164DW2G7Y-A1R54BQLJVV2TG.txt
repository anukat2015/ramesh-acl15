Title: Timer is no frills and works great
Content:
The temperature controls are bit old-fashion but it's very easy to set the timers. What I also appreciate is the fact that if there was a power out the heater will work when power is back on, not the case with many other heaters. It heats our 350 sq ft attic fine.

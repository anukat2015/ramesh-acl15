Title: Excellent starter outfit
Content:
The 18-70mm kit lens was sharp enough for portraiture at its telephoto focal lengths. All-automatic exposure, focus and flash produced good results on many typical scenes. Both this lens and the companion 75-300mm kit lens should have numerically smaller f-stops, and so I bought a 1.7 used Minolta 50mm lens for serious available light work. Therein lies one of the Sony's attractions: Minolta A-mount lenses work in full auto mode. Sony's proprietary battery is outrageously expensive, but so are batteries for other DSLRs -- even so, it's wise to have a backup battery.

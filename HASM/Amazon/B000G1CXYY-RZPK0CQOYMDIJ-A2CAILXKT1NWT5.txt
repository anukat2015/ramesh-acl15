Title: not bad for the price
Content:
good little heater for under the desk. pretty directional, does not go wide, but does good job in about 12" direction. good value. i use it all the time when using desk at home in basement. good for drying out boots when coming in from snow.. have used it to dry small spray paint jobs, or for drying jobs requiring glue. only heats in area of direction, but will not heat up area around it. probably would in very small confined area like a small guardshack...cannot keep feet right next to it (too hot)

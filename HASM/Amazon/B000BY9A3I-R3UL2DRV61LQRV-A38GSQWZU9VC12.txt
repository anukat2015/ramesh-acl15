Title: Finally a vacuum I love!
Content:
My niece recommended this vacuum to me as I hated several that I've purchased!  This one is light weight, easy to use and has an easy-to-empty compartment. It's the first bagless vac I've used that didn't blow dust all over during the vacuuming and emptying processes.  I highly recommend it.  The only thing I didn't like was the way the 3 small attachments are connected to the vacuum.  I have removed them and store them separately as they kept falling off while I was cleaning.  I would prefer them attached to the body of the unit.

Title: Bloat ware makes using difficult
Content:
I bought a sony laptop for my daughter before going to college. It's a great computer BUT the (adware, bloatware, free trial software) is terrible. 
As an example the free trial  (Adobe pro soft ware)(a program that does not work till you register and pay extra) stopped her from loading (Adobe reader, (a free program)) My daughter needed Adobe reader to get homework assignments. So she had to go to the computer lab. 
I will not buy another SONY computer till they stop installing useless, advertising software.

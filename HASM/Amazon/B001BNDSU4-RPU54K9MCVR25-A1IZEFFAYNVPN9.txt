Title: Very Disappointing!
Content:
We have had this laptop for about 6 months. Since that time we have had to buy two batteries for it because the old ones died. 7 key caps have fallen off, some keys that we rarely, if ever hit, like the equal sign on the keypad. Also the AC adapter has gone bad and I have had it in twice for repairs. Perhaps it is just a lemon, but all I know is my experience. I would recommend another brand.

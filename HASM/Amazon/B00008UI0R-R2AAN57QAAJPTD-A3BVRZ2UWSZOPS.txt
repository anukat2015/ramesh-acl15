Title: Still going....
Content:
Bought this about 2 months ago. Everything seems pretty neat and compact. It works well until recently that the suction begins to go weak. When use on the carpet, dust or dirt seems to trapped in the pipe/tube of the vacuum and not into the collection bin. In many occassions, I have to dig out the dirt in the tube in order to continue using the vacuum. Otherwise, everything works fine. Still like this piece.

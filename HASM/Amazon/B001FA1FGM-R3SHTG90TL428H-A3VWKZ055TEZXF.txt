Title: Excellent heat source
Content:
We live in Georgia and have owned this heater for two years.  We absolutely love our Sunbeam heater.  It works well and really keeps our computer room and sun room nice and toasty, even when temperatures get down in the 20's.  Will even help keep our bedroom a comfortable temperature.  Covers a nice area (back part of the house) and we do not have to use the central heat system as much unless we are hanging out in the kitchen and living room areas.  I would definitely buy another if needed.

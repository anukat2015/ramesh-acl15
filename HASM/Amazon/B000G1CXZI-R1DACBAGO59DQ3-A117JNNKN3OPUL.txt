Title: Great features, compact size...too bad they don't last
Content:
I purchased this at the end of 2007 because I needed a safe, small compact heater.  I bought this at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, paying a little less than 60 with a 20% coupon.  It was a wonderful heater and did its job really well that I bought a second one a couple of months later.  Don't expect this to heat a large room, it's only designed for small rooms.  The GFI plug is a nice safety feature.  I would have given this a 5 star if I wrote a review then.  Almost a year later one of them broke.  I thought that was just a lemon, but then the second one broke shortly therafter (warranty was only for a year).  It's a shame because I really liked this heater, but I wish the durability was better.  It's really unfortunate because there are not many oil-based heaters in this size to choose from and price was not a major criteria for me(I would gladly pay more for a quality heater that would last).

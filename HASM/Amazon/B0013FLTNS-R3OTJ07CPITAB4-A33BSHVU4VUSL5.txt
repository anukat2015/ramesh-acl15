Title: Very happy with this buy
Content:
I bought my MBP on Amazon last July and up to now I am ecstatic with it's results. I have read extensively around the web for user reviews and experiences and although some negative ones made me frown I went ahead and bought one. After years of PC use and a lot of frustration because of crashes (especially with graphic design programs I use) I saved up the (chunk of ) money and bought the MBP.
I have worked with Mac's previously but that was such a long time ago that when I first turned on my MBP and saw the bright screen and colors and the power this machine has while I run heavy software, listen to music AND watch videos, it just blew me away! Apart from me being a specific user because of my line of work I think this MBP is also very suitable for less higher end user, although maybe the price could be an obstacle for buying one. Still it is worth every penny in my humble opinion.
Can't wait to see what the rumored new batch of MBP's will bring, and well hope I will not be tempted to upgrade this one myself. I'm a fan!

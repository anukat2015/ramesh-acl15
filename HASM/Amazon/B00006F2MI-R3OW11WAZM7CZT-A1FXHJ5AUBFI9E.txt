Title: Grind and Brew the best
Content:
I have read the reviews and wanted to throw mine in.
I love coffee, I like it strong and hot.  We drink 2 pots a day and this one works for us.  I have had 2 of these in the last 8 years. 
I would not go back to a pot that has a hot plate underneath a glass pot again.  It's a waste of electricity, this pot is greener.
This coffee maker has some inherent an consistent issues but I've tried them all (under $200) and I still believe that this is the best coffee maker. 
Maintenance: 
One key is that I got an extra grinder. I use one, and remove it and use the second one for our second pot.  
I see that many clean these every day.  I don't.  yep there's some grind residue in the grinder and when the brewing is done... it's sludgy.  Once dry it's not an issue for grinding.  
I wash the coffee maker and all parts once a week.  I unplug it and tip it over to the sink and clean it thoroughly. paying attention to the area where the filter door latches.  If that is not clean, the door can open during brewing...  Now that is a mess.
 I don't recommend dishwashing any plastic parts of the machine.  
I use a metal coffee filter nested into a paper one to cut down on grounds and such in the coffee.
I keep the coffee maker on a plastic cutting board that has a slant to it.  I note that I find coffee under the unit sometimes and this protects my counter. 
Yes, I have to wedge the grinder out 95% of the time.  I would prefer not to have to do this.  I am hoping the next one that I buy has had the design modified.
I love the coffee.  I do the maintenance so I have fewer issues.

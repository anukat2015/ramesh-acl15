Title: a great addition to our kitchen
Content:
My sister bought this for us for this Holiday Season.  We had been looking for this kind of combination for a while but had not found a satisfactory model.  The coffee tastes great.  The temp of the coffee remains hot for hours and on top of all that there is less mess because we do not have to transfer the freshly ground beans into a basket.  Clean-up is relatively easy and quick with a little water and the brush on the other end of the scoop.  Definitely a keeper!

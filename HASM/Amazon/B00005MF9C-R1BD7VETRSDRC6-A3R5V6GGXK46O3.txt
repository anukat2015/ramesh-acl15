Title: Gone through too many
Content:
Well when it worked it was great... I lived alone and only drank one cup a day at home so it was very convenient. However about 3 weeks after getting it the darn thing died on me. I called the black and decker number and they sent me a replacement. About a month later the second one died, and I called them again, and another replacement was sent. When the third one died I bought another coffee maker.
When it did work it was fantastic but it is very unreliable. I am not sure if they improved on the design since all that happened about 5 years ago but it is the same model number.

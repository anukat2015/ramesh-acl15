Title: I love this notebook!
Content:
It's almost as small as the netbook but has a much more comfortable keyboard and screen size.  I really enjoy the portability without losing the programs I like to use.  I am pleased with Windows 7 as compared to Vista.  It makes the Toshiba notebook I had feel like a desktop.  The price is great and I'm very happy with my purchase.

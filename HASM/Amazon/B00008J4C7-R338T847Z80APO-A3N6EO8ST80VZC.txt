This is the crappiest vacuum cleaner I have ever bought! It turns off by itself, clogs on the bottom, just carpet fibers of all things, without even reaching the cup. I've cleaned it, cleaned the hoses, checked the belt, everything, it works sometimes, and within 5 minutes it turns off, like if it's over heating and clogging. Where can I complain to the company at?

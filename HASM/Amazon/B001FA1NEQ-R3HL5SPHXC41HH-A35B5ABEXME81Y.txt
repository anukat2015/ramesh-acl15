Title: New Nano does not work with Accessories
Content:
this product works just like the older Nano's except it has one major flaw.  IT WILL NOT WORK WITH YOUR ACCESSORIES.  IT WILL NOT WORK WITH THE DENON IPOD DOCK, IT WILL NOT WORK IN YOUR BMW AND LEXUS that have Ipod connections.  IT WILL NOT WORK WITH YOUR BOSE SOUND DOCK and nearly all other accessories.  It will play, but it wont charge and wont turn off, so it runs the battery out and just sits dead.
the really infuriating thing is that Apple has pushed this device into the market as a portable music storage device and if you are like me, you have invested hundreds or thousands of dollars on docks for your home entertainment centers and autos.  They are really treating their customers very poorly with this move.

Title: 4 1/2 stars! Near perfect compact multi-media device.
Content:
I've owned 10+ well known devices. Far and away the new Zen is the best of the best. Not perfect, but so close.
Pros
- Sound is excellent (Sound quality above all. Zen scores 5/5.)
- Video quality excellent (Image quality amazing 5/5.)
- Size/Weight vs. features (A small powerhouse 5/5.)
- Features (Equalizer, clock, sleeptimer, etc. 5/5)
- Expandable (sd cards up to 16 gb supported 5/5.)
- Design (So well laid out. Nearly operable with eyes closed! 5/5)
- Non-proprietary (plays every kind of file or converts to one it will.)
 (Also, software included is good but not necessary! Drag & drop works!)
 (Non-proprietary gets a big 6/5! Works as a stand alone drive. 6/5!!)
Cons
- Buggy (Needs a reset on occassion. No big deal.)
- Battery (Specs say up to 25 hrs. More like about 10-15.)
- Screen scratches easily (Needs a screen protector.)
- Can't bookmark off sd memory (Again, not a big deal)
The Pros far outweigh the cons on this powerful device. I cant' tell you how much I've thouroughly enjoyed my player. I've been using it for about a month now. Easily my favorite player ever. It isn't perfect but its so darn close that to complain about its minor drawbacks seems criminal.
I watch movies, listen to books & music. I've even loaded family video on to it. There's just so much to love about this device. Thanks creative!

NOTE: This player is so, so impressive that I went out and bought the 16gb version and gave my original 4gb version to my daughter!

Title: Excellent digital system
Content:
This is an incredible peice of digital equipment and has more features than the space shuttle. It is most definitely a camera for a younger man however because it's HEAVY, especially with the 70-200 f/28 mounted. I can't imagine lugging around the really LONG lenses. I wore it around my neck for an entire day during a recent shoot and conlcuded that it would be best used in a studio environment on a tripod, or at least a monopod. I have owned several 35mm film cameras and at least seven different digital cameras including Kyocera, Epson, Olympus (2 different models, C2500L & E-10) and finally  three Canons: the EOS 1Ds 11.1mp, the Powershot G7 10.1mp, and now the 5D 12.1mp. So far the last two have been the best for my purposes. The quality of course is in the glass, but the artistry is up to the photographer and so far Canon has delivered the very best I could hope for. EOS is an awesome system and the 1DS, aside from the weight is one of the very best.

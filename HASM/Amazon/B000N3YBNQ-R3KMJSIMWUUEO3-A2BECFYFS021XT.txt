Title: Great Compact Vacuum
Content:
Powerful vacuum cleaner that fits into about 1/3 the size of the machine it replaces.  We are replacing a Hoover Self Propelled Ultra WindTunnel model.  We have found this model just as easy to push and pull as the self propelled Hoover.
The Electrolux does not have as many settings and gadgets as my older vacuum.  It does not have a hose and attachments, which is ok with me since I have a Dust Buster which I've used instead of the attachments for some time.  I personally don't like fooling with bulky hoses and attachments. 
It cleans much better that my old vacuum, leaving my 15 year old carpets looking fresh and clean.  It transitions easily from carpets to hardwood and tile surfaces at the touch of a button.  I have seen some reviews complaining about the length of the cord.  The cord is just under 20 feet (yes, I measured it myself before purchasing), plenty long for my needs.  And the cord retracts, so it is completely out of the way when being transported or stored.  
The best part of the design is the compactness of it.  It can literally be folded up and put away when not in use.  I highly recommend it to anyone that needs a very good vacuum that doesn't take up much storage space.

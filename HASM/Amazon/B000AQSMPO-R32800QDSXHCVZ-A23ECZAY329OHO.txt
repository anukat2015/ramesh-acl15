Title: Best Machine for Coffee AND Tea Drinkers Alike
Content:
This is a great machine for coffee drinkers.  I'm sure by the time you read this review, you've already read countless other reviews telling you that, and are pretty much set on getting it as long as the price is right.  However, what other reviews might not tell you, is that this is also a great machine for tea drinkers as well.  
I'm the only coffee drinker in my household.  For me, the single serve system makes great sense as it's usually overkill for me to brew a whole pot just for myself.  The nice thing with the Keurig system though, is that there are a wide varieties of other k-cups available too.  My girlfriend is a casual tea drinker (and by that I mean she enjoys a cup of tea...but is by no means a snob about it), and there are plenty of teas for her to choose from.  And now that Winter has started to set in, hot chocolate is fast becoming a staple evening ritual over here.  And in regards to hot chocolate, neither of us cared much for the hot chocolate k-cups that we've tried so far, but it's quite simple (and inexpensive) to use regular powder mix from the supermarket and just use the Keurig to provide us with instant hot water for it.  
As far as the pros and cons of the machine go:
Pros:
- Wide variety of coffee to choose from
- Wide variety of tea to choose from
- Instant hot water for hot chocolate, cooking, soups, etc.
- Very aesthetically pleasing.  Easily the best looking small appliance in our kitchen
- Pretty good sized water reservoir.  It's not as large as the B70s, but it's still not that bad.
- Extremely simple to use.  The hardest parts for us are still deciding which variety K-cup to try next and restraining ourselves from drinking more coffee or tea than is good for us.
- Availability of k-cups not only online, but at retail stores as well.  At first I was afraid that I would be limited to buying all my k-cups from Amazon.  And while I do love Amazon and their prices are pretty much always the best, sometimes when you need a quick fix, you really don't want to wait for shipping (even if you're a Prime member).  So far, I've found good stockpiles and good varieties at Kohl, Wegman's Supermarkets, and Bed, Bath,& Beyond.  Not only is this convenient, but it sometimes leads to that impulse buy that you can immediately reap the benefits from (as soon as you get home).  So far one of my favorite varieties was an impulse buy that I just happened to come across while grocery shopping.
Cons
- The "Travel mug-size" isn't exactly enough for our travel mugs.  This is one benefit that the B70 model has over this model by having the "Extra-large travel mug-size" as well.  While it's true that the coffee may be "watered-down" a bit and not as strong if using the larger brew size option, frankly, if I'm on the go and won't be able to immediately make another cup, I'd rather have weaker coffee than less coffee.
- It does make a bit of noise in between brews.  It's not a problem for us, but it might be if there's a light sleeper in the house, and they happen to be sleeping in relatively close proximity to the kitchen.
Overall, we couldn't be happier.  Our B60 is used multiple times, all throughout the day and was definitely worth every penny to us.  And remember, not all coffee is created equal.  I'm still going through the variety packs to settle on which I like best, and there are some that I really did not care for (I won't name which ones because we all have our own tastes).  If you don't like the first k-cup you try, chances are it's not because of the machine.  You just need to try a different one.  With the variety available, I do believe there really is something for everyone with the Keurig system.

Title: Long term update - not good and will be costly $$$
Content:
Long term update on this product as I have had it for under 3 years now.  the product stopped working, no power and lights flashing.  Took it into the repair and they stated the switch had shorted out the circuit board, a common problem when the unit heats up which this product does.  They want $145.00 to repair so it's out to shop for another brand and it will not be a Bissell product ever again.
I agree with the many reviews here that his product is of a very poor design and not efficient for what you pay for it.  I would not recommend this product at all.  I will now see how good Bissell customer support is to see what they will offer to repair or replace this poor product.

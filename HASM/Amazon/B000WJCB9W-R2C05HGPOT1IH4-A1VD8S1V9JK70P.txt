Title: For New MP3 Users
Content:
This non-technical review is for those who have not used an MP3 before.
I am a middle-aged woman who received this as a gift from a niece. I had not used an MP3 player before, and wasn't sure it would be useful, even though I am a great music lover.
After only a month of ownership, I use it all the time. It is quick and easy to set up, and provides great sound quality. The display is bright and clear and the sound quality is great--even the radio comes through static-free.
It took me a few days to learn the controls by heart, even though they are not really complicated. If you are already familiar with MP3s, they should not faze you. The 2 GB is really huge storage--most of my music fits on it. 
Since I usually want to buy complete albums and already own many CDs, I have not used the Rhapsody connection provided (you must pay a monthly fee for that service). Windows Media Player is free to download and lets me quickly and easily copy tracks and albums that I buy or already own onto the Clip.
My best new discovery has been books on MP3. I have never used other recorded books, but am really enjoying those.  
I believe this relatively inexpensive MP3 player is a great choice for new users, and a great product at an reasonable price.

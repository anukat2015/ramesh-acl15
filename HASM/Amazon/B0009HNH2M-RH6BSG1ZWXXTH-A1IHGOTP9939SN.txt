Title: Not worth the $$$
Content:
After the hose on my Kenmore broke, I picked up one of these locally. (It was somewhat of an emergency having 2 dogs, 2 cats and 4 kids :P) I really wish I had just waited for the Kenmore hose to come in...the Hoover S3590 was a waste of money and does not work well on pet hair. It also does not perform well on hard surfaces and floors. The attachments were a joke! 
I would definitely not recommend purchasing this unit...save up the money and buy a Kenmore! :)

Title: Thank the gods for digital cameras!
Content:
I shopped and I compared before buying. While the E-520 is not my first SLR--I have owned and shot with Nikons and Canons for many years--it is my first Digital SLR. I am very comfortable with it. It is sturdy, good looking, flexible and efficient. 
The main complaint I see regarding the E-520 is its ability to focus. That is a valid complaint. However...
First, every lens that Oly makes is different in its auto-focus characteristics. Yes, you will have to become familiar with each lens separately, but this is true of all SLR cameras and lenses.
Second, some lenses are better than others at AF. Most of the complaints I see come from birders, and they are probably using the 40-150 kit lens, or the 70-300 lens. These lenses do take some getting used to. 
I was shocked when I received the 70-300. It's a monster! But I have been able to focus on a wire 100 feet away, then move the camera and focus 200 yards beyond that within a split second; same with the 40-150 kit lens after a little practice.
In low light, I recommend that one ALWAYS focus manually. 
As far as the quality of the image produced by the E-520 (once you master the focusing aspect), it is spectacular. I have spent hours comparing images from the E-520 to those from Nikons and Canons. There is virtually no difference. (Check out the review and compare images at: [...]
If you're willing and able to spend $8000 for the top Nikon body (and another $10,000 or so for lenses), you will get that little bit of extra resolution and snappy auto-focus. But you didn't spend $18,000 for the Olympus E-520.
Is it fair to buy a $25,000 Pontiac Solstice and expect it to perform like a $160,000 Ferrari?  
The E-520 is an amazing camera. Period. Full stop. It's even more amazing when you consider that you can buy it with two kit lenses and add the 50mm "Pro" lens and still have spent under $1000. 
Happy shooting!

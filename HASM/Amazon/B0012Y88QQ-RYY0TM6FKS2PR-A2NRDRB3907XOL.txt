Title: Why not buy a 40D when the prices are so close?
Content:
You have the choice of buying a XSi for 800 dollars (body only) or buying a Canon 40D for $950. I can't see why anyone in that position would choose to go with the XSI. The build quality on the 40D is infinitely better. It has weatherproofing and a magnesium alloy body. It's shutter is rated for 100,000 shots whereas the rebel series has been rated for about half that (That means the 40D could last twice as long for 150 bucks more). It has a much better and clearer viewfinder; a pentaprism instead of a pentamirror. It is faster in terms of burst shooting and can reach faster shutter speeds than the XSi (1/8000 sec vs 1/4000). It also has a much larger memory buffer for when you take bursts of photos. The 40D can be pushed to 3200 ISO while the XSi tops out at 1600. This is a big deal when shooting in low light. The 40D also has longer battery life. 
Further, most people will never use 12 Megapixels. 10 is perfectly adequate. I can understand buying an XTi over a 40D. The XTi is half the price. But for the small difference the 40D is definitely the smarter buy when compared to the XSi. If the price comes down, then the XSi will be worth it. Until then. Do yourself a favor and get the 40D. Just my two cents.
My three stars are strictly based on a price to performance consideration. I'm sure the XSi performs great. Canon dSLR's are excellent all around.

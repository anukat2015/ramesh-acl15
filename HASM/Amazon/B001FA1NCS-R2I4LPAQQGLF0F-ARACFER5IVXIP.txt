Title: my new lime green nano
Content:
I love this iPod.  I have enjoyed being its new owner for a month now.  Have traveled to Hawaii and just returned last night from Key West so it has gotten lots of use keeping me entertained on the flights.  I downloaded an audio book and listened on my flights yesterday.  Has a good battery life per charge.  I find it very easy (having not owned a prior gadget like this) to download music and audiobooks to.  Today I plan on downloading an unabridged audiobook for my flight to Barcelona in 2 weeks.  
The ONLY issue I have is that it slips out of my hands very easily.  I have dropped it 3 times now which scares me.  I do wish Apple or ?? would have released a padded cover for this iPod when they released the product since I cannot find anything out there.  The end.

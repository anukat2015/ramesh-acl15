Title: It actually picks up dog hair!
Content:
Finally, a vacuum cleaner that works. My first was a Hoover upright - the dog hair just stuck to the rug and laughed. I surrendered and bought this one. It actually picks up the fur and the dirt that I swore was permanently attached to the rug. (This means the dog stays....) My only complaint is about the powered unit for carpets. It works really well, but it tends to roll the fur up into a ball, which sometimes gets stuck in the hose like a plug. Just keep in mind if your dog has longer hair - if it stops picking up, the hose is probably clogged - I used a dowel to pull it up far enough to pull the clog out. Still a great unit - it works just as well as Mom's [high-priced] TriStar.

Title: Great buy for the office
Content:
I love it!  I have a large office that is very very cold.  The HVAC blows cold air into it all the time, hot or cold.  I bought this heater and was at first disappointed with the size, thinking that the small unit would never be able to handle the space.  Boy was I wrong!  Each day I start by turning it on on high but then I have to turn it down during the day.  Works really great.  My only gripe is that I wish the dial would have temperatures instead of just an indicator that goes from warm to hot.  I had to find the "sweet spot" for myself.  
I recommend this.

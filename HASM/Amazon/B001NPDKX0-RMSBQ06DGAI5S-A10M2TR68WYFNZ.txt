Title: HP Pavilion HDX18-1180US 18.4-Inch Laptop
Content:
Hi Guys,
This is the first time i write my review on Amazon. This Laptop is incredebily good for the performance which i was expecting.
Here are pros & cons:
Pros:
True wide screen display.
The speaker sounds good.
Blu-ray player.
This laptop is designed for good ventilation , even though i use the laptop for the whole day it dosent heat up.
Battery charge life is also good.
Cons:
1. The outdoor use of the laptop screen is glare(light reflection make the scree not clearly visible)
2. Little heavy to carry, if you are a frequent traveller
Currently iam looking for an perfect fit Laptop case.

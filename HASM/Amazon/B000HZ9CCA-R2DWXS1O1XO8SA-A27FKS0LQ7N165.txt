Title: Love it!
Content:
Some of the funtionality seems awkward.  Althought this is my first MP3 player.  I really love that when you pause and it shuts off automatically, that when you restart it comes up paused right where you left it.  I wish I could listen to my files, at the same time I have it plugged in to my laptop for charging.

Title: Nice Laptop - Poor Support
Content:
I am very satisfied with this laptop so far. I had it for about two weeks. Nice screen - very bright. The HDMI works flawlessly. Speed is good and I got everything I was expecting with the purchase of a new laptop. 
However, Amazon doesn't tell you that the LEFT multimedia panel is an option to BUY. I did not see this as an option on the Amazon site. So I call customer support and did LIVE CHAT and E-MAIL. I through 6 agents before being told this was an option I had not bought. All the others were suggesting I do a full system restore (losing all the installed software) or sending the system in for repairs. 
Computer is good. Customer support is wretched!

Title: solid built, great value for the money
Content:
I recently bought the FW 501F and it is a great laptop for home and study projects, solidly built and with superb performance and capacity for gaming and browsing. If you do not mind the lack of BD player, this laptop is a winner, but amazon's prices for the same product are way above than Best Buy ($200+ difference). I already own a sony laptop FW 270J and they are excellent products. I would recommend this sony to anyone, over almost any other brands.

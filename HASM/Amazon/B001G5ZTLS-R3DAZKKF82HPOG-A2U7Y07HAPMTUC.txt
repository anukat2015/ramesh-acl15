Title: Best "ProSumer" DSLR On The Market!
Content:
I received this camera on December 1st and have taken almost 500 photos so far.  A mixed blend of portraits, scenics, novalty and still life - all are amazing.  I've used the cameras fully "automatic" setting - and when set to "A" - am most impressed with the ISO range and how little noise is produced at high numbers.  I've been a happy owner of a 5D for some time, and the upgrade to the Mark II is worth the money - believe it!

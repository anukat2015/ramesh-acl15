Title: Just got my perk !
Content:
I just received my perk,and made 12 cups of delecious coffee!I used about the same amount of coffee as I would normally use for my drip,just a bit more.The paper wrap around filters are worthless though,so I used the basket straight up.I can say that it's not "American made" quality (made in China),but had a nice retro 50's look,and It looks good with all of my other authentic 50's small appliances.If it keeps on perk'n ,I'll be happy with the purchase.

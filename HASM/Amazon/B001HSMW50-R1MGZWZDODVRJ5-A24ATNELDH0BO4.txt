Title: More problems than the old space saver
Content:
I was on my 4th B&G space saver - the first one lasted about 14 months, the next 2 about 8 the 4th about 6 months - the last one at least we didn't have to tie the basket in so it would stay seated.  I think the problem is the steam from the brewer gets into the housing that holds the circuit board and burns it out.  Anywho....yes I am a glutten for punishment I bought this because I didn't want to drill new holes in my cabinets ... well I had to drill new holes they did not line up (as advertised) with the existing ones - what a nightmare.  Also, woke up to the usual mess of coffee and grounds all over the counter - the basket doesn't seat properly!  I know I know 5 B&G pots ..... I really need to see someone!

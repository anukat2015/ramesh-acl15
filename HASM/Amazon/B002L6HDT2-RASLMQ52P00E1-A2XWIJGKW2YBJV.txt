Title: Avoid moisture at all costs
Content:
I have, for the most part, been a fan of the iPod line of Apple products.  That was of course, until this one.  While I have no complaints about the functionality, I have serious complaints about its durability.  This iPod has managed to lock itself near permanently b/c of slight changes in moisture.  Mere drops of liquid spilled upon it (I'm talking less than 0.25 mL) have essentially ruined this device.  I am very disappointed with how limited my usage of this device has been.  If you are an avid exerciser, don't buy this!

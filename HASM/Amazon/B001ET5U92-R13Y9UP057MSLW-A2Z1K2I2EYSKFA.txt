Title: I Can't Feel as Pumped as I Want :o(
Content:
Length:: 1:48 MinsThis was shot on a whim in the streets of Baltimore, after 10 P.M., using only the Nikon D90 camera, plus a 17-35mm Nikkor zoom and an 80-200 one-touch Nikkor lens. No tripod or monopod were used. Watch for the venetian effect of the lamp post, I think is caused by the rolling shutter (which is the culprit in the jello effect of objects bending side to side when the camera shifts back and forth) 
The video can't display the image quality since they only allow 100MB or less. 
Pros: 
Good tweaking of white balance
SDHC cards getting cheaper
Setting so ISO adjusts in-camera
Run and gun between video and still shooting
Cons:
Camera compresses video too much
Mono microphone
Low-quality audio recording
Lack of microphone jack
Lack of manual control in D-Movie
Jello effect when panning; Venetian effect when shooting bright objects
Only 5 minute maximum clips per recording
I wanted to try this camera to see whether it can record on-the-fly even though it has only a built-in microphone and no input jack. I wrote Nikon and talked with two reps before they unveiled the D90 about those concerns but they seem not to have a plan to upgrade any time soon. Yet other cameras like the Canon 5D and Lumix GH1 have mic jacks. It's clear that video needs sound, which is the most important thing; if your sound stinks, it can make video unwatchable.  So I now want to sell the D90 and try the Lumix GH1.

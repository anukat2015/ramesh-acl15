Title: Wow..Amazing camera...really mindless reviewers!
Content:
Well, got my Nikon, forked out the cash...and love it to death. Came in here and saw these reviews and my heart sank. Apparently, dad's with baby photo's, weekend warriors, and other such raters think this is a 'sling'ona shoulder' camera to take to the beach or shoot your kids baptism with! Well, news flash kiddo's...it's a pro cam with a pro-price! We make a living on these puppies and pay them off in time. Like many others have said...check out med-format equipt.and see where your wallet ends up. This is an investment! If I spend 8k on it and it earns me 300k...good investment no? If i spend 8k and then another 500. on my kids birthday...bad investment right? So, the moral here is rate it if you have it and don't get it if your bargain shopping. May I reccomend a D70 or something? Great little camera and plenty of power for the price. As far as the review goes..everyone in here has listed the specs and I agree! So, if your reading through, just let me again say...I LOVE IT. Great job Nikon!

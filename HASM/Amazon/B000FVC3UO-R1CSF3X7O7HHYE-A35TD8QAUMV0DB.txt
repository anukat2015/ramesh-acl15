Title: Creates lots of heat, but doesn't have much blowing power
Content:
Bought this unit last week to put next to my desk at work, but I haven't been completely happy with it.
The heater turns on and heats up instantly, but it is more like an open oven door than a space heater. The heat is there, but the fan in the unit doesn't have much blowing power... so you end up with heat for 1 or 2 feet in front of the unit but not 4 or 5 feet in front of the unit. I had it under my desk today and couldn't figure out where the heat was going... it sure wasn't circulating around anywhere.
The unit does put off a lot of heat... unfortunately I couldn't find a happy medium between cooked ankles and cold ankles.
I like the simple temp knob on top, but I end up leaning over to turn it up and down all day as I get cold and hot.
If I were shopping again I would get a unit with more than one level of heat, more than one fan speed, and an on/off switch so I don't have to unplug it every day.
Stay warm!

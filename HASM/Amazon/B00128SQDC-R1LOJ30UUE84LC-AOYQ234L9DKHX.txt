Title: features features...
Content:
This is my first digital slr camera, which I've had for about a month now and it's great.  Considering how many features it has its relatively easy to use, I just picked it out of the box and started getting amazing quality pictures with my nikkor vr 18-200mm lens. I'm sure it'll be only better when i figure out the more obscure details.

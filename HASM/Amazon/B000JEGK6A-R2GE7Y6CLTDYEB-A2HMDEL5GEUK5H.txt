Title: Nice and small
Content:
This is a GREAT small but powerful fan/heater, it is perfect for the bathroom and other small areas in the home. You should know it has a cover/filter on the back of the fan to capture the dust that always builds on fans no matter how you clean it, this time you can easily remove the cover filter, so I see this fan lasting longer then others I have had in the past. ;)

Title: Great Pictures, But...
Content:
It takes great pictures.  But controls & menus can be confusing/difficult, they are not intuitive.
Auto focus issues sometimes especially on Macro.  Only digital SLR I've used. so nothing to compare it to.
Despite these issues, it's a great camera & package.  I love it.

Title: Mixed review
Content:
The vacuum has good suction, but the suction adjustment feature is not well thought out.  Also I am disappointed in the way the hard floor tool attaches to the machine, simply by pressure.  It frequently falls off during use.  The older version uses a twist locking feature that has been dropped.

Title: Pretty great radiator heater
Content:
This thing, when turned on high, really does the job.  The only issue I have with it is that for the first couple of months the odor when it was turned on high was pretty toxic and probably unhealthy.  Not good when you buy it in the fall and need to use it often.  Once it (whatever it is) burned off, it quietly radiates and keeps the bedroom super cozy.  Love it.

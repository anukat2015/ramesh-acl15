Title: Rock solid camera.
Content:
I've now had the A700 for 8 months. Totally solid reliability, not a problem one. I use a Sigma 10mm wide angle and the Sony 18-200mm lens. The camera feels just perfect to hold. Image quality is of course terrific. The wireless flash system is great, with 2 H56's you can do lots of creative lighting and is fun to use. Complaint would be high noise level shooting in low light with DRO turned up, but of course just turning it down fixes it. Great high quality DSLR, I am very glad with the choice I made.

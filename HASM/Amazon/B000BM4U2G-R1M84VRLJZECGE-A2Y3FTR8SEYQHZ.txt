Title: It's okay....but Ipod is the way to go
Content:
I got this device just because I was sort of tired of all the iPod stuff and figured that there would be other cool things out there.  overall, it works..
PROS-
REMOVABLE BATTERY! iPods do not have this and if/when you battery starts to lose its lasting time, replacements for the iPod are very very pricy and difficult.  WIth the Zen microphoto, you can pop out the battery whenever, and buy a new one if needed.
VOICE RECORDER.  This is just plain handy.  Furthermore, it records up to 10 hours.
CONS-
The biggest problem, for me, is the SCREEN.  It is impossible to read whenever I am outside! 
Also, this is probably just a problem with my own, but the FM RADIO does not work! Whenever I turn it on it is always slow and hard to figure out how to scan for stations.  And by the time I want to quit, the whole device freezes! 
TOUCH PAD.  The vertical scroll is sort of unusual, and sometimes if held to long, it will turn up the volume very fast.
Overall, great for the price, but I would just as soon get the iPod...

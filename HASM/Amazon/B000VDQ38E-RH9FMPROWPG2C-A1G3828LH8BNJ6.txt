Title: Love it
Content:
We have 3 dogs and our old Hoover just wasn't doing the job anymore of getting up the pet hair, especially off the furniture.  So we have been reading reviews of various cleaners and didn't want to spend a lot of money as we have central vac also.  After reading reviews, decided to get this one.  Love it - we were actually embarrassed at the amount of hair that was coming off of our floor rugs and the furniture with this vacuum cleaner.  Would definitely recommend it.

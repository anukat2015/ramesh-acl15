Title: Canon EOS 5D Mark II - Hard To Find At Full Retail
Content:
I'm elated with this camera, which is my first purchase of a digital SLR with detachable lenses (not point and shoot).
As I was about to take a vacation to a far-off land, I wanted the camera right away. Yet the EOS 5D Mark II was not immediately available at full retail. By paying a premium over retail from a vendor using Amazon as a store front, I was able to get the camera in time for my trip.

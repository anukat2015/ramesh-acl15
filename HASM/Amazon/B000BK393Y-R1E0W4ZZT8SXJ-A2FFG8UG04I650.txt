Title: The best ever
Content:
I purchased the Evolt E500 Two Months ago and have taken well over 1000 photos with out a problem. The camera has many features for the pro and beginner alike. The dual lens kit can not be beat by price or quality its the best. I also like the dual memory card slots I have a 2gig compact flash and a 1 gig xd card and they both work great. The cameras menus are very user friendly and easy to use. I take alot of flower and landscape photos and just love the features the camera offers me. The usb download to the computer is slow be I feel that the images transfer better if done at a slower rate and less chance of some image loss. Olympus has done a great job overall I have tried out the Canon and Nikon cameras and they just do not feel as good in my hand as the olympus does. The weight and size are just right. I have heard a lot of negative about the slow start up time but I have not had an issue with it myself.

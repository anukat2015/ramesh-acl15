Title: Best thing since sliced bread.
Content:
I have had this for about a month now and I am glad I made the plunge into the high dollar coffee maker market. Bunn has no automatic burner turn off but with this unit you don't need a burner. We make about two pots of coffee every day and so far we love it.

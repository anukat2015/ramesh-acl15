Title: It's good
Content:
That little thing is good, it is not a miracle worker but it definitely helps to keep me warm when the heater does not turn on (thanks to my money-savers landlords).
The only problem is that the only way to keep it going for a long time is putting it in the lowest heat. Therefore if I'm too far away from it I only get air not hot air so it makes me more cold than warm. Why I don't set the heat higher?? because after a while it turns itself off and takes another while to get on again. In the meantime, i get cold.

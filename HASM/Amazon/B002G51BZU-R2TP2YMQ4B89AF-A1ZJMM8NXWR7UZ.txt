Title: Mr. Heater
Content:
I bought one of these from a local store. It works well and I got 4-5 hours of use from the 1 pound canister of propane. The only drawback is when I used it in my deer stand the wind kept blowing the pilot out thus the heater went out. If you can block the wind with a skirt around your stand it may help. I have used the heater in the house and it works fine and really does heat up the space even on low setting.

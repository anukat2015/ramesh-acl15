Title: Solid buy
Content:
I've had this laptop for a number of months and I have no complaints.  It's not a beast running games or anything but the computer runs great.  The only downside I have to mention is that the battery life isn't great (1.5-2hrs of use).  HDMI makes hooking up to the TV a cinch and Windows 7 hasn't had a problem yet.  It is a fingerprint magnet but most glossy black electronics are as well.

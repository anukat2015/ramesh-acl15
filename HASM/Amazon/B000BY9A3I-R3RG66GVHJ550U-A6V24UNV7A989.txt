Title: My favorite vacuum ever
Content:
I have bought a LOT of vacuums, and this one is my favorite of all.  I cannot speak for how it performs on carpet, only wood floors here.  The handle is so comfortable.  The on/off is right there under your thumb, and you can turn the power higher or lower as needed for whwhatever you're trying to suck.  It is very quiet, on the lower settings.  The main floor cleaning nozzle swivels with ease, to reach wherever you want.  The canister follows along behind you very smoothly.  It's just a really well designed and implemented product.  This is after three weeks of using it every day (moving into a new home and unpacking generates a lot of cardboard dust, etc., so I'm cleaning up often).

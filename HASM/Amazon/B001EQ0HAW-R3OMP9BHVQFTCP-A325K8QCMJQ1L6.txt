Title: Music while you deer hunt
Content:
Jeez, times have changed!  Years ago, I would hunt with a cassette player (later a CD player) and would have just a few songs to listen to.  Now I carry 7900+ songs and a couple of hundred podcasts in a package that is smaller than either of those old clunky rigs.  What I really like is the songlist feature.  I can stack hours of music and have a great hunt.  The battery lasts all day.
The only thing I would like is a "podlist" function so I could stack them too.

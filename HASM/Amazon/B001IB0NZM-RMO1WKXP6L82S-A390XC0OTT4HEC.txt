Title: need bags!
Content:
I purchased this vaccuum and love it, but now I am having a miserable time finding bags for this model. Can anyone help? I have tried ones on amazon but they don't work. I have even tried google searching the model number EP703 but come up with nothing. I have also emailed Shark. Does anyone know of any vendors with the CORRECT bags that fit the EP703?

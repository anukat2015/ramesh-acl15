Title: Good overall vac
Content:
I like how light this vacuum is and the fact that I can manuever under my furniture.  I'm a little unhappy with the attachments feature, they do not stay clipped on.  Also, I wish there was a place to clip the carpet attachment on the canister when it is not in use.  I sometimes feel like I'm going to break the head of the bare floor attachment when it changes direction.  It makes a clicking noise that makes me nervous.  On the plus side, the suction is great, the cord is plently long enough, and I like that the switch is on the handle.  For the price point, I would buy it again.

Title: A great digital SLR body!
Content:
This body replaced my original EOS 300D Digital Rebel body. It is a bit smaller and lighter than my previous, but is still constructed well. Aside from the upgraded CMOS sensor and added features, the big difference for me is the LCD display. On my digital rebel the settings display only filled the top portion of the small LCD. On the XTi the information actually fills the whole screen which a 2.5" display. For my 40+ year old eyes that have reduced near vision that is great! I now can shoot and adjust without having to pull my glasses up to see the shutter speed, ISO, aperture, etc.
The bottom line...its solid Canon quality at a reasonable price!

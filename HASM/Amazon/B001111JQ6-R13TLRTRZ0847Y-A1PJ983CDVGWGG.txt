Title: Great coffee maker
Content:
I'm pretty satisfied with this coffee maker.  The whole point of the thermal carafe is to keep your coffee from being heated on a plate and developing that unpleasant off-taste and odor that old coffee gets.  It is a MUST to pre-heat the carafe by filling it with hot water before you brew, it will keep your coffee acceptably hot (unless you like it scalding, which I don't) for hours.  I made a pot of coffee at 7:30 AM and when I got around to cleaning it at 3:00, the coffee inside was still warm.  
Pros:
Good coffee.  Really good coffee.  
Contains water filter
Comes with permanent filter (no more buying paper!)
Got it on sale at Macy's for $77
Cons:
I like my coffee strong - I prefer over 2 tablespoons/5oz cup and that filter simply does not accept more than 15 tablespoons - don't try it!  (If anyone knows how to take the lid apart to wash, please comment and tell me how).  But I can make a solid 6 or 7 cups which is perfect for two people.  If we have guests, I just make another pot.
Yes, it can be a little difficult to see how much water you're putting in, but I'm 5'5 and I can look into it from above and tell where the level is.  A better idea, suggested by another reviewer, is to have a container for water that's pre-measured.
Tip:
Do a few self-clean cycles, then one plain brew with water/vinegar.  It will help with the new-plastic smell
Bottom line:
It's a keeper

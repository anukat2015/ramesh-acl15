Title: A great little brother
Content:
I bought the D 80 body to lighten my load when traveling. The D200 is a wonderful machine but bulky. The D80 has all the important characteristics of its bigger brother,especially the bright viewfinder, and with the the 18-200 VR lens it is the perfect travel companion.

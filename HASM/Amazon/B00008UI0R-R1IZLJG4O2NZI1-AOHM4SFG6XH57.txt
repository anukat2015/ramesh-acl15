Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum 
We had purchased a different, upright Hoover from a store like Lowes and it was just terrible.  It sucked, but not the way a vacuum should!  I couldn't use it on the wood floor and it didn't seem to do much on the carpet.  It was heavy. It was around $300! We paid about half that for this amazing canister vacuum also by Hoover!  It is the best vacuum I've ever used.  The canister is light and moves easily.  I call it R2D2.  The attachment for the wood floor (we have a lot of it) is smooth and soft and does a great job.  The suction levels are handy and having the controls right on the handle is great.  The carpet/rug attachment works beautifully too.  I have been vacuuming 2 x a week lately instead of once a month!  It picks up pet hair well too.  The bagless canister has to be emptied every few times, but it's so easy to do!  The only thing I would change about it is that when you put the floor attachment on the end of the hose it sometimes falls off b/c it doesn't have any way to "click" on; but it's not a big problem and we can probably rig something up for that.  I even take it out to vacuum my car because it's so light and works so well!  I thought at first that the 3 suction levels were unnecessary, but I like the low level for vacuuming the fringe on our oriental rug.  I highly recommend this product!  (and the company should pay me for what I just said!)  :-)

Title: I love the Zune
Content:
I will admit that I am biased because I am a Microsoft junkie, but I think the Zune and the Zune Pass are far superior to the iPod.  I am still amazed that people are willing to buy each song for $1 when they could get 10 songs to keep and unlimited downloads for $15/mo.  Neither the small ipods or the zune 4 or 8 gb do anything that special other that play music and video, so it all comes down to the downloading software, which is where I think Zune really wins out.

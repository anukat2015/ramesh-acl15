Title: good value for the money
Content:
The Good: I was attracted to this computer because it offers a lot of value for relatively little money. (I paid $500)  Often I run several programs at one time and work with many tabs open in my browser window. I recommended it to my daughter and a client, who each bought one. 
The Bad: Where they really scrimped putting this machine together was the battery. It has a battery life of 40 minutes. I was with a client when it gave out after a full charge. Somewhat embarrassing and totally unacceptable. Because I often get wrapped up in what I'm doing, I don't trust it and now where ever I am, I automatically look for a plug in.

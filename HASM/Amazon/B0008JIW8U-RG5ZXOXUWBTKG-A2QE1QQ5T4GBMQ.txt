Title: Little thing is hugely great but only lasted 4 months
Content:
This tiny little coffee maker has great features for a tiny price.  It is very small and doesn't take up a lot of space.  Very easy to clean.  Makes great coffee.  I love that you can set the timer and have the coffee made for you when you wake up.  I also love that it has an automatic shut off, so no worring if you remembered to turn the thing off or not.  Great maker for the price! UPDATE Only lasted 4 months.....Maybe not so great after all.

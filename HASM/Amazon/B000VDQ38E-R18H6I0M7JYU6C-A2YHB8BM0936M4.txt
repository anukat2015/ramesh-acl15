Title: Amazing Vacuum!
Content:
I just purchased this vacuum after giving up on my 7 year old $100 bissel.  I had just (not an hour before) vacuumed the carpets with the old vacuum prior to buying this one and testing it out.  I was amazed and disgusted with what this vacuum picked up!  Since we bought this house 7 months ago, we found that if it is left closed up for even a day, it smells stale.  After cleaning the carpets with this, I was amazed to find how fresh the house stays... although it grosses me out to think that a lot of what this vacuum picked up didn't belong to my husband, my dog or myself.
The only con I have is that it built up a lot of static and kept shocking me.  Then when I would go to pull out the canaster a  bit of the dust would fly all over the place.
All and all a great purchase!

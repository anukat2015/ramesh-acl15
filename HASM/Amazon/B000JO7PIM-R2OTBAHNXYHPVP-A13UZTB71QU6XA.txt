Title: iPod 4gb Nano
Content:
This is my first iPod and I was amazed at how user-friendly, well-thought out and compact this device is. Since I use it every day I suppose it deserves 5 *'s. The biggest drawback is that the earphones don't shut out ambient noise, such as would occur when one is in a gym. So far I've simply been turning the volume up, which is not good for the ears. However, I'm in the process of acquiring noise-reduction earphones which many have raved about.

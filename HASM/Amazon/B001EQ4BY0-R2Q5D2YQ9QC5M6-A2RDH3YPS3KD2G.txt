Title: Great camera even when compared to 40D
Content:
Upon reading my way through every review I could find about this camera I noticed that a lot of people were upset about noise levels compared to those seen in the 40D.  As I was looking to buy one or the other at the time it was very important to me to see if these noise issues were in fact true or just caused by external factors.  Lucky for me a good friend has a 40D and a local camera shop was nice enough to let us borrow their 50D to snap a few comparison shots.  My friend and I took shot after shot using identical settings and identical lenses under a variety of situations, (low light, high speed, high light, inside, outside, dull colors and vibrant colors).  We then took the pictures, compiled them on a single memory card and displayed them on my 46" 1080P HDTV.  Results were very much in favor of the 50D.  Shot for shot the 50D either matched or exceeded the picture quality of the 40D in all but one situation: indoors with low light and dull colors.  Under that situation the 50D seemed to noise out on the constant color areas, (beige walls for example), while the 40D tended to noise out at the interface between colors, (at the boundary of a beige wall and darm crown molding for example).  Both developed noise but the 50D had more.
Overall though I was very impressed with the performance of the 50D.  It picked up a lot of details that the 40D didn't even come close to getting, (thanks to the 15.1MP sensor no doubt), was much better able to capture high-speed action in daylight and only produced noisy images under very particular situations.
I purchased the 50D.

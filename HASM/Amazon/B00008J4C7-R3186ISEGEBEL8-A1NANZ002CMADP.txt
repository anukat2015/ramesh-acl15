Title: great vacuum
Content:
I just purchased a Shark roadster after having a Kenmore for years.  I could not believe the suction power of this little vacuum.  It is obvious to me that my other vacuum was not getting at the dirt and dog and cat hair in my house.  Also the 
shark doesn't have the after smell of the regular vacuum.  I love the bagless part. Just wanted to let people know for a little cleaner it has lots of power.

Title: sounds like a washing machine
Content:
It looks great -- one of the best fire optical illusions I've seen. Heats the room well, too.
But it's so noisy I think I'll have to return it.  I'm giving myself the weekend to see if I get accustomed to the noise, but it actually is more noisy than my (extra quiet) washing machine.
It's possible that I got a lemon and just need to replace it.  Hope so, because it adds a nice cozy ambiance to the room.

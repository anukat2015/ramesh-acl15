Personally I love it!  dGpu for when I want to play games or watch a HiRes video and iGpu for when i need better battery life.  I haven't managed to deplete the battery below 40% yet :)  Only gripe I have is that the screen res and dpi are a little low for a 15.6 inch screen.  The UL80VT would probably be a better choice as they both use the same res.  Other than that, boots up in 40-50 sec and shuts down in under 10 - perfect for me ;)

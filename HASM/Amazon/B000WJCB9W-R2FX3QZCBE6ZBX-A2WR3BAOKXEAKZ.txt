SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Blue)
My mother is in the end stages of Alzheimer's/Dementia.  We are from a musical family so music has always played a huge role in her life.  She hums all the time, but because of her decline, her humming is nothing more than the sound of wailing and she 'hums' non-stop.  Nothing can tune it out. TV, radio, CDs, nothing because she is so loud and you can hear her throughout the house.  My niece suggested an MP3 player, I can listen to something relaxing while tuning her out.  Received my MP3 Player and it worked fine the first day.  The second day, nothing.  I tried everything suggested in the operating instruction materials.  Still, nothing.  I went to the trouble shooting website, and could find no solution.  I e-mailed support.  2 days later, had not heard back from them.  I assumed that their tech support would be like others I had used over the years, within minutes or hours, I would receive a reply.  Nothing.  Called customer support, and spoke with an individual that must have been in a race for time.  I can't tell you how many times I had to ask her to slow down and speak clearly.  Turned out to be a simple fix as the player had to be reset, but her solution was no where to be found in the supporting materials I received with the player.  After many man hours and time on the phone, I got it to work.  Finally.  It's been a month and have had no more problems other than the battery has to be charged from your computer, and it's designed for a lap top not a PC, so you have to stand on your head to re-charge.  Also, the clip keeps coming apart, fortunately I haven't dropped it in the toilet.  I guess for an entry level MP3 it's okay, but next time, I will do a lot more research.

Title: A good cleaner.
Content:
The vacuum was delivered in 4 days from ordering on Amazon.com. It was very easy to put together. I've had it now for a little over a month and what I really dislike about it is exactly what I read in the reviews about the dirt cup, and the length of  the cord. The dirt cup is big but you can only fill 1/3 of it, so I get 2 uses before I have to empty it. You cant just empty the cup and shove it back in the machine  you have to clean the Hepa filter and cup if you want the cleaner to look nice run good and maybe last longer. You can rinse the Hepa filter and use a small brush but I use My Husbands air compressor to blow off the dirt from the Filter and then just wash the cup out. I don't think that it will last long rinsing the filter as it is made of a paper material and who can afford $24-26 for a new one every month or so, but that's how the manufacture makes more money. The short cord is pain having to go get it and plug it in closer all the time,I do that about 4 times cleaning the whole house (one level). What I really like about it was what I also read in reviews was the suction, the clean air return, the  attachments for rugs, bare floors, upholstery. They all work great using the 3 different speeds.

Title: Best purchase so far!
Content:
I've done months of research on ultra portable pc's and found the AA1 to be the best value for the dollar.Whether your a Windows or linnux fan,this will fill the need for simple inexpensive computing.I've used Windows most of my computing life,but was curious about Linnux os.There's much to like about both e.i. the familiariy of Windows and the quick boot up and lack of a need for anti-virus protection for Linnux.With the inclusion of built in games,my kids love it!Once you get around the wi-fi issues myself and others reviewers have experienced,you will not be dissapointed.Thank you Acer for a great product!

Title: A good idea poorly executed
Content:
I really wanted to like this vacuum cleaner. I own two uprights, but they're both kind of clunky for vacuuming bare floors or doing a quick pick-up or dusting. At first glance this product seemed perfect -- lightweight; reasonable suction (I assumed); the usual Panasonic reliability (also assumed); and, for those of us who relate in that way to inanimate objects, it was kind of cute.
What a disappointment. The one positive (other than cuteness) is that it did a good job on bare floor. However, the relatively short power cord made vacuuming a large room less convenient than it should have been. The unit also had an annoying habit of rearing up on its wheels when pulled with anything more than a gentle tug. The supplied dust brush, with its narrow air intake, allowed for very little suction and therefore was virtually useless. (A standard size dust brush doesn't fit on the wand.) The unit also generated an obnoxious, burning-type smell, which is what finally pushed me into returning it. Amazon, as usual, was good about that.

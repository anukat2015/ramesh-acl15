Title: I agree with Drew M ...... the worst vacuum I've ever spent $300 on
Content:
Everything Drew (the single guy) said is true.  I would never buy this again, and am not ever sure that I'd feel right selling it used to anyone.  My biggest complaints - it tips over at the slightest hangup on a piece of furniture or doorway, the fact that the handle only turns one say (Drew is right...it's absurd...and my hand hurts afterwards from trying to keep the power nozzle in line), and my retractable cord is broken after about four uses..it won't retract any longer.
Don't buy it - shop around a bit.

Title: No 180 degree option
Content:
The description states that the heater has the option of 360 or 180 degree heat.  Apparently they've changed the heater to no longer have that option -- it's always 360 degree heat now.
The manual says nothing about a front-only heating option, and there's no control for it on the heater.  Compared to the amazon image, the heater I received is missing the little tab sticking up in back, and there's a rectangle on the back of the unit that looks like it might have been a space for a switch, but now it's just filled with a block of plastic.

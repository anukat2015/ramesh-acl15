Title: Good idea, but a bear to clean
Content:
I bought a factory reconditioned Grind and Brew a few years ago, and ignored a review I read somewhere that it is difficult to clean. I shouldn't have. Cleaning it is really a pain in the neck. Besides all the nooks and crannies where the grinds accumulate, the grinder needs cleaning after each use, as steam from the brewing makes a sticky mess of the grinder. Furthermore, be aware that the cup capacity is based on 6 oz. or smaller, and the coffee measurements they recommend produce a very weak brew. If you like a rich brew, the grinder might not have the capacity needed to make a full pot. I still use the thing, but wouldn't buy it again.

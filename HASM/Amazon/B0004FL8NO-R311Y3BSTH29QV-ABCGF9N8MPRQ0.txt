Title: Good Machine for the money
Content:
I wasn't intending to buy a coffee maker with a thermal carafe because I used to pour the coffee into one immediately after brewing on my old machine.  But after extensive research this one had a carafe and a reasonable price.  So far after three weeks of more than one pot per day, this machine has done well.  Its a little annoying to put the carafe back under the brew basket due to the spring loaded stopper for the pour-while-brewing feature but I wouldn't hesitate recommending the machine for that reason.

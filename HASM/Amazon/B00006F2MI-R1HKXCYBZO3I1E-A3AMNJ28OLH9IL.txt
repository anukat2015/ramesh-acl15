Title: Cuisinart Shmeezinart
Content:
Man...what a piece of junk!  Cheaply made plastic, leaky and unreliable mechanism...I will think three times before I buy another cuisinart item.  Cuisinart food processor is great, thought this would be the same, not the case.
Save yourself the trouble and buy a grinder separately from the brewer, or at least don't buy this particular grind and brew.

Title: doesn't provide enough warmth to help.
Content:
I thought this would be perfect for my office, which is always kept freezing cold. However, while it fits great under desk, low voltage etc, and the panel itself is warm, you can't feel any heat unless you are physically touching it. with it's feet it doesn't sit high enough to slide your feet underneath so your legs can actually be within an inch of the panel, I've raised it up on boxes on either side, so my feet can partially fit under, but still I freeze at work all day. not satisfied.

Title: Hamilton Beach 6 Cup Maker
Content:
I bought this coffee maker 3 weeks ago. I never wite review immediately. On the whole I am pleased with this maker at its price. I was going to by competitor but reviews were so negative on failure of electric on and off. I had friend that had 2, one small and one 12 cup for several years so I bought. I wanted to use ground coffee not pay 5 times price per cup for the little single brew rip offs. 
Ok most reviews on this unit commented on water filling. Yes this is very difficult to do. I have used a measuring cup as so small area to pour water into. I have not had any issue with water draining out of unit which was commented upon.
I also noticed that the case gets extremely hot. Yet you do have to hold case to push the coffee cup in to get coffee. This is my biggest compaint, case very hot to touch.
I was going to get a gold filter. Having had this unit for 3 weeks, do not do this. The paper filter traps grounds better. There is small filter in the drain to coffee holder but it is impossible to clean well or remove to clean. Yes can run water over it to clean. It generally works to clean but would be nice if easier to clean.
The coffee is good. Since only few cups usually does not burn. But since hot plate in coffee storage area it will burn. Do NOT plan on 4 hours as coffee will have burnt taste. 
I gave the unit a four star rating as it meets my expectations. I focused comments on things you must be aware about. The coffee is good, served hot. If drink in hour very favorful. I wish a way to clean the metal filter or replace. I bought at Wal Mart for I think $25.00 and am pleased. We will see if lasts for several years.

Title: The Wave of the Future:An Amazing Gadget!
Content:
This is a must have device for anyone who enjoys having a device that can do just about anything you can imagine. I have had it for almost a month now and nothing has gone wrong of note. Recording from TV is very easy to set up. The picture quality of Archos's beautful screen is amazing and the archos  is very small for what it does. Playing Mp3 is flawless while you can upload pictures you have taken to it and show them to family or friends as you travel and see them. The only trouble i have had with it so far is setting up the timer record function, you need to physically connect this infared cable to your vcr,tv or satilite box and then scroll through about 10 different signals and find the one yours uses this is very tedious and i have yet to utilize the timer record function due to this, i hope to figure this out veyr soon. Contrary to some reviews the battery life is very strong on this for what it does i have watched mmany movies and listend to hours of music before needing to charge it. Overall this is an amazing deivce and i give it a full 5 stars.

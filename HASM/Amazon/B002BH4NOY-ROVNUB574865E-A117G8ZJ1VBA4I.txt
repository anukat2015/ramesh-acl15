Title: 3-Stars = "It's OK"
Content:
After some searching I found this to be the lowest cost tablet pc. The tablet was just something I was interested in playing with but not required for my use. I went right to Windows 7 and after some driver updates the multi touch interface works as expected and the rest of the machine seems to run well for some development work and office suite use.
As a portable it is heavy, hot and loud.  The fan is probably the loudest I've had on a notebook and it rages up and down constantly. Very distracting while working and probably more so if brought into a meeting. I find the volume of noise from this computer to be it's primary fault by far.  I don't think I would recommend this to anyone without explaining the significance of the fan noise.
The overall performance is good, and better than anything I currently have so I am happy with that.  I'm sure for the some money I could have gotten a non-table that was light, warm and quiet.  oh well.

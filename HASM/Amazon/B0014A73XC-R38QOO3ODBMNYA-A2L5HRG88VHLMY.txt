Title: Nice laptop...
Content:
The laptop is very powerful and handles Vista with no issues. The wireless N works great! 130 Mbps with full signal ;)
The colors outside are Ok, I got used to them after a while, but the plastic shiny material is a fingerprints magnet. I still don't understand why they keep making the laptops like this.
I was expecting better battery life and less weight. I'm kind of disappointed on these items.
HDMI port works fine. Speakers are fine. It'd be nice to have a 3rd USB port instead of the Modem port (who needs it?)
Anyway, for U$S 900 I'm happy with the HP Artist Edition.

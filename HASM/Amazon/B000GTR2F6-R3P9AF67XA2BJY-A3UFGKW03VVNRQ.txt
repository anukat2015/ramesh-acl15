Title: perfect coffeemaker + electric kettle
Content:
I had spent a lot of time with my in-laws' keurig and decided to take the plunge. It's PERFECT for a single person. This version has the auto-start feature which I set to turn on at 6AM, so my morning ritual now is to make oatmeal as soon as I get up (for super hot water, just set to brew without a k-cup in it) and as that's steeping, make my giant cup of coffee. 
I had been torn between the "special edition" and the "platinum." I'm glad I got the platinum since it makes a bigger cup and has a larger reservoir. And the programmable auto-on is great.
I was worried about waste, but a k-cup is no bigger than the giant filter and grounds I used to throw out when I made one cup. For tea and hot chocolate, I just use the hot water with my own bags. Sooooo much faster than the kettle on the stove.

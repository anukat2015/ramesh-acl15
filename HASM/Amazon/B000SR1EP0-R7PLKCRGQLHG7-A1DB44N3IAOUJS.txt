Title: Great Portable Air Conditioner for the Price
Content:
I bought this unit not too long ago to cool a small bedroom in my apartment and it works fine.  I think a lot of people expect too much out of portable units.  The truth is that these air conditioners aren't designed to completely replace a window or central cooling unit; they're really only used for spot or supplemental cooling.  Also, it's important to note that you have to purchase a unit that can sufficiently handle your square footage.  I called Air-n-water and one of their customer service representatives told me that this model would realistically cover areas up to 200 square feet.  Given that my bedroom was about this size, it's worked fine.  The heater function is also nice for the winter.  Overall, I was satisfied with this portable AC.

Title: Great Hoover
Content:
I am embarrassed to say that I had no idea how dirty my carpets were....I have been using a Hoover canister vacuum for many, many years, until one day it simply died.  When I purchased this new Hoover, I realized my old vacuum hadn't been doing much of a job for quite some time.  This bagless model is wonderful...it really, REALLY cleans..the wide attachment for wood floors covers a large area so quickly and gets under all the furniture.  The attachment for carpets works very well.  I wish the dirt cup were a little larger, but other than that, I have no complaints.  After washing the filter and waiting for it to dry before I could use it again, I decided to purchase a second filter.  I highly recommend it and it had a very good review in Consumer Report magazine.

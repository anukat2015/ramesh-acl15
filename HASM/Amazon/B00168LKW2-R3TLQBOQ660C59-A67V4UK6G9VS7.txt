Title: "No drip" is not true.  I wish they provided a way to remove the water other than letting it leak
Content:
Before I buy products I use the trusty Amazon website.  This was the only exception with this product as I went ahead and bought it after reading the reviews but thought that the leaking couldn't happen to me as I wouldn't think I'd get a defective unit.  Well, lesson learned!  Mine leaks all the time.  We had to buy a siphon and a washing machine tray for it, spending more money.  Too much work and not acceptable.  I'll be returning it the store.  Shame on DeLonghi for claiming "no drip" when that is simply not true.  I wish they had just done the honest thing and make it where there is a small basin that is removable to put the water in.  I would have accepted that.  But too late and shame again!  Will be returning the product tomorrow after the last 4 weeks of leaking when I only bought it 2 months ago.
Please save your money and buy from a company that does not make false claims.

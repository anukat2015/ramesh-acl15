Title: Unit stopped working after one season
Content:
Like many others, we also purchased this unit at Target over a year ago and used it for about four months last season.  It warmed our bedroom very well and the digital features were convenient.  A few weeks into this season however, the unit has appeared to burn out - and does not turn on at all.  Without a receipt, Target is not taking responsibility and we have contacted Honeywell directly and are awaiting response.  Hopefully, their customer service is more reliable than their product.

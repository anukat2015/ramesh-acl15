Title: A piece of Chinese Junk.
Content:
Here is a good example of the junk we are being flooded with from China.  It failed after seven nights usage.  Its three year warranty costs more that the unit itself.  A real rip off.  Further there is no UL stamp on the unit.
Amazon should be ashamed to represent this company Optimus Enterprises.

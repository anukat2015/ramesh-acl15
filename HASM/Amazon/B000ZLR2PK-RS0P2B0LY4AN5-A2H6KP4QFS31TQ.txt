Title: Pretty good for the money
Content:
I've had two of these for a few years. I bought them at the same time from a Sears surplus store. The power switch broke on one of them after maybe two years. "One of these days" I'll fix it. The other is still working OK.
These have a surprising amount of power and do a good job of sweeping. They are relatively compact and light weight. One consequence of the light weight is construction that is less than industrial strength in some spots, so the still working sweeper I have is showing its age. But, considering the price, I think that is to be expected.
Replacing the power head belt might be a challenge for those who have little mechanical ability. However, the power head uses a standard Royal #4 belt which you can get replaced at just about any commercial janitor supply.

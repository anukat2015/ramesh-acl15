Title: Pefect replacment laptop for work
Content:
This was my fist low end cpu product i bought. The keyboard, screen size, battery life, cpu power are appropriate to browse and do regular work. I removed the virus software and the hulu and youtube hd seem to work ok but not perfect. The processor is definitely slower than the standard laptop. So expect a slowness in the response. 
The product is very good and I think installing windows 7 will help improve the performance on the video delivery. Further I tried with multi monitors (24" and 17") together and it works great. 
I would recommend this laptop for anyone who wants a laptop in addition to their desktop and would like to showoff at work. The full size keyboard is just perfect for fast typing and taking notes.
Six hour battery life is very good. I charge it every night and it just comes for the whole day. Whenever I dont use it, the save mode just takes the machine into hibernate mode. Just like a cell phone. Perfect.
Five star

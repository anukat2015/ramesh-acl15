Title: I love my Rebel!
Content:
A beautiful camera that takes stunning photos! The Rebel XT allows me to work in my "dumb" mode, taking over most of the work when I am too busy to fiddle with settings. It also allows me to be wonderfully creative with its Aperture and Time priority modes. my favorites pre-setting allows me to use the flash, but keep then shutter open to allow backgrounds to show up more realistically. Great when snapping pix of the marching band at a football game or a downtown night scene.
The camera's zoom setting lets me get closeup into photos I have shot. And a camera-to-TV cable that lets me shows pics immediately. The Rebel XT is very intuitive with features that I plan to grow into. It's a terrific camera all around that lets me focus on composition, especially at family events when it's about the celebration -- not the camera! 
I love it!

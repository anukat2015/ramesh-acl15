Title: Good heat, but a little too bright.
Content:
Produces nice, quiet heat, but the unit is really, really bright.  I originally bought this for my home, but it was too bright.  It works well in my office, which is about 15' x 15'.  Overall, a fairly decent product if you don't mind the extra light it puts out.

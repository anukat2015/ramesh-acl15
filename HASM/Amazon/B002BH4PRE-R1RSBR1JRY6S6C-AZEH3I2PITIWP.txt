Title: Great Laptop
Content:
This laptop is everything I wanted in a desktop replacement.  Large clear screen Full keyboard, high quality graphics and sound and loads of inputs.  I also purchased the XB4 laptop docking station, complete with all the necessary inputs and its own built in Altec Lansing sound.  Only one cable is connected to the laptop, everything else connects into the docking station.
Along with a wireless keyboard and mouse, I have the complete desktop replacement.  No problems with either piece of equipment.

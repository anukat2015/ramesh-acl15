Title: more than I expected
Content:
I avoided buying an ipod for so long, thought they were overpriced and overrated.   But, I finally just got one because I was tired of fussing with compatibility with other mp3's.  This is so great, user friendly, and well supported.  It's easy to work out any problem you might encounter, and easy to work the library.  Love it, use it every day.

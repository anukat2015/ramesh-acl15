Title: MacBook much improved over its iBook predecessor!
Content:
The major things improved that I noticed:
- Magnetic power plug.  The non-magnetic version was very vulnerable to breakage, resulting in a motherboard that required replacement.
- LED screen.  Vastly improved display quality.
- Reduced heat.
- Magnetic lid latch.  The old hook style latch was prone to wear and would eventually fail.
- Graphics process performance is much improved.  The litmus test for me was World of Warcraft.
The real test is to see how this laptop holds up after a year.  For me, the one-year mark is when these devices tend to show their ability to stand up to daily use.

Title: Remarkable
Content:
I've had this laptop for close to three months now, and I have to say that it's a truly remarkable innovation.  The aesthetics, of course, are perfect, but that's just the beginning.  After using OS X (though this might be a separate review) it is virtually impossible to be satisfied using Windows, although I've used Windows all my life.  I've had very few problems with this laptop, and those that I did have I fixed easily.  I highly recommend it.

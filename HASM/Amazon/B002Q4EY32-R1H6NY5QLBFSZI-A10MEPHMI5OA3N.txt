Title: Works as intended & looks good.
Content:
This was ordered for our office largely because of the glass pitcher & attractive appearance. For anyone looking for an ice tea brewer, I recommend spending the extra few dollars for any item with a glass pitcher as the plastic ones just dont hold up as well. The plastic versions get stained easily & are very easy to scratch while cleaning. (Same thing as the plastic blender pitchers, they just look awful after a few cleanings). Another plus is how attractive it looks on the countertop with our other black & stainless steel kitchen accessories. 
This unit works well & cleans up easily. If I have any gripe, it "feels" a bit cheaper then the cost suggests.

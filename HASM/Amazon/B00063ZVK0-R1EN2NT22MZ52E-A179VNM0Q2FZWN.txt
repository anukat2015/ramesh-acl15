Title: Vornado EH1-0028-06 DVH Heater
Content:
We needed a heater to warm our 400 sq ft insulated garage space.  We looked at many before choosing the Vornado.  Glad we chose it.  We have had it for several months and it has worked great so far.  The digital thermostat works very well and this little heater warms the whole garage to the set point in less than 1 hour.  While this heater would not be adequate for an un-insulated garage, it keeps our insulated garage 30 to 40 degrees warmer than the outside temperature.  On several recent 20 degree days, we were able to keep it 60 degrees in the garage.  We can highly recommend this heater.

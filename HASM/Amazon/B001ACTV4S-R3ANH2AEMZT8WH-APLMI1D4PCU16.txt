Title: frostyyy
Content:
I've owned and used several portable air conditioners over the years and I'm truly surprised at the speed of innovation over the last several years. Now it has come to a point where portable units have moved beyond your functional clunky beige contraption to something that has been designed to subtly blend into the surroundings. After deciding between this and a Delonghi (yes, I've finally arrived now that I can afford high-end appliances!) I decided to go with the more compact unit that was at a more affordable price point. I've been using this for about a month now and have been completely satisfied with nearly all aspects. One little gripe that I have, is the absence of handles on the side, it definitely is heavy too. It does however churn out very very cold air, look extremely slick and is a snap to use.  The remote control has a myriad of functions that I will eventually use one day but for now, I just need the icey relief from a hot spring day.

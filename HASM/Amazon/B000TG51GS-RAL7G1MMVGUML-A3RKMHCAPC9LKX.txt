Title: almost perfect
Content:
perfect temperature settings, timer. Auto mode is a little wacky, it maintains the temperature but it turns off/on way too much - better off with the timer. Very safe! around kids/cats (no burns) but the hard plastic vibrates on hardwood flooring a lot (easily solved with anything soft such as pot holder/dishcloth).

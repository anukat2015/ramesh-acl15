Title: Great little heater even if not perfect
Content:
I inherited this heater and admit that I wanted it for sentimental value but I love it now! Having the ability to target a particular temperature is great, I wouldn't want a heater without that feature. What I would like is the ability to point the airstream up or down in addition to swiveling on the base. It is wonderfully light and compact and feels very safe. Though looks aren't important to me this little unit is more attractive than many others I've seen.

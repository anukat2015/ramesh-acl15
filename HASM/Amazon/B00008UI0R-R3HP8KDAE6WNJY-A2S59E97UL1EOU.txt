Title: This vacuum is TERRIFIC!!
Content:
I have never written a product review before, but I felt compelled to finally give a good product its due credit.  I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.  First, the vacuum is very powerful, on hard floors and carpet.  Contrary to some reviews, mine DID come with a hard floor brush which I prefer over using the carpet attachment.
Although some complain about bagless being dirty, it couldn't be simpler, really.  I go in the garage and empty it into a shopping bag.  I don't shake it hard, so there's no dust or dirt.  I then rinse the container under water and leave it to dry. The whole thing takes 2 minutes or less, and you never have to worry about buying OVERPRICED bags.
The vacuum is light and portable - it comes with a large handle and is very easy to carry around to different rooms.  It also has large wheels, so it glides easily over bumps, etc.
The electric carpet brush is simple to attach, and even comes with a foot petal to release and remove.
Lastly, the vacuum isn't noisy.
I researched a lot of vacuums, almost to the point of driving myself crazy! Just buy it - you won't regret this purchase!!

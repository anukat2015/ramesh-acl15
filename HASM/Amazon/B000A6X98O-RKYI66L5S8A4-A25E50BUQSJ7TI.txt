Title: super noisy
Content:
i have no idea what makes the heater so noisy. i was using a different type heater which was pretty quiet. This one turns out to be a whole different noisy heater. furthermore, even if you turn to the low power the noise doesn't decrease at all. although it does provide reasonable heat i don't recommend any of you buy it.

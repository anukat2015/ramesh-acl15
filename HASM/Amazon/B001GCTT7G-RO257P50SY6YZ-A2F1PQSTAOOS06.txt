Title: Disappointed
Content:
While the unibody is nice, the new aluminum Macbook isn't made well.  The battery cover is very loose (so is 2 of my friends), it dents and scratches easily with just a regular watch I had on and placed on a wooden table, and the screen/graphics while a little better than the previous Macbook, isn't a lot better.  It seems like Apple rushed this out and didn't take the time to build it with quality in mind.  I spent a great deal of money on this, but the previous Macbook 2.4 for the same amount of money has a lot more power in benchmark tests than this one.  It has no firewire power which is really stupid.  Even a $500 Dell has that.  The previous Macbook had it.  My friends already has 2 stains on his palm rest which will not come out.
I can't recommend this computer to anyone and that is sad because I'm a big fan of Apple products and have 2 other computers by them.  I have a black Macbook and a iMac.  I'm returning this to Apple and will just use my black Macbook which is better in my opinion anyways.
Apple quality has taken some strong hits lately.  They are devoted to building iPods and iPhones and have forgotten about their computer line.  Very disappointing.

Title: Too dang small, and messy
Content:
I bought this because my local department store didn't have the Brew 'n' Go coffeemaker with the travel mug - big mistake! None of my mugs will fit into this thing! Also, the coffee grounds wash out of the filter and into the reservoir, which is annoying. Finally, the first cup I made was very messy - I got water everywhere. I'm a bit of a klutz, but I've never had that much trouble with a coffeemaker in the past. No one around here seems to have the Brew 'n' Go in stock, so I guess I'm gonna go with the Toastess. I can't wait on Amazon to ship it - I need coffee now!

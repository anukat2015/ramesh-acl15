Title: great for the price
Content:
I looked at many different canister vacs before going with the Hoover WindTunnel. I thought it's price and the bagless factor were the best for me. It's working great, and is the perfect thing for my hardwood floors and carpets. The dust bin is smaller than that of an upright, but I would say that's the only drawback. I love that the controls are on the handle and not the canister. It's lightweight and pulls easily through the house.

Title: The best home coffee maker I've ever purchased.
Content:
This Bunn makes a consistent and great tasting pot of coffee every time. I'm drinking nearly a pot a day now:)  It makes a perfect pot every time. I use "Peets" coffee and I have yet to make a bad pot. In the past I've had a tendency to make strong coffee and inconsistent coffee with some occasional bitterness. Although with this brewer it's difficult to make a strong pot of coffee, it outweighs the perfectly balanced brew each time. No bells and whistles is just fine with me. It's also nice to have the pot brewed in under 3 1/2 minutes or so. If you don't want to make a whole pot, you can still make a minimum of 4 cups. Though a tad bit pricey for a home coffee maker, I highly recommend it for those who want great tasting coffee everytime.

Title: Excellent alternative Notebook (price vs specs)
Content:
I'm not going to write  book here about it - there's already alot of reviews.  However, people always rate their new notebooks high for the 1st year of ownership.  See what the ratings look like after people have owned it for over a year - that's when all the defects (if any?) emerge & depreciation takes its toll.  
My main reason for buying this was the price $379 + tax.  After about two years I won't be out much and can buy another one.  My last notebook was $1600 then depreciated down to about $50 and wore-out after two yrs.  So, that's not good!  Besides liking the Acer's weight, battery life, Win7, temps, and design - the price makes it attractive & safe alternative.

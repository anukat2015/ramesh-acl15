Title: Sony - Not a laptop company
Content:
I had to give 1 star because I can not give zero star. I have purchase sony AR-520E for my self. The laptop touch, keybord design, screen quality everything is not what you paid for. Sony does not know how to build a laptop, especially after being so many years in business. I can say this becuase I bought HP as a gift for someone after I purchased sony. HP came at same price, had 7500 processor, 8600 GS video card, better screen. HP/ Toshiba are better computer companies with lots of good features in Computer usability. Sony is $400 expensive and less user friendly that similar products from HP.
Here is why you should not by any sony laptop, holds true for all sony models,
1. USB ports are at near end right side, instead of being further back near screen. If you use mouse and you are right handed, cable will make right side unusable.
2. It has only 2 USB ports, using 3rd USB port will block your speakers.
3. Notebook mousepad is located by edge of computer. You have to lift your hand if you have to use mouse. 
4. Mouse button are expose and vunarable to damage.
5. The lock to keep laptop close, has hook big as fishing hook. dont forget to close it or it will hurt your hand.
6. Keyboard layout is the one which I have never seen before. HP has full keyboard. Sony keyboard is located way down, which means you dont have support while typing.
7. Full HD 1080 is low quality resolution than what HP and Toshiba has.
8. No Remote for Multimedia usage. Buttons for Multimedia do not have lights which means you have to search for them.
Here is much better product that you should consider.

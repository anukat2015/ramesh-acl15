Title: Finally keyboard backlighting!!!
Content:
Backlit keyboard is this laptop's best feature and makes using it far more versatile.  Unfortunately, the keyboard itself is not as effective for everyDAY use.  The center area of the keyboard is not as well supported so you have to punch the central area keys a lot harder to get the keys to register on the display.  Huge HDD (500GB) and 4gigs of memory, along with Centrino equipped 2.0GHz CPU, make this 64bit Vista PC perform really well.  The WEI is only 3.7 because the integrated graphics support is not as good as most Desktops with a dedicated plug-in video card.  That is made up for the true 16x9 widescreen 16" diagonal display.  Also built-in is a 1.3MP webcam, microphone and two speakers.  HDMI output connector is a nice bonus.  Only thing missing is Bluetooth support and a BluRay DVD player.  Internet WiFi access is very fast and reliable.  All in all a very good value and feature rich Notebook PC for the price.

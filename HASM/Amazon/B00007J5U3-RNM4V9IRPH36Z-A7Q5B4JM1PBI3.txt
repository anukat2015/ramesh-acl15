Title: Hardwood floor Brush for Bosch Formula Vacuum
Content:
This brush is very gentle on hardwood and laminate flooring. I debated whether to buy this because my Bosch Formula already comes with a motorized brush that you flip a switch to turn on the brush rollers.  However the brush roller is very aggressive and is great for non scratch flooring like tile and vinyl. I have used the Hard Floor Brush and it gets the dirt to where the vacuum can pick it up. The motorized brush without turning on the brush rollers just moves the dust around. I shopped price and Go-Vacuum was the best price, and they were quick to ship.

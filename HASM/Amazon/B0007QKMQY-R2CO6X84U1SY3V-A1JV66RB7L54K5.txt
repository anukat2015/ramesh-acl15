Title: Quite a camera...
Content:
The canon rebel xt is a great budget/beginner's DSLR! This camera is now my baby!! =] 
I would highly recommend it to the beginning amateur or serious amateur. This camera has both manual and auto settings. It is incredibly easy to use if you have done your homework...for example, you must use the viewfinder to shoot the picture, for some this is a turn off.
As for ergonomics, this camera is light and compact compared to other DLSR's, this has worked out great for me, because I have small hands. If you have larger hands I would suggest getting a battery pack grip to make it more comfortable.
The pictures so far have come out stunning using the kit lens. The kit lens is pretty flexible and will be able to take 90% of the shots you will need. However, I would suggest getting other lenses if you need to be a bit more creative. I think I'll be ordering the 75-300mm lens and EF 50mm f-1.8 II pretty soon!
Battery life is great, mine lasted through hundreds of shots, and it comes halfway charged right out of the box, so you don't have to wait to play with your new baby!!! And as for memory cards, I would suggest going with a high speed memory card, if you don't you won't be able to take advantage of the burst mode. The SanDisk Ultra II 2 GB will get the job done quick enough, plus it's cheaper than the SanDisk Extreme III.
If you are looking into taking the plunge into SLR photography, as I was, DO IT!! This camera is an amazing learning tool, and great investment!

Title: Fantastic --- Sunbeam Hot Shot Beverage Machine
Content:
My Mom has one and she absolutely loves her Sunbeam Hot Shot Beverage machine, she has had this machine for many years.
I recently bought one for myself and Mom was right that I would also love mine!  I use my Sunbeam Hot Shot Beverage machine to quickly heat up a cup of water for oatmeal, hot chocolate, soup or water for noodles.
I would buy this item for other people.  It makes an excellent gift such as a housewarming, Christmas, birthday or anniversay gift.  I truly LOVE my Sunbeam Hot Shot Beverage machine.  My Mom's machine is getting old... I know what I will be getting her for Christmas this year!

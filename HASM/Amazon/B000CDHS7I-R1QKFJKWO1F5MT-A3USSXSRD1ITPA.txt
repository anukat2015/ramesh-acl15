Title: Down With Krups
Content:
I bought this coffee pot on November 2nd.  I have always been a Krups lover, and finally had an opportunity to by my own.  Within the first two weeks the clock went on the fritz, no longer allowing me to set a timer for the coffee.  Then about a week later the leaking started!  It started as just a few drops but now its up to about half a cup per pot.  This morning when I came down to start my morning coffee, the pot was already on, empty.  Much to my supprise.  Although it is on it will not brew.  Ive tried unplugging it to reset it with no luck.  Then the kicker.  I called Krups as it is only 3 months old and still under warranty.  They told me I would need to ship it out to the closest warranty center, at my expense, they would then try to fix it and i would have it back in thirty days!  So good night I guess I'm going to sleep for the next thirty days, or Ill just buy a kitchen aid that is much better with their warranty.

Title: sound operation
Content:
I don't like the sound system of sony laptops. I had dell for two years and I just loved how loud was the sound system of Dell Inspiron laptops. Recently I decided to try sony and I got little disappointed on how wierd it sounded. I returned it back to the store. Customer service agreed with my complain. I tried some other sony laptops in the store for sound, and came to conclusion that sony is not the best product for listening music on line.

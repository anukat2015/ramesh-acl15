Title: to clear up the filter issue
Content:
I loved reading the reviews and yours especially Spyryl. You brought up some "common sense" replys. lol. But there is a type of "filter" that should be used with all propane fueled devices except ones that use the 1 lb. bottles. The bottles are already filtered. Propane can get contaminated when connecting and unconnecting. The filter is just a trap made with pipe just before it enters your unit. Instead of using a straight adapter to connect to your unit, use a tee and have a 1" pipe connect to an elbow and connect up to a 2" pipe pointing downwith a cap on the end. This allows contaminants to collect in the trap and you can take the cap off once a year, with the propane cut off, and clean it out. I have two wall mounted propane heaters and I have a filter on both. Just thought I would let you know there is a filter for propane in 5 lb. tanks and above. You just make it yourself really. Not one made up that I have seen. Again thanks to all for the replys. I am thinking about buying one of these heaters and the information helps.

You may be right in that the filter may not need to be used but if you can use it and it help I think it is a good idea to use one. But you are wrong that I am the other person that posted. This was my first post and this is my first update. I am just offering my opinions and did not ever state I was an LP expert. But this filter was recommend to me by an LP expert.

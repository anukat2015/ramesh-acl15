Title: Great Laptop
Content:
I have been using this computer for a week - several hours per day. I have not had any problems. It is FAST. The Index rating, using Windows 7, is 4.2 with most individual ratings close to 6.0. We're talking speed and work capabilities where the max is a 7.9 rating. A similar HP with 500g hard drive and 4g memory only scored 2.0. Wireless works great. Webcam is great. Speakers are better than my desktop!
Great buy!

Title: Bells & Whistles
Content:
I bought the camera by itself with the Nikon 18-200mm lens. I'm really excited to move up from my Nikon N55 and I'm really impressed! I love being able to pick what I want to print and see what I want to keep, or need to re-shoot.
PROS
design (buttons, two separate dials, great for setting f-stop and aperture)
battery life
3 inch screen
pick your focus point
BEAUTIFUL VIDEO!!
CONS
cannot figure out continuous shooting!!
video mode when you move the camera around
Auto-focus in live view...annoying!

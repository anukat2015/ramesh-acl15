Title: Compact, durable, and extremely user friendly...a nice buy...
Content:
I had bought two Creative Zens 30GB before this and they both were dead on arrival...I tried this and it was perfect...smaller and so more portable (fits in my shirt pocket easily) and perfect for travel...i use this mostly in my car so the charger/FM transmitter (iTrip) is a must buy...
With it's small size the screen is way too small for serious video watching but adequate for short plane trips and travel around 2-3 hours. Battery life is excellent,,,Of course, 8 Gb ain't much, but still enough for my whole music collection (about 6000 songs) and about 7 vids ranging from 5-40 minutes long. Still I will be looking forward to one with about 15Gb or more.
Highly recommended...

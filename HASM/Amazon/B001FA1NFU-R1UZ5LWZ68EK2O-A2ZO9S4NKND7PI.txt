Title: Great for playing music
Content:
I'll be honest, the major reason I bought this ipod was for the color. I have a 5th generation ipod video, and have been waiting for one with nice color to buy. After 3 years with one that can play videos, games, read books, keep a contact list, and music, I have realized that the 30GB ipod was more than I needed. 
The ipod brand has been out for a long time there's no need for me to go into deatail about its ease of us. And its durable too, my old ipod still works great, have never had a problem. Just downsizing to something that fits me better. 
This ipod is for you: 
If you have up to 2,000 songs to store. 
If you want the choice to pick the songs to play in addition to the shuffle feature. 
If you want bright fun colors to you player. 
If you want something thats light. 
As far as the battery life: 
I use this ipod in my car to work, durring work, in the car after work, at home. I'm able to completely run out the battery on most days if I'm messing around with it. No big deal I just put it on the charger before I go to bed, and when I wake up its good to go for another 12+ hour day. I can't really comment on how much battery life it has if I were to use it for other things... because I only use it for music. 
The one major thing I have never liked is that the headphone jack is at the bottom of the ipod. Don't know why, my other ipod the jack is located on the top. The placement of the jack on the nano makes it awkward to hold in your hand. 
And lastly, the reduce price at amazon makes me consider buying another color or two to keep one in the car, and one at my locker at work. :)

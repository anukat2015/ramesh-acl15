Title: Light weight easy to use with powerful suction
Content:
This is the greatest little vacuum that I have used in a long time. It does wonderful job of sucking up pet hair, fir needles, lint, and dirt in no time. The attachments are conveniently placed on the hose wand for the small jobs that come along as you are tackling the hardwood, laminate, tile, and linoleum floors.  The Dirt Devil Breeze is the perfect vacuum for use in cleaning the furniture, RV, auto, and home. I highly recommend it.

Title: Excellent color, low noise, speed and focus
Content:
Added to D2X, D70 and Fuji S3 collection. Image quality is much better than the 4.1 MP suggests. Equal to or better than D70 (better at iso 400 and above than D70), Slightly less resolution than S3 and about same noise up to 800, Fuji pulls ahead at 1600 but you have to look at a 100% crop to see it. Much less noise than D2X. 
Speed in continuous shooting, saving files and focus is much faster than S3 - no contest. Focus is much faster than D70.
D2X advantage is solely a result of the 12MP sensor - higher resolution, however, it is visible only very slightly in 8X10 print.
Battery life is stellar, like D70 and D2X - all day or two shooting.

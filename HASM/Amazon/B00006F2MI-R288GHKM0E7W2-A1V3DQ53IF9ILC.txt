Title: Looks can be Deceiving--do not recommend this coffeepot
Content:
I spent more money on this coffeepot than any other one I've ever bought...and am extremely disappointed in it.  I have 2 main complaints:  the grinding and the water reservoir.  I'm used to grinding my beans espresso fine.  But, I am unable to do that with this grinder since there are no settings for how fine you want your beans ground.  Therefore, coffee made using this grinder tastes like dishwater to me.  For me to get a decent cup of coffee, I would have to use three times the amount of beans I normally use when using my old grinder.  One of the main reasons I bought this pot was for the grinder so I could eliminate the need for another appliance setting on the counter, but now I don't use this grinder at all and instead I'm back to using my old grinder.
Second, how are you supposed to know how much water is in the reservoir?  I have to climb on a stool or chair to look down into the machine to see the water gauge.  Obviously, I've learned how much to pour in for my normal 2 cups but what about when I want to make more? I have to stand on a chair to look down inside at the water gauge.  Certainly, it looks nice but this is absolutely the worst coffee pot I've ever bought.  I'm actually hoping it will break soon so I can replace it, with a cheaper brand next time.

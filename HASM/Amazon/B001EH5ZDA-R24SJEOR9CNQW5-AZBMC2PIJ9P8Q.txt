Title: Excellent machine. Might be cheaper at other stores.
Content:
This laptop is excellent for the cheap prices you can find it elsewhere, though the Amazon price is somewhat high.
The design is elegant, and it feels fairly solid.
In terms of functionality, I took the step of phasing out my desktop for this machine, and the multimedia functionality is good enough.
Like most laptops, the built in speakers sound a little tinny, but there are headphone sockets that produce static-free output.
Compaq and HP tend to bundle Internet Provider links and an Office trial, and this machine is no different.
Most of these were uninstalled without any issues, and uninstalling the muVee editing application cleaned up a win32 crash when starting Sony Vegas.
Startup and shutdown is fast enough, and the Core 2 Duo T5750 CUP provides enough processing power for moth operations.
DVD and video playback is smooth, and the IR Remote Control can be stored in the ExpressCard slot for convenience.
This machine is highly recommended for general use.

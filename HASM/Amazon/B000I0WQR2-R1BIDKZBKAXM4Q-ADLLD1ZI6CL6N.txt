Title: It heats me up!
Content:
This is a great heater.  I use it in our master bedroom which is 14'x20' with 8' ceilings and it heats the room up in about an hour and keeps it warm all night.  I am use to our little fan heater which is loud and we always kept it on high so the first night with this heater I put it on high and set it at the highest temperature.  It is quiet and put out the heat slowly so I didn't think twice about it.  The only sound from this heater is the occasional soft pop sound as the heater turns on and off during operation. In the middle of the night I woke up sweating, it felt like I was in a sauna.  I now leave it on high but only on the second to lowest temperature level and this keeps the room at a nice comfortable level all night.  This allows us to lower the thermostat at night on our home furnace!  I live in Indiana so the winters are typically in the teens to mid twenties, for reference if you were wondering.

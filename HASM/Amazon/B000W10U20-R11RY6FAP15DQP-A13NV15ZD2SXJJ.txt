Title: Excellent Laptop
Content:
This is a wonderful laptop. My husband gave it to me for Christmas so he could take over the 17" Dell Inspiron so we could compute in bed together.
It's fast and smooth and looks great, too. It's easy to transport which is one of the reasons for my husband giving me this. To be fair it isn't perfect, but that mostly for the following reasons:
1. the battery connection is on the right side of the computer which can interfere with using the mouse. 
2. I agree with the user who said the touchpad can be touchy, but that happens on the other laptop as well and I think it's only because this is smaller
3. Be sure to delete the software you don't want since Vista is memory hog. I deleted Norton immediately and put on Avast & Adaware 
4. the screen is a little difficult, but it's the next wave and that's ok since most of the time there isn't much of a problem.
I sometimes have wireless problems and I can't tell how much is our wireless and how much is the laptop. It's gotten better.
I never use the battery so that's a non-issue.
To sum up, it's a great computer with a few minor flaws that can be inconvenient. The videocam is great though!!!

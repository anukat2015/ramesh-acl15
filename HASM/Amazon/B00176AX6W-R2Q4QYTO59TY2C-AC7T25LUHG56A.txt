Title: I love it, I love it, I love it
Content:
First, in the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit that I have been anti-Apple for a number of years.  However, all of my friends have iPod Classics or iPod Touches and even they have been impressed with my new Zune toy.  The screen is beautiful and the fact that giant pictures of the album art appear whenever a song plays makes you just want to stare at the screen for hours.  I find the software easy to use and I had very little trouble syncing approx. 20GB of music from an external hard drive all at once.  The radio is a perk and the podcasts are phenomenal.  Of course, the one little thing that would make this absolutely perfect is downloadable video (movies and TV shows) from the Marketplace.  I have no doubt that good ol' Bill Gates is working on this as we speak, though.  Despite my prejudices, I have to say that this Zune blows your typical iPod completely out of the water and gets some very admiring stares on the subway :-)  I highly recommend!!!

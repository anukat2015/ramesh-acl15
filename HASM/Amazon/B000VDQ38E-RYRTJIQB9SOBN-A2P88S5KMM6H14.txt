Title: Very effective
Content:
I just bought one of these and used it in my living room and bedroom.  I have 4 cats, one of which is a fluffy long hair.  I also know someone with all kinds of allergies who periodically visits and stays overnight.  She said that a friend highly recommended this vacuum and now I see why.
I just cleaned a small area rug and the living room furniture and emptied the vacuum.  Then I cleaned half the floor of my bedroom and emptied the very over full vacuum.  (I was watching the floor, not the canister.)  Then I cleaned the other half of the bedroom floor and emptied the vacuum again, because it was over filled again.  Finally, I cleaned the cat furniture and a small bathroom floor and emptied it again.  Holy crap, this thing is effective.  I think that I threw out about 3-5 human head sized balls of fluff and dust.
I would definitely recommend this thing to anyone with several pets, especially if you have friends with allergies.

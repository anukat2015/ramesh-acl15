Content:
I have owned a black 1st gen 2GB iPod for about a year, and I'm not happy.  I had very few problems with it until recently, the buttons on it stopped working and doing apples recommended "5 r's" did not help.  I called apples technical service line and guess what...THEY WOULD NOT EVEN TALK TO ME...unless your ipod is still under the 1 year warranty, they will not give any help, at all, none. They did however refer me to their online forums...what a joy...here I find 20 other people with he same problem I'm having, with still no answers.  I found no "authorized ipod technician" on these forums, just a bunch of frustrated customers with unanswered questions.  Apple refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem and don't seem too keen on fixing it.
If you do still plan on buying this product (and I don't recommend it) at least buy an extended service plan like I did.  When I got mine Bestbuy offered a 2 year "Product Replacement Plan" basically you can send your ipod in any time within 2 years for any problem and they will send you a voucher which is in-store credit for the cost of the ipod when you bought it + any tax, A great deal in my opinion, I think it only cost an extra $30

Title: If you buy from Amazon, beware of it coming w/ iLife '08
Content:
I purchased my laptop from Amazon in February 2009. Although iLife '09 was announced in January 2009, my laptop was still shipped with the old version. The upgrade costs an extra $80. If you purchase your laptop directly from Apple then it only costs $10 for the upgrade. Just something to be aware of.

Title: Keurig vs Breville
Content:
I have the Breville 6000 which works great.  Wanted to add a second unit at my in-laws and thought the Keurig B60 would fit the bill, especially since Keurig makes the Breville.  Unfortunately, there's a difference in the units that, to me, is significant.  The Breville has a round foam piece at the spout that fits nicely into the indentation at the top of the K-cup (the one you fill with your own coffee) and which prevents leakage.  Not so with the Keurig which just has the bare spout.  Consequently, about half way through the brewing time, plain water (not coffee) would start to leak out of the Keurig.  Most would leak into the cup, some would not.  The interior of the Keurig has several pieces fastened together which provide seams for the water to leak.  The Breville is one piece, no seams. Not realizing the diffent design, I took the first Keurig back, got a second one, same problem.  Once I looked at the Breville, the difference was obvious.  The Keurig makes fine coffee, it just leaks.  I will add if you make the smaller sized coffees, it doesn't leak as much as there is a smaller quantity of water involved.  It also does not leak nearly as much if you use the pre-packaged K cups. Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System

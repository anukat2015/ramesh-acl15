Title: Good camera, but first one came shipped with multiple bad pixels on the screen
Content:
Good camera, but first one came shipped with multiple bad pixels on the screen.  The camera is easy to use, light, and takes good pictures.  Would give a 5/5 except Nikon's quality control is bad.  I cannot remember the last time I received bad pixels lcd display.  Amazon quickly replaced the item with no hassle at all

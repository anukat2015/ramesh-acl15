Title: PLEASE READ
Content:
Please I beg you before you buy this item, beware its a beautiful machine, when it works, but the moment something happens..you are screwed. There is no customer service!!! I have owned this product, for a month now, it worked great, i purchased the DVR dock, works great, I than purchased the plug-in to watch certain video files(AAC, H256) and i was unable to download them( they do not send you a hard copy, you must download from there site). I understand a computer glitch, but i have been trying for over two weeks to contact them via there customer service line, waitng one time over an hour, no answer. I finally spoke with an operator who said that they have been unundated  by calls and asked for my information and number. I am still waiting. I also attempted to contact them via email...NOTHING. So if you like the product and are lucky enough to have one with no problems...it s a fine machine, but if your like the thousands of others that might need support...good luck... I am not happy at all..

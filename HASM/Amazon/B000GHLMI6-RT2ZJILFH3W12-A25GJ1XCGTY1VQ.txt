Title: Glad to be enjoying coffee again
Content:
We had a Hamilton beach coffee maker for years, never gave it much thought or appreciation. I am not a coffee connisuer. It started malfuntioning about a year ago and I checked the local stores for a hard to find replacement, I was leary about the prices of the few I did find. I picked up a cheap Mr Coffee type system and we started using it in the Fall. I noticed we were pouring out half drank mugs of coffee and a month ago we started having coffee grounds seeping out of the basket into the pot, so I tracked down the old Hamilton Beach Brewmaster again on Amazon. Once I set it up, I noticed I was refilling my coffee cup two or three times each morning, no more dumping out half drank cups. It is worth every penny.

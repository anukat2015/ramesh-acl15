Title: ARMY Strong
Content:
I had this camera sent to me while on deployment to Afghanistan. I understand Amazon.com's policy on sending electronics over seas so I had to have it mailed home to the states so the wife could sent it to me from there. I was using a small Canon "point and shoot" which was great for taking out on patrols, but I needed something more for back on base, capturing the mountains and the beautiful skyline the way I see them. There's only so much you can manipulate manually on a "point and shoot". I'll be attending a photography class when I return home and the Canon XSI allows me to become more camera savvy in preparation for school. I LOVE this thing! Anyone who wants to get into photography professionally or just as a hobby, I HIGHLY recommend one of Canon's Rebel line. They have one to fit your shooting style no matter what it is. Three other soldiers in this (very small) base have a Canon Rebel of some kind and they agree, GO CANON REBEL!

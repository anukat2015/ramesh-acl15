Title: iPod Nano rocks
Content:
This iPod is an upgrade to the older and clunkier one I've had for a few years.  It is light weight and easy to use.  It has about 4 days of music some photos, and a few games, and I could add a a few movies without running out of space.  The only improvement would be if it would both play and charge at the same time in my Bose docking station/speaker.

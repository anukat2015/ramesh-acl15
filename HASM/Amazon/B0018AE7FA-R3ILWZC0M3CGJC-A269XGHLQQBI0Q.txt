Title: Negative reviewers haven't got a clue!!
Content:
I just purchased this coffee maker and it does make 6 cups of coffee. Other reviewers have no clue what a cup of coffee is evidently. Coffee makers are 4 oz. = a cup, not 8 oz. My previous coffee maker was a 12 cup and I only ever made coffee up to the 6 cup line on the side of the pot. This coffee maker makes the exact same amount. I use the same mug and I get the same amount. This coffee maker is perfect and makes great coffee. I love the easy clean up and the small size. Couldn't ask for a better coffee maker.

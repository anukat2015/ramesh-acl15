Title: Love, love, love it!
Content:
I recently bought a new condo with hardwood floors throughout and have a nice thick wool area rug in the living room.  I really struggled with the most efficient way to clean the floors and the Hoover canister vacuum is so fast, easy and efficient.  I love the power nozzle feature which allows a quick and easy transition from floor to carpet cleaning.  I am amazed at how much it picks up!  The area rug is still very new, so it is shedding somewhat, the vacuum picks up a full container every time I vacuum.  I find it extremely easy to remove it and empty it out.  I am thrilled that it is the only vacuum cleaner that I need.  I highly recommend this vacuum!

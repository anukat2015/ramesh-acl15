Title: Very Happy
Content:
I spent way tooooo long researching and reading and thinking about which laptop to buy and then bought the Toshiba.  I'm sure other choices would have worked for me as well, but I'm VERY happy with the Toshiba.  
It looks good, which, while not a big factor, is a nice bonus.  It's fast.  I've used a number of other PC's running Vista and they've all been pretty slow, so I think the 4GB of memory is a big help.  This laptop has built-in DVD control buttons in the housing above the keyboard and while I wouldn't have bought it because of this feature, it turns out to be REALLY easy to use and helpful!
I've been surprised at how much I like it!  I've used products from Dell, HP, Compaq, IBM, Lenovo, Apple and Sony and this Toshiba is, so far, better for me than anything I've used before.

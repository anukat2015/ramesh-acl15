Title: Pet Lover Mighty Mite
Content:
Purchased the Mighty Mite about six weeks ago.  So far- we are very impressed. The suction- This is what vacs are supposed to do.  Very good suction.  That is what you are paying for- suction and mobility.  It works very good for dog hair.  
Basically, does what it is supposed to do- not a lot of extras- such as cord retraction.

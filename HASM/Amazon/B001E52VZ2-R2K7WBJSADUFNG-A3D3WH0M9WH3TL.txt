Title: Great small vacuum. Great job on the dust, loud.
Content:
I used to own a Mighty Light, which is a very similar vacuum from Eureka.
Used that one for about 5-6 years until it finally broke.
This thing is slightly stronger and a little louder. 
This vacuum does a great job getting dust and Cat hair from just about anything(carpet, velvet drapes). Best part is you do not have to run the thing over every inch of the surface (unlike other small canisters), it's powerful enough to suck dust in even when it's in the close proximity.

Title: Ipod Nano
Content:
This product is incredible. It is well built (feels solid), but also thin,small & very light. I am able to put it in my pocket and forget it is even there.It took me forever to finally buy a real Ipod (Nano). This little thing is worth it's weigh in gold. It is easy and fun to use. I was a little taken back when it didn't come with detailed instructions. Although it came with a quick setup set of instructions, that is probably all you will ever need. If you are like me and love to read every single detail/feature, then you can access the instructions via the Apple website/Itunes. So many features and functions, more than you'll ever need. I purchased the clear protective case (.01) and charger for about ($3) in a bundle through Amazon. These same items are approximately ($25-$30) each at different stores including Apple.

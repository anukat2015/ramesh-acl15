Title: Great til it breaks!
Content:
Bought this coffeemaker based on having great review and thermal carafe. Have loved it up til yesterday when it completely stopped working. I pushed the on button and the light came on but the coffee did not brew, nor did it make any sound. Yes, there was water in the reservoir etc.
Called the manufacturer and will send it in for repair. Honestly, this is only six months old. Would not recommend buying it.

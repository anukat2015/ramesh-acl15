Title: A few minor goofs, but all in all, a very stable and professional system
Content:
This was an emergency purchase for me, as my old laptop finally gave up the ghost after 5 long years of abuse, and I needed a new one for work.  So far, the A205-S4577 has kept up with both work and home.  Video is remarkably clear, and controls are nice.  Toshiba's add-ons are a bit of a nuisance, and needed to be disabled, and the keyboard takes a little bit of getting used to (I couldn't, however, tell you why -- it just doesn't *feel* quite right at first), but all in all, I'm very happy with my purchase.

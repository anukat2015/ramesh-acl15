Title: Fire Hazard
Content:
Our master bedroom seems to be at least 10-15 degrees colder than any other room in our house so we use a space heater at night. We had purchased the Lasko mainly because of the thermostat option - Worked great for about 2 months. Then we were awoke in the middle of the night by the beeping it makes when it over heats and it shut off. This continued for a couple of nights - it would work fine for several hours then beep and shut itself off. After about 3-4 nights of this when I woke to the beeping I could also smell something burning - we immideately unplugged the unit. The next morning when we looked more closely into it - the outlet on the wall where we had it plugged in was burnt and melted around the prong openings! I guess I should be happy at least with the overheat beeping it does since it is loud and annoying enough to wake you!!  Won't buy a Lasko space heater again!!

Title: The little heater that could.........
Content:
I have been a "fan" of quiet, fanless quartz heaters for over a quarter century. They are typically hard to find, expensive and not necessarily versatile. This low cost, low profile quartz heater is a big hit in my book. The dual power capability is extemely useful and much more of a green contributor than the typical 1500w coil or ceramic heater.
Cons: The base could use extra weight simply for ease of movement; however, there is an tip over shutoff switch for safety. 
Buy one, the silence will kill you, the heat.............oh, so nice.

Title: Ipod 80 GB
Content:
I am overall happy with this item. Originally when I purchased it, after 1 month it froze, and I had to send it back because it wouldnt unfreeze. It does, however, have great video capabilities and is a great product, just dont drop it!!!I've seen several ipods with the large screen, that have been dropped and cracked the display, this isnt too hard to do, epecially if your in a hurry. I did own a ipod mini, which I had for 2 years, but I got just a little water on it from my gym bag, which got in the groves and affected the sound, it sounded like static from a radio station everytime I tried to play it. I tried to take it back to the  apple store and had the "GuRu" look at it, but he said that he say ipods that got wet before, and once water gets on it, forget it, it cant be fixed. He did however, offfer a 10% discount if I turned that one in and purchased an new one, BIG DEAL!!! I could get 10% off at the Target website.Anyways, Ive only had it a couple of months, but I learned a valuable lesson about not getting it wet!!!So far, so good!!!.

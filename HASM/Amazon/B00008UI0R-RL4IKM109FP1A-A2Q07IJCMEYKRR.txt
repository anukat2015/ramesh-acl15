Title: Wind tunnel vacuum
Content:
The vacuum does a superb job of cleaning....it has more than enough suction and I like the adjustable setting for suction.  I have only three complaints...it is difficult to maneuver, the canister has to be emptied very often and it is heavy.  On the plus side, my son recently visited and asked if we had new carpeting...Over all I am pleased with my purchase.

Title: Canon EOS40D--Great Camera.
Content:
I've long been a serious photographer for years. I've owned a Canon AL-1 35mm for years and then owned Sony digital Mavica. I decided to move up into the DSLR cameras.  I looked at the Nikon 40D and many others.  I spent many months examining specifications of many cameras before deciding to purchase the canon EOS40D with the EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens and a 4GB memory card.
 It's an excellent camera and I'm excited to get to know it. First, let me say whatever your background is, you can't go wrong with this camera. If you want professional high quality images, this camera is capable of producing them for you. If you want, you can stay with the automatic settings and point & shoot, it will take excellent pictures for you. If you want to get more involved and "roll your own", you can!  The knobs and controls are very easy to understand and remember. You can control as little or as much as you want. The LCD screen is large and the menus use large fonts, colorfully which makes it easy to read.  The camera comes with all the software you require for most work. Professions will still want to use Adobe Photoshop and/or Adobe Lightroom. 
I did purchase a spare battery. I wanted the 8GB memory card but couldn't justify the cost. After taking pictures for awhile, I feel that was a good choice. The 4GB card is large enough for most photographers and most work. I'm picky! I want to take and produce the highest quality photos that I can. I use Adobe Photoshop CS3 and Adobe Lightroom. I purchased X-rite Eye-one to calibrate my LCD monitor. I also purchased the X-rite ColorChecker Macbeth color chart and along with the snap-n AcrCalibrator version 1.2 for adobe Photoshop CS3 to calibrate my camera and create presets for my camera when I use the RAW mode.I import my 40D RAW files (.cr2) into adobe bridge and into Photoshop CS3 without problems. I use adobe RBG(1998) as my color manager. 
  This is by far the best camera I have ever used. It is a reliable true friend. I have added the Canon EF 100-400mm f4.5-5.6L IS USM lens to my collection. You won't go wrong with the this Camera.

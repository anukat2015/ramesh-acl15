Title: Vac is great - Customer Service really sucks....
Content:
This vac only lasted for 3 months!  It cleaned great and was easy to use until the powered floor nozzle quit working after 3 months.  The Hoover company would not answer my emails, when I called I got a customer service person in another contry that I could not understand and didn't understand me or what my problem was.
I called two more times and was given the names of service centers that were all over 100 miles from my home and told I had to take it to one of them.  I have never had as bad an experience or been so dissatisfied with any company as I have with Hoover.  I will never buy one of their products again no matter how good it might be.

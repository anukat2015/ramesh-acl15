Title: Broke after two weeks
Content:
It worked great on the first two nights.
After that, the auto-safety or auto-thermostat was kicking in prematurely and turning it off after 30 seconds of being on such that leaving it on would result in the heater constantly turning itself off and on... not long enough to warm the room at all.
Finally, this behavior stopped... because the heating element no longer worked... just the fans.  So after two weeks of attempted nightly use, I now have a device that can circulate air at room temperature without any heat.

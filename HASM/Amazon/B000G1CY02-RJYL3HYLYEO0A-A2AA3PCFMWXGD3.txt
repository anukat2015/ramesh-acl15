Title: How to remove the lame sticker on an otherwise great product
Content:
Many other people have already said how neat this product is. I'll second that. Fantastic! The sticker on the front that says 'Remove Before Use' that is near impossible to remove should be made of a different material, yes. However, rather than use solvents or razor blades to remove it, heat the sticker up with a hair dryer or other direct applied heat. Then, gently pull while still applying heat. (Your fingers will get toasty) Use a credit card as a wedge/scraper to help prevent any residue. Just gently push the edge of the card into the space between the sticker and the heater surface as you pull. It works perfectly. A totally clean heater surface!!!

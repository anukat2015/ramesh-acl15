Title: No Height Adjustment
Content:
I've had this vacuum for over one year and the roller brush has never worked correctly.  The brush would only turn when I pushed the head forward.  From reading many reviews today I see that I'm not the only one having this problem.  I have berber carpet and the roller will only turn when on tile.  After spending quite some time trying to fix the problem, finally the roller brush spins continuously like it should have from day one.  With no height adjustment available, the WHEELS WERE TAKEN OFF the head attachment.  Now it works.

Title: Kenwood air conditioner
Content:
I bought this unit as an open box buy.  It cools off  4 rooms wonderfully.  I was happy to be able to download the manual off of amazon's website.  I  have not been happy with Kenwood's customer service.  I had contacted Kenwood several times via email in order to order parts that were missing (because I bought it as an open box item) and to receive a manual but had no success.  My husband ended up  making  the window accessory that was missing and I ended up downloading the manual from amazon.com.Thanks guys!The portable air conditioner was definitely worth my money.

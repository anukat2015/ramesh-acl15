Title: 5 stars on the vacuum but I hate the bags
Content:
My old "Dirt Devil" died of old age and I needed a replacement.
This Eureka product does a better job of cleaning than my old one did --even on the carpet.  I only have one complaint; one unexpected problem --  the dust bags.  They are much larger than the ones I've used before and hold more dirt, and I like that.  The problem is with the rubber flange around the opening that keeps it from leaking dust.  It works fine, but I am deathy allergic to natural rubber and even touching it could, as have other rubber products, send me to the Emergency Room --or worse.  Like all the other manufacturers on this planet, other than those who make medical supplies, this information is not disclosed in the product information.  This failure annoys me very much, but is hardly unique to the Eureka Company.  Thank goodness I do not live alone, so I am able to get my husband to change the vacuum bags, but for a Latex allergic peson living alone this would be a very major drawback.

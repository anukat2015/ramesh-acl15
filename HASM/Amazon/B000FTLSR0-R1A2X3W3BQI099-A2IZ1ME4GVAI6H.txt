Title: Highly recommended
Content:
I've had this camera for 3 weeks now and I've grown to love it. 
Things I really like:
1. Beautiful pics in daylight or when using flash.
2. Excellent grip. Even though the body is quite compact, the grip is excellent - way better than the canon rebels and comparable to the Nikon D50.
3. Large, crisp LCD screen
4. Nice shutter sound.
Things I don't like
1. Poor AWB in Tungsten light. (more to come)
2. Using menus to change WB, ISO settings (instead of dedicated buttons)
3. Popup flash construction is rather flimsy.
More about AWB issues in Incandescent light..
AWB in Incandescent light (2700K) is a problem for most DSLRs. Unfortunately the K100D is really weak in this area. The reason is that the K100D AWB is designed to handle color temperature above 4000K.
The good thing is its easily fixable.
1. Use a flash.
2. Don't use Auto mode. Use P mode and use the dedicated 'Tungsten' WB mode.
3. Don't use incandescent bulbs! Use CFL lights instead. They are good for the environment and give much better light!
Conclusion
I really like this camera. It offers the best VFM compared to the Nikons and the Canons. Go Pentax!

Title: it is good!
Content:
yes it does have a short cord; yes it utilizes extra counter space; yes the water arm has to be moved before filling it with coffee; and yes, it is a 12 cup pot with no extra BUT, this hamilton beach is the BEST auto-coffeemaker i have ever owned -- going back 40 years and many different brands and models.
it's fast, programmable, pretty and makes great coffee.  who could ask for more?

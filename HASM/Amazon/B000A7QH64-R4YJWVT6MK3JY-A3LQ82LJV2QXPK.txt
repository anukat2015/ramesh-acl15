Title: Good Vac, Terrible Customer Service, Replacement Parts Impossible to Find
Content:
I really like this vacuum.  It keeps its charge and is pretty powerful.  I was completely happy with this purchase until I needed a replacement filter.  After looking on several websites for a replacement filter (it is really difficult to find a filter for this model), I finally purchased one from the Shark/Eurp-pro website.  This website looks and functions like it was created by a preschooler.  After ordering and receiving our filters that were recommended on their site for our vacuum, I discovered that the filters (again, recommended on their site) did not fit our vacuum.  I proceed to call the "customer service" department about how to process our return.  After 15 minutes of listening to a recorded message tell me "my wait time is approximately 8 minutes", I finally got to talk to a live person.  I explained my situation about how I ordered these filters and got the wrong ones.  I wanted to know how to return them, get my money back, not have to pay shipping since it wasn't my fault, and order the correct ones.  The guy on the other end proceed to tell me that I ordered the wrong ones and was responsible for paying the shipping to return the product.  Um, I DON'T THINK SO!  After asking to speak to a supervisor, this guy tells me that the supervisor would not give me a different answer.  I pushed harder and said I will wait to speak to a supervisor.  The guy comes back on the line after a few minutes and tells me that his supervisor has given him permission to refund my total, and I could just throw those other filters away.  This, of course, is to keep up with good customer service practices, I was told.  Then he asks if there is anything else he could help me with.  I said that he could walk me through the website on how to order the correct filters.  I believe he pretended not to hear me and told me to have a nice day.  35 minutes later and still no filters.  Then I try the online chat the website.  After telling me that I'm supposed to look up the model number without the last letter, so instead of SV736K, use SV736 (instructions that would be useful on their website), I was able to see all the parts associated with this vacuum.  They did have a filter listed in the parts, but it was the filter I had already purchased and I knew didn't fit this model.  Here is a copy of part of the chat conversation I had with the customer service rep, who actually helped me.
you: This filter number is XSB726N, which is one I just ordered and received. This filter does not fit SV736K.
Terry: XSB726N is for another model.
you: That is the filter listed for SV736
Terry: XSF736 is what you need for your unit. Apparently there is a mistake on the website because the one listed is doe SV738.
you: Thank you. I was just told that ordering this item was my error and given a difficult time getting my money back. Please tell me how to order the correct filter online. Is that possible?
All along it was Sharks fault and they tried to say it was my error.  A total of an hour later I am hoping new and correct filters will be mailed to me.  I will never buy another product from this company, and I recommend you think long and hard about a Shark purchase.
If anyone from this company is reading this, please get a professional to revamp your website (in fact call me) and teach your people what CUSTOMER SERVICE means.

Title: Quality accessory if you want economy and long burn time
Content:
If you want to maximize the safety, usefulness and economy of the propane Portable Buddy heater by Mr Heater or any other appliance that uses disposable 1 pound cylinders, you can't go wrong buying this hose! 
1. It allows the use of a larger LP tank (I have a 20 lb cylinder). I'm certain the savings from buying LP fuel in bulk will pay for the hose.
2. You can locate the bulk tank away from the lit heater. I use the heater primarily in my garage. With the hose I can get the heater off the floor and still have the bulk tank in a convenient and safe spot.
3. The hose can be used with any propane appliance that uses disposable propane cylinders.
The five foot length of this hose could be a drawback if you need or want to locate the bulk tank at a substantial distance from the appliance; if you don't have the room to move the tank then the length is no problem. The 12 foot hose can provide more flexibility, however.
Here's an essential safety tip for using this hose: be sure to shut/close the valve on the bulk tank BEFORE you remove the hose from the tank. It is possible to remove the hose end from the bulk tank without closing the tank valve and you will quickly find out that liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is another name for stinky, oily mess when it comes squirting out of the valve as I have done.

Title: More than just a digital camera
Content:
I had serveral small format digital cameras and had issues with battery life, image storage, taking multilpe photographs in a row, the ability to set the focus and depth of field. and on and on. This is what I recall with my film Nikons. And the old lenses work with it. I put a 4gig SD memory and have taken hundreds with flash and have had no issues, just good pictures

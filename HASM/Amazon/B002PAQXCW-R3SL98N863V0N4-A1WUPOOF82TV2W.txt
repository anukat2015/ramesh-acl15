Title: Hardware Engineer rates this laptop TOPs
Content:
ASUS did a fine job on this laptop. Power, memory, hardisk, 1080p+ with the right set of i/o's I prefer.  Win 7 is a different matter - have to upgrade too many other applications, etc. This my 2nd laptop from ASUS and again I am pleased..../Charles

Title: I LOVE it!
Content:
After owning a Canon AE-1 in high school (25 years ago), I bought this camera hoping that I could upgrade from my old Kodak 2.6 MP digital camera. 
Out of the box, this camera is unbelievable. Even if others have rated the 18-55mm lens low, I found it to be a fantastic camera for the beginner/amateur as myself. I have already purchased a nice zoom lens, and cannot wait to try it out. 
I would recommend this to ANYBODY that is thinking of starting a hobby or career in photography.

Title: HOT STUFF!
Content:
This is a great little heater at a great price!  I use it to warm my feet while working on the computer or watching tv.  Sometimes it actually gets too hot!  Tried it to warm up the bathroom one morning and the room just got too warm --- had to turn it off. One bonus (for me) is that it doesn't turn itself off when it reaches a certain temperature.  Nothing is more annoying than having an appliance tell me when I am warm enough.  This could be a problem for use around unpredictable children or pets... otherwise, it works better than promised.

Title: Don't buythe TX 1000z!!!!
Content:
You will need a motherboard in approximately 14 months; that's how long they last on the average.... Sure it will run great now but make sure that you get extended warranty coverage (upwards of a year). Your TX 1000z dissipates heat in a very poor manner: symptomatic of CPUs that have been overclocked; but the real defect lies in the motherboard. Read the reviews on cnet.com and pay special attention to those that own the laptop above a year; believe me, you won't think that this is the greatest thing since slice bread a year from now.

Title: Cools the area down nicely, but there are caveats
Content:
The unit does function very well, as far as actual cooling power goes.  However, like many other reviewers, I find that the auto-evaporate function is utterly inadequate.  I actually found this out the hard way, having ruined a carpet by running the unit for a week (in a rental apartment, naturally).  Tucked neatly in a corner, all on its own, I had not noticed the leak previously.
Well, after two months of not using this, the heat went way up again, so I drained the unit thoroughly, plugged it back in, and set it up in a room without a carpet.  45 minutes later, there was a puddle on the floor.  I promptly mopped this up, drained the unit again, and 15 minutes later noticed another puddle accruing.
I have also read that if the drain pan fills, the condenser is supposed to shut off.  Well, that does not appear to be the case for me.  This unit will happily flood my floors repeatedly.  I must resort to building some sort of scaffold to support the unit over a tub.  Hardly an ideal solution.
This all, I could live with, but the reason I ranked this unit at two stars rather than three, is that the manual is not very helpful in setting the unit up -- and while I generally do not use manuals, it recommended using duct tape to secure the widget to the window to seal out air gaps.  Duct tape?  In a rented apartment?  Are you insane!?   No way am I going to ruin the walls or paint, in addition to the carpet.  Glad I paid no attention to that one.

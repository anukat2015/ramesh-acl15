Title: burns up in 6-12 months
Content:
First off, I LOVE the coffee this machine makes, and the thermal carafe is GREAT--no burnt coffee taste you get with the burner plate models.  That said, I've gone thru two of these coffee makers in 17 months and won't get another.  With the first, after 6 months the pre-brew function timer stopped working.  I didn't use it much, so decided to live without that.  But 4 months later it stopped brewing entirely--it would "beep" it was done, but no coffee had brewed :-(  It was replaced--I had option of going with another brand/model but I stayed with this one, b/c, as said, I LOVE the coffee and the thermal carafe.  Now replacement, after 4 months, stopped working.  But this time I was there when it went bad--was brewing a second pot of coffee and smoke started pouring out the top of the machine.  It smelled like an electric fire.  I turned it off, unplugged, and poured cold water in the back, just in case that would help.  After that, it is dead--I tried turning it on again to see what would happen (we really wanted coffee), but it just "beeped" that it was done, with no brewing.  I don't know what burnt up, but I won't risk an electric fire with another one.  I'll miss the great coffee & the thermal carafe, so hope Cuisinart figures out the problem and fixes it for future models.  A coffee pot at this price should last a few years at least.

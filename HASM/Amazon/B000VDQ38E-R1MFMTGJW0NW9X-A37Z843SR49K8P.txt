Title: Starts out great, but broken in 14 months
Content:
What a waste of money. I loved this vacuum when it first arrived. It sucked up so much dust from the carpet it was a thrill to use it. But in just over a year, it started loosing suction. now it won't pick up a popcorn kernel using the hose right on top of it. Now, it also heats up the plastic parts to scary temperatures. I tried taking it apart but can't find the problem. Who can buy a new vacuum once a year? Probably better to spend more on something with a good, long warranty. Now I have to find out how to recycle this piece of junk, seems a terrible waste to take it to a landfill.

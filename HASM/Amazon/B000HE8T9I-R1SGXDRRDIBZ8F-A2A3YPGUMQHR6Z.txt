Title: Terrible vacuum
Content:
This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned. It is so time consuming with the filters clogging up so fast and then having to clean them several times before it over heats and shuts off. You can't vacuum half the living room without it shutting off and that's with clean filters. This vacuum is junk! My 20 year old Eureka canister is better than this vacuum. I just replaced this Shark with a Dirt Devil Breeze and the Dirt Devil is far superior in suction. The Dirt Devil picked up an unbelievable amount more dirt and dog hair than the Shark did when it was new. The Shark was a complete waste of money.

Content:

No tax. 
free shipping.
@ at great price of just $999?
Con: not much.  minor stuff like resolution could of been higher.
Other Thoughts:  I've been keeping track of this laptop and notice Newegg had the same laptop going for $999.  However, Today Newegg's price jump on this laptop to $1099.  If you are from CA like me, you would have to pay taxes @ Newegg as well... However, Amazon give this baby to me at $999 with no tax!!!!  BUY IT SOON if you havn't!! The price might just get higher!!!!

Title: Really impressed!!
Content:
I did a lot of research before buying a new vacuum.  I wanted something that could deal with cat hair, but the bissell has far exceded my expections.  I was really not sure about the idea of going back to a bagless, since I had tried some of the first generation ones when they came out.  I can tell you that this bissell uses triple cyclonic, somewhat like the Dyson's use.  After the first room I realized just how terrible my old bag hoover was.  This thing is picking up dirt and hair that had been inbedded into the carpet for years.  I would recommend this vacuum to anyone, as I am so impressed with it.

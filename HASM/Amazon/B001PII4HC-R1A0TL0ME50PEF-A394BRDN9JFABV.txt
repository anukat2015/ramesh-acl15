Title: Fashion Statement Only
Content:
I love gadgets and technology in general. I own several netbooks, some of which I have purchased through Amazon.com. 
That being said, if you wish to make a fashion statement, buys one of these. They look great!  The performance on the other hand is sub par at best.
The start up time is painfully slow.
The interface for conectabilty is cumbersome, slow, and rigid.
Worst of all. . . the text is nearly unreadable. I have great eyesight. But, I need binoculars to read the text on this thing. 
Conclusion: If you want to impress someone, show them this piece of eye candy. But, don't turn it on. They will laugh at you!!!!!!!!!!

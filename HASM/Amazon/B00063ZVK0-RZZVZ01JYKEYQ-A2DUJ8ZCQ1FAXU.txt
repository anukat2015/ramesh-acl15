Title: Excellent heater.......if you only need it for one season
Content:
I purchased this Vornado heater because of the name.  I use Vornado fans in the summer, so I expected the same quality in a heater.  I used it in the basement, a slightly heated room.  It warmed a 12 x 18 basement very, very well - I was very impressed with the warm air circulation.  However, the fan just stopped working.  Just.....stopped working.  Of course, it was after the year warranty was up. I really want to buy this heater again because it worked so well, but I'm afraid of it breaking again, which is why it only got 2 stars.

Title: New Mighty Mite Vac a Worthy Successor to its Predecessor
Content:
When my original Electrolux Mighty Mite finally gave up the ghost after over 20 years, I was happy to see that there was a successor model that was getting rave reviews.  So I bought the 3670G (the 12-amp model) and can report that those rave reviews are warranted.  I love:
   - the powerful suction;
   - the light weight;
   - a long handle that means I don't have to stoop;
   - the compact design;
   - that there's no beater-bar to damage my oriental rugs;
   - the low price;
   - that the attachments from my original Mighty-Mite fit this one.
The latter's important because the one thing I don't like about the 3670G is the attachments.  The included floor attachment works fine on my wood floors, but doesn't touch the pet hair in the rugs--so I'm glad to have my old floor brush attachment.  The included dusting attachment has short artificial fibers and is neither as gentle on finishes nor as effective as the better quality horsehair version I bought as a replacement to fit my old Mighty Mite.  
Attachments aside, this is a highly portable, very powerful machine at a very affordable price and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.

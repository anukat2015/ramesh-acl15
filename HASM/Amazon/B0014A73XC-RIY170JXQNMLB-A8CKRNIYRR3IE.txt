Title: Writing my review from this computer!
Content:
Ok I just love my artist edition HP, I used to own a black regular dv2000 and I had a lot of problems with that one, I had to sent it for repair and everything and, I don't know.. overall I didn't have a good experience with that one...
But I traded my old one with my dad and bought this artist edition just crossing my fingers hoping this one to be a keeper, and IT DEFINITLY IS!
No webcam problems (other one worked 1/3 times I tried using it), the touch buttons are more resposive, the touchpad buttons feel more rigid...
And the desing on the computer makes it unique!
So its fully recommended!

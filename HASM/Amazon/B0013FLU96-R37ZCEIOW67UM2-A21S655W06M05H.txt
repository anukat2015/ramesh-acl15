Title: MacBook Pro 2.5 GHz 4GB RAM
Content:
I use the MacBook Pro 2.5 GHZ for graphics processing with Adobe Photoshop CS4. I can process files in the 500MB size using high resolution scans of 4x5 and 8x10 sheet film from an Epson 4990 Photo Pro scanner. I have the MacBook Pro connected to a 23 in. Apple Cinema Display via the DVI output on the laptop. I upgraded the RAM to 4 GB by purchasing the Kingston 4 GB package sold on Amazon.com for approximately $50., instead of the $300 upgrade from Apple. The entire system works flawlessly and it fills my needs for fast, accurate image editing. What more can I say? I'm quite satisfied with the entire working system.

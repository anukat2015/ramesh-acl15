Title: Broke in less than 90 days DO NOT BUY
Content:
I have a "Zojirushi EC-BD15 Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker" from Amazon.com on December 13, 2004.  At first the unit worked well and we were very happy with it.  In the past week the unit has stopped working.  Seems that it starts to brew and stops before the pot is completely brewed.  Most times it only brews one or two cups and stops brewing.  If we start brewing again it well brew another one or two cups and then stop again.  I can no longer brew a complete pot.  
I can no longer return is since it's past Amazon's 30-day return policy.  I have contacted the manufacturer, but their offices are in Japan so I cannot imagine I'll be sending it to them for exchange.  So I'm stuck with a $70 piece of junk.

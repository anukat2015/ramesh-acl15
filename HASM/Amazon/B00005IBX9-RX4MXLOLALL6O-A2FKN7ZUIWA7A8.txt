Title: Bought for looks but. . .
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker based upon appearance and the positive reviews.  I wish that I would have seen it in a store before making my purchase.  The controls and time display are very small and difficult to read.  The on-off switch is a small metal pin-like toggle switch that feels flimsy.  The time display is tiny and inset so that at countertop height you can't read it.  You can't read any of the controls without bright light and practically putting your nose on the coffee maker.  I also found the operating instructions to be lacking.  The coffeemaker comes with a gold-toned filter and a few paper filters.  Can I use the gold-toned filter alone without paper?  Seems like a simple question but the instructions don't even mention the gold-toned filter.  As for looks, it's ok but not great.

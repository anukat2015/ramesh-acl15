Title: WHERE THERE'S LIGHT THERE'S HEAT!
Content:
If you want heat, this one's for you. It puts out more heat at 400 watts than most 1500 watt heaters, so it'll cost far less to run. I haven't even set it on high (800 watts) because I haven't needed to. Some may object to the light it emits but that's like complaining about the sun because it's too bright if you stare at it. You can set it up peripherally or at a slight angle away from your direct vision, avoid the light and still get plenty of heat. Buy this now while it's on sale and you can get free shipping. I don't know how long these halogen bulbs last, but it really does the job.
UPDATE (11/07):
After using this for two years, it's easily paid for itself. However, I bought one for a friend and it and its replacement (covered by Soleus under warranty) were defective. The third one she received seems to be OK, however she prefers the Presto Parabolic Heater since she claims it heats a wider area and doesn't emit as much light. The Presto costs half again as much ($75), may do slightly better but also uses more electricity, so figure out what's right for you. I should add I don't use the Soleus at night, it's less intrusive and more efficient to use an electric blanket instead.

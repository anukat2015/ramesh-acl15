Title: Great product!
Content:
I have owned a Bissel and a Dirt Devil before deciding that it time to stop fooling around and get myself a REAL vacuum that would keep the house clean and not lose suction completely in less than 2 years. So I decided for a factory refurbished Electrolux, thinking that I can get away with both minimum pay and a great product. I was wrong. Later I went to Lowes to try a new Electrolux Oxygen and make sure that my disappointment was not related to the mere fact that my order was factory refurbished. It wasn't. The Electrolux was bad because it was bad period. I decided for Miele - my last hope. If that wasn't gonna do it, nothing was going to. Despite being the least expensive among the Miele models, this  vacuum is an absolutely great piece, better than any other vacuum I tried, including more expensive ones from other brands. It is sturdy, it is very well made, it screams quality and it does the job as an excellent vacuum should. All other brands look like garbage compared to this one. The only downside may come for those who have really big houses and would need to step up to a larger model, which in Miele terms can be a bit pricey. Otherwise - superb product!!!

Title: Great suction, but heavy & awkward
Content:
We ended up returning this vacuum as it definitely has great suction, but the trade off is the small bag (it's bag is smaller than my hand held vacuum!).  Plus, it was difficult to turn and get into small areas.  Can't beat the price, so if you had a large area that didn't need much navigating and you were only vacuuming occasionally, it may be just what you need.  Otherwise, it may be worth the few extra bucks to get something more user friendly.

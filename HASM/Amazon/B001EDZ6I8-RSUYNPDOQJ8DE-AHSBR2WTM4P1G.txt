Title: Reasonably good
Content:
I've had this product for about a year now. Unlike a few other reviewers, I've never had a problem in terms of reliability. The unit has operated without a hiccup since I purchased it. It basically does what it is advertised to do: warm your feet. So, on that point, I have no complaints. But, you should not consider the Vornado  a substitute for a space heater. Right under my desk is fairly warm, but the heat does not travel much further than a foot. Thus, if my room is cold, my hands will stay very, very cold. This isn't a necessarily complaint against the unit--even though the product description says "personal space heater," the more detailed description clearly states the unit is designed to warm the feet and legs (I would say it warms the calves).
During the warmer days, I use the heater as a footrest. It serves that purpose well, and I like the little bumps, which are meant to provide passive massage. However, I find that it's very easy to hit the on/off switch and other buttons accidentally. So, I've had to unplug it when I didn't need the heat. Not a problem, though. Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars -- I would rate it higher but the temp is just a little too little. I'd like for it to be just a tad warmer.

Title: Sanitaire--Small Vac That Packs a Punch!
Content:
The Sanitaire by Eureka is one of the best vacuums I have owned.  In my opinion, it beats my previous vacuum which costs 4X more (Dyson).  This vacuum is very small and lightweight, but somehow has enormous suction power.  I bought the commercial model for durability.

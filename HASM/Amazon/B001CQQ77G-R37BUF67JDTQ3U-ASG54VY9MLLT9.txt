Title: this is an excellent product so far
Content:
since i started using this heater last week, it has proven to be an excellent choice.  it is quiet, easy to use, attractive and functional.  it does not get hot on the top or sides or even the front glass door, even on the highest setting.  the temperature gauge works great and helps to save energy.  it heats up a large basement guest room well and even after switching the heater off and unplugging it before sleeping, i noticed that the room stays nice and cosy through the night.  granted, it is may and not january but so far i am very happy that i chose this heater!

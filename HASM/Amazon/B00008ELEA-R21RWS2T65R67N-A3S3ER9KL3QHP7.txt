Title: Best little coffee pot in Texas
Content:
I bought the smallest size, it will brew 2-4 cups. I had a larger one, just like this one, for 30+ years and it lasted till recently when a friend turned it on without water and burned up the water heater.  
I was so happy to find this one on Amazon, and my friend is forbidden to use the new pot to make coffee. He replaced the old one with a plastic coffeemaker from Target and it is terrible. He will need to order another Farberware from Amazon if he wants a good pot. A good pot is important.

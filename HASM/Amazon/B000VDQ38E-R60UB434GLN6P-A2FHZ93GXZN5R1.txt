Title: Would not recomend
Content:
Carpet hight adjustment does not work right out of the box.  Power cord exits to low so you always have to reach way down to get it.  Power switch in on the mid level front of the machine and not on the handle.  Hose is such that you have to always reverse the couplings in order to use it easily. As usual with many brands it comes as a pile of parts.  It does have good suction but, that is about all.  A total waste of $150 and going back to a Hoover again.

Title: very useful coffeemaker
Content:
I've had this coffeemaker for about 3 weeks.  It brews a good cup of coffee in a minimum of time, is easy to use and to clean, and is perfect for one person in either a home or an office setting.  The unit does make a fair amount of noise, so may not be suitable for some applications, but if you're looking for an inexpensive coffeemaker for one person, this may be it.  Permanent filter and stainless steel mug with plastic interior.

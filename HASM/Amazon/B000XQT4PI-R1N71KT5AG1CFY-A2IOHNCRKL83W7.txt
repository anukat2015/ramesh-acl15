Title: Can't live without it
Content:
OK, so my title is probably melodramatic but I love my Sansa Clip! This is my 3rd Sansa clip although my children have other various Sansa models that we also like.  (The 1st one still works fine but the clip broke & I need the clip. I should mention that it broke under extreme circumstances, not everyday wear & tear.   The 2nd one was stolen so I had to come buy my 3rd one recently.)  I primarily listen to audiobooks (from [...]) while I cook, clean or do laundry, etc and having the clip is so handy.  I clip it to the neck of my shirt and can easily access the player if I need to pause it.  I will say that the headphones are useless to us.  They don't fit comfortably for any single person in our house (from toddler to adult) so we just don't use them.  The Sansa Clip is easy to use.  It's compatible with [...] but I can also easily upload music.

Title: Excellent!
Content:
Having much experience with DSLR's over the past three years, I was initially reluctant in plunking down my money for the K100D having used Nikon almost exclusively.  To my surprise, it is a great entry level DSLR and affords the serious amateur great IQ, shake reduction (about two stops), low noise at high ISO's, and superb handling along with great build quality.  The kit lens is a few notches above many other kit offerings and the camera really shines when using one of the Pentax prime lenses and their better quality zooms.  The Pentax line up is very satisfactory and the lenses are extremely good and rather inexpensive when compared to the Canon and Nikon selection.  Has to be the best deal in current DSLR offerings!

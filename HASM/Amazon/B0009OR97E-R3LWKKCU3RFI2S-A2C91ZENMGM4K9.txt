Title: metro vac
Content:
A little dynamo. It's powerful, but it  won't exactly suck the chrome off a trailer hitch (to coin someone else's phrase). Very light weight. Rolls really  well. I have 2 complaints: You have to stoop down to  turn it on,  and the power carpet nozzle is too high to fit under my sofa. But, overall I am pleased. Good value for the money. Sleek, looks like a little rocket on wheels! Best of all it is AMERICAN MADE!!!

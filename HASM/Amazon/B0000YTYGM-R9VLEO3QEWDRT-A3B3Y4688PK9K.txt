Content:
We just recently purchased this Cuisinart coffee maker, after much hesitation.  I really wasted a lot of time that I could have been enjoying this coffee maker. I was not sure if it would fit under my cabinets, but it not only fits but looks great also. My husband works different shifts of 12 hours each, our schedules are really crazy, however I can get up two hours later and the coffee is just as good and as hot as when he made it earlier.  It never has that cooked stale coffe taste.  The only problem we have that the coffee is so good I wish it held 14 cups instead of 12.  You will certainly enjoy this coffee maker, especially you shift workers out there!

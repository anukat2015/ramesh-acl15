Title: New Look, But Same Old Mr. Coffee
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker because of the price, appearance and features.  I was disappointed to learn that the coffee still takes an unreasonable amount of time to brew as was the case with other Mr. Coffees I have owned.  The swing out basket is 'temperamental' and tricky to put back on.  The feature that allows one to sneak a cup while still brewing does not work. It does keep the coffee reasonably hot for an automatic drop maker and the price is right comparatively speaking.

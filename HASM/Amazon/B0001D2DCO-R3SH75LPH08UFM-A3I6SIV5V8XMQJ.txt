Title: Run away - terrible warranty policy!
Content:
DeLonghi portable AC is a rip-off of unsuspecting consumers. Mine broke in a month and a half! And here is the best part. To get it fixed under warranty, I would have to ship it on my own expense to a service center in New Jersey, which, giving the weight and fragility of this thing, would cost me a small fortune. Basically, for all practical purposes, this is an expensive product with no warranty. I was lucky the seller took it back for a full refund. 
It works quite well when it does, though.

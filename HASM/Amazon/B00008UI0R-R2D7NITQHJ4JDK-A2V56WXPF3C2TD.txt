Title: Agreat little machine
Content:
I bought this vacuum for the upstairs only, but it works soooo well that I keep bringing it down to the rest of the house.. It works great on carpets and floors.. I live with kids and three dogs and it really does a great job... Had it for three years so far!! The only thing I wish, was the canister being bigger.. You do need to empty it out a lot.. So carry a garbage bag with you.. and enjoy the power this little machine gives....

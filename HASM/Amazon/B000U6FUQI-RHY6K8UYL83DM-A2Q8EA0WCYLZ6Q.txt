Title: Good for tile or wood floors
Content:
It's not a vacuum cleaner! It is pretty good at picking up dust and pet hair from flat floors such as tile.  It will pick up threads and strings but not a paper clip or pasta.  It is easy to control and navigate.  Since it does what I need it to do, I gave it a good rating, however, there are a few things you should consider.  It is not good on rugs, except mats and very low pile rugs like kitchen mats.  It gets close to baseboards but not corners.  It is lightweight.  It empties easily.  On the negative side, you can't tell how much charge you have left and the charger base light is always on so you don't know what's going on there either.  Since I got it at about half price, I am satisfied with it since I can't bend or lift very well due to back problems and I have a lot of tile floors.  Did a great job on the pet hair, I have two short haired dogs.  Would not have been happy with it if I paid full price.  It's an improvement on the previous model of DD broom vac since it doesn't clog up like the old type.

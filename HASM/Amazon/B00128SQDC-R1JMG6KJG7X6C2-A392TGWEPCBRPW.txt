Title: Great Value used these days, not so great new
Content:
There are scores of reviews about the D80 on here, so I'll try to just add relevant information for someone buying this body *now*
If you're buying this body today, I'd suggest buying it for no more than ~650 or so if you can, or even better, buy it used from a reputable source for under 600.  The new D90's are coming out soon, and though I love my D80 dearly, it just doesn't make sense to be paying 700+ for this big guy anymore. If you *need* to buy a dslr camera *now* you're probably better off just renting one from a pro camera store.

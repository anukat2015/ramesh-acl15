Title: You get what you pay for.
Content:
If you live in a hot climate where temperatures reach over 90 you should be aware that these types of coolers are only slightly better than a standard Fan. I have this model and 2 others and they work about the same.(slightly better than a standard fan). If this is all you need then this is a good product. I have had it for over a year and have had no problems. It is also quite and light.

Title: not perfect
Content:
i have had this player for about 2 weeks now.  i guess for the money its worth it but it has its cons. 
*first off, its very easy to move files to it (which, after having a zune and an ipod touch, this was the main selling point for me).
*the clock just wont, no matter how many times i reset it, keep the correct time.  i wish i could turn this feature off because i dont even really need it.  it also only keeps military time, no way to fix this.
*its very light-weight and seems it will break easily if dropped.
*the headphones are nice.  
*the feature that allows you to play the music through the stereo is nice, but i have an aux cable so i dont need to use it.  
*i dont really like the off switch, its small and might break easily.
*the fact that i can pick it up and view it right-side-up no matter how i hold it is awesome.  
*the "system information" option doesnt display any info if i click on it.  i would love to know how much space i have taken up so far.
*the wallpapers are pretty useless. i wish i could set a picture to it.
all in all, a good product for the money, but be ready for some little headaches

Title: This vacuum blows..
Content:
I purchased this vacuum about 5 mos. ago and I so hate it.  It seems to have weekly "issues" where the "bag full" light will come on causing the vacuum to stop.  Of course, the bag never actually gets full because the suction is not great.  Cheaper vac's have done a much better job. I regret spending the money on this.

Title: Liked the first so much I bought 2 more!
Content:
Perfect little heater to warm a single room.  We use it to help keep the living room warm during the cold winter.  We live in a older house with drafty windows and our heating system can get a workout on the coldest of winter nights.  This heater keeps the living room warm and reduces the amount of time the thermostat has to go on.  I thought the first one was so good, I went ahead and bought two more from Amazon.  To my surprise, the price had actually gone down $5 when I purchased the other two units.  This is an unbeatable value for under $20.  We use the extra heaters to help warm the bathrooms in the morning or before we give our kids a bath.  And the units are so portable you can move them around the house as needed with little effort.
The only minor drawback is the difficulty in seeing the markings on the dials, as has been stated by several other reviewers.  But, just turn it up to high to warm to room initally and when you reach your desired comfort level, just dial back the thermostat until it clicks off.  You never even really have to look at the dials because you'll get a feel for it.
Overall a great little unit at an unbeatable price.  One of the best purchases I've ever made from Amazon.

Title: OK, but "loses its mind" now and then
Content:
I have had the Hunter 44110 for a number of years, and it basically does the job. But, once or twice a month it completely loses the day, time and program, and has to be completely re-programmed. When this happens, I check or replace the batteries. But it still loses memory even with known good batteries.

Title: very pleased
Content:
I did lots of research before buying and am very happy with this product. This is my first SLR and have spent last couple of months learning everything i need to know. Go to dpreview.com to see the indepth review of this guy. Canon has the best image quality out of everyone. Great product at a great price - no need to spend extra money on the higher end cameras unless you photograph for a living. This camera did better in some image quality tests than the 40D.

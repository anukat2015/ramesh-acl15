Title: Awesome camera....NICE quality!
Content:
I have owned several digital cameras (still do) and I recently purchased the Nikon D60. I absolutely LOVE IT! No complaints! We are normal people who enjoy taking pics of our kids and outings. The quality is AWESOME! Yes, it is a little pricey however, if you are able to afford it, I would highly recommend buying it! Lots of extra accessories for it too! Takes GREAT pictures, print quality is awesome as well and the items it comes with is good for normal people. No need to buy anything extra unless you want to. We did, however, buy an extra flash for night picture taking. Will NEVER buy another normal digital camera! DSLR's are it for me!

Title: Hoover WindTunnel canister vac
Content:
I LOVE this vacuum.  It is lightweight and easy to maneuver.  I sold my Dyson which was heavy and cumbersome to get this vacuum.  It has great suction.  My only wish was that the OFF button was somewhere other than on the hose as I often hit the off button by mistake.

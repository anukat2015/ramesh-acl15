Title: Not thrilled
Content:
It's almost as though they never expected me to vacuum up pet hair with it!  I have only 1 lab who I give shed treatment regularly...and I vacuum every other day.  What a big surprise that EVERYTIME I use it I have problems.  Clogged filters on a vacuum recommended for pet hair?  I empty it after every use - WHAT A MESS!  I keep out my other vacuum to vacuum up after I empty the pet hair eraser.  It's heavy...the hoses are always disconnecting...the tools stink.  I cannot think of anything nice to say about this vacuum.  Oh, I guess it does a satisfactory job on the rugs, but certainly not worth he trouble and mess that it creates.  I will be replacing ASAP.

Title: Gross
Content:
The suction is decent, i have had it for almost 2 years now and it works pretty well. You have to clean it often and you have to go over the same spot back and forth for a while to actually pick up as much dirt as other stronger vacuums, you also have to clean it pretty often and wait until the whole thing is dry before using it. And when dirt gets into the chamber i have to STICK my hand in it and pull all of the dirt OUT, making my hands full of dirt, so gross!...It doesn't clean under my bed so I am looking at other vacuums that are more versatile, not an upright. I set it at the floor setting to clean a low carpet, and its so hard to pull back and forth, just a pain.

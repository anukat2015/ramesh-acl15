Title: Great heater when there's an ice storm
Content:
We borrowed a Big Buddy heater during the 2009 ice storm. Big Buddy kept the front rooms comfortably warm. Being without power for three weeks because most of the power lines, poles and transformers were broken from the weight of the ice, it was time to order one of our own from Amazon. This was the best price anywhere. Hooking the unit to our BBQ grill propane tank with an adaptor hose saved dollars on fuel.

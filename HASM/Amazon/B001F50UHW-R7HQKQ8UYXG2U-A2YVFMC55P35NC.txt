Title: Sony 4 GB Walkman MP3 Player
Content:
The Sony 4 GB MP3 player seems perfect for my use on my daily walks.  The cost of a player with more memory is unwarranted unless video is your objective.  I have 130+ songs on it with plenty of memory left.  The battery life is superb.  There are several options to copy music to it whether a novice or more advanced. The sound it produces is adequate with the included earbuds but of course quality can be improved with a more expensive set.  I am not disappointed with any of the descriptives as advertised.  I find with the shuffle feature I never tire from listening to my genre of music with the relatively "few" songs I already have.

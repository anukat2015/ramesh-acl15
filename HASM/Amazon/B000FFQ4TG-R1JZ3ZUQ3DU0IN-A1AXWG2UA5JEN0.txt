This is by far the best coffee maker I have ever used. This is not a "disposable" unit. If you buy it you can count on years of perfect operation. If you get others, even good brands like Cuisinart, you cannot count on these to do anything but dissapoint because this item is just short of commercial quality. I bought one for my elderly parents 3 years ago, and with an annual cleaning for mineral deposits, it still works like the first day they got it. Makes an entire pot of coffee in less than 2 minutes. It has a ceramic heating surface that is easy to clean. Above all, it makes a perfect cup of coffee! You will not regret your purchase!

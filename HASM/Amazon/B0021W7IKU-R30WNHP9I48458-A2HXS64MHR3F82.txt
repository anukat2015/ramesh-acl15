Title: Great Laptop for the road!
Content:
I ordered this laptop for my son so he could take on the road with him for his work or when on vacation. I had it sent to my house so I could load some software I had ordered. I also ordered some other things to go with the laptop like a carrying case. I played with the laptop for a few days until everything arrived and I thought it was an excellent purchase. It appeared to very sturdy - good for taking it on the road. It was pre-loaded with Windows XP Professional but has Vista Home Premium backup licensed for the PC.  It had an option to upgrade to Windows 7 if you prefer that.
I have sent everything to my son in the meantime and he has used for a couple of weeks. He is using it wirelessly in his home but has not taken it on the road at this time. Everything seems to be working smoothly. He also has a wireless HP printer that he has been using with the laptop with great results. 
I would recommend this computer to anyone who needs a solid computer to take on the road.

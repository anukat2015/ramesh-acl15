Content:
Reading the other reviews on bag change so often, I still decided to purchase this bad boy.  My mother has an old school electrolux that she bought refurbished back in 1989 and still uses today.  
Alright changing of the bag will occur for very often , actually every time I cleaned(once a week) my apartment(900sqft)...THe little bad boy was just doing its job..my carpet must have been disgusting and so is everyones carpet that complained about changing bags so often//now i only change bags about once every 2 months.my carpet is clean, allergies are gone..all for 100 bucks..u will not be disappointed.

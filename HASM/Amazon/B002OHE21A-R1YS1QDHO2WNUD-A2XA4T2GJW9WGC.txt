Title: DeLonghi HHP800 Mica-Panel Space Heater - Love it!
Content:
I bought this heater for my bedroom (15x24) and it works perfectly.  The first couple of nights I was so warm I had to get up to turn it down.  The 6 thermosat settings work very well.  I love that it is silent - but of course that also means that it does not heat the room quickly (takes about 30-60 minutes).  My wife now moves this heater to her office each day to stay warm.  I would definitely recommend this heater to anyone looking to efficiently heat a room in their home.

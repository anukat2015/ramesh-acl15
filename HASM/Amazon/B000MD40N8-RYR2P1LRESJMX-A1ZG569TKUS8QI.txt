Title: Not bad, if you're a windows user... okay otherwise
Content:
If you use WMP and use it to sync with the Sansa Express, this is a nice device.  You can create playlists and organize files nicely.
But... If you're using the SE as a USB drive under any other OS, or just don't want to use WMP, it's a pain in the neck --- the Express ignores any directory structure you place the files in, and you cannot create playlists (like m3u's) by hand.
That said, I like the rechargeable battery feature and the fact that I don't need a cable to connect it to my PC --- makes it perfect for use while riding my bike to/from work.
So, it'll do for what I am using it for, but as a general purpose MP3 player for someone NOT using WMP, I think it needs a few firmware changes.

Title: Good value for the money
Content:
I wanted a second vacuum to keep upstairs and for use on carpets.  I found this one for about $99.00.  I read the reviews for the Bissell 3910, and although this isn't the same, it is very similar.
I was amazed at how much pet hair and dust this vacuum collected after I had already vacuumed with my canister vac.  I think it does a really good job.  I also like the 35-foot cord, which means I can plug it into one outlet for the entire upstairs.  I wanted a bagless, because the cost of bags would be a lot given how much dog hair I have to deal with.  The container is easy to remove and clean.
You have to be careful with things like curtains, bedspreads, and such that may be in contact with the floor, because its suction is powerful.  It is also a bit loud for my liking, but not horrible.
I have not tried it on bare floors, so I can't give an opinion about that.  I would recommend this vacuum for anyone who likes a good value.

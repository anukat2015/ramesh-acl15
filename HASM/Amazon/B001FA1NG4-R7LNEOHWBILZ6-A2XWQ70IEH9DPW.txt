Title: Great 4th gen Nano
Content:
I already loaded 400 songs and can probably load 1600+ more.  Easy to use once you get used to it. Purple color is beautiful also.. Start up manual that comes with it is not great so be sure to download the complete users guide - 
Sounds great - can't wait to get fm transmitter to use it in my car!  I like it better than my Grandson's ITouch.

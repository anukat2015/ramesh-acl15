Title: Just Incredible!
Content:
I've just received my AV 700 and had a chance to put it through its paces.  I prepared some of my videos, and downloaded them, with some music and photos.  Video playback is just beautiful.  
I've read the other reviews, and I have had NONE of the problems described in any of them.  After changing the AV700 to a "hard disk" from its default ID, I was able to successfully connect it to my WinXP PC.  I had to try a couple of different USB ports, for some strange reason, but I don't consider that a problem
I get fine sound, excellent picture quality, good all around responsiveness, and am please with the unit.  It has excellent construction quality.  
I've ordered a second battery, but I figure that's just common sense.  
Archos has done their homework, and they have a first rate product.
UPDATE:
If anything, I feel even more upbeat about the AV 700 than I did when I first wrote the review.  For example, attention to detail: The relevant buttons on the remote are identical to those on the unit (plus of course the buttons to control other devices, TV, etc.).  
I'm 65, and intuitive familiarity with all these new gadgets doesn't come easily, but it surely has for the AV 700.
Also, I note that "Gadget Guy," Matthew Wy, who wrote a very downbeat review, has written 4 reviews, all of them on Archos products, and strangely enough, all 4 identical.  I mean verbatim!  Except for one missing sentence in one of the reviews.  Food for thought!

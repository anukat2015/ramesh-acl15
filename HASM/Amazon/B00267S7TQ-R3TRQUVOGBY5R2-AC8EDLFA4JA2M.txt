Title: Nikon deviating from making great cameras
Content:
I am extremely disappointed that Nikon has decided to thrown everything into the camera body.
If I wanted to get a camera that did video, I'd buy a video camera. A camera with better zoom, better handling comfort, ability to record long periods of time.
Video on NIKON SLR is not good, it does not have the focusing of a traditional video camera.  How bout watching a video where everything in the background is blurry? But that is not the point.
I want a semipro or cheaper camera made by a company that is dedicated to auto focus speed, better sensors, faster photo processing, etc.  Id rather see Nikon put more effort in making extreme zoom lenses cheaper than fool around with video.  What happened with the additional clear pixel sensor that Kodak developed a couple years ago?  Why isn't Nikon jumping on that?
good grief Nikon..are you giving up on making a great camera?
You still have a long ways to go on the CAM. There are too many CAM 1000s out there. How about CAM 5000,,,let make some progress instead of stalling with stupid video additions. 
Maybe Nikon  can put the following into the camera as well:
itunes
3G internet access
a taser
text messaging
and a compartment for a raincoat
yah that will be a nice DSLR!  NOT!

Title: pretty nice
Content:
i just bought this macbook pro online to replace my older powerbook which crashed. i am generally happy with the product. the screen is the biggest difference immediately, its flat screen pops out in comparison to my older powerbook. otherwise in an overall look it looks just like the powerbook..so i was a bit disappointed...was hoping there was some new styling from the few years apple has had to make design changes. its just when u upgrade to something u kinda want a new look..and this does not have that.
the overall working of the macbook is great. sound quality superb and i LOVE the isight addition. the clarity and sound are really great and i have been web chatting with family and friends who have also noticed the difference from the other seperate web cam i had before. so, a nice addition.
weight wise...still feels the same. battery heat wise still feels the same. keyboard still the same except for the new back lighting which senses when in darkness..so thats cool.
so, for a week of using, so far so good!

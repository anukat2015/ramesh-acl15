Title: Almost perfect
Content:
I did lots of research before purchasing this vacuum cleaner.  This purchase was made to replace my Sears kenmore vacuum cleaner that I had for about 5 years.  The suction is better than the Kenmore.  It is smaller and quieter than the Kenmore - the only drawbacks are the slightly shorter extension cord and the on board attachments - they don't all fit with the vacuum cleaner.

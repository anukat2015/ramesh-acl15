Title: Nice heater but ...
Content:
This heater is nice and does heat a room real nice, but the heater does use a lot of power. On the low speed it uses 750 watts at 6.5 amps, on the high speed it uses 1500 watts at 12.5 amps, so if you use the heater and say a wide screen TV that draws about 4 amps, it will trip your 15 amp circuit breaker (normal in most homes). The solution to this is to make sure the receptacle that your plugging this heater into is on a different circuit than other appliances like TV, computers etc...Since most homes are wired in such a way that all the receptacles that are in a particular room (say family room) are on one circuit breaker, you will not be able to watch your wide screen TV and have the heater on the high setting unless you have a 20 amp circuit breaker and even then you won't be able to use much of any other electrical devices. 
 The low setting will work with other electrical devices but the output of the heater may not heat a room the way you may expect or it takes a little longer to reach your particular comfort level.
 Overall, it is a good heater. I say "good" not a "WOW! This is awesome!" heater because of the power consumption.

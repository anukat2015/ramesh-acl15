Title: 3rd machine in three months
Content:
I'm giving this product two stars only because I love the Keurig concept. I love the coffee, the convenience, and the variety of k-cups. Realistically though, the quality of the product makes it worthy of only one star. I was actually impressed to see some people getting 15 months out of the B-60. We have had to return our first two machines after a month of use each, and are now on our third. 
I can't completely say that I don't recommend this product, because I like it enough to keep replacing the duds. My advice is, keep the receipt and keep the box, it makes returns and exchanges much easier.

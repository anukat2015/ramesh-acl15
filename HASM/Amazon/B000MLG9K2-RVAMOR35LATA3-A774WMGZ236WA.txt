Title: Be careful, be very careful.
Content:
Right at the top, let me say that I have never had good luck with cameras. That's why I turned to NIKON this time. Everything I had read was positive, and I didn't see how I could go wrong. Well, guess what?!
I have had my camera more than a month, and up until yesterday, I couldn't get the shutter to snap a picture with regularity. I have been on the phone with Nikon's 'tech' dept. in NYC (twice), and he couldn't figure out why either - other than to say, "the camera may be defective."
GREAT! My luck! Well, for whatever reason, yesterday I took the lens apart from the camera body. When I refit the lens, I 'snapped' it back in place so that it seated firmly. VIOLA!!!! Since then, the camera has performed beautifully! Every shot is super fast, super focused, and dead-on accurate. I am so tickled that it is working properly, because I am on vacation next week, and I have been worried sick that it wasn't going to work (after spending a considerable amount of money for a 'memory-taker').
I'll let you know in a future review if it held up.

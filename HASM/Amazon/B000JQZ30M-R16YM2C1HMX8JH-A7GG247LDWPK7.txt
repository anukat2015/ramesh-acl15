Title: Small but works great!
Content:
Very happy with this heater. Nice to look at, quiet and heats up a room quickly. I like the fact that you can set the temperature you want and can put it on a timer. I have been thinking of buying one for my Mother. Hope this heater will help supplement the cost of heat this year!

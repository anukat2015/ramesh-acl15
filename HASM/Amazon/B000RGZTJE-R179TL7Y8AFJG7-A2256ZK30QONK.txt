Title: A Learning Experience
Content:
This looked like a great deal, and I even drove 45 miles each way and picked up the unit WILL CALL.  While there I even bought 3 extra filters, planning on future use.  
What I didn't realize is the small fish aquarium motor that they use to pump a very small stream of water through a thin Nylon Fishnet "filter" would only last 9 days.  Fortunately the seller is replacing the unit for me [it's not their fault this unit is junk] but when it breaks again [in another week or two] I'll be out of luck on their warranty, and the Amazon warranty.
Spend your money on a Name Brand Cooler [as I'm going to do this weekend] and avoid "deals" that sound too good to be true.  They usually are.

Title: It worked great and then . . . . !
Content:
The air conditioner was very quiet and worked pretty good all season (July through early September in Seattle) and then suddenly a strong burnt electrical smell came out of the unit.  I unplugged it immediately and readied the unit for return - as it was still on warranty.  Before placing it in my car to return, I tipped it to drain the water out.  Big design flaw!  The plastic drain spigot is located at the bottom - just out of view if you are not on your hands and knees.  Tip the unit slightly to drain and the weight breaks the drain spigot off!  It did not look easy to fix!  I was glad I discovered this after the unti had already burned up inside!

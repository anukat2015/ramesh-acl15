Title: Worth the wait
Content:
What a quality Powerbook, I have bought every generation of Powerbook and iBook range...since the Wallstreet, and this version is simply the best.  My version was perfect and I did not have much of a wait. The machine is perfect with no dead pixels or faulty catches.  Like the advert for the two new models, I think you need to be in business or first class to put this beauty on your lap, without overhanging your neighbours coffee tray !  It will trun heads when the cabin lights are dimmed and the Powerbook keys light up.   Don't hesitate, buy this version its a classic, and if history is anything to go by... most macs hold their residual value better than its competitors.  Happy shopping.

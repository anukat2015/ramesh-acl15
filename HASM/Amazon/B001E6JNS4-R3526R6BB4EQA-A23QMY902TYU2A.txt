Title: Good but not great
Content:
The Rebel XS is a solid SLR but lacks a few features that I expected, but didn't think to ask about.  First, you can't fire a slave flash - there is simply no place to plug one in.  Second, exposure bracketing is limited to three shots, not the usually available five.  Finally, exposure bracketing is not an option when operating the camera remotely using a PC.  Shame on me for not knowing about these weaknesses before buying, but shame on Canon for not building them in.

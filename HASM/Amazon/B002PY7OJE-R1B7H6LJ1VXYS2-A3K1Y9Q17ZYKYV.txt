Title: Very nice PC - great size and weight + normal keyboard
Content:
This is my first personal laptop purchase in several years and have been putting it off, but when the price was so attractive for this nicely featured laptop (250 GB hard drive, 4 GB RAM, 6 cell battery + Windows 7) couldn't wait any longer.  It's performed very well for me.  I love the weight factor, long battery life, normal keyboard and am getting used to and liking the multi-touch mouse pad.  Overall, it's a great PC...only drawbacks are the fingerprint mark issue mentioned in other reviews and the fan noise is a little annoying.  I'm getting adjusted to Windows 7 OS and trying to find where MS moved stuff from Windows XP.  I would buy this again and recommend it to friends.

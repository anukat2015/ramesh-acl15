Title: Perfect for under the desk
Content:
I bought this because my office building is over air-conditioned and I usually have to thaw out by lunch!  This is an absolute perfect heater for under the desk. It's got an adjustable thermostat as well as a built-in safety feature in case the unit is tipped over. I have not experienced the unpleasant odor reported in another review. I would highly recommend this heater to anyone whose office or cube is too chilly.

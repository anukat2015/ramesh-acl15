Title: Shouldn't a heater, ummm, heat?
Content:
There are lots of things to love about this little heater - it's little, so its easy to store away when you don't need it, it looks nice enough, it has a remote thermostat.  But when I actually tried to use it, it blows my circuit breaker every time set on "high".  This is the third house I've had since buying this heater, and none of the three have any electrical problems.  Unless I try to run this heater on "high".  On "low", it moves some air but will not give off any heat whatsoever.
Going to find a radiator-style one that works...

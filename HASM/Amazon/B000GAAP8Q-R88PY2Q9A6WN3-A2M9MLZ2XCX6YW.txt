Title: I love this NANO - hate the earbuds....
Content:
The unit itself is amazing and I have no complaints with the exception of the earbuds. Apple can not design a quality earbud system. The earbuds will fall out with any movement and the sound is terrible. I did have to purchase a quality earbud system to compliment the Nano. You would think for what Apple charges for these Nano's they would upgrade the earbuds.

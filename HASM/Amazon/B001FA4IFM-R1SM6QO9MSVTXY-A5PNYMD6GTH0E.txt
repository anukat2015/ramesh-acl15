Title: poor thermostat
Content:
Poor thermostat - does not start heating at a setting 70 (low or high heat), but when set to 75, it does not stop heating. I regret I wasted money on it. DO NOT BUY!! I returned the first heater to Amazon for the same problem, the second does the same thing, and it's too late to return now.

Title: Warm but incovenient
Content:
I got this for my husbands cold home office for Xmas.  It's very warm and works well when he turns it on - but there isn't an on-off switch, and this seems to be very inconvenient for him, so he often doesn't turn it on.  If I was to do it again, I'd buy a heater  with an on-off switch instead.

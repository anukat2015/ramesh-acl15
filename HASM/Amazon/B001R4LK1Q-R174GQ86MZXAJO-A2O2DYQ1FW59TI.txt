Title: Should come with a roll of paper towels...
Content:
I'm so glad to see that others are experiencing the same issues with this unit that I am.  This machine is so messy the manufacturer should include a roll of paper towels with every purchase.  
What I like:
1.  Makes a nice cup of coffee
2.  Controls are simple to figure out
What I don't like:
1.  The spigot where the coffee is dispensed is located so close the machine that only a straight cup can get filled without spilling - even then you have to watch it carefully.
2.  It is so tall that I have to pull it to the edge of the counter to open the lid to fill with coffee and water.
3.  Open the lid - water spills
4.  Take out the coffee grounds tray - water spills
5.  Take out the coffee resevoir - water spills
6.  Fill the water resevoir - water spills
7.  Fill your curved cup or a travel mug - coffee spills
grrrrrrrrrrrrr
I wonder if this thing was ever tested by people that drink coffee regularly.  Some very poorly designed features make making coffee an exercise in patience.
I say, look around for something that isn't such a pain in the neck to use.

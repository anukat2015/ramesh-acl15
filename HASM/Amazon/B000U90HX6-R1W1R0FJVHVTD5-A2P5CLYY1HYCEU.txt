Title: Perfect Basement Heater
Content:
I have been absolutely thrilled with my Lasko ceramic heater.  Other reviewers were accurate when they described a foul smell coming from the machine during the first period of use, but this eventually went away and I was left with wonderful, powerful heat.  I don't find myself using the ionizer function, as I'm not even quite clear on what this function does, but the heater performs marvelously.  
One of my biggest concerns was with regard to the location of the heat coming from the unit, as we have a pet who likes to get a little too close to heat sources sometimes.  First, there is absolutely no heat coming from the back of the unit. This allowed me to place the unit right up against the wall without fear of it burning the wall behind the unit.  Second, the heat is dispersed from the top of the unit which can be adjusted from a 45-degree to a 90-degree angle, depending on your preference.
I really enjoy the thermostat feature and the ability of the heater to turn off once it reaches my desired heating level.
Finally, some reviewers have commented about the noise of the unit.  I find the heater to be quieter than an oscillating fan, even when the heater is used at full-strength.

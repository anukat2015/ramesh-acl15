Title: Exceed expectations
Content:
I have been talking for a while now about upgrading from the SLR to the DSLR.  I think my wife finally had enough of me debating with myself of when to make the jump so she did on my behalf.  I am an amateur photographer so can only speak from that viewpoint.  So far I have been very impressed by the quality of the shots.
I have been able to use my EOS lenses and the only thing they lack is image stabilization.  We have shot everything from close up birds to landscapes to Pelican's fishing.
For those wanting to make the jump to DSLR then this is a good camera.  For those already using a DSLR then do your homework to decide if this is a big enough advancement or wait till the next one comes along.

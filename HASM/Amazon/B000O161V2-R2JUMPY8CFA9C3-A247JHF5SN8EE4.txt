Title: A great introduction to SLR photography
Content:
This camera is very light, and has a large display screen. It takes outstanding photos in full auto mode, but is capable of incredible photos if you use the manual mode. I have never taken a class on photography; and yet I can adjust the exposure, shutter speed, and ISO with ease. This camera has allowed to me shot memorable photos that I am proud to show off!

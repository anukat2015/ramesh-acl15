Title: Good name, poor results
Content:
I purchased one of these units back in October for use in coastal Alabama where it doesn't get unbearably cold and despite following the iperating instructions to the T, I now have the same problems that many others have, the one with the oil leakage.  Mr Heater's web page has a nice little "contact us" page that hasn't worked for me yet, there is no repair place within 60 miles from here, and based on the number of "repeats" this problem has, even after repairing/cleaning it up, it'd be more expensive than it's worth.  I'd give a zero (0) star rating if I was able to, especially due to its cost.  I depise flushing $100 (heater and hose) down the toilet.  Mr Heater won't get any more of my hard earned money, that's for sure!

Title: Upgraded from rebel xt
Content:
I had my XT for over two years and was starting to feel the need to upgrade my camera. I did a ton of research before i finally decided to go with the 40D.
I have to say, when i first got my 40D, i was a bit overwhelmed by all of the new buttons i had to learn. Sitting down with the manual for about an hour helped me learn where everything was and what the new buttons do. I totally love how this camera is set up. I love the wheel!
This camera is very big compared to my rebel. And i love the way it feels in my hands. Sometimes my hand would cramp up with the rebel because i have long fingers. I dont have this problem with the 40D.
The camera takes amazing pictures.
The only thing i'm not crazy about is more often than not, there is a color cast on the preview screen. But there is no color cast on the pictures when they are uploaded to the computer. So its not a big deal, but it really freaked me out when i seen all my pictures had a blue cast in the previews. 
I look forward to many happy years ahead with my 40D.

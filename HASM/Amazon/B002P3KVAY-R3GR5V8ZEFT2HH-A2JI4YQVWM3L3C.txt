Title: Great computer for travel
Content:
I bought this netbook for travel. It is bigger than most netbooks but small enough to travel with. I bought a bag that doubles as a purse so I only have one bag to carry. The keyboard is great and the screen is a little bigger and easier to read. This product is well worth what I paid for it and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a smaller, lighter computer without loosing quality.

Title: Great for the bedroom
Content:
I've had this one for about 3 months now and must say that it works great. We turn ours on in our bedroom at night on just about high and so far we've only seen an increase of about $4 in our monthly power bill this winter. The last week or so with the temp. outside staying around 35 or so at night it keeps our larger sized master bedroom at about 75 degrees after it's been on for about an hour. It's not as powerful as the TRD0715T( which has 1500 watts' vs. the 0812T which has 1250) but honestly after about an hour I'm often waking up to turn the temp. down a few anyways on the warmer nights. On the nights this winter where we had about -5 degree weather leaving the unit on just about high kept the room at about 72 degree's even when we had the thermostat to the house turned down to about 60. It's great for rooms where you can close the door and leave it shut! 
     I've also seen several complaints about the unit getting hot....while yes it is a heater, you can still touch it. I've taken my hand several times and held it on the heater after it's been at high heat for about two hours and have been able to hold it for about 20 seconds before having to pull my hand away. While yes I'm sure it will scare a little one (we've got an 20 month year old in the room with us) and they will cry some in pain, I really don't think it would be enough to cause any marks on their skin. On that note however.....ours is tucked away in a corner and our eye's always are extra close on her whenever she's in that area.

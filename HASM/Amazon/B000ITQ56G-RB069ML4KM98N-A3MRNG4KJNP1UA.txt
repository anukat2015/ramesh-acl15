Title: Sumewhat inscrutable modus operandi
Content:
I had borrowed a Pelonix heater which was extremely easy to operate,could be set at temperatures varying by one degree increments, would remain in this mode until turned off, and was somewhat cheaper than the Lasko machine you shipped me which has none of these features. Please let me know if you carry the Pelonix line.  Robert Cryan

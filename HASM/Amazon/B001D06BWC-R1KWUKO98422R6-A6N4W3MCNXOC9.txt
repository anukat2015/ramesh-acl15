Title: What a great product!!!
Content:
I purchased the Archos 5 IMT for myself for Xmas.  Although I had higher expectations for the device, it is remarkably powerful for such a portable $200 PMP.  It is slower than my desktop, but more responsive than many laptops.
Screen quality is perfect.  Capacity is outstanding.  Elegant design.  Very portable; as long as your jeans are not skin tight they will fit in most pockets.  WIFI works great.
There are a few limitations with which I can easily live.  The Opera browser isn't as customizable as I would want it to be.  I haven't gotten the email client to work yet; but that's probably just me.  I never opened the earbuds because I never expect the free ones to be worth while.
If all you expect is a great video/picture viewer with enormous capacity, a very usable portable web browser, mp3 player, etc., then the Archos 5 imt is well worth the money.  I think I made a great purchase.   A++++++++++++

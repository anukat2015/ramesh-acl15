Title: Very good buy
Content:
I needed a quiet heater for my apartment. My friend has had one of these heaters for a number of years and was very happy about it. So instead of getting it from Amazon I tried to buy it locally. Turns out it's hard to find...so I made a big mistake and tried to buy heaters that looked to be similar. After buying 3 different heaters and wasting a lot of money I eventually did the right thing and bought this heater online from Amazon.
PROs
1) Quiet
2) Safe and reliable
3) Easy to use
4) 5 year warranty
CONs
1) Not the most amazing looking heater out there.
2) No bells-and-whistles (like a remote or flashing lights)
Oh, and here are some of the junk heaters I bought before I came to my senses:
A] Lasko heater bought from well known hardware store chain. Pretty stylish looking and cheaper than the Honeywell machine. Made in China it has a fancy LCD control which has a bright green backlight.
Only problem was that it creaked and banged as it heated up and cooled down. It was like someone was trying to open a door with a rusty hinge. As if that wasn't enough, the green backlight can't be switched off. So if you want a heater that creaks and bangs and comes with a built in nightlight, then this is the one for you. Oh, and 8 months later it stopped working altogether.
B] GE vertical fan heater with remote control. This was like having a jet engine in the room and really didn't heat the room up as fast as you'd think. In the end the remote control was a waste of time. They would have been better off including ear-protectors.

Title: Good unit, lousy support
Content:
As a previous poster noted, Amana does not acknowledge the existence of these rebadged Haier units on its site. Unfortunately, Haier also does not seem to acknowledge them, making support put-near impossible. The a/c unit does require a small window (or a large one largely blocked off) which can take some work if your windows are not the right size, but that's true of any unit like these. It is a very handy unit, without the need to empty buckets. It is also fairly noisy, with odd controls that require the remote. It was great the first year we had it, less so the second despite careful storage. You'd probably do better with a domestic-production (or European, or Japanese) unit if you can find one.

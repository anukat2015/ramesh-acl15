Title: Miele S5280 Pisces- great for hardwood/tile, not great for carpet or lots of rugs
Content:
I have used this vacuum for 8 months now and I love it.  My house is 1200 square feet and all tile throughout.  I have two dogs; one is non shed, and one is a light shedder.  The parquet floor attachment is awesome at picking up all dog hair, dust and debris and it turns and angles easily into tight spaces and around corners.  This canister vaccuum is very light and easy to pull around the house.  I do wish the electrical cord was longer.  I don't like the turbo brush at all; I use it on my 5 x 7, non wool, carpet type rug; it does clean the rug, but is very difficult to push on the rug and hair gets caught in the brush easily.  If you have carpet or lots of rugs there are other Miele vacuums to choose from which have different carpet/floor attachments, but also include the parquet brush for tile.  For me, the Miele suits my needs; definetly keeps the tile floors clean.  The suction on the vacuum is very good and the parquet floor brush has a nice large surface area.  It doesn't scratch the tile.  I imagine it would work just as well on travertine or wood floors.  A few times a year I look after a large, heavy shedding dog; I vacuum every day when she's here and the Miele Pisces pick up all of her hair easily.  Highly recommend if you have mostly or all tile/hardwood floors.  I used to have a Kenmore Progressive canister vacuum; I would use the little hardwood floor attachment on it. I enjoy the Miele so much more and I feel it keeps the house way cleaner and is easier to use.

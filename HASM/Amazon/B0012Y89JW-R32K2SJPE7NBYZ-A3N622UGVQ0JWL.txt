Title: One great camera
Content:
I waited a year for Canon to put their Digic 3 processor in a Rebel. The wait was worth it. The camera produces amazing results. The flexibility from a point and shoot to the macro to the full program mode is vast. I am a fan of the picture modes which all produce great shots. In particular I use the sports mode for shooting soccer shots. The continuous servo auto focus and shooting mean excellent results. The camera also feels great in your hands - just really well designed. The menus are easy to follow, and read on the large lcd, and arranged sensibly. You should buy this camera.

Title: Taking the "Espress" out of Espresso
Content:
Actually, for the money - less than $100 - you get what you pay for and about what you'd expect. The machine makes fine brewed coffee, and the espresso is acceptable too. And I'm hoping the ill-fitting plastic brew basket lasts at least a year.
My big complaint is that the machine is slooooooow. Making 4 cups of regular coffee takes twice as long as most comparable machines. Same with the espresso unit. AND, if the espresso blend is not medium grind (NOT espresso grind), you won't get anything at all -- a lesson I learned after returning first unit as 'defective.'
So, if you don't mind an extra wait, this unit - at this price - is fine.

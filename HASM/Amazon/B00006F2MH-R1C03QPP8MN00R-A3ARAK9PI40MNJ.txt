Title: Great Coffee
Content:
Boy
I must be missing something from the bad reviews. I received mine as a Christmas gift last year and have used it one or more times per day ever since:
1. Makes great coffee
2. reasonably easy to clean with sponge
3. Steam rising not an issue for me
4. Clean soon after use
Hints---use paper filters instead of the included metal filter
Make sure the filter door clicks shut correctly. I've had a couple instances where the filter door popped open but I think it's because I didn't shut it properly

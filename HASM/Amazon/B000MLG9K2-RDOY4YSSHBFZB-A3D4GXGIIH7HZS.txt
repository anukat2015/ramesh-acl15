Title: Perfect
Content:
It was between the D40 and the D90.  The D80 won.  It has all of the features a DSLR owner would want in their first camera.  I did not want to be upgrading in a year if I liked digital photography.  D40 can't do everything a DSLR lens wise should be able to do (great camera only a pro would run into this lens problem, 1k lens price and up type deal).  The D90 on the other hand only offered marginal benefits over the outgoing D80 but cost a D40 more.  The math presented me the D80, and after a month I love this camera and do not see myself replacing this camera for several years even when full frame FX digital reaches the more amateur  line of Nikon cameras.  Note to those considering the weight, this does weigh much more, a D40 will feel like a point and shoot around your neck after this has been hanging for a while.

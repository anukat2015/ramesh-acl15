Title: You can't please everyone all the time, but...
Content:
...the DC21 is an incredible machine.  What a wonderful "better mousetrap"!  First impressions, pros and cons are very similar to what I've read here and elsewhere:
Pros...
- Simply incredible suction.  This coming from a discriminating engineer, who honestly, had no idea what an "air watt" is, but I know now, and I like 'em!  I had just vacuumed the week before with a new Eureka unit marketed to have "60% more suction than Dyson", maybe only 600sf of carpet mind you, and emptied the Dyson container 3 times.  Not a lot of carpet fuzz, either, like I was afraid of based on hearing about how stiff the beater brissles are.  No, it was mostly light dust and gritty dirt.  Then, the wood floors.  With the included hard floors tool, they were cleaned MUCH more thoroughly with the Dyson, contributing even more bin-fulls to my earthen bounty.  Bravo!
- Exhaust air has absolutely NO odor.  Previous "HEPA" units I had used, both bagged and bagless, new or old, would always leave areas with that dingy, musky "vacuum" smell.  Clearly indicitave of the Dyson root cyclone hype actually being substantive.  As in, seriously a new and improved mousetrap, people!  This is my favorite feature.  I've got allergies so bad there are pictures of me in medical text(s) from my allergy testing.  That said, I can say there is nothing even close to matching what this unit accomplishes in the realm of filtration.  Also, I design healthcare (hospitals, operating rooms) HVAC for a living, so I KNOW filtration!  Bravo again, Dyson!
- Though it took some time to get used to the truck/trailer attitude of a non-upright, having the "remote" brush head/wand was a pleasure getting used to.  Much easier to get around/under things than an upright, IMHO.
- Emptying.  Of course it's dirty when you empty it.  It's called dirt, which is... dirty!  Emptying is no different than the other bagless unit I've previously owned.  To minimize getting black lung, empty it outdoors, don't dump it on yourself, don't stand down-wind, and all is well!  Small price to pay to not fuss with bags.
- Love how the separate power head allows you to get in lots of places an upright simply can't reach.  Did I already mention this?
- Extend-able wand.  It's sturdy-gauge extruded aluminum and thus really, really built to last, which I think is why it's been reported a bit difficult to fully extend.  Give it time, folks!  I bet it will "wear in" and get easier with use.  Again, small price to pay for what you get, namely serious durability!
Cons:
- The fact that the wand attachments must connect to the rigid, bulky section of condensed wand does limit the "flexibility" of the assembly, but on the other hand, you can reach cobwebs, miniblinds, ceiling fans and other such out-of-reach places, which would be difficult or impossible to do otherwise.  Having either option would have been ideal (removable wand), but that would in turn create another path for air leaks and another electrical connection for the powered beater brush.  Dyson made a judgement call and naturally it wasn't going to please everyone.
- Short cord.  What's another 10 feet of cord going to hurt?  If it's a voltage drop issue, maybe there's something to be said for that, as vac cords already do get quite warm from electrical resistance, and if you notice, the DC21 cord is relatively thin.  Going a full larger wire gauge size to make the cord longer would likely add some serious bulk to a unit many already consider on the heavy side.  Going longer with the thin cord may have the potential to start a fire or not deliver proper (and necessary) voltage to the unit under load.  As I see it, no big deal, it's not supposed to be a central vac installation.  Get an extension cord if it really bothers you, and as others have done.  The instructions explicitly state that extension cords are not to be used, but again, they're doing business in the 21st century, and thus are also in the business of not getting sued... so if you use an extension cord and start a fire or melt your vac motor, you were warned, and if you're reading this, you were warned twice!
- Hose soft and prone to collapsing.  I really don't know about this one.  C'mon Dyson, this really gets on my nerves, though it only happened once thus far, but I don't think it should happen at all.  Maybe I just need a bit more "can vac" practice?!
All in all, it gets 4 stars.  It does the job it is intended to do, clean the snot (dust and dirt, really) out of stuff, does this task EXCEEDINGLY well, and as many have attested, on a level not readily matched by other models.  But really not a good excuse I can think of for the shoddy hose quality, and though I'm not nearly as informed as Dyson on the subject, had I been working as his engineer, I would have pushed to have the extendable wand detachable for flexibility of using hand tools.  Also, it's an expensive unit for most people, but believe me, a lot of associated R&D and risk has paid a dear price for such a great design, and the results speak for themselves.  Worth every penny, even at full price.
All in all, do yourself a favor, get a Dyson!  And especially if you're able to find a great deal like I did...

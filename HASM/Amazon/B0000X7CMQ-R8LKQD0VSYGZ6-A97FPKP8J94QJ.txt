Title: Finally, A great coffeemaker!!!
Content:
I have gone through so many coffee makers and money looking for that one coffee maker that makes good hot coffee and doesn't break down on you after a couple of months. My last Cuisinart Coffee maker that I spent twice the amount of money on broke down 4 times within 3 years. Although the customer service was good, it is pain to have to pack & send the coffee maker back each time and wait for them to fix it or replace it. And with spending that kind of money for all the bells and whistles, the Cuisinart coffee maker did not make a good cup of coffee. So, I took a chance after seeing all the great reviews and bought this coffee maker that I can't even begin to pronounce the name of. When I first received it and pulled it out of the box, my first thought was that I made a big mistake because it felt kind of cheap. It is very basic and light weight. But now after four months of use I can tell you that it is the best coffee maker I have ever owned. It is easy to use, easy to program, makes your coffee super fast and the most important feature is that it makes a great cup of hot coffee. My only complaint would be that I wish it was bigger and made more coffee. Note: I did contact the manufacturer via their web site and you can order an extra coffee pot (carafe) directly from them so you may make another pot of coffee right away if you like. One warning; don't ever screw the top on too tight before making your coffee because it could be REALLY difficult to unscrew once you have made coffee in it.

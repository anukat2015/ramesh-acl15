Title: Amazing little vacuum
Content:
We bought this vacuum to replace an old mighty mite that had lasted years and years.  I was amazed at the strength in this new model- it picked up dirt and pet hair that I thought was permanently embedded in the carpet!  Also the pet hair attachment is fantastic for the couch and the drapes.  My only complaint is that it is hard to adjust the suction with the little air vent at the neck of the vacuum, though once you figure it out it works well.  I also love that it has a HEPA filter and comes with two vacuum bags.

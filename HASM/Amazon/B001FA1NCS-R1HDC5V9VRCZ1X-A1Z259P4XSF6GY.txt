Title: A disappointment
Content:
What a disppointment.  I received this 4th Generation iPod as a Christmas gift.  I was really looking forward to getting it as my previous iPod nano was full and I needed one with more room.  It works great and looks great(the new bigger screen is very nice), but Apple changed the charging plugin so that these new ones are not charged on my iHome or any of the other accesories that we have.  This becomes a big pain, especially when traveling.  I used to be able to charge my ipod while I was driving and listening, now the iPods must be plugged into the computer or into an outlet using an adapter to be charged.  It is very inconveniant.

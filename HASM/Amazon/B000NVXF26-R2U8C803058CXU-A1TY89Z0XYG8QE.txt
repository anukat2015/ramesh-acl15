Excellent camera in every way.  I have taken approximatly 6oo pictures during the past three weeks and love the way it handles.  The live view is especially useful in my studio taking portrates and for macro shots. I couldn't be more thrilled with the speed of focus and shutter lag.  I already own the E-300,the E-500 and the 550UZ.  I will buy the E-3 also as soon as I can find a reason to have the very best in my photo arsenal

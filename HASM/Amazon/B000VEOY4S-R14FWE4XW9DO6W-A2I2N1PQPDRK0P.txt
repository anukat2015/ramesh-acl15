Title: Great for Hardwood Floors - Bad for Carpets and Rugs
Content:
This vacuum (B&D) is lightweight and great for hardwood floors (and for use by the elderly as it is lightweight). It is great for fragile furniture as the all-plastic design will not bang up walls or furniture legs when inadvertantly hit.
Useless for carpets and rugs... For carpets and rugs, I ended up buying a a Hoover equivalent at Walmart for slightly less.... the electric powered attachment is good for carpets and rugs... more heavyweight, chromed-metal design, however too heavy-duty for hardwood floors or around fine furniture... heavy and bangs things up too much.
So now I own 2 vacuums, one for each task.

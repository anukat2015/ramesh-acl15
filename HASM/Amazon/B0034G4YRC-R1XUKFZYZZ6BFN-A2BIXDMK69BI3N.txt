Title: Good laptop for the price
Content:
This is a good laptop not a great one.   The 3:50 battery life is overrated.  I get on average 2hours with LED's off and display dimmed to the max.  This is with WIFI on.
The display is a very crisp and bright one but I would not recommend for a multimedia laptop as viewing angle is limited.
All that said the laptop is very powerful.  It will play any of my game with ease.  i like the keyboard and pad.

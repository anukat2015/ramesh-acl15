Title: Poor quality, doesn't last
Content:
We purchased this product and loved it, while it worked.  Somewhere between 6-12 months, it just quit working.  (The outlet juggling worked a couple times, but now it is just dead).  It really disappoints me a lot.  Cuisinart is supposed to be synonymous with quality, guess that isn't true any more.  This coffee maker is way too expensive to quit working so soon.
I'll be going back to the less expensive brands, and don't mind replacing a $20 unit every couple years...

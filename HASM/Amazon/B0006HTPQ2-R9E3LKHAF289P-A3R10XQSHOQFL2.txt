Title: WOW, what a lemon!
Content:
It's amazing how one product can totally turn away a die-hard Apple fan, and this is the product. Before this, I had been a loyal Apple buyer since 1998, but no more. The first one I got had battery problems from the get-go, so I had it exchanged after about 6 weeks. After about 5 months, the exchanged unit started having the same problem. I went to request service, but Apple would not support it and insisted on charging me $30 for shipping back to Apple to repair. As this was still under warranty, I balked at the idea for having to pay to ship back an obviously defective product, so I requested a return/refund. No one at Apple or Mac Mall, whom I had purchased the unit from, would assist me, shuffling me back and forth without resolution. Today I finally got my fill and challenged the purchase w/my credit card company (American Express). I'm getting my money back, and I'll never buy anything from Apple again!

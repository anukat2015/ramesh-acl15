Title: What more could an amateur want?
Content:
When I was researching cameras and lenses, I was concerned with all the recommendations of the 5D over the XTi for amateur use, including that of "Consumer Reports".  I made the choice for the XTi and I haven't been the least bit sorry.  Unless you are a pro and can justify almost double the price, this camera works and works well.  I chose to put my money into a better lens, in my case a Tamron 17-50mm, f2.8.
Personally, because of my investment in lenses for my Canon EOS film camera, I was driven to chose a Canon digital.  If you don't have that as an issue, you may want to consider competitive units, but for my money, I am fully happy with my decision to purchase the XTi.

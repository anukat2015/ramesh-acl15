Title: PURCHASE WITH CAUTION!
Content:
I wish I would have done a more comprehensive search of user feedback on the web rather than the professional reviews of this computer.  Sure it's a good bargain, it seems fast and works ok but the piece that I missed was the overwhelming number of users who reported sticking keys.  Guess what 18 days of using my computer keys began to not work.  I was so upset, called Dell and they wanted me to replace the parts.  They were happy to "walk me through" the process.....WHAT?! I have an 18 day old non working computer and Dell wants me to do the repairs???  I balked and then they agreed that since it was within 30 days they would send a tech out.  Oh, the techs don't work evenings or weekends, and I don't have a flexible schedule.....so we set up an appointment at lunch, and the tech doesn't show, only to call me to tell me he is on his way at the point I have to be back at work.
It gets better.  I am livid at this point, what a waste of money.  I froze the charge since it was all so new.  I call back Dell again and tell them that I froze the charge and want to send the computer back.  Turns out I only had 21 days from PURCHACE to send it back.  Doesn't matter I've only had the computer in my possession for 18 days; it was too late since I was over the 21 days.  I could cry.  On a limited budget I get a computer with keys that don't work and service techs that don't show up.  By the way, the last Dell rep threatened to screw my credit up if I didn't pay.....got to love that....
Buyers beware.  It's all so wrong on a number of levels.

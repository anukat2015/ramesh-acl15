Title: BROKEN ALREADY !!   FIRST DAY !!
Content:
This sounded good... my feet are always cold.
It seems very cheap, light plastic.
Idea is good.....  I had no trouble operating the buttons with my feet.
I had it on high for about 10 minutes, then turned it to low.  I had to put on socks because the TOPS of my feet stayed cold.  Low is OK... barely warm... but warm enought I guess.
A few hours later I tried it again, and only cold air comes out from the air and the HIGH HEAT settings.  LOW continues to put out barely warm air.   If I push hard on the left side of the button and hold it there it tries to heat.  If I take my finger away.........   cold air.
So, it seems like the switch is not lined up properly to activate the high heat setting.
I am very disappointed in this.  I will not send it back because it costs too much to package and return it.  I will probably continue to use it on the barely warm setting... Low. 
I am VERY unhappy with this product.  After reading the reviews, I wonder if the older models were better made?

Title: not for me
Content:
My husband picked this up yesterday, and it's driving me batty.  I should point out that I have some slight sensory issues, and this unit brings them out in full force.  The little slots around the main grill blow COLD air!!!  Sitting in front of the machine trying to warm up in our chilly apartment was like being in a nice hot shower when someone opens the bathroom door and lets in a blast of cold air.  My brain couldn't decide if it was trying to warm me up or cool me off.  Then again, I realize this unit was not made to sit in front of, but rather to heat the whole room.  About that--when I first turned the unit on, it displayed my room temperature as 56 deg.  I set the temperature to 85, and over the next few hours, it never reached a room temperature of more than 61 deg!!!

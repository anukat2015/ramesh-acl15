Title: NEVER BUY ANOTHER HP PRODUCT AGAIN!
Content:
Ive had my HP Pavilion dv6000 for only 2 years have taken care of it but it has been giving me constant problems. At first the battery started draining so fast even though it said "completely charged" it would die in 4 to 5 minutes. I had the battery replaced. Next the power cord is of such poor quality that it ripped off from the brick ...i had to get a new one. The other problems i am experiencing now are that the computer fan goes off like crazy, the mouse freezes all the time, programs stops working. I try shutting the computer down and now it wont start windows right away, i have to press the shut off button more than 5 times for it to come back. The wireless adapter suddenly doesnt pick up any signal anymore..i mean its just a FREAKING MESS!!! i have contacted HP and they dont want to repair this problem because supposedly my computer is no longer covered under their "extended warranty plan" for the wireless problem!!!! They wanted to charge me 450 dollars just to replace the newtwork adapter and the motherboard!!! its outrageous! This is their freaking problem---they had a freaking re-call for goodness sakes! My advice to all you guys planning to buy a laptop: DONT BUY AN HP one. They do not respond..very unreliable. 
THEY DONT EVENT DESERVE THE ONE STAR I WAS FORCED TO RATE THEM WITH!

Title: Great replacement for the EOS Rebel Ti film camera
Content:
After much review and after considering my favorable experinece with the Canon PowerShot A590IS, i decided to buy this camera about 2 months ago.  I am totally amazed by it!  First off, all my optics and flash that I used with the film camera work with this camera flawlessly.  The resolution of the pictures and the colors are excellent.  The autofocus is FAST.  What I like the most about it is that is it light weight (like my film camera was) and with the the 2GB memory card I can take 1,600 pictures and not having to change films after every 24th frame.  It is great to be able to see the picture right after I took it.  I beleive I have a good combination on hand: take the wide angle general purpose photos with my PowerShot A590IS and use this camera with my 300 mm optically stabilized telephoto.  Only one negative comment:  the autofocus function in the real image view settings is LAME.  So much so, that I do not even use it.  I can not understand how that same function in the much less expensive PowerShot works so well, yet in this camera it is nearly useless.  My overall rating = 5 out of 5.

Title: Overall a very good mp3 player
Content:
I just bought my ipod nano today and I love it. It's truly an incredible device. Despite the negativness about scratches and the screen flaws, I took my precautions in advance and I'm able to enjoy this great mp3 player. I carry in an elegant silicon case which I bought from ebay at a very reasonable price.
Pros:
Excellent and ergonomic design
Very small size thus very protable
Excellent screen
Functional buttons (the wheel works fine even though I haven't removed the plastic tape and I carry it in a silicone case)
Satisfactory sound quality
Cool extra features
Cons:
The headphones that come with the nano need replacment, the sound quality comes out very poor
No extra accesories in the box, apart from the bad headphones, the useless for most people dock adapter and the USB cable
iTunes is necessary or it won't load
The expensive accesories
It scratches easily 
Overall its a great mp3 player, that you can really enjoy if you have some things in mind:
You should first buy protective case against scratces
You should first buy a good pair of headphones
You should treat the device with care because it's more fragile compared to other versions of ipod

Title: Not quite right for San Diego summer (have no air conditioner).
Content:
Bought this swamp cooler to at least give it a chance to see how it will work in the house this summer.  Before purchasing, I understood that it is better if used in places with LOW humidity, as we average between 60% and 70%, I was still hoping that this machine would still make a difference.  In the hottest part of the day it does bring the felt temperature down a few degrees (so imagine if it's 90F in the house, it will bring it down to about 85F-88F) but you must keep all windows and curtains/shades drawn with one window open.  This will help the cool air molecules move the hot air molecules out.  It seems best if the ice bins are continually topped off with ice, though.  An additional fan helps the cool air move about better.  I do feel an increase in humidity but it is bearable.  After some time of running the water pump, if only the fan is operating, there is a smell coming from the water tank.  A thorough cleaning of the tank and dust filters should solve that problem.  At night it works more effeciently, for obvious reasons.  Overall, this machine works as designed but it must be in an environment that it works best in.  Please check the humidity average in your area as this will add about (my guess) 15% more.

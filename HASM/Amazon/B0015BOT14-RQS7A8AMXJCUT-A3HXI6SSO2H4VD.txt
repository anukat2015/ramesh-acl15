Title: Don't Do It!
Content:
I give this product 2 stars because it couldn't have been easier to upload songs onto it.  Other than that this product has been nothing but trouble.  My daughter (who has been very careful with her precious new MP3 player) has used it a total of 4 times.  It PLOWS through batteries.  And now it no longer works at all.  It won't turn on.   Although I'm still searching for answers, I haven't gotten any from Coby's 800 number.
I hear that Sony makes the best MP3 players, I guess I shouldn't have skimped to get this one.

Title: Okay for the price
Content:
I have used Black & Decker single cup machines for years.  I am not a big coffee drinker, and the machines are inexpensive, so I didn't mind having to replace them often because the start switch breaks regularly.  However, after repeated switch breakage, I've reached my limit and am searching for another brand and a switch that is not the press downward, springloaded type.  I think it must be the internal spring that breaks.  Since this has happened to me for years (10+), I can't imagine that Black & Decker isn't aware of it, so I suppose they don't care.

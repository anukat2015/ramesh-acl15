Title: Like it... careful with shipping
Content:
Ordered a DeLonghi unit and like it. After reading some reviews it seems that some units might get damaged in shipping if poorly pacakged/shipped, causing water to leak - so I bought from a company with a good shipping and return policy. Unit seems to cool very well and I don't have to deal with emptying water which is a huge plus compared to different brand unit I tried.

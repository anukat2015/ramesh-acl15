Title: Overall Good Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
I brought this Vacuum Cleaner since 2009 Summer and still working without any problems. Here are my pro and cons list below.
Pros:
-less dust when taking out with close container.
-works well on hardwood floors.
-automatic cord retraction.
-the filter has longer uses than Dirt Devil 082500.
Cons:
-little heavier than Dirt Devil 082500.
-for carpet areas, not so well. Still use Dirt Devil 082500 brush for carpet areas.
That's about it, pretty good overall product.

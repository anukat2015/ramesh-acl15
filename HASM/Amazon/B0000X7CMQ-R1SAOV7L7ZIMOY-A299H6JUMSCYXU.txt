Title: First thermal for us -- we love it
Content:
This coffee pot keeps coffee piping hot for hours, even without "preheating" the carafe by rinsing with hot water.  We badly needed a thermal because we often drink coffee hours apart.  I've tried the coffee over 12 hours later and it's still hot.  Yes, the lid is badly designed for grasping, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.  But we've found that turning the lid only a quarter turn past "open" works just fine at keeping the coffee hot.  If you close it all the way, you'll have a tough time getting it back open!  Another minor flaw was the lid's almost invisible "dot" but a dab of pink nail polish solved that problem.  I highly recommend this product and am extremely satisfied with it.

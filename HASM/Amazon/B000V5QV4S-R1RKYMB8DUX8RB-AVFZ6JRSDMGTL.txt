Title: 40D - Yes please!
Content:
Pros: Great image quality, easy to use, great UI, reasonably priced (used), very decent high FPS capability, very good battery life, quiet shutter, live view occasionally helpful in real world shooting, nice viewfinder, decent built in flash, very good high ISO performance
Cons: Physically large, 1.6x crop, CF only storage.
Review: After using the Rebel XT (which I still like quite a bit) I decided that I should get a bigger fancier, more expensive camera to take on vacation to Japan.  I had quite a bit of buyers remorse right before I went on my trip, because it took a good $650.00 out of my bank account (purchased Used). BUT as soon as I got to Japan, and I actually just walked around for 2 weeks looking to take pictures, I found that the upgrades in usability vs. the Rebel XT were well worth it.  The superior click-wheel roll-ey wheel interface made getting settings right and in a hurry, easy.  I also like the customizable "my menu" feature, which further simplifies use.  So, it's great.  If I could change anything, I would make it take SDHC cards/ weather seal the whole body, and that's about it.  From what I understand 12MP is about as many as you want on a 1.6x crop sensor.  I feel no envy toward the 50D.  But, the 5D MkII does look fabulous to me... 
100% recommended, Perhaps the best 1.6x crop body camera evar!

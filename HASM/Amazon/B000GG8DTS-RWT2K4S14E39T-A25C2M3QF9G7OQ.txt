Title: Handy product, but don't expect desert-like heat
Content:
This is a pretty good heater for specialized uses. I'm using it in a small bathroom and it works great - kicks off more than enough heat, compact in size, and easy to use. Most importantly, it's economical to run. Since it only draws 300 watts, it uses a fraction of the electricity of a larger (1,500 watt) heater.
I can also see this as being a very effective personal heater for an office - it makes zero noise (no fan), so it won't disturb the person in the next cubical.
But, its economical nature means that this is not a good choice if you're looking to heat anything other than a very small room or use it for spot heating. 
It comes with a three year warranty but there's a catch - you need to mail it back with a check for either $15 or $20 (depending on how long you've had it) to get a replacement. Once you figure in the cost of return postage, it costs more to repair it than buy a new one. Build quality is what you would expect at this price point - nothing great, but decent. 
Good choice for specialized uses, and very economical in terms of energy usage.

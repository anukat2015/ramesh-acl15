Title: Nice bargain & very user-friendly!
Content:
I literally spent more time compiling my playlist on Windows MediaPlayer than I did getting this SanDisk Player up and running with my songs.  It is very user friendly and extremely light.  The headphones are a bit big for my ears, but that's easily remedied.  I agree with a previous reviewer regarding the akwardness of the search button.  I only gave this product four stars so far because I haven't yet seen how durable the player will be with the dust in the horse barn.  But thus far, I have to admit I'm impressed.  The price is unbeatable for the amount of space you have available compared to iPods and other players on the market right now.

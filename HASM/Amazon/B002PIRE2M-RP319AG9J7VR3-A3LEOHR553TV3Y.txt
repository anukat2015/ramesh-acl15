Title: Fantastic Notebook
Content:
Bought this for my wife.  Paid $399 plus a few dollars for shipping.  The setup and data transfer from my old notebook was painless and almost automatic.  My friend has an Atom based netbook and there is no comparison.  The Acer is fast, lightweight has a great screen and wonderful battery life.  Only issue I had was that the microphone didn't work but I was offered a replacement unit.  After several days getting it setup exactly the way I wanted it, I was not willing to replace it.  I purchased a small external mike for $10 and all is well now for video chats with my family and friends.  When I am ready for a new laptop, I plan to purchase this unit for myself.

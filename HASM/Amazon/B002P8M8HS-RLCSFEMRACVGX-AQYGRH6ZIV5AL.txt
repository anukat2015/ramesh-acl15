Title: Great, except sound.
Content:
I have owned, and still do, numerous PCs from various manufacturers. It has been years since I owned a Toshiba. I have been using this one for about four weeks now, and for the money I rate it very highly. Overall, however, I gave it only three stars, but in essence I have two separate reviews for this machine: 1) The PC without regard to the internal speaker system -- 4.5 stars -- mostly excellent in all regards, 2) the internal speaker system -- 1 star for horrible. Here I am not making reference to the occasionally noted problem with Toshiba internal PC speakers to just stop working. Mine worked right out of the box, and still do. They just work very poorly -- both underpowered and with low sound quality. If you use external speakers or headphones this is not a problem, but if you plan on enjoying sounds directly from the PC speakers, and if that is important to you, I would be hesitant about buying this otherwise very fine machine.

Title: Good Camera, but really no better than the 40D
Content:
I purchased a 50D because I do a fair amount of bird photography, and I thought that the additional pixel count in this camera would yield better images, and also allow for more cropping room. While the images were very good, they really weren't any better than those I have taken with my 40D. I was also disappointed with the high ISO performance of the 50D, as I thought the 40D was just as good or better.
Even so, the 50D is still a very good camera. If you are upgrading from a 10, 20, or 30D, you will notice substantial improvement in features and better image quality. If you have a 40D, I think it becomes tougher to justify the upgrade. In the end, I decided to return my 50D and take advantage of Amazon's excellent return policy.

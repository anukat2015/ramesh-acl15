Title: Very disappointing
Content:
I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 because it still worked a tad better than my absolutely pathetic Dirt Devil. However, it was so far from what I expected that it's not even funny. I saw it rated relatively high on several sites and I am still trying to figure out what kind of conspiracy there is behind those ratings. Had it been some American brand, I would have attributed the extremely non-objective opinions to patriotism. But it is made in Sweden - which I thought was a good sign - yet it is a bad product. Save yourself the grief and buy the German made Miele. It looks like the Germans are the only ones left on this Earth who have the decency to abstain from ripping people off by selling garbage.

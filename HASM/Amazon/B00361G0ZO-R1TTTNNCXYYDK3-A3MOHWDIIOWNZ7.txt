Title: LAPTOP W/O BACKPACK & MOUSE
Content:
It does seem ridiculous at times how orders can become troublesome, ASUS laptops appear to be in this category.   Two bad ASUS, the N10JH-A1 blue screened repeatedly trying to get to desktop and constantly when trying to use HDMI which ASUS could fix and returned to Amazon, bag made it and mouse didn't. .  The N61JQ-X1 blue screened during initial setup, blue screened twice during internet streamed movies.  Mouse missing.  Advertised with premium amplified sound, added cone speakers etc. by Amazon and Asus- hardware features which didn't exist.
This unit, an Asus G51Jx-X3 was purchased more for specs and graphics ability than gaming which we don't do (PS3 for grandkids).  Amazon ad has the Republic of Gamers Laptop backpack and the Razor optical mouse, as does Asus ad, and about every UTube or review seen.   Our unit received today, NO BACKPACK OR MOUSE.  HAVE EMAILED AMAZON, AMAZON CORPORATE AND CALLED COMPUTER SALES.  WILL REPORT AND UPDATE REVIEW WHEN AMAZON'S RESPONSE TO THESE DEFICIENCIES IS FINAL.   
QUESTION: Is there anyone else who has noticed the circular grill (2-1/2-3") on bottom of laptop for bottom fired subwoofer touted in many reviews for all Asus G 51 units is MISSING?  Would love to hear who has or who hasn't.  Unfortunately this was one of deciding factors for BETTER sound that we were looking for when it wasn't in the N61Jq (look at Asus website, products, laptops, gaming laptops, then click N61, then N61Jq, look at description and watch video to see what we are  talking about)  Amazon is changing their ads after our complaint on this issue.

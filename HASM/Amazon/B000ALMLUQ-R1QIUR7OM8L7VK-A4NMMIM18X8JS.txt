Title: Great product
Content:
The Flavia Fusion is a great product. I have also used one of their office machines where it was a huge hit. 
Been using Senseo at home but will now switch when I finish off my last Senseo pods.
If you like your coffee strong, be careful.
When you turn the water level up, it's adjustable, the coffee can get a little weak unless you use one of their stronger types of coffee filterpacks. Look for 5+ strength rating on the coffee. There is a new one called "Intense Dark Roast" that they rate as 7. 
There are a couple online retailers I have found for the filterpacks. There is also Flavia's own website. The sweetspot is to buy the "cases" of 100 filterpacks. That's where the best value is.
If you bought the Fusion at Macy's don't continue to buy the filterpacks from them. Even their sale price is higher than the other stores regular prices. Their regular "not on sale" price is double Flavia's own website. Plus you can't be guaranteed you won't get coffee past the expiration date as I can say from experience.

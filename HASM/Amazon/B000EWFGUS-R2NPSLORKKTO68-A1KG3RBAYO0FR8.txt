Title: I love this coffee pot!!!
Content:
We have owned several high end coffee pots and used European drip pots. When I got this inexpensive pot I thought I wouldn't lose much if it turned out to be a dud. However quite the contrary, it is easier to use and makes coffee fast and good, so we are really happy. Hope it lasts. Our last two high end makers stopped heating the water to the right degree.

Title: Works great! When it actually is working...
Content:
I have two long-haired cats and was in need of a vacuum, so the Pet Hair Eraser seemed perfect. I loved this vacuum at first. It was sooo powerful that it felt self-propelled. The canister filled up in no time. Even the attachments worked well. But then it started...
About four months after I bought it, it started making a horribly loud noise. This was followed by smoke and a broken belt. I replaced the belt, and the belt once again broke. I took the vacuum apart and examined the brush, and saw the problem- the brush had become off-centered in its holder, causing it to jam. The plastic ends were warped into more of an oval than a circle, thus the problem. I ordered a new brush, and once again had a great vacuum. Until it happened again, about a month after replacing it the first time. This wouldn't have been as big of an issue had I not misplaced the receipt and therefore couldn't get anything covered under the warranty. I called the vacuum store in town, and the first thing the guy said when I told him which vacuum I had was "Oh, I'm sorry." Apparently I'm not the only one with issues. 
Long story short, I finally gave this away. I suppose I could have kept replacing the brush, but it only makes sense to do that so many times. I ended up buying what appears to be the same vacuum minus the pet attachments (which I kept from my old one anyway) at Costco, mainly for their return policy, should this happen again. 
Summary- This vacuum is fantastic when it works, but breaking twice in five months is too often.

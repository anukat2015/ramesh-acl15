Title: This was not a good choice for me
Content:
I've owned this coffeemaker for about a year now, and I regret the purchase.
This machine is well-built, and the controls are easy to use. It's easy to program, and the programming is quite versatile. It makes pretty good coffee.
I have used thermal carafe coffeemakers for many years. They keep the coffee fairly hot, but more importantly, they keep the coffee tasting freshly-brewed for many hours. The coffee flavor from the Cuisinart DCC-2000 suffers after sitting in the machine after an hour or so. I like to have fresh coffee available throughout the day, so I often end up filling a thermos right after the coffee finishes brewing. If I let the coffee sit in the Cuisinart too long, it seems to pick up a plastic flavor from its bucket. The flavor of the freshly-brewed coffee is pretty good, but I have to say it doesn't compare well to the flavor from my glitchy old Black & Decker thermal carafe machine.
The biggest problem I'm having with the Cuisinart is cleaning the coffee bucket completely. I rinse the coffee bucket thoroughly after each use, and chunks of coffee float to the surface.  This is not from the bottom of the bucket; this coffee scrunge is coming from the chamber that houses the coffee-level gauge, which is enclosed within the side wall of the coffee bucket. It is not accessible for cleaning. The coffee gauge idea is nice, but it is so not worth the trouble of trying to keep it clean.
I'll be going back to a thermal carafe machine.

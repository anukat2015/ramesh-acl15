Title: very very good
Content:
well, I am throughly pleased with the Zune 4gig (2nd gen). from size, to feel, fm radio, and the zune market place. I haven purchased any music and dont plan on to as I rather listen to pod casts. love how I can customize it to dl a certain amount of podcasts and then it just syncs with the player. 
I have watched some vids and well, it does a splendid job as well in that category. 
next for me might be the 80gig, 4gigs just isnt going to cut it for vac's.

Title: Heat
Content:
My daughter's college apt. is cold to say the least. She lives in a house that was built in the turn of the century and since everything is original, it's drafty and cold. We bought her this heater to be able to heat her room where the wall furnace doesn't reach and it's wonderful! We went to see her and brought it into the living room where we all were and you could tell the difference. I highly recommend this, especially for college kids as it has safety features built in. We would definitely buy this again!

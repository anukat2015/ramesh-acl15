Title: A great digital SLR
Content:
This is my first digital SLR and I'm glad I made this camera the first. It's easy to use and fun to learn all the features. The quality of photos are far superior to my previous point-and-shoot 2mp camera. Now that I have this camera, I'm taking a lot more photos and really satisfied with the results. The price is not too high that a first-time buyer is intimidated and not too low that you feel its a cheap starter. The kit lens (18 - 55mm) is okay for basic use but I'm already exploring to purchase a better lens. Overall, the Canon XTI is a great camera especially for digital SLR rookies.

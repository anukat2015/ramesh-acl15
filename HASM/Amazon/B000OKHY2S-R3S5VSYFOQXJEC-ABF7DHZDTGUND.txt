Title: It works,,,  thats it.
Content:
This cooler has not met my expectations.  I don't think my expectations are too high.  The cooler does have a decent blower and it does function properly.  It just doesn't really cool a room.  I did follow the directions and inserted the ice/water.  While generating some moisture in the room, it pretty much stopped there.  For me, its a very expensive fan.

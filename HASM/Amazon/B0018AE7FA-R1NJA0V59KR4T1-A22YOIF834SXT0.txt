Title: Great coffee maker!
Content:
Just purchased this coffee maker and is perfect.  Not too small or too big.  To the other posts claiming that it makes so little coffee, I call BS.  I use a bigger than average coffee mug and I get 3 full mugs of coffee, which is ideal for me.  It is a little on the cheap side (what isn't now a days), but still a good coffee maker overall.

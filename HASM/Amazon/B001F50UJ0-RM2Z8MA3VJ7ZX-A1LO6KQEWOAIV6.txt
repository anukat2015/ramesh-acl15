Title: FIRST TIME MP3 PLAYER OWNER
Content:
Okay so I wanted an MP3 player and I look at reviews for RCA, SYLVANIA, SANDISK and a lot of cheaper brands but I decided to go with the namebrand Sony. I just purchased the 8 GB today and all I can say is wooooooooooooooow!! I am NOT technology savvy and burning songs to the MP3 player from windows media was a breeze!! The sound quality is great!!! It has BASS...REAL bass!!! AND it has an FM Tuner that works perfect!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it and I'm glad I spend a little more money on a quality product!! Ipod who??

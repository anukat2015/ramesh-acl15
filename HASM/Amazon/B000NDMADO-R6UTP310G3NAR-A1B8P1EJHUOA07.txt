Title: DC 21 is ok, DC 18 is so much better than this!
Content:
My inlaws just purchased this item, replacing their old DC7. I asked to use it because I wanted to compare my recent purchase of the DC18. First I hate the small retractable cord. I was just going to say how I liked the feature about the retractable cord better than the non retractable one I had, but then I pulled it out and it only came to half the distance that I would expect from normal retractable vacuums (BIG -). I then extended the arm of this vacuum so that it could lock in place and I just kept thinking why does this have to be fully extended, how easy would it be to have a feature to allow you to extend to various heights? I went and grabbed the heavy main attachment and started vacuuming. I felt a little uneasy vacuuming not really sure whether to hold the canister in one arm while vacuuming or letting it down and vacuum by pulling this little ball of a vacuum with this enormous handle and attachment, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and started with it down on the floor but it kept getting in the way and not following me like others have said. I kept thinking "why would you buy a vacuum that makes life harder and not easier for you? I then picked the vacuum up and finished off by vacuuming with one hand on the handle and one holding the canister. I really dislike this vac. I recommend the vacuum DC18; this was made with some thought process and is only lacking a (long) retractable cord not a whole design problem like this one.

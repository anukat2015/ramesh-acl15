Title: Top notch
Content:
I replaced my Rebel XT with this beauty, well worth every penny. This camera is built like a tank, has plenty more features than my XT and pictures look way better , I was expecting almost no change in IQ however I have to say I am pretty impressed as they look indeed better.
Update 12/26/2009:
Still in love with my camera. Have seen 50D, 7D, but still have no desire to upgrade, maybe in a year or 2 and just for the benefit of having higer ISO and the novelty of video in the newer cameras (which could prove handy as I dont own a viedeo camera).

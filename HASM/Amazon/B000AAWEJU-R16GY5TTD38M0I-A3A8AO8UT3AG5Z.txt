Title: Finally someone has made a vacuum that works well!
Content:
I must admit that I am a thorough researcher when it comes to household investments. When looking for a new vacuum cleaner, I literally spent days poring over reviews. What did I find? Most people HATE their vacuums, and some people find theirs to be OK. A depressing conclusion...
Then, I came across this Miele. Being fresh out of school, I was reluctant to spend this much money on a vacuum. 
So, instead, I went across the street to a large department store and bought a popular brand model. It only took one vacuuming session to compare the two and run back to buy the Miele. It doesn't have many fancy features, but the Miele does it's basic job really, really well. 
Another big factor for me was long-term satisfaction of other customers. Almost every review I have come across follows the pattern of "It was great while it worked, for the first 12 months..." As someone who is trying to live a relatively environmentally friendly life, this stand in contrast to everything I stand for. I was looking to buy a vacuum cleaner that would last me decades. 
While I haven't owned this model long enough to be able to judge it on its long-term durability, Miele products in general score high marks in this category, and they contain a number of easily replaceable parts inside. 
I hope that this is the last vacuum I ever bought!

Title: bring back the 3G shape
Content:
the 4th gen nano makes the mistake of using a curved glass screen, much like that of an old CRT TV. Flat screens = less glare. 
In my opinion, if apple had stuck with the 3rd gen design and introduced all the new colors & new 16GB size with the price drop this would've been perfect. Call me crazy, but I wish this also had an FM tuner as well. A nice product, sure, but still not perfected. 
I wonder how far away the 32GB size is?

Title: if you have non-carpeted floors not a good choice
Content:
I unfortunately overlooked the fact that you cannot turn off the brush on this model. The problem with this is if you have non-carpeted floors half of the dirt is flung all over the place. I just felt like I was sandblasting my legs. Also, if you are using the hose and attachment on steps or whatever and the vacuum tilts at all (which it will) it could damage your floor because the brush is still going full force. It is powerful, but unless your entire house has wall to wall carpeting it is a poor choice. Buy a model where you can turn the brush off!

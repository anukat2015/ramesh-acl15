Title: Best little heater ever !
Content:
Absolutly love this heater, I bought it because I needed to keep the downstairs of my loft apt. warm. I have central air and heat in my apt. but to keep the upper part at the right temp. the downstairs was always chilly. This heater works great, with the adjustable themostat I could set it were now the living/dining area stays warm. Since I take care of my grandson at nights I no longer worry about it being too cold for him. In fact it has done such a good job that I rarely have to turn on the central heat. Since heat rises as it warms the downstairs it also is keeping the upper loft area at a comfortable temp..

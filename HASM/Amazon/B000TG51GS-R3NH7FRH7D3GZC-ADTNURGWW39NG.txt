Title: a very decent heater
Content:
This is a very decent header.  The housing is big relative to the heating element.  I got this unit at a very good price because it was featured in a Friday sale.  The only complaint is the control; it is not intuitive or it is unnecessarily complicated.  Normally, one would not need to consult the manual to understand the control for a simple heater.

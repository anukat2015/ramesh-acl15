Title: fooled by advertising
Content:
At my age I should know better. We purchased two from the manufacturer. Now halfway through the second winter one has stopped working. We have had mild winters lately so they were not used much.  The other is still working and does keep a small room warm if you always keep all doors closed (hard to do unless you are bedridden). It does seem to be safe as they said, this is good because it has to run constantly  to maintain a reasonable temp.  Hard to tell if it does use 50% less energy since we have to run it all the time. Definitely think that this product is not worth the price.

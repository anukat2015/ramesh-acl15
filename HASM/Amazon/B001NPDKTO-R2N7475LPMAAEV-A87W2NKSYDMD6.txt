Title: Very nicely done!
Content:
I purchased the HDX 1140-US for my son. This machine is beautifully constructed, and functions incredibly well. I don't think you can find this much bang for the buck, including dedicated video memory, in another unit in this price range. I think HP hardware has really improved over the years - not so thrilled with their peripheral drivers, though. 
My only complaint - probably not really HP's fault, but they are contributing to the propagation - is the inclusion of Vista. There are much more competent OSes available, but as long as Microsoft has the vendors in their pocket, I guess we will be stuck with it. Although Ubuntu and others are available, some drivers can be difficult to find. 
Please convince me that there is a functional reason why Vista cannot be backwards compatible? Why should we have to keep the old laptop around to run XP-compatible software?
Shop for a good price and rebates and you'll enjoy this laptop - just don't recycle that XP machine quite yet.

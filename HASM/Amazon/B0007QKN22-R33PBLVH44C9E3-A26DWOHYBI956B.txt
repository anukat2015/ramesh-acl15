Title: Excellent Choice
Content:
I bought this camera for my wife recently. It is a great choice for an aspiring photographer, like her, who has a good eye and a desire to learn more advanced photographic concepts. The fully automatic mode makes this camera the best point and shoot out there, in my opinion. You'll be taking great pics a few minutes after you open the box. Other modes give you aperture priority or shutter speed priority as well as full manual. The pics look fantastic! The camera is fairly user friendly and is packed with cool features. The battery's charge seems to last forever. So far we took over 300 photos, many using the onboard flash, and still haven't recharged it! I didn't give it 5 stars because it doesn't come with a compact flash card. You'll need to purchase that separately. 
I recommend this camera to any photographer, on any level, interested in a great digital camera. All this comes at a pretty decent price too.

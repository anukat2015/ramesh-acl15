Title: Disappointed
Content:
I wanted to make one fresh cup of coffee in the mornings before work. I have been heating up coffee from a full pot I make about twice a week.  I thought this would be the answer to a good cup of coffee in the morning but, I am sorry; I do not like the coffee.  I red all of the reviews and thought I made an informed decision when I bought it.  The coffee is week and does not fill a "Coffee Mug".  I like French roast and did buy the French roast pods and tried two different brands.  I think if I used 3 pods for one serving, it might be ok, but is that cost effective?  Plus it takes 1 and ½ to 2 servings to fill a "Coffee Mug".  And then the unit is as big as or bigger than a normal coffee pot.  Wow, all this for one simple cup of coffee.  I went out and bought a small one cup coffee maker with an insulated cup at Big Lots for 9.99 that includes a permanent filter.  I used a non-brand French roast from the grocery store and am very happy.  Plus it is smaller!

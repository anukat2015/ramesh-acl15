Title: Second time around...
Content:
This is the second DTC-975 I've owned.  The first one only lasted 2 years, but I purchased it as a refurbished unit.  I had enjoyed the coffee I brewed in that one, so I thougth I'd get another one...this time new.  I would have to say this one is not as good as the first.  The coffee brewed is not as hot and seems slightly weaker...acceptable, but not as good as the unit manufactured 2+ years ago.  A small problem I have had with both is the feature that lets you take coffee before the brewing cycle is complete...it continues to drip.  So all in all, I say it's an OK product, but not great.

Title: Time will tell
Content:
After much research we purchased the Sebo K3.  We  have had a Hoover and Kenmore canister vacuum previously - and are committed to this style of vacuum.  However we've been disappointed at the durability of our most recent vacuum.  We tried out the different makes and models in many vacuum stores, and settled on this one.  It had a sturdiness and no-nonsense feel about it - and from our research, we trust that it will serve for years.  But, as with anything you buy - time will tell.
The components are handy - attached to the unit.  The releases are basic and my children have figured them out.  The brush-roller can be removed easily to clean the hair and strings that get wrapped around it.  Height is easily adjusted on the wand, and the handle swivels fully both to the right and left (no lefty- adjustments needed).  The "airbelt" we interpret to mean the fabric covered foam strip that encircles the vacuum - which will not scratch furnishings as it bumps up against them.  It vacuums well -- we've only owned it one month -- be happy to update this review as years go by.

Title: I love my DYSON DC 21 Stowaway Vacuum.
Content:
This vacuum has great suction.  This is not the first DYSON I bought I also bought the DC 07 but I love my DC 21 much better.  The DC 21 got in the tightest corners which I could not reach before using my upright vacuum.  The only thing I would recommend Mr. Dyson should do is have a good instruction book.  None came with the vacuum except for a start up guide which wasn't much help.  Other than that the vacuum is the best canister that I've used.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 10.

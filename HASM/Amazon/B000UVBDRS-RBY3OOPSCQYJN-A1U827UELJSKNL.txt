Title: Zen 2 GB
Content:
Creative made a Media player with lots of potential, BUT.
It locks up to easy :o( and it is overly complicated to load media into, and finding the media to play back is a bit hard to start :o(
The play back quality is good with a good volume. You don't have to crank it to the top setting to hear it.
The video looks like it may be good, but none of my AVI's play back on it.
JPG's photos look good on it.
I put and eight gigabyte SD expansion card in it and it holds a few days of music, that's cool. It also has a nice way to index through the listings of music, that's nice...
Over all it's nice, but it could have better software to load, select, and playback media...

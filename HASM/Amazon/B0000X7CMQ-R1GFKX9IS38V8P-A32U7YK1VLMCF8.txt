Title: Would not recommend
Content:
We bought this coffee maker because it got a good review in Consumer Reports.  While it brews fine and fast, we are not happy with 2 things.  First the unit is a bit cocked and the outlet from the filter assembly doesn't line up correctly with the hole in the carafe receiver - it flows into the carafe ok but I think it takes some of the heat out of the brew.  Also I think the carafe itself is infereior to the Krupp that we had previously - this one has a steel liner and doesn't keep the coffee warm - the second cup in the morning has to be nuked to warm it up.

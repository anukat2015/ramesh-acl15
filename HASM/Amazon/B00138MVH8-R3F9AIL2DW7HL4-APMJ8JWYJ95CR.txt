Title: Great Step Up from the Minolta 5D
Content:
I bought the alpha 350 to replace my Minolta 5D, and have been very happy with the features.  The LCD live view is particularly helpful in capturing candid shots, but the image lags behind the position of the actual subject, sometimes causing you to miss the photo you want.  I've found it most useful to frame the subject on the screen, but look at the subject live while depressing the shutter release.

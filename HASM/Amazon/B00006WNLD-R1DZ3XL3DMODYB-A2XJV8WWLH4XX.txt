Title: PURCHASE THIS ITEM, YOU WON'T BE SORRY
Content:
This is the perfect little coffee maker.  My coffee never tasted so good.  I would definitely advise purchasing #1 cone coffee filters for it though.  I set my coffee up the night before and my husband, 30 minutes before going out the door for work pushes the ONE-PUSH button so that my coffee will be ready.  If you don't have this option or you like your coffee really hot and you don't have a husband willing to do this, the coffee maker is very fast and makes excellent coffee.  I have no disappointments whatsoever, just wish it had a timer, but then, I have my husband :)  I consider this an excellent product, have no complaints and, in fact, would purchase it for a single friend.

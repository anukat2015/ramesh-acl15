Title: The Best Available!
Content:
This is the third one of these I've purchased.  The first one lasted about 5 years (which is far longer than any other brand I've owned) and I purchased a second one, which I'm using now.  I then located this one on Amazon at a great price and purchased as a backup to the current one.  I have nothing but good to say about these coffeemakers.  They make a great cup of coffee using either whole beans or previously-ground.  True, it takes a little longer for cleaning (about 5 minutes a day), but this doesn't present a huge problem to me.  The only caveats I offer are to make sure the door containing the brew basket is properly closed (if not, it can come open while brewing and create a mess), and don't try to pour too rapidly from the pot. 
The Amazon price, as usual, is the lowest I could find, and with free shipping it still arrived within a week. 
I'm a coffee connoisseur and I won't use any other unit.

Title: Useless for exercising
Content:
I am about to return my second new iPod shuffle. I wasn't fond of the new design with controls on the headphones because I like to use 3rd party headphone (like those that sit on the ear and not in it), but as it turned out that was the least of my concerns. Sweat just a little bit and the thing starts to go haywire -- sometimes I cannot change the volume at all, or the voice over randomly pops on to tell me the song or the playlist, or sometimes it just stops working altogether. The first time I thought I had a lemon and returned it. But my second one has the same problem.
From reviews I've read on Apple's official Support page, *lots* of people are having the same problem. I guess that controller in the headphones cannot handle any moisture.
I just paid a lot more money for an older shuffle that has only half the memory. Sometimes Apple screws up, and this is one of those times.
If you plan to use your iPod for exercise, do *not* buy this model until Apple fixes the problem.

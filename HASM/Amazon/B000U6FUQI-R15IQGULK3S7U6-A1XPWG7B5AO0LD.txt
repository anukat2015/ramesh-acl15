Title: Pregnant Pet Owner in Love with her Kruz
Content:
I have all hardwood floors and 2 long-hair cats (which I admittedly do not brush enough to keep the hair under control).  The cat hair throughout the home is a constant problem.  Sweeping it up is almost impossible because it just blows all over the place in big clumps.  I decided the only way to tackle the hair is with a vacuum, so I tried our big, bulky vacuum and it was ridiculous.  I'm pregnant with a lot of hip & back pain, so lugging around a huge vacuum won't cut it for me.  I sent my husband out to get a stick vac - he did a lot of research online and came home with this ridiculous futuristic thing, which seemed overpriced compared to other models.  I was very skeptical!  However, I fell in love with it the first time I used it.  It is so effortless!  I hate sweeping and vacuuming, but this almost seems somewhat fun.  It tackles my cathair problem and is great at picking up those tiny litter bits that the cats track around the home.

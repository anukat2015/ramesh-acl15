Title: Nice Vacuum
Content:
This has HEPA filter, light and quiet. It came with a bonus of 2 additional attachment tools. They are not for the end of long wand. It is for the end before the wand, close to the handle.
I like this very much because I have allergy that require HEPA filter.
I also like the hide-away power cord, press a button and the cable all winding into machine.

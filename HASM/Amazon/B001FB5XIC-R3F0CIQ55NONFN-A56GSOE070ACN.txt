Title: Does the job
Content:
This heater keeps the bedroom warm enough that I don't have to turn up the main heat.  The only complaint that I have is when changing to different settings on the heater, the beeps are extremely loud.  Other than that, this heater is doing a great job and isn't too loud even when on full power.

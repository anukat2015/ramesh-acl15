Title: Great Sony Vaio For The Price!
Content:
This is a great Sony Vaio for the price! This is the second Sony Vaio I've owned, the first one lasted 7 years with no issues. I really like the 15.5" LCD Widescreen display, Keyboard, 2.2 GH Intel Duo Core 2 Processor, Windows 7 and 4GB of Ram memory. I also like the look of the computer even in brown, it look's stylish and cool.
I purchased this at BestBuy after Thanksgiving for $649, I believe they still have that price listed. I don't like the battery life, only last about 2 hours fully charged. This is a fast powerful computer for the price and I'm still a fan of Sony Vaio!

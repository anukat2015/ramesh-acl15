Title: MP3 GREAT, VIDEO NOT SO MUCH
Content:
I bought 3 camcorder in 3 days in my hunt to give my 10 year old his own portable camcorder. I bought and returned this Ipod Nano for 1 reason, video camera use. The MP3 is great and all it can do. But if you
think that you are saving money buy getting a video and an MP3,not so much. Video lens is located lower corner back of the unit, which makes your fingers shows all the time if you are not careful. Apple has no existing tripod product to hold the Ipod Nano video while you shoot (unless Moms like me can hold it for a kid).Even if you can buy one on ebay for a diffirent brand, it wont hold up the LANDSCAPE capture which is ideal for youtube upload. The Microphone is great,video quality is great, although no optical or even digital zoom whatsoever, but dont expect too much of the video, just buy an Ipod shuffle for a real MP3 and you get the picture. I am sure the next Ipod Nano will be better, not just this one, does not matter how much GB you are getting...

Title: Awesome laptop, poor battery life.
Content:
I got this laptop as a birthday/graduation gift from my parents and I LOVE it. I can play games such as The Sims 2 with no problems whatsoever. My only complaint would be the battery which only lasts about two hours. Otherwise it is a wonderful computer.

Title: This seems to be a great product!
Content:
I bought this laptop for my 15 year old grandson.  He is technologically saavy, while I am not. He had been specific in telling me that he needed a large memory, and wanted some versatility. I cannot recall the terminology that he used, however he seems to be delighted with his computer and uses it constantly for World of Warcraft, AIM and school work. He talks to people all over the world on this computer, as he has some kind of set-up where he can carry on verbal conversations.  While I wish it had come with longer battery life, HE doesn't seem challenged by that and hasn't mentioned having any problems.  Since HE is happy, I am happy.

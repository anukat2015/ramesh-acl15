Title: Love it, but stopped working after 5 days.
Content:
I bought this model Keurig at Costco, and it stopped pumping water and shutting off after 5 days.  I could have returned to Costco, but that would have been an hour drive each way for me.  I decided to call Keurig.  They said there was a problem and they sent a new one for free.  They said the problem has been corrected.  I hope so, because otherwise I love this machine and would give it 5 stars.

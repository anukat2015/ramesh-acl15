Title: It may be good if it works
Content:
I've used this product for one month and it stopped working, dead! It passed the Amazon return period so I had to go to a factory rep to have it fixed. Well one month later I still don't have my vaccuum!! Electrolux
said it would take a month to get the part. $500 for a vaccuum that doesn't work and a company that doesn't seem to care. Buy a Miele.

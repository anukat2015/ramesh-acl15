Title: poor construction, cheap plastic and suction power
Content:
Oh I miss the European vacuum cleaners. You can actually get someting decent for under $80 there. This one is *relatively* inexpensive but feels really cheap. I bet it won't last long. Suction power is way way way below the average too. Picks up dust quite well but bigger junk doesn't go through.

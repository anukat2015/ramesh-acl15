Title: Good Secondary Heater
Content:
This is an attractive, solid little quartz space heater.  It seems well-built and is the best quality quartz heater I have had so far.
It is not 5 star for the following reasons:
1. Quartz elements are not replaceable with this heater - lifespan for these elements should be approx. 5000 hrs of use. That is max three years use in cold climates - mailing the whole heater to the manufacturer and being gone 6-8 weeks is not an option. So, this is a throw-away heater.
2. No thermostat - I reason that there is no thermostat because the manufacturer is trying to get you to use it sparingly to increase the life of the quartz elements.
This should be a good addition to your primary heater on cold days/nights - just realize it will have a short lifespan.

Title: Great heat when needed!
Content:
I bought this heater to use for projects in my outbuilding. It has worked very well and made working in it very comfortable. We also had our power go out from some storms just recently and I was able to keep our large ranch house fairly warm, around 55 degees or so, for over a day when outdoor temperatures dropped below 30 degrees. As we moved to different areas of the house we moved the heater with us and enjoyed the warmth it gave. I have recommended this unit to all my neighbors and friends. It was GREAT!

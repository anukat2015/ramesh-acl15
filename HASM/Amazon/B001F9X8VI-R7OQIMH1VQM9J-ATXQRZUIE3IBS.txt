Title: Sunbeam Bath Fan Heater with Digital Timer
Content:
Quiet operation. Easy to program. Digital time display. Heats a small sized bathroom efficently.
I like the fact that you can program the heater to turn on at a certain time. It automatically turn itself off or you can do so manually.  It has a built in safety feature so you have to hit the automatic timer within the same 24 hours you want it to automatically come on - in other words you can not program it to automatically come on every day or just any day.  I do not like the fact that it does not turn off if it's accidentaly turned over. It comes with a mounting hook, in case you want to mount it to a surface.

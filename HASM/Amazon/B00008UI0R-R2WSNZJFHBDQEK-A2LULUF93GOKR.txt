Title: Hoover S3765-040
Content:
After 3 months of use, no problems. Performance is outstanding. This unit replaced a ten year old Hoover canister. A great increase in quality, and I know of no othet vac that is as quiet as this one. I purchased while on sale with free shipping and a coupon for a total cost of $144.00 USD.
Local retail was $259.99 USD. As for other reviews critical of the dirt disposal, just remove and carry the filled dirt cup to outside garbage can. Duh! Maybe its just me, I do not empty anything  filled with dirt  indoors! Bottom line: Great product at a great price. The reasons I buy from Amazon.

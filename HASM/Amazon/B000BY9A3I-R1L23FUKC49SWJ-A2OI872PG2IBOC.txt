Title: Great canister vac
Content:
The Dirt Devil Vision Turbo moves smoothly over both carpet and pergo flooring (though the turbo head is much better for carpeting), is convenient to store, has a long cord that easily extends and retracts from the base of the vacuum, and is easy to empty. I also love being able to control the power of the vacuum at the top of the wand vs. having to go back to the base and push a button or flip a switch to turn it on or off or change the settings. Overall, I'm impressed with the quality and price of this vacuum.

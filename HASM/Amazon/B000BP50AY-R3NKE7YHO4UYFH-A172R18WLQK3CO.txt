Title: I would definately recommend this!
Content:
I think this MP3 player is a great buy for the money, the sound is great and the price is right. I was going to buy the I-Pod but it was a little out of my price range, this is a quarter of the cost and works excellently. I wish I could fit more songs on it, but that doesn't take away from the quality.

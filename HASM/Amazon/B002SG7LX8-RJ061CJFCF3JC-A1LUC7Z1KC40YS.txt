Title: NEVER BUY AGAIN FROM AMAZON THIRD PARTY.
Content:
This item (Lenovo Thinkpad X200) was featured on Amazon with Beach Audio as the third party seller for a ridiculously low price of $ 733.
I ordered the item last evening. Beach Audio sends me an email that they will ship the order by this evening. A few hours later I get an email from Amazon that the order has been cancelled!!
Beach Audio didnt even have the courtesy to let me know that they cant fulfill and order. Amazon didnt even bother to send me an explanation. They just curtly told me that it was the Third Party dealers fault.
Horrible experience overall. 
Buyers, please beware of lowball prices posted by Beach Audio. They're probably just tryin to get visitors to their site. Thats all.

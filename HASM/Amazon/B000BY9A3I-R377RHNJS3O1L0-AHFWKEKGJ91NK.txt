Title: A great vacuum for wood floors
Content:
This vacuum is everything that I was expecting.  I agree with the other reviews that the tool attachment area is useless so I just keep the tools in the closet.  I also agree that it does not work well on carpet, but I only have two small area rugs so that isn't a concern for me.  With those two negatives said, I have nothing else bad to say about it.  It sucks up all the hair (we have a keeshond with long, thick hair, and two long haired cats), and I have found the dirt container to be larger than I was expecting.  I am able to vacuum the entire house before I have to empty it.  It hasn't overheated, and I think the 20 foot cord is a good length.  It is lightweight, and the floor tool is flat enough to fit under the couches.  I love that I can adjust the suction with my thumb, and that it's on a continuum.  It stores great.  I would definitely recommend it.

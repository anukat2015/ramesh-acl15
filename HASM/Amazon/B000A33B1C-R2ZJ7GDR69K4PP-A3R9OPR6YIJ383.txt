Title: Good Heater, except the wheels
Content:
I have no complaints about the size, weight or effectiveness about this heater. However, the wheels are this things STINK!!!! I cannot get them to stay attached to the bottom. They are held together by a small piece of metal and do not stay in the holes. I have tried everything from hammering them into place to simply duct taping them. Right now it is leaning with a piece of wood underneath, which makes maneuvering it very difficult.
Other than the wheels, I would recommend this to anyone who needs to heat a small to medium sized room.

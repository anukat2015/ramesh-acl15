Title: Great all-around digital SLR
Content:
After extensive internet searching and comparison, I bough this camera kit. I was tired of out of focus and distorted images from even the best Ultra-compact cameras. 
I saw a friend's photos from a D SLR and was convinced to buy one. I wanted Nikon since I could use all of my Nikkor lenses from the 70's and 80's.
See Ken Rockwell's review. This camera is lightweight and takes photos reminiscent of my old 35 mm SLR's. I also got the external flash since the built in ones are never adequate. This makes a world of difference.

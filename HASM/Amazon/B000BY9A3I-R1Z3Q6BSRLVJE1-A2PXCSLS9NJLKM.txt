Title: Terrible company
Content:
This is my first negative review on Amazon. The vacuum broke within the warranty period. I brought it to an authorized dealer who agreed that it wasn't a user problem and contacted the company. The company refused to pay saying it was the users fault for the handle braking, without even contacting me. 
I went to their website to email them, but its one of those contact forms where the copy of the text is not forwarded. They gave me a standard response saying take it to an authorized dealer even though I said that I did in my original text. The email didn't respond directly to anything I had written. There was no name on the reply, so if I went back and sent another message to them I would have to start the process all over again.
I am in the process of filing complaint with the state and other agencies. Its not the money, but the principle.

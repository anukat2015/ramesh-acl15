Title: Only worked twice
Content:
I received this as a gift and LOVED it -- for 2 days.  The third time I tried to use it, the Power light didn't come on and I noticed that the "on" button was stuck in the depressed position.  I tried plugging it in to different outlets with no luck.  I tried to get the power button unstuck, and that didn't work either.

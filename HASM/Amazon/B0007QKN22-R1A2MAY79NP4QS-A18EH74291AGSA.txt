Title: Extra Info ***
Content:
If it where weather sealed (dust), it would be Pro Quality!
With the included software, you can connect this camera with your PC and shoot photo's directly to your PC. I used two 5ft USB extection cables along with the included USB cable, and had no trouble shooting 81 photo's so far.
Initial battery charge lasted 76 RAW shots @ 96% flash usage. (stock flash & 18-55mm kit lense).
Opteka Battery Pack Grip is a good option at half the street price of Canons Battery Grip (same product).
The kit lense is worth the small price, if you'll ever get into a dusty situation that you wouldn't want to use a more expensive lense in. (In my opinion.)
RAW images have averaged 6.44MB, and (for example) one image saved as RAW + JPEG == 6.88MB RAW and 6.45MB jpg === 13.33MB total. (This is just one image example, but it gives you an idea of what memory cards to get -> 1-2GB) Type II Compact Flash is the reccomended memory card. Anything faster will not improve camera speed... only "download to PC speed".
Self timer is 10 seconds, and I cannot change it to 2 seconds, although you can change setting to "Mirror Lockup: On" which will then give a "2 second delay" while using the self timer function.
Adorama Camera shipped my Canon Rebel XT w/ kit lense FASTER than Amazon shipped my 75-300mm USM lense. Don't be affraid to order from them though Amazon. I almost was, but am glad I did. That's why I shot direct to my PC... waiting for memory card, lense, hood, and Cannon UV Haze Filter.
Read the manual. I LOVE this camera!!!

Title: Gorgeous laptop!
Content:
This is amazing laptop! Gorgeous display, extremely useful trackpad, powerful CPU, lots of RAM, very solid feel (because of unibody aluminum frame).
I was afraid that there would be lots of glare on this glossy glass screen, but it turned out that you don't see any glares if you use laptop indoors and we use it indoors only. Also it is so nice and easy to wipe this glass screen!
We really liked software which comes out of the box. Mac OS X Snow Leopard is so quick and so handy! And iLife 09 is just brilliant. We really liked the way iPhoto recognizes faces and with this feature we sorted out all our photo collection - thats awesome!
This laptop is great for home, but it is as well great for work. We installed Adobe CS3 suite (I just don't have CS4 yet) and iWork 09. These things work really well!
We bought this model because we need reasonably large screen and high performance to work with Adobe Flash/In Design and so on, but at the same time we wished laptop to be rather lightweight. This model fits our expectations really well.
And we didn't choose 15" with better graphic chip, because we don't play games.

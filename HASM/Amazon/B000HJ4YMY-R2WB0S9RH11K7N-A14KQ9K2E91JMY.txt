Title: Good camera but worst owner manual I have seen!
Content:
D80 is a feature laden camera for sure, however, it has the worst owner manual with really cheap print to go with it.  I remember my Nikon FA's owner manual which has a concise ilustration and a quality glossy print.  This manual is like someon stapled it from a copier! This camera has a wealth of features but the illustrations were poorly organized, jump back and forth makes it hard to follow, definitely not user friendly.  No wonder there are a lot of DVD/books on the operations of D80.  You have to buy another software from Nikon to do some advanced work, why?  Why can't Nikon provide us a well organized manual with a DVD.  Why do we have to BUY from another source.  Do you buy another car manual from else where to supplement the owner manual?  Do you buy a manual for your plasma TV or receiver to augment the manual from the mfg?  Why can't Nikon do it right!  Nikon should know that it sells a QUALITY camera, you need to have a quality MANUAL to go with it, not as an after thought. This leaves a bad taste in the mouth for a, otherwise well made product.

Title: Two outta three ain't bad
Content:
I purchased three of these as Christmas presents. My eight-year old loved it...until she realized the lanyard clip didn't work (we then used a twist tie to hold the lanyard on), the key ring thing broke, and then the player stopped playing altogether! She did not abuse this in the least. We returned it for a refund. The other two are still working fine but don't get nearly as much use. I also recommend buying a rechargeable player, as this one eats batteries. We replaced my daughter's player with a ZenV by Creative, which I highly recommend.

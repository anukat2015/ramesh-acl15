Title: A very nice Laptop
Content:
I just received this laptop, and let me tell you, it is a very nice one, I paid an overall amount of 850.00 dollars including S/H and my countries taxes ( I am from Guatemala, Central America). This laptop exceeds my expectations. I have read some reviews saying that the Delete button is not well placed, I think they're wrong, to me it is in the right place (above de Backspace). It looks very elegant, and feels very solid. I dont think I have to describe the specifications(you can go to HP.com and find out), but I must say 2 things (they are not big deal to me but probably for you): It doesnt have the IEEE 1394 port, and doesnt have FingerPrint reader. To me, 5 stars!!!! very happy!! Did I mention that the Logo lights on! pretty cool....

Title: Get the camera. Skip the lenses!
Content:
I bought this very same kit in April.  It's a great kit!  The camera is great, bla bla bla.  I think everyone's already beaten that horse to death. Plenty of reviews here on how great the camera is, and I agree with them.  But I have to say, compared to the other lenses made for the e500 (and other e-system DLSRs), these kit lenses are pretty bad.  The kit lenses are a great starter.  And they're worlds better than anything you'll get with a point-and-shoot.  But having replaced  both of these lenses with better ones, I regret spending the money on the kit initially.  I feel I should have just bought the body, and a separate lens (the 14-54 NON KIT lens is freakin' amazing!).  That's my advice to you.  Definitely get this camera.  The image quality is on par with similar offerings from Nikon and Canon, and it has the same, or very similar features.  But if I were you I'd get the e500 body ONLY rather than the kit.  Buy the body, buy a good lens separately.  Yeah, you'll pay a little more, but the quality you'll get will be worth it.  Especially if you think you may upgrade your lens later on anyway.  Trust me.  Spend a little more now, and it'll literally save you about $200 later.
Buying a DSLR means buying into that maker's lens system. You're not just buying an e500 here, you're also buying into Olympus's lens system.  And that's a very good system to buy into.  Olympus Zuiko lenses are incredible, both in the image quality they give you, as well as their performance.  
As far as lenses go, I'd suggest you buy--seperately--the 14-54 Zuiko lens (Olympus 14-54mm f/2.8-3.5 Zuiko ED Digital SLR Lens for E1, E300 & E500 Cameras).  Careful not to confuse it with the 14-45 lens that comes with the kit.  It's not the same lens at all, and not at all in the same class.  
The 18-150mm lens may sound tempting, but don't bother with it.  It's of the same build quality, and has the same image quality and performance as the kit lens.  The 14-54 is built like a tank and the image quality will blow you away.
Hope this helps somebody

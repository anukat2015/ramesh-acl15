Content:
I recently spent the weekend with my 5 yr old niece.  She walked around the whole weekend with my ipod on.  she loves it.  I asked her if she could buy one whick color would she get?  Of course her choice was pink.  I was learing of buying a used product, but this looked like you had just purchased it in a store.  the CD, manual, earplugs all came in the original box.  It was just as the seller said it was, if not better.

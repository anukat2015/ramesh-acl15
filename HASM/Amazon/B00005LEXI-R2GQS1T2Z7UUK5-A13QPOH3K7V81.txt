Title: Item is worth buying - very satisfied
Content:
Mr. Buddy propane heater has been very reliable and safe.  I use this heater in the family room with a 20 Gal propane tank.  The heater is able to kick up the room temperature enough to feel extra comfortable.  I would not advise using the heater in a small room space due to CO2 displacement.  My home is 3000 Sq Ft so the rooms are spacious.  This heater is perfect for my application. Whats nice is that the heater is mobile and I can move it from room to room depending on where the family is sitting.  Once piece of advise... when you are finished using the heater for the day, store the heater outside the house.  A garage is perfect for this.

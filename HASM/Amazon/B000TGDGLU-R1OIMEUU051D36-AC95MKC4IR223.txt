Title: Reliable for a year so far
Content:
I live in the foggy city where temperatures are consistently low. I've been using this pretty much every day for a full year, so my opinion is based on heavy and frequent use of this radiator. I have nothing but positive things to say.
- It is space friendly, as it is somewhat compact.
- It is durable. I've kicked it around a bit, it doesn't tip very easily and is made of strong plastic and metal. It has never broken down despite my clumsiness knocking into it or knocking it into my furniture.
It is oxygen friendly. Unlike the two or three fan-based heaters I've had over the last 5 years, this does not suck the oxygen out of the room. My fan-based heaters left me warm but suffocating, and this does not.
- It is safe. I've accidently left it on walking out the door, and it has never shorted or burned anything except my sense of responsibility. I can't say its impossible, but within reasonable use my experience with it is that you'd probably have to place a box of tinder on it to actually get something to catch fire. The design is quite sensible, as the base is a little larger than the actual heated tower, discouraging you from accidently putting the radiator close to debris.
- As for heating power, here is a reference point: I use this in my bedroom with hardwood floors and drywall walls. The room is about 15 feet by 15 feet, and this little guy heats the room up in 5 to 10 minutes on the medium setting. I've never found it necessary to go any higher than medium.
This is a wonderfully priced solid radiator.

Title: Bummed
Content:
I purchased this item for my laminate floors as we have laminate throughout for the purpose of a wheelchair.  The idea of being able to vac and then wash was great and thought it would be easier on my back than a mop. I found this to be true. The issue with it standing upright I found to be true as indicated in a previous review. Most importantly though, the trigger that lets the solution out onto the floor died after a month.The closest place that handles their product warranties is 45 minutes away from us (and I live in a big city).  In addition, the place that does handle the warranties told me this problem is common with this product. Needless to say, I opted not to get this fixed and am out the money I spent on the product. The hassle of carting it 45 mins. to have to go back again to pick it up when done brings me to a total of 3 hours on the road with no guarantee that the next trigger will be any better.

Title: Amazon and Apple..Great mix!!! 5/5
Content:
I ordered this ipod to gift somebody..Initially I received an empty box in mail. I was really frustrated to see an empty box with all packaging and order receipt. I called Amazon and they handled situation with great sense of customer relationship. They reordered same item for me immediately and sent through an upgraded mail at no extra cost to me. At this time I must apploud Amazon for great customer care and sense of urgency..
As expected the ipod is the best. In contrary to some reviews on this board, I was able to use multiple ipods on same laptop to update songs.
Shuffle's size, sound quality and battery life are really enough for the price..

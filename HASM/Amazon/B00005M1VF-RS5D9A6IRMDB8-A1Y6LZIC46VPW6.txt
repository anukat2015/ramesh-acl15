Title: Did Not Meet My Expectations
Content:
The Two-to-Go Coffeemaker worked fine for the first few weeks of heavy use but by the third week, the machine was only making about enough coffee to fill one of the containers.  We believe that grounds may have gotten in the drip device which lays right ontop of the grounds and is part and parcel of what I believe to be a bad design. When it was working right, it produced a great cup of coffee, but now it will soon be replaced.

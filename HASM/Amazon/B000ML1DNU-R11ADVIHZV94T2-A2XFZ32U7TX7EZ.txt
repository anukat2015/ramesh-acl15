Title: Great vacuum, but waaaaay over priced.....
Content:
I own this vacuum and it is really great on hard-wood and tiled floors, but DO NOT buy if you have a lot of carpet in your home because, like others have said, it will not work well on carpet. On other floors you shouldn't find any trouble at all. JUST DON'T GO OVER SCREWS, or really big objects, AND THINGS THAT MIGHT ROLL AROUND THE ATTACHMENTS OR THEY WILL SURELY NOT WORK WELL AND MAYBE EVEN BREAK (as with all other vacuums)!
Another thing: this vacuum is way overpriced at amazon.com!!!!! I bought this vacuum for $76 at SEARS about a year ago and it is still in great condition and I use it a lot considering that I have to constantly clean up after my kids. Check out the prices at other stores before considering to buy it here. This vacuum may run for probably about $100 now at SEARS...

Title: Relatively quiet, but lousy thermostat
Content:
Got one of these for use in my office at work as my office gets a little cold during the Winter months.  The size and features fit my need well, but the thermostat is so insensitive I find myself turning the unit on and off manually in most cases.
Positive points:
- Small
- Relatively quiet
- Great heat output
Negative points:
- Lousy thermostat
- The power cord actually gets hot during operation! Fire hazard?

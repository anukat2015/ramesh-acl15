Title: Great and easy coffee and tea!
Content:
I received my B60 for Christmas and I am very pleased with how well it works. It is so easy and there are so many varieties of coffee to try, that it is a winner. 
I've also tried the tea varieties and this is a good way to make a fast cup of tea. 
I recommend this coffee maker and going to the Keurig site to buy samples of teas and coffees before buying a lot of any flavor. I did not do that and one of the lemon tea brands is too lemony. Keurig also includes an 18 cup variety pack, so make a few of them and discover what flavors are to your liking. 
The brewer allows you to experiment with the size cup you make. Use this to vary the strength of your tea and coffee. It also has a water temperature control. I recommend keeping it on the hottest - as it is not too hot. If you like really hot coffee, this is sort of a drawback.
I recommend the Keuring B60 if you like real coffee instead of instant but can't be bothered making a full pot just for yourself.

Title: Canon Quality and their fun to use cameras
Content:
Since going digital a number of years ago, my family and I have only used Canon cameras.  We still have a number of SD Powershots which are nice pocket sized cameras for those family birthday parties.  I also use a Powershot S5 IS for it's long zoom lens at sporting events.  Now I've got the Rebel Xsi, an SLR for high quality photos during weekend trips to San Francisco, Monterey, landscapes, family portraits, etc.  I can't believe that this sub-$1000 camera is referred to as an entry level camera.  I can only imagine what their big pro cameras are like.  Any ways, this camera is easy to use, I added the Speedlite 270 EZ for better flash photos of large groups indoors, a battery grip, filters, etc.  No regrets on this purchase.  Prints are absolutely gorgeous.  I didn't want the XTi model as I already have a camcorder, didn't want to use an SLR for movies.

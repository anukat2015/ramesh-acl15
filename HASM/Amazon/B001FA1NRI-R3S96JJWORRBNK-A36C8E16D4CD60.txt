Title: Exactly what I was looking for
Content:
I already own an 80GB video Ipod. I bought the shuffle to hold a few hours worth of music and to be extremely light and portable. It does all of that, along with excellent battery life. When I have this strapped on my shirt or pants when I working out, I can  barely even tell it is there. I also use it when I am traveling on my motorcycle, I just clip it onto my tank bag and I can even use the controls with my gloves on. I did buy my own pair of headphones though.

Title: 29KWh in 13hrs of use.
Content:
I bought this to keep my basement warm in the cold New England winter... thought it might be more efficient than the ceramic convection heater I had.. I checked my meter last night to see what it was and to compare to this morning. Nothing else on other than an alarm clock, coffee maker light and cell phone chargers. 29KWh overnight. Temp in the basement? 44 degrees. Its has been plugged in since Friday morning, so 4 days of being able to get itself up to temp.
If someone knows whats going on with it let me know. Maybe its too cold down there for it to heat up and run efficiently? That could be the case but why would there be an antifreeze setting, which specifically is meant to keep things from 40-42 degrees. I am going to compare my convection heater wattage usage, but 99% sure this is going back to the store. I am not looking forward to the electric bill this month.

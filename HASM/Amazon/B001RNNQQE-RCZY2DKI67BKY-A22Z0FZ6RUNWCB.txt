Title: Great White Coffee Maker!
Content:
I received this Coffee Maker last Friday. First of all, as another reviewer mentioned, I love the clean white/stainless steel look, and the small footprint. I have a very small kitchen and it fits easily on the counter. Second, it comes with its own charcoal filter to filter the water with, but since I use Britta water in my coffee maker, I did not install the charcoal filter that came with the coffee maker. And last, but not least, it makes great coffee. I pre-heat the stainless steel carafe with hot water while I am measuring the coffee and adding the water (remember to empty the carafe before putting into the coffee maker though).
Yes, the carafe does pour slowly because it is trying to keep the heat in, but not so slowly that I find it annoying. Since my second cup is my last cup, I just take the lid off. As far as it beeping too loudly, it doesn't bother me. That way if I am in the bedroom I can hear the coffee is done. The beeping is not nearly as annoying as my clothes dryer beeping 16 times!
For the price, and the fact that it has a 3 year warranty, looks great, is a Cuisinart, makes great coffee quickly, and is small for a 10 cupper, I give this 5 stars.

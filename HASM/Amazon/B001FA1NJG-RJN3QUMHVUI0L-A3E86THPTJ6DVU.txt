Title: The Best MP3 Player
Content:
I was shopping for an MP3 player for several months and narrowed it down to Zune and I-Pod.  I have had the Zune 120 for 2 months now. The Zune won me over because it has so much more to offer than the I-Pod.  FM tuner, Wifi, Sharing capabilities, Larger screen, click or glide controls, etc. Even little things like selecting your own screensaver. I downloaded both the Itunes and Zune software and found the Zune software was easier to use and more organized. It was also very easy to learn. The video quality is excellent and my picures looks great on it's sleek 3.2" screen.  The only thing I did not like were the ear phones. I would recommend buying them seperately. I have had no technical problems or issues with the software. When showing my Zune to I-Pod owners most say they wish they bought a Zune.

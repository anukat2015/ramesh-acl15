Title: Great still works wonderful after almost 5 years
Content:
We are actually getting ready to upgrade to a nicer 12-cup maker so I was on amazon checking out reviews and thought I would share how great this machine has been for us.  I have had it almost 5 years now and it still works wonderfully.  It is easy to use and the carafe keeps coffee hot for about 3 hours.  We are heavy coffee drinkers and it has held up great for us.  I am going to pass this on to my brother when we gets our new one cause it still works great.

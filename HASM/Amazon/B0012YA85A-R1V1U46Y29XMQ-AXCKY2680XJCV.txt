Title: Awesome Camera!
Content:
This is my first DSLR camera. I've owned a Canon point & shoot for a while (SD1000). I've always loved the image quality of Canon's lenses, so I decided to purchase this camera after many positive reviews. I'm hoping to master this DSLR and upgrade down the road, and hopefully I'll be able to make a career out of professional photography. 
Out of the box, I was amazed at the high-quality construction and sturdy feel. Many people say this camera feels awfully light, which may be true compared to the higher-end camera's, but I felt it was really sturdy. 
The kit lens works wonders. Nothing AMAZING, but its a great lens, capable of quality images and I couldnt be happier. It's a great lens to start out with and can definitely capture some rather great images. Matter of fact, with the use of photoshop and/or lightroom, you could easily fool people that this camera & lens is that of a Canon Mark series the "L" lens series (well, maybe). 
I've uploaded a few test images, straight out of the box on day one. Nothing special, and I have NO photography experience (other than the typical 'point & shoot' variety). So far, I'm pretty excited. Can't wait to learn more tricks and tips, and purchase some more lenses down the road.
If your a beginner, like me, this camera and kit lens will not disappoint. I'm very happy with my purchase.

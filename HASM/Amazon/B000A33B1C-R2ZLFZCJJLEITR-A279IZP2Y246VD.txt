Title: Delonghi "The Dragon"
Content:
This is a pretty good unit. Yes it has a safety feature if it is tipped over, and for the most part is toddler safe. Also I consider this unit to have a one to two second touch delay (meaning if you touch the louvers you have about one to two seconds to remove your hand, remember it gets hot). Ok now to the real questions. How much does it heat? I have tried a lttle of everthing, big rooms and small rooms. So here is the best answers you are going to get. This unit works best if you have a regular ceiling ( not vaulted ). Also your room should be about the size of a living room 17 foot square about, give or take a foot or two. It should be closed off to any other rooms, by a door or a curtain of some type. You do this and you'll have no regrets. One last thing, when you turn it on for the first couple of times you will smell the paint on the unit getting broken in. After that I have noticed no smell. My unit doesn't have any oil leaks what so ever, but if yours does by some chance return it asap (because it won't do you any good to have a leaky oil radiant heater). I give this a 4 out of 5 stars.

Title: Decent Noisy Space Heater
Content:
If you work in an office, making calls all the time, and need quiet then this is not your first choice of product.
I chuckle when I turned on the fan....it doesn't really reach far in terms of blowing air.
Give it a chance to heat and the immediate area will improve quickly, and then the heat will disperse slowly warming the rest of the room. It's just not designed to heat a whole room. 
The whole unit is roughly the size of a gallon of milk.
It is a small unit. It can double as a noise machine ... it's perfect for that, too.
Definitely designed for a small room or to aim at your feet from under your desk.
Worth the cost  -- for a small room like a bedroom or a cubicle or an office.

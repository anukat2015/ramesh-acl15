Title: Mr. Buddy Heater
Content:
We live in Northern Maine and had a real problem keeping the back side of our house warm.  This heater has been wonderful for us.  It is effective, very portable, heats the room quickly, there is no odor, it's easy to use, we have yet to use the high setting as it quickly heats the room on medium and maintains it on low.  For the price, it was much better then 3 different electric heaters we tried. The biggest draw back is that we have to use the small 1 pound tanks and change them regularly.

Title: excellent camera!!!
Content:
I am not a pro but I wanted to get a high end DSLR which would help take excellent photos at night. This camera serves that purpose and much more. It is a bit pricy for a beginners DSLR, but if you have the money go for it. 
I also read reviews elsewhere that canon's cameras do a better job at capturing colors vs Nikon. That was another reason to go with canon instead of Nikon.

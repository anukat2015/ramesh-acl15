Title: Great while it lasted.
Content:
I bought two of these last winter to help with the heating bill.  They worked great until they burnt out.  The first one made it about six months then we noticed the thermostat became very incosistent.  Shortly after that it turned off and would not turn back on.  The second one made it almost to the end of its second winter, but bit it just like the first one.  I wish they would have lasted longer than they did.

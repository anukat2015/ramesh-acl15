Title: I love this camera!
Content:
This is a wonderful camera. I am not a professional photographer, but have been taking wildlife and sports  photographs since the early '70s (Nikon F2). I still have it...
The D80 is my first foray into digital SLRs (I first bought a Nikon Coolpix to "test the waters" and loved it). I must admit, I put an awful lot of thought into this purchase. Money is, of course, a major consideration. I really want the D300, but this is out of my price range right now. I vacillated between the D80 and the D90, but finally decided that the video feature (which I would NEVER use, the Live View (which I would not use either)and the added 2MP were not worth the additional cost-I would rather transfer that amount of money to lenses. As a result, I went with the D80 body and two lenses-an 18-55mm and a 70-300 VR zoom lenses. All of my photography is handheld because I rarely have time to set up a tripod. I shoot in a completely manual or aperature priority mode and I really, really like the way the D80 responds and the photographs I get. Not least of all, I especially like the way I can change the ISO from photograph to photograph, depending on the range and visual conditions. And finally, I have some very fast Nikon AF lenses that I think will work in the manual mode.
All in all, I am exceptionally pleased with this camera and would recommend it to anyone.

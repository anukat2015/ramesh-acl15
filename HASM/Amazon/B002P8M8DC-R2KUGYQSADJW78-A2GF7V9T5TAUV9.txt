Title: two weeks and hard drive failed
Content:
The computer had a great list of features and for the price was a very good deal. Two weeks and the hard drive failed. Toshiba did replace it free but I had to go to a repair shop of their choice 30 miles form me.  The repair took a week. I think I will go back to Dell next time.

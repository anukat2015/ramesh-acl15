Title: Great Idea - Inferior Product
Content:
I purchased theVornado EH1-0036-46 TouchStone Vortex Heater but had to return it. 
Although a beautifully crafted piece of equipment, it did not raise the temperature of the room one degree. I did my best to follow the manuel and place it in the room so it could do it's "vortexing" but it did not work in my case. I though it might have been room placement but I when I stand in front of the heater the air came out lukewarm at best and never got hotter. I didn't think a room could get hotter then the air that is being pumped around it but I left it on for a hour. Sure enough the room never did get hotter. I tried this 3 more times on separate occasions but the results were the same. Too bad because it is a piece of art and has a little remote control which I liked. I did consider keeping it for the fan part because I liked the way it circulated the air in the room and it was quiet. In the end, I returned it since $179 is too much to pay for a fan.

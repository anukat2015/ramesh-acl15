Title: Perfect Little Heater
Content:
We've had other small heaters, but they always fail.  This one is perfect.  It gives off a good bit of heat, is not that loud and takes up such a small amount of space, which was exactly what we were looking for.  Although there are 3 settings (fan only, heat 1, heat 2), it should be noted that the fan always stays the same.  The fan does NOT get stronger with heat 2.  The difference between heat 1 and heat 2 is just that the coils get hotter with heat 2.  We use this great little space heater in our bathroom each morning to keep the mirrors and windows from fogging up and to warm up the bathroom.  You can feel a good bit of heat from 6 feet.  Some of the bad reviews had initially made us thinking twice about getting it.  But unless you get a lemon, which I'm sure they'll replace since it comes with a warranty, don't listen to them.  Overall, considering how inexpensive it is, this is just the Perfect Little Heater.  We're so glad we bought it.

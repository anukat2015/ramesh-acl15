Title: Very happy with my new camera!
Content:
This is the second Canon Rebel camera that I have had.  The first was a 35mm that I loved and was very happy to purchase the same in digital. I haven't had it very long to be able to compare the quality of the photos but so far I really like that the feel of the camera is similar and the shutter speed is fast. I also purchased the same camera so that my old lenses would fit.   It is very easy to use, turn it on, take off the lens cap and shoot.

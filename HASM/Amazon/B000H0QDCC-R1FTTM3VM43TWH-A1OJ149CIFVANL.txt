Title: As a present, it was a good choice
Content:
I'm not yet a Zune fan, but this unit does do well. Microsoft had a good idea to put out a mp3 player that also played video. These are reliable. The "red" is sort of a faded red, but the machine itself is really good. I made good points for picking this one up as a birthday present.
 It arrived well packaged, and has worked as promised ever since.

Title: The best iPod
Content:
This is my first iPod because previously I didn't need one. I wasn't which one to buy but the nano 3g was the one because:
 - it is small
 - has enough storage space
 - compatible with nike+
 - i can put it in my pocket
My music collection is around 20GB but there are a lot of songs that I dont like anymore so 8GB is enough for music + podcasts. Currently I am only using like 2GB.
The screen size and quality is just perfect.

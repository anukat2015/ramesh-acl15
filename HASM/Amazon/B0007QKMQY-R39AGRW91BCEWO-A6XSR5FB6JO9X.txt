Title: Great Camera, Great Value
Content:
This camera is an amateur photographer's dream.  It's compatible with all current generation lenses (unlike the higher-dollar Canons).  The kit lens is quite good quality but you may not be happy with its performance indoors.  Make sure you also look into getting one of the inexpensive prime lenes (prime = non-zoom).  The Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II is an excellent value.

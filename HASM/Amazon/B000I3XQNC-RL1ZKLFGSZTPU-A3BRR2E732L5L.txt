Title: Great camera!
Content:
I love this camera!  The only thing I wish it had is spot metering, but I see the new Xsi camera has this now.  I got this camera with a 24-70mm & 70-200mm lenses, both 2.8 aperture.  I can not believe how great the photos turn out.  I would highly recommend this camera along with the 2.8 lenses.

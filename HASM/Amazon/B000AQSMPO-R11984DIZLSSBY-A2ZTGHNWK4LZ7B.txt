Title: Great Machine, Weak Coffee
Content:
This machine is great.  I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas.  Go to Linens N Things--I got it for $75.00!!!  The machine looks cool, seems durable, brews coffee amazingly fast, and requires virtually no clean up.  I am a tea drinker and use teabags.  So I also use the machine for instant piping hot water.  My only complaint is the coffee.  If you like really strong coffee, the K cups aren't gonna do it for ya.  Even if we brew an Extra Bold cup in  6 oz of water, it still tastes watery to us.  I'm thinking about trying out the reusable filter.

Title: So far so good

I rate this 4 stars because to me, 5 is perfection and I can't promise this heater IS perfect.
I bought two of these based on the reviews I read. I've used them a few times and am very happy. There is a bad smell the first times you plug it in so I put my second one (I bought it a week later) outside on high setting for a whole day. No smell in subsequent uses indoor.
I use them in a log cabin with small rooms at half setting and number 2, one per bedroom. It's more than enough (I like comfy--70º) and uses less electricity that way. The breakers went off when I had the two using both "on" switches on each. Using just one "on" switch on each caused no further problem and the temperature stayed the same.
The heaters are not too small, not too big, not too heavy, not bad/cheap looking and seem well made. I also like that they're safe and won't start a fire even if they ever tipped over by accident. The wheels are far apart enough so there's no chance it would happen but, safety first! All things considered, the price is correct. Order early and get the free shipping; that makes it an even better deal.

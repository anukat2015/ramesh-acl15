Title: Package lies about mp3 abilites!!!
Content:
Bought it to listen to mp3 files I have.  Can't because of the bad Sony software that comes with it.  Ok ok, actually I could, IF I burn a cd first of what I want then transfer that to minidisc........  To load a blank minidisc with about 2 1/2 hours of music took about a hour total.  This involved using the sony clunky software to get a playlist, convert said list to the minidisc file format, transfer files to minidisc.  The conversion from mp3 to the sony format took about 45 minutes, and the transfer to the minidisc at least 20 minutes.  This was on a pretty zippy P4 2gig machine!  Irked me a little at the time involved but could live with it, then I found out you can only do this 3 times........... after that you have to reconvert the song again.  This is Sony trying to stop song piracy.....Frankly I don't give a whoop about Sony losing a dime from piracy and think they have ruined what is a great hardware product with absolutely terrible software.  As seems the case with most sony items I have, they like to add about 5 steps more than are needed.   SOOO I have returned this player to buy a Rio mp3 player instead.  So far that the Rio is great and had it up and running in 20 minutes when the sony took almost 2 hours............Can not recommend this item for mp3, for straight cd to minidisc it is ok.......but why not get a regular mp3 player instead and have more flexible product?

Title: Good, but too bright!
Content:
I bought this to replace a Presto Heat Dish that broke.  Overall I'm happy with it. It heats well and I like that it oscillates like a fan (in fact it basically looks like a fan with a heater core).  It's also nice that the low setting uses half of the energy as the Heat Dish.  My only complaint and warning is that this thing is BRIGHT!  On the high setting, you literally cannot look at it--it's like looking directly into the sun.  You either have to squint or wear sunglasses.  The Heat Dish was like having fire place lighting but this is like having a blinding spot light shone in your face.

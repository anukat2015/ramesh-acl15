Title: Personal Protection Equipment
Content:
I just received order.....price was right. This is not a furnace...I tested it for next adventure.  This is a flameless radiant heater....its effect is radiation upon objects like your body or furniture....infrared. Designed to be close to you....NOT a space heater that warms air. Read and understand instructions....  I had a single burner propane stove in my tent safely overnight but when I stood up, flame burned my shirt.  'Buddy' has no flame but safety precautions must be heeded.  It can be used outdoors to heat you in work area lacking wind.  If power goes out, ideal 'in your face.' Fuel (propane disposable bottles) is inexpensive and readily available.  'Buddy' is large compared to radiation area but light in weight and very safe.  In a cold confined space, 'Buddy' is better than hot Campbells tomatoe soup.  The 'Big Buddy' heater may be better as it uses two elements and two propane bottles for not much more in cost and has option  of  electric  fan.

I loved them.  I bought 3, one in each color.  The kids that I bought them for absolutely love them.....
Only one little flaw.  I used a small peice of velcro to hold the bottom door closed.  Other than that, it is a smash hit.  The ages I bought them for were 1 - Girl age 3yrs., 1 - Boy age 3 1/2yrs., and 1 - Boy 4 1/2 yrs. old.  They all can operate them with ease.....
It is a GREAT buy!

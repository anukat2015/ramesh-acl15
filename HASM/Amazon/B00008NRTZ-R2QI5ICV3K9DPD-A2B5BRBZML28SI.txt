Title: Works for me!
Content:
I seem to be one of the few customers who really likes this vacuum.  Mine works great for me.  I do agree with the people who complained about the hepa filtration.  It's not very good for this feature.  I have a wonderful air purifier that takes care of that department.  I have had my vacuum for about three years now, and it is the best one I have owned.  It's easy to maneuver, it lifts my carpets and cleans deep down.  It also works well on my hardwood floors.  I don't have a problem with the vacuum not cleaning next to furniture because I move everything.  I like the feature that allows me to lower the power level so that I can change the attachments and clean my drapes while they are still hanging.  That extra dust that seems to collect on them doesn't stand a chance.  I don't have any dogs or cats in the house, so I'm sure this will give the vacuum longer life.  I don't like vacuuming stairs, though.  Because they are carpet, this poses a problem, but I don't know any vacuum that wouldn't.  I have to hold the canister while vacuuming so I get a little work-out in the process.  For this reason, it helps that the vacuum is light.  I do love the attachments; I have used them ALL!  It's a really good vacuum!

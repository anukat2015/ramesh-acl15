Title: Love It!
Content:
I am amazed at how much dirt and hair this vacuum pick up.  Even after having my carpets professionally cleaned, the Hoover WindTunnel picked up even more hair and dirt.  The only downside to this vac is that I have to empty the container after each vac, but considering I have a 4 bedroom house with 4 kids and 2 dogs maybe that is not surprising.  Highly recommend, Amazon delivered fast and without any hassles.

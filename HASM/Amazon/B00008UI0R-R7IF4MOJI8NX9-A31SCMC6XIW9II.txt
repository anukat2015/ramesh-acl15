Title: Best Bang for the Buck
Content:
I am a researchaholic and on the cheap side, so far this vacuum has fit the bill. When I had narrowed my choices down I was torn between this Hoover and the Electrolux Harmony. The deciding factor was the washable filters that the Hoover is equipped with. As a pet owner frequent vacuuming is a way of life so I didn't feel like being a slave to the cost of the disposable bags and hepa filters of the Electrolux. I can recommend the Hoover Wind Tunnel canister vac with confidence however I can't attest to it's longetivy as I haven't had it very long. I will say that Amazon.com is by far the best way to shop online. Two thumbs way up for Amazon! :)

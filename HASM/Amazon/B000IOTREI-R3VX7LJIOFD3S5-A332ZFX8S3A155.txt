Title: Nice direct heat
Content:
After trying a different model on Amazon with disappointing results, I purchased this model in black at my local Costco.  It does not give off an annoying bright light like the one I initially purchased.  Although I liked the heat this gave off, I ended up returning this due to the fact that its fixed angle limits its ability to direct heat where you want it.  
I live in a loft that has 16 ft ceilings so I figured this would be perfect to beam heat on me while laying my sofa, without having to heat my whole apartment.  I have lower modern style furniture, and with this thing on the floor the heat was going right over me.  It seems like its fixed angle is designed to hit you on your upper body/face area when you are sitting upright.  My feet tend to get cold so I like the heat to be focused on my lower body.  The only way to get this thing to work to my liking was to prop one of my old textbooks under it from the rear to lower the angle of the heat. Needless to say, for the price I shouldn't have to do this; I returned it.   
Also as others have mentioned, the night light is useless and the tip warning buzzer is very annoying.  Another thing I noticed was that the dial thermostat doesn't actually lower the power of the heating element (like a light bulb dimmer) for less heat.  It actually cycles off and on continuously to provide less heat.
PS. My cat loved this heater!  He would just stand directly in front of the unit and bask in the warmth.

Title: Going back......again!
Content:
This heater has a serious design flaw with the thermostat.
After the initial warm-up the heater cuts off and on at very short intervals (seconds) with the thermostat turned all the way up. I took the 1st one back thinking it was an individual problem. Now I've got to take this one back. I wish it worked like it looks!

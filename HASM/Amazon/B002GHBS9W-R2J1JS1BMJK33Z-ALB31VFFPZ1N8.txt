Title: Works for me!
Content:
I don't get the spills everyone is talking about from the carafe. Maybe they fixed it.
I ran water thru it the first time and measured the temp at 176 degrees farenheit.
Plenty hot for me and I add cold half and half.
I love the filter inside the water reservoir. 
It filters water before it gets to the element where it can clog things up.
Even if it only lasts for 6 months I feel I got my money's worth.
It's an inexpensive coffee maker. You can't expect too much.

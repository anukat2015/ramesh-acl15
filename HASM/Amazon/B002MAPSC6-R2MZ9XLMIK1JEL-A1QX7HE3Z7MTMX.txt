Title: 5 out 5 bad head phone jacks do not buy!
Content:
Over the last six months I purchased five Sansa products. 3 Fuzes and 2 Clips, all brand new and every single one had faulty head phone jacks. If you inserted the headphones and seated it all the way down so it is tight there was no sound. In order to hear anything at all I had to pull the head set out a fraction of an inch. Now any little bump, twist or nudge and the sound would sputter or cut out completely, making me fidget with the connection over and over again. After buying and exchanging 3 units I decided to wait a few months to see if it was a production problem. In the beginning of 2010 I bought another Clip, and low and behold, the same exact problem. One more exchange and now we were up to 5 Sansa MP3 players with the same issue. Never again, I bought a Sony e344 Walkman and it's been perfect.

Title: Make sure you get the warranty
Content:
I was very eager to get my HP Pavilion only to find that they all have an overheating problem that leads to a shot motherboard.  Unfortunately even if you replace the motherboard the heating issue will not be repaired so you can look forward to replacing another motherboard until you buy a Mac in frustration.  HP will not admit this is a design flaw and they need to address this so until then Bye-bye PC, Hello Mac.

Title: love this vacuum in a house of pets!
Content:
The reviews we read were right on; we have a black lab and 2 cats, all of whom shed and bring in dirt.  We filled up a bag on the first vacuum with this Electrolux, and are happy with its performance and manageability.  It folds up very small so as to be unobtrusive and is easy to use.  Wish we'd discovered this unit prior to buying other vacuums that do not come close in performance.  At $99- this was  a great deal!

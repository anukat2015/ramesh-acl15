Title: The best!!!
Content:
I love it. I never thought I would enjoy the vacuuming task. It is light weight but so powerful. I have a lot of hardwood floors and the hardwood floor brush works so perfect - it goes everywhere and turns and swivels - and never misses anything. My husband almost had a heart attack when he found out I paid that much - but I am the one who does the cleaning and I insisted on keeping it. You will love it. Wish I bought it long time ago - because if you add up all the worthless vacuums for 150 dollars that I bought and hated after short while, I could have bought 2 Miele vacuums!

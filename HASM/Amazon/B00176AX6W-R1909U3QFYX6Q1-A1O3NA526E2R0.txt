Title: lots of space and good looking
Content:
its a quality mp3 player with awesome headphones. you'll have more than enough space for thousands of songs a bunch of converted videos.there are only a few complaints. the touch button is easy to accidently push while in pocket. you can turn off the touch feature but that detracts from the players coolness and ease to use. also as a warning, do not take snowboarding or i guess any physical activity. if you pay this much make sure to be careful with it. Mine broke and i had to go to a psychiatric ward. jk its a sweet mp3 player buy it if you hate apple and dont want a creative.

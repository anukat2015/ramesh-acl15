Title: Great at the bedside!!!!
Content:
Wish I had this coffee maker years ago.  I have a Senseo single serve coffee maker, which I purchased several years ago.  I have enjoyed it but it has always been a bit messy when disposing of the pod after each use.  That is the reason I have never placed it on the night stand.
The Keurig B60 is residing on my night stand.  It enables me to have a fresh cup of my favorite coffee each work day morning.  Because it only takes a few minutes for it to brew a fresh hot cup of joe while I am trying to wake up each morning, I don't have to stagger into the kitchen and stand there, bleery eyed, waiting for the Senseo to do its job.
No matter where you place the B60, you will always get a fresh, hot cup or mug of your favorite K-Cup coffee in minutes.

Title: Best bet for beginners!!!!
Content:
This camera is great. Although my title suggests this is best bet for beginners, this camera can be great for intermediate to semi-pro photographers with a limited budget.
Pros
- Relatively economic compared to other higher end Canon D-SLRs. Value for money. I purchased:
- This camera (body only)
- a 4 GB CF card
- Canon 200dg Camera bag
- Canon 50mm f1.8 lens
- Extra battery for Canon
All this for a total of $690.
- Excellent resolution pictures with a lot of detail.
- LCD is larger and brighter.
- The 9 point AF is fast, accurate and performs well in low light.
- Settings are very easy to get to. For eg it is very easy and quick to change ISO and AF modes
- Low noise as you go higher up in ISO modes. This is extremely important in low light situations where you want good pictures with less noise.
Cons
- The kit lens is disappointing. I purchased a Tamron 17-50mm instead and am extremely happy with the buy.
- Sporadic shooting after buffer gets full when shooting in continuous mode. You will face this when shooting sport pictures. you have to know after how many shots the buffer gets full in order to not wait between taking pictures. It takes about 15-20 seconds for the camera to get back to normal once the buffer is full.
- Same issue as above when using built-in flash. you will be able to shoot 4-6 pictures without any issue but then the flash will need to recharge and this again takes 15-20 seconds before you can start shooting again.
- No spot metering. Not a big issue for beginners.
- uses CF card. I am not a big fan of CF cards and that is why I put this as a con.
- If there is data in the buffer and you open the CF card compartment, you will lose the data as it shuts off the camera.
Overcall, the camera is great. Even with the Cons, the XTi is Canon's best selling D-SLR camera for the reasons I have listed above. Most important the value for money. One cannot go wrong with this camera.
However, for those enthusiasts who are wanting to get into photography and are looking for a good D-SLR camera, should also look at Rebel XS. This is a model that is between the XTi and the XSi, with features from both the models and improvements from the XTi. It is priced well as well at $699 (less if you are able to find a good deal).
I own the XTi and am extremely happy. This camera is the perfect way to begin photography. It can easily get you to semi-pro level after which you can start looking at other high end cameras. And the best thing is all the lenses you buy for the XTi, work with all Canon cameras (Note: there are exceptions, please make sure the lens you buy will work on Full Frame cameras).

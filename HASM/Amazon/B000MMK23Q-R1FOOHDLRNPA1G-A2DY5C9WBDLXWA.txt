Title: Poorly made/poor support/constantly spammed by mail
Content:
I bought one, it was a waste of money. Mine goes to the high setting by itself it also blows cold air. When I called customer support they told me it couldn't possibly do that!?! They will also expect you to pay shipping to send it back. Within a couple of months it would no longer heat a 12 by 17 foot room. It became very noisy with many rattles and vibrations. One more bad point I get spammed every month with mail to purchase the other lousy products they sell. I replaced this with a much cheaper and better quality oil heater.

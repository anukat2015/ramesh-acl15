Title: Great coffee, poor value
Content:
I agree with a previous reviewer who gave this machine a 3.5. Makes excellent coffee. But way overpriced, especially when a good percentage of the machine is plastic. Coffee temp is not an issue. Believe me. I have a second-degree burn on my hand to prove it. Seriously. But that brings me to the carafe. Poor design on the lid makes pouring very slow.  There is a barely visible dot that is supposed to be lined up with the spout. If you go past the dot at first it only pours slower and if you turn the lid even further, it will fall off, spilling coffee. Hence the burned hand. 
I won't be returning this but if it broke tomorrow I wouldn't buy another one either.
PROS:
Excellent coffee taste.
Easy to use and very legible controls.
Built-in charcoal filter for use of non-filtered water.
Stylish.
Carafe avoids burner-ruined taste.
CONS:
Cost.
Pouring spout.
Non-removable reservoir.

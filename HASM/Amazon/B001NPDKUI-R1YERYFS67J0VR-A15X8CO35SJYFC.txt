Title: Good Little Work horse
Content:
I purchased the computer in Febrary, 2009 and it was used continually by me supporting the Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program(AARP). The machine did not miss a beat and it allowed me to assist well over 200 individuals. Now that tax season is over it is still a joy to use, connecting to the net or processing digital photo.'s. Good job by H/P.

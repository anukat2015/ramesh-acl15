Title: This Vacuum Is The Very Best Very Happy
Content:
First let me say thanks amazon for you fast service.. It only took 1 1/2 day to get here...very fast delivery! Second what the reviews say this vacuum can do! Belive it! This vacuum rocks! It picks up every thing on the rug and floor, there is nothing this vacuum cant find and pick it up. I couldent belive all the dirt it sucked out of my rug. My vacuum that I replaced this one with is not even close to what this awsome vacuum can do! I highly will tell any one to get this vacuum. And for the price I cant belive the little cash I paid for this wonderful machine. It should sell for no less then 500.00 This vacuum is really the best I have ever owned. I let my family use it in there homes and they where saying the same thing I was. They all went to amazon and bought there own. Wow, Wow, Wow what a vacuum. It is very easy to use and it is very easy to clean. I will really baby this machine like I do my corvett. I clean it inside and out, it looks like I just bought it off the show room floor. I am very proud of my machine. Thanks Again For Making This Awsome Vacuum Hoover And Thank You Amazon For Selling This Vacuum On Your Website And The Great Review Pannel You Offer. Wow, Wow, Wow Love this machine! Thanks Again.. I cant say any more about this vacuum, but go and get this. You'll love it!! P.S. It's easy to storage, not a lot of space is needed..

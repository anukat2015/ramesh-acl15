Title: Great for entertaining or just for relaxing evenings
Content:
We've had this drink mixer for 3 years now and it still works great. It has always been a big hit at holiday parties and family get togethers that last long into the night. 
To me, the temperature is just about perfect. No worries about buring your tongue on molten hot chocolate, but it is warm enough to chase the chill out of a cold day. 
We have used instant coffee, lattes, and hot cocoa mixes and all the drinks have come out great. The instant latte mix is extra fun because of the froth feature on the machine, its almost like having a barista in your home. 
First time users should be careful not to overflow the machine! We have filled it just centimeters above the max fill line and sent hot chocolate flying all over the room. 
Cleaning is easy, the spigot screws off for easy rinsing and the base can be wiped clean with a washcloth. Generally, it is not too messy.
The only draw back is that it is a little bulky and therefore difficult for us to store in our smaaaaaal kitchen, but all-in-all I think its worth the space it takes up!

Title: Short-lived -- it's a lemon
Content:
After reading other reviews, I purchased this machine about 18 months ago.  As others mentioned, in the beginning it worked great. Steaming milk for a latte was simple. My real need was a programmable coffeemaker with auto-shutoff. It made great coffee for about a year, needing descaling only twice. Then I noticed that it was not soaking all the grinds, and the descaling warning lit more often. The steamer didn't work, either, and last weekend the coffee side stopped working.  Now I'm left with an expensive,  oversized espresso machine.

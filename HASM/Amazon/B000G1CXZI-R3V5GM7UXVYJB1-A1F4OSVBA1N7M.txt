Title: delonghi heater
Content:
This heater has been great for our toddler's room.  We wanted a heater that has a low profile (that was harder to tip over) that would give even heat.  The timer is great to have, as the room can heat up right before bath time, and at 5 am in the morning without us having to get up.  It gives very adequate heat for a northwest facing bedroom here in the Rockies that is about 120 sq ft.  The only thing we noticed was that when we first fired it up, it did give off a strong oil smell, which has not recurred since the first 2 uses.

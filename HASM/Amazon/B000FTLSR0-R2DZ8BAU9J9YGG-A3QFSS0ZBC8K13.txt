Title: At last, a real camera
Content:
I bought the camera with the kit lens l8-55mm and I love it!
 I really feel I have "arrived" with a real DSLR camera.
 I've been thru a number of point and shoot digital cameras including kodak (2), Nikon(2), Canon A95,Canon S2is.  And also used a canon DSLR D60 ($1200. camera) at work.  I absolutely loved the S2iS which took great pictures, especially in conjunction with Adobe Photoshop with really remarkable results. The Canon D60 was not a good camera in low light, even considering that I did not have great lights. It was also extremely heavy to hold and around the neck.  Even the Nikon 4300 (4MP) worked better than D60 with average studio lights, and took great quality pics.
Back to the k100d.  Easy and fun to use.  Perfect weight and balance.
Amazing sensor stabilization (every bit as good as S2is,and probably better stabilization). I plan to buy one or two used Pentax lenses although the l8-55 mm is excellent all around. Picture quality: I couldn't believe the great low-light performance! I took shots at 1/10th of a second at iso 800, in my living room, with no flash, that are better than any indoor shots I ever took even with a flash. The noise is practically non-existent up to iso 800. When the family is around and I'm taking snapshots I use the onboard flash along with a handheld slave (Phoenix) flash that helps keep the lighting absolutely natural looking and works great under different conditions (like with no lamps on).  My outdoor shots were easy and wonderful.  If over-saturated I can easily tone down the colors in Photoshop.  I wish there was a way to adjust color saturation in automatic but it doesn't seem doable.  Maybe I'll try in Program mode.  If anyone is shopping for a dslr I highly recommend this one, an absolute bargain, with built-in image stabilization. Anyone can use this camera and get professional results.

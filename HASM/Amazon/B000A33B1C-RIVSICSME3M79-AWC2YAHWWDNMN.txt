Title: Oil filled radiator
Content:
These heaters work great!  I have an in law apartment (900 sq. ft.) that I converted to oil heat 3 years ago from electric heat. This being 2008 and oil being at $4.00 a gallon, I considered to "convert" back to electric. I purchased 4 of these radiators and showed my mother in law how to use them.  She puts them on level one at 1/3 the way on the heat switch and her apartment is warm within 15 minutes.  She has her regular oil heat thermostat set on 55 degrees and uses these as a main heat source. It's a shame that oil heat is now more expensive than electric heat, but I am glad that she can now "switch" between each energy source and I get to choose which one is cheaper seeing I pay the bill.

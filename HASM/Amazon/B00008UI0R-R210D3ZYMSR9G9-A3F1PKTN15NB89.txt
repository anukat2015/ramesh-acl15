Title: Nice Vacuum!
Content:
This is the first canister vacuum I have ever owned and I have to say it works for my needs. I have mostly slate floors and area rugs so the carpet to floor option is great. The attachments are nice and most of all I love how the dirt gets trapped in a well designed canister. The only reason I gave it four stars is that I wish the cord was longer! If it were just a couple feet longer it would have been perfect!

Title: Could be great but  poor build quality
Content:
My Daughter loves her Mix Max and I must admit that I had some fun with it trying to encode different videos.  Unfortunately the build quality is lacking.  After less than 20 hours of use, the play button and the MixIt button stopped working.  Plugging in a video will play, but without a working play pause/button this device is pretty unusable.  Unfortunately, before the play/pause button broke I bought I second one for my son for XMas.  I'm now regretting that purchase.

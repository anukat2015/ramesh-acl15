Title: excellent safe heater
Content:
We purchased this heater last winter to save on home heating costs. It has performed admirably. I was so pleased with it that I bought another one for my son's dormitory room in his school. It's easy to operate and the thermostat setting ensures that you don't overheat the room. Just remember to follow the instructions and be sure to unplug from the wall before leaving your home as the manufaturer says.

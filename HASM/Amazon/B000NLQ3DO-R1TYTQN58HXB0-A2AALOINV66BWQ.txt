Title: Great Coffee! Nice price!
Content:
Unlike some other reviewers, I've never had a problem with my unit.  I did have an overflow problem one day, but then realized that I'd left the top off the carafe.  Without the top, the coffee stays in the filter area and doesn't flow through.  I've never had grounds in my water tank or in my coffee.  I use the gold filter that came with my unit, as well as a paper filter.. simply for easy cleanup (and for saving the grounds for my outdoor plants).  I've only had to use the clean feature a few times in the 18 months that I've had it. I fill the water tank up to the 12 cup mark, and I get 12 cups every time.  I use 4 "coffee scoops" of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I get perfect results.   
I love that it has a switch to make the coffee hotter, and find that even after the 2 hour cut off, I can still get a hot cup of coffee for at least another hour.  Maybe the other reviewer likes the coffee so hot that it burns their mouth, but I do not.  I hate having to wait to enjoy my java. 
The only thing I don't like about the unit is that the chime is really loud.  It's no problem since you can turn it off!

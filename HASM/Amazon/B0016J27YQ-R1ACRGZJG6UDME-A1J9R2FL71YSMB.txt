Title: Provides no cooling
Content:
I bought this item to provide some cooling in a single, small room. In my area when it is hot it is dry, so a swamp cooler should be at least somewhat effective. I tried this on two days that reached about 90 degrees with humidity levels below 30%. It had utterly no effect on the temperature in the room. Since the recommendation is to have some ventilation while using a swamp cooler, I tried it first with a door open for ventilation. That didn't work, so I tried it with the door closed. I tried it with cold water and I tried adding ice in the ice compartment. I tried it on all three speeds. It did not lower the temperature in the room even a degree. I was so puzzled by its ineffectiveness I even opened the back and inspected the mechanism to ensure that the unit I received was functioning correctly. It apparently was: the wick that the air blows through was damp. You would think it would provide at least a little relief, but no dice. The only benefit it offered was a very slight cooling sensation when you stand directly in the airflow. But not more than a fan alone. And no general cooling in the room. I don't fully understand why it was so ineffective, but it was. On the upside, the vendor, Air-N-Water, delivered it quickly, for free, and the box arrived in good shape.

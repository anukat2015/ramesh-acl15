Title: Great laptop for entertainment
Content:
I have had this laptop for a week and really like it for my uses.I do not play games but other than that it is a overall great laptop for net surfing, watching dvds and other media uses.I loaded itunes and put 5 cds on my harddrive relatively easy.It only ran at 8.5x speed at the max so putting alot of cds on this will take awhile.One of the drawbacks with the DVD player is that it says you can only switch regions 5 times so I won't be watching my PAL dvds I have on this machine,Set-up was a breeze and this is my first wireless computer.It found my neighbors networks at a resonable strenght to about 100 feet away so in any size house you should be able to use it anywhere.My network set-up and use is petty easy but I might be getting some interfernce with a wireless phone because I have to be within 15 feet or so to upload photos without losing the signal.The bottom of this does not get hot at all so you can put it in you lap and couch surf easily.The scroll feature on the touch pad is easy to use and the keyborad is comfortable enough to use and loaded photos was asnap also.The battery life is not that great so you might want to buy an extra battery if you are using this while flying of long car trips.I given it a 4 star review but if I where rating it on what I paid for it($599) I give it 5 stars.The screen is great and the HD videos on youtube look as good as HD TV but this machine does not have a blu-ray player so you are dependent on Netflix or blockbuster if you want a HD true experience.the screen adjusts the image to the type of movie you put in so a widescreeen movie fills up the screen while non-widescreens are s adjusted to get the most of the picture.Another very cool feature fromHP is the mediasmart program,it has links to snapfish and youtube which make using these sites very easy.

Title: what a piece of crap!!!!!
Content:
I brought this, this paper weight thinking that I would be able to surf the web with "limitless" but all I got was whole lotta head scratches and frustration.  Can't even view Youtube and Yahoo!  websites with flash images won't show because Archos does not have the latest Flash player installed(and this problem has been recognized since early 2008 and Archos still has not corrected it).  Battery life in this is the worst I have ever encountered in any electronic device.  Crashes and freezes a lot, makes all kinds of noises, and heavy for a portable device.  This does not support all videos but some, and the image quality is so so.  Connection to internet drops when left idol for more than five minutes, and yes I tried adjusting it and it still won't fix the problem. 
My problem was, I should have checked the "Archos Beaware Forum" before buying this product.  I rushed into buying this paper weight because I was excited after watching the video clips on Youtube and the price it was on for sale.  But soon I found out it was too good to be true.

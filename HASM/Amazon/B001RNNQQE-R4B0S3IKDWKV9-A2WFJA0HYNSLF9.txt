Title: Great coffee!
Content:
We were replacing a Krups coffeemaker and knew that we preferred the type with a thermal carafe. I'm very sensitive to burned coffee taste and find that a thermal carafe eliminates that problem. We do like a strong coffee, and with some tweaking, have found this coffeemaker delivers a great pot of coffee. We found that we need to increase the amount used from what Cuisinart recommends to about half again as much as they recommend. In other words, we use 1-1/2 scoops of the provided scoop per cup of coffee. The other big test for us with coffeemakers is how long they keep the coffee hot. Again, this coffeemaker delivers. Three hours later, the coffee is still hot enough that it doesn't require reheating (unless you like your coffee scorching hot). The system cleans easily. We pop all the parts into the dishwasher. Having the gold-colored filter is another great asset. Overall, a very satisfying purchase.

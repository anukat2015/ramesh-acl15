Title: Dell Inspiron laptop
Content:
I recently upgraded from a Dell Inspiron 1525 to this 1750 model. 
The differences....
I defiantly like the BIGGER screen. (getting older I guess) The Volume control / speaker improvement with greater volume capacity is totally awesome. I was pleasantly surprised by the weight of this unit being so much bigger....it doesn't feel much heavier then the last one I had OR I am simply comfortable with the weight of this one. Also, the hinged portion of the unit &lt;where the screen opens / lifts> is a HUGE improvement. The previous generations were cheap and actually pinched the wires that run through the hinge causing haze on the screen. This unit scores a TREMENDOUS improvement in this department from me. 
On the flip side....
Dell still hasn't figured out how nice it would be for the cord (AC adapter) to be located in the back rather then the side. An improvement in that department would be nice but not critical to my daily use. I utilize the lap as little as possible and love the versatility of a carry along. Also, the keys on this unit are much different which I have found very difficult to adjust to. The previous lap tops I have had came with a beveled/raised keys whereas this unit is all flat. I am not a typist - I peck the keys with my index fingers and these keys seem to cause me fits....more errors. I never knew there was an option or difference in the keys but will certainly pay attention next time around. 
Over all....I give this new model 4 out of 5 stars....there still is room for improvement.

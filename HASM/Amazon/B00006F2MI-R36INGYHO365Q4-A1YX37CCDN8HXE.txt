Title: I have No Complaints
Content:
I bought my Grind & Brew factory refurbished.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the coffeemaker.  It has leaked.  The secret is to assemble all the parts BEFORE setting the carafe in place.  No more leaks. The lid leaks when you get to the bottom of the carafe.  I take off the lid at that point, and continue pouring with no problem.  I don't have a problem with cleaning.  I use a bottle brush to clean out the grinding spout.  I run a cloth over the inside after brewing.  I don't find that troublesome.  The coffee tastes great!  I love the timer, and never thought anything about any noise the grinder makes.  What's the big deal?? I never expected a silent grinder. I had guests that were so impressed, they are going to get one, too.  To each his own.

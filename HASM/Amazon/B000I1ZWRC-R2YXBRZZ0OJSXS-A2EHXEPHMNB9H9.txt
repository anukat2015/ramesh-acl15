Title: Good to go
Content:
This camera has everything that you need, has been easy to learn how to use (it's my first digital camera), and takes great pictures.  It's been a lot of fun to play around with.  I'm especially interested in low light photography, and have been very impressed with the sharpness and quality of the images even without a tripod.  I generally like to set most everything manually, and it's been easy to work with in that regard.  Many of the auto features are good enough that it's been slowly tempting me to become more lazy.
Also, the software package that comes with the camera has been easy to use.  It makes handling the much larger number of pictures I take now (vs. my old Canon AE-1) a lot easier than I thought it would be.  
If you're looking for a capable SLR camera at a good value, I would definitely recommend this one.

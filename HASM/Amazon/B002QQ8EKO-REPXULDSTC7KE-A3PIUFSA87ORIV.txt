Title: Well worth the price
Content:
When I began asking for a MacBook for Christmas, my parents were very skeptical of buying me a new computer that is a thousand dollars. After much campaigning and convincing, I finally convinced them. After a few days, I was completely adjusted to the system coming from using Windows my whole life. I find the Mac system more efficient, easier to use, more advanced, and overall completely amazing. Some of my favorite features include the incredible trackpad, expose, photobooth, the face recognition feature on iPhoto, the easy to use dock, and of course iChat. 
If you are looking for an easy to use computer that has lots of useful features and an amazing battery life, this computer is for you. In conclusion, my MacBook is one of my most prized possessions and well worth the price.

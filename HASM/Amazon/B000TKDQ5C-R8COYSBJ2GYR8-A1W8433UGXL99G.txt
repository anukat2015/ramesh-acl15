Title: great for small office
Content:
Just got this to use at work, I work in a warehouse with only one large vent pumping out heat in one direction only and it is not near my desk. I use this on the floor under my desk and a fellow college's desk and it works great. It keeps our legs and body warm and toasty. It's not to loud at all and takes up little space. I wouldn't recommend it for a large area as once you walk a few feet away you can't feel the heat any more but great for small office, bathroom or to use in addition to poor central heat.

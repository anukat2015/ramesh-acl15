Title: Lasko Ceramic Heater
Content:
This is a good product, even tho it's a little breezy; just don't sit in the airflow path & its very good to heat a room. I like the adjustable feature that keeps the output close to the floor. I bought this from Amazon & it was defective; I went to their return site & got a prepaid shipping label plus they got me a replacement the next day! Beat that Walmart!!

Title: best portable laptop ive ever owned
Content:
I like the size of most netbooks, but the power of them leaves alot to be desired.  I came across this netbook (actually, its classsified as a notebook) and thought i would give it a try.  The battery life is fantastic, as i have yet to get less than 6 hours of battery life (but usually closer to 7-8).  the 11.6 inch screen makes a huge difference from a 10.1.  Many of my coworkers have netbooks, and cant compete with this.  Its a laptop in a netbooks clothing.  The HD screen is bright, and i mean BRIGHT!  I usually keep it at 75% of its max, unless im outside.  If the screen is in direct sunlight, you wont be able to see anything, but aside from that, it works excellent outside....even on a bright day.  I love the 4 gigs of 800mhz ram, and core2duo centrino inside.  Makes computing quick.  This wasnt purchased for any kind of gaming, but decided to try civilization 4 on it.  Actually works very well, very playable.  Im a 6'4" guy, and even though this is a smal computer, its not too small for my hands.  I hooked up the hdmi to my 52" hdtv, and was impressed by the quality/clarity on screen.  streaming movies is flawless.  Ive heard some reviews that didnt like the touchpad, but i like it alot.  Ive had this for about a month now, and the only thing that would make this better, would be a backlit keyboard.  But no biggie.

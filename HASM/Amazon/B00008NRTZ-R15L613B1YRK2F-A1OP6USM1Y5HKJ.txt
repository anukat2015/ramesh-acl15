Title: Loving it so far....
Content:
I have had this vacuum for a few weeks now and I was so impressed with its features that I felt I should chime in on these reviews.  First of all, I have not experienced any problems with the hoses, like others have mentioned.  This vacuum has worked well on my wall-to-wall carpeting and even on a flimsy area rug in my daughter's room that my Hoover upright always ate.  I haven't been able to get it to clean dust off of my hardwood as much as I'd like, but I prefer to mop that up anyway.
This is what I think sets the vacuum apart from the others I've tried, including my Hoover Windtunnel:
*Onboard attachments that don't fall off when you vacuum: they are stored inside the canister
*Ease of use on stairs: I have a split-level house with short staircases, so I don't have to carry the canister
*Retractible cord: You can just step on the cord button on the canister and the cord will disappear.  I always hated having to wrap up the cord on my upright.
*Easy storage: because the canister separates easily from the brush part, I can fit it on the floor of my tiny linen closet, under the bottom shelf
I would definitely recommend this model for someone looking for a mid-priced canister.

Title: Dead on arrival
Content:
Was interested in this little jem as a travel book.. Unfortunately it was dead out of the box. Plugged it in, turned it on, hard drive light never lit up and screen stayed dark. Tried to turn it off, and would the lights would not go out.  Staples had it on sale for $[...] with rebates. but wanted another couple hundred for 3 year warranty. I have had HP computers for many years, and seem to have had several that were buggy when the early batches come out. I understand that this one was released in April, so maybe that is the issue. 
I took it back, and did not replace it with another. Will wait till it has bee tried and tested for a while. I know some will say that I can't rate the whole barrel of apples on just trying one. But, would you want to buy a car from a manufacture if you found out the one you just bought had no engine??  
Get to work HP and test them a bit better. This one had a good weight, but the top sure felt thin even for plastic. Coming with a separate disk reader/writer looked useful for installing files and programs. If the size is what you want, but much heavier, try the HP Tablet. Bought my son one for his engineering class at Purdue and he loves it. I am sure that Amazon sells that one too.

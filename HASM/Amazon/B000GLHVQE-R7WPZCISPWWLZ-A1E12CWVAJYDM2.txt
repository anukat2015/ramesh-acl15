Title: great lil stove
Content:
I bought this because of the reviews. It came fast and it is just adorable. I have a small cottage type home 1000 sq ft, with high ceilings and the heater in the attic, which does a lousy job getting the warmth down to the floor/living area. It seems like I am paying to heat the roof. It is a newer home and supposedly energy efficient, but sometimes it is warmer outside my home than inside, which I find highly annoying. The little stove does great in our kitchen, living room, dinning room area. It takes the chill off quickly. I did replace the 7 watt bulb with the one mentioned in the first review and it runs great....the flames do give the illusion of real...almost. I would rate it 5 stars if it had a thermostat. It only has lo/hi buttons. Am considering getting the plug in thermostat mentioned also in the first review.

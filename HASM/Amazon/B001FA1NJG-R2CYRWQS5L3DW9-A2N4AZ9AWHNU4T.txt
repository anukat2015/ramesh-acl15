Title: Love it
Content:
got this as an upgrade from my dieing ipod video 5th gen.
just amazing.
wireless syncing is great,be able to sync podcast from my room with no wires are great.
the screen is beautiful very bright.
being able to change the background a small thing is great.
not having to install any 3rd party stuff to do that is great.
battery  life is pretty good too.
i love the all black front and back is such a awesome touch.
very under rated mp3 player,i will go as far to say its better then an ipod.
1 flaw,the lack of cases is such a pain.

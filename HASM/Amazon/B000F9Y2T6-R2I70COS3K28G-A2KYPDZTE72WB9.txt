Title: Love that Flip-It!
Content:
I love my new Flip-It for cleaning hardwood floors. The heat option really helps get out ground-in dirt and makes the floor dry faster too. I have read reviews that the Flip-It leaves small puddles of water. I found this to be true on eneven surfaces of older floors, but not on smooth newly installed floors, so I think it's more a matter of the floor surface. Also, pumping out a little less cleaner onto wood floors keeps puddles away. It also works well on vinyl tile floors. I have not tried the dry vacuum mode yet. If you have a lot of hardwood floors this is a real time-saver.

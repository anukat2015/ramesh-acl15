Title: Great little ipod!
Content:
I purchased this to make my life a little simpler and not have to carry around CD's anymore. This definitely does it's job!! It's so cute and tiny! It's so easy to carry it in your purse or pocket! The only thing that is disappointing is compared to my husband's ipod classic, the sound quality isn't so good. But if I counldn't compare and know a difference, it would be fine! I just have to turn up my stereo a lot more when it's plugged into my car.

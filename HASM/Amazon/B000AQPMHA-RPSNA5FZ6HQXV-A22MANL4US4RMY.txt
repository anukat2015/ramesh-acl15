Title: No Complaints
Content:
I've had the B40 for almost a year, and it continues to make great coffee, tea, and wonderful Hot Cocoa.  I think it's funny that they call it Hot Cocoa.  It's usually either Hot Chocolate or Cocoa.  Anyway, I have no complaints at all.
Yes, it does make some noise and vibrate, but it's nothing to be concerned about.  I'm surprised some people found that objectionable.  it's just the sound of the pump sending the water from here to there.
I also bought the little cup that you can fill yourself with whatever coffee or tea you want.  That works fine, too.
You see these things in all sorts of public places, from supermarkets to doctor's offices.  That's what made me decide to get one.

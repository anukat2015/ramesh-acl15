Title: Waste of $
Content:
This heater blew a fuse twice in my office, causing my coworkers' computers to shut down and lose unsaved information.  The darn thing comes on for 2 seconds every 5 minutes so I'm constantly cold.  I would recommend one where you can change the fan setting to go at all times on low without the thermostat stepping in and ruining a good warmth.  Also, doesn't turn off unless you unplug it so I have to crawl under my desk everytime I leave the office.  No fun.  Want to return but it's too much of a hassle.

Title: Does what it advertised
Content:
I really bought the Wet/Dry vac just for small things like leaves, crumbs, fur, stuff that always seems to wind up in my car but aren't major disasters.  I love the vacuum; although I haven't tried to vacuum up any liquid I know it works great on the small stuff.  Would definitely recommend, a little bigger than I thought so I keep it in the garage rather then in the car but still very convenient.

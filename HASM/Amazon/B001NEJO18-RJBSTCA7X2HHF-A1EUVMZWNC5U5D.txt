Title: Excellent choice for the price
Content:
Good:	 Price - bought it from Office Depot for $499.  Fast enough, not for gamers, though.   Very, very quiet.  Easy to use, good memory and HD size,  CPU for the price.  Full size keypad.  Outstanding quality of the screen.    Excellent replacement for desktop.  
Cons:	Weight, battery life, portable enough to move it @ home, however, not for frequent fliers. 
Overall, strongly recommended for quality vs the price.

Title: Fresh Coffee, Great Sleek Look, I Love this Coffee Maker!
Content:
The best looking Keurig by far. I love how the blue light glows in the kitchen. Sleek, Modern look with easy clean up and ease of use as well. It's also easy to clean!
 
I read the other review about the coffee sometimes being weak with larger brew sizes. I use the second to the largest and the largest brew size, so I switched to bolder coffee flavors/darker roasts, like the Sumatra and Dark Magic. (When I prefer medium roasts, I just use the smaller brew size) The coffee is great, and there is a great variety of flavors. If you go on the Keurig site, there are a large assortment of teas and variety coffee packs as well, but the prices here on Amazon are the best, but there is a limited selection. 
 
When people come over, its so much easier than making a huge pot of one flavor of coffee for everyone. My friends and family love using it too! I would definitely recommend this to everyone!

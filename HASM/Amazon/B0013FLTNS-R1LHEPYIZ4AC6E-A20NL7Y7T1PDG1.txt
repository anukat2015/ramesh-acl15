Title: A good compromise between portability and power
Content:
A current iMac or Mac Pro would have been a faster computer, but the price was right and, for a portable, I'm impressed with the MacBook Pro's capabilities. The most taxing things I use this computer for are World of Warcraft, video chat, and development work using Eclipse.
Most of the time, I use this in a stationary environment, and have added an Apple (wired) external keyboard and a 2-button Kensington mouse. The laptop touchpad and keyboard are actually not bad to type on, but a full-size keyboard and mouse better suit me.
Pros:
- availability of a matte screen (option no longer available on current MacBook pros)
- discrete video card (GPU) does a better job handling graphics-intense video games.
- backlit keyboard is a nice bonus, even if you do touch type.
- 15" widescreen display seems larger than I thought it would be.
- standard DVI output, not a proprietary plug.
Cons:
- if you tax the GPU, you can burn through the battery charge in an hour or two.
- the bottom of the computer can get very warm, but I believe that's common in laptop form factors.

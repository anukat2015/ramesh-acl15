Title: Video Card problem
Content:
It happens virtually to all dv9700t owners.
There is a overheating problem with video card on the computer.  My  Pavilion went dead right after warranty expired. 
HP tech support asks 430$ to fix it. HP will not admit that this product is defective. I will not recommend buying this product to anyone.

Title: don't buy one of these
Content:
I also like a previous reviewer bought a FTXSS43-2 at Walmart.  In a little over a year I have bought 4 gallons of vinegar to clean it repetitively.  The pot leaked from day one.  I am moving on to something else with better reviews.  I wish I would have read some of the Mr coffee reviews on amazon before deciding what to buy.  Buyer beware.

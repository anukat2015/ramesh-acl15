Title: The best camera for this amazing price
Content:
The Rebel XS is a very well built camera, easy to use, with all the features that I need in a camera. The EF-S 18-55mm lens is a wide angle lens and works very well. This camera takes 3 frames per second great for any kind of event. The Canon Rebel XSi which is a more expensive camera has more megapixels and a wider screen that's all. For the money saved the Rebel XS is a winner. I have researched all the DSLR cameras on the market and this one is truly the best for the price. The minute I opened the box I knew I had a winner.

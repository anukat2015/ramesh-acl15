Title: overall a good player
Content:
this player beats the ipod strait up. the scroll bar on the player is so much better than the click wheel on an ipod. the screen resolution is AUSOME. the pictures, song titles, etc. all look really good and clear.the sound quality is good with the original 32 different eqs. then you have your custom equalizer. the 8000 songs are plenty for me and anyone else i know, and can be sorted and a few different ways, titles, artists, genres, and albums. 
now when you talk about digital electronics you have to talk about the disadvantages right?. if you buy this device i strongly recomend that you buy the mistic audio leather case for it. although it is $25 it is well worth it. the original case it comes with is ugly, hard to put the player in and to take it out of, it is also hard to feel the play, next, and previous track buttons becaise the silicone covers them. also the original case does not cover the screen leaving it open to scratches. if you have an older computer you will have to run a windows update for service pack one, with dial up this took me 235 minutes. the charger is a universal charger/ usb cable so it has a plug in to the wall and a usb. this can be a pain because while charging it there will be another cable to get tangled in whatever. but overall i would recomend buying this device over an ipod.

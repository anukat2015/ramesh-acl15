Title: Total Scam Total Bait and Switch - Techno Intelligence
Content:
I want everyone to be on the look for this issue. This company is stating that they have (2) of these units when they do NOT. The company is taking your money for a TX2500Z but they are sending you a tx2-1370 which cost around $500 less. I spoke to a representative myself and was told they don't have the model but this item is still being advertised as being in stock as of 02-08-2010 which is totally false and misleading. I returned the item last week and was told I would receive a refund but as of today nothing has happen. The company which is providing this scam is Techno Intelligence just type in tx2500z and you will see that they are claiming to have the item but when you order it they will send you another notebook entirely. I just want to inform everyone of this matter but luckily they performed this act on someone which operates on the right side of the law and handles this type of issue on a national front.
I ordered a TX2500Z but I was sent the tx2-1370 notebook which HP verified as well. I just got the system on Friday so hopefully this issues will be fixed by early next week. Be careful and make sure you get what you pay for.

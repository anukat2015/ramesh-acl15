Title: Disposable? vacuum
Content:
I would have written a completely different review right after first using the Hoover Windtunnel.  Fabulous!  Amazing! etc.  But after the 10th use or so, the carpet attachment STOPPED WORKING.  I took it to get repaired (this was two months into owning it - it sat idle for a while as I suffered through using my old vacuum).  They replaced the belt and charged me for it - something about the belt not being under warranty.  The belt has been slipping ever since and after repositioning it for the zillionth time, I've had it.  It has never worked well after breaking down the first time at one month old.

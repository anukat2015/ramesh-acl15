Title: Apple continues to deliver
Content:
I waited a couple of months before reviewing so I could put the 8GB Nano through its paces.  It has performed flawlessly.  Like all previous IPODs and Nano's, the user interface, navigation, and ITunes integration are superb and worth any extra money you might pay for this product.  The sound quality is excellent moving between songs seemlessly, but the earbuds do not give it justice so I prefer to listen with lighweight headphones.  The screen's detail is great and it is so bright you could use it in a pinch as a flash light.  And finally the battery life as advertised is much improved.  I can go days and days without recharging.  I'm sure the next generation will have more memory for less money but 8GB provides a lot of listening pleasure.

Title: Perfect camera for DSLR beginner
Content:
Before I purchased this camera I had read lots of reviews on other DSLR cameras in the $500 price bracket. On the day of purchasing the A200 I had actually chosen the Pentax K200D as the reviews for that camera were slightly more positive. However if you're like me then you'll want the biggest bang for your buck and since Amazon is selling the A200 with both the kit 70mm lens and the 300mm lens for only $549 this to me was absolutely the best offer. 
First of all the build on this camera is pretty solid. Some reviews said it was too plasticky but I think it's a pretty solid unit. The kits lens don't have that nice solid, rubbery grip like more expensive lenses but for starting out they are absolutely fine. Some other reviews said the images produced by the kit lens are a little on the soft side, but I thought they were pretty darn sharp. 
If you are new to DSLR like me and stepping up from a regular point & shoot camera or 35mm SLR camera then this is absolutely a good choice. The camera body itself has enough features to keep you busy and experimenting such as using Aperture and Shutter priority (I'm too afraid to try manual mode just yet!) and it will give you plenty of opportunity to upgrade to better lenses in the future as your expertise grows.
Overall this is a great camera that produces beautiful images. The kit lenses are good enough to last you through your familiarity with the camera and the body packs enough features that will only produce even better pictures as you add better lenses in the future.

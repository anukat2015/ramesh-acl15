Title: Good Starter D-SLR
Content:
This was my first digital SLR camera. It's easy to use and understand, would highly recommend it for beginners. It's also good for those who are interesting in photography as a fine art, but not expecting to go pro. It worth the cost and can be expanded with alot of available lenses. I was once told that "it's not the camera that makes a good photo but the person holding it".

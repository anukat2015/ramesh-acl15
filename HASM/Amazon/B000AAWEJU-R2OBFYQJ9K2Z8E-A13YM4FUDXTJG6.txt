Title: Great Vacuum Cleaner for a house with ALL Bare Floors!
Content:
This vacuum cleaner is an excellent vacuum if your home has all bare floors.  The attachments that come with the vacuum are only designed to work with either wood floors, tile floors, or linoleum floors.  You will be very disapointed if you buy this vacuum thinking it will clean carpets.  If you have just a few oriental rugs and minimal carpeting, you might consider going for the Miele Antares.  
If you have all bare floors, you will love the Miele Carina for years to come.  There durability are the best in the industry.  Customers tell me that you can even listen to music when you are vacuuming, it's that quiet!

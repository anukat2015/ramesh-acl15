Content:
I wish I had never ordered this coffeemaker.  I love my old Bunn coffee makers and won't order any other brand...but it will NEVER be the thermo kind again.  The coffee gets cold fast, and as there is no plate heater it's not for us.  If you don't drink the whole pot in the first 10 minutes you have to heat your coffee in the microwave.  The carafe leaks.  ALSO, you can't tell if there is coffee in the pot or not...I really miss my old-style Bunn!

Title: filter tray swings open
Content:
I am not loving this coffeemaker. While I don't have trouble with the taste, the bubbles make it hard to tell how many cups you are brewing, the coffee does not keep the temperature very long, and it is difficult to pour. Also, and it might just be mine, but the coffee filter tray swings open and lets steam out when it is nearly done finished brewing. Is it supposed to do that??

Title: Very good heater
Content:
My office at work has no heat - literally and because the walls are brick, I feel like I'm in a meat locker during the winters.  I purchased this heater with the intention of heating up the entire office; however, I find that unless the heater is directly facing me, and in close proximity, it doesn't do much.  Unfortunately, I find that after a short while of hot air blowing directly on me, it becomes uncomfortable and I need to move it further away from me.  When I do that, I very quickly get cold again, so it is a never ending cycle.  Otherwise, it works great.

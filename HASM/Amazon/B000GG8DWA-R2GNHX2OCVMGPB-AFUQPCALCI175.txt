Title: Ordering a 2nd one
Content:
I bought this heater because I needed to provide heat for myself in a drafty environment. I was not interested in heating the room; just myself. For using only 800 watts of electricity, this heater produces a tremendous amount of heat. No fan noise; no air blowing; just heat right where you aim it. I have found that after I get warmed up, adequate heat is provided by the half-power (400 watt) setting. I am very pleased. My wife was so impressed by this heater that I had to order one for her also. And even with both of them going, the total engergy use will be the same or less than other (1500 watt) forced air space heaters.

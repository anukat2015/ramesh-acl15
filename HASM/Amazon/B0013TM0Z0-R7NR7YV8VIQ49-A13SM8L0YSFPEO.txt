Content:
This is a great fill in if your heater core sprung a leak and you don't want to replace it.    It worked great in my extended cab pick up.  It will take the chill off, but your not going to roast.   The only complaint is that the bracket is really cheesy and it could break very easy.  It should have a metal braket like a CB radio with screws at each end.

Title: Great Value with Great Results
Content:
Love this camera.  A super value and you don't all you have to do is point and shoot to take great pictures.  Of course there are excellent DSLR features to take advantage of, but you don't have to learn it all right away to get excellent results.
I chose this over the Nikon D60 and Canon Rebel Xti because of the antishake technology and longer battery life and have not regretted it.  The only advantage that I see with the Nikon and the Canon is that they are the top sellers and there are a few more accessories available.
Minolta AF lenses fit this camera.  (check for specific details) but I got one and works great.
Would definetly recommend this camera.

Title: Good at first, but...
Content:
We purchased at the beginning of the year because the forced air heater we were using in our bedroom left me with headaches and a bloody nose and I was worried the same would happen to our newborn.
Upon reading the good reviews of this unit I purchased it and it worked great for the rest of the winter and chilly spring nights.  I constantly had to turn the unit down because it was really warming up the bedroom.
But I just pulled it out for use about a month ago and it has failed to perform.  I leave it on high all night and it still does not warm up the room.  I have to run the other space heater along with it to warm up the room, then turn off the other heater before it gives me a headache.  This goes on several times during the night.
I wanted to return it since it is still under warranty but DeLonghi says I have to pay for shipping it!  This was a good heater, but it would be nice if it lasted longer then 11 months.

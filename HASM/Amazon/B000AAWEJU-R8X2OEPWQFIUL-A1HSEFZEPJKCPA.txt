Title: Perfect vacuum cleaner for small apartment overrun by cat fur or other similar things
Content:
This baby assembles in 2 minutes so you'll be vacuuming in no time.  The user manual is clear and concise.  The vacuum is lightweight and easy to move.  The 4 attachments - floor, upholstery/curtains, crevice, dust - are well-built and sufficient for most homes.  It's very quiet - so quiet that my cat didn't run from the room!  It picked up everything:
Kitty litter in the carpet - check.
Cat fur on the microsuede sofa - check.
Hardwood floors in the corner of the room - check.
Plus, it's absolutely adorable.  I've used several vacuum cleaners before, including a Dyson, and this one's my favorite.  Cleaning was so fast, I'm looking forward to next time.  I don't know if this is typical, but I received it the day after I ordered it!

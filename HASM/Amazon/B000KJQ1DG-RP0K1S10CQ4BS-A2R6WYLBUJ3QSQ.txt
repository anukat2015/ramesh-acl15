Title: Love this purchase!
Content:
when I got this purchase, I took it to anywhere with me to take pictures of many things immediately.. First thing I was awakard with nikon technical becuase i did not used to this brand.  I am huge fan of Canon brand things, so I used to this.. But I still (in progress) learn how to use nikon d40, it is good for me as beginner and help me getting more experience with this before buying expensive dslr camera..  Overall, I like this purchase, and I am happy it is worth my money for this..  P.S. I want to buy extra lens to get better closer pitures. :)

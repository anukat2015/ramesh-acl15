Title: Piece of Crap
Content:
This is the worst coffee maker to come along in quite a while.  Segments of the LED display have gone out so that you can't read what it says -after only a year.  The water level indicator doesn't work because it fills with bubbles and you never know which one is showing you what.  The carafe leaks if you use it to fill the machine.  The machine leaks when it makes coffee.  And the basket holder has a nasty way of un-latching when you remove the carafe.  Cleaning is a nasty chore.  It's hard to believe this model is still being sold.

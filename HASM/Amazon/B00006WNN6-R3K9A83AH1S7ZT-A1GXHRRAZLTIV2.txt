Title: Why spend $40 or more when you can spend $15
Content:
This heater is just great. Although difficult to see the number settings on the thermostat dial, the heater is surprisingly powerful for something so small. We are doing work on our house and do not have good insulation right now. The furnace could only keep the house to 55 degrees, but the rooms with these had no problem at 70 or so. And they did not run continuously either. Some heaters with cheaper thermostats contstantly cycle on and off, but this one will stay off for a while and then stay on for a while, just like your whole house thermostat. The only negative is that there is no shut off switch if it falls over and I do not trust it to shut down on its own otherwise.

Title: cat owner verdict: great on floors, bad on carpets
Content:
this thing works amazingly well on hard wood floors - even gets cat litter from in between planks!  the attachment for upholestry is terrific too - pulls all the dust and cat hair right off!
BUT it is not good on any carpets at all!
I have three: a cotton rag rug, a thin shag, and a regular dorm-style rug and it's not good on any of them.  pulls the area rug up off the floor but doesn't get much off the rug!  
rug owners be warned.  if it's just floors and furniture, go for it!

Title: What happened to the design?
Content:
This unit looks extrememly well made, like other Mr. Heater products. But unlike their tiny portable units there is NO WAY to turn down the heat. 125000 BTUs is a LOT of heat, enough for nearly 3000 square feet. But it consumes nearly 5.5 gallons of propane per hour to do so. That would be OK for really cold conditions. But it is all or nothing. There is no thermostat or , as previously stated, way to turn down to a lower heat setting. I found a similar unit at Grainger that has three heat settings, (50/95/125,000 BtuH Output) and is priced the same, so I am sending this one back.

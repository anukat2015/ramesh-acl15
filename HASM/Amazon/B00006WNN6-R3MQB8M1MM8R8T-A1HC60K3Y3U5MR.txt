Title: Shuts Down On High Heat
Content:
The quiet low volume fan moves air even more gently when extra line electricity is drawn on the high heat setting and in no time instead of a warmer bathroom the safety feature shuts down the entire unit. I checked -- this is not the thermostat, even fan only will not function. Obviously the weak fan allows the higher heat setting to warm the unit itself enough trigger the safety shut down. I think this is a design flaw not an actual safety hazard. I am about to return this to Amazon and have already purchased from Amazon the DeLonghi DCH1030 which is excellent. Both fans by the way aim the hot air up sufficiently to not heat at all the surface on which they are placed -- unlike a Holmes unit I used many years but placed on a hotplate for safety.

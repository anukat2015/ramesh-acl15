Title: My First Apple Product
Content:
It was the end of last summer when I learned I was getting this. Since I was gonna start taking a bus, my mom told me to get an iPod so that way when it gets loud, I can just pull it out and listen to it. Now I did have a problem. About a week after I had the system installed, my laptop got a virus and I had to erase everything on it. As of now it is dead because my 8 year old cousin turned it on and forgot to turn it back off. FYI she kept on hounding me with "Can I have this?" over and over again. So when I went to listen to it, the battery died and I can't recharge it. I am going to get a replacement, I only paid [...] bucks for the darn thing and I only had 6 songs. The following are the songs I had on my iPod.
Rascal Flatts: Life is a Highway
Joe Nichols: What's a Guy Gotta Do?
Guitar Hero: Iron Man
Lion: Transformers
Green Day: Boulevard of Broken Dreams (I listened to that song most)
Hilsong United: From The Inside Out
My only real question was why it came with Apple Stickers?

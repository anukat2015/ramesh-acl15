Title: What about an external flash?
Content:
The camera is great!
Clear pics, quick response and the flash works pretty good.
I wonder which external flash should I buy to improve the night pics. It happens that my fiancée intends to kinda work as a wedding photographer and i wonder if this camera toghether with an external flash would be good enough to the task.
Any comment? Any external flash link?
Thanks ppl

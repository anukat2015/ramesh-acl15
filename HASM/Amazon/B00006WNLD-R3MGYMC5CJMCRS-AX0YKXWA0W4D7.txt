Title: Super Buy, Super Coffee
Content:
When I bought this machine I was suspicious.  Could something so inexpensive really do the job?  I bought it based on the high reviews.  I place an additional filter in the filter basket of the coffee pot.  This keeps coffee grinds from getting into any of the coffee maker mechanisms and into the cup.  I usually use one heaping tablespoon of Folgers or Heritage (local brand) coffee for a semi strong cup of coffee.  This is an excellent and worthwhile purchase for the dollar!  Enjoy! 
I'm going to add another comment here after owning this coffee maker for a while.  I would still give this five stars but want to alert people to the following.  This is an inexpensive commodity.  The back top area of the pot where you put in the water over time can slightly warp due to the steam heat from the water.  This means that the water can leak out a little bit and drip down the sides.  It's not a huge problem, however, it is somewhat annoying.  The whole unit is so inexpensive, that I just bought another one.  I keep the older one stored.  Wanted anyone to know this before purchasing.  This is **still** an excellent purchase for the money and replacement costs still minimal compared to more expensive units.

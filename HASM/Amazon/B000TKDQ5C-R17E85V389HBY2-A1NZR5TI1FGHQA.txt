Title: Good for TV room, quite noisy in a small guest bedroom

Length:: 2:26 MinsHere's my review of the Lasko 754200.
Update: 09 Feb 2009.  I have learned to sleep with the fan noise of this space heater.  However, I'm a very heavy sleeper.
Update: 26 Feb 2009.  I am keeping this Lasko heater in the living room.  I have bought another heater for my 8' x 10' guest bedroom, the Optimus H-5210 Infrared Quartz Radiant Heater available here on Amazon.  The Optimus is virtually silent, and takes a bit longer to heat a room that has a ceiling fan (from 60 degrees, it takes a couple hours to truly heat the room up to 70 degrees), and that's fine with me.  
Update: 08 March 2009.  I am very happy with my Optimus in the guest bedroom!

Title: Great little heater, but the feet are fragile!
Content:
I bought this heater for my wife a couple of years ago.  Unfortunately, one of the feet broke almost immediately.  My wife propped the heater on the broken foot and since she had a hardwood floor it wasn't much of a problem.  Now I'm repurposing it for my office, but I have a carpeted floor, and I'm a little more concerned.  I did a few internet searches, and I can not locate a Web site for the manufacturer to see about ordering a replacement foot.  I did see that there's an identical  product marketed under the "Dayton" brand name, but no luck searching there either.
Does anyone know how I can order a replacement foot?

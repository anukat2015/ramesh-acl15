Title: GREAT Space Heater.....
Content:
4-5 years ago I purchased 2 of these. I had to send 2 or 3 of them back initially as they were either damaged in shipping or not working...AFTER all of that they've been terrific and I am SO GLAD I have them!
 My father, now 87, likes to be VERY warm so when he comes to visit I place one next to or behind his arm chair and one in his bedroom to help BOOST the immediate heat.... 
At least once a winter (as in over last weekend) my boiler quits so I use them to maintain heat in the house (pipes don't freeze) until repair is done.... they radiate an even SAFE heat.... MUCH, MUCH better than those hot-air-blowers.
I've used them to work in the garage in the winter....they work wonders! 
Could not imagine life without them!
Good Luck!

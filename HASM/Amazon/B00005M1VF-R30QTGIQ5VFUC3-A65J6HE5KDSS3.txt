I really like this product. My husband doesn't drink coffee and I do. I love a cup each morning if not two. This allows me to take it with me if we go somewhere or to work. It fits in my car cup holders. It also allows me to make the coffee to my liking. It is very easy to clean and prepare. I find you can use other cups, they just have to be the correct size.

Title: Good value, makes pretty good coffee
Content:
This coffeemaker has all the features my old Krups had, which cost more than twice as much 6 or 7 years ago. I haven't been using it that long so I can't speak to its durability. But I like the brew strength setting. The thermal carafe is better than the Krups's was; I just poured a cup that was nearly hot enough to drink as is, 12 hours after making it. The carafe's pouring characteristics could be improved; one other reviewer noted that it was difficult to fill the reservoir without spilling, and this is true. You have to tilt the pitcher to a very high angle to drain it out, making the pour take longer and more prone to spillage. The automatic settings are easy to use. And the coffee tastes pretty good. I brewed it a little stronger than suggested to get the taste I like.

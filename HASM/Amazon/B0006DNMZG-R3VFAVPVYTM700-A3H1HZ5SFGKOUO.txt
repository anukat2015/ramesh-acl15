Title: Does what it does well
Content:
We own two of these units. We bought one to add supplemental heat to our infant daughter's drafty room and we have been very happy with its performance. We leave it on during nap times and at night and it doesn't get dangerously hot, nor does the cord get unnervingly hot, so we feel comfortable having it in her room. We also like the fact that the heat it generates doesn't make the room air excessively dry - we haven't had to overcompensate by adding more humidity to the room to make it comfortable. The fan also provides some soothing white noise! We use the other heater in our basement TV room, which gets chilly during the winter, and we appreciate it for the same qualities as mentioned above, though the noise does require the TV sound to be turned up a bit, but it's nothing oppressive. All in all, very satisfied.

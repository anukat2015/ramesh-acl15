Title: Great except for the keyboard
Content:
I got this last week and am generally pleased.  The display is great--large and very sharp.  Everything works very quickly, and there weren't too many junky programs preloaded.
HOWEVER, they keyboard is really terrible.  It fails to recognize about 1 in 10 letters I type.  Then, sometimes, it doubles letters.  It is very, very frustrating to type on this thing.  I would not recommend it if you have lots of typing to do!

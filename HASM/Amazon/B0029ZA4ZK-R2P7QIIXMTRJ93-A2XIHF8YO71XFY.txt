Title: Great value for a notebook that perfomrs very well!
Content:
At $999 with free prime shipping and a $50 rebate, this notebook was an especially good buy.  While I wish it had a lit keyboard (that is a great feature in my MacBook Pro), the DV6-1280US has a number of selling points:  a large hard drive, speed, great resolution, and its all black.  Others have left lengthier reviews, and I agree with all that they have said.  In short, this is a great notebook (I have had probably 10 over the years) and I highly recommend it.

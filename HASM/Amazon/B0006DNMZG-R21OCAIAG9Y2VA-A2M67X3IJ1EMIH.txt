Title: only good for a very small space and takes time to heat
Content:
I got this for my bathroom for getting out of the shower in the wintertime.  The fan speed is very low.  Even the high speed barely blows air that much.  It will warm a small bathroom, but will take some time getting there.  Not nearly as powerful as I'd hoped.

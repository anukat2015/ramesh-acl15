Title: Gateway M305CRV a terrible computer
Content:
Unlike the previous two reviewers I did own this exact model computer.  It was a problem from day one.  Gateway's customer service was not helpful and outright hostile at times.  It crashed everytime it was used and its graphics speed was well below average.  It bogged down everytime any game was played.  Painfully slow.  I determined that I will never own another Gateway computer ever.  I have found that Dell's customer service was much easier to deal with.  I rated this item at one star because I could not get it to rate lower than that.

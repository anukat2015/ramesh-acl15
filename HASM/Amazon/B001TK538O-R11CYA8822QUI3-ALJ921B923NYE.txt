Title: California Coffee Lover
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker with an Amazon online gift card, and I just love it!  My husband is a firefighter and is gone a lot.  I feel silly making a pot of coffee for just one person, and I won't drink it reheated in the microwave..eewww!  So, this is the PERFECT solution.  We keep two coffeemakers on the kitchen counter.  And, since I don't use it all the time, it's not too expensive.  And I did take advantage of the online product registration with Keurig and got free coffee with free shipping- TWO boxes!  $26 worth.  I picked several different kinds to try out in my new machine.  I love the flavor it produces, and yes I am a Starbucks and Peets coffee drinker who likes strong coffee.  So, when you play around with it, you can get the strength of coffee you like.  And it IS NOT NOISY.  It just makes average coffeemaker noises. The water tank is quite easy to remove and replace.  It is quite easy to clean too.  Every once in a while it makes a cup a size smaller than I selected.  I don't know why.  I just run more water through.  I use it to make coffee.  I think if you want espresso, you need to just buy an espresso machine. That's just common sense.

Title: No louder than any product with a fan,
Content:
I almost did not buy because of some crying here about the noise.  But decided for that price, I'd try and glad I did it is a very good product for its small size and the Noise, no more than you expect from any product with a fan.
I'm using in a 32x20' den with 20' of glass facing North, and it does such a good job I turned off all the other heat sources for this room, today it's running 50 degrees outside and the heater cycles on and off as I would expect, appears it is costing about 5c per hour to operate, I have a Kw meter on the outlet to measure usage for a few days.  
If I were buying again I would probably buy the next size up so to get better directional control of the output, this one is 360 radius output only and the larger units you can damper down to 180 degrees radius on the output. 
But couldn't be happier with this small investment.  It's ready to plugin and go out of the box.

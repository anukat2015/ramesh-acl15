Title: does what it should
Content:
I have a room that's 15x15, hardwood floors, and lots of windows: good because of plentiful light, bad because they're drafty.  The heater takes a while to get going, but keeps a room steadily warm.  I never have to use the maximum setting.
The winter has been relatively mild thus far, so I have yet to test this heater in the midst of a true New England winter.  But so far, I've been very satisfied with this product.
P.S.  It's possible the clicks may have to do with the timer dial.  I don't bother using it, so I switch all the tabs off (toward the center).  I haven't heard any unusual loud clicks, and I'm a light sleeper.

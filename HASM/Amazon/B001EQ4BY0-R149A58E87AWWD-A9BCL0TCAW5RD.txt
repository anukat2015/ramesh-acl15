"Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)
I am not one to normally write reviews.  However, I am so impressed with this camera that I feel obligated to sing its praises.  This was my first digital SLR after being a die-hard film guy for over 40 years.  I sold off my Nikon F2A, motor drive and several lenses and have never looked back.  Being a devout Nikon guy, I considered the Nikon digital SLRs, but like my pocket Nikon digital camera, they felt poorly made and the navigation was anything but intuitive.
The Canon 50D feels solid, and if you don't mind a larger body and the weight (I prefer it) you will be impressed with the solid feel of the body and all of the controls.  The navigation is so easy you almost don't need the instruction manual.  I purchased the Canon 18-200AF-IS zoom lens, and although there is some minor (real minor) distortion at both ends of the focal planes, it is a great "one lens solution that provides a 35mm equivalent range of about 28-300mm.  The pictures are razor sharp, and the raw image software is effective and easy to use.  My only criticism of this camera is that occasionally in low light (even with an external Canon flash attached) it sometimes will not fire in auto mode because it decides there is not enough light.  This can be resolved by using manual mode.
A great camera - it has exceeded my expectations.

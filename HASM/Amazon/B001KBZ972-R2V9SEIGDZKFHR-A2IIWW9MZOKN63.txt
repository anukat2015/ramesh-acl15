Title: Best Value/Performance Ratio on Amazon
Content:
After a year of my DeLonge 12-cup I decided to donate it and buy a Mr. Coffee MRX36 in red.  It is incredibly easy to use and program, has near-Italian styling, lots of features, and makes a fabulous cup of coffee--fast.  I paid $61 and, now that I have experienced it, I would glady pay much more.  You won't regret buying this well built coffee maker.

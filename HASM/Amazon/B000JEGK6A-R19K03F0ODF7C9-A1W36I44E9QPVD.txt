Title: Very nice room heater
Content:
A little smaller than I had anticipated, this little heater does a nice job.  I bought it for a basement tool room we have, which stays very cold in the winter.  Turn this baby on and in ten minutes it's comfy in there.  The amount of heat emanating from its small front doesn't seem like it will heat a room well, but it does.  It's very quiet, you can't tell when it's on, whether it's set on oscillating or not.  It oscillates about 90 degrees.
Having small children in the house, I like how you can touch it anywhere during its operation and not get burned.  The automatic shut-off feature is also a good thing.  There are two settings, low and high (600/1200 watts), and both seem to do the job well.

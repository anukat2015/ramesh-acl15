Title: Heated door mat
Content:
I purchased this heated mat because my 87 year old Mom moved in and was also recoveing from a broken hip. the mat is great but there are problems. Once the ice and snow melts off, it freezes a band on the outer edge of the mat that is not heated. Another issue is that you need to go out and lift the mat to get off the melted snow and ice water or when you turn the mat off, it will re freeze. Despite its issues, we do love it because the first step out of the house is alway safe and then you can grab onto the railing . Everytime it snows we turn on the mat and then when melted we go out and lift it to get off the excess water and turn it off. I do recommened it but be aware of the issues related to it, hense the 4 stars.

Title: Very Nice Camera
Content:
I'm really pleased with this purchase.  The camera is responsive, it's easy to use yet has the capacity to be quite sophisticated.  I haven't figured everything out yet, like whether or not you can use the screen to frame a picture.  If so, it's not obvious.  But I wanted a nice digital camera, and this really fits the bill. The colors are gorgeous. Now to get one of those supernice nikon zoom lenses...hmmmmm...

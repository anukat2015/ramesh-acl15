Title: Cute Ipod
Content:
I think ipods are the best an mp3 player can get. I also own the 60G ipod video which I've had for 3 yrs now. The headphone jack has decided to quit on me and I plan on having it fixed but was looking for something less bulky. I'm an avid music lover and have over 25G of music to groove to so the 16G (keep in mind, you can't fill up the entire 16G, it's more like 15G) is a bit small from the standpoint of trying to fit all my favorites - a 20G would be much better but unfortunately not an option. Overall I dig the 16G, loving the pink. Only real complaint is it doesn't show the time which isn't the end of the world but is a nice convenience on my 60G. The price is right on Amazon, everywhere else it's selling for at least $30 more.

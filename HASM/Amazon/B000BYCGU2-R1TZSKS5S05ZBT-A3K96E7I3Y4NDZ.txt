Title: Makes great coffee
Content:
I've been researching for a long time to buy a good coffee maker as I've been used to the espresso machine all the time. After a lot of research finally decided on buying this one.
It took a couple of attempts to make good coffee until i figured to use 3-5 cups option for making strong coffee. Since then, I've been enjoying the great coffee every morning, now I almost don't miss my espresso machine anymore. It's definitely pricey compared to other coffee makers, but it's certainly worth it.

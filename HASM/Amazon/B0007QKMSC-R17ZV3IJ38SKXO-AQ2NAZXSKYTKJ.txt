Title: Best bang for the buck DSLR.
Content:
New to DSLRs, I was initially debating between the Nikon D40 and this camera. The XT offered many advantages over the D40, just do some research and you'll learn quickly. Purchased the camera with the kit lens 18-55mm, I do believe the kit lens does offer good general use. But depending on your primary use you'll soon discover that an upgraded lens will really allow the XT to shine. I've recently purchase a 70-200mm 4LCanon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras and can't wait to snap some pictures at motorsport events, air shows, landscape, ect.
Great camera.

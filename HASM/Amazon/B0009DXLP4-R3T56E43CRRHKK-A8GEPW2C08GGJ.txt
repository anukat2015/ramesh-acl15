Title: Good cleaner but fragile plastic parts.
Content:
The title says it all.  I've had this product for a couple of years and have had to get the plastic "neck" that attaches the wand to the floor head twice already.  However, it does very well on tough carpets (dark blue with white persian cat hair!) and the mobility is terrific.  Long hose, small low profile head, long cord.  Oh, the cord still pops out of the socket... but at least not as often!

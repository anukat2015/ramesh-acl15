Title: 2nd (and last) Cuisinart coffee maker
Content:
Cuisinart has fooled me twice now with their Grind and Brew, but they will not fool me again. The first Grind and Brew was so time consuming to clean, I only used it for about 6 months and then sent it to the basement until I could unload it at a garage sale. I next bought the original Melita Mill & Brew and absolutely adored it. When Cuisinart came out with this model that had an insulated carafe, I could not resist. When I found it at the store, one of the first things I noticed on the box was "easier to clean." I took it out of the box to take a look at it and decided to give it a try. It worked pretty good for a few weeks, even though there are 6 pieces that have to be washed every night (7 including the pot itself). And then came the first time I pushed the button to get to the basket assembly and it wouldn't open. That was the night I discovered that the coffee grounds go all over the place, especially in the area of the sliding basket assembly. Now, I have to take a toothbrush every night to clean all of the coffee grounds out of the machine. And this was supposed to be easier to clean!!
To add insult to injury, just a couple of weeks after I bought this machine, I discovered that Melita also had a model with an insulated carafe. That's why I'm on the Amazon.com site at this time -- to order the new Melita so I can relegate another Cuisinart to the junk pile (don't even think I'm going to try to sell this one to anyone; don't want to burden anyone else with this garbage).

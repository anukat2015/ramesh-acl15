Title: Great under my desk.
Content:
I needed a little something to keep my feet warm at my desk.  This is small enough for the job.  I put it on the lowest setting and it keeps me toasty warm. It pulls the air in through the top and sends it out the bottom where I need it.  My cat enjoys sitting under the desk for the warmth, too.
I can also use it to warm the entire room when I'm not sitting at my desk.  I just turn the setting a little higher.  The room I have it in is 15 x 18, and it has warmed it up as an addition to the furnace.  I have not tried it as the only heat source.  It is not loud, and there is no smell to it.
I would definitely recommend this product.  I am happy with mine.  Of course how well you will like it will depend on the job you want it to do.  The price was very good on Amazon compared to buying at the local stores.  The cheapest I saw it locally was at Walmart for $39.99.  Instead of paying for shipping, I also bought a DVD that I had planned on getting, which made the shipping free.
Great product, great price, and great service.  I am a satisfied customer.

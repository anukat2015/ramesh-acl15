Title: Mixed feelings
Content:
1. The initial setup is tooooo slow, but after is up and running it works really good.
2. The synchronization is AWESOME, different than Ipod where all things need to be sync every single time Zune updates the device info and is very quick.
3. Cannot be used as a portable hard drive. :(
4. I purchased music in my office as a guest and I haven't found a way to get to my home where I have Zune set up permanently, therefore I have to separated music libraries (I also tried importing then trough a USB like I do with my Ipod and could not be done).
5. No videos in marketplace.
6. I am in Puerto Rico and the marketplace will not accept ANY credit card that doesn't have a US address, therefore you need to buy Zune pass prepaid cards in order to buy music and it's a hassle to go to the store every time you run out of points.  
Overall I like Zune more than the Ipod because it is more user friendly.

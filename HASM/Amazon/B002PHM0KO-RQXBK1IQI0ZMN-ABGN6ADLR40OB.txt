Title: Buy this in lieu of a Macbook or Macbook Pro. Outstanding notebook!!
Content:
I've owned this Sony Vaio for 3 weeks now & let me tell you this is one kick butt Notebook. I've always been a Mac guy (owned 2 Powerbooks & currently have a iMac desktop) but now with Windows 7 (64 bit), I believe that Microsoft has caught up with Apple in their OS.
Number 1: this is a beautiful looking machine, which is important to me. I didn't want yet another black notebook. It has an off-white keyboard against its Silver body, very attractive.
The specs are terrific, 4gb & 320 hard drive, and this computer is rocket fast!! Windows 7 boots up in less than 10 seconds EVERY time (just like a mac). Why spend the extra money on a Macbook or  Mac Pro when you can get a notebook with better specs and a similar OS for 2/3rds's the price.
If the OS was XP or Vista, no way, but, Windows 7 is that good. Very similar to OSX. This Sony Vaio with Windows 7 is a superb machine.
The only negative is that the Battery life should be longer, I'm getting about 3 hours which is OK, but Sony can do better than that.

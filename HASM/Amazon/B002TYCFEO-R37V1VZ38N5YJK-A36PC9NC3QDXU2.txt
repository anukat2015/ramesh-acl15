Title: CHEAP LAPTOP
Content:
My title sums it up.  It's cheap in every way.
Worst trackpad ever.  That's not true.  My girlfriend's $800 Toshiba has a worse trackpad, but this one is still terrible.  As I write this review it will suddenly select a part of the paragraph up a couple lines and I'll find myself typing in the middle of where I already was typing.  Argh!!
That's not the worst part.  Every time I wake this computer from sleep, it is 100X slower than before.  It is so bad that if I ever accidentally put it to sleep (like, close the lid), I just hold down the power key and restart it.  It's unusably slow after sleep... like the processor never fully cycles-up after sleep mode.  But if it never goes to sleep (I've changed the settings so when it is plugged in it never goes to sleep) it is fine.  I'm trying to contact Acer "Technical Support", which so far has been an oxy-moron.  Typical of PCs but I believe Acer is one of the worst in this department.
This is on a brand-new computer.  No porn, no spyware, no programs installed by me except iTunes.
Cough up the dough and get a Mac.  If you can't afford one, suffer with something like this?
I bought it as a present for my Mother but now I kinda feel bad about it.  And I dread the phone calls I'm about to get about "this and that doesn't work blah blah blah".

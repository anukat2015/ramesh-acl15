Title: Fasten your seatbelts. We are about to take off.
Content:
The noise generated by this space heater is, in my opinion, greater than the heat. I bought this heater for my office and the first time I turned it on, I felt like I had just stepped onto the jetway with an airliner starting it's engines. The heat it generates is okay, but one has to turn on the fan to get it, and since the noise level is the same whether you set the fan at Low, I am giving this away and will get a quieter one for my office.

Title: Great...If it is what you are really looking for
Content:
This heater is great for certain uses, not so good for the others. I keep mine under (and behind) my desk on low (only 400 watts) and it keeps me at a perfect temperature. I used to have a little ceramic box heater I used for the same job, and even on high (1500 watts) it didn't work nearly as well.
With that said, also keep this in mind. When this heater is on, it is REALLY bright. You don't want it pointing at your face. I tried it in the TV room pointing at the couch (with me on it) and it was to distracting. Like looking directly into a 100 watt light bulb. You need this heater either below, behind or beside you. If you can do that, you will be very happy with it.
One more thing to consider. I tried a different Radiant heater before this and it had internal fans to keep it cool. Sounded like a 747 taking off. This one has no fans and is completely quiet, a great thing!

Title: Nice Machine
Content:
After breaking another carafe from a Mr. Coffee machine and not being able to find a replacement I checked the reviews on the internet to find a new machine.  Although this coffee maker costs more than many models I feel it is worth it.  The construction is solid and looks nice but more importantly it makes great coffee and is easy to use.  I have had it for about a month and so far so good.  It has a 3 year warranty.

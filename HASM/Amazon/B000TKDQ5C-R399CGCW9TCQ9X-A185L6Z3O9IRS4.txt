Title: Love it!
Content:
My sister has the same heater and she recommended I buy it. It's awesome! It heats up my entire room (which is on the smaller side), and my roommate was totally surprised at how well it works. Great if you just want a personal heater and don't want to rack up the gas bill (since I have 3 roommates, it's kind of awkward/wasteful to turn on the central heating when I'm the only one who's home). It heats up quickly too, which is what I really like. I turn it on as soon as I wake up, when it's super cold in the early morning and the room feels warm almost immediately. But, like I said, my room is on the smaller side, so I don't know how it would work for larger rooms.

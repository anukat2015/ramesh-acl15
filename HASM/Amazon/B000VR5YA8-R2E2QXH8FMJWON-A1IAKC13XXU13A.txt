Title: Fabulous but...
Content:
This is a fantastic camera and I'm thrilled to own it. Not much to complain about and most of the other reviewers covered the pros and cons really well. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for one very annoying restriction: the inability to bracket exposures in steps greater than 1 EV automatically ( of course you can do this manually)  Silly restriction that makes creating HDR's more of a pain. This is a great camera otherwise and I highly recommend it.

Title: too much junk in the trunk
Content:
My vacuum shot craps so  it was time, i read alott of reviews on it and pretty much everyone liked it.  I think its ok , it is heavy, has a lott of hose, tools all stuck on the arm of the vacuum.  It sucks up hair great the hair eraser, its just something to get you to buy it, it doesn't work that great i keep it up up most of the time.  The way the hose connects to the vacuum its always in your way. The way the tools hook on  the front  was not thought out well enough ,probably what i need to say is it works ok ,picks up hair and dirt but the design is pretty lame  way to much junk on it for me

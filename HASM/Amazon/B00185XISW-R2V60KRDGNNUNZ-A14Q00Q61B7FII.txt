Title: Extremely hot to the touch
Content:
CAUTION!  This heater gets extremely hot to the touch.  The wall behind the heater will also get quite hot.  I have been using this heater for over a year to heat my bathroom which has no other source of heat.  I have it connected to a thermostat that plugs into the wall outlet.  I have to set the thermostat way up between 76-78 to maintain the room around 69 because the heater, the wall, and the thermostat will get very hot before the room begins to get warm.  If you don't connect the heater to a thermostat, the heater will get incredibly hot to the touch.  I can't tell that it has saved any on my electric bill over the oil-filled radiator heater I had been using previously.  It is low profile and unobtrusive except the plug sticks straight out and when you connect that to a thermostat it sticks out about 5 inches.  It would have been nice to have a flat 90-degree plug and a storage mechanism for the excess power cord.

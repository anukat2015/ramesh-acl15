Title: Hamilton Beach Red Coffee Pot
Content:
This is an attractive and easy to use coffee pot. I love the color. The coffee is hotter than it is with other electric coffee pots. I was surprised that it had a basket filter; I had expected a cone filter which I think makes more flavorful coffee. But, by adding a bit extra (Peets) coffee, I have been able to achieve the strength and flavor that I like. I think the type of filter should have been disclosed on Amazon in description of the product.

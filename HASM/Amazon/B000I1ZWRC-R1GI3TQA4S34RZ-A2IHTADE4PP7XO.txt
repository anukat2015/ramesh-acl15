Title: Great Camera
Content:
I am new into the world of SLR photography and this camera has been great for a newbie.  One of my friends, who is an experienced photographer, noticed that the XTi takes dark pictures on the manual settings. This issue is discussed at length in many forums and reviews of this camera and I have not found this to be a major problem.  With over 500 shots so far I am really enjoying the camera and can't wait to get more lenses.  On the subject of lenses I would get the camera body only and spend a couple hundred more on a better lens to start.  With the underexposure issue, I would consider one if the IS (image stabilization) lenses which allows you to take pictures at up to 3 shutter speeds slower with out blurring the image from camera shake.

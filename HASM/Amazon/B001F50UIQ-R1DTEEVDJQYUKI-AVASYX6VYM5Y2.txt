Title: Its smaller than I thought
Content:
When I was buying this player at toys r us, I realized how small it was than I thought. The player is not as loud with the music as when I listen to the music in the computer. Thats the only problem I have. Im going to change the headphones. I prefer the silicone headphones that you can fit in your ear because they don't fall out of your ears. I hate that the headphones that it comes with has the string shorter than the other side of the headphones (its like about a half shorter than the other side).  Also I think the sound quality with the player's headphones is good but I want it to be 3 levels louder but it is loud, not loud, loud,: just loud; like I can hear the bass really good (but theres no treble) and the radio is great. The video quality is excellent. The thing I like the most about this player is that its easy to use and I know how to use all the features and I didn't have to read the booklet. In fact I never read the booklet. I haven't found the perfect headphones yet that compares to the headphones that came with the player. Now I have to go on a headphone shopping spree. 5 in a half stars.

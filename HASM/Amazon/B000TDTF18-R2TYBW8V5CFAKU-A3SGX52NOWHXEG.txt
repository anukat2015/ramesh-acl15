Title: Delonghi front loading coffeemaker
Content:
Like others , we have begun to experience the leaking and burnt coffee smell. I believe we have traced it to the lever arm in the back that makes the sneak a cup feature work. It appears that over time this part becomes misshapen , and no longer works properly. I did have success in stopping the leaks by removing the spring from under the filter holder. No more leaks , but , of course, now the sneak a cup feature does not work. But , to me that is really no big deal .But, for those looking for a "first aid" fix to the leak problem, removing the spring does seem to work . Thanks to the other reviewer for suggesting it.

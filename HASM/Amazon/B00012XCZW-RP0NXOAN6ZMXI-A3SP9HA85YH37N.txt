Title: Many good things
Content:
The coffee brews fast and is great tasting.  We now make a carafe of tea using 3-4 teabags rather than boil water.  If this coffee maker lasts as long as I have heard - it will the best value for the money of any coffee maker we have ever purchased.  The coffee is hot and does not taste leftover when it has sat on the warmer plate.  We have been telling others when they complain about having to purchase new every year that Bunn NHB is the way to go.  We have not had any problems with the carafe either.  It does not dribble - pours great.

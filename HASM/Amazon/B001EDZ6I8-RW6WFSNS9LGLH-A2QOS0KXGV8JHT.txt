Title: Very handy for a cold old house
Content:
I'll echo some of the other reviews here on Amazon that the thing smells pretty funky when you first open it up. If you're able, I'd set on your porch or basement and let it run for awhile before using it for the first time. It's not intolerable, but no reason to deal with it if you don't have to.
This is a very handy little unit. I live in an old house in Pittsburgh and it's very drafty and I have roommates that like to save money by keeping the heat down. So, this little thing is perfect for keeping me going. No need to turn up the heat to stay warm. It cranks out a good bit of heat on high, quite enough to keep your feet good and toasty even in a cold room. The massage nubs are also quite a joy, you'll find yourself rubbing your feet over the thing without noticing (I recommend socks). Also, the rubber feet are good for keeping it in place wherever you put it and so you can push against it to roll your desk chair back.
I can't speak to the cold air side of things as I've only used it in the winter so far. But, I'm more than happy with the purchase. 
If you're looking for something to keep your feet warm in a cold room, you can't go wrong with this device.

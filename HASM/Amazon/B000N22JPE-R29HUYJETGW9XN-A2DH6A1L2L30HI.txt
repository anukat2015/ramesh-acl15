Title: Great coffee pot for the price we paid
Content:
The Braun coffee pot we were using had a much larger opening for pouring in water and could be accessed from either side.  However, pouring water into Cuisinart coffee pot has not been a problem.  My wife and I have yet to miss the opening.  We did not buy Braun again because we heard the quality went down, but the price did not.  We had the Braun for over 5 years before it began to leak.  
The Cuisinart was easy to program.  The filter basket is easily removed to empty the coffee grains.  Although it takes a cone filter, we've been able to use the regular filters that we buy in bulk (Bunn or Mr. Coffee type filters).  We are both very pleased with our purchase.

Title: Quiet
Content:
I just bought this unit from Target, and it is great.  
First of all, it is very quiet.  The only noise is makes is the sound of oil percolating around in metal housing, which is actually soothing.  It is powerful enough to heat our average size bedroom (about 15'x15') even on the lowest setting, and it is below freezing outside.
It is really nice to have a thermostat.  You can set it and it will keep your room at a constant temperature.  The non-digital model is about $20 cheaper, but just get this one.  I've used heaters with no thermostat, and you can never get it to hold constant at a nice temperature.  You will wake up too hot or too cold.
The Honeywell costs a little more than the cheap-o brand, but it is WELL worth it.  The first radiator heater I bought was cheap-o from Walmart.  It made a really loud electrical arcing noise every time it kicked on.  It was loud enough to wake us up.  It sounded like those weapons from War of the Worlds.

Title: Bunn NHB Professional Home Brewer
Content:
This unit was purchased to replace a Bunn unit several years old. It functions well, as the Bunn coffee makers do, keeping a measure of water hot for quick brewing. This model allows one to pour in fresh water with the decanter, instead of an alternate pitcher, because the user starts the brewing flow when closing the top cover. This is a convenient feature and an improvement over the older models. This unit is slightly smaller than the origional, making it more attractive on the kitchen counter.

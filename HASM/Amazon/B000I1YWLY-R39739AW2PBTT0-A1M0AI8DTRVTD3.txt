Title: I don't see the differrence with a new! The best vaccum ever!
Content:
I didn't want to spend 500 bucks for a vaccum, but I know to get a good one you can not be cheap.
So I decided, reading the reviews to buy a refurbished one. 
I use to have a Dyson in Europe, but for the price it's not worth it, and Electrolux is a very good brand.
This one is compact, powerfull, very clean and super easy to empty. The Turbo Brush is amazing! The carpet is like new!
I really recommend to buy this vaccum.

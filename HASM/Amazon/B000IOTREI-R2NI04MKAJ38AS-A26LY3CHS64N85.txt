Title: Perfect Personal Heater
Content:
Presto HeatDish Plus Footlight - Parabolic Electric Heater
This, I believe, is a perfect personal heater for one person or possibly two sitting close together.  It radiates heat like the warmth of sunshine. In addition, it's more energy efficient than most other heaters. I did some research before purchasing this one.  I was dissatisfied with convection type portable heaters I used previously.   I have high ceilings and most of the heat would end up on the ceiling while I was still cold. And, my electric bill really shot up.  
It states in large print on the outside packaging of this Heatdish heater that it is not intended to heat a room and is not designed to do that.  It only heats the objects it is directed at.  And that it does.

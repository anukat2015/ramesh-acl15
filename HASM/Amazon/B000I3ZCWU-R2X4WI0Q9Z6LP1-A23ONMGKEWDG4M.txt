Title: Learning to Use The XTi
Content:
There are more then enough comments on how great this camera is.  My comment is to strongly suggest that any user buy the "Magic Lantern DVD guide" for the Canon Rebel XTi.   Yeh, there's a canon book.  Yes, there are books published on how to use.  This hands on DVD takes you through every basic, and some advanced steps, and actually shows you "how To."  DVD: Magic Lantern DVD Guide for Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi / EOS 400D SLR Cameras. The author uses nothing but clear, easy to understand, language.  The only thing he assumes you understand are f-stops and shutter speeds.
It's like being taught One-on-One with a knowledgable instructor.  Best $20 I've spent. And, that included shipping.

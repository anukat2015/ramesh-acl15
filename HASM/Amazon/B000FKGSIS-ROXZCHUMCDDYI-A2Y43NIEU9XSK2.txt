Title: short life expectancy
Content:
This heater worked fine at first, and I did use it for several months.  After spending Spring and Summer tucked away in a closet, it failed on the first cool day this fall that I attempted to use it.  The heater now shuts off as soon as it gets hot - less than 5 minutes - and goes into reset mode - cannot be started again till it cools down. It will start again after it cools, but again will shut down automatically after about a minute.  It's pretty much worthless now.

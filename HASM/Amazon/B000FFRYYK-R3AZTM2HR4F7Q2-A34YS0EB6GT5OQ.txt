Title: Good brewer but missing features
Content:
The coffee brewed is good but weak if the suggested amount is used. With the concern of wasted energy I am surprised there is no timer clock and method for starting a brew automatically. Coffee in 3 minutes is misleading because it takes about 10 minutes more to bring cold water up to temperature if the heater element is left off to save energy. Also I wonder about the health safety of leaving cold water in the internal tank and mold forming.
The thermal carafe is designed better than a previous brand carafe we had, for the coffee is fairly hot in the morning after a brew the night before.
The overall construction is solid with stainless steel carafe and heater tank but the outside is too hot to the touch in one area directly under top tank section.

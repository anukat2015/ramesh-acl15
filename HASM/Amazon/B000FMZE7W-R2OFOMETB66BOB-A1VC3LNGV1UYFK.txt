Title: Do not purchase a refurbished unit
Content:
This product was purchased as a christmas gift and was a real disappointment when the software that was included did not allow the unit to sync.  Sync is the process which allows media to be downloaded from the PC or laptop to the Zune unit.  I installed the software on both a desktop PC as well as a laptop PC and the result was the same in that the Zune was never detected by the PC.  Both of these PC's are running microsoft windows XP. 
Bottom line is that the Zune is not useable which is an extreme disappointment especially for a child who had hoped to receive this for christmas.
Therefore, BEWARE when you purchase refurbished electronics as software is tricky and if not up to date can cause problems.  I will never purchase refurbished again.

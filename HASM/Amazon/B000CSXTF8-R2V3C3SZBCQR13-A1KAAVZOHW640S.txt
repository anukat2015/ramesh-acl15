Title: I'm Loving It...
Content:
Update 11-28-08: I've had this for 2 summers now & it still works like new...
.....pros.....
+...It works great for my medium-sized apartment, keeping it cool.
+...It's reasonably quiet on low fan speed; at least quieter than my last air conditioner. (An inexpensive G.E. model)
+...Sleek, modern design with good looks, electronic keypad, temp sensor & remote control.
+...Multiple settings, with 3 fan speeds (high; med; low) for each: "Fan"; "Cool"; "Energy Saver"; and "Dehumidifier".
+...Great price! (At least at the time I bought it) :)
.....cons.....
-...Installation instructions are a little weak- it's best to have experienced help- drilling involved.
-...The included side flaps have a number of air gaps. I recommend white duct tape for extra sealing.
-...It advertises "Whisper Quiet" on the box- seems like a bit of marketing exaggeration, in my opinion.
-...Temperature sensor seems to be a bit off at times.
-..."Energy Saver" seems tricky- instructions say it'll shut off for 3 minutes periodically- mine seems to shut off for good.
In spite of these issues, I'm giving this 5 stars- I'm exceedingly happy with it! We get a number of searingly hot 100+ degree summer days with humidity here in Chicago, and my apartment is keeping cool to say the least. I even have to switch to fan sometimes to keep it from getting too cold; it's really that effective. 5 Stars!

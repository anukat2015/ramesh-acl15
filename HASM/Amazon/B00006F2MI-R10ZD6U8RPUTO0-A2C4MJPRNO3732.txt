Title: Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew, Brushed Chrome
Content:
The Cuisart Grind and Brew is excellent especially the stainless steel coffee pot. The real value is regardless of when the coffee is brewed we do not have stale coffee that has burned onto the bottom of the plate.  The coffee stays hot and fresh.  We also really love this product because we got such a wonderful price on Amazon, cheaper than going direct to Cuisinart.  Who could ask for more?

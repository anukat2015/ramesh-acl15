Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
Our experience with the Zojirushi EC-BD15 Coffee Maker was quite disappointing. The first time we used it, water leaked from the reservoir onto our counter. We notified the Amazon vendor (Chefs Corner), who made it easy for us to return the defective machine and soon sent a replacement. Actually, Chefs Corner mistakenly sent us two replacements, and we immediately returned one. Unfortunately, the replacement machine that we kept was missing a part and, consequently, became clogged with coffee grounds and slopped coffee onto our counter. Furthermore, the carafe did a poor job keeping the coffee hot. Zojirushi clearly has quality-control problems, so we did not bother requesting another replacement. We cannot recommend this coffee maker.

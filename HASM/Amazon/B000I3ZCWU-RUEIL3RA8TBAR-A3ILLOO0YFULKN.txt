Title: Best value in a DSLR
Content:
Did an extensive comparison of all DSLRs with particular emphasis on Nikon and Canon. The is the best value and you sacrifice nothing in the way of bells and whistles. It's fast and responsive and I particularly like the picture style settings where I can set parameters and quickly change the settings as conditions change. Comparing it to the Nikon D40
or D40X, the XTi offers so much more, I couldn't begin to list it here.
Go for it, if you looking for your first DSLR or a backup to the higher end Canons.

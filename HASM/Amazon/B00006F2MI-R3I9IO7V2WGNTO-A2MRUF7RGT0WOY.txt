Title: Great, hot coffee all day
Content:
This machine (the Thermal Caraffe version) is good at two things- making fresh coffee, and keeping the coffee hot. It requires a little more cleaning, as people point out, but you can brew a pot at 7am, and it will still be 120 degrees when you get home from work that night (I've tested it). I've owned it for 2 years and have never had a problem with it leaking/clogging/anything.

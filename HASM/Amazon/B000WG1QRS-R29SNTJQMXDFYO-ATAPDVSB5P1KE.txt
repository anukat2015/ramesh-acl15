Title: Zune 4GB microsoft
Content:
i really liked the menu of the zune (2nd gnrtion) it's way easy to use and
also the browsing is easier than ipods, at least for me, i've been using both for several years and now i prefer zune. really good sound as the song is recorded.
contras: well, i guess they didnt make a EQualizer or presets to set music. also when you buy it (even new), at least the (2nd GNRTION) dont bring the CD with it, you have to download all the software from the website, that's a little confusing for someone who's not Bill gates. but anyway, if you want to surprise somebody with a gift, this is a good choice.

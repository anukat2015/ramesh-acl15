Title: Kruzin' over dust bunnies
Content:
I have to admit, the Kruz IS cute and looks just fine sitting in the corner. It works wonders on the dust bunnies and clumps of cat hair, but not so good on heavier items, like food particles on the kitchen floor (ceramic tile). I was also disappointed while trying to vacuum up the kitty litter (sand) that my cat kicks outside her box. Summing it up, it's not great, but it is handy to get those occasional dust bunnies off the hardwood without dragging out the canister.  It is extremely manuverable, as well.

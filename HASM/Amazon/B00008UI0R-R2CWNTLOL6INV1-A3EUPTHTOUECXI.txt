Title: The worst vacuum I ever owned and the worst cusomer service
Content:
I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this vac.  I used it 4 times and it broke.  I have a studio apartment so it did not get heavy use.  I called the company, they do not have a toll free telephone number so you have to pay high toll calls and wait on line forever. There is no company repair store in my area.  I would have had to ship it elsewhere for service.  Hoover is not the company they used to be 30 years ago and their service is non-existent.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

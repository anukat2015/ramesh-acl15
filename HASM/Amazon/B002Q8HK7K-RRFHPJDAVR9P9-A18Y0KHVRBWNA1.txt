Title: The best laptop AAAA++++
Content:
I almost didn't buy this laptop after watching review on Youtube from Expert Laptop Review I think the laptop they used for review was the Demo laptop it's look differnce from the one I got from Amazon ASUS UL80Vt-A1 
The battery last 8+ hrs with normal setting could last 10+ with low setting
Very fast overall used
The screen was bright and clear very happy 
many of cool stuff
2 Year Global Warranty and 1 Year Accidental Damage Warranty
If you are looking for the best laptop this is the right one I paid $823 plus $100 gift card free

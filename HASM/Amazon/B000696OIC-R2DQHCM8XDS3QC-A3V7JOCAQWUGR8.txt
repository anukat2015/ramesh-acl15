Title: Mixed feelings
Content:
I bought this for my husband for Christmas and yes we are having the dripping problems.  I called Delonghi and they sent the rubber seal for the lid, that didn't work.  I called them again and I told them I bought it at Amazon.  They said that Amazon probably had an older design of this product.  Maybe Starbucks has a newer model?  They are sending me a new "redesigned" maker.  I am a bit irritated because you have to cut the cord from the machine pay to mail it, and also send them a shipping and handling check for $7.50.  I know $7.50 isn't a big deal but it is more of the principal since it is under warranty.  I should be getting the new one in a few weeks, I will write a review about that one.  
The sleek design and removable water tank are great.  The coffee stays warm (not brewed hot) throughout the day, but I put cream in me coffee so I have to nuke it for about 20 sec.  The coffee doesn't have the burnt taste of a conventional hot plate.  The timer is stupid.  Makes a great cup of coffee.  As far as what else is out there, the market for thermal carafes is pretty limited.  You can buy it but I would not be surprised if you have problems.

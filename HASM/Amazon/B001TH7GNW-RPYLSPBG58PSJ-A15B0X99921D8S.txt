Title: Phenomenal Equipment
Content:
I have being fulljoying the phenomenal quality of the Nikon D60 Gold Edition. Seriously I am in Jamaica and live in Jamaica and when i say "Di Ting Madddd!!!" i mean 'eeet sell offf'  I am in no quarrel about the Gold Edition whether or not gold is in it i love it. As a photographer and teacher i realize that quality is in demand and the D 60 has proven to be handy reliable and portable with its ease of use and access there is freedom in feeling when i take it up and use it . Though i dropped it and had to buy the new Nikon D90, i miss it some what but i got it fixed and the difference is far from felt. two great pieces of equipment and of the two the D60 is lighter  thus i travel with it more than the D90 which is a bit more weighty but both cameras have their own uncomparable qualities.
The D60 has what i call 'supa' endurance maybe its because i have extension battery packs on both cameras (D60 & D90) but i don't complain and wont complain. I recommend this camera for the enthusiast and hope that you not only commit to its loyalty but indulge your creativity try something new with it every day and become an explorer with the equipment... its worth nothing being just ordinary ... use your creative thoughts and revolutionize what you can do with the camera's ability to record your image. 
love it ...

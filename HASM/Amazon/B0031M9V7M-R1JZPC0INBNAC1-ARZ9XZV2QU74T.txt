Title: Laptop is great--Acer support is terrible
Content:
I've been using my 3810tz since July '09. It really is a nice laptop. Great size, decent performance. 
However, the laptop has been recalled because of an overheating risk due to a manufacturer's defect.
With Acer, I get the privilege of paying for my own packing materials to ship something I depend on for work and school for 7-10 days. When I called Acer Support to handle the repair, I asked if there was someone to complain to about how the recall was handled (a voucher for packing material and something else to show that they understand that their mistake is costing me at least a week of work).
Some companies with bad service will at least listen to your complaints before ignoring them.
Acer won't even listen.

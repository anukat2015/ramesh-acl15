Title: Not much of an "advance"
Content:
It was hard to decide on a rating.  The Nano is, in general, a great product, but I'm rating it here against the 3G Nano, which I consider better for music.  If you want to watch videos, then of course the 4G is better.  And the new glass cover for the screen is a big improvement.  That said....
First, the shuffle function is horrible.  It shuffles really badly, *much* less randomly than my 2G or 3G Nano.  Even worse, if you plug it in to recharge, it resets the shuffle.  On the 2G/3G, if you turned on the hold switch it would not reset the shuffle and you could just continue from where you were, even in the middle of a song.  This is a real issue for me because I like to shuffle the songs, then work through the entire playlist without any repeats.  With the new shuffle, I have to constantly skip songs I've recently heard.
I knew you could turn off the accelerometer, so I assumed that would turn it completely off, but it still remains operative for the cover flow.  This means if the Nano is tilted in your pocket you can't just reach in and adjust the volume.  You have make sure it's standing straight up or all you do is scroll through the covers.  It's a major hassle.  And the cover flow "feature" doesn't work very well, anyway.
The battery life is noticeably shorter than my old 2G/3G Nanos.  
Like others in the reviews, I'm going back to my 3G.  I sold it to a friend and I'm just going to offer to swap.  That should make him happy.  Although once I warn him about the problems he might not want to swap....

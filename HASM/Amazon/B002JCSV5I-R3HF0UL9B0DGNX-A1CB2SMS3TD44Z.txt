Title: Great Camera
Content:
I love this camera. It is fairly easy to use, I have never even read the manual for it. It has a great range of feature and pretty good picture quality. Its a pretty small camera and its nice and easy to carry. I love the huge display screen that makes it really easy to look at picture. Its fun to use and has a great range of settings to allow to go from almost all automatic making shots quick and easy to set up and take, to fully manual.

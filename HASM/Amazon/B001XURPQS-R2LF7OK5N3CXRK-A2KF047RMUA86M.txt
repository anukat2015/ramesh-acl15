Title: Don't buy this kit
Content:
Looks like I'm the first "one star". I'll be blunt. My old point and shoot, 6mp FujiFilm camera gave me better pictures. I spent an entire vacation using the T1i. Every possible shot from wide angle landscapes to low light portraits. Snap shots and photo shoots by the pool. Almost every shot was a bit fuzzy. I have read several reviews (professional and otherwise) about how the kit lens (18-55) is not very good, and you should get a different one. I am rating THIS KIT. The one I bought. If it's true that this combo is not very good and produces noticably bad pictures, how did this kit make it onto the market? 
I owned a Nikon FM 35mm for many years and then a Canon EOS 35mm for many years after that. I have no bias. I waited quite a few years to purchase a DSLR, until the price came down and quality came up.
Another marketing gimick is the 1080p HD. Prominent on the box. It's what swayed me to purchase the T1i, along with my confidence that Canon would give me a very good still DSLR. The 1080p only gives you 20fps. Standard video needs to be at least 24fps to give your eye the "video" effect of unbroken pictures. 30fps is desired to catch even moving objects. I tested this a few times and was very disappointed in the results. They were very jerky. And it did very poorly in low-light (incandescent) situations. Not that I was going to replace my camcorder, but this feature is definitely not worth influencing you to buy this camera. 
From all the research I've done since noticing how badly this camera performs, I have concluded the Nikon D90 is worth paying a bit more for. Here's the rub. You should probably not buy their kit either (but I have read that the 18-105VR lens is pretty good). You will always do better, quality-wise, buying the body only and then buying a well-reviewed lens that fits the type of photos you want to take.

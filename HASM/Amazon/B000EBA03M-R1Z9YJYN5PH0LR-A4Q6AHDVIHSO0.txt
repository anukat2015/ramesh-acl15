Title: An excellent camera at an excellent price.
Content:
I've had this camera for about 3 months now and I am still discovering new ways to take pictures. The camera has a bunch of functions that can test any photographers' creativity. 
Olympus has a bunch of software updates out for the camera. So check which version you have and get the update. The two lenses supplied in the package are really great for the price. I don't think you can get anything cheaper in terms of price especially for the quality a Zuiko lens provides.
Battery life is excellent - color renditions are 9.5/10. This camera competes directly with the Canon Digital Rebel XT (350D) and in my opinion beats it in many ways. The ergonomics are great, the camera sits nicely and is the righ size for a man's hand. The Rebel XT felt kind of small at the store. The supersonic wave filter and the 2 lens are the deal makers. If you are in a dusty environment, you'll like this feature.
The manual is average. The trigger, shutter sound are all very satisfying and sound just like an analog camera.

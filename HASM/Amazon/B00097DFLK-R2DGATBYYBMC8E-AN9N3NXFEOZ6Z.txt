Title: Dont waste your money
Content:
For its size and BTU rating I had expected much more from this unit. It is a pain to drain the collected condensed water tank, several times a day. It operates very warm, which makes this more of a heater and less of a cooling device. Even with the remove and clean filter a lot of dust still gets into the case, and instead of using standard philips screwdriver for the body they use several different head styles some of which are expensive. In addition, when i first got it, it did work but only if you stood in front of the vent, meaning that when it does work if you want to benefit from its use you have to sit in front of it. Bottom line, save your money and get a better one.

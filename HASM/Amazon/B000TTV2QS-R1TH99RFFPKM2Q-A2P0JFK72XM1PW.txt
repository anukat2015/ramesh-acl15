Title: Great heater
Content:
To make it short: Lasko offers great tower space-heaters. This one is very quiet. If you vacuume the back of it to remove the accumulated dust once or twice per season it works very well. What I like especially about this one is that you can change the heat by 1 degree Fahrenheit steps, not just by 5 degree steps.

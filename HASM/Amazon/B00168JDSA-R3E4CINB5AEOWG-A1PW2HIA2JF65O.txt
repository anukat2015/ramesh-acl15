Title: Looked good; being returned
Content:
This looked good "on paper" after I researched portable a/c's.
The one I have doesn't cool well, its being returned.  I made a test where it was on for several hours, and couldn't lower the temperature below 75, when it was only 80 out, but set to 66.  I expected to freeze, not be merely comfortable.  It won't be good enough for 90+ days.
There were missing parts to connect to the window outlet (I used duct tape workarounds to test), and Delonghi said the serial number indicated it was manufactured over a year ago, and suggested it may have been returned.  They seemed quite willing to send the parts...
The good; it looks made well, no cheezy parts.  No signs of the water bucket filling (which seems to happen dehumidify mode only), its relatively quiet.  It moves fairly easy on the rollers.  With separate air intake and output hoses, it should work better (but...).
Con; no side to side adjustment for airflow.  You seem to need to point the whole thing in a direction.  Its very big and heavy.  And it didn't cool well, but perhaps mine was returned by someone else.

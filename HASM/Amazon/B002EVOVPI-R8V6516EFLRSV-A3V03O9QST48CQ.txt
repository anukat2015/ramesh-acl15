Title: disappointed
Content:
I bought this Capresso coffee machine after my previous Capresso swing filter machine developed problems. I had been happy with my previous Capresso, so I thought the new machine would be as good or better than the old one, but I was sadly mistaken. 
First of all, the burr grinder in the new machine is very rough sounding, as though it was poorly made, whereas the old machine had a grinder that ran very smoothly and quietly. But the main reason for my disappointment is that the chute from the grinder to the filter basket clogs continually. After spending I don't know how much time cleaning the chute in the hope that it would finally work correctly, I finally gave up. Expecting a nice strong cup of coffee and ending up with nothing more than colored, or plain hot water is an exercise in frustration. Maybe the reason for the problem is that I use dark, Italian or French roast coffee which is pretty oily, but the fact remains that my coffee maker cannot cope with the beans - maybe it's a fluke, or maybe not.
 
If I can't get my money back on this uncooperative coffee machine, I'll just take it to the dump and forget about the money I lost. I would not recommend that you buy this product, especially if you use dark roasted beans for your coffee.

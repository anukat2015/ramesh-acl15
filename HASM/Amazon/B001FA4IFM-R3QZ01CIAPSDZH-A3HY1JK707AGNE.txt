Title: Great little heater, get it!
Content:
We needed a heater for my mom's room, and this one got good reviews, so I decided to get it. I see everyone complaining about the Thermostat and such, but it works great in my experience. You can set it to High or Low, or set it to High or Low with a set temperature. Also, if it gets knocked down quickly, the heater automatically shuts off, which is great for kids or pets. This little heater can heat up my whole living room and kitchen area. Granted, my house is probably smaller than some of yours, it's a single story with three bedrooms. However, this heater heat up my hallway, living room, and kitchen just fine. Highly recommended. It also has a nice coating on the grills of the heater to show when it's still hot. If it's orange, then it's hot. When it cools off, the orange fades away again.

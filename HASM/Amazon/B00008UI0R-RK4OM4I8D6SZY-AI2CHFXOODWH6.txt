Title: Super Suction!!!
Content:
We love our new Hoover Wind Tunnel.  This vacuum REALLY has suction and works great on picking up cat hair off our persian rugs.  The brush attachment also works great on wood floors.  Others have complained about emptying the waste container and cleaning the filter, but it's so easy a 5-year old could do it.  If you have a large home, it's possible you might have to empty the waste container before you're finished, but it takes less than a minute and is proof of all the stuff this baby picks up.  Highly recommended.

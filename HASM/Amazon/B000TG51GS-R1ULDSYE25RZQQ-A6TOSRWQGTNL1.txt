Title: Great heater for the money and great service from the seller!!1
Content:
I got my first DeLonghi MCH710T heater from another website and was very impressed with it's performance and value.  I used it to replace two smaller, but same wattage heaters that were getting older.  My parents were impressed with the output of the heater and asked me to locate a couple for them.  When I searched and found them for less money and extremely cheap shipping, they asked me to order three of them.  They now use one in the dining room, where they spend a lot of time and the other is used in the lobby of a small shop they own, to supplement the oil furnace and cut their heating costs.
The three heaters were shipped extremely fast, arriving in just a few days and well before the target date.  Each heater was in a carton, to protect it's original packaging.  The first heater I got from a different supplier, was just in it's original packaging and that was dented and dinged.  Luckily it wasn't damaged, but that was just luck.  In the case of the three I got through Amazon, it was attention to detail that kept the packages safe.
We are more than happy with the purchase, product and service...

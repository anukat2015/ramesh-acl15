Title: Electrolux el7020b
Content:
Just received this vac in the mail today, and so far, I think it's GREAT!  I have had such a rough time finding a good vac, and I think this might be it!  I had just cleaned my house yesterday with my old vacuum.  I got this one today, and just went over a couple of area rugs, and you should have seen how much it picked up.  Of course time will tell.  I had a hard time deciding which model to get, and I couldn't find alot of info.  The 7020b has a power carpet head, a large bare floor brush, an upholstery attachment, dusting brush, and crevice tool.  The on/off button seems sensitive, and I accidentally turned it off twice (it's on the handle), but I think I will get used to that and be more careful.  It came with two bags (one already installed), and the filter was in it.

Title: Great Laptop, WiFi problem with fix!!
Content:
I got this laptop a week ago. It is really fast, I had considered changing to XP due to the fact I had used Vista a few times and it had lackluster performance. I deceided to stick with the Vista-64, not a single complaint once you get used to the interface and it runs smoothly on the computer. My one complaint came yesterday, I had a big problem with the WiFi. It would not pick up my router, at first I thought it might be the router but after testing it with another computer I figured out it was the computer's wifi. After trying everything I fixed it doing the following: 
I uninstalled the driver for the wifi, and then installed the new drivers from intel: http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Product_Filter.aspx?ProductID=3062
This fixed the problem. Don't use the driver at Lenovo since it is out of date. Uninstalling the original driver may not be needed as well.
Hope you enjoy your laptop.

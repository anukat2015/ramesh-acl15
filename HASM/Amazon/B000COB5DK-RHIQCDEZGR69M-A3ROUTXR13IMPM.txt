Title: bull shit
Content:
i found a laptop for a cheaper price.  cancelled the laptop and some how got stuck with only a damn 3-year service plan.  my parents tryed cancelling it for me, because i am in the military and i got deployed.  i had no means of doing it my self.  but they told her she was giving the wrong information.  so if any one would like to help me i am back home awaiting a email response so i can get my money back for this service plan and NO notebook to go with it.
THANKS

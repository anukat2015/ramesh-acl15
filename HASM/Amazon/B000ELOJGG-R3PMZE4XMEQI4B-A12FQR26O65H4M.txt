Title: My room is now the ice cave, LOVE IT!
Content:
We bought this portable AC three years ago when it got so hot in Seattle.  The kids didn't understand why our bedroom was so cold, but they were so hot in their rooms.  We had campouts in mom's room during the really hot times.  We only use this seasonally (living in the NW), but each year when it comes upstairs out of the garage, it has fired up like nobody's business and my room is nice and cold.  We only have to empty the water about 1 time per season and I wouldn't trade mine.

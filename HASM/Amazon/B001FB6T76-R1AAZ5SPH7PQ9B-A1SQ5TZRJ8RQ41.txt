Title: Price is now within reason

While this is not a functional laptop due to its size it is also no desktop replacement due to its sluggishness. For someone like me who has the desire for a media based laptop and is not concerned with the weight, size or overclocking capability for gaming this is a sweet unit. I have used 64 bit ultimate vista now on both my desktop and this unit and have found it to be the best thing Mr. Gates and company have come up with; very stable and functional. The display is spectacular and the keyboard is one of the smoothest I've used. This is a very well put together machine with one of the very few drawbacks being a bunch of useless software to get rid of and I still do not understand why there is no OS disk included but I guess that is the way of the greedy corporate structure. Even though this is a discontinued model it is an excellent value for the dollar............

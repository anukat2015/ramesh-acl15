Title: No major complaints
Content:
Nice unit. I use aftermarket earbuds, stock ones were ok. The power on of switch is hard to get at with the rubber case/arm band cover on. The equalizer is worthless. Good bang for the buck, quality build and sound. Rotating dial wont rotate unless your finger is wet... so lick it and enjoy.

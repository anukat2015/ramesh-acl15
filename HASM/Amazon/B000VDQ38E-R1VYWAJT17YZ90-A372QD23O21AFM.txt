Title: Junk!
Content:
Piece of junk!  At first I was very impressed with the amount of hair (I own two golden retrievers) and dirt it picked up.  I thought the pet turbo brush that came with it worked really cool.  But the turbo brush quit working after only using it twice!  It seemed the more I used the vacuum the less suction it created.  I cleaned it frequently and found that I was constantly having to take the brush off to clean it.  Taking the canister off proved to be a very dirty mess.  You definitely needed to take the vacuum outside before taking the canister off to clean it.  But the bottom line was, the more I used this vacuum the less it pick up and the more it left behind!  I had to keep going over and over the same area but it kept leaving behind some of the littlest things.  Honestly, don't waste your money on this thing.

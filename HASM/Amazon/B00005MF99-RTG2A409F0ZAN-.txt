Title: Big Mistake
Content:
I made a big mistake when I bought this coffee maker.  I just returned it today after having it only 6 weeks.  The carafe leaks around the plastic rim and gets all over the counter and then when you place it back on the burner it leaks on it and the burner had started to rust after only 6 weeks of use.  I don't suggest this coffee maker to anyone.  I bought a Melitta this time and love it.

Title: Very happy
Content:
I needed a space heater for my bathroom.  My bathroom has high ceilings, slate tile floors, and there is no door that separates the bathroom from the bedroom.  So, there is a lot of open space.  Although the product should not be used in a bathroom because of the moisture, the open space prevents any moisture from building up.  I'm very pleased that the Lasko product warms my bathroom up before I take a shower.  I'm very careful with it, and I always unplug it after each use.  I may only have it on for 15 minutes, but it increases the temperature by about 5 degrees in that time.  It's just enough to take the chill out.

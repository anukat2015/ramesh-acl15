Title: A great camera
Content:
Long battery life, crisp digital previews, and of course, great pictures.  The shutter is FAST, especially if you are used to a fully-digital device.  The transistion from automatic to manual focus is simple.  If you are a serious gearhead and you want intuitive full manual control in a digital SLR, get the upgrade - this camera is great for the amateur shutterbug.

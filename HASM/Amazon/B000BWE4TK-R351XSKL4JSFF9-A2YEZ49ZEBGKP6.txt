Title: What Lens for the D50?
Content:
Since so many have commented favorably on the camera, I will instead share my thinking on a lens for the D50.  I had read a review in dpreview.com that the packaged lenses were OK but those interested in sharper images should seek a higher quality lens.  I also know that every time you change a lens, you risk dust getting inside the camera and onto sensor, marring every subsequent image. So I looked for a very sharp lens with a wide zoom range which will allow me to keep it on the camera from portraits to wildlife to landscapes.  There are a number out there but I settled on the Nikkor 18-200MM ED AF DX VR.  This is a fabulous lens, compact, very fast focussing and nearly distortion free.  Normally, you can't hand-hold a 200MM lens but this one has an electronic image stabilzer, allowing tack sharp hand-held images at telephoto range.  The big drawback is price: the lens cost more than the D50.  My reasoning for paying such a high price may be off-beat to some, but makes sense to me.  I think the new entry -level digital SLR's by Nikon and others are all very capable and well priced.  Match one with a sharp, wide-ranging zoom lens and you've got a compact combination which will stretch your photographic creativity.

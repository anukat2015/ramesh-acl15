Title: Best coffee maker I've ever owned!
Content:
I find it hard to believe anyone has a negative thing to say about this one.  I've tried many different brands of coffee makers in the past and this one far surpasses any of the others!  Great coffee and great features!  I've seen a few people complain there isn't enough room to pour the water, this took me about 2 days to get used to and I have to say I am picky about things like this.  I liked this Cuisinart so much that I bought one for my mother.  She won't stop thanking me for it.  I own the black one and it looks very stylish on the counter.  I can't think of one negative thing to say about it.

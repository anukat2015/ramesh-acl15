Title: The fan is great, the mister is not
Content:
This is a well made product that creates a lot of air movement and is quiet at the same time.  The mister, however, disappoints.
The product comes in a big, fairly heavy box and requires assembly.  The parts fit well and the quality is good.  Count on 30-45 minutes assembly time with common household tools.  The inclusion of a cover is a nice touch.
The mist head is more of a shower head.  The nozzle orifices are so large that they do not create mist, they create rain.  Even from fifteen feet away, we found ourselves soaked rather than cooled.
I am told that the fan is sometimes sold without the mister.  If so, you probably want to choose that one and save yourself a few dollars and some wet clothing.

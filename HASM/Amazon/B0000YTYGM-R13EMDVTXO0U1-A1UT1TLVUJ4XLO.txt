Title: Perfomed as expected
Content:
We have used many coffee maker brands over the last 45 years and have been pleased with previous cuisinart makers. This one is no different.It has perfomed as expected and we have had no problems from day one.Before purchase,we read reviews of leaking etc.,but believed it was improper set up.The coffee stays hot and tastes good.We expect some energy savings as we will not  be running a hot plate to keep it hot.

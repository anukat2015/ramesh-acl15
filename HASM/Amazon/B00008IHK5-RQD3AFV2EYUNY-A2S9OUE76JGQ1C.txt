Title: A REAL BARGAIN.   HOWEVER ...
Content:
Not only is this a cool looking coffeemaker, it's simple to use and makes a tasty pot of coffee.  I particularly enjoy being able to program it to brew and shut off at pre-selected times.  Buying the reconditioned item is a real bargain at about 1/3rd the cost of a brand spankin' new one.
However, if you're at all squeamish, keep in mind that it may have been used and then returned to the manufacturer prior to being reconditioned.  I had to give mine a thorough cleaning to remove coffee grinds from the interior and coffee stains from the burner.  It also has a small dent on the side, which isn't very noticeable.
5 YEARS LATER ...
And my coffeemaker is still going strong. I accidentally broke the glass carafe a few months ago, and was able to order a replacement on Amazon.com -- arrived within a week.

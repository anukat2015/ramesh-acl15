Title: Great Product for a Tea Lover like me
Content:
I do not drink coffee so the Melitta was the only pod machine I considered since it is the only one currently selling tea pods.  I previously was using an electric kettle to boil water then steeping it - since I like very dark tea.  I figured the One:One would help me save a step since it would heat and steep at essentially the same time.  I am very pleased.
To address the concerns I have seen others raise:
*I have had not trouble with leaking from the Pods or the well.  I understand if you place the pods in incorrectly it will cause leaking so be careful.  
*The temperature is cooler than if you boil the water in a kettle or a microwave.  So if you like your drinks scalding, this will not work for you.  If you usually take the scalding cup and let it sit, then this will be fine.  You'll be able to drink it right away.

Title: Warm but extremely noisy
Content:
I was disappointed in this product and returned it because it runs with a fan which is extremely noisy. Also nowhere on the packaging description did it note that there was a fan. I slept horribly with the fan cycling on and off, the air becoming very dry, and the unit elements turning bright orange. On the upside, the room became warm in a short period of time. [EDIT: The 307 version (white) also runs on a fan.]

Title: MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY!
Content:
We thought long and hard before spending this much money for a vacuum. But, the rave reviews on MANY websites finally convinced us to buy the Miele S5281 Pisces vacuum.  We had gone through several other vacuums, costing $300-$400 each, all of which met with a seemingly early demise.  We are definitely not hard on vacuums and probably don't run them often enough!
The Miele vacuum is everything we thought it would be and more.  It is about 1/2 the weight of our old vacuum and the design of the wheels make it VERY easy to pull around.  The non-electric rug brush works very well, without pulling threads out of our rugs (like our old vacuum did).  The parquet twister floor brush is a delight to use and allows access to many small areas we were unable to reach with our old vacuum.  Our whole-house vacuuming time has been reduced about 30% by not having to continually change to small brushes for reaching those areas.
But, the BEST thing about the Miele is how VERY quit it is.  We used to have to wear hearing protection with our other vacuum.  The Miele is VERY quiet, even on its highest suction setting and just a whisper on the lowest setting.  
Yes, the Miele line of vacuums is expensive.  But, as with most things, you get what you pay for.  They have well thought out designs and are built to last.  If your budget will allow, you will NOT regret purchasing one of their vacuums.

Title: Love it!
Content:
I absolutely love this product.  From the very first pot we have had great coffee.  No problems with grinding or brewing, and I have no problem cleaning the parts after each use.  I did it with my regular coffee brewer and separate grinder so it isn't any more work.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves coffee!

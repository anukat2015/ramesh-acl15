Title: What a piece of junk
Content:
It's A PIECE OF JUNK  "BUYER BEWARE"  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE  IT'S A PIECE OF JUNK
I received it and I charged it up. I downloaded about 30 movies on it. I go to play one of my favorite flick's and it tells me that I need a widget to play it. So I order the widget from Archos. It cost $30.00 . I download it and install it. It still don't work. I played with this piece of junk for a week trying to make it work, and still it tells me that I need a mpeg widget to play movies. What did I just pay for. 
                             "BUYER BEWARE"!!!
After a week of screwing around I gave up and put it back in the box and put it where the junk that I have bought that don't work as promoted to. I bought this brick for $200.00 & have spent about another $200.00 trying to get to work, to no avail. Would I recommend it to somebody else, "ABSOLUTELY NOT". Save your money and buy a 32gbt ONDA 7" Monster. It cost $169.00 and works right out of the box, and you don't need to buy widgets. The Archos is back in the box, And the Onda is on my night stand.

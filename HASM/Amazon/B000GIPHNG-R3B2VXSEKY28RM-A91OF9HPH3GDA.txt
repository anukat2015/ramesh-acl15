Title: Better Than My SANSA!
Content:
I had one of these and lost it at the gym. In a panic, I went a bought a Sansa Media Player...which I can't stand and after two weeks, decided to purchase this one again. 
The principal reason? I listen to a lot of techno/dance/circuit music. Sony's software doesn't put in a "soft blank" where one track ends and another begins, as does Windows Media software, even when you reduce cross-fading. When you're running or working out, I want my music constant, seamless, as it was intended to be heard. 
Another reason I like this product is the long battery life. It seems as if I have to recharge the Sansa every two days. With Sony, it's more like two weeks. 
While I haven't received the merchandise as of this date, I have no doubt I'll be pleased with it.

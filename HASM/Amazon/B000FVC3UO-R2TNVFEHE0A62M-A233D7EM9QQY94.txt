Title: Not worth your money
Content:
I bought this heater to go under my desk at work. While the turn knob is simple and is suppose to allow various settings, I have not had the experience of enjoying any settings. The heater shuts off within a minute. It doesn't matter what temperature I set it at. It will not go back on unless I unplug the heater and let it sit for 5 min. I think my co-workers have seen me under my desk fidgeting with the heater more than actually up at my desk doing work. I will definitely be returning it.

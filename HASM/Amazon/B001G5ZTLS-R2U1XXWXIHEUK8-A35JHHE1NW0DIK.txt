Title: A great camera with improved movie mode
Content:
I won't write a long review because others have obviously already done that on here. After using this camera for professional video shoots and photo shoots, I have to say I've never once been let down. I was disappointed that the video mode didn't allow full functionality, but now that Canon has updated the firmware to fix that problem, this is the ultimate camera for shooting film-like movies and commercial projects on a small budget. Sure there are better cameras out there, but probably not many that can shoot in low light in video mode and still get a great image. In other words, if you're a photographer, get this camera...if you're a film maker who doesn't have 40k for a red one, get this camera.

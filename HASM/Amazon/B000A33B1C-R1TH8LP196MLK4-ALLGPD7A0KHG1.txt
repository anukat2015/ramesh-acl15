Title: Consistent Heat
Content:
I just love the oil filled radiator!  I use this to supplement my fuel-oil hot-water baseboard heat in my bedroom.  This works great in a 13' x 15' (195 aq ft) room.  I'm sure if I cranked it up, it would be able to tackle a larger room.  It provides consistent heat for the time period I have pre-set on the timer.  The timer is a little tricky to figure out, but once you do..you set it and forget it.  Very simple!

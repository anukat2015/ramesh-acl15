Title: Great little heater
Content:
I bought this heater to heat the underside of my bed, My bed has a captain stand with a sheet of plywood over then the foam mattress on top. There was moisture building up between the mattress and the plywood because of the cold from the wall and floor and no air circulation because of the Captain stand being completely enclosed. I know it is not recommended to use in very confined space, but that is what I needed it for and that is the safest heater to use for something like that. It is small and very safe and I do not have to crawl under the bed to turn in on and off. It works fantastically and I am enormously pleased with it. I have it on extremely low and it heats just enough to keep things dry.

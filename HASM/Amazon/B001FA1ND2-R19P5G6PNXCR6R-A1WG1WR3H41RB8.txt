Title: Intuitive, fast, and has everything I need.
Content:
I bought this product for my mom, who is not tech savvy at all. She wanted something that would play music, audiobooks, videos, picture slides, and the radio. I was going to buy her an iRiver clix2 for the radio functionality, but decided against it because of its non-intuitive syncing and use format (I have one). I was worried that she'd get confused and frustrated with the product and never use it.
It turns out that the podcasts more than make up for no radio functionality. Although syncing anything to the iPod was confusing for mom when she tried it by herself, it took me a few minutes to figure iTunes out (never used it before) and a total of about an hour to teach her how to use iTunes to sync everything she wanted to the iPod.
The accelerometer is kind of cool, but not really necessary (I suppose unless you play games, which my mom doesn't) and is a bit of a gimmick. The screen is pretty large and colors are very crisp and clear.
The aluminum, yellow-colored shell is a really pretty, bright and sunny color, but not so bright that it hurts the eyes to look at and the 16GB capacity gives a lot of room for error in syncing what you want versus what you don't want (great for my mom, who still seems to be downloading and syncing random podcasts to see what programs she likes). 
The quality and capabilities of this product makes me wish I had joined the iPod crowd instead of the iRiver crowd, but guess it's too late now.

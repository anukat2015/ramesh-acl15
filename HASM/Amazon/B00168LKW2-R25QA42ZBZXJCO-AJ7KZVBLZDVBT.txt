Title: WARNING*** Do Not Buy This
Content:
***BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK***
I purchased this DeLonghi PAC A120E a year ago when my wife and I needed a stand up air conditioner unit. I should have read the reviews here because it started leaking water all over our carpet and hardwood floor. This unit has been in operation for 3 months and it has broken down and has ruined a 150 dollar carpet.  I have tried to contact the customer service for DeLonghi but it is useless. The nearest service center is 75 miles away from my house and is NOT open on weekends. The company does not pay for shipping or send a technician out. DeLonghi is unwilling to help or provide any kind assistance in this matter. Why should they? They already got paid. Our local repair shop will not touch these units and will cost about 200 dollars to replace the part. Please keep in mind this unit is still in warrantee.  We are left with a VERY EXPENSIVE PIECE OF JUNK (a  700 dollar piece of junk). They say it is NOT their policy to ship or pay for shipping to their service center. Its a great scam.   If I could give this product a negative number I would. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I will NEVER buy a DeLonghi product again. I just want to reiterate what an absolute inconvienece this is. It is the hottest week of the summer and my thermostat has reached 93 in my living room. So, thanks DeLonghi for that. I'm sweating as I type this and I bet your CEO is sitting somewhere very cool and perspiration free. 
PS. I am not exaggerating and have not had any previous problems with DeLonghi, but they have been awful to deal with.

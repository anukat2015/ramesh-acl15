Title: A Flawed Product
Content:
This cleaner has great suction, it's ergonomically designed, the HEPA filters are washable--which simplifies cleaning, and the revolving brush on the rug attachment really is effective.  That said, it's been a nightmare.  I think the electronic control on the handle that is attached to the hose is the culprit--the replacement part sells for $160.  After it was replaced once by the Hoover company because the revolving brush stopped revolving, it again died within a year. The second time the brush kept revolving but the suction stopped and the control buttons stopped working so the only way to turn it off was to pull the plug. The Hoover company said it warrants replacement parts for 90 days and declined to offer any relief other than selling me the failed part.  OK, the cleaner is out of warranty, but before you spend money on this vacuum spend some time looking at alternatives.  I'll never purchase another Hoover product.

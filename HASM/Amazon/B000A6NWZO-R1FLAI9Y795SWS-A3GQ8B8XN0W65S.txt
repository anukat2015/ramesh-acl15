Title: A great product that really works
Content:
I had heard so many people mention the protable air units do not work, but this one lives up to what it says it does. 
The key is having the dual hoses to blow out the hot air.
I love the hourly schedule mode you can put in as well as the fan feature.
We have this in an upstairs bonus room that used to stay hot. It works great! I would highly recommend in bonus, garage and sunrooms! Great work on this unit.
The only drawback is the noise factor, but for a portable unit, it's not that bad.

Title: Hunter Thermostats are an excellent addition to our home
Content:
I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my home thermostats.  I can already see the savings in my electricity bill.  The Hunter 44550 provides excellent flexibility to maximize electrical savings for my home.  I have begun to track our system usage while continuing to modify both of our air-conditioning systems, maintaining our family's comfort while providing greater efficiency.  They were easy to set up and are easy to use.  I am 100 % satisfied with both of my thermostats.

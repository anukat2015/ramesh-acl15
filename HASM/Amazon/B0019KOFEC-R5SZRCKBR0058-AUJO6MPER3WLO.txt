Title: Great Vac, but get ready to replace the hose in a few months
Content:
I purchased this vac on-line in Jan 2009.  It works great!  Good suction, and the pet-hair attachment is a wonderful accessory.  The hose that attaches to the vacuum, however, is a very cheap all-plastic hose and will break down from being bent while vacuuming.  I had to replace the hose six months into the purchase.  Eureka replaced it under warranty, but I am sure I will have to do this again in another few months and will have to pay for the hose this time.  We own an upright Eureka vac cleaner as well.  The hose on that has a steel spiral built into it and will outlast the vac cleaner itself.  But this one has a very cheaply made hose and will cost you money in the long run.

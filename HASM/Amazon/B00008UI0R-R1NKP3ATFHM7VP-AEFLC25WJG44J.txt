Title: Good value, Good looks
Content:
I needed a petite vacuum for oak and tile floors, this one works like a dream, is easy to carry, maneuvers around obstacles without 'dragging' and had not scratched my floors.
Suction is good, hair pick up is adequate, and the bagless option is great for a vacuum of this size.  Minibags cost way too much!

Title: It is Great for What I need
Content:
For the size and price this is a great little heater.  I am a Licensed Esthetician and I purchased it to heat a bathroom for clients when they have a tub soak after a body polish.  It is just perfect for what I need.  The only drawback is if you need to heat a bigger space--it isn't that powerful--but I think it even said that in the description.  Great little heater for smaller spaces.

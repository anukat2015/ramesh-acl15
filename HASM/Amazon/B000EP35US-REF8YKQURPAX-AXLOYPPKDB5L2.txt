Title: 150 for 2GB novid????
Content:
Why the heck is apple so good? How come after 2 years of telling myself that a better version is comming of the ipod nano and three weeks after I buy the ipod nano 2GB a ipod w/ video 4GB comes out for the same price. I goes to show you how much profit apple makes with their products... I bet a 2nd generation nano 2GB couldn't be worth more than 70$! apple makes us pay twice the price!

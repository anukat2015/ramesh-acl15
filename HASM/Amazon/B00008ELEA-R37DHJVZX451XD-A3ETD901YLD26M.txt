Title: Very  bummed:(
Content:
Bought it for myself for Christmas, went to use it and found that the top is so tight and hard to take off I had to practically tackle it.  Needless to say I knew right away I didn't want to struggle with a coffee pot and never used it.  Decided to send it right back.  It appears nice and sturdy, well made too, perhaps I just got a bumm one but I'm not trying another.

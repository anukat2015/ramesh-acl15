Title: Best designed and built cannister vacuum cleaner.
Content:
I have a 1000 sq ft Condo remodeled with high quality laminates-no carpeting. So what I needed was something for my wood floors and area rugs. I have used many different vacuums over the years, and as a quality engineer by profession, I believe there is not a better vacuum out there. Many excellent/surprise features, very easy to use, very light weight, and very powerful. My girlfriend bought a top of the line Sears several months ago and is absolutely jealous. The fact that this is a bagless unit, was a major consideration and has already saved me money. If someone stole this from me, I would buy another tomorrow!

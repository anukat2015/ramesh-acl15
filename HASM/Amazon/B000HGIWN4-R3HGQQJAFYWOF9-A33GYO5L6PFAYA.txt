Title: Bait and Switch
Content:
This is not a review of the camera, but of a vendor.  On Time Digital is a horrible company to deal with.  They put one price on their web page and tell you another when you call to place the order.  The say that they have a USA body Nikon D80 for 330 dollars. It would be nice if they would honor the price they advertise.  I guess it is true, there is no honor among thieves.  I would/will stay away from this company.  The camera, I will still try to purchase elsewhere.

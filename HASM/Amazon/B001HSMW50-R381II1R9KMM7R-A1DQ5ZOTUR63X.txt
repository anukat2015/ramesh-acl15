Title: Product has poor design
Content:
I have the SDC740 model and have had the same problem of the caraffe not sitting properly and exerting enough pressure to properly activate the basket spring - thus causing coffee to overflow on counter. In researching I found that the old product number of ODC740 had this problem and had been recalled. The new product has the same problem.
I contacted Black & Decker today by phone & they are sending out a new basket unit, but it is on backorder so it will be a couple of weeks before replacement basket is shipped. I've thought about working on the spring (cutting it down) or taping the lever - but that really defeats the purpose of the sneak-a-peak feature which should perform properly on the appliance. 
Other than the overflow issue, I am pleased with the coffee maker. This is the 4th under-the-counter Black and Decker coffeemaker that I've owned and the first to have given me a problem. The others died a natural death after years of use.

Title: Great for tea bags or one cup coffee bags
Content:
I bought this to replace my old black n decker.  The only good thing about the black n decker was that it included a metal cup.  The hamilton beach breverage center is great with only one minor thing.  The measuring tray is a great idea but I can never get the same amout of water in the tray. I really like the looks.  It doesn't look like a coffe maker, people are unsure what is for at first.  Great for the price.

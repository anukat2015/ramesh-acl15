Title: excellent cappuccino for few $$$
Content:
Don't listen to the coffee snobs who say you need to spend hundreds (or more) for a good cappuccino machine!  I didn't get a machine for a long time because I figured they would be too complicated to use, time-consuming to clean, and the inexpensive ones would make lousy cappuccino.  But Starbucks gets expensive, so when I saw this one on sale for $59.99 I figured all it needed to do was make 20 decent drinks to pay for itself.  It has done that in a couple of weeks!  Following the instructions, it's very easy to use, cleaning is also quick and easy, and the cappuccinos and lattees come out great.  It's a huge plus that you can use regular coffee mugs, so who cares that it doesn't come with little espresso cups?  The ONLY negative is that it really should have come with a milk frothing pitcher, but I picked up an 8-oz. one at the supermarket for $1.99 and it works fine.  If you are on the fence about whether or not to take the plunge on an inexpensive espresso/cappuccino maker, buy this one.

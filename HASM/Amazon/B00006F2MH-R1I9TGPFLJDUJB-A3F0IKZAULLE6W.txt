Title: Faulty Design and no customer service
Content:
Yes, this coffee maker, if you meticulously clean it and put the handle of the filter basket just so, and make sure the grinds draw is locked, and don't put in too much coffee will make a decent cup.  But...this thing is poorly designed and Cuisart offers no customer service.  We've had morning disasters with coffee running out behind the pot all over the kitchen, and I'm talking hot coffee.  
As others have stated, there are many parts to clean.  Unlike a traditional coffee grinder, this one gets wet from the humidity of the brewing coffee, so you cannot just wipe it out.  It must be thoroughly washed and dried.  The worst part is the filter basket.  The sliding mechanism gets gunked up by grounds and it is impossible to get in there and clean it.  To do it at all well you have to unplug the thing so you don't electrocute yourself, and then when done you have to reprogram the coffee maker all over again. 
I've e-mailed Cuisinart for guidance and gotten no response, not to mention that their web-site is designed to make it practically impossible to correspond with them.  The concept of this machine is great, but the execution of it is really bad.  I've had to hold my husband off from dumping the whole thing in the garbage, which we will when we find a suitable replacement.
I expect better from Cuisinart and the fact that they continue to sell this model which has so many problems tells you alot about this company.

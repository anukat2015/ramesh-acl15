Title: You're looking at a time bomb.
Content:
I've been using this heater for a year and a few days ago I was so surprised to find the power plug is bent.
And I tested it letting it run for 10 minutes with a full throttle then the power plug got ridiculously hot and that caused the bent plug.
If I found this defect a few months later, I'd have a burnt house.

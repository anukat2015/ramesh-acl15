Title: Love this Coffee Machine
Content:
It seems that in NYC is very hard to find the 1-4 cup coffee machine. I wanted a smaller coffee machine for quite sometime and I couldn't find one. My daughter gave me one last year as a Christmas gift, but the smallest she found was an 8 cup one. I like the Mr. Coffee brand and the programmable feature. I wake up in the morning with the smell of freshly brewed coffee coming from the kitchen. This one works dilligently, like a little maid.

Title: Awesome player
Content:
I moved up from a Zen Vision to this X-FI model.  I have to say I'm very impressed with this player.  Transferring files were much faster than with the Zen vision.  This is definitely an IPod killer - no comparison.  The screen is amazingly clear and the colors are very accurate.  I've got large thumbs and did not find the buttons to be small as others say they have.  Response was much faster than I've seen on other players.  The X-FI really restores the sound.  The cymbals and the bass return in this player.  32gbs of storage and a 2.5 inch screen in a credit card size is as good as it gets.  I would highly recommend this player to anybody.

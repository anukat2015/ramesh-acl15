Title: Mr Coffee just Average
Content:
I was excited to have one machine to make espresso and coffee in a compact size at a reasonable price. Be warned - you get what you pay for. We have had the machine about three months now and we are starting to have some issues with it. The espresso carafe is cracked and it was never dropped or mishandled. The cost to replace it is outrageous. In general, it takes 20 minutes to brew a full pot of coffee and the temperature is never consistent. The coffee pot spills everywhere when you pour due to the venting on the lid. It is pretty easy to clean. But the whole design is odd/poor overall. I am not very pleased with it as a whole. I will not buy another one of these. I will buck up and buy a more expensive one with better features.
Just an update. The coffee maker suddenly stopped working completely. We cleaned it repeatedly on a regular basis and have no idea what the problem is. The espresso make still works. I pulled out the old Cuisinart and it works like a charm, even at five years old. You really do get what you pay for. After we get back from vacation, I will be looking for a higher quality dual machine that will hopefully last more than three months. Buyer beware.

Title: iPOD Shuffle 1g 2nd Generation
Content:
I llke it.  The sound quality is excellent but the only draw back is its' design versus the headphones.  They get in the way and should have had a better design to account for head phones and an easier protection system to protect the device.  But it does what it is suppose to do ... play high quality sound.

Title: The Best Camera for a Serious Photo-Dog
Content:
This camera is so hard to find any fault with. It's build quality, handling, sensor, metering and fast autofocus are first-rate and it does not require coddling. The only reason not to get one is if you belong to the Church of Canon instead of the Church of Nikon. It's also a tremendous value and has all the latest wireless options- a best buy you'll not regret! I highly recommend the new Nikkor 17-55mm AF-S DX f/2.8 G ED zoom for a versatile setup from "wide angleness" to low light performance.

Title: Good system.
Content:
I really didn't know what to expect from this portable unit but I was excited to try it out.  I have to honestly say that I'm very happy with it's performance.  Easy to set up and easy to use.  I must warn you not to use the machine in an areas that you can not section off and you must follow the manufactures recommendations because like any other a/c system (central or window)it will not work optimally if it's not used correctly.  Enjoy the cool air!

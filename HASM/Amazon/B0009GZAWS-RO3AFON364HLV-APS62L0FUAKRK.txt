Title: Mediocre product
Content:
Easy to use, no frills camera - features that suit me just fine. The problem with this one is that shooting in automatic mode produces poor images. I was hoping this camera would replace my point and shoot. I was wrong.
Problems i ran into in full auto mode:
1. When shooting outdoors colors are very pale (overexposed).
2. Poor contrast outdoors.
3. Sharpness is very low.
Seems if you want good pics you need to go into settings and set every scene individually. Why include full auto mode when it delivers nothing but terrible results? I do not recommend this camera.

Title: Simple to use!
Content:
Great for the working person.  I would highly recommend this thermostat if you love waking to a warm house.  I have it set to come on for an hour before the alarm goes on, and off right after I get out of the shower.  Great money saver since I used to leave the heat on higher all night not to wake cold.  It was easy to install. My boyfriend did it, but had it completed in minutes.  Only draw back is, it's programmable for Monday thru Friday.  Not sure why I can't get Saturday and Sunday to show since the instruction book show it.  Since I'm there to manually adjust on the weekend, it's not the much of an issue.

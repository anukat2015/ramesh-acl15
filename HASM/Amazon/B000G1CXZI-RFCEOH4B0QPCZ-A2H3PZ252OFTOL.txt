Title: Works great and saves money
Content:
We've had this heater for almost 2 months and so far it has worked as advertised. Our apartment gas heater was out of order until today, but we haven't really missed it with this heater and our older > 20 year old DeLonghi heater. The ability to use it in the bathroom is a real plus. It's lightweight and easy to carry around if necessary.
Some of the problems mentioned by other reviewers included: turns off by itself (fix is to change the timer settings) and smell when turned off in highest setting (we didn't turn it to the highest for over a month but when we did we didn't notice a strong smell).
Overall, very happy with this little heater.

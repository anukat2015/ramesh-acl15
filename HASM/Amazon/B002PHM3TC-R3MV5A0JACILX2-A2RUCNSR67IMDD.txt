Title: Nice machine, horrible support
Content:
I just received this a few days ago. It's an AS1810T.  It seems like a great product, although I haven't used it much because I'm not sure if I will have to return it.  The problem is that the fan runs constantly when plugged in, and although it's not really loud, it's just loud enough to be annoying.  The moment I unplug it, the fan becomes totally silent.  I would like to have it plugged in while at home in order to get the increased performance.
I've been trading emails for 5 days with customer support at Acer (there is no such thing as a telephone number to call)and they are totally brain dead.  I've asked 4-5 times if the fan should be running 100% of the time when it's plugged in, and they keep evading the question, and are giving me advice like "unplug the keyboard and mouse", "check to see if any peripheral devices are noisy"  etc.  I'm really angry at this point and not sure if I will keep the machine.
The other thing that's a bigger factor than I thought is the glossy finish on the case.  Looks good when freshly polished, but it looks really smudgy the rest of the time, almost like you were eating french fries and then wiped your hands on the case.

Title: Best MP3 player out in the market
Content:
i just got mine last week so i'll just try to list some pros and cons
Pros 
- the screen is more crisp and clear, just wonderful compared to the iPod video (this is proof now that the images in the early reviews that the pics for Creative ARE NOT saturated to make them look better)
- sound quality is also better, this coming from Creative so for sure
- the earbuds were the most surprising thing, they sound fantastic.  I never realised how bad the ipod earbuds were until today(i am a former 3rd G ipod owner) when i walked into an Apple store and did a comparison in the store, then switched it with the Creative ones. The ipod ones don't isolate the sound as well and it lacks bass, as if it isn't there unless you use the EQ, whereas the Creative ones have a nice bass and a fresh clear sound. Even on the same volume the creative ones are considerably louder
- 4 hours of video so you can actually watch a whole movie and still have some battery left over to listen to music
- 15 hours of audio life, Creative website says 14hrs but on reviews by Cnet on test, it was actually 15 hours.
- though bulkier than the ipod video, the size makes it easier to hold, IMO the size is perfect, it's exactly the same as my 3rd Generation iPod with a silicon case
- FM radio, great addition if you wanna just listen to the radio sometimes, i do
Cons
- Internal battery so you can't personally remove it
- the verticle scroll is a little too sensitive, being a former ipod user, it takes a bit of getting use to
- buttons are a bit stiff at first, but i notice as time goes by it's easier to press
- no "on the go playlist" like the ipod, if there is i haven't found out how to do it yet
i give this product a 9/10, however because of some very biased reviews giving 0 or 1, i am bumping this up for a 5/5

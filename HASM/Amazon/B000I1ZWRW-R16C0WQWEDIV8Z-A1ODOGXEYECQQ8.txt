Title: Best Entry Level Digital SLR Keeps Getting Better
Content:
The third generation XTi is the successor to the popular Rebel XT. An entry level camera but considered to be quite an excellent performer in many levels.
It comes with a battery and a sleek compact charger. It also uses the well known Digic II image processor.  Uses CF card. 
Improvements compared to its older brother XT:
- 10 megapixel resolution compared to 8 megapixel for the XT
- A larger 2 1/2 inch LCD panel compared to 1.8 inch
- A new self-cleaning sensor
- 9 point AF system while the XT has 7
- Better burst shooting capacity from 23 to 27 frames 
- 7 LCD brightness levels compared to 5 for better viewing in bright surroundings
Pros: 
- Image quality is superb. Color rendition and low-noise
- Light and small 
- Can shoot RAW format
- Impressive long battery life.
Cons:
- Cannot shoot using the LCD panel. You always have to use the viewfinder. LCD is for menu and playback only.
- Supplied lens is very basic. No image stabilizer. Slow.
- No movie capability

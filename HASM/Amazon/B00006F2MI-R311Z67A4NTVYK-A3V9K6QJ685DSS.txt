Title: Like the coffee so much I'll put up with a lot
Content:
We have used our machine for over two years now and we have discovered more ways than you can imagine to screw up and make a huge mess with it. Don't check to see if the door is latched tight....coffee and grounds everywhere. Forget to put the lid on the carafe.....coffee and grounds everywhere. Forget to empty the carafe (since its stainless you can't tell by looking) and coffee everywhere. These are the ways that I can remember off-hand. 
HOWEVER, when we went to the beach for Thanksgiving, we took this coffee maker with us because we have been spoiled since it does make the best coffee. As far as not keeping the coffee hot, it works better than any carafe I've come across and I do not like coffee that has been sitting on a heater for hours. The carafe does tend to drip a bit when pouring, but not badly if the lid is screwed on properly. The grider mechanisim, baskets and carafe can all be put in the dishwasher so I don't know what the cleaning problems may be. 
You need to order a couple of the replacement charcoal filters as well since they are not easy to find.

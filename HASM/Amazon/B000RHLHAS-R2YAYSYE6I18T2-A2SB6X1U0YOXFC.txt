Title: Works Fine
Content:
I use my heater in a upstairs bedroom that I use as my computer room and it gets 5-10 degree's colder than the downstairs.Since I only need this room for short periods, this little heater warms up the room in 10 minutes or less & I just shut it off when I leave. The remote is nice.

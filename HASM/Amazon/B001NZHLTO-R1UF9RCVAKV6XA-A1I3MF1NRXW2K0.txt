Title: You'll Enjoy Vacuuming! (Maybe.)
Content:
Length:: 5:45 MinsI wrote a lengthy review of this vacuum for my website (feel free to check it out if you want -- see video for URL), but for Amazon I'll summarize it: this is a great vacuum. I haven't had experience with other Miele models, but if this thing is any indication, Miele makes a line of excellent machines. Here is a quick rundown of SOME (but not all) of the advantages and disadvantages of this unit:
Pros:
+Excellent filtration (as good as it gets)
+Quieter than any vacuum I've ever heard
+Low ground clearance
+Well designed/engineered in pretty much every aspect (I love the cord winder, wheels, bags, auto-shutoff, etc!)
+Looks really slick while still subdued (doesn't scream "I'm a Dyson!")
Cons:
-Typical disadvantages of being a canister vac. Sometimes difficult to maneuver around corners/doors, sometimes a pain trying to reposition hose.
-Attaching/detaching certain tools and the wand itself can be a little awkward at times
-Price is steep!
The bottom line is that if you can afford it, you absolutely can't go wrong with this vacuum (or presumably any Miele). I give it 5 stars because, while not *perfect*, it certainly is the best vacuum I've ever seen or used...and by a landslide. 
Note: If you have carpet, I'd recommend any model in the S5 line (except the Pisces, which doesn't include a powered brush head). For primarily hard floors, any of the Miele models should meet your needs.

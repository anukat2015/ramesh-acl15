Title: Not so good Zune
Content:
Purchased the Zune 4gb as a gift for my son. About three months of use the battery starts to drain fast until it stopped working completely. I registered the device for warranty service only to find the 1 year warranty is over... on a device I purchased three months ago from Amazon.
Contacted Microsoft Support on this and spoke with someone in India, I think. They are sending (well actually emailing) a packing label so I can print it out and tape it to a box that I have to provide and mail to them.  I was also advised that if there are any kind of scratches at all on this device that warranty service will not be made. So that's just peachy. Hoping that they will actually fix it but there is the tiniest of scratches on the back. I will never buy another Microsoft device again that's for sure. Not to mention the out of warranty items that Amazon is passing off.

Title: New DSLR Owner
Content:
Pros - The right camera for me to move from the point and shoot to DSLR.  Glass compatiblity for my move to the 5D or 1D in the next decade.  Intense macro capibilities.  Tons of accessories. Fast. Good menu layout and operation. 
Cons - expensive, heavy
I really enjoy this camera. My pictures are no longer snap-shot quality. I feel my travel, holidays and family pictures are richer. Occasionally I use the camera to capture images for work and my boss has commented on the high quality of the images.

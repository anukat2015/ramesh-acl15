Title: Something different
Content:
My wife wasn't thrilled about the weight of this product, which really was surprising (I told her she ought to be ashamed!) but we do agree that it's well designed and versatile and that it cleans rugs as well as any of our uprights (we have three; one for each floor) or old canisters (also three) for hard surfaces,furniture, etc. Indeed, we retired both a canister and an upright after getting this vacuum. We both felt compelled to look at the instructions before using it -- a first for both of us. The dirt cup seems a bit small, and cleaning the filter is a bit of a bother -- but it beats searching for and buying bags, especially since any bag I need frequently seems to be out of stock at one or more stores. The hose is a lot stiffer than a standard, non-power-brush canister (it's more like a shop vac hose). My biggest complaint: the power brush does not have a reliable, secure lock up position like a good upright and that poses problems when cleaning rugs with fringed edges (that up position is needed on the back stroke to avoid damaging the fringe) and when carrying it (the power head always flops down when it's lifted, and that's really annoying). The controls are all on the handle and easy to use, and that means you can turn the brush off and on to ameliorate that "fringe problem" ... but the no-lock-up remains a drawback for us.

Title: Satisfied, but not over the moon
Content:
I had an old stand up vacuum that seemed as if more dust came out than went in, so anything would be an upgrade. However, I hoped for a little more. It does seem to do a good job sucking up the dust, but there are little annoyances. For instance, when you want to stop the vacuum doesn't 'click' into place so it will rest in the standing up position (as demonstrated in the pictures). You need to prop it up against something and if you need to pick it up to go from hard wood to an oriental the head of the vacuum just flops down, again I wish it would lock into place so I could simply tip it upward onto the carpet, instead I have to pick up the whole floppy thing. Or - maybe I haven't mastered the 'clicks' and 'locks'.... The positive aspects are the buttons on the handle and the accessories that come with it.

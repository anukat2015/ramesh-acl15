Title: The accelerometer sucks
Content:
All the people that have mentioned that the accelerometer sucks, are right. I was at the airport yesterday, wow, my first real day with this cute little thing, I knew something was annoying the heck out of me. You know having to pull the Ipod out to everytime to fix the volume is really annoying. I meant anytime it's tilt, there it goes, you have to hold it in front of you, make sure its straight and volumize it!    thank God it was a gift, I would have return it alreaddy.

Title: Love it
Content:
I had high hopes for this product and it has delivered.  This is my first SLR, and I am no expert.  That being said, this camera is light years ahead of my Canon point and shoot cameras.  The pictures are fabulous, both crisp and colorful.  The construction seems solid; more so than I was anticipating after reading several reviews.  Furthermore, my wife has a medical condition called benign essential tremor (ETS) which makes her hands shake which has compromised her ability to use other cameras.  Between the cameras weight and the lens' ability to compensate, she takes perfect pictures with this camera. 
The battery life is also a positive.  I love the LED screen, which give me the information I need (battery life, nubmer of pics, etc.) without having to used the LCD. The camera DOES NOT come with a CF Card.  I think that this would have been included, but it is not.  
Overall, I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone.

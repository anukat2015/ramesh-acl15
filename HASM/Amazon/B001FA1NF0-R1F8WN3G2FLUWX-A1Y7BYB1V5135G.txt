Title: ipod nano 4th generation
Content:
I like the older Ipod.  This Ipod skips, and will not play songs aphabetically it skips songs and doesn't play when I want a certain song or want to play the songs aphabetically.  Very sensitive and if the car hits a bump it changes the songs. I would not purchase this again.  I would of rather purchase the older nano

Title: Best Amateur DSLR Ever!
Content:
I kept telling myself, "I'm a Canon person, I'm a Canon person."  The Eye-Fi crew kept trying to turn me into a Mac person, now they were trying to turn me into a Nikon person?  I didn't think this was possible.  They had a D40 shipped out to us for testing and I was quite a bit more surprised at how excellent this camera was.  After using a Nikon L11 Point N Shoot, I didn't think that the D40 would tickle my fancy.  In fact, I expected to be disappointed.
It seemed like no matter what mode I put it in, I just could not get a bad picture to come out of this camera.  Even when I mistakenly left it on manual focus and took way too many pictures that were out of focus they still seemed good!  The ISO settings were amazing, as well.  I put it all the way up to ISO 800 and still failed to get any real noticeable noise in the pictures (unless you looked at 150% or so).  ISO 100 was absolutely fabulous, no noise whatsoever.  I took a ton of night shots with this camera, never disappointed.
The Nikon DSLR really changed my opinions on Nikons.  I will still never use another Nikon PnS again anytime in the future, but I am now a Nikon DSLR fan!

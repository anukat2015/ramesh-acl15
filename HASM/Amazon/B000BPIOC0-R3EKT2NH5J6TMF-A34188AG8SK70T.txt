Title: Didn't last a season
Content:
I bought this last year at Easter so my wife could stay warm during the snowstorm. I used it the rest of the spring, then this fall I stuck it in the bathroom so I could stay warm without turning up the furnace.
At first, it would run if I left it in the high, or low setting, but no temperature range. Now, it won't even turn on. I bought it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, so I paid more than Amazon's price, but I wouldn't buy this model again.

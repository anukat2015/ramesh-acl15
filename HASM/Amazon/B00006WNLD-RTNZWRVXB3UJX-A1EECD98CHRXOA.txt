Title: Black & Decker one cup coffee maker
Content:
The Black & Decker Cup-At-A-Time makes one small cup of coffee at a time.
When new it does have a plastic taste.  I hope this will go away over time.  You can wash the brew basket in the dish washer but not the main unit.  No cup is furnished so you need to furnish your own.  Forget a tall cup, it will only handle a small one.
Make sure you put a cup under the nozzle before you turn it on.  As soon as you turn it on coffee comes out immediately.  I do not plan to use the furnished wire basket.  Instead I found that a regular 8-12 cup paper filter will fit.  One tablespoon of ground coffee seems to yield a good taste.
There is no warming unit and the brewer shuts it's self off after making the coffee.
Ideal for that one cup of joe.

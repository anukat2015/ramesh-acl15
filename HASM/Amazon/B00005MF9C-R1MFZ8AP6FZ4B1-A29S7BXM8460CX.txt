Title: What a mess!
Content:
I was so excited about this product, especially since it received so many positive reviews. The first problem is, it takes way too long. After the initiail brewing, it continues to drip for several minutes, so your coffee will start to cool off before the mug is ready to be pulled away. Second, the coffee grounds get all over the place. Today, I even put in less grounds to see what happened, and it is still all over the inside of the machine, even where the water goes, making for a tedious cleaning process each time. And yes, there are grounds in my cup of coffee. This was a complete waste of money.

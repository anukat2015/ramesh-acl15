Title: Impressed so far
Content:
Bought the 80G to replace the old trusty 30G I've had for years. Alas the trusty 30G didn't fare so well after dropping in on my concrete driveway. So far (two days) the 80G has worked like a charm. I am most impressed with how easy it was to load with all my tunes (~3,500) and pics (~900).  I simply hooked it up and walked away for an hour.  Thinner, lighter, and larger screen than the 30G.  This is a nice product and I find most of the complaints (e.g., split cover screen and its speed) to be trivial.

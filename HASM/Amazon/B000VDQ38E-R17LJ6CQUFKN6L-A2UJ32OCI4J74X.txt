Title: Waste of money
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner because it had a picture of my dog breed on the box.  I thought this cleaner could handle dog fur.  Nope. I've had it less than 6 months and it's going to the dump because the motor is shot, I've had to replace the belt 3 times... it just doesn't work.

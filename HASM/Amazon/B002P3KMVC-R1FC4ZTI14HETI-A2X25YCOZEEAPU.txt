Title: Good laptop, not great
Content:
I have been using this laptop for a couple of months now and am mostly happy with it.  
The bad:
-Comes with a smaller capacity battery compared to the UL80 series.  Does not last 11hrs, even on the power save mode.
-Touchpad is very sensitive and interferes with your typing if you accidentally touch it.
-Built quality is suspect.  The edge of the case creeks when you grab on to it.  Battery is not secured in the back very well, I brought my daughter a EeePC and I thought the built quality of the EeePC was better.  It was more solid and has a better feeling keyboard.
-I do miss the optical drive.
The good:
-Light weight, good size, fits in a suitcase easily.  
-Great for traveling. Hard to beat price with comparable specifications, even after a couple of months.
-Even with less then the advertised 11hrs of operations, the run time is still outstanding.
-Runs all your basic office programs fine and has a good internet signal compared to other computers I've tried.
-I am not sure if it is the laptop or Windows 7, but the quick startup is a big plus compared to my old xp machine.

Title: Great Vacuum for MOST families
Content:
This is a great vacuum for the money.  I would highly recommend it. 
If you have a golden retriever dog  - then just know this in advance.......  It's not meant for dogs with a lot of hair.  It just means you have to clean the masses of hair which wraps itself around the filter after each room you vaccum.  Anyone with a Golden knows how much hair they spread.  It can get frustrating.  Of course, her hair used to fill up my expensive Electrolux bags really quickly too which cost money.
The worst thing, however, is carpet cleaner.  You know that sprinkly, smelly stuff you shake onto carpets to get them to smell nice or clean them.  Well, those fine particles get into the filter and you have to spend quite a bit of time using a little brush to get them out of your filter.  I would not recommend using this vacuum with those types of carpet cleaners.  Their instruction book also cautions on this.
Otherwise, this vacuum is wonderful for the money.  It doesn't glide over carpets like an electrolux because of the suction but it works great.

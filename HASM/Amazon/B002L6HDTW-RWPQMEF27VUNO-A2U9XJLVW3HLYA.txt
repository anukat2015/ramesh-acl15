Title: The radio does work with other headphones
Content:
I received this ipod as a Christmas surprise. I also own an old Ipod Mini and have used ITunes for years to organize my music files so I was already a little familiar with the Ipod interface. This is my first nano so I can't comment on how it compares with other nanos. 
Other reviews repeatedly state that the built in radio only works with the ipod headphones. I find this confusing, because I tried it with other headphones and it works just fine! I used a pair of "J-Bud"s and the reception was exactly the same as with the ipod headphones. 
The features I like:
*The built in video camera is fun, but like others state it is not the best video camera. 
*The radio (as noted earlier)
*I am enjoying the built in pedometer
*I found it easy to use
*It is very small and attractive
*There is a stop watch and voice memo features
*I actually enjoy the games--they are nice or killing a few minutes
*Of course, my favorite feature it the MP3 player--I have 948 songs loaded on my Ipod and it is not full!
A couple minor gripes:
*I wish you could upload the video files into i-tunes. It is easy to upload the videos you take, but integrating it into i-tunes would be more elegant.
*I wish the camera took still photos.
*I don't see the appeal of the "shake" feature, but it is easy enough to turn off in the settings.

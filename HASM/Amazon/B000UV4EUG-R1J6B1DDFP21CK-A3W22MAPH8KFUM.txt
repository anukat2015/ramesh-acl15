Title: Creative Zen's die after 1 year
Content:
I have purchased two zens in the last year one 4gb and one 8gb.  Both were well taken care of.  One completely died after less than a year, the other got the white screen of death (no display at all) soon after a year.  Unfortunately the company only offers a 1 year warranty, so after 1 year your player dies and you are S.O.L.   
I would suggest to anyone buying an mp3 player to spend a little more and get a reputable product like the ipod.

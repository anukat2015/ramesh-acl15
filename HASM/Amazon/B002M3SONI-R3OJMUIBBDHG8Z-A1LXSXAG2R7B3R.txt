Title: Unusable
Content:
The only way to control this mp3 player is through controls on the headphones.  I like to use my own headphones, so this unit is basically unusable.  
Even with the Apple headphones, the controls don't work very well.  Do yourself a favor, and get a different product.  I don't know what Apple was thinking.

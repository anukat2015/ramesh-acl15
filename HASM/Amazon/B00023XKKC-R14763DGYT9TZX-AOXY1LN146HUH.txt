Title: perhaps a lemon?
Content:
The unit I received has a few problems:
1) It is quite loud. (We have another of the same unit in this building, and it is not nearly as loud.)
2) The first weekend I left it turned on, it flooded my office. It has a resevoir to catch the collected humidity, but almost all of it is supposed to be exhausted through the exhaust hose. Our other unit collects perhaps a cup of water per week in the resevoir. This one dumped perhaps four gallons of water onto my desk and onto the floor.
3) I'm having a very difficult time with Soleus getting this problem taken care of. They do not return calls; they promise to do things; but nothing has happened yet. It's been a few weeks.
I'm not happy.

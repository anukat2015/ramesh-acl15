Title: Old Skool Pentaxian making the jump
Content:
Very cool camera. 
I've shot with a 35mm pentax SuperME since 1988.  Then in 2006 made the leap to digital SLR with a Canon Rebel XT (350d).  I had  great fun with the XT, and still use it as my backup camera.
I've got more serious with my photography and decided to purchase the K20D from a Nikon guy that won it in a photo contest and had no use for it.
WOW- this camera is light years ahead of  the 350D!  Only thing I am working hard to  get around is that I miss canon's warmer colors.  The XT takes pictures that are a lot warmer.. and that suits my style very well.
I could of course use Photosho/Lightroom to add some warmth.. but that is besides the point.
I'm very happy with the low light performance, and the 14.6 MP effective range... good stuff!

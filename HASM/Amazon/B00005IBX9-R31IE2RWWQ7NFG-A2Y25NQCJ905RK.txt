Title: Good Looking, Strong, and the perfect size
Content:
I just remodeled my kitchen and for the first time I am buying appliances to match the decor. The large appliances are black and go well with the warm red wood of the cabinets. I really baulked at the idea of stainless steel in the kitchen. It's my Kitchen not a medical lab. This black chrome caught my eye. I didn't want shiny chrome in the mix but small black appliances? I dunno... This black chrome was the perfect solution and Cuisinart black chrome soon entered my Christmas List.  This coffee maker was the first thing out the Box (Thanks Lee!) I have always owned cheap coffee makers and this new Cuisinart brew central has propelled me into the new century! Home made coffee has never tasted so good. I use to go to Dunkin doughnut's every day before work.  This coffee maker is so good I went out and bought a thermos! So many features, A special setting for small amounts of coffee(4 cups). Filtered water! Yes you can taste the difference. Different Hot plate settings. Self cleaning!  Stop and pour! 
A beep to let you know when your coffee is ready. The timer!  The gold filter, although I continue to use paper filters! Nice to know that in a pinch I really don't need them. This baby is tall dark and handsome so be sure to measure to make sure he fits under the cabinets nicely. Good looking and makes a strong presence on the counter. I am a shortie and have had no problems filling the reservoir. I look forward to my warm cup of Joe now. OH yeah easy clean up too.Cuisinart 2 Pack Water Filters DCC RWF Your gonna need these. Stock up!

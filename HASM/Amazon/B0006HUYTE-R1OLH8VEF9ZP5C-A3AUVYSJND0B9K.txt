Title: For hard surfaces- not carpets
Content:
I spent more time reading the reviews of this vacuum than the product description- mea culpa! I bought it as a gift for my daughter and only found out afterward that it is not meant for carpets. I am to blame for this, but I want others to avoid my mistake and not buy this if what they want is a vacuum for home carpets. It does have powerful suction but it only does a poor job on her carpets.

This camera is just plain awesome. Unless you use a camera all day, every day and need the extra toughness that a metal body might give you, this thing will probably handle any possible photographic situation you would encounter. It has adjustments for just about everything, yet takes a real fine shot by just setting it to AUTO right out of the box. Read the review by KenRockwell.com on the D90 (Google will find it for you) before you plunk down twice as much money for a D300. See some sample shots at the following link:

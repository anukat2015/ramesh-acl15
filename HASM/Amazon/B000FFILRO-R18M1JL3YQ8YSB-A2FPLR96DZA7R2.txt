Title: My Last Coffee Maker
Content:
Finally!!! A coffee maker that gives you a HOT cup of coffee and it's in 3 minutes flat! I was really surprised! I read alot of reviews for this Bunn and decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. I also noticed that the coffee tasted better, not bitter!! Just make sure you buy the coffee filters made for Bunn (the others are too short). The filters are not at all expensive, I got them on Amazon also.Take a chance too and you won't be sorry!

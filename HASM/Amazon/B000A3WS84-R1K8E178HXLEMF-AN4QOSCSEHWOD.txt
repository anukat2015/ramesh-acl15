Title: Perfect yet not so perfect...
Content:
Well like most people have been raving about, the iPod Video is the newest and best iPod yet. Yes, the battery life is greatly increased by 5 hours +/-, but thats playing music normally. 
Most people have been exaggerating on the fact that the iPod video will only get two hours of video playback? Well remember. It's not like it's desgiend specially to play full length movies. If you do wanna watch a full length movie, just get a portable dvd player. I mean you've all got to say the iPod Video is currently the only mp3 player that can play videos. At least give Apple some credit. A while back they introduce the Nano which revolutionized small mp3 players, but now introducing the Video, Apple has surely gained the lead.
The ipod video has very good graphics, nobody can say it doesn't. It truely does. 
4/5 because the graphics are awesome, it has completly changed mp3 players to mp3 players/movie players which is awesome. It is perfect in nearly every aspect. Aside from the fact it doesn't come with a dock and the battery life is WAY SHORT when watching video, it's not bad.
4/5, very good. I suggest buying it if you're not afraid of a little weak battery life during video playback.
Enjoy!

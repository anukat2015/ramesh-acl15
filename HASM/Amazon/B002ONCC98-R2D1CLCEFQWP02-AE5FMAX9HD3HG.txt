Title: HP g71 340 US
Content:
Very lightweight for such a large screen, lighter than the `15-inch Gateway it is replacing.   Very fast, good screen.   Haven't tested full extent of battery life but its definitely more than 3 hours.  Only two things I don't like.  The keyboard is full size, with numbers on right, which means its a little off center.  The raised ridges on the "F" and "J" key are very slight, barely noticeable, so it is hard to find them without looking.  Not sure why HP made them so small on this model, because I looked at other HP laptops and th4ey were much easier to feel.  Its a problem now but I assume I will get used to it over time.  However, I definitely like having the number pad on the right side.  The only real negative is the volume on the internal speakers.   They are VERY low (I've seen similar complaints in other reviews, so I am confident it is not just my machine).  I haven't tried headphones.  Otherwise, it is a great laptop.

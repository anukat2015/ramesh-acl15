Title: Pricey, but love it so far!

Recent PC user yada yada yada.
13 Inch Aluminum Macbook 2ghz - from a pure price to spec standpoint these things are about 2x as expensive as a comparable windows PC, but you also get more than just a laptop as well. What you are paying for is the packaging and design beyond the hardware; which is actually worth quite a lot.
What I love. Aluminum design, trackpad, screen (yes I actually like the glossy screen and better than the white macbook), battery life, speed, bootcamp, easy upgrade-ability and just overall "work of art" styling Apple produces.
What I don't like. Price, only 2 USB ports, only 2gb of memory (doesn't affect speed, but should be 4gb just be competitive at this price range) and hard drive size.
What I experienced. New user to Macs and OSX so the keyboard takes some getting use to, shortcuts are confusing, dock is confusing, bootup is really fast, battery takes long time to charge but lasts a long time, and wireless is fast.
Final. I really like this and don't regret spending the money. If you are looking for something different than a windows machine and a very well designed laptop, you will like this macbook. I look forward to learning more about this OS and hardware.

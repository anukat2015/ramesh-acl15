Hubby and I live in a 1200 square foot apartment which has a central gas heating system. I bought three of these heaters because of the high cost of heating but mostly, the noise of the central heat becomes very irritating after several months. It's so noisy that when we watch tv in the evening, we have to turn it up and down when the heater goes on and off.  
I love this heater. I turned it for the first time this evening...warmth and quiet...perrrrrrrrrfect! It's light weight with handles so it can be moved effortlessly if desired.

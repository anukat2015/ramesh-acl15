Title: Finally, no spills!
Content:
You really don't know how wonderful this coffee maker is until you have gone through several others.  The carafe pours flawlessly.  We use a gold-tone filter which gives good flow.  The alarm is loud enough to hear in the other room to notify you when it's done brewing and later when it's powering off.  When you use the proper amount of coffee, or even a little more, no overflows.  You can pour a cup while brewing and not overflow.  Granted, user error can make any feature fail, but this is the best home-use coffee maker we've used out of 4 others.

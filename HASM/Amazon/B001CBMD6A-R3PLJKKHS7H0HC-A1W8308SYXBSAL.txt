Title: Bought for the speed
Content:
Those of you upgrading from a Point and Shoot camera can relate to the lag time between photos. We got so tired of waiting for our PNS to spool up to take another photo we finally upgraded to this DSLR. Wish I had done it 3 years ago. This Rebel is so easy to use and the pictures are great and best of all it is super fast. I am a total Neophyte when it comes to cameras; I just want a good picture. This product delivers and I think the cost is spot on.

Updated review (Feb 5):
I deleted my original review (below) so that I could post an update and kick my rating up to 5 stars.
After one month of heavy use this machine is nothing short of remarkable.  The ability to serve everyone exactly what they want whether it is bold, mild, decaf, flavored or tea is well worth the price alone.  I am also happy to report that I have not experienced any more "clogs" as mentioned below.  My wife loves the brewer especially since I dropped by the local Sam's and picked up a pack of 20oz insulated cups w/ lids.  No more stopping by the coffee shop before the long drives, trips to the store or the kids' games.  Not sure if this is a good or bad thing but I find myself drinking much more coffee than I did before due to the convenience.
The ability to control your brew size has really been a welcome feature.  The 20oz cups perfectly hold 2 "travel mug" cycles.  Most mugs work well with one "travel mug" cycle but we do have some that will hold 2 "mug" cycles or 1 "mug" plus 1 "cup".  Of course, the brew size and type of coffee will determine its strength and you might prefer different sizes.  This works particularly well with tea bags if you just want to fill the cup and steep to your desired strength. 
Based on my experience I really wouldn't recommend the K-cups for brewing tea.  Many of the teas available in K-cups are also available at your local store in bags for much less and it is much easier to control the strength with tea bags depending on how long you let it steep.  I also noticed that the Keurig formulated hot chocolate is now available.  Again, you are probably better off with a bulk mix so you can better adjust the quantity instead of pre-measured packets that are priced at a significant premium.  I'll admit I haven't tried it and maybe the "Premium Double Chocolate" is worth the price -- but not for me.
Lastly, the reusable K-cup is now available as an accessory.  I ordered one along with the additional filters but have not had a chance to try it out.
***********************************************
I bought my wife the "Special Edition" Keurig for Xmas after reading many favorable reviews (OK, I wanted it too).  We just finished putting it through its initial paces and wanted to comment on a few issues.
After unpacking the brewing system ordered from Amazon, I was surprised to find no reusable K-cup.  Other reviewers gave the impression that it wasn't just the WS "exclusive" brewers that included the K-cup.  This is a huge disappointment as the reusable K-cup was the deciding factor in purchasing the B60.  Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long for it to be offered as a separate accessory.
So far we have brewed three cups -- tea, flavored coffee and regular coffee.  The first two worked very well.  On the third K-cup I hit the brew button and a little water dripped into my mug then it stopped.  I opened and closed the lid and hit the brew button a second time.  Again, very little water went into the cup and I could hear water being drained back into the reservoir.  After a little troubleshooting I decided I had a clogged exit needle.  When I found the section in the user guide dealing with cleaning the exit needle (the troubleshooting chart referred to the wrong page) I was amazed.  It instructs you to stick a paper clip or "other similar tool" into the exit needle to clear the clog.  Come on, I just spent $200 on a brewer and you're telling me I need to find a paper clip to ram in the brewer instead of providing a cleaning tool.  Since I didn't have a paper clip I used a sewing needle.
Well, once the clog was cleared I continued to brew the third cup (which happened to be mine).  Coffee wasn't bad however, when I got to the last swig I really wasn't paying attention and ended up with a mouth full of coffee grounds.  I hope this was due to the clog and not a regular occurrence.
I'll add to the review later as it gets more use.  I just wanted people to be aware that not all "Special Editions" come with the reusable K-cup.

Title: Apple iPod Shuffle- Pros and Cons
Content:
Pros:
-Inexpensive iPod
-Can store up to 480 minutes of music (960 minutes for the 1GB iPod Shuffle)
-Good battery life (about 12 hours)
-Small design
-Compatable with I-Tunes
-"Shuffle" feature
-ability to play your songs in the order you desire (but that takes away the concept of the iPod SHUFFLE ;D ).
Cons: 
-No Screen (If it did have a screen, though, that would take away the concept of the iPod SHUFFLE. Also it would cost more.)
-Buttons may be a little too small (At least they function, and that's what matters.)
-If you have a big music collection, this iPod is not for you
(If you have a big music collection, I recommend an iPod Mini or a regular iPod, or, if you have about 960 minutes worth of music, upgrade to an iPod Shuffle 1GB.)
Overall: I'm giving the iPod Shuffle a 4 out of 5. If you're looking for a good quality MP3 player or are new to the music world, this is it. However this may be a disapointment for those with a big music collection.

Title: First step into 'high-end' cameras
Content:
I bought this camera my tool for learning about digital photography.  It has been very easy to use and a great learning tool.  As with any camera, the lens makes a big difference in the photographs you take.  The lens this comes with is okay for a generic starter, but you will quickly want to invest in a more high-end one based upon the type of photography you want to do.  It is compatiable with the older Canon lenses, so that has been a plus.

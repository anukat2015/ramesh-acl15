Title: Little workhorse coffeemaker
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker 2 years ago for my office, and it's still going strong. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and reliable. It makes coffee hot (unlike some that make it just warm), and has room enough in the basket to make it good and strong (I usually use 2.5T coffee per mug but could double that). I'm drinking a mug of fresh coffee from it right now. Even the mug is good, as I've had too many travel mugs that didn't seal properly at the lid and would end up dribbling down my chin, but this one is nice and snug and stays put. No muss, no fuss.
The reasons I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 are that 1) if you fill the mug all the way to the top to fill the water basin, you will have spillage (leave about 1/2" space from top and you're fine), and 2) if your mug isn't positioned properly, you may find yourself brewing onto your counter or desk as there's no brew-pause or other switch to indicate to the coffeemaker that the mug isn't positioned right.

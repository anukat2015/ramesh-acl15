Title: Just what I wanted; no leaks
Content:
I needed to replace my old coffee maker, mostly because
it had a tendency to leak all over the counter.  I had
some worry about this coffee maker, since there were some
reviews that complained that it would leak.  But there
were many more reviews that said it didn't.
Fortunately, I took a chance and ordered this, and found
that at least in my experience, it has never once leaked,
after owning it for many months.

Title: World's Greatest Coffeemaker
Content:
This coffeemaker is awesome. I have tried four others in the past but never a Cuisinart and this one is by far the best one ever.  I read all the reviews before purchasing it. They were right it deserves 5 stars. It doesn't leak when you pour it like others can. The last coffeemaker I had could of gave free facials so much steam came out the top while brewing. The 3 warming plate settings are great. I keep it on high when there is a full pot and medium when there is less coffee so it is drinkable right away. I put very cold creamer in my coffee and the high warmer plate setting keeps me from reheating my coffee after putting in the creamer. Yea! Its a keeper and has the best warranty which I don't think I'll need.

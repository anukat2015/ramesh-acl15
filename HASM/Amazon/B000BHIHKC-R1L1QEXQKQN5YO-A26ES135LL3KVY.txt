Title: Nothing Fancy but a Decent Cup of Coffee
Content:
If you think you are going to get a dynamic cup of coffee or a coffeehouse quality latte, you will be disappointed. You will get a good cup of coffee in a short time. I do think it is better than drip. The better quality pods produce a better quality cup of coffee. In my area, I can only purchase the Folgers, Maxwell House., and Senseo brands. I have purchased premium pods on-line but they cost more than I am willing to pay for a cup of coffee at home. The Folgers makes a better cup. The Senseo seems weak to me.  I have not tried the Maxwell House. 
	The two lattes I've tried, Senseo and Folgers, are disgusting.
	This design is a lot better than the original HCC100 that only lasted six months before self-destructing. I would have avoided Home Café altogether because of that short lifespan, but it is one of the few models that allows me to brew more than a nine ounce cup.
	The cleaning button does not make a lot of sense. Why not just push the nine-ounce button and not put in a pod? 
	I have not noticed any plastic taste and the temperature is neither scalding nor tepid.
	It is quick and easy to use, even when you are half-asleep.

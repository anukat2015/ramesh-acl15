Title: I'm amazed that anyone would call this camera an entry level SLR
Content:
Yes...professional level SLR's have specific criteria to adhere to, but none of the criteria has to do with image quality...Image quality from the XSI is second to none, even the outrageously priced full sensor Canon's and others...Scan the internet and you will find plenty to back this up...Many pros are changing over to the XSI because of handling ease and comparable image quality...Then why would anyone pay thousands more for other cameras...Beats me, unless many think that having a heavy, more expensive camera with more dials and controls makes it a pro camera...I am a pro-photographer and I can tell you first hand that the only aspect of photography that counts when making a living is image quality...but, don't ask the other pros...they may still contend that the XSI is still entry level...and that my friends IS..."BULL."

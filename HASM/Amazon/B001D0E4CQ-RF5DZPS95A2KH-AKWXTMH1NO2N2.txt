Title: Good product, frustrating, lousy support
Content:
I like the video quality and the large hard drive.  I have 4,707 songs on it, some music videos, a TV show,a movie, many pictures... and I still have 200 Gb left... 
But be forewarned-- to really make it work you'll have to shell out additional bucks for plug-ins...  and it still can't play many video formats...  This aspect is really confusing...  It would be nice to have a list of the supported formats WITH the specs for that format...  but I haven't found it...  
And the support is... shall I say it... even worse than the support on most products...  For 2 nights... I left a message... they were supposed to call back and never did...  on the third night I finally got through... but ended up finding the solution myself...  
So enjoy... but be prepared to be frustrated, too.

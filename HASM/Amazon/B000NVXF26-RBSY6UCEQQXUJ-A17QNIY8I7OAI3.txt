Title: Amazon...A+  Olympus...A+++
Content:
Another perfect transaction with Amazon!  They even credited my account when the price dropped $11 a week after I ordered the camera.  As far as the camera goes...nothing but WOW!  I am new to the DSLR world, but am quickly learning how much more capability is available at my finger tips with this camera.  I spent an average amount of time researching DSLRs before buying this one.  At first, I was going with the Canon Digital Rebel XTI without question.  Then I started looking at the Nikons and finally got to the Olympus.  As far as picture quality and standard features go, all three brands were comparable, it's not until you get to the details of what each can provide/offer where the differences start showing up.  The factors that won me over were the image stabilization, LCD Live-vew capture preview, and the camera/lens kit quality/value.   I was impressed with the reviews for the quality of the kit lens' vs the other competitors.  Now after shooting a few hundred photos and playing with different settings, this camera can deliver great shots that I could never get before.  With some adjustments, I took some very good low light stills of Christmas lights/scenes.  I can't wait to use this camera on my upcoming trip to Yosemite.  Overall, this is an outstanding camera and an excellent kit value.

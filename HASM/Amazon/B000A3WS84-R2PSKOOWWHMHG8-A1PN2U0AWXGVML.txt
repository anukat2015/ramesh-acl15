Title: Excellent except for battery life from video
Content:
Let me say this is my fourth ipod. Got my first one about 2 1/2 years ago with the 3rd generation. I. got it replaced after about 2 years as the battery died quickly. They replaced it with a 30 gig photo ipod. Then when the BLACK nano came out, I just had to get it! Love it except everything scratches it, including cotton pants! Thats the only downside to the nano. Then yesterday at the San Francisco Apple store around noon the new IPOD with video came out and I snatched it. Its the white 30 gig (thats all that was availible). The thing is spectacular and the picture quality is awesome. The plastic front looks like its made of the same material as the nano so I'm being extra cautious and actually put a screen protector over it that was made for my Compac Ipac. It works great. YOU just have to cut it to fit over most of the ipod and the scroll wheel still works great with the plastic over it. 
The bad news is the battery only lasted 1 hour 45 minutes as I just tested it with a full battery. Barely enough for a movie but the ipod is mostly used for music. I can use my PSP for movies. 
You have to buy the plug in adaptor as this model along with the nano does not come with one but thats understandable as the units are fairly reasonably priced compared to other MP3 players and the first ipod was only 5 gigs, this is really a deal.
My nano is black and the screen protectors works great for that one too. Apple's computers aren't the best but I think their mp3 players are!

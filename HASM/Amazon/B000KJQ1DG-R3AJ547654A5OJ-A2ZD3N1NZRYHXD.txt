Title: Nikon D40
Content:
This camera was purchased after alot of research and it deserves all the praise given it by professional reviewers. Access to the menus is quick and its use is almost intuitive. The quality of the images is splendid, even at high ISO's. The lack of depth-of-field preview has not presented any inconvenience, although I used the feature on my Nikon N 80. The editing features "in camera" are helpful. It is also very rugged. While travelling on a bus tour, the camera rolled out of my lap and bounced onto the floor of the bus and continued to roll for several feet without any apparent damage.I would recommend a slightly longer zoom lens.

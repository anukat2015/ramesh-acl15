Title: I love my BUNN!
Content:
I wasn't thrilled about plunking down $150 for a coffee pot, especially after reading the reviews about how they leak.  I guess I was one of the lucky ones or BUNN has fixed their leaking problem.  My coffee pot works perfectly.  This is the best coffee pot I've ever owned.  I have coffee on all day long and I was getting tired of throwing out old coffee.  With this pot, the coffee stays hot all day without that burnt taste.  I'll probably save money in the long run since I'm not throwing coffee out.  I am very fussy about my coffee and as soon as it is the least bit old, i won't drink it. Ever since my first Bunn, I have not used any other coffee pot.  I can't even drink coffee that comes from another pot.  I don't know why it makes such good coffee, but it's just awesome, not to mention that by the time I get my cup and put the cream in, the coffee is done.  Bottom line:  This coffee pot makes the best coffee, it makes it FAST, and it stays hot all day.  I just had to write this review because I am thrilled with my coffee pot.

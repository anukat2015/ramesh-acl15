Title: Good but not Great
Content:
Has all the functionality of a good coffee maker as stated in many of the reviews. However the main points that leave it lacking are the screw in top  for the carafe which is difficult to remove and painful to use. Must be careful when pouring coffee because hot liquid will come out the spout of the carafe and also the top.  I wanted a thermal carafe to avoid burnt coffee, however the top does not seal the coffee in the carafe, it has a separate cover which to place over the top cover to reduce temperature loss. This is a poor design in my opinion. Overall, I think for the money it is a pretty good coffee maker. It is very good at what it does and the coffee will be perfect every time.

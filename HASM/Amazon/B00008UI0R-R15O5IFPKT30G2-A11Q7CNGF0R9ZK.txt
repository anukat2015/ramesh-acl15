Title: Great suction, but faulty workmanship
Content:
I am amazed at how much dirt, pet hair, and dust that this machine picks up!  I definitely feel like my house is much cleaner after I use it.  My only two complaints (you decide whether they are big or small) would be that the machine is a bit bulky and difficult to maneuver, and the carpet setting (where the roller brush spins) works only periodically.  It is covered under warrenty, I just have to pack it up and take it down to the local authorized repair shop.  Because only one of my nine rooms has carpet, I haven't done it yet. Overall, it is a great vaccuum.

Title: Another great Canon product!
Content:
I held on to my Canon film SLR as long as I could while the digital camera era passed me by, but the cost for the Rebel XTi became reasonable enough for me to splurge into digital without sacrificing my existing Canon EOS lenses. The only existing Canon equipment I swapped was my Speedlight 420EZ which wasn't compatible with EOS digital for a 430EX. I have used Canon products for over 20 years. Canon Rules!

Title: 3G Nano is very light
Content:
This 3rd generation was a huge improvement in weight over my older photo iPod. But the light weight could also sometimes be a little frustrating. If I had it sitting on my desk at work and quickly turned around, I'd pull it off my desk and it would bounce to the ground.  My older iPod brick would offer resistance and I'd stop before it would go flying. 
I'm not crazy about the cover flow option, as the art work is often wrong of missing. Volume isn't as consistent as it was on my older unit. It's either low, or really, really loud.  I've tried a number of settings to adjust this, and it never seems to get any better.

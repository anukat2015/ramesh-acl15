Title: Mercedes of Cannister Vacs
Content:
My friend bought this vacuum last year, and when he told me what he paid for it I scoffed!  I couldn't imagine spending this kind of money for a vacuum, and I muddled around with my cheap lightweight bagless upright with the expensive paper filters that constantly clogged with dust and needed frequent cleaning or replacement.
Well, I sprung for this Miele Antares, and love it!  Who thought I could get excited by a vacuum?  This machine is compact, stylish, easy to maneuver around the apartment, and does a great job with fantastic suction.  One very nice feature is that each time you buy a new box of (5) bags, it comes with the two replacement filters that this vacuum requires. I used to have to pay $15.00 for a replacement filter on my cheap vacuum ... now that pays for 5 bags and the filter!
The unit *feels* quality, sturdily constructed, quiet, and picks up nicely. The reviews on this make it sound like the turbo brush is extra, but it's not -- it's included with the Antares.  The Antares comes with 3 attachments (crevice, upholstery, and brush) as well as two heads (parquet /bare floor, and turbo brush that uses the machine's suction to spin the brush).  it also comes with two bags (one bag and all filters are pre-installed, which is a nice touch) and the bags are pretty ingenious... when you remove them, the bag opening is automatically covered to prevent dirt/dust from escaping.
I could go on and on, but I encourage you to just pick one up.  Sometimes you really do get what you pay for!

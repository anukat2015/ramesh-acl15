Title: 100% Satisfied
Content:
I was in dire need of a powerful vacuum that was good for both carpet and tile/wood floors.  I also needed something light weight and was able to get into small tight places as I have a lot of furniture.  This vacuum fits all my needs and does a fantastic job.  The small canister easily moves around the room and takes corners with a breeze.  I was shocked the first time I vacuumed the carpet in my living room and discovered all the sand that was hidden deep in the carpet that my last vacuum left behind.
I love the ease of emptying the vacuum without a mess or my hands getting dirty. I would say I am 100% satisfied with this vacuum and would highly recommend it to anyone.

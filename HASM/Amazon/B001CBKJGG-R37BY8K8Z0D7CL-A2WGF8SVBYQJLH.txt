Title: I LOVE THIS CAMERA
Content:
I was going back and forth whether to purchase a DSLR camera that is more than a point n shoot as a non professional and I absolutely love this camera. I wanted a camera that I can take pictures of my baby and not miss that smile. The point n shoots are too slow and I have no pictures of her smiling- well I can not say that any longer- I am able to capture all the smiles. The camera handles wonderful and I have no complaints. I bought this camera on a special day from Amazon and was able to save more money. I would recommend this camera to anyone that wants to move away from the point n shoot and be able to capture all the important memories.

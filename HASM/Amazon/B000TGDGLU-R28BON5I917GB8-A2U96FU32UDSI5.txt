Title: Great heater
Content:
I bought the DeLonghi to heat my home office during the day and my bedroom at night.  Both are fairly small rooms (10 x 12ish), and the DeLonghi does a fantastic job, even when it's in the single digits outside.  I'm able to set my GFA central heat down to 50 and just run the DeLonghi at the 3-4 setting on low voltage all night--works great!  I don't use the ComforTemp because the temperature is way too high.  During the day, I run the heater at 6 on low voltage in my office, which is drafty and has a large window.  The heater keeps it comfortably warm.  My only real complaint is that it takes hours to heat a room up.  I usually move the heater into my bedroom at around 9 in order to go to bed at 11, and then I still blast the central heat for a bit to get the room warm enough to go to sleep; after that, the DeLonghi keeps the temperature perfect all night.
I did have trouble with the horrible outgassing smell when I first used the heater.  I followed the instructions and ran it on high for several hours, but that didn't get rid of the smell.  I ended up running it on high for several days, and even now it smells when I run it on 6 (max setting) on high voltage.  I just stick to the low and medium voltage and lower heat settings and there's no smell.

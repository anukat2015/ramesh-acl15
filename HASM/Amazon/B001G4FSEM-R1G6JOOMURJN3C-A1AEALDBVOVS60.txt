Title: Keeps on ticking
Content:
We have two older Model HC-452S units that work perfectly.  We brought these on our first snow-bird trip this winter thinking the two would be needed, not true.  Temperatures in Texas in the 20s and only used one unit to maintain any temp. desired.  Unit cycled perfectly to high speed fan and heat to no heat and slow speed fan. We don't need our on-board furnace which means more fuel for heating water and cooking. Our camper is a HILO and 20 feet long. We're heading to Florida and might not need them, but if we do!!

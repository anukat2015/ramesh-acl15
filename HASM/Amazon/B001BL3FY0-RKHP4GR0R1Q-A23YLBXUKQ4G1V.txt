Title: I LOVE this coffee brewer
Content:
I recently used one similar to this in a Wyngate Inn and loved it. This little gem is cheap, small( great for tiny kitchens) and brews one delicious cup of coffee in under 3 mins. I also just get Senseo pods from Target at $4.84 a peice for 18.
I will save so much money at Starbux now!
Best purchase I have made all year.

Title: Ipod Nano- 2G
Content:
Now if you're hauling around an old CD player with a big CD case and all your doing in scrathing the disks and losing them. Well then the Ipod Nano is for you. Its width the size of a pencil width, and it able to hold up to 500 songs, i think you just got yourself 3 CD players but in something that doesnt skip on songs if you're running, and is extremly tiny. I have 70 songs on my Ipod already. If you already have a song on a CD that you want in your ipod, just insert the CD into the computer and put in on the ipod. Theres also a music store so you can shop for songs, albums, and TV shows( if you have the ipod that plays videos) for resonable prices. So no more hauling around the bulky CD players man, just grab your ipod and go.

Title: Great as heaven!
Content:
More storage capacity, compact, elegant; it's perfect!
I bought this to replace my old Nano of 4 gigas (1st gen), and by now I'm happy with it, because it's the same, but better, with the great adition of better batteries, they really last long; not like the 1st gen nano.

Title: Bottom line, it makes fabulous coffee
Content:
So there are a few things I'm not impressed with in the few weeks since I've had my MT500Plus. First, I'm not a huge fan of the styling. For the brand and the coffee it makes, I think the maker looks a little cheap. Feels a little cheap, too, quite honestly. Kinda light, not real hefty. I also concur with other reviews about the carafe lid... yep, it pours slowly and it's sort of a pain to always be sure the lid is "just right". Being of forgetful mind, I also don't like dealing with opening and closing it all the time to keep my coffee extra warm. I think the coffee could be made just a little hotter (bear in mind, I like my coffee pretty steamy).
So why the 5 stars, you wonder? Bottom line, the coffee is fabulous. Perfectly smooth, just delicious. I'm not a coffee addict. I don't drink coffee for the caffeine fix. It's rare for me to even drink 5 cups in a whole week. But when I do drink it, I demand it taste really good. I've had to try out several makers to finally get to this one, and I can say with confidence that this maker isn't going back. All I've wanted is a great cup of coffee -- the other little quirky things don't matter to me like taste does. Crossing my fingers and knocking on wood, I think I've found the right one.

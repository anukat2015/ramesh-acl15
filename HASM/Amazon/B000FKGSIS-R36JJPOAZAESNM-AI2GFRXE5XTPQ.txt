Title: Quieter than most, but poor thermostat
Content:
I wanted a quiet heater to use in my den in the evening. I watch TV in this room and didn't want a noisy heater that competed with it, forcing me to raise and lower the volume to adjust for a noisy heater fan. This heater is the quietest fan-forced unit I've tried, and I've tried quite a few. The only heaters quieter than this one would be the micathermic or oil-filled models. The micathermic ones only heat up the area directly in front of the panel and not the whole room, and the oil filled heaters take way too long to heat up.
Now for the bad news......the digital thermostat. First off, the settings are in five degree increments, rather than one degree. If I set it for 65 the heater brings the room up to about 68 then shuts off. That's fine, but then the room will drop to 63 or 64 and the heater doesn't come back on. I'm either going to be hot or cold. If I set the unit to 70, after reaching 75 degrees it still runs----totally unacceptable. If Holmes improves the thermostat they would have a decent little heater here. Oh, one other thing. There are two output settings, low and high. They only control fan speed. The heater uses 1500 watts at both settings, unlike most other models.

Title: CD PLAYERS NO NEED TO EXISTS
Content:
I've recently purchased my 2GB iPod Nano yesterday and I'm loving it. It's so small. The picture magnifies it to appear larger than what it is. Very light weight, easy to handle. It even has games on it (which the reviews doesn't state). Great. Great. Great. Tired of carrying around a cd player and a case of 13+ disc. Tired of purchasing batteries. If so....the iPod is for you.

Title: Excellent product except the handle
Content:
I love this new heater.  It's got everything I ever want in a heater...except the handle.  It's got an awkward handle that loses grip all the time if i want to move it around the house.  Otherwise, a perfect heater.  Works really fast, size is excellent, it's attractive and does not take up alot of spaces unlike some other heaters i've seen.

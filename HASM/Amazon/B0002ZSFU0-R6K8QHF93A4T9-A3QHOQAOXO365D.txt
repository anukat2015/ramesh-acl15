Title: One Awesome Vacuum
Content:
This vacuum is everything I was looking for in a vacuum for my apartment.  It has enough power for what I need and everything is designed very well, from the attachment holders to the control panel.  
Also as mentioned by other reviews, this thing is very light and easy to move around.  I also like the option of either using the reusable cloth dust bag or the disposable paper bag.

Title: Worth buying
Content:
Bought a Frappe Maker for our daughter for her birthday.  She loved it and made her dad one.  That same night I had to order dad a maker.  He received it yesterday and has already used it today.  I am not a coffee lover but the maker also makes tea drinks.  I have not tried it yet but our daughter made the tea drink and said it was also very good.  I feel, as well as my daughter and my husband, that this product is well worth buying.  It works great and is streamline so it doesn't take up much counter or storage space.  Highly recommend this product.

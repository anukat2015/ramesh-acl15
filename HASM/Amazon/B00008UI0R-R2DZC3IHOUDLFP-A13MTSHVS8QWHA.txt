Title: Excellent and Troublesome - all at once
Content:
We have had our Hoover WindTunnel Bagless Canister for over a year, and so far we love it and hate it.
Love:  works exactly as advertised, with solid attachments, a good powerhead, easy to carry or pull along, easy to swap attachments, very good cleaning on a wide variety of surfaces.  Bagless container is easy to empty with a minimum of fuss.
Hate:  the controls on the handle sometimes stop responding after the unit has been used for more than 30 minutes.  While their location is convenient, they are also prone to getting accidently pressed during use, especially when using the hand-held tools.  The bagless container looks larger than it is.  The max-fill line sits below the suspended cone filter, making the actual content capacity of this container very small.  Owners of pets will find the container hits that line in less than one room's worth of vacuuming.  Letting it collect beyond that line impacts performance and creates a mess when emptying the container.  Not especially convenient for carpeted stairs; using the small vacuum-powered hand tool for this would take all day.
All said, it works very well most of the time and for a wide variety of surfaces.  However, the dirt container design and sporadic problems with the power switches would keep us from purchasing this same unit again.

Title: Very Nice Camera
Content:
Very nice camera.  I am a long time Nikon user and while their lenses have become less sturdy over the years, they are still very good glass (at least until after rough handling, then they become less sharp -- this is a departure from the lenses which made Nikon great historically which seemed to be able to withstand much more abuse).  So now that I own three or four good lenses, I'm somewhat married to their bodies.
Anyway, this was a fairly big upgrade.  Not cheap, and it is replacing an 8 year old D100 (not a bad camera, but 8-years is pretty old in digital camera years).
Why the D700?  In a word "FX" or full size sensor, so that the lenses behave as they would on a 35mm camera (vis-a-vis their focal length).  Of the options for Nikon body with FX sensor, this was the cheaper model.  
Am I happy?  Certainly! I love the camera and it takes wonderful photos.  It is a little heavier than the D100, but it is sturdy and takes superb photos.  Menus are fairly well laid out and powerful.  I've had difficulty dealing with the camera's RAW output (.nef files), but I think it is just a matter of modernizing my software.
What's new in the past 8 years?  Wow, a lot more than I would have guessed.  Ask me again in six months (I've only had the body for a month now).  Low light shooting really stands out.  You can shoot at 6400 ISO and get pretty good results -- pretty amazing actually.
Why 4-stars, not five?  Price.

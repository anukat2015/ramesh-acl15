Title: ok, except for a few big issues
Content:
disclaimer: my previous laptop was a thinkpad with XP, so my expectations from a laptop are fairly high.
Pros:
1. i bought a decent configuration, the machine runs fast. (at least for now)
2. It fairly light for a laptop this size.
3. speakers seem ok so far, (dont expect too much from a laptop anyway)
cons:
1. one of my biggest turnoffs is that the harddrive has a very strong vibration, which i can feel through the palm-rest and keyboard. This is annoying the hell out of me. you can even hear it if you come close enough
2. I also felt the body was a bit weak and shaky, compared to my thinkpad. DOnt care about the bright white keyboard panel either.
3. a minor issue is that the screen can only go back so far. So if you like to flaten out ur screen and use it laying on ur back. This will restrict ur ability.
4. I am still adjusting to Vista, so some pain there
the laoptop is also crashing my wireless router. still have to figure out the issue.

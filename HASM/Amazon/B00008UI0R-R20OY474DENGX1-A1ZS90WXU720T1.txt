Title: Belt keeps coming off... DON'T BUY!!!
Content:
The belt keeps coming off... sometimes immediately after having put the belt back on and turning it on.  HORRIBLE!
I contacted Hoover Customer service and will bring the vacuum to the service center tomorrow... but based on the previous reviews about this problem... it won't be fixed.  Save your money!!!!!  Hoover literally sucks a$$$$$$$.

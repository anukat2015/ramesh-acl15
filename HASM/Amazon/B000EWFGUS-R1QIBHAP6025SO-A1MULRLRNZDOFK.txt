Title: Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker
Content:
This coffee maker works well but is bigger than I would have liked - it takes up quite a bit of room on my counter and has a short cord. I have to pull it out from under my kitchen cupboards for enough room to open the lid to pour in water or to clean it. However, it brews quickly and well and keeps the coffee hot, and the carafe pours without dribbling, AND it's the same 'sexy' red as my new Hamilton Beach toaster!

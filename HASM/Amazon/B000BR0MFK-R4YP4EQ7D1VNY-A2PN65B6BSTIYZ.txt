Title: A Great iPod for Someone With a Medium Sized Music Collection
Content:
The 3rd Generation iPod Nano is my third iPod--my first one was a 4G iPod Classic (20GB) and then I got a 2G 2GB iPod shuffle.  I have had the 3G iPod Nano for about a year and I love it--I recently got an iPhone 3G but I'm still carrying around my Nano because it does one thing really well--it is an excellent mp3 player.  The Nano is small, lightweight, and easy to hold in my hand.  It is not too bulky to slip into my pocket on the go like my iPhone or my previous iPod classic is.  It's also nice that it has a screen (unlike the shuffle) which makes it easier to select music to listen to.  And it's perfect for someone with a medium sized music collection like me--I can still carry around most of my music without having to worry about running out of space.
I would not recommend the Nano for video viewing or games, because its screen is very small and hard to see.  I don't find the click wheel a very satisfying controller for games--the touch screen on an iPod Touch or and iPhone is much more satisfying.  But as a music player the Nano is great--I hope to be carrying mine well into the future.

Title: iPod classic has big problem with tv out function
Content:
The new iPod classic has a big problem for all users of the photo and video functions. You cannot display photos, videos or video podcasts on your TV screen, as you cannot change the TV out function on the iPod from OUT to ON.   If you want to see your videos fromthe iPod on the TV screen, then do not buy the iPod classic until Apple has fixed this problem.

Title: Love it but... the control handle does break very quickly
Content:
I really like the suction and cleaning power of the machine.  I'm quite happy with it - especially for the price.  But, as other buyers have experienced, the control mechanism in the handle breaks - within days!  What appears to be happening is that the wires that run from the machine to the control buttons get crimped (they run through the hose).  To fix the problem (rather than engage in a warranty return), I grab the hose at the crimp and squeeze...the controls begin to operate again.

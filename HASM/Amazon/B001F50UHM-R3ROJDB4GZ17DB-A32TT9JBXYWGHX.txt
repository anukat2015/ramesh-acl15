Title: Great replacement for my Ipod shuffle!
Content:
I  bought this Mp3 player because my Ipod shuffle broke and I needed a new one. I went to the store with the idea purchasing a new one I compared the price of this item and with the shuffle and went with the Mp3 player. For a few dollars more I can see pictures watch videos and listen to the radio. The I pod equelivent to this item is like 150 bucks in this economy you got to go cheaper plus sony is a brand I trusted in the past when cd walkmans where the norm. I like how you can upload music from windows media player wich is realy easy and most people already have it on threre computers. I higly recomend this Item.

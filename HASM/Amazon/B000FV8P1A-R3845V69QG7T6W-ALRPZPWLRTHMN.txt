Title: Don't Waste Your Money
Content:
Right away I was disappointed with the amount of noise the fan generated on this heater.  It would randomly transition from a smooth fan noise to a loud griding sound.  Also, the digital controls would sometimes shut the heater down and would not allow the heater to be turned back on unless unpluged.  I am assuming this is some safety feature that was shutting the unit down unnecessarily.  Eventually the heater completely died on me after only 6 months.

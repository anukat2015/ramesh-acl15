Title: Mediocre
Content:
I've owned various iPods for 6 years now and am disappointed that they have not evolved. The Nano is small, and looks ok. I'll list the pros and cons:
Pros:
- Small, compact and rugged flash memory
- Integrates well with iTunes
Cons:
- At $150 (MSRP) for 4GB its overpriced
- 4GB is not enough
- Selective placement of "checked" music using iTunes, causes problems when trying to play multiple tracks in iTunes
- iTunes is buggy and very invasive software
- Must use with iTunes. Does not work with subscription music.
- Must sync with only one computer - very limiting
- Display and font size is too small to see clearly
After having used iTunes and iPods for 6 years, I tried Rhapsody subscription with a Sansa View, ibiza, my Sonos system and TiVo. I'm much happier with Rhapsody subscription. It streams seamlessly throughout my house and I can download onto multiple MP3 players from ANY computer! Bye bye iPods!

Title: This vacuum sucks, and not in a good way...
Content:
We have two 20 lb dogs, both with white coats of hair, so it naturally gets everywhere. So, I researched amazon.com, along with Consumer Reports, and anywhere else I could read reviews. So, for the price, I thought this was a sound vacuum to go with. When we first bought this vacuum, it worked really well, however the canister is small, so you have to empty it every time you vacuumed. 
Now almost 6 months later, the front motor doesn't work! I was hoping it was just a broken belt, but as it turns out, it was the motor inside. Now I'm kicking myself because I wish I would have bought the extra warranty plan! Normally I don't, because this hardly happens. But we wasted our Christmas giftcard on this, and now we have to spend our own money to replace it. Thanks Bissell! You suck!!!

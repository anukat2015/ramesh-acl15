Title: Mine just caught on fire!
Content:
I loved this coffee maker when I got it for Christmas 2007. I joined a coffee club and my k-cups were soon filling up my pantry closet. I loved it so much that I bought one for my daughter and her husband. Theirs stopped working altogether 8 months after they got it. Mine started acting up after 9 months, taking 10 minutes between brews for the water to heat up for the next cup. (Certainly not ideal when you have company.) I de-scaled, as instructed, and took very good care of the machine. But this morning, after it was done brewing a cup of coffee, I heard a loud "pop" and turned around to see flames shooting up behind it. The fire was out quickly, and no real damage was done, aside from a blown circuit breaker and outlet. The machine, however, is toast - after less than one year of use.  
Whie the machine was working, I thought the coffee was above average. But the reliabilty of this model is poor, and the workmanship VERY questionable. I doubt I'll be replacing this with another Keurig.

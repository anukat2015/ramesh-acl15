Title: If you like a spot light in your face, you will like this product.
Content:
I bought this because of the solid reviews. This is one of the few products I have purchased and found the positive reviews to be lacking a critical detail, the brightness of this heater.  I thought this would be similar to what they sell at Custco, it's not. It's ten times brighter. It is so bright its like placing a spot light in your room.  If you buy it, be prepared to buy a spot light.
I will likely return mine

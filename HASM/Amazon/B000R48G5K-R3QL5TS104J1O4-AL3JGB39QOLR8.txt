Title: Not really worth the effort
Content:
To be fair, the product does not claim to be an air conditioner. However, it does claim to cool 12 degrees cooler, which I didn't find at all. I live in a dry Colorado climate, and still it is barely cooler than a fan. You have to fill it with tons of ice to even get that, and it requires refilling with water and ice often. If you don't clean it at least once a week, it starts smelling really bad.
All this effort of refilling and cleaning is not worth the 3 to 5 degrees cooler you get. For that, I'd rather just plug in a fan and not have to worry about it every day. Save your money and buy a portable air conditioner. It's worth the extra investment, trust me.

Title: Great.. when it works
Content:
I got my mini the first day it came out at my local store.  I've waited 3 years to buy a player of this caliber, and thought this finally was the one I wanted.It's been 5 days, and its broken!!  It stopped in the middle of a song and froze.  There is no re-set button on this, and the battery is not one that can be removed.   Translation:  needs to be taken back.  This is the problem I feared when I saw that the battery was built in, and my fear was realized not even 1 week into it.When it worked, it did sound great.  I had it hooked up with my Bose headphones and the sound was equal of that to my home stereo system, which is impressive.  My gut feeling here is that it's new and the software probably has some bugs.  I'm going to exchange it and get a new one, and see if this problem recurs.  My only other knock is itunes.  I just don't care for the s/w.. it's not very user friendly.

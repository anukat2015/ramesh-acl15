Title: A BIG FIRE HAZARD!
Content:
I purchased a Big Buddy heater for our vacation cabin based on my positive experience with the little buddy.  Big mistake!  The Big Buddy is unreliable using disposable cartridges and a FIRE HAZARD using a remote 20lb tank.  Mr. Heater should recall this product forthwith!
The Big Buddy worked fine on full speed using disposable cartridges - for about an hour and a half.  Then it started shutting itself down with increasing frequency.  It ran longer on half speed, but still exhibited the same problem.  Save yourself some money - buy a little buddy and a battery powered fan.
Of course, the problem with disposable cartridges is that Big Buddy sucks them down so fast they're economically and environmentally unfeasible.  I connected the unit to a remote tank using the same Mr. Heater hose that worked successfully with it's little brother.  The primary problem seems to be the internal regulator freezes up.  This causes propane to become trapped in the unit.  It then explodes when you attempt to relight.  I also had the unit "flame up" before the regulator froze completely.  My experience is certainly not consistent with a unit advertised as "safe for indoor use".
For the record, I returned my first unit thinking I'd just gotten a lemon.  Unfortunately, I've had the same problems with the replacement.
In summary, I'd strongly recommend the Big Buddy - if you need the financial proceeds from your fire insurance policy!

Title: Hoover canister vac
Content:
This is a surprisingly powerful vac with some great features. I had never owned a Hoover before (always Kenmore) or a bagless vac, but decided to give it a try. I love the telescoping wand. It is lightweight and easy to manuever. My only gripe is that the power cord is a bit on the short side.

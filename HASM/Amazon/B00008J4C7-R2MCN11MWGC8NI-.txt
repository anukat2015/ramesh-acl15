Title: Not worth the money
Content:
We had a Dirt Devil that lasted over 10 years. It was great. This unit is a poor performer compared to the old $50 Dirt Devil. It doesn't pick up dirt well(has poor suction.) The filters are expensive to replace and they must be replaced. Just because it is bagless doesn't mean it does not have filters. The HEPA filter needs to be changed (or delicately cleaned) ever 10 or so uses or it plugs up. 
  
 Oh, and ours lasted a grand total of 4 months before the motor died. Check the warranty!

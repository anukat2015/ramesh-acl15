Title: Maybe I'm doing something wrong...
Content:
Had the same pot for years but let water get into the base socket and it rusted out. Always enjoyed the great flavor. Bought the new one in June and by Aug it doesn't brew the coffee completely, producing a weak cup of java. Other complaints I've read echo this same problem. I tried a number of things including ice cold water even with ice chips trying to bring back the old flavor. No luck. We buy coffee ten cans at a time and tried water/coffee brands/cleaning/etc., all those combo's but just colored water as the final product. Any ideas???I'm now going to find out about warranty info....be careful...I hope it's just a defective one and not a company trying to cut corners. Miss that cup of coffee.

Title: wish I found this gem a long time ago!
Content:
Wow, I have nothing but good things to say about this coffeemaker. It does not drip from the spout when pouring, the resevoir is removable, and the coffee filter basket is easy to get to. If there is anything bad is that the filter basket holder itself is not removable, so it can only be cleaned by wiping it out. This makes really good coffee, and its very fast too. If you use the flavor selector button, this does slow the coffee brewing time somewhat, but who cares? The benefits of this coffeemaker far outweigh any negative ones. I also like the bright blue clock on the machine, the sleek look and the easy clean black color. I love it! The price can't be beat either!!! I wish I could have one in red to match my rooster kitchen!
UPDATE: After buying this coffee maker again in June 2009, I have to say I quite disappointed with it. My first one last two years, and I only bought a new because of the burned up warming plate. However, my second one has a crusty, burned up warm plate already, and I mean as of last Nov. not today. I have started using my old Hamilton Beach coffee maker, but it takes forever to brew. What iss the deal with Michael Graves warming plate always doing this? Does anyone else have this problem with this coffeemaker?

Title: This thing is crap
Content:
Hard to load. Hard to orginize. Songs load out of sequence(rough when you load groups like Pink Floyd,Marillion, and Styx). Loading pics is a study in computer engeneering. Video? Forget it.
It takes a special program just to down load from you tube!
Want a good MP3 that is easy to use? Buy Creative. I had a 1GB Creative Nano that worked better than this thing.
I bought it on sale, no wonder it was half off!

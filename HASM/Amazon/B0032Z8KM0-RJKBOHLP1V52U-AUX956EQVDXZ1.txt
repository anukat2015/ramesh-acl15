Title: Gateway NV5370u 15.6 inch laptop - Love it!!!
Content:
Of course this is my FIRST laptop so I don't have much to compare to but I absolutely love it!  It has all the features, built in's and programs that I need and more.  I can finally multi task and keep up with the jones!!  :)
There are however just a couple lil things I'm having issues with...  The battery life is only about 3 hours and I didn't realize how fast that REALLY flies...  So that's a bit of a bummer.  
I absolutely needed and wanted the number pad on the right like on a regular keyboard but I was disappointed to see the decimal point is on the top and so I'm not as quick as I used to be keying in figures. But that may just be a matter of getting used to...  Still glad I got one with the number key.
Lastly, my biggest pet peeve is that the mousepad (also taking some time to get used to) is not centered right in the middle of the laptop.  I'm funny about having things being all even and this is mostly a 'look' issue.  If the mousepad was centered, the number keys like a desktop keyboard and a longer lasting battery, this would be absolutely PERFECT!
Overall I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone.  I can watch a movie, play a game, chat on IM and go through email with ease and of course with Windows 7, it just makes it all the more easier!!
If I had to do it all over again, I would still get this one in an instant!!  
Can't beat the price either.  After all said and done, I paid just under $600 which was about $400 less than what I was expecting to pay!!  Kudos to Gateway for a great laptop!!

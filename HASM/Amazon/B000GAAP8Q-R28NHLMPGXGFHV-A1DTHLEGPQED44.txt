Title: Worthless piece of...
Content:
My experience with IPod went ok for the first few months even though I hated the proprietary format that force you to convert all your mp3 and wma formats to apple format which is tedious, then suddenly the player stopped working 1 week after the warranty expired, so the store told me to take it to an apple store maybe they can help, after waiting 45 minutes to talk to one of the employees there
(at the Genius Bar!!) the genius dude checked the player and told me it's a hard drive failure, and can't do anything about it but if I wanted I could get 10% off on my next IPod purchase however since I don't enjoy pain I bought a creative player instead which has more and better features than IPod less the hype..., when I was exiting the store a thought occurred to me that thank god my desktop and laptop at home were not apple products! And god bless Microsoft for saving the world after all from Apple tyranny and  Unix Vi .

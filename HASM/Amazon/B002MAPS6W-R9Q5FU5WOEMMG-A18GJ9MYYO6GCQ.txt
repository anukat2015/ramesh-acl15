Title: Just keeps getting better
Content:
Having owned a 2GB Sansa Clip (which didn't have a memory card slot) for two years, and having used it almost every day to listen to various downloaded podcasts, I decided to upgrade to the 8GB model.   All the benefits of the old model, most particularly the ease of moving files using the Windows "move files" function, remain.  I was delighted to realize that one function I would have appreciated on the 2GB clip is now present: files can be deleted on the device, so there is no need to connect to a computer to do this.

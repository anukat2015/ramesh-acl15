Title: Good computer but...
Content:
I bought this computer from amazon. I've been using it for about a week when suddenly it just die. I called the tech support and told me to set my computer on an out-of-box state, I did it twice and didn't solve the problem, so I sent it to the toshiba depot and the diagnostic was the video card has problems.
I think is because an overheating problem with the gpu, I think it needs a better cooling system. I used it as the manual says, on a flat surface, no dust, etc... and even with that I got the problem.
So it is a good computer but toshiba has to improve its cooling system in their laptops.

Title: GREAT!
Content:
this heater is a life saver! my room mate and i are too cheap to have the heater on all the time. when we are home we have it on at a tolerable 65 degrees and turn it off when we leave the apartment. the heater is a great way to save on the bills and is eco-friendly. it heats up my room very well and pretty fast.
i decided to get lasko just because my boss has one in his office and i do like it. i also saw it at wal-mart and for only 45 dollars (w00t) and it's up for 75 bucks on the lasko website (double w00t) so it was a good deal!
the bad:
-the digital display is on top of the heater. it's inconvenient when i want to see the digital display screen from my bed
-no fan only option
the good!:
-quiet enough for me to fall asleep to (and i'm a light sleeper!)
-comes with a cute little remote controller with the same buttons as the heater and is very convenient if you don't want to get out of bed
-the heater beeps when you use the remote on it to show that it gets the command
-very cool feature: the auto option is great! let's say i have it set to 75 degrees. the heater will heat up to 77 degrees and temporarily shut off till the room cools down to 74 degrees. then the heater starts up again and the cycle keeps continuing till you or the timer shuts it off. i usually have this on when i'm sleeping and have no worries about being too hot. 
-a timer that goes up to 8 hours
-high, low, or automatic setting
-can turn from side to side only on the high and auto setting
-compact
-has a handle in the back for easy carrying
i've had this heater only for a month, but i can tell it's going to last for a long while! because of it, i'm going to trust lasko!! i highly recommend this heater. as you can see, the good outweighs the bad!

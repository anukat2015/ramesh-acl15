Title: Excellent Product - Highy Recommended
Content:
Excellent product, works just as described.
This unit normally turns on when it drops 1 degree below the temperature and turns off 2 degrees above when you set it to automatic.  It oscillates perfectly and the remote works well also.  
The only downfall like others have said is you cannot read the temperature LED especially when the device is elevated.  The temperature LED should be on the front of the device so you can see it. 
Otherwise get this!  Highly recommended and I have had zero problems.  It's a steal at this price.

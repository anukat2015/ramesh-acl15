Title: DeLongui HHP1500-not reliable
Content:
I bought this heater last year in a desperate attempt to heat our family room in the basement. It worked ok, not very hot for one year. Recently when the cold hit the house the heater just stopped heating. I'm tired of buying unreliable heaters! HELP!
Note: Last year when we were using it a lot, the eletric bill went sky high!

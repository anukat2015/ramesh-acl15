Title: Pets disturbed by sound effects
Content:
This is an ok capable space heater, but it makes a lot of humming and popping noises, which distressed the pets who were supposed to benefit from it.  I can put on a sweater, but I worried that the birds were getting too cold. So in the end, I broke down, and bought some firewood. I will keep the heater - it might be useful next year.

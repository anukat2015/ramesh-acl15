Title: Saves money on the electric bill
Content:
Remember those old kerosene heaters that smoked while they were burning, and stunk up the whole house? My dad had one. The smell used to make me sick to my stomach. Well, this isn't one of those heaters. There is a slight odor for about three minutes after you ignite it. While it's heating I don't smell it at all. I've used this heater every day this winter. It DOES take a while to heat up a room. But after I've had it running for about three hours it gets nice and toasty. Then my electric baseboard heat stays off. I save about $75.00 a month on my electric bill using this heater in my living room (15ft x 25ft). And I spend about $25.00 a month on kerosene for this heater. My only gripe is that the fuel tank doesn't hold near as much as they advertise. And 12 hours on one tank is definitely stretching it. It's more like 6-8 hours MAX. On the other hand, 2 gallons of kerosene lasts me a week. Cheap heat! I might buy another one.

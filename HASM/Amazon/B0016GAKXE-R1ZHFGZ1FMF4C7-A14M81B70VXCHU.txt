Title: Horrible Merchandise
Content:
I bought this player and when it arrived, it was defective. wouldn't charge, wouldn't even detect in XP or Vista. Got an exchange and the replacement was ALSO a dud. Unless the buyer knew they were purchasing a pallet full of duds and trying to make a quick buck (it happens), Coby is a no-brainer.Don't buy this brand. I think they might spit out a good one per 1000 of product but that's an optimistic total.

Title: Priced well, works as advertised, and simple to install
Content:
I'm somewhat amused by the previous review. If you cut yourself twice using simple scissors to open a plastic box, then perhaps home improvement is not your forte. Based on that, I would question the reviewer's credibility, your call.
It was simple to install (less than 10 minutes, comes with stickers to label the wires, and instructions are as good as any you'd expect) and it works as advertised. If you don't need a bunch of bells and whistles (we did not need each day programmed differently) and want an accurate digital reading, I recommend this. The Hunter brand when it comes to fans is stalwart, so I bought this with that in mind.

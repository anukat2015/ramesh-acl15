Title: MacBook Pro and Amazon's customer service
Content:
I purchased the MacBook Pro from Amazon about three weeks ago.  After two weeks, the MacBook screen became distorted and the resolution would fade in and out as I moved the screen up and down.  I took it to an Apple store and the tech advised me that the computer was defective ( wiring issue ) and I should return it to Amazon..... I contacted Amazon and within 24 hours I had a new MacBook Pro in my lap and the instructions to return the defective one.  I love the Mac and I love Amazon's hassle free customer service more!

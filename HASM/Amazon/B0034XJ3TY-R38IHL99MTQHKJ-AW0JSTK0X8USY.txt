Title: Another great ASUS laptop!
Content:
Love ASUS .. have never had a problem with any of their products.  The N71JQ-A1 is replacing a M71 that's about 2 years old.  The N71 has a good quad processor, good storage capacity, good video card and the blu-ray drive.  Comes with 2-320gb drives - not sure why ASUS partitions the 2nd drive into 2.  The boot drive, okay, I understand partially.  There is one partition that holds all the recovery files.  But they divided up the remaining into 2 portions - I would have liked the boot drive to have had 1 partition for the recovery files and then the rest as another partition, and the 2nd drive a full 320gb.  But, not a big issue.  I did upgrade the memory to 8gb.  And I got a new Dell U2410 monitor to go with the unit - so I get full HD at 1900x1200.  With the blu-ray drive you get a really nice picture.  Totally recommend this laptop!

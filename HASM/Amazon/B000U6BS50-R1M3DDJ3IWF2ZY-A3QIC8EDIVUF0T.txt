Title: Basically an electric broom
Content:
The product is fairly good at picking things up, but I would not buy this if you are looking for something to really vacuum your hard floors...I will say that the filter gets dirty quickly and once it is the vacuum definitely doesn't pick up much, and the battery life is not that great so vacuum quickly...Great if you want to knock the surface dirt off the floors, but if your floors are really dusty, I would sweep them with a regular broom first and then use this to suck up the dirt.

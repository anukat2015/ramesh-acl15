Title: HP laptops have long term quality issue
Content:
We have experienced quality problems right after warranty time: 
1- Our $1066 laptop began to have dead pixels after a year and went completely dead after 2 years. 
2- Battery charging plug has problems with intermittent on/off.  This is also right after 1 year.  
They seem to design things for 1 year -- smart cost-saving strategy!

Title: I Hate It!
Content:
I absolutely hate this vacuum. Here are my reasons:
1. It does not come with a floor nozzle. Nor will floor nozzles from other vacuums fit this vacuum. The extension tube included is too short and is not standard so nothing else will fit on it. There are places on a floor where this vacuum cannot reach, so you need a floor nozzle. Thus, you are screwed.
2. It is very loud. Too loud.
3. The handle is very uncomfortable.
4. The power switch is in an awkward position and hard to reach. It should be on the handle.

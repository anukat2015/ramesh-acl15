Title: Great Computer
Content:
It does everything it needs to do for the price.  It's powerful enough to run programs like Photoshop/Flash efficiently and do just about anything even the above-averaged user would need.  It's not a great gaming laptop, but it will run games fine, just not the latest and greatest with high framerates.
It looks beautiful and the number pad next to the qwerty keyboard is absolutely awesome.  The touchpad is flush with the surface of the laptop's casing, but it's actually better that way once you get used to it.
All in all, for the price, it's a damn good and pretty looking computer.

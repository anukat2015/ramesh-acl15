Title: Well Played, Krups
Content:
I was a bit concerned after reading all the reviews about the plasticy taste.  The coffee I made from day one was phenomenal.  There was nothing like a plastic taste at all.  Yum!
I love how long the coffee stays hot in the carafe.  It's always hot without being superheated.  The carafe has a pretty big lip around the top to help keep everything warm, so it can be a bit difficult to get the last cup or two out.  But I am an able bodied person and can work that extra bit to get every last drop out.
The bubble in the water gage?  The reviews make it sound like it can't be fixed.  When the coffee maker is empty (no water or no carafe) just tip the unit back a bit until the bubble goes away.  Easy as pie.  To prevent the bubble from ever forming, it's a good idea to pour the water smoothly.  It sounds silly but it works.
I highly recommend this coffee maker.  It is just as good as my french press with less grounds in the coffee and less mess to clean up.  Enjoy!

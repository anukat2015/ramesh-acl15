Title: Quite pleased
Content:
We haven't bought a canister vacuum in a decade. Hoover has done well with this machine. Great suction, reasonably light weight, thoughtful design. It would be nicer if some of the extra nozzles were stored on or in the machine (as some parts are), but this is a minor annoyance given the good performance we experience.

Title: Iffy at best
Content:
This item is very flimsy.  I bought two of these. One for each of my older teenage sons.  I did not realize at the time that I bought them that A) The only way to charge them was plugged into a computer, and B) there was NO carrying case available for them.  They have had them for three weeks now and already one has fallen from a coat pocket to the floor.  A waist height drop should not destroy modern  electronics, but this one is now destroyed.  In addition, it does not truly play MP3's.  You MUST use their software to put music on the player.  You also must register the player in order to use the player on more than one computer.  I have several computers networked at my house, and SONY does not need all my personal info.  So, in order to go from one computer to the next, the player must be wiped before reloading music on it.  On a positive note, before it was dropped, the sound quality was good.  That is the only good thing I can say about it.  If they would market it with a belt carrying case, or an armband case, it might be worth the risk of carrying around.  However, as a stand alone, it is a little too expensive to risk falling out of your pocket.

Title: NEW MODEL AVAILABLE
Content:
My research found reports rating the "A" model below average for noise and handling so I delayed buying. Then I noticed some sites offering a "B" version (EL-7020B). Electrolux said the new version has a new "quiet clean" powerhead and a synthetic anti-odour bag (which is still an S-bag style and is totally interchageable with all other S-bags).
So, whith this in mind, I purchased the new "B" model and can attest the power head is in fact very quiet an will turn both ways improving the handling. More time needed to rate reliability otherwise I would give it 5-stars.

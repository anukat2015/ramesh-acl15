Title: great price for a GOOD DSLR
Content:
i studied photography for five years as my major in college..  the was when DSLR was a reachable dream.  then i left school to join the army... which i am proud that i did but i had to put photo to the back..  now i have a year left and have a goal of getting back into photography. but i ran into a prob...  i know film.. not digital..  a lot of stuff has changed.. the basics are there but the way we go about it has changed.. my film camera is a n90s.. great great film camera.. i was looking for something along that line when looking for dslr, but money is kinda tight, being new to the digital side, i looked at the canon 7d..  great camera but could not swing the cash.. i decided to go with the xsi.. yes it is not the low end pro camera.. but man it puts out some good quality stuff.. i am still learning it.. and still need to get speedlight, battery back grip, and some better glass (lens).
the kit lens is a good start.. if you can i would just get the body and get a lens that has an f-stop of 2.8 or get a good speedlight.  the pop up flash can be kinda harsh and has very short coverage but you can dial it + / - 2 stops/good for fill in day light. 
the body is wicked light.. feels like a kids toy.. if you want heavy stay away from the rebel line the "pro" lines are more solid..  that is one reason i want the vertical grip.. makes it a bit more beefy. 
the one thing that just blows me away about dslr.. is i have any film, film speed, color or b&w i want with me, outstanding.  
if you want to get into dslr and am kinda overwhelmed may i suggest the xsi.  it is a GOOD camera.

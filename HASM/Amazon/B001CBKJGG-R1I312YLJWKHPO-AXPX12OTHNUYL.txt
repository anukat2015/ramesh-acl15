Title: Great dLSR for a good price
Content:
I'm still learning about all of the camera's possibilities.  Got some great stop-motion pictures of small birds and dogs.  Picture quality is excellent.
  I did a lot of research before I bought this camera.  I don't find the focus dots to be a problem.  I like the controls on the right side, they're easy to operate and the camera fits my hand just fine. 
  There were a few reviews talking about the camera getting damp and never operating again.  To prevent condensation, I follow the Canon recommendation of removing the lens from the body when coming in from the cold to a warm room.  I've even done it (carefully) after getting back into a warm car.  The camera and lens don't take long to warm up.  
  This is one of the lightest dSLRs on the market, a real plus when adding a telephoto lens.

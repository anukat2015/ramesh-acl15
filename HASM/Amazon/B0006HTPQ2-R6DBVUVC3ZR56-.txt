Title: I never...
Content:
Tought that I would be writing a bad review on an iPod... as you can see from the 1 star this is another one of those "hate iPod" review... like I said before I never tought I would be writing this... cuz I wanted an iPod mini so much! And oh how much I enjoyed the first 2 weeks I had with it, only 2 weeks because that was the time it took to break...
The screen simply broke in two, I never crashed it into anything... I took care of that thing like it was the most important thing of my life, and oddly it was!! I even washed my hands before using it not to make the click-wheel dirty... and the thing just crashes... it works fine but with a crashed screen... and for the price I paid I would expect it to last a little longer that what it did... now the tech support won't change it since they think that I dropped it... and like that wasn't enough they returned it to me with a problem on the click-wheel!!! When I click on the menu it stucks some time...
I went from iPod lover to wanting to smash my iPod mini into pieces in no time... and it makes me feel good that I'll never spent not even a dime on another apple product... specially in an iPod... and hopefully you'll listen to me and won't buy this crap...
but then again I don't think you will cuz when I used to love, I never paid attention to reviews like these... but when your iPod breaks, wich it will, since it's crap... just read this: "Told you so..."

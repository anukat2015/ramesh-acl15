Title: R2D2 Works Like a Charm
Content:
My ancient Oreck upright finally sucked in its last bit of air at the age of 30. I analyzed my real cleaning needs and decided it was time for a canister vac, since our floors are wood and tile with just a few area rugs. South Florida has peculiar cleanling issues, too. Several reviews later, I found this model Hoover and read nothing discouraging about it except for the weight. No one stocked this machine within all of South Florida, so I ordered it from Amazon. I didn't have to pay shipping and it arrived right away.  The machine cleans thoroughly and it easy to operate, although it is weighty; I particularly love the fact that there are no bags, it has a HEPA filter and no dust escaping into the air. My one slight negative about it is that it could have better suction on the carpets (it is true that there is nothing like an upright for this)however, my house has not been this clean since we first moved in six years ago.  I highly recommend this machine to anyone who has a lot of tile to sweep and sliding glass door troughs to clean. It takes up one whole side of a closet when stored, so I wouldn't advise this for someone living in a limited amount of space.  Well worth the money so far--I have had this just a couple of months.

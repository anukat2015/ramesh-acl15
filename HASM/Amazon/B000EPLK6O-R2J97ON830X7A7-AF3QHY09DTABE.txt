Title: Look elsewhere
Content:
I have a two other Zojirushi products, the hot water dispenser and the rice maker. They are both brilliant products that work well and are well made.
While made to a high standard the Zutto coffee maker is a borderline product. The hot plate that is built into the Zutto keeps the coffee too hot, quickly (minutes) causing it to 'cook' and go bad after brewing.
I recommend you look for another machine that uses a thermal carafe if you want drinkable coffee after the first cup.

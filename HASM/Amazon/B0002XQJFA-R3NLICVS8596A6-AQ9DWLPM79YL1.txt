Title: Not for people on a budget
Content:
As another reviewer rightly mentioned, there are a few basic things that this camera can do better in. 
Same time, there are a few things that no other prosumer dSLR does as well as the canon 20D. Eg., sports photography. With 5 fps, this camera Rocks. Whereas, with its bad white balance, this camera is not the best in its class for indoor with lowlight photography. Same goes for Macro mode - Spot metering is just so dear to macro photographers that it is very dissappointing not to have it in such an expensive camera.
If you can afford more than one camera (as most professionals do), then yes, get this camera for your sports and outdoor shooting needs and get a different one for doing your indoor, lowlight and macro shooting needs.
But if you are on a budget like most of us and if you are not going to limit yourself to just sports and outdoor photography, then in my opinion, you would be better off with a different camera - I vote for D70 too. Yes it is just 6 mega pixels but you will really not gain anything with an 8 mega pixel - it is really not a big jump. The professionals will tell you the same.
I give 3 stars only because Canon has a very aggressive marketing strategy and creating a lot of hype around their products. The camera is good, but it has an disproportionate hype to it that could cost some a lot of money...

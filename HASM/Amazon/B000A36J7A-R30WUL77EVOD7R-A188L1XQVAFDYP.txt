Title: Great, Reliable Computer
Content:
I had the Gateway M305CRV for about eight years and it still runs fine to this day.  Sure the fan is a little loud, but this computer will never die.  Mine has even been run over by a car, don't ask, and all i had to do was get the screen replaced and it worked perfectly again.  I get mine cleaned out every 2 years or so, which makes it run like new.  I dont think I know anyone who has a laptop that is eight years old, been through what mine has and still runs. This laptop rules!

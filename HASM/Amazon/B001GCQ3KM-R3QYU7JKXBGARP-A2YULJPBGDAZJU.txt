Title: Uh, it dies ...
Content:
I'm on my 3rd Fuze right now: My first 2 died just after about a month of usage. The first two died while playing a song. I've handled it with care, but regardless it died just after a month! Has this happened to anyone else?
I bought it at BestBuy but aside from the problem of dying, I love it's style, screen, everything about it. 
Hopefully, this one won't die like the last two. 
I rate it a 4.5/5 (not considering it dying), but with the problem 3.5/5

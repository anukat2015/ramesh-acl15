Title: Good Uno and Bad Uno!
Content:
I got the Eureka Uno for free so I can't complain but I will point out some 'faults' that I find with it.  I like the bagless part, though the cup has no easy handle to grab onto to empty it.  It seems to pick things up well, I have no complaints there at all.  I do find this vac exhausting!  It makes my arm ache for quite a while after using and doesn't do much for my back either.  The round handle is pretty cool, I like being able to change the length of it and being able to hold on to it different ways.  I do love the paw, makes cleaning the furniture out easy as well as smaller carpet areas where the vacuum itself won't fit.  
   
     The Uno seems to have a life of its own and requires muscle to keep it running away from you.  The extension hose will also wear you out.....its hard to stretch it out....it wants to 'pull' back on you.  The clips that hold the accessories are useless, everytime I use the vac they all fall off.  The electrical cord is very hard to wind up, they put it right in the center in the back and you have to wind it up without knocking everything else back off and the hooks that you wind it around are not big enough and I usuallly end up leaving some of the cord hanging instead of fighting trying to get it wound all the way.
  Overall I wish they would have put more thought into the design, but like the vacuuming part of it.

Title: A nice small coffee maker
Content:
I was looking for a white small coffee maker that uses cone filters.  I had to decide between DeLonghi and this Cuisinart, and picked this one as this was smaller.
I've read enough bad reviews about it, but I don't have any problems with spillage both pouring water into the machine or pouring coffee out of the carafe, pushing the on/off button, or metallic taste.  I'm very satisfied with this product.

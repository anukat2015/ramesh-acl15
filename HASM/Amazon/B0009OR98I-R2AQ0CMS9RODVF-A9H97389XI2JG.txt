Title: A Metro-vac Fan--A Compact Vac with a Full-Size Kick and More
Content:
Product description was thorough, and the product delivers what was promised--power, manageability, healthy cleaning and easy maintenance. It performs like a full-size vac. While in use, there is no byproduct to irritate/exacerbate allergies. On the contrary, the air feels and smells cleaner. It's perfect for a small household and dorm living, for which it was purchased. Although I've a large household with a central vac system, I intend to purchase an additional Metro Vac for places where no central vac has gone before--the attic and the car. However, I'd like one that is bagless, in which a reusable, cleanable container collects the debris that can be manually disposed. The only criticism concerns the attachments: It would be nice if they could be a little larger.

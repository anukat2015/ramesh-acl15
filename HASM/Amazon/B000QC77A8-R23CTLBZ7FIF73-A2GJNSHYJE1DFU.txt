Title: A nice unit, but a few issues...
Content:
Pros:  Thin profile keeps it against the wall, not underfoot.  Controls are easy to see, with large buttons and a large, bright temperature display; relatively intuitive to operate.  Powerful fan.  Taller than most 1500 watt heaters, but this makes it easy to pick up.  Double insulated for electrical safety.  ETL listed.
Cons:  Does not automatically restart after a power outage.  Automatic temperature regulation works only on "high" (1500 watts) setting.  Fan is relatively loud in the "high" (1500 watt) setting.  Strong "plastic" smell when operating, as someone else reported; hopefully, this will diminish over time.
  
Notes:  Seems to be well built with good materials.  Weighs 14.5 pounds.  Would be very easy to tip over unless placed against a wall.  All plastic case (except for the metal grille) lessens chance of getting burned, but the grille gets quite hot.  Loud beeps when function buttons are pushed.  I bought this heater to keep water pipes in my shop from freezing this winter, but because it doesn't automatically restart after a power outage (a frequent occurrence around here), I'll have to buy another heater for that purpose.  This one will go in the house.

Title: Excellent vacuum and a great price!
Content:
I had been looking for a very good vacuum and had been comparing a much more expensive vacuum made for pet hair and allergies when someone told me to look at Consumer Reports and Popular Mechanics magazines which had ranked vacuums.  I saw that this Wind Tunnel had been ranked as high as the these vacuums but at a fraction of the cost.  Since I've had it, I can't believe the amout of dirt and dust this wonderful machine picks up.  I have allergies and they have been so much less since doing a couple good vacuums with this machine.  Only bad part is that since it does pick up so much dirt, the cup fills up fast.

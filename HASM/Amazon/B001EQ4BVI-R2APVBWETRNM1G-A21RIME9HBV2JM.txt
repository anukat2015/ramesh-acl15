Title: Glad I picked this...
Content:
Over the XSi. I am a happy ex-owner of a (sold) XTi. Upgrading to T1i over the XSi did not interest me, because of its capacity of shooting movies, 15 megapixel resolution and higher price, of course. And the 40D was already out of stock, but that would certainly fill all my needs.
Anyway, about the Canon EOS 50D...
Construction is so solid that makes Rebels look like toys. The feel is comfortable - better grip action requires no battery grip, the weight, and the leather finish avoids slippering. 
I think the top panel is better than LCD controls. Saves battery life, is not as luminous as the LCD, makes your action more discreet (the quieter shutter also helps). 
The shutter should last longer, since its a more advanced body.
Viewfinder is brighter, focusing and shooting (burst) is much faster.
The ISO in thirds is great. It makes your exposures perfect, even if you shoot Jpeg.
There are two things I don't like about this camera: the size of the files, and the Live View. 
15 megapixel is too much for the majority, professional or not. The cards must be huge if you shoot RAW on a social event. Processing them now takes longer with this 15Mb average RAW files. I'd stick to the 10/12 megapixels.
And the Live View feature, according to the manual, can decrease picture quality in some situations. Also, if used to shoot a bright scene, it may damage the curtains/sensor (can't remember now). I rather not to use Live View at all, and never needed - the AF always worked, even on dark situations with the EF 17-40 f/4L USM lens, a relatively dark lens.
Never used a FF camera, but seems to be a step closer to that. 
I recommend the 50D and would buy it again!

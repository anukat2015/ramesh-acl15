Title: Good vaccuum but a little flimsy
Content:
I have 6 cats and a dog in my house and hardwood floors throughout.  I love the fact that it is possible to almost entirely break this vaccuum down for cleaning.  It is light weight and has awesome suction and reach with the handle/hose.  I only have 2 complaints: 1) the top section with the cyclone technology (a bunch of little cups that fill with dirt and hair that have to be cleaned every other time it's used) took days to dry out enough to use it at my house.  I don't know why that is as other people seem to have theirs dry out overnight.  2) the handle broke within 4 months of owning it so that it didn't stay extended.
The only reason I'm looking to replace it is that my cats decided to use it as a litter box when I had it disassembled for cleaning.  We will probably buy another one as it is the only vaccuum my wife and I found that had all the features we both wanted.

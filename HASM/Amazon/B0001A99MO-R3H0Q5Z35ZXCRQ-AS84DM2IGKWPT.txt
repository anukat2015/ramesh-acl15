Title: Great Product Overall
Content:
Received a Mini for X-mas.  Love it.  Enough storage for practical use, well built, sturdy, intuitive controls and menu commands & the perfect size for carrying in a jacket pocket. The "HOLD" button is a great idea to keep from accidentally changing the menu settings (volume, play/pause, skip, etc). Even the earphones are great with a wide dynamic range.  Only faults I've found so far are in the stated battery life and in the control wheel sensitivity.  Do not believe the hype about "..up to 8 hrs."  So far, the most I've been able to get on a full charge is 4 hrs. Perhaps without using the 5 sec backlight delay, the duration might be longer.  The control wheel pad is very sensitive and I often found myself accidentally scrolling past my intended menu selection.  Still, it is a product worth getting.  Personally, it's the best gift I've received in years!

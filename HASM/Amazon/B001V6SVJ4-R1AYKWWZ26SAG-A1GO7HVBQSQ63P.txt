Title: Worth every penny!
Content:
I was so hesitant to spend this much money on a vacuum. This is worth every penny. This is the vacuum you need if you have asthma, allergies or pets. I could not find any other vacuum that had a sealed hepa filter of this quality. Other vacuums have hepa filters but dust, etc can escape around them and back into your air. The bags are high quality with 9 layers and instantly seal when you have to change the bags to provent anything from escaping. The Vacuum is very light and easy to use. The handle is very comfortable and adjustable so your back does not ache. I like that I control all the settings with my foot and I do not have to bend over and the canister is insulated so it reduces the noise while vacuuming. The Miele is a well engineered high quality vacuum. I highly recommend this vacuum.

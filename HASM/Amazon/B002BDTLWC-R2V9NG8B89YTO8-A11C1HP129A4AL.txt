Title: Zen MX 16GB
Content:
I purchased this Zen to replace by Zen Micro Photo player.  I like the look and the feel of this new player.  It seems a bit cumbersome at first trying to find your way through the menus but after a few uses it all makes sense.  My only complaint is the ease of getting my old files (from the Zen Micro) to this newer player.  It seems to me it should be a lot easier than it was.  I think it should have also brought over all my playlists but it did not.  This is not a deal breaker, but it certainly makes switiching a lot more complicated.  Overall, however, the player has great sound and versatility.

Title: Horrible
Content:
My mom and I both bought this vacuum cleaner based on a sales recomendation.  Both of our vacuum handles have broken so we cannot attach the sweeper to the top part of he hose.  I would understand this could be a fluke break if it happened to just one of the vacuums but it happened to both in the exact same spot.  Cheaply made. Would not buy another one again.

Content:
I am a Senior Citizen.  I bought this product on the recommendation of my son.  I'm very pleased with it and am now listening to my favorite music.  I tend to use it when I'm alone, going about my daily chores.  So far, I've synced only from my own collection of CD's, but will download some from the Itunes store when I finish going through my own collection.

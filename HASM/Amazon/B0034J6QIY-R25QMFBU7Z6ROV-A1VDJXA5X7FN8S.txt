Title: Finally a nice brewer that works!
Content:
I purchased the Cuisinart after going through 3 Keurig B70s and a Brevelle since Christmas, (all three were defective with pump problems and very LOUD.) The Brevelle 700 worked okay but had these really annoying flashing lights that flashed all the time "Open Head". The arrow lights were extremely bright and bothersome.
So far the Cuisinart SS700 works really well. Very little noise and the pump works just fine. I like the larger water tank and nothing flashes at me!

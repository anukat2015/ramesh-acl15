Title: not for linux
Content:
If you try to install Ubuntu on it, you will be very disappointed like me: blank screen for duo boot, and "Grub error 22" for stand alone installation, most important, you won't be able to roll back to factory status if you did not burn a lifesaver CD using your own external CD-ROM before you want to change anything.

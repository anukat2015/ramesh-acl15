Title: Really Great for the Price!
Content:
I just installed expensive santos mahogany floors in my home and realized my upright Bissell would scratch the wood.  I started looking for specialzed hard wood vacs and couldn't believe there were vacs in the $1000 range!  This is the only specialized hard floor vac I could find in a reasonable price range (Sears actually sells it for almost $400 beware).  After reading some of the neg reviews I was prepared for "tipping over", "blowing hot air", etc.  I took a chance and so far I'm really happy with the results.  It is a light unit so you have to be on the gentler side when pulling it around otherwise, I could see how it would tip over, and it only blows in your face if your bending at an awkward angle.  So far so good!

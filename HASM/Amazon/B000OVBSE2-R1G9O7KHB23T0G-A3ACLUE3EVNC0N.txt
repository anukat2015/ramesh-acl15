Title: My kids love this!
Content:
My six and eight year olds love these Sansa Shakers.  They have proven themselves durable, as one has already been left out in the sprinkler overnight and still works fine.  They love to groove to their tunes and have everyone else hear them too.  They clip them to their belts and bikes.  They are a great deal and very kid friendly.  The only downside is the bottom always falls off when twisting the bottom to change songs.  It's attached by a string, but it's still annoying.

Title: showering is warm!
Content:
I purchased this heater because I was tired of freezing when I got out of the shower in the winter months.  We have a good sized bathroom and this heater does the job.  It puts out a strong flow of heat, but it feels so good.  We only use it in the bathroom so noise isn't a problem.  I still don't feel it is too loud.  We have had it for several weeks now and we love it.  Even if something goes wrong a year or two from now...the cost was inexpensive for a heater like this.

Title: Great Vacuum BUT watch out for the hose
Content:
This vacuum is great.  I have had it for just over two months.  I have white berber carpet and black labs so dog hair is very noticeable.  The machine itself works wonders and my carpet always apears hair and dirt free.  ***My only complaint is the flexible stretch hose***  The hose is semi-clear plastic with ribbing that holds a metal coil used used for support.  The metal coil is like a sliky, if it pops out of the ribbing in the plasic it folds on itself causing the hose to close up.  What a dissapointment because it really is a great vacuum but now I have to start all over again trying to find a new one  :(

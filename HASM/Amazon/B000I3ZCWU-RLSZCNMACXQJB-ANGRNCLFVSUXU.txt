Title: Definitely not a good point and shoot in doors
Content:
I have been waiting three years to buy this camera and all I can say is what a disappointment.  My first SLR was a Rebel 2000 so I am very familiar with all the normal features as well as the new features of this camera.  I also own a 5MP Canon A95 Power shot which blows the XTi out of the water on almost any indoor shot.  The flash is never enough - as one review said, almost all low light (in door) shots will come out dark.  The foreground will be OK but there will be no background detail.  Contrasting this with my Powershot, the same exact photo will have a nice bright background.  I have taken hundreds of comparison shots to a friend of mine's XTi as well as comparing to my Powershot.  The "new nine zone" focus does not work well either, I have to use center focus mode and be sure of what it is focusing on.  My Rebel 2000 film camera almost never a focus issue.  Unfortunately, it seems Canon just didn't put the quality into this one.  The only way I have found to get a better picture is to go into manual and push the flash up one stop, but for $800, I shouldn't have to do this.  The camera does take good outdoor shots and pictures of the moon etc. and the 1600 film speed is nice.

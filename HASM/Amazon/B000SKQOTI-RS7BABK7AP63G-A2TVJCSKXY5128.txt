Title: Simply Amazing
Content:
I purchased this camera for my wife for Christmas.  I'm not a professional photographer; but I am "obsessive compulsive" when it comes to investigating just about anything.  This camera generally gets rave reviews along with a few Nikon, Canon detractors (and we own a Canon Point and Shoot...a wonderful one).  Anyway, detractors aside, this is an awesome camera, every bit as good as advertised.  The pictures are simply amazing!  Pictures are very sharp, with excellent color and contrast.  The kit lens is more than decent.  The other "amazing" thing is that I had an old Vivitar with two lenses that actually fit this camera and they work perfectly!  My wife also bought a 70-300 Sigma telephoto lens through Amazon and it too works perfectly.  With built in IS and dust removal, this is one tough little digital SLR camera to beat.  Buy it!

Title: Junk or just one bad egg of the bunch? You Decide.
Content:
I was happy to read how many people like this heater. What worries me now is that some folks just do not care about workmanship or are not telling it like it is. This is not a quality product. The look and feel of it is like a cheap knockoff being sold at a second rate version of Sharper Image (RIP). It had scratches all over it, the shell was made of low grade plastic with a sharper image, ooooh styling. The fan was noisy upon powering up and the plastic cover on top was defective, so the plastic hinge broke off. I have seen better made toys from the PRC than this thing. I am wary of you folks who gave such a good review for a piece of plastic like this.

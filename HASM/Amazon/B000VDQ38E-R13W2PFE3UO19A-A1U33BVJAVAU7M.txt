Title: Awesome results!!  So glad we have this.
Content:
We received this vaccum as a wedding present.  We have a large pit bull mix and he sheds like crazy.  I thought this would help the pet hair situation but I had no idea how amazing it was until I tried it out.  After about 5 minutes of vaccuming the whole canister was full of dog hair (gross).  And, we vaccum on a regular basis, but with a "normal" vaccum that obviously was not cutting it.  It is very easy to empty and has tons of different attatchments for furniture and difficult to reach corners.  I can't imagine how dirty and hairy our house would be without it.  Best wedding present ever!  I highly recommend this product.

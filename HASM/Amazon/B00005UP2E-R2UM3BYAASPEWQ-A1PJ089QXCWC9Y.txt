Title: Good vaccum, good price
Content:
** Update **
I have owned this vaccum for a year now with absolutely no problems! I haven't changed the air filter, just clean it from time to time and it's still picking up dirt and dust like magic!
** End of Update ***
I actually found this vaccum at Big Lots for $70. Our home is very dirty, since we have an acre and a half of land, which is mostly a dirtbike track. With the windows open all day for summer and everyone riding in the backyard, kicking up dirt, the house gets dusty and dirty in a matter of a day and a half. The first day I used this, I was amazed as to how much dirt it cleaned up in just one room! It was almost half way full! This vaccum is very light weight, easy to put together, hides well in your closet and a great price. The filter isn't hard to clean either. Just tip it over and empty out the dirt and dust, and the dust bunnies that stick to the filter, just take it outside and blow it with the air compressor and viola! Clean filter. Overall a very reliable and easy to use vaccum.

Title: Too many bugs!
Content:
I have been using Ipods since they have come out and am very loyal to the brand. I purchased this nano for my husband, but we are very disappointed in it. First, it does not play in all Ipod-friendly devices. My car stereo has an Ipod connection and it plays my Ipod classic fine but will not recognize the nano. My husband had to search for a stereo for his car that would recognize it. Also, when he did find a stereo that recognized it, it doesn't charge it while playing it due to bugs with the nano so it dies on him frequently and he cannot listen to music for long. Also, when you shake the device, it skips to another song, which is fun, but not so fun when it is so sensitive it skips songs just from walking with it. If you are looking at buying an Ipod Nano, I encourage you to not get this generation and wait for a later generation and hope they have worked the bugs out, or buy an Ipod classic, which have always worked fine for me.

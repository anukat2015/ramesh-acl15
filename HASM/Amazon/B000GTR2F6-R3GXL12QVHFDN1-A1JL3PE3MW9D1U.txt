Title: Awesome cup of coffee!
Content:
Received this as a gift so we felt compelled to use it, but it's a great coffee maker. We bought the 'reusable' filter (available for about $15) and use our favorite brand of coffee and this cuts the cost down from about 50 cents per cup to 20 cents (using our local shop bean coffee). Only down side is that we drink a LOT of coffee and with the reusable filter you must clean it out after every use...and if you make a cup 'back-to-back' as we often do, the mesh filter is quite hot to the touch at first. Despite the negatives, I would still recommend this coffee maker.  There's nothing like a fresh brewed cup of coffee and this machines kicks it out in less than a minute.  Also great for hot chocolate, tea, etc.  Consider your beverage consumption patterns before choosing a size as there are several to select from. Ours makes a 4, 6 or 8 oz cup.  Enjoy!

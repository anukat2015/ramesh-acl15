Title: I just returned my iRiver--what a great feeling!
Content:
Do you remember how great it felt to break up with that lover where nothing in the relationship worked?  It was like a load was lifted from your shoulders and you could smile again.  That's how I feel about my ex-MP3 player, the iRiver H10.
I was very excited when I first took it home.  But after charging it I found that I couldn't navigate the screens for ten seconds without it crashing.  Oh, not to worry, there was a firmware update available.  Still, it bothered me that iRiver would sell something that useless.  What about the people who bought it before the update was available? Anyway, I updated to the latest firmware release, but it was still WAY TOO BUGGY to be usable.  
I would select a song, and it would decide to play another one instead.  On other occassions it wouldn't play at all until I rebooted.  Sometimes the scroll bar worked, but more often than not I would have to work it for a few seconds (or longer) to get it to respond.  
I finally got tired of constantly fighting it and returned it.  Ahhh...freedom.

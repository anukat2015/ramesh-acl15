Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
I have only had Ultrasilencer Green for a month but it has been great.  It is quiet as advertised, very light, moves well and does a great job on bare floors, which is all we have.  An Electrolux that my mother had is still going after more than 50 years.  If I could get half of that time I would be thrilled.
The price seemed reasonable.

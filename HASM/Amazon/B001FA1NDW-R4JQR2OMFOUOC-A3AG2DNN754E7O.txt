Title: IPOD Nano
Content:
Amazon.Com delivered all of the items I requested and on time to load pictures and music of my choice.  However, the unit did not state that you needed Itunes to load the music and any other functions on the IPOD.  If I had seen something to the affect i.e. "Install ITUNES on your laptop to get started".  This is a free service from Apple.  Also, the circular touchpad was not explained correctly.  I was beginning to think that my senses (touch/feel) on the pad would not work.  It wasn't until I discovered that just moving your thumb around the circular touchpad for each menu selected, that you would navigate to the next selection either going clock-wise or counter-clockwise.  
The IPOD Nano has very good graphics for .jpg's pictures and album pictures.  The sound is excellent and the volume is better than acceptable. I would recommend this product to anyone.

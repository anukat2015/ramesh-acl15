Title: Great vacuum
Content:
This is the vacuum I've needed forever. It is easy to pull around, light, and since it is a canister vac you can use it floor to ceiling with just a change of heads. Very powerful but not noisy, and has the Hepa filtration. On top of all that it is really nice looking in shiny silvery finish -- like a little rocket.

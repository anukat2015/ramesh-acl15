Title: Love The Rebel
Content:
Easy to use and very versitile. Combines the best of both worlds.(Digital and SLR) The manual is a little overwhelming at first, but once you start working your way through the menu you'll realize that it's not as difficult as it appears to be.
I've never had an auto pop-up flash, so it took a little getting used to. I love the fact that you can change the wide range of ISO settings. Light weight and durable.

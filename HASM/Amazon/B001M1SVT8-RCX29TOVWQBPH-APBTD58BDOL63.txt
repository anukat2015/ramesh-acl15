Title: Happy with my purchase
Content:
I looked long and hard before replacing my Canon Rebel XT. I knew I would stay with the Canon line because I had invested in several lenses, but there were at least three choices in my price range: the 40D, the 50D or the new replacement for the Rebel XT. I opted for the 50D and have been very pleased with it. I bought UDMA cards, and the camera is lightning fast now, especially compared to my old Rebel. I like the big screen on the back, and am having fun learning all the various functions and settings. Getting a couple of good books about the 50D helps. The camera came very quickly from Adorama and it does have the North American warranty (which is important).

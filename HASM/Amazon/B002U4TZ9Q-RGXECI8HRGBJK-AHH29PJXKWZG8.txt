Title: Can't Beat it for the Price
Content:
I bought this as a Christmas present to myself because it was a great price and I got some spending money for christmas. I had a Compaq computer before which had never let me down but lacked the proper processing powers (1.2 ghz and 512 RAM just didn't cut it). 
This computer was a steal for the price and so far it has been doing very well. I got it for "general use" yet this plays popular games like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars very well with low-moderate graphics settings. Youtube videos on 720p hd also play flawlessly but on 1080p hd the "cpu use" maxes out at 100% when the screen moves at a certain speed so the graphics card and 2.2ghz single core processor seem to max out there. 2gb RAM seems to be plenty so far and I haven't run into any problems. 
My friend bought a $700+ new dell laptop with touch sentitive features and the works. This computer opens folders and programs faster even though the processor is 1.4 ghz slower and the RAM is 2gb slower. Unless you want High-end Video or audio editors or videos in high 1080p or higher this is a great deal for the price. Overall it looks bland and the layout is two bulky buttons and a small touchpad yet looks can be deceiving. As stated the fan comes on for about 5-20 seconds at certain intervals depending on how long it's been on. This never bothers me though since the computer stays cool from it. It can be upgraded to 4gb of RAM which I might do if I ever need the processing power. Great Screen that looks like LCD at it's best. Windows 7 is a great touch as well. 
It's cheap, it's a bland silver, but you can't beat it for the price.

Title: Not so good
Content:
There were two things wrong with the Delonghi Portable AC that I recently bought and then returned:  1) A minor flaw with the right side exterior plastic panel that kept snapping out of place;  2) A major problem with the circulating fan that started making a loud noise after about 12 hours of operation.  The two problems were unrelated.

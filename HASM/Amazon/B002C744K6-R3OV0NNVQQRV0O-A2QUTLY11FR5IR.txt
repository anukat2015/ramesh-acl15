Title: Beautiful yet not flawless
Content:
I bought the 15.4" mac after having gone through 3 PC in less than 5 years.  Needless to say, I was fraustrated with each PC after a couple of years, it either dies on me or some apps fails to work properly because the forced upgrade that Windows kept pushing into the PC is not compatible with the apps.  After my last Sony VAIO desktop died on me first with the blu-ray disc drive, and then the apps began to fail, I turned to Mac hoping this kind of problem will no longer happen and the macbook pro will last me years to come.  I was debating between 15" and 17" because I like the bigger screen size (my Vaio desktop was 21") and the ease to carry around.  After visiting the apple store I decided 15" is the perfect size and with Amazon.com's competitive pricing and fast delivery, I got it in two days.  I'm impressed with the design of Macbook pro and how fast it is to start up and shut down.  The resolution is amazing, particularly with iphoto, you can see every detail of the picture.  I have yet to explore other apps other than itunes.  The advertised battary life was 7 hours, I haven't fully tested that yet, although I noticed that the battery generally start at about 5-6 hours after a full charge.  I would have given this product a five stars review if it wasn't for the mac freezes.  For example, I was importing a CD into itunes, but after importing only 2 songs, the whole screen suddenly froze and I could not force quit the app or move the cursor.  I had to hold the power botton for 8 sec to force the mac to shut down.  Fortunately, there was no issue when I re-started the mac.  However, for a product that is highly priced, this should not happen.

Title: Much-Improved Canon SLR
Content:
I have previously owned the Canon Rebel XT.  I liked this camera as an improvement over my previous Powershot.  The SLR offered the focusing and lens possibilities I had experienced with my film Elan camera.  However, I found the Canon XT did not do well in low-light situations and that it did not handle situations with varied lighting very well.
The new Canon XSi is a VAST improvement over the XT and well worth the investment.  Photos are much sharper.  The XSi easily adapts to all types of lighting situations.  Also its new larger LCD screen is much easier to use.  This camera feels more substantial in the hand, and I find all the buttons smartly placed for ease of use.
I might add that I have added the 55-250mm IS lens to the 18-55mm IS lens.  Both are light and easily used.  With 2 lenses I have both fairly wide angle and telephoto capabilities.  This is a great lens set up for anyone wanting to use their XSi in travel and hiking situations.

Title: Good when pilot remains lit
Content:
I purchased a unit in Spring 2003.  The unit was used throughout the summer in our tent trailer when the morning temperatures dipped below 40 degrees.  We used a 5 gallon propane tank connected via a 12 foot extension hose with little issue.  Unfortunately, the unit no longer works after being stored in the OEM's box for three months time.  As far as I can tell the pilot will no longer remain lit, which makes the unit useless to me.  I tried all the maintenance and troubleshooting tips and pursued alternative propane sources.  In summary, when the unit works, enjoy it!  My unit's useful life ended way too premature for a $80 investment.  I would NOT recommend for purchase.

Title: Beware of Apple iPods
Content:
I recently bought this MP3 player and was very disappointed.  I am returing it tomorrow for a refund.  I have a music library of over 3,000 songs on Windows Media Player. I was using a Creative Labs Zen MP3 player that I was/am very happy with. It's a snap to download songs on my Zen and aside from a rather short battery life, works great.  However, it is over five years old and I was looking to replace it with an iPod - big mistake!
After six hours of attempting to download my music library from my Media Player to the Apple format I found that many of my songs for some reason did not transfer to the iPod and many of the songs I was able to transfer/download to iPod somehow duplicated themselves. It was extreemly slow in downloading/transfering music files -- very frustrating.  All of my songs had to be changed over into the Apple "format" - this took several hours to accomplish as well.  After six hours and much frustration I gave up and decided to stick with my Creative Zen MP3 player (dated but reliable and easy to use) and my trusty Windows Media Player Library.  Stay away from Apple iPods!

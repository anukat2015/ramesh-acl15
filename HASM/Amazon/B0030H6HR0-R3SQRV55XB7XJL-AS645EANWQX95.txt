Title: Great supplemental heat
Content:
I bought an iHeater in October 2009. My house is over 75 years old and drafty. The iHeater cut my fall heating bills by 40%. During the worst winter we have had in years, my ancient furnace had to work much less than it otherwise would have, and even during the worst weather in January-February, my bills were lower than they were last year, a much milder winter. This heater provides steady, even heat. It can not start a fire. My cats actually sit on top of it at times. I recommend it highly.

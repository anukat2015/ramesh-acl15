Title: Another terrific Toshiba!
Content:
This is my 3rd laptop, 2nd Toshiba.  I got one of these on Black Friday for my son, and just ordered another for myself. I love Win 7! There is very little preloaded crap to remove and it is super fast. Having the numeric keypad on the side and an amazing screen add to its sheer awesomeness.  The touchpad is ultra cool.  I must agree with other reviewers that the sound is lacking, but I did not purchase the laptop to be my primary music player so I still gave it 5 stars. I was shocked when I first closed the laptop, being used to ones that latch. This one doesn't latch and the tension hinge (which keeps it closed in lieu of a latch) wants to slam shut in the last few inches, whereas those that latch have to be pushed all the way closed.  It survived that rough close and my 1st Toshiba, four months old and running great for my college student, survived a 3 foot drop onto carpet.  If a Toshiba can survive me, it has my loyalty.

Title: Field tested in Europe!
Content:
This Alpha  350K, did function very well, it was very handy and convenient to use the tilting screen,
the responses are just fine, and I got used to the slow response when using the tilting screen.
I was able to take shots over my head at times or over crowds! Also was able to take unusual angles!
Also noted that the battery "metering"indicator show the drain/remaining charge, that it uses more
battery with the tilting screen on.I carry an extra battery anyway. We took excellent images with this camera!

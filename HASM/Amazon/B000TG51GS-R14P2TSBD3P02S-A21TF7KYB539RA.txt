Title: Great for my Garage
Content:
I use this heater to control the heat in my garage during the winter. My kids' bedrooms are above the garage and have been difficult to keep warm. This has made a very noticeable difference and I like the timer function to maintain safety. I have not had a single problem or complaint. It has done exactly what I wanted. My kids also used it to dry their snow boots after playing outside. They just sat them about two feet in front of the heater and they dried very quickly. 
Despite the notorious nature of space heaters to use a lot of power, my electric bill has actually gone down once I started heating my garage with this heater. Excellent buy.

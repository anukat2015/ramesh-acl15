Title: lasted less than  1 1/2 years
Content:
Like so many others, my Keurig B70 started malfunctioning after 16 months. It started short-cupping me, so that I'd have to hit the brew button 3 times to make a cup of coffee. By the way, this started very shortly after one of my regular descaling procedures, so I don't think scale is the problem with my brewer, although the service people insist that it's a scale problem. Their thing to get you off the phone seems to be "You need to descale more often" and "You must use bottled water".
The company does not seem to stand behind their product, and the only thing they can do now is give me $30 off a new brewer, $130 instead of $170, which I think is laughable. Why would I want to get another brewer that may give up after only 1-2 years?

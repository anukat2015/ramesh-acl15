Title: Great computer !
Content:
This is my first HP laptop, my father has one and that's why I decided to go with them. 
First the computer looks awesome, well built and solid, its shiny and good looking. Some say that have problems with the colors of the keyboard, but if you know how to type using all your fingers and the correct way you will have no problems. 
The performance is good too, it has 4 GB of ram wich are more than enough to handle Vista. 
Yesterday I went ahead and did a clean instalation of the new Windows 7 RC, Microsoft really did a good work with that OS, super fast and stable, you should give it a try!! 
Overall I'm very happy with my purshase, when I first powered it on I had to reinstall the sound driver for a minor issue with the touch button for the mute, but everything else was ok! 
I highly recommend this computer !!!!!

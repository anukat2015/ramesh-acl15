Title: Great little device, but no fast forward
Content:
I was so excited to get this device for audio books.  I was very disappointed when I started a book and found that if I stopped mid-chapter, I could not get back to my place.  It's a big problem when the "chapter" is an hour long and I've listened to 40 minutes of it!  I either have to start over, skip the last 20 minutes, or let it run and set a timer to pick it up at the right spot.  Not very convienent.  Great sound, easy to load with music...would be fantastic if I only wanted to listen to music!

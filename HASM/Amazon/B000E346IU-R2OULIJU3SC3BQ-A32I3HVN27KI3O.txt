Title: Silent for sure
Content:
Its silent alright, you can plug it in and forget its even there. Tried to use in my living room left running overnight and came down stairs to a frigid room, couldn't even tell it was running unless you stand over it and feel a slight warm breeze. Its fine in a 8 x 9 room constantly running with the door shut but not in a room any larger.

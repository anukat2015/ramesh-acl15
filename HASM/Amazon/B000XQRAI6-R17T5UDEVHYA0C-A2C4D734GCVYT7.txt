Title: Plays well, but computer no longer recognizes it.. Buyer Beware!!!!!!
Content:
Initially, I loved this product. I would take it out snowboarding with me. I used it all last season, no problems. Great sound quality, portability, couldn't think of a bad thing to say about it. That was until a few weeks ago. I was going to transfer some new songs over for this new ski season to listen to on the hills. I connected it to the computer...... and nothing.
I have the same issue as many of the other people out there. My computer does not recognize the player anymore. I tried every solution on every website, including sansa, that deals with this issue and none of them worked. I tried updating the firmware, but when it says to attach the clip and click finish when the computer recognizes it, I can't because it does not work. I tried the hold and center button etc instructions, and same problem. Not recognized. I tried changing the mode on the player itself and then going through all the motions. And nothing. From reading many of the posts of there concerning this, I think it is just a problem with the player. It works for some and not for others. Looks like there's just a bad batch out there and some of us got it.
Either way, I can't complain too much. I got a very good deal for it on one of those holiday sales. And although I am now stuck listening to the same songs over and over again until it decides to bite the dust, it still works great except for the lack of computer recognition issues.

Title: Great pruduct
Content:
I bought this product before I read these reviews so naturally I was a bit worried about my decission. However now that I have had it for a month I feel confident with my purchase. As a single person living alone this product meets all my needs. I get just the right amount of coffee, it stay's hot, and I don't have to worry about replacing another carafe. I would recommend this product to anyone.

Title: Great suction but minor design flaw
Content:
Metropolitan Professionals ADM-4PNHSF 13 Amp 4 Horsepower Canister Vacuum with Quadruple Hepa Filtration and Electric Power Nozzle
This little vac has terrific suction, better than any cannister I know of. Unfortunately, there are 2 minor design problems. First, there is no catch or hook that keeps the hose attached to the body. I must have pulled it out 10 times doing one small house. All it needs is a simple twist catch or such. Second,there is no comfortable place for your hand holding the thing. The hose attaches to the smooth part that the attachments go in, but that is right where you need to hold it, so you are holding the hose which isnt comfortable. Don't manufacturers EVER use their own products?? These things should not have been missed from a company that's been around forever. It sure did a good job vacuuming though - hope they fix these things.

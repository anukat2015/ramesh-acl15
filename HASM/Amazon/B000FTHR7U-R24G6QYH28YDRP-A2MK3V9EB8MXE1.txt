Title: Amazing camera, stunning price
Content:
I've owned this camera for about 6 months now.  I did an exhaustive search prior to buying it and I'm as happy as can be with my purchase.  Digital SLR with fabulous images.  Previously I owned a nice Nikon Coolpix (convenient) and a Nikon standard 35mm SLR (better picture quality).  
The camera is easy to use.  The settings on it are pretty straight forward.  The instruction manual helps with some fine points and details, but it's not hard to learn.  The batteries last a long time and are bought rather inexpensively over the net.  I've not really used the software that came with it since my computer transfers images already so I can't really comment on that.  
The quality of the pictures is really very impressive - even when enlarged.  I photographed a friend's wedding recently and my pictures vs the "real" photographer's were hard to tell apart (except he usually had a better angle!).  
Even if this camera were the same price as it's competition I think it would win.  But it's less expensive and a real steal.

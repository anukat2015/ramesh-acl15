Title: Very happy Miele owner
Content:
I used a cheap, poor-performing upright vacuum for years, but finally got sick of seeing the dirt and dog hair that it failed to pick up.  When I started looking for a high-quality vacuum, I started off my research by checking out the top-rated vacuums on Amazon, and immediately saw the Miele vacuums at the top of the list.  I had never heard of them.  After reading the reviews and discussing the options with my wife, we decided to purchase the S4212 Neptune, and we LOVE this little machine.  It is light, powerful, and does what it is supposed to do - it sucks up dirt, dust and dog hair off of my floors with very little effort. The only complaint I have concerns the vacuum bags - they are small, and a bit on the expensive side (the four-pack of genuine Miele bags is about $20.00 from my local store).  The Miele is so good at getting up dirt and pet hair that I am replacing bags more frequently than I ever have in the past.  Overall though, the bag issue is not significant enough to alter our opinion that this vacuum deserves a solid five-star rating, and we are VERY happy with our purchase.

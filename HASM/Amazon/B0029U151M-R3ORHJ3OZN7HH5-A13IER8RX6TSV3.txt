Title: Beautiful style, long battery life
Content:
I purchased this laptop to use it a portable unit, in addition to a workstation I already have. My overall impression is that it is a great laptop at an affordable price.  I just installed Ubuntu 9.10; there are some driver issues, but all key functions are working out of the box.
Pros:
Thin and light, although not the lightest
Good screen size 14 inches > 13.3 for most portable laptops
Long battery life.  6 hours on full brightness
Beautiful, smooth keyboard --- feels great to type
Minimalistic overall design with great beauty -- it looks better than photos, and I was pleasantly surprised when received the item.
Cons:  Overall, only minor complains
Fans a bit loud when on full; sometimes they are on for minutes continuously
Keys attract fingerprints
Optical drive not modular -- not able to remove it to save weight (without taking out screws).
(Note: Some driver issues with Ubuntu 9.10)
If you need a portable unit for basic working, I would recommend this product.

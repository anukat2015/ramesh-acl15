Title: Great Heater - Low Energy Usage
Content:
I bought this heater two years ago and found it to be very energy efficient.  While it's a little bit louder than I'd like, it manages to heat a 13x13 room comfortably.  I especially like the various mode options, including the timer mode and the temperature set option. It oscillates, heating the entire space not just the space in front of the heater. The auto shut off if it tips in the least is also a great feature. And, it stays cool to the touch. I am actually buying another one today so I don't need to move my current one from room to room.  I tried another model space heater and when I turned it on, all the lights in the room dimmed - that went back to BJs the same day!

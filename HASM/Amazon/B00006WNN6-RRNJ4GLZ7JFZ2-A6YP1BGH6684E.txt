Title: Does the job well
Content:
I bought this over a month ago and am very satisfied. It is primarily used as a foot warmer while sitting on the couch or under the computer desk. The thermostat has two level setting and the fan has 6 speeds. The heat is noticeable only when the controls are set to max. It is being used atleast for a few hours daily and has worked consistently.

Title: What you see is what you get
Content:
I order this item from Amazon because the delivery was much faster ( next day ) than the faster deliver from Apple.
The only problem I had is when I went to an Apple store to upgrade the memory.
If you buy the item from an Apple store you get the 2GB upgrade for 150 dollars ( if you do it during the 45 days of your purchase ). That means, you will get 4GB for 150 dollars. Apple will replace the 2GB that comes with the MacBook with 4GB.
When I approach the Apple store they ask me for the Apple store Invoice so they can refund me 150 dollars, the price for 4GB is 300 dollars. I told them I bought it from Amazon. They refuse to refund the 150 because they can not "insert" the 2GB back to the system.
After a long discussion they finally agree ( it took more than an hour and several managers ).
So, be aware.  Something that is true if you by from an Apple store wont be true if you buy from Amazon.

Title: Great laptop for everyday use - battery could be longer lasting
Content:
Overall, I'm very happy with this laptop.  Works great, is fast, clear picture, and love the Windows 7 vs. my old Vista.   Only gripe is the battery lasts under 2 hours with normal use - not the 3.75 hours listed.   We keep ours plugged in mostly, and use on the go as necessary.   Would buy similar one again, just upgrade the battery.

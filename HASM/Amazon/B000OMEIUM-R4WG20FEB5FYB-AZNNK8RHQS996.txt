Title: Save your money!
Content:
I own this model and wish I had purchased a MacBook instead. My unit was shipped with Vista (which crashes all the time) I contacted Toshiba about a disk to "upgrade" it back down to XP and was shocked to learn that they can't help me as they didn't make the software so I should contact Microsoft (who told me to call Toshiba) with Vista problems. Nice! So unless you like LOTS OF PROBLEMS with NO SUPPORT don't waste your hard earned money on anything running Vista.  After so many lock ups and a few total restores, I gave up and purchased an IMac. WOW! I wish I had done this years ago. I'll be happy to purchase another Toshiba when they ship it with the Mac OS.

Title: look for better product
Content:
I was looking for a vacuum that can do all the job. I was so tired of doing the same old type of cleaning at my apt's hardwood floor, since nobody cleans except me I was expecting that this would lessens the job. But I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE of buying this product. At first, It was ok. A little bit hard to push forward when you are using the wet vacuum side and the floor is not that wet. And it has the worst vacuum suctioning that I've ever seen.You need to use another vacuum that would do a good suction on the dirts on the floor.And when your doing the suction for the wet vacuum the water leaks on the sides. So It's really a waste of time and money when you buy this product. I sent it back for my refund. I should have trusted the comments before I decided to buy this product. It's really not worth it.

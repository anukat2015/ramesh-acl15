Title: Great little mp3
Content:
I bought the Zen mainly for audio books.  My Colby did not have bookmark feature and I was constantly looking for where I left off.  The Zen is so much easier to use.  I tried the Creative Software they offered and didn't like it, so I use Windows Media Player.  This works great and allows me to put books on Zen and music on Colby.  The battery life is amazing.
I was told up front my Zen did not offer FM or an external speaker.  These
were not the features I needed so no problem.  The sound quality is great.
I use a name tag holder like you get at conventions, hook it to my shirt and off I go.  It is so small that this is the perfect way to carry it.

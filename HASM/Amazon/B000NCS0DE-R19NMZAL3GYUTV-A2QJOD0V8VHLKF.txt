Title: Pet Hair Removal
Content:
My husband bought me the Dirt Devil PURPOSE for pets.  We have white furniture, with 2 black cats, and 1 grey cat.  The product lost it's "awesomeness" after a few uses.  I went to Walmart to return it, and look for the next best thing.  This was it.  GREAT price.  I LOVE that it's handheld/compact.  I LOVE how long the cord is.  The rubber electrostatic bristles are AWESOME at scraping up the cat hair that I can't get up with manual hair brushes.  The only thing that concerns me is the pivit feature.  The attachment just dangles there like a limp hand.  I can't seem to figure out why.  I think it would be much better if the attachment was stiff so I could get into the nitty gritty in the couch.  Also, it leaves a weird pattern on my couch, not nothing that can't be fixed with a once over with the hand.  A small price to pay for a handheld that gets the cat hair off my couch.

Title: Junk!
Content:
My husband got this for me for Christmas as I am always complaining I am cold.  Unfortunately as soon as he took it out of the box and turned it on for about 2 minutes he decided it worked and threw out the box.  I have had it on all day and it has not kept me warm at all.  Not even in a very small room.  No matter what setting I put it on, it throws the same amount of heat out, and the knobs turn very easily, so not sure the child feature is working.  I can put it on setting I, II, or III and they are all the same. Also the outside of the unit is staying ice cold, which I assume is not normal since the instructions are telling you in bold to not touch it as it gets hot. I am not happy that we cannot return it.  I have contacted Honeywell/Kaz but no reply yet.  BUT even when they do reply, I am not about to spend more money on shipping to send it to them, plus a $10 check to have them send it back either.  TOTAL and complete waste of money.  I would give no stars if I could.

Title: C.D. player?!?!? It's more than that!
Content:
Just put the installation c.d. in your computer and then follow all the directions! That's practicly all you have to do to get songs on your iPod. I got mine for Christmas '04 and i have about a day and a half of music on mine! Just picture this... my brother had 33 hours of music on his computer and it was only 1.9 gbs! You have either like 4 gbs, 20gbs, or 40gbs! I have the 40gb one but it doesnt come in all the awsome colors(pink! o well! lyl seeyalaterz yallzers!

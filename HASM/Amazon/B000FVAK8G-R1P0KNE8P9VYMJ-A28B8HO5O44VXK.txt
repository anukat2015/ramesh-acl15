Title: A complete lemon.
Content:
I don't know what's going on with this heater. I bought this model last October from Amazon. It had recently come on the market. It worked fine for three months and then started slowly dying. It would shut off after fifteen minutes, then it became ten minutes, and finally after five months or so, it wouldn't stay on for more than a minute. When I went back on Amazon, I saw several other people complaining about the same defect. I called Kaz, the company that makes these Honeywell heaters, and they tried to tell me that the problem was with another version of this heater, and that my model was working fine. Now I find this heater listed on Amazon without any of the negative consumer reviews that it had earlier. Are we to believe this is a newer (supposedly problem-free) version of the old lemon? If so, the company should clearly state so somewhere and recall the old model with full money-back to buyers.

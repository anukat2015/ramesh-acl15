Title: Gateway laptop extremely light, nice features, but will it hold up?
Content:
I was surprised at the light weight of the laptop, even battery installed.  It's suppose to run 8 hours on a charged battery, nice.  One nice feature is a button on top of the keyboard next to the DVD to open and close it.  I wish you could get a warranty longer than one year on the laptop and order it with Windows 7 professional, instead of the home edition only.  The mirrored touchpad buttons look good but get covered with finger prints pretty quickly.  I also worry that, because of it's light weight, the system may not hold up well to traveling.  I guess time will tell.

Wow, I'm so excited about my new nano. The design is brillant, color great and it has so many functions. I've came from a 1st gen nano, so im really happy I can watch my podcast's on this. Great battery life, around 12 hrs. and you can play games and have other little functions like stopwatch, watch, and calender. And with 2,000 song capacity(8GB) I don't think I'll you'll need a new one for a long time.

Title: Bang for the Buck
Content:
I already had a 4gb ipod that stores hundreds of albums and it's great but since getting the shuffle I find that I use it more than the other. Its light weight is really nice, you can put it in your shirt pocket, use the lanyard, or strap it to your arm. It may be small but you can still download a days' worth of listening. 
In January when I bought it, the shuffle costs 95 bucks and now you can have it for less than 70, with free delivery from Amazon. Buy a cheap Y-adapter audio cable from Radio Shack or similar and you can hook it up to your home stereo and play it through its speakers. A lot of bang for the buck here, getting a portable player than can also double as a stereo component.  
One note. I did have a problem with the original unit's failure to hold a charge but returning it and getting a replacement was very easy and fast through Apple. Sometimes seeing how a company deals with a problem is the best test of all.

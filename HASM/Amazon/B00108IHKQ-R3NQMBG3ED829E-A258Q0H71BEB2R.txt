Title: Great Laptop
Content:
This is the third laptop I've owned and it is by far the best. When I originally started researching laptops I was reluctant to look at Sony because they always seemed overpriced. After reading reviews, like this one, I decided what the heck you get what you pay for and let me tell you this machine is awesome. Unlike the Dell, and HP machines I owned before this one is light, fast, and very portable at just over 5 lbs with a 14.1" screen. Let me say the only reason that I didn't give this VAIO a 5 star rating is because like many others I HATE all the pre-loaded software that come on a new computer and this one seemed to have more than most. Once I uninstalled all of that stuff and tidied up the hard drive this thing zooms. One other small drawback is that the standard battery doesn't last much more than two to three hours. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this laptop.

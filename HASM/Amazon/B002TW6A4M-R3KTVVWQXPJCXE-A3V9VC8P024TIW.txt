Title: Titan does it all
Content:
Switching on the Titan is like starting up a BMW. Refined, hushed, intelligent. What a great vacuum. I owned an Electrolux canister for many years and it was excellent, but this is a step up. The canister is lightweight and easy to move around. The suction is strong and can be adjusted. The exhaust comes out the top, which makes sense - why would you blow exhaust out the side or back when you're wanting to suck up dust? They've done it right. The knob to select the setting of suction is easy to use, the handle is comfortable and at the perfect angle - it's a pleasure to use. In fact, I've vacuumed everyday since I got it, it's so much fun to pick up dust that's been lying around for a long time.

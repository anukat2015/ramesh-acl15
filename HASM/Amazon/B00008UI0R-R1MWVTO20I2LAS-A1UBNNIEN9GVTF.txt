Title: Reasonably good vacuum at a great price
Content:
We bought this because it is the closest match we found to our previous vacuum which is no longer manufactured.  In some ways it is better than my previous one, in some ways less good.  Here is my review:
WAND--Adjusts to various lengths!  At last, a wand that is the right length for me!
HANDLE--Has molded area on underside that chafes skin, and my hand slides off the end of it.
HARD FLOOR TOOL--Much better than it looks at first sight.  It gets around and under almost anything.
CARPET FLOOR TOOL--Very powerful.  Excellent for pile rugs/carpet.  Will eat small and/or soft rugs even on low suction.  Very large and heavy.  The mechanism that holds the wand upright in this tool does not hold well--the slightest touch causes it to release.
HAND POWER TOOL--Fun!  Handy for quick-cleaning rugs/carpet under furniture.
VARIABLE SUCTION--Very useful for different surfaces. 
CANISTER--Small and maneuverable.  Built-in tool caddy holds only 2 smallest tools (plus dust filter brush).
CONTROL BUTTONS--On Button is not labeled "on"!  It is also the Suction Control button--and is marked as such, and there is a separate Off button.  The Floor/Carpet control button is between the other two.  Just plain stupid design.  I am constantly pressing the wrong buttons.
DIRT CUP--Easy to empty. Tiny.
DUST FILTER--Papery material and has to be gently washed and air-dried.  Impractical.  I'll probably end up buying a second one to use while the other dries.
CREVICE TOOL--Half-length and half-useful.
DUSTING TOOL--It is not!  It is a small hard surface tool with short rigid bristles, not a dusting tool with soft bristles.  There is no dusting tool.
FOOT OPERATED RELEASE CATCHES--There are two and neither is sturdy enough to stand up to average use by average people. 
Overall, a good vacuum.  I don't expect to ever find a "perfect" vacuum.

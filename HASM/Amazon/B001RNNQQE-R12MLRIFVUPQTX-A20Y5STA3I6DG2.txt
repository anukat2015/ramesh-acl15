Title: Satisified,not thrilled
Content:
The coffee pot looks great on the counter, good styling,  doesn't take up a lot of space. The coffee is hot right out of the pot, no need to preheat the pot if you don't have time. However, I am having more difficulty than I ever have with any other pot in learning to adjust the amt. of coffee grounds used, to get the strength I like. The one thing I really don't like is that you have to almost turn the pot up-side down to pour coffee out, especially the last couple of cups.

Title: Reliable and light-weight.
Content:
Really researched this purchase. So many hand vacs are now too heavy. I only use mine for small tasks, crumbs, ashes, dog hair and such---for quick clean up. Very good suction and stays charged for a long time. Others are probably very good with brushes and all, for a more thorough cleaning. I wanted small and light weight, this fits the bill.

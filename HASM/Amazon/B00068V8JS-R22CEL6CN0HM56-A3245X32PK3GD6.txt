Title: Unhappy with heater I purchased
Content:
I purchased 3 of these heaters, one for each bedroom.  I was very unhappy with them and returned all for a refund.  There were two problems.  First, very little heating capacity.  The $20 space heaters from Wal-Mart I bought produced much more heat.  Secondly, I had purchased these heaters because of the wall-mount feature.  I thought that would be cool to have them out of the way.  The problem was that the back got extremely hot (couldn't even touch surface without discomfort).  I called the company and they said that it was safe, not a fire hazard.  However, upon calling two people (one handyman, one person in heating department at Lowe's), they did say it was a fire hazard, that the drywall and wood couldn't get that hot behind it.  I was extremely uncomfortable mounting it to the wall because I was afraid I would burn the house down!  It just did not appear to be as safe as the company was saying it was.  So I returned all three and got a refund on all of them.

Title: Zen Player by Creative meets expectations
Content:
Creative makes a good, solid product, and the Zen Vision M player continues this tradition of quality.  The Zen is available in 30 or 60 GB.  I chose the 30 GB size feeling it would more than meet my needs at a more affordable price. I have not come close to utilizing all that memory.  My  songs are organized in user-created playlists such as easy listening, workout, movie themes etc.  The player's navigational touch pad is hyper- sensitive, making any menu browsing slightly challenging.  The Zen can easily be connected to the stereo through AV cables (sold separately).  The Zen also has an FM radio that auto selects and programs available stations.  It was not, however, able to select my favorite station (weak signal), and gives no manual controls for me to select it myself. Includes video features, and easily interfaces with subscription sites such as Napster. Comes is a variety of cool colors. Excellent battery life.  I really enjoy my Zen Vision M.

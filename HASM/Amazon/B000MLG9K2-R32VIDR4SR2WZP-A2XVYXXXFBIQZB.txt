Title: Major Battery Problems When Used With Nikon 18-200mm VR Lenses
Content:
Many D-80 users, myself included, have problems where the battery dies for no reason when using the 18-200mmVR lens. Evidently it may be a contact issue/voltage related with this combination camera and lens. Nikon has not offered a solution yet and replacement of the body and/or lens does not help. Hence the 3 star rating BUT this camera is fantastic and so is the lens. Hope Nikon solves this soon.

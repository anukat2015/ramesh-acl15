Title: The perfect blend between price, performance, and features!
Content:
There are plenty of great reviews of this camera. I will try to quickly note the pros and cons below.
Pros:
- Value/Price: At the current price of $1699, this camera is a steal! It delivers near pro quality at a consumer price tag.
- Resolution: 10 MP is a lot of data. Enlargments at 20"x30" look superb from this camera, and even prints up to 40"x60" look pretty good. This delivers enough resolution for 95% or more of the potential buyers.
- Performance: 5 frames per second make this camera pretty fast. Add in the fact that color rendition is near perfect, and auto focus and metering are spot on. This camera performs similar to a pro SLR.
- Customer service: Nikon lenses come with a 5 year warranty, Canon lenses come with a 1 year warranty. Canon currently is experiencing serious quality control problems, even with their "L" glass (Think I'm kidding? Search the web for Canon lens quality control and see what you find). Nikon rarely has problems, but when they do they are very helpful. Instead "fixing" the problem at their repair facilities, they send you a new product, in most cases.
- User control/features: The D200 features a very large and bright LCD, and an intuitive menu. Every commonly used control has a button shortcut somewhere on the camera. The bright and detailed histograms won't dissapoint! The layout on this camera is simply perfect.
- Build: Very tough and durable, weather sealed as well. Feels like it will last forever.
Cons:
- Noise: Because of the chip design (different than the CMOS chips Canon uses) digital noise is a factor at high ISO's and long exposures. NIK Dfine is a photoshop software plug-in (one of many) that reduces noise without losing much or any sharpness/detail. Therefore, noise isn't a huge issue.
- Availability: As of now 6/22/06, there are not many of these in stock anywhere. Accesories are even harder to find, and the prices for many of D200 add-ons has jumped. Once supply cathces up with demand, this shouldn't be a problem.
- Wide angle: With a 1.5x crop, this camera doesn't work as well for wide angle photography. Nikon does offer a great 10.5mm fisheye and a 12-24mm lens, but those who already have a wide angle from before are going to be out of luck. Not a huge issue for some, and it makes up for it a bit by catering to the telephoto crowd.
In my opinion, the good outweighs the bad, by a landslide. I used to have a Canon 5D, but switched over to Nikon and bought this camera. The D200 offers a professionla build, with near pro performance, coupled with easy to use controls, and a lower price than comparable digital SLR's. This makes the D200 a clear winner in my book, not the best at anything in particular, but it does whatever you ask of it, and does it very well. This model truly bridges the gap between pro and consumer cameras.

Title: I am quite impressed, it works better than I had expected
Content:
We purchased this heater to try and decrease our gas / electric bill which has been high from running our central heating so much.  We spend most of our time in our living room so I purchased it to keep that area a little warmer.  I was amazed how much heat this unit put out.  This is our first night using it so I decided to give it a test.  I turned our heat off about 4 hours ago and turned this unit on.  I was curious to see if this unit could heat our downstairs.  It is only 15 degrees outside right now and it has not only maintained the temperature but also increased it by about 6 degrees quite rapidly.  This unit consumes 900 watts on low power and 1500 watts on high power.  I will leave an update if I have any problem with this unit but so far it's great.

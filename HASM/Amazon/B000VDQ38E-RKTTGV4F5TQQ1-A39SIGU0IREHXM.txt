Title: A lot of work to keep it clean
Content:
This vacuum does pick up pet hair on carpets well, but be prepared to clean the entire unit VERY frequently.  The dust bin must be emptied after every use, and it is gross.  I would never buy a vacuum where I have to clean the dust bin (as opposed to throwing away a paper bag) ever again.  You MUST have another vacuum that you can use to clean this one because it gets so dirty!  This also is useless on floors and next to impossible to use on stairs.  It is supposed to come apart and turn into a canister, but I've yet to figure out how to do that.  The attachments also do not work very well.  (A sponge I bought in a pet store works much better at getting cat hair off of the furniture.)
Overall, I would not buy this again, and I do NOT recommend it.

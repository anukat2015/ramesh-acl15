Title: pretty good!
Content:
I was used to take photos with a FM3 (Nikon - film). I realy like a film machine, but I also falled in love with this digital camera (Nikon D80). I like to take pictures in a manual mode and this camera allows me to do that! And, of course, if you want it does everything in automatic mode! Furthermore, it's pretty good in vibration reduction, specialy in a slow speeds! The unique negative point is the battery, however you can take almost 250 pictures before charge it!

Title: Great but has a few flaws
Content:
Let me start off with, I love the lattes and coffee from this machine.What I do not enjoy are the carafes, the water fills for both the coffee and the espresso maker, and the coffee filter basket.  Let's start with;The carafesIf you pour either the coffee pot or the espresso pot too fast you will end up with coffee all over the counter or floor.  You need to pour it s-l-o-w.  (If you're like me, that first cup of coffee can't come soon enough so a little restraint is in order!)The water fillsBoth water fills are accessed from the top.  If you have the unit placed on the counter and there is a cabinet above, you need to move the unit out from under the counter in order to fill it with water.  Not a big deal but it is a bit of a pain to move the whole unit out, fill it, then push it back.The coffee filter holderThe holder is easily swung out for ease of adding a filter and the coffee.  The difficulty comes when, and if, you want to take the holder out and give it a rinse or to clean it.  It is a real challenge to get it back in.  Once you get the hang of it, it becomes a little easier but still it's a struggle.Overall the unit looks nice.  I enjoy the feature that allows me to take the carafe and pour a cup of coffee while the unit is still in process of making the coffee.  It has made 100+ lattes by now and they taste as good, if not better, than the $4.00 ones at the local coffee chain.  The coffee comes out plenty hot and tastes great.  While this one was given to me as a gift I wouldn't hesitate to buy one, even with the few minor inconveniences.  Enjoy your coffee and lattes!

Title: Upgraded from a D100 to this solid performer, Nikon D80!
Content:
I just upgraded from a Nikon D100 and will say that this Nikon D80 is a solid performer. I'm a novice but not a professional yet. I have taken some visually stunning pictures with the D80 that not even the D100 could produce without using photoshop. The details that now can be seen is nothing more than the art of technology. Never again will I fall to far behind the power curve. If you're looking for an upgrade and dont want to spend alot of money but need to be competative, the Nikon D80 will not let you down.

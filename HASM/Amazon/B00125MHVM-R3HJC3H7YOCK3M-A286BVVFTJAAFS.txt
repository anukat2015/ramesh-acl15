Title: Very good price, lower quality
Content:
I have always used Canon before but I have also used a Nikon D-60 for a short while.
I obtained an A200W (two lenses kit). I generally liked the build, excellent features for the price and the fact that it includes two lenses (18-70 and 75-300). The menus are excellent and the battery life is extremely good.
However there are disappointing things also:
- ISO800 and above is almost unusable for professional work because of the noise.
- In low light situations (indoor and cloudy days) the noise and quality of the photo (white balance and in noise) is sometimes terrible.
- Pictures of kit lens 17-70 are disappointing in maximum zoom. Same goes with 75-300. 
- Photos with flash (automatic mode) are sometimes overexposure and sometimes underexposure.

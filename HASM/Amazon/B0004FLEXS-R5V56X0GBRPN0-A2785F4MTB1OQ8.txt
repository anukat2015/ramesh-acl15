Title: DCM2500B SmartBrew Coffeemaker
Content:
Bought this because of the top rating in Consumer Reports.Making and pouring coffee was great.  However I sent the first one back because the clock would go berzerk after a day or two and therefore the auto brew would not come on when it should. We woke up to cold coffee that was made in the middle of the night. When the clock changed you couldn't reset it because it would go from 1:00 to 19:00 (rather that 1:00 to 12:00 AM/PM as when first plugged in), almost like a timer. We had to unplug the coffeemaker for 30 seconds to get the clock to reset only to have the same thing happen in a day or two. Sent it back for a replacement and the new one did the same thing. Maybe our kitchen TV or Laptop was causing interference because they were close to it. Either way it didn't work for us. We sent the second one back for a refund and bought another Braun, just like the one we were replacing in the first place.

Title: Worst coffee maker I ever owned
Content:
The coffemaker shuts off before it stops brewing; when you take the lid off to pour the coffee the coffee splashes all over the counter top and when you are ready to drink the coffee it is luke warm.  There apparently are two coffeemakers so watch it..one shuts off immediately and the other shuts off 2 hours later.

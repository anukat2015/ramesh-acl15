Title: Great Product - Terrible supplier with appauling customer 'service'
Content:
We ordered two of these for Thanksgiving. One arrived dented and then is took them three weeks and more than 20 phone calls and four attempts to get them to collect and replace it. (They did not tell Fedex they needed two shipping slips for the two boxes it comes in - we got to know our Fedex man pretty well though)   When the second one finally arrived the day before we left for xmas vacation, it would not ignite. And as we were not able to return home to open it and discover this for another two weeks, we were not able to make their 1 week deadline to report a faulty product. The one that works, is great. The company is completely unfocussed on its customers and has serious issues with accountability.
Please don't bother to deal with them.

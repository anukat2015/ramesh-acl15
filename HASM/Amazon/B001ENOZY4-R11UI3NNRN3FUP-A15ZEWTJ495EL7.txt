Title: Very Very Pleased
Content:
I don't get very excited so much about stuff as I do about people. I bought this camera shortly after my grand daughter was born. I wanted a camera that would give me really good pictures of my family and what ever else.The pictures are so amazingly sharp, with great depth and color. I am so happy that we have captured amazingly life like moments with the D90. Well worth the investment.Looking forward to a life time of really great quality pictures.

Title: Absolutely love it
Content:
I have just gotten this laptop. I got mine on sale at the microsoft store online for a great price. Mine was $635 and its new, it has Windows 7, 4gb memory, 500gb hard drive and came with the 9 cell battery. Many colors to chose from. Also from getting it from Microsoft, they got rid of all the unneccesary programs that were installed on it from Dell. 
Very easy easy to set up, because just about everything was done for me. I just had to turn it on, enter my name and info and then go to the Dell website and transfer the warranty, very easy.
This is my second Dell Laptop, my first one was terrific, so I thought about getting another Inspirion, but I wanted something a little different so I decided on the Studio 1555 and I am so glad I did.
Very easy to use, I love the long battery life. I really like the cd player, so much better than having a tray come out. I love the mouse pad and the wider or longer keyboard on the Studio vs. the Inspirion I had
I read some bad reviews, but I figured I would give the laptop a try, it is under warranty so if I have any problems I know Dell will fix it up for me.
Cons: none yet

Title: Wonderful camera, super customer service

After using this for over 2 months, I absolutely have no regret.  As a matter of fact, I'm extremely glad I did not get the Nikon D90.  I probably would consider the Nikon D300 for better Auto Focus performance, but that costs quite a bit more.  This thing is a joy to use and the image quality is amazing, I actually found this easier to use than my 2 other Canon PS (shooting manual, that is).

After checking out the camera, I found that there's a lint on the focus plate that would not go away, it does not affect the picture but annoy the hell out of me.  I emailed Amazon's customer service and got a response the same day, I was offered 3 very good options and I picked the replacement option.  One day after I picked the replacement option (I could get full refund, a good discount or replacement), a new replacement was delivered.  I am thrilled.   As for the camera, there's not much I can say other than that it exceeds all my expectations.  It is a bit heavy but it takes amazing pictures.   It was between the Nikon D90 and the Canon 50D for me, since I plan to use the camera on a trail taking pictures of wild life and birds, I think the Canon 50D will serve me better.  Most people think Nikon has a better UI, but it took me around 2 hours to learn most of the features and operation of the camera even though I never used a Canon DSLR before so I don't think the UI on the Canon is unfriendly as some people claim.  I have no interest in holy war between the camera camps, I think both Canon and Nikon make good cameras and I just happen to think this camera is better for me.

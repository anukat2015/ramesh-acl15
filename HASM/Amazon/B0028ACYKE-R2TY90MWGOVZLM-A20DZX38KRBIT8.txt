Title: Not impressive.
Content:
This is very over priced.  For MSI to rake in 700 dollars for this 15 year old spec laptop is crazy.  Sure it runs Vista but so does Eee PC 1000H.  The idea of charging this premium for such a dated spec laptop is laughable.  I can buy a full size fully functional, top spec laptop or pc for this price by pretty much any brand, and pay an extra 200 dollars to get a top quality macbook.  This thing is very cheap looking, feels cheap, seems very flimsey and doesen't hold it's own very well with performance.  These netbooks are a rip off if priced over 350$ because thats all their worth....hell you can still buy a modern laptop better than this MSI for 300$.

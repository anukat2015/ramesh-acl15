Title: Weak Coffee
Content:
All the complaints are true, although I wouldn't exaggerate that badly!
The carafe is great at keeping the brew warm, but lousy at letting it pour out. Built in grinder sounds like a 747 taking off at full throttle. End of brew cycle it burbles and gurgles like a geyser about to explode.
Bottom line even with a gold-tone filter or paper filter and using the french roast, varying the grind(w/external grinder), the coffee is way too weak tasting for me.
Don't bother with it....I'm going with a manual siphon brewer.

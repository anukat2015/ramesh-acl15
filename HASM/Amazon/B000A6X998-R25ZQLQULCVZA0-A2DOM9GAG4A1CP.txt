Title: The best quartz heater I've ever bought
Content:
I've owned quite a few Quartz heaters and most were junk.  This one is different.  
The six year warranty was the first big clue.  Several things hit me immediately; both elements heat up in both high and low modes for very even heating.  (Every heater I've ever seen leaves one element going full-blast and shuts the second off when in LOW mode, but not this one.)  Second, the fan draws cool air in from the top and blows it back out through vents behind the quartz elements, pushing hot air out directly in front of the unit, not out the top or bottom.  
The fan is very quiet, and the sound is consistent whenever the heater is being used.  The elements are VERY well designed: they are short and nearly 3/4" in diameter, and will probably last forever because of this.  The front grate and "tip rail" at the top are made from heavy sheet metal, as is the reflector behind the elements.  
Finally, the electronic one-touch thermostat is awesome.  Hit the button once, it's on in HIGH.  Twice, it's running in LOW.  No fooling around with dials and switches - nice!  Keep pressing and you get several thermostat settings in either HIGH or LOW.  (IE: 65, 70, 75 degrees.)  Very nice design.  The power button and display are of very good quality and it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy.  
Fit and finish are excellent; the power cord is heavy-duty.  Consumer Reports loves this heater, and so do I.  Even at $60+, this heater is worth buying.  Highly recommended.

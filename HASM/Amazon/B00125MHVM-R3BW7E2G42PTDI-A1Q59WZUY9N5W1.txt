Title: Great Camera
Content:
I ordered this camera off amazon so i could get 1500 reward points on my amazon card; otherwise it is pretty much the same price everywhere.
This is my first SLR type camera and i am very pleased with it.  keep in mind that although i did a ton of research, i am writing this review with nothing to compare this camera to because i have never actually used another brand.  
I wanted an SLR camera for the shutter speed, quality of the pictures and zoom capabilities. so far i have been pleased with all of these options.  there are still many things i need to learn about the camera to really be able to use it to its full potential but i was able to take it out of the box and start taking nice pictures with the automatic settings.
for the money, the sony seems to be the best entry level camera.  it is cheap enough to feel like you can upgrade if you decided photography is your thing, and good enough to keep if you are just an amateur like myself.

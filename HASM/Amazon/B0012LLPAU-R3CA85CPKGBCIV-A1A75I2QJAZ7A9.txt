Title: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Content:
Comfort Zone heater SUCKS. I bought one of these heaters and am thoroughly disappointed. It will not turn on until it is really cold, like around 40-45 degrees or so. As a result i ended up using my old heater instead.
When it does turn on (which has been about five times this winter) it won't turn off automatically so the room just got hotter and hotter until i turned it off. I can't program it to turn on/off at certain times because that part doesn't work. 
I called customer service (which is lousy-you can't get them half the time after waiting a long time) and they told me to do this and that which i did, but nothing worked. I bought it in the summer when it became available so by the time i tried using it in the winter the money back guarantee was over.
So i'm stuck with a $400 piece of garbage. 
P.S. I have seen other reviews that say these units break down a lot. I never got mine to work long enough to break down these other ways. Do your homework and read the customer reviews online. This is too much money to throw away.

Title: GETS BETTER EVERY YEAR
Content:
Apple once again scores high, this is my fourth ipod, first I got the U2 20 GB special edition, then 60 GB Photo Ipod, then the 5th gen 60 GB video Ipod and now this beauty, I has great sound, great video cuality, love the new interface and what I love the best is the space. The interface is not as slow as some people claim, it just takes between 10 to 14 seconds to change menus. So if you are thinking of buying a new ipod, get this one.

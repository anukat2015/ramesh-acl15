Title: Great MP3 player at bargain price
Content:
This is a great MP3 player. Slow response time while selecting the songs but definitely woth the money I spent. FM transmitter that came free with this works perfectly. Overall I am happy with the player. I cannot compare this to Apple iPod because there is a huge price difference between tow.

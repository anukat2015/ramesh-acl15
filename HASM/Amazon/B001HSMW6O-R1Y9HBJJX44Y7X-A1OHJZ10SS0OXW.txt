Title: This is the best appliance I bought this year
Content:
because I needed a coffee pot that could fit under the low cabinets in my little kitchen and it works perfectly.
My partner installed the coffee maker in less than two hours.  We did have to run to a hardware store for a specific bit for the drill, and she did have to fiddle with the spacers because my cabinets are not standard issue.  The template was fine, and there weren't any major glitches at all.
The steaming hot coffee was ready when we woke up.

Title: Great little heater for the money
Content:
Pros:
1) This heater is effective and quiet.  I'm surprised at how quiet it is, given that is has a propeller fan (not a centrifugal fan), but it is sometimes hard to tell that it is "on", it is so quiet.
2) The design is excellent.  Very stable (even though it looks tippy).  High quality plastic casing.  Nice molded handle at the upper rear that makes it easy to pick it up and move it.
Cons:
1) The controls are hard to read; I had to actually read the instruction manual to see where the markings on the controls are located.  The markings are embossed into the white plastic without contrasting color.
2) It lacks an on/off switch (I unplug it to turn it off).
I almost gave it 5 stars because of its very high cost/benefit ratio.  It is not perfect, but is a great value for the relatively low price.

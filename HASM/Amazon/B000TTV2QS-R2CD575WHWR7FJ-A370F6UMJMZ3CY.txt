Title: I love this heater
Content:
I recommend this product to everyone who has trouble getting out of bed on those cold winter mornings. I just flip on the heater with a remote, without even leaving my bed. Within 10 minutes, my bedroom is 5 degrees warmer. 
I like this heater so much that I'm thinking of buying a second one for my living room. 
PROS:
lightweight
small
powerful heating
digital display
CONS:
power chord is a little too short
displayed temp. may not always be the temp of room

Title: IPOD Nano
Content:
Upgraded to the 8 GB nano, and it is great.  Was thinking of the video IPOD, but I am a runnner, and the weight of the nano is ideal.  Unless you are just downloading entire CD's, an 8 GB nano is more than enough for songs and pictures.  Also, I think that Apple will revise the video IPOD to look more like an IPhone, so if you are thinking about video vs. audio, I would wait.

Title: Very good but not quite great
Content:
A bit over priced the screen and keyboard are great  Would be better if it had more RAM and it has gotten very slow and I have only used 50GB of the 250GB HD space. The lap top gets very hot when on your lap and tends to overheat so I as I did I suggest you get an application where you can control the fan speed which helps. Operating system is very good.

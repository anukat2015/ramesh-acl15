Title: I never thought I'd say this but...
Content:
Do yourself a favor and stay away from Sony laptops and notebooks. I have been a SONY fan for ages, but this time they let me down to the extent that I'll never buy Sony again. I bought a Sony Vaio VGN FZ series and after 15 months the motherboard completely broke. It just shut off with no warning and I tried to get help from Sony but they have the worst techinical support in the USA; the only thing they do (after waiting several minutes on the phone for someone to take your call) is say "I am sorry for your inconvenience" or "send your laptop to the Service Center". I live in Virginia and their proposal was me to send the laptop to San Diego, CA!!!!! and I would have to run with all costs (including shipping) plus they told tha it would be more than 500 dollars to repair a laptop that costs 980 dollars brand new!!!!  I just gave up and wiil be definitely getting a new one; however, this time I am going to go for a Dell or HP because now I realize the importance of a good technical support.

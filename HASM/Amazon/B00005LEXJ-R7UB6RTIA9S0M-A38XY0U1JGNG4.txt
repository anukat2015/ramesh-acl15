Title: mr. heater potabble propane heater
Content:
i bought the heater for a 12 by 12 shed in the winter time. installing and lighting is very easy. after lighting the heater it  definately put out enough heat to warm a very non insulated tin shed. time spand was only about twenty minutes to warm up in about 35 degree weather.i am not shure how long it will run on a twenty pound bottle,because i only used it on low setting for about 8to 10 hours. the bottle has hardly any propane missing so it should last along time on low setting. over all a great portable heater.

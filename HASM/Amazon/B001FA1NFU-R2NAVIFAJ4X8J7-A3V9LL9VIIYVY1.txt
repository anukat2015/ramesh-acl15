Title: Know What You're Getting Into Before Purchasing!
Content:
Like others that have recently gotten the IPOD Nano 4th Generation.  I understand the grief over the previous IPOD accessories that are no longer compatible.  I received my IPOD Nano (hot pink) for Christmas only because my 3rd Gen. Nano (hot pink) cr*pped out on me.  (the screen went out in only 2 years of owning.  Never dropped, not left in a hot car or anything like that)  Anywho....  I received in December due to holiday and since then my Nano has been playing my music like skipped CD's.  It cuts the song off 1/2 way through, skips through the songs, cuts off the ending of the song.  None of my music is pirated.  They all came from CDs (which I got rid of before I moved) or through ITunes.  It is completely random on which songs it will do it to during play and I've returned the IPOD to factory settings with the same results.  All songs worked splendidly on my 3rd generation and continue to work just fine in ITUNES.  I also don't appreciate the shake to change feature which becomes super annoying if you're jogging and forgot to turn it off.  It only works when it wants to.  Also, it doesn't help that the only thing I can charge my Nano on is my computer.  1/2 the time I'm not home to keep tabs on it. It's an okay product, but I'd rather stick with the 3rd generation.  Now I've got a Nano I can't rely on until I get another one which might end up being 'refurbished' from the factory.  And my IPOD IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY!  Apple needs to get it together and send a product that will be reliable and compatible with the previous accessories that were available, if not, at least put it within the marketing plan (which that probably won't happen)

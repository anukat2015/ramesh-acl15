Title: Simply Superb
Content:
Having never used a DSLR/SLR camera in my whole life, I was very skeptical whether to buy this camera or not. Then, I did lot of research on different cameras, especially with the NIKON and the CANON cameras.  And atlast, I went with Nikon D200. It took some time for me to learn the basic features. But, once I learnt how to use the camera, then I came to know that this "piece of art" was doing some wonders. I'm actually enjoying the photography now. If you can afford to buy this camera then don't think twice. Go for it !!! One last thing, don't buy a crappy lens for this great camera.  I bought Nikon 18-200MM lens and this one too is a great piece like the D200 body and I highly recommend it.

Title: Decent product, EXCEPT...
Content:
I did a lot of researching about the iPod Nano before I put it on my Christmas list.  Though the black one definitely looked cooler, I read that they showed scratches and fingerprints more than the plain colorless model--so I decided to go for the white.  It is an ingenious design, sexy and sleek, but it lacks true durability.  The LCD screen is as easily scratched as Jessica Simpson is easily notorious for saying something blonde--a downfall for the overall superb Nano.  (So far) the iPod Nano has proven its worth save for the too high-price for a 2GB model, scratchable screen and outrageous prices for separate accessories (please, do lanyard headphones really cost $40??).  Now Apple just needs to fix those things and the iPod Nano could be THE perfect MP3 player!

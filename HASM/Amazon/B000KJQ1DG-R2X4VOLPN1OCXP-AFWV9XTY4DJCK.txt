Title: Camera
Content:
This camera is a dream.  It is very easy to use, even my husband picks up and uses it.  The pictures are very high quality, what it lacks in megapixels, it makes up for in every other aspect.  I don't miss the megapixels at all.Nikon D40 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens

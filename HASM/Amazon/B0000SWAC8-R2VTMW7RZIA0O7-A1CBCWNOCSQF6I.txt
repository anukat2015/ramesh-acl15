Title: A vacuum that really sucks.....all the dirt and hairs
Content:
The vacuum is really easy to use. The large wheels move over door sills and changes in florring with no problem. The power brush lifts alot of trapped dirt from carpets. My husband and I we about to buy the vacuum a few months ago. The salesman at LOWES told us that Electrolux was changing the design but not the quality. We waited and saw the deal on Amazon and bought it for less the $200 after the rebate.

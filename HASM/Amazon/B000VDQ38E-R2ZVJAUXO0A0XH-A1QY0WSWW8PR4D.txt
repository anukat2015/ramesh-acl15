Title: Great vacuum for the money.
Content:
I bought this vacuum as a replacement for my Dirt Devil. I'm really glad I decided to switch brands. I had no idea how much dirt my old vacuum was leaving behind. The Pet Hair Eraser definitely picks up the pet hair, but it also picks up the dust and dirt. I like to use Glade carpet fresh and I've heard that some vacuums don't really pick all of it back up and leave it in your carpet, this one actually sucks it back up. The canister is set up really well, because the filter is not in the canister as with some bagless vacuums. Also, the canister, filter and cyclone piece are all washable. 
The reason I'm only giving it four stars is due to the tools. They work pretty well, but not perfectly. I read the other reviews and I think that the ones that complain about the Turbo Brush may not have had the canister in properly. I found this out during the first use. You need to make sure the canister is securely seated before locking it into place. The suction decreases immensley if it is off by even a little bit. And then the Turbo Brush will not spin. However, if the canister is seated properly it produces plenty of suction to operate the Turbo Brush. The Contour Pet Tool works okay, but only for larger clumps of pet hair. 
Overall this is a great vacuum for the price. And I am definitely impressed with the suction. I'd recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a vacuum.

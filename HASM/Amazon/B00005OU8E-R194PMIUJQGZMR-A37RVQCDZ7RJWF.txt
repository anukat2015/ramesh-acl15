Title: Portable, safe, and easy to use
Content:
This heater works well for local heating rather than trying to heat an entire room.  We put it near the couch while watching tv on chilly nights -- to just take the edge off.  It starts easily and works for a number of hours on a propane canister.  The fan makes a big difference but does eat up batteries fairly quickly. Update (2/2004) -- The front screen simply fell off after over a year of heavy use and I was unable to reattach it.  I plan to buy another.

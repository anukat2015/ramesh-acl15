Title: Very Disappointing!
Content:
Very disappointing.  We purchased this thing because others in the house are more into coffee than I am and the reviews seemed to be good.  The coffee machine never worked correctly from the very first day.  It poured hot water every day onto the counter (mixed with coffee yuck!  So we took it back thinking it was faulty.  The next one did the same thing.  We tried different filters than the recommended ones and still the same result and ooey gooey yucky mess.

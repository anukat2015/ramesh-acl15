Title: Horribly disappointing.
Content:
My first combo machine was the original Krups Cafepresso, which I managed to actually wear out over the course of four years in college.  At roughly a third of the price, I wasn't expecting the Mr. Coffee ECM21 to be its equal, but neither was I expecting the cheap, flimsy, poorly designed POS I got.
The build quality is roughly equivalent to the $9.99 no-brand coffee makers you can buy in any grocery store, and in fact seems a little less sturdy than my last one of THOSE.  It's poorly designed as well, with a pivoting shower head that has to be rotated to the side to remove the drip basket, and swung back into place to brew.  Furthermore, to make it all fit in one package, Mr. Coffee chose to shrink the carafe to an 8-cup one, but made it so squatty and with such a tiny spout that any pour over a thin, tiny trickle sends coffee gushing down the side of the carafe and all over the counter.  It's possible to mostly get the hang of over time, but takes a ridiculously long time to fill a cup.
The espresso side of the operation is equally flimsy and too light, and seals badly. Sometimes an extra cupmark of water is enough to steam milk for a latte, sometimes it isn't.  Sometimes no matter how much extra you allowed, steam comes out of everywhere and you're left with lukewarm milk at best. Also, the cup is so flimsy and its handle so light that I fully expect it to be the first part of the machine to break.
Dreadful product.  For the price point, I wasn't expecting a Cadillac, but good functional design shouldn't add to a product's cost---it's just as easy to build a decent coffeemaker as a crappy one.  Save your money.

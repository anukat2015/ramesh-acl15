Title: Almost Professional
Content:
This is generally a great camera with a few things missing--a PC terminal for studio flash, the ability to make TIFF files in the camera (which the *istD did), and a really good finder.  I frequently shoot both slides and digital at the same time, and every time I use my 20 year old Pentax LX bodies I am reminded of just how bad most of the digital slr viewfinders really are--I haven't seen anything better from Canon or Nikon at this price range either.
In other respects, I have been quite pleased with it--image quality is good, controls seem fairly logical to me, and my large collection of older Pentax lenses works well with it.

Title: Asus UL80A
Content:
I've had this laptop for about 2 weeks now and I have to say that this is one of the bast laptops I have ever had. One of the things that you notice right away is the battery life. With my previous laptops I constantly had to check on the battery level to see if I had enough juice left but not with this one. The laptop is not heavy at all and it is extremely portable because of its size and weight. I am a student at WSU in Michigan and all my classes have the little tiny desks, and this laptop is just the perfect size. Some other great features that the laptop offers are the fast boot up, great display, stays nice and cool even after being on it for hours and hours. Overall I love the laptop. I have been in school all day since 10 this morning and it is now almost 8pm and I am still at 43% ( 5 hr 07 min)of battery. One thing that is kind of a pain is the sensitivity of the mouse pad but I got used to that in a day. Good job Asus, keep pumpin out these good laptops and you'll put hp, dell and gateway out of business in no time.

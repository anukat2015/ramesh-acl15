Title: Tiny, quick, great to warm your feet!
Content:
OK, I bought two of these in two weeks. Very happy with them. It's so small that you can literally move it anywhere with great ease. And since it's small and low, it can blow heat right at your feel and ankle. If you get cold feet like I do in winter, you are gonna love it. OK, I just mentioned another point I really like about it. It blows heat instead of radiating. So it feels quick. The second it's on, you feel the warmth from it. I got one for home and one for the office. They keep me very comfortable. I'm very happy about purchasing them!

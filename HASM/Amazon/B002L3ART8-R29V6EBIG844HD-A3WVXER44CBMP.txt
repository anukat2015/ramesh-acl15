Title: WOW!!
Content:
This vacuum cleaner rocks! It is compact, quiet, powerful, lightweight. Also has handy high/low speed switch. It also picks up fuzz, dog hair, pollen, etc... easily from the edges of our rooms with tiled floors. We have a cordless Electrolux stick vac we use in our RV, so we knew the canister vac had to be good as well. Highly recommended!!!

Title: Perfect for my college student
Content:
I bought this coffee maker for my college age daughter for x-mas.  I haven't given it to her yet, but I have tried it out a few times just to get the hang of it due to reviews about grounds spill-over, etc.  If you put in the correct amount of water and coffee it brews beautifully with no spill-over; however, it does take a full 5 minutes to finish the last few drips/drops.  If you wash the mug the first time you use it you get no rubbery taste.  The coffee tastes as good as the much more expensive Keurig, you can put a tall cup underneath, and clean-up is a snap.  This is perfect for those who don't feel the need to spend money needlessly.  I gave it four stars as I don't know how long it will last, but if it lasts her for the next 2-3 years I will be happy.

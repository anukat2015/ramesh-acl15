Title: Simple yet effective - requires special voltage and outlet
Content:
I live in Texas and have a 520 sq ft garage with ceiling/walls insulated, 1 car garage door not insulated and 3 windows.  I checked around for code requirements in our area and wired the 240 v/30 amp electrical myself. Mounted the unit hanging down from the ceiling, turned it on and in 2 hours it already had the upper half of the garage up to 60f degrees when 35f outside.  Let it run overnight and the garage was 75f next morning....low to mid 30s outside. Thermostat on the unit turns off the fan and heater coils once chosen temperature is reached.  Shipper had issues getting the unit shipped... stated waiting for manufacture to ship.  Per Amazon's recommendation, I had to send a followup e-mail to shipper to get status of shipment.  After that, the shipper sent status mails until the unit had a shipping tracking number.  If you need this unit, order early.  Took 2 weeks to arrive from the day I ordered it.  For our needs ... great price, compact unit and heats as expected.

Title: I don't understand everyone's problem with this coffee maker...
Content:
I love this coffee maker..we have had no problems with it what-so-ever. Finally, a caraffe that does not leak all over the place while pouring a cup of coffee...bravo Black & Decker for this sleek design. A little different looking than usual..but it doesn't leak!! & we've had none of the other problems that everyone else is talking about in their reviews. Maybe those users aren't doing something right or didn't install it correctly...I don't know. I recommend it & sorry if you have any of the problems that everyone else has if you based your purchase on my review...but I love it & have no complaints.   ok...hold up...as I'm typing this my husband said it overflowed everywhere yesterday...? Maybe I'll be back for a follow up. but we've had it for a month now & that is the 1st issue I've heard of so far.  I guess everything is entitled to a screw up once in a while right? Besides...it was probably operator error since it hasn't happened before & has only happened once.    :)

HP has really dropped the ball on these Pavilion laptops. Ever since HP bought Compaq (infamously famous for bad quality), HP's quality control has gone completely down the toilet. The Pavilion dv7 17" I purchased about 1 year ago has now stopped working. I've tried reinstalling the OS, updating all the drivers, and so on and so forth, yet nothing will keep this laptop from crashing. It is now suffering from hardware failure. That might be acceptable on a much older model, but definitely NOT on a system only 1 year old. Apparently this isn't that uncommon of a problem with these particular HP laptops. I won't even go into all the technical issues I've had with this laptop since it was initially purchased, just be aware that there were quite a few. Simply put, don't buy an HP laptop. Go with a different company if at all possible. Otherwise your laptop might be worthless in a relatively short period of time like mine has become.

Title: Panasonic Vacuum Cleaner Review
Content:
This vacuum is light and easy to use.  The best feature is the ability to go from hardwood floors to carpet by sliding a button.  It cleans well.  The two negatives are 1) the "upholstery brush" is too small to do any good, and 2) the bags fill up quickly as they are small.  This does not prevent me from recommending this vacuum cleaner however.

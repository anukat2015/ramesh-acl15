Title: Outstanding Heater!
Content:
I can't add much to what good that's already been said about this heater.  It's safe and works like a charm.  I CAN put to rest the the "filter" issue the one joker has been harping on.  There's no doubt it's the same idiot making this bogus claim.  In their last post they said "my manual says that if you use the unit with bulk propane, it "must" only be done with their official connector dongle and filter"  Uh huh...  Well here's a suggestion for anyone that wants to see this liar exposed.  There's a link in this ad section where you can view or downloand the manual for this heater.  Read through it or do a search for the words "filter", "dongle", or even the word "bulk" and you WILL NOT FIND IT.  There is ZERO mention of this imaginary filter.  Nor will you find it in any of the documentation that comes with your heater.  The filter doesn't exist!  Whoever made up that filter and has kept coming back to the reviews harping on it has some serious mental problems.  Give it a rest already!

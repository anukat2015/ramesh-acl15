Title: Well-made product!
Content:
I recieved this laptop yesterday (2/5/10)and here is my review: When I removed the laptop from the box and held it, I was impressed with the laptop's construction.  The keyboard is big enough for my hands, and the 13.3 inch screen is large enough for me to see.  The laptop is not too heavy--but it is not too light.  Unlike a netbook, this laptop has 320gb of hardrive and 4gb of rams, expandable to 8gb (that's very powerful for this little machine!).  It has four usb ports and a hdmi port for hooking it up to a big screen TV.  It also has a webcam camera and an internal microphone.  The laptop is loaded with Windows 7 Home Premium for stability and a lot of HP software junk.  The laptop has Bluetooth technology to communicate with other Bluetooth devices.  The laptop doesn't have a fixed optical drive, which is cool since most software can be downloaded from the Internet.  In closing, if you need a smaller laptop for just basic computing, a netbook will suffice.  However, I would STRONGLY recommend you to spend more money on a laptop like the HP Pavilion DM3-1130US model, because sooner or later you will need a smaller laptop like this one for heavy duty computing.

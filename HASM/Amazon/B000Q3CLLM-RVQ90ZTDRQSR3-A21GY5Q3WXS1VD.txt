Title: Complete garbage
Content:
This thing does not work as advertised.
If you put in some ice cubes and water from the tap, you get some cooling action for about 5 minutes, after that you get a lot of noise from the fan and some added humidity to the room.  This is nothing at all like a swamp cooler.
I tried completely filling the tray with ice cubes and pouring in 35 degree water chilled in the refrigerator overnight.  I got some cooling effect for about an hour, after that it's back to being a slightly humid fan even though the water is still ice cold in the tray.  Also, if you add too many ice cubes, the bottom of the tray will consdense and you will have a nice puddle underneath your unit.
After two weeks and using it 10 times for spans of 3-6 hours, the fan motor stopped working.  I was able to return this piece of junk and am glad to be rid of it.  This unit is also apparently branded as the SPT SF-613.

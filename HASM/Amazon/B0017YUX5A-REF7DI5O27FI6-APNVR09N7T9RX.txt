Title: Hoover windtunnel anniversary edition
Content:
I purchased the hoover anniversary edition wondering if I paid a lot of money for another piece of junk.  I am plesantly surprised at how well I like this vacuum.  The cleaning power is fabulous.  I have 4 rescue cats and they shed a lot.  This vacuum sucks up everything and there is no odor with the allergen bags.  It is easy to use and I am generally happy with it.  The bags are the easiest to change of any I have ever had.  The only cons are that it is a little awkward getting around corners with the small wheels and the on/off control is on the body of the vacuum instead of the handle.  Overall I think it is a great and would purchase again.  Sam T.

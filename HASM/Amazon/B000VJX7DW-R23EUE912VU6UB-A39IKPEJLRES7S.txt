Title: Simply Outstanding
Content:
The Good:
For as many features as they packed into the camera...it is incredibly easy to use.  Active D-lighting is nice and the color space adds depth and saturation to the images.  Speed is incredible: 2.5fps in RAW, 6fps in TIFF or JPG Fine/Large.  Live view is easier to use than the manual makes it out to be, and a nice addition for tripod/studio work (no kneeling or step stool to run the camera when its mounted.)  My Menu personalization is great...I can pick the features I use the most, put them in one place and organize them how I want.  No more digging through 4 pages of CSM to change the self timer etc.
The not quite as good:  
I don't care for the release mode dial...a bit hard to manipulate using one hand with the lock, but it did not take much to get used to it.  
Software wise...Capture NX is good, but cumbersome to use.  My advice is use it if it is free, but if you already have PS Lightroom or CS3 they are still the better choice.  Capture NX and Camera Control are nice for the camera enhancements they add, but I am not sure how much I will use them.
Of course the price is high as is the price for almost all accessories (hence the 4 stars vice 5), but you get what you pay for.  And, with the D300...you get a lot.  It will make a great primary camera for any user as well as a better-than-your-normal-secondary camera for professional shooters using it as a backup to the D3!

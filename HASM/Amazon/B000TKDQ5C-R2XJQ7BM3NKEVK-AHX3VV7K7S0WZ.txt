Title: Great Heater for the Money!
Content:
Based on other reviews found here, I bought this heater for my living quarters here in Iraq.  My room is small, so it does great job heating it up quickly, especially when the door is opened.  Yes, it does get cold in Iraq during the winter; especially at night and the early morning hours.
I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a small area to heat quickly/consistently.  I almost forgot to mention, this heater is virtually silent!

Title: Great Cocoa-Latte Maker
Content:
This is a great little hot cocoa maker.  It stirs the chocolate completely and adds the perfect amount of froth.  The temperature is not boiling hot but the right temperature for immediate drinking.  Comes apart for easy cleaning although not in the dishwasher.  Wrap-around cord storage underneath is nice.  A huge thumbs-up especially for the price.

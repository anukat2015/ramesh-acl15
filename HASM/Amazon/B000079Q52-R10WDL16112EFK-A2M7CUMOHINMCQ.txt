Title: It's Bright!
Content:
My heater just arrived &amp; I gotta say.....it's making me want to confess to crimes I didn't commit....lol.  I can't complain about it's warming qualities because I'm already warm &amp; toasty.  Get one if you don't mind the brightness....or buy some shades.  I bought this because it's quiet but hope tonight when I try to sleep it won't make me &quot;come to the light Laurie.....come to the light!&quot;.

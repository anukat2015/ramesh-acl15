Title: a short lived love affair
Content:
This vacuum is outstanding the first few months you use it.  Excellent suction, the gratification of seeing all the crud you are vacuuming up... Then it all ends.  We have only had this vacuum for 6 months, and only have one 9X12 rug in our home with the rest being wood floors.  We do also have pets, so I would call our house medium duty for vacuuming.  A few months after we had this cleaner, the suction decreased greatly.  (Just when you've let your guard down and lost the receipt.)  It now takes about 1/2 hour to vacuum our 9X12 rug with poor results.  To try to optimize it's suction, I'm constantly cleaning the filters and hand washing the canister and attachments.  Even with this, the performance is substandard.  I wish I had my old vacuum back.  I've noticed that this vacuum has received glowing reviews, and I would have given it the same reviews if I had rated it in the first few months of ownership.  It doesn't last.

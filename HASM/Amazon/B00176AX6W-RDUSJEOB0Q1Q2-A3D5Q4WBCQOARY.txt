Title: Zune 80 ROCKS!!!!!
Content:
Thought I'd get by with my Zune 30 but then I found an 80 at Target, couldn't pass up the chance to snag one.  And wow is this thing a step up from the 30! The size is great, the screen is amazing and the addition of the new zunepad is excellent.  Showed it off to a few friends and they were all pretty impressed.  The software layout is nice and hopefully they'll be adding more functionality to it over time with updates. But the player is just great!

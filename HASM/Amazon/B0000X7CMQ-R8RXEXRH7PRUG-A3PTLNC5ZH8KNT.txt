Title: Greatly disappointed
Content:
After reading Consumer Reports and the reviews at this web site, I bought a Zojirushi Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe coffee maker from Amazon in February of 2005.  I was somewhat disappointed at first because we felt the coffee should have been hotter when freshly brewed.  I was even more disappointed when it stopped working correctly in August of 2005. I had paid an above average price for what I had hoped would be an above average coffee maker and it will no longer stay on long enough to brew 10 cups of coffee.  You must babysit the machine and re-push "on" when it stops, after brewing only 2 or 3 cups of coffee. You have to do this several times to get 10 cups of coffee. But my greatest disappointment came when dealing with Zojirushi America.  In order to get my 6 month old, above average coffee maker repaired, I have to get a larger box than the original container, (according to the company the original container is not suitable for shipping) place the coffee maker inside the original carton, then place the original carton inside the larger box with extra padding and pay for INSURANCE and POSTAGE both TO and FROM the company's service center in Calif.  (They have very few service centers in the U.S.) My failure to do so may cause my request for service to be denied. Not very consumer friendly for a problem the customer service representative admitted was one they had experienced before.  My advice - Don't buy the thing.

Title: Great camera
Content:
I've had this camera for only a couple of months. I've been very happy with it. It will probably do more than I will ever need. I'm still learning and seem to find something new every time I use it. It has a very solid feel to it. It may be a little too big and heavy for someone who just wants a camera for point and shoot but that's not what it is made for (although you can do that). It has two shooting modes that you can set up for shots that you use often. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to shoot quickly, you can turn the mode to your saved settings and start shooting. It takes files large enough that you can crop it and still make large prints. Also got a great price at Amazon.

Title: Love this Camera!!!!
Content:
My wife and I bought this camera to get ready for the birth of our daughter, and have been seriously impressed.  We own two film Rebel SLR's and our experience with Canon products continues to be great.  It was a huge relief to not have to buy new lenses since we can use the same lenses we had for the film versions of this camera.  The images are pristine, the on-board menus are intuitive, and shooting with this camera is just hands down fun!  I strongly recommend this product if you are considering a DSLR.

Title: mini but &quot;expensive&quot; ipod
Content:
when ipod unmini version first released in taiwan, i was shocked by its no-button and apple-style design, but i didn't buy it, cause its size is just too big and cannot support video type files.today, people also shocked by mini version ipod, but if you compare it's specification, you will find it still unsupport video files, and it's storage/price is very low, $249 plus $20 can buy 10GB unmini version ipod in amazon.If you don't care what i say, and want use a special version iPod different with what someone used before, mini iPod is your best choice, trust me^^

Title: A truely functional vacuum for your home!
Content:
I had my doubts on Hoover, it being a old stogy brand and all!  But this product suprised me.  I bought it for its size and innovative shape.  But the operation of it and how well it cleans not only did not disappoint me, it worked quite well.  The on/off switch being on the hose, the adapters, the variable suction power, the floor/carpet adapter, all did a superb job.  The 1st thing I did was to use the upholstry adapter and vacuum my couch.  It was great.  I checked the dust compartment and it was half full afterward.
The floor piece which has a wind tunnel is low profile and gets under all furnitre and table heights. All in all, a great vacuum.
A few things to improve would be:  1) Make the third wheel of the vacuum body bigger so it can maneuvered easier.  It gets stuck on smallest obtacles.  2) I would have enjoyed an 1" 1/4 hose adapter with a a bristle brush type for dusting and getting into small areas.  3) The floor sweeper piece in it upright and locked position does not stand stationary all the time.  The top part is too heavy and its weight makes the handle to fall. One has to lock it and lean in against the wall when stowing it away.
But it works great.  I am happy with it.

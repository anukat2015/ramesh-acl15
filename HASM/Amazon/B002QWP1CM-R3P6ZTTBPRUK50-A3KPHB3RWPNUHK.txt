Title: Horrible all the way around.
Content:
Ok, I order the heater and they ship a used (obviously returned) unit out to me.  I contact them about this and they give me the run around and keep asking if the unit is damaged.  I ask why the unit was returned, they don't answer.  I ask them to CC Amazon on the emails they are sending, they don't.  They offer me $30 to keep the used unit, I say no, just send me a shipping label to send it back for a refund.  They say "we don't send out shipping labels."  I contact Amazon and ask them to step in.  They send me a shipping label.  I tried out the unit and it didn't heat even half of the square footage it promised.  What a disaster.

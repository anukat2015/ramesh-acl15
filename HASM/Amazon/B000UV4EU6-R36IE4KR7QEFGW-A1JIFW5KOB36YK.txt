Title: Not As Good As It Seems
Content:
I do not own this product but a friend of mine does. This worked great as a mp3 player but the video aspect of this device (what it is marketed as) is subpar. It does not accept all formats in its conversion and worst of all when you can get something to convert there is a time lapse between the video and the sound.
My friend bought this because he travels a lot and wanted to watch movies on flights. With a long Video (over 30 min) the sound gets about 1 second off for every 30 mins or video. You may not notice it at first but by the end of the movie you will be tearing your hair out in frustration.
The picture viewer is one of the finer aspects of the Zen. It works well for showing off your pictures and the slideshow viewer works pretty good. You can also use it as a giant flash drive if you want to.
I am giving this device a 2 out of 5 stars because even though it works well as a picture viewer and mp3 player you can buy other creative products that do the same thing for $200 less. The fact that the video does not sync up with the audio and the poor file format support makes it not as good as its predecessor the Zen Vision W.

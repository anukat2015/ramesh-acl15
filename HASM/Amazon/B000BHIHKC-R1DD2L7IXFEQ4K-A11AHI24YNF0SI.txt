Title: junk
Content:
This machine is garbage.  Get a $20 4-cup programmable coffee pot instead--it will make actual, real, drinkable coffee, as opposed to the coffee-scented hot water this machine produces.  I am giving mine to charity.  N.B.: the "presto" thingie to use your own coffee instead of pods that amazon will try to sell you with it does not work with this machine.

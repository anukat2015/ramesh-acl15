Title: great heater! highly recommended!
Content:
I love this little heater! I bought this to help heat my trailer. It does such a great job that my furnace has hardly kicked on, even on the 32 degree and below nights we have already had! I really like how you can set the temperature and the heater actually seems to run and heat according to the actual room temp, not the heaters temp or the immediate areas temp. When I was out looking at heaters, a Lowe's employee told me that the thermostat is on the top of the heater so the closer to the floor you can place it the more accurate the heater's thermostat will read, so therefore the heater will run more accurately. I have mine set about 18" off the floor at one end of a 450sq. ft area. My thermostat is across the room and reads fairly close to what I have the heater set for!!! 
I also bought this for the safety features. The outside stays cool and if it tips over it shuts off. I have a curious 1 year old so these features were very important to me. It also has a slim design so it fits well up buy the wall out of the way. It is pretty quiet too.
I highly recommend this heater and intend to buy one for my bedroom as well!

Title: worth $150
Content:
You cant expect a 150 vacuum to compete with a 400-550 dyson machine. i mean really think about it . if your willing to drop a half a G on a vacuum perhaps you should look into getting a maid service. look dysons a great product but come on its a vacuum for your house not a space shuttle . This vacuum does the job and never lost suction the whole time. there is a rubber grommet between the cannister and the vac. so i dont know where that comes from.as far as hardwood floors . vacuums gernerally dont do a good job on hard floors thats not why they were made thats why we have brooms. however if you shut off the brush the small particles dont shot around your floor if you so chose to use it to do hard flooring.
in the end its a matter of cost vs useage.

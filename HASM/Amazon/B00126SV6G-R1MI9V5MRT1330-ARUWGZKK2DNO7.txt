Title: Luv this thing!
Content:
This is a really cool item, made by Creative, but I managed to get a brand new one a little bit cheaper on Amazon! I hate to admit, but it took me a few min. to get how to use the player, but once I did, I thought that it was the coolest thing! It has a nicely sized display screen (that's full of color), its got great sound, and pretty easy to manage, once connected to your computer! I'm a little sad, because I only got the 4GB, and I shouldv'e gotten the 8GB, because now, I want to put ALL my stuff on this cute little thing. It's pretty lightweight, but you can tell that its made of durable material and the battery life is really long. If you purchase this product, you're gonna like it! So, I recommend getting the 8GB one, get the little leather cover case to keep that shiny black pristine, and get the car charger for it, because you'll use it more often away from your home and pc. Great product!

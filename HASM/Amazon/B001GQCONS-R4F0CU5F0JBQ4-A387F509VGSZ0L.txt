Title: Another Inferior Dell POS Laptop!
Content:
Wow! I wish i had this customer's Mini 9 instead of the one I bought.  I've owned mine for 3.5 months now & can honestly say that it's the biggest P.O.S. I've ever owned.  Currently I'm fighting Dell about all the issues I've experienced owning it - it freezes up constantly (3-4x a day) requiring a reboot to fix the problem, overheats after 2 hours of use, mine advertised a 4GB SSD hard drive, but have only 1.7GB free space (we've downloaded nothing onto it and 1x a day-we clear the cache, delete temp files, etc...and it still states only 1.7GB free space), you cannot use java applets on the Mini 9, streaming audio/video is choppy at best/doesn't work at all at worst...and the list goes on & on.   Dell's official stance on the Mini 9 (which, btw, Dell discontinued selling as of June 1st) is that it's purely for checking email only.  Seriously...3 of their tech support managers have told me this.  All these problems have been reported 5 different times (and it's been sent into Dell for repairs 3x), and I'm tired of screwing with Dell & their lack of customer service.  Michael Dell should be embarrassed by his company's customer service/tech support (which he's outsourced to Bangalore, India).  They lost a lifelong customer (over the past 4 years, I've spent $6,000 with Dell).  Run fast & far from anything Dell.

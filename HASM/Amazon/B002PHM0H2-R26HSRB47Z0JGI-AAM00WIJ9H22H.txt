Title: Beautiful screen
Content:
Pros:
- Wide & bright screen, good enough to watch movies. 
- Fancy body design, looks beautiful. 
- Spaced keys, makes typing very comfortable.
- good quality webcam/mic that works in low light and can track face movements. 
Cons:
- Short Battery life.
- Does not have the modem jack as it shows in the product description and the picture. 
- No backup OS DVD. Recovery partition on HDD. 
Overall a good desktop replacement.

Title: You can trust Amazon buying  an used item.
Content:
I bought an used Nikon D80 10.2 Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-135 AF-s DX Zoom Nikkor Lens.
It was a very good experience buying this camera, not only because the price, but it cames in the original box as a new one with and as described in Amazon page.
I am taking the most beautiful photos I have never taken.

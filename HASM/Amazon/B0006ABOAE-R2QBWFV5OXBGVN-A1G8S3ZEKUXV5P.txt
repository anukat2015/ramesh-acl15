Title: Very decent machine
Content:
I had a DeLonghi combo machine before this (slightly higher in price, but comparable), and had lots of problems, including that it only lasted for about a year.  This one seems to be constructed better.  I like the ease with which the steam vessel is closed, the screw cap is very secure, and easy to tighten.  The frother spout swings to the side, which helps keep it out of the way when not in use.  On the coffee maker side, the lift out basket makes it easy to remove the grounds.  
     Problems?; only one really, and that is very minor.  The decanter: the lid only lifts up a bit unless you take it completely off.  It gets in the way when filling and rinsing, also the shape of the spout makes coffee spill out the side slightly, if you pour it too fast.
     Overall, I'm really happy with this machine...it's easy to use, and so far, seems like it's going to last.

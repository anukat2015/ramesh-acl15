Title: lots of heat , works great
Content:
I manage several buildings that feature these, They are very common in apartments and they work very well.  Lots of heat, pretty low noise, and they take up very little wall space; just don't place furniture too close to them and vacuum the grill out once a year.  These are often run by a wall thermostat; over-riding the built-in one.

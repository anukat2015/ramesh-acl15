Title: Not worth the money
Content:
We bought this vacuum about a year ago because we wanted a lightweight vacuum that would be easy to drag around the house.  It was also relatively cheap.
At first we were very pleased with the vacuum.  It did everything as advertised.  The unit itself still seems to run well.
This product has a HUGE flaw, in that the attachment "blades" are driven by the same air that is used to suck up dirt.  These attachments get clogged.  This, of course, renders the vacuum useless, as it no longer picks debris up off the carpet.  I spend more time keeping this thing running than vacuuming my house.  Further, even after cleaning it, it is never quite as good as it was the time before.
I have finally given up on this vacuum and will be purchasing a new one.
The only time you should purchase this vacuum is if
 - You do not mind re-purchasing new attachments every year or so (I have not attempted to do this, and do not know how easily it can be done)
 - You want a lightweight vacuum
 - You want a cheap vacuum, despite the fact that it will not remain effective very long

Title: LOVE MY NEW VAC
Content:
I am very happy with my new vacuum. I am amazed at all the dirt it picks up. Works wonderfuly on carpets but not so much on wood floors. The floor attacment won't even fit under my couch and the suction is not so great. So I just use a floor duster to get under there. But it has exceeded my expectations on my carpets! Also when I got the vacuum the handle on the dirt canister was cracked in half...I'm sure I could have exchanged it but I just taped it up with electrical tape and its holding up great.

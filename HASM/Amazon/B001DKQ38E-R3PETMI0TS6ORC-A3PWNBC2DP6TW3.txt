Title: Poor design... not a 'thermal carafe' as advertised
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker to replace an older (14+ years!) Braun model which was getting noticeably slower despite repeated cleanings.
All I wanted was a no frills, four cup, coffee maker. The 'thermal carafe' was a bonus.
What I received was a unit, without instructions for use, which has a cheap plastic, double-walled carafe posing as 'thermal'. There were no starter filters included and those needed remain a mystery. I suspect that, being the type of appliance found in motel rooms, coffee pods are required.
I tried three pots of coffee with mixed results. None were drinkable...
I returned the coffee maker and purchased a model at WalMart. I ignore its digital timer and life is good!

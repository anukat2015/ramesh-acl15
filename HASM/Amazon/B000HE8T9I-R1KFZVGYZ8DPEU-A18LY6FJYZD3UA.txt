Title: Great at first...
Content:
I thought this was a great vacuum at first. Strong suction. Picked up everything (cat hair and all). I was amazed at how much it did pick up. I have hardwood floors as well as area rugs in my house, so I was looking for a vacuum that will work on both surfaces. It did for the first 7 months.
I have cleaned all the the foam, filter and cyclones when it stopped working...I used it twice after that and it stopped working again.
It didn't even last for a year and now I have to look for another vacuum. Very disappointing.

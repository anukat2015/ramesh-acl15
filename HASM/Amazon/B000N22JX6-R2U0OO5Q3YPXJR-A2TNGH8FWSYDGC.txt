Title: Lasko makes a great heater!
Content:
I purchased this heater for an elderly friend of our family, to replace a much older Lasko model. The unit is smaller than the old model but puts out as much heat or more. It doesn't seem to rotate as far, but the directional coverage is still substantial and provides great relief in a cold room. If my home have a small unheated space, and I needed a heater to provide comfort, this snazzy looking model is the one I would select.

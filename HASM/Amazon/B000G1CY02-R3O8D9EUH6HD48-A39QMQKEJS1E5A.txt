Title: Works fine for smaller rooms
Content:
The product works as advertised for the small room in which I use it. (Roughly 400 sq ft) I generally set it on full blast for about 30 min to an hour, then adjust the settings to maintain the heat.  By then, the room is well heated.  It certainly wouldn't be of any use in a decent sized home, but in a small apartment, it works just fine.

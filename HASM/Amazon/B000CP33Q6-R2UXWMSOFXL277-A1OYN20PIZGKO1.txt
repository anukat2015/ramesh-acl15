Title: Its iight
Content:
I've had my Coby Mp-C751 for 1 one day and ive found the few little problems about:
1. Certain songs will not play if they are protected.
2. The exterior feels kinda cheap.
3. You can't drag and drop.
4. Is not reconized by windows XP 03.
The good parts:
1. Great FM tuner.
2. The earphones are off the chain.
3. It's small and sleek.
In other words, besides the few problems, It's a wonderful player.

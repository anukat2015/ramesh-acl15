Title: Great product
Content:
I am kind of new to the DSLR photography, but I think this camera is awesome. The picture quality is outstanding. The controls are very easy to use. The menu is self explanatory and intuitive. I love big LCD display, that allows to see the picture quality right after taking the picture.
The two things I would improve:
 - replace menu navigation buttons with something that responds better (e.g. scrolling ring) 
 - the grip. It seems like I could use a bit more handle.  
The lens works great for me. It has a decent angle for taking pictures inside and outside. 
For taking pictures indoors I would definitely recommend adding an external flash also from Canon.

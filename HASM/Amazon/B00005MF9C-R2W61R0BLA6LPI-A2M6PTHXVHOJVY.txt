Title: perfect for one
Content:
I purchased this for my mother for Christmas.  She really needed a coffee maker that was more reliable.  This one is perfect.  It has a reusable coffee filter, makes a perfect cup of coffee at a simple push down of a lever that automatically shuts the coffee maker off when done.  No more worries about a coffee pot left on, burnt coffee or a coffee maker that over flows.  
This one is so simple and easy to clean and you can use more than just the travel mug under it.  I would recommend this to anyone who is not a big coffee drinker or who really likes the taste of a fresh brewed cup of coffee.

Title: QC needs major improvement
Content:
Just got the laptop a two days ago. The laptop is light and is a great for someone who doesn't need a lot of power. If you to replace a desktop with this laptop, you need to continue looking as this laptop just doesn't have that kind of  power. (It's a bit slow to start up) But what irked me the most is that the laptop came damaged. the keyboard is stuck and i have to pry it up with a key...good thing Amazon is taking care of it for me. Otherwise, i'd have to deal directly with Acer and that won't be good.

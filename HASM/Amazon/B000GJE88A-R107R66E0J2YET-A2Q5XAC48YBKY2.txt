Title: Not perfect, but better choice than Ipod, in my opinion
Content:
With a price so much better than video IPods of similar memory capacity, the excellent sound quality, compatibility with so many formats, and nice picture quality, I would say that this is a good buy. The batteries charge quickly and I've had it last about 15 hours playing music. I've had mine for quite a while now, and have had no major problems with it. But I wouldn't call it an IPod killer. For one thing, I am fairly computer-savvy, but I couldn't get mine to sync with Windows Media player, and it wouldn't play DRM-protected files. It took a while to work through this, because the Meizu help site was obviously written by people whose first language is NOT English. In the end I had to download WinAmp to sync with my player. It also lacks some features that IPod has; for instance, the playlist features are very lacking, and creating a playlist is a laborious process. You can't even play music by genre. Finally, Meizu doesn't have nearly the amount of accessories available that IPod has. There isn't even a speaker-dock available. Yes, you can use generic speakers, but you have to use cables. Even so, if I had to choose again, I'd still get this just because the price and format compatibility is so much better.

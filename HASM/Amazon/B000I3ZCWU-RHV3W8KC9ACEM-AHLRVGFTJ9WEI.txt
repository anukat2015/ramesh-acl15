Title: Simply amazing
Content:
I've had this camera for almost two years now, and I've taken well over 10,000 pictures with it. I've never been happier with this digiecam than with any camera I used before. I went from a 35mm SLR to a hi-grade P&S digital, and then to the XTi; and haven't looked back since.
I'll be upgrading to the XSi in the near future, basically the same camera with a little bit higher resolution sensor, live view and a few other bells and whistles.

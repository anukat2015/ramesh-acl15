Title: iPod's Great...Headphones notta
Content:
This review isn't for the iPod as much as it is for the headphones included...
The ipod works fine, I love it. The problem is that my headphones have gone bad...by now I've had to throw them away.
The headphones started breaking down a little while ago when one of the earpeices was making a deafening buzzing sound for no reason--I ended up cutting that headphone off. The other (I could only listen with one ear) worked okay until yesterday, when it actually shocked me in my ear. Very painful.
I don't have an earwax problem, and the headphones were covered in the little black foam pads included. But really--the thing shocked the inside of my ear, almost like the feeling of touching an electric fence, but INSIDE YOUR EAR..
I have to get new headphones. I don't know if it's just mine (it may not be, because this has happened to a few people I know) but if you're gonna get this, be careful with the headphones. Or just get some new ones.
Getting shocked in the ear hurts, people. Trust me!

Title: DO NOT BUY
Content:
I wish I had listened to the reviews, and did not purchase this vacuum in June of 09. I have had  2 Kenmores since 1983, and never was so frustraighted as I am with this product. It constantly clogs, and now the beater bar just quit! We have no small children and 1 short haired cat. I have all hardwood or tile and only use the beater bar for the family room. It is a peice of JUNK!

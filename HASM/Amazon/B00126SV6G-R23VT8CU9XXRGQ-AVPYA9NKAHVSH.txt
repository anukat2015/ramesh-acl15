Title: Great Player
Content:
This is my second ZEN player.  The first was begged from me by my (jealous!) son!  His didn't have as many features as the ZEN.  It has a great, sharp video display, an FM receiver that really performs, and plenty of audio and display trims to make it yours.  Oh, and of course, IT PLAYS AUDIO FILES!  Ok, it doesn't play ITUNES files directly, "but I have ways to make it play".  Like some others shared in other forums, it can lock up.  I've only experienced it twice, once on the "old" player and once on the "new".  I wish Creative would make the recovery software more easily found on their web site, but it's there.  I found it on forum boards.  The only other issue that I have is a noticably lower output.  If you feed an external amplifier, your volume will have to rise.  If you are an earbud listener, PERFECT!  Flash memory doesn't mind jolting from jogging.  Great for mass transit!  Yup, I have sevaral MP3 players, including the ZUNE and other major brands--but no Ipod.  I would buy another and recommend the ZEN to anyone.

Title: I like it.
Content:
The Ipod Nano is prolly one of the best Christmas prsents i have ever gotten. It is almost amazing how much it can do and its so small. The only thing i can recommend is that u get switch carriors, it took DHL almost 2 and a half weeks to deliver it, there for I didnt get it untill after Christmas, but other then that i love it.

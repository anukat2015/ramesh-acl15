Title: Fire Hazzard
Content:
We received this heater as a wedding gift in 2008. We use it intermittently in the fall and spring to heat up our cold bathroom before washing our kids. When I unplugged it the other night the cord was extremely hot and the area around the prongs was burned. The heater had been on for less than an hour. If this was plugged in near a carpet or curtain it would have caught on fire. I agree that it is loud too, but my babies loved the white noise.

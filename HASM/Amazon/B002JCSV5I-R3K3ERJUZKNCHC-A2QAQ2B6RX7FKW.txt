Title: Excellent Entry Level DSLR
Content:
I am new to the DSLR world, I was just looking for a quality, easy to use entry level camera. I decided to go with the Nikon D3000 based on reviews and recommendations. It is incredibly easy to use right out of the box, the guide mode is great to help you out as well.  The only thing missing with this camera is a live view, which to me is not a big deal, but it would be nice to have the option.  Other than that this camera is great, I'm a beginner and I've already taken some great photographs, so much better than the normal point and shoot.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for an entry level DSLR.

Title: Perfect all around camera for every use
Content:
Sure there are other competitors to the XTi like the Nikon D80, Sony, Olympus but for the money you can't possibly beat the quality.  This IS your best bang for the buck.  I have had my XTi for 1 month already and absolutely love it!!  From portraits to landscapes to landscape photography, this camera does it all.  I highly recommend this camera for all level photographers.

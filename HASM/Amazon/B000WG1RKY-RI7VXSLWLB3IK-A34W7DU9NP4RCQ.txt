Title: I don't regret it at all
Content:
I love this Zune, I really don't regret not taking an iPod like my Uncle tried to strong arm me into doing. I can connect to my network with this, I enjoy the software's layout/design, and the shape of the Zune is so pleasant. The sound quality, I hear no loss in sound quality from my Computer. I'm likely getting my own earphones as I have difficulty keeping them in but other than that I'm very satisfied I decided to buy this.

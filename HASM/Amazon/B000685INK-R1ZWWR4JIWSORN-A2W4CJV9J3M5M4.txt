Title: Dayton 3VU36 (in lieu of Marley)
Content:
Why am I reviewing a Dayton in lieu of Marley? Because I ordered the Marley but I received the Dayton. The unit has the same specs as the Marley and it performs well so I am keeping it, rather than going through the a return and reordering from a different supplier (plus it is cold out and we need it now for a band rehearsal studio). I am down grading to three stars (from the five that the unit deserves) since we were not notified that the it would be a substitute product.  The delivery time was excellent (especially during the week before Christmas).  Also, I called the supplier and they were willing to take the unit back if I was not satisfied (I give them credit for that).

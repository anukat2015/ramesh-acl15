Title: Favorite Heater
Content:
I bought this a few months ago and haven't stopped using it. My wife is a heat junky and we used to fight over the thermostat - not anymore. We spend most of our time sitting in either the family or bedroom. When this is near, it is very unlikely that she will crank up the heat. Our home is fairly large and we could use another one. This is our first radiant heater and I would definitely buy another one of these. I gave it fours stars because it's hard to see the dial indicator on the front. But that's nothing a little finger nail polish can't fix.

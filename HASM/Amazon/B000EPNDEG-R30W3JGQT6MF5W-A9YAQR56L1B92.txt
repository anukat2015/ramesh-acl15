Title: The Best !!
Content:
The 30gig ipod is GREAT ! I have had it for almost a month now . I wondered at first if it would hold as much music and movies/video's as I would want . I am here to say , it holds a lot . I have completely enjoyed using it . I have downloaded itunes 7.3 , it will even take your old music files and add them to the itunes library  to download onto your player . 
I have mine in black and I would recommend finding a good case for it . 
When playing Music the battery life is long . When playing video's the battery life is med . When playing movies , you can get thur one movie and then need to recharge or be close to needing too . The picture is so clear and bright . I was completely amazed at how small the screen is but how well I could see everything . This is well worth the money and you can change what you want to keep on and off it . If you are someone who wants to keep over the top huge amounts of music then you might want to go for the 80 gig . I have found that the 30 is more then enough for the average user and again .. so easy to use . Itunes store makes it the best and easiest way to download and play your music .. the earbuds that come with it have a great sound also .

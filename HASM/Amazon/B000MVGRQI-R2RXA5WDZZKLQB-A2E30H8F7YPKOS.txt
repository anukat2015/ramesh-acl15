Title: lots of suction, poorly designed details
Content:
the suction cant be beat. best of all that I've tried including the Meile.
faults are cheap front wheel, it seeks out things to bang into, even when your going strait it will veer off and bang into everything. Door frames are all chiped up. accessory lid is flimsy. better off without it all together except the accessories keep falling out ( they wont stay in their molded spot) wish they spent more thought on those details.

Title: Good heater, bad workmanship
Content:
This heater is a great heater, it works nice, quite and heats up the room fairly quickly even on setting level 1. However, I am really disappointed with the quality Delonghi is producing. All the side panels are crooked, none are in their place properly, this is the second one I received and its in bad shape, the first one was even worse. Lately all Delonghi products are falling off the quality benchmark. A couple of weeks ago I bought a Delonghi coffee maker, paid about $100, and the thing does not stand properly (legs are not even.) The same with my Delonghi Griddle, there is a gap on the face plate joint! They should not allow any such products to leave their factories in my opinion for the price they are selling!

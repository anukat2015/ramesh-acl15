Title: This thing is great if you are a tech-lover
Content:
We actually bought our Grind and Brew used and it has been working well for us. It is a little high-maintenance, but fortunately I am one of those people who like high-maintenance appliances. I clean it meticulously every night and it has continued to work beautifully for us. The coffee is not incredible but still good, and it's nice to have fresh beans ground for you. All in all, a good purchase and very convenient for anyone without time to make fresh-ground coffee in the morning.

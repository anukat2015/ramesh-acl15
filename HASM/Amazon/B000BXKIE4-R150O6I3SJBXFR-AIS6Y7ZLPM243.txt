Title: Cleaning Machine!!
Content:
I have been using this machine for a while now and could not be more pleased with its performance. It runs quiet and has a lot of suction. After doing some extensive research on vacuums I decided on this unit. While there were some complaints about reliability, I went ahead and got a refurbished unit. Not only did I save some money, I figured that a repair of a failed componant and a second inspection would be benificial towards a more reliable machine. The vaccum looked like it had hardly been used with one little scratch on it.
    The only thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars was the fact that the power head is about as loud as the last upright I had and not as quiet as the canister. But the power head does clean remarkably well. We have 2 dogs and it gets the dog hair very well. The bags are small but that is just as well since all that nasty dirt does not sit in the vacuum too long. The bags are cheap and changing them is an easy task that takes just seconds. 
   I would recommend this vacuum to friends and family...it truly is a great cleaning machine!

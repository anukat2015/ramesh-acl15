Title: Canon XSi great for recreational photos, not a workhorse.
Content:
We received a couple of new Canon XSi Digital rebels for crime scene work. Right out of the box one of them had battery issues. Last night at a homicide scene in sub freezing temps mine completely crashed. The associated speedlight couldn't communicate with the camera resulting in underexposed, blurry night pictures. Then the camera began shutting down intermittently. I had to put it back in the car for several minutes until it began to operate again. Finally, after over an hour of annoying, unannounced shutdowns it started doing what it's supposed to. The pictures it takes are nothing short of spectacular. I love the design and the interface. Overall a great camera. I'm afraid, however I will have to stick with my erstwhile Canon S2is. It may have fewer megapixels and tons of scratches and scars but it always turns on and takes pictures no matter what. Canon makes great cameras. They dropped the ball on these.

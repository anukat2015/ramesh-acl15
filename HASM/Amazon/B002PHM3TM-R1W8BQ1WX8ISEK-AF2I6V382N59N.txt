Title: ASUS quality for Dell prices
Content:
This laptop was literally a steal at the price they were offering it for. It's a shame that it's no longer in stock, as I would have loved to purchase a second one for myself.
The performance is stellar for the price, the battery life is good, and the laptop was cool to the touch. Although it shipped with Premium, it came with a card that let me request a copy of Windows 7 for free, which I did. I received the copy of Windows 7 and painlessly upgraded to the new OS.
The laptop also comes with the ExpressGate feature, which I don't necessarily use, as I've never been in a situation where an extra 15 seconds to boot into Windows is a pain, but I could see why some people would be interested in such a feature.
The ASUS build quality is absolutely stellar, and the design is great.

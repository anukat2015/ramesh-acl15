Title: Horrible item, horrible seller
Content:
I bought this early for winter, didn't need to use until two weeks after purchase.  It worked great the first four nites then stopped. Now it won't turn on.  I called the seller on day 30 after the ORDER date (not ship date, not received date) asking for an exchange or refund.  The rep clucked on the phone about it being thirty days, took my info and promised a call back.  A week later, no call back.  I can't get through on DeLonghi's number, I'm put straight into a hold queue and after half an hour I hang up.  This item is definitely not worth the money, and Polstein's is an equally unreliable seller with zero customer service.

Title: perfect solution
Content:
In our low-humidity summer weather, this device is just what was required. It cools the air--not like an air conditioner but enough to make a nice difference. The fan is quiet and not at all irritating, yet it is powerful enough to make a difference across the room. It's nice and compact; doesn't get in the way when it's not in use. Our summers (Western Oregon) are pretty mild, so this might be of limited usefulness in other climates, but for us this meets the need very nicely.

Title: Love the Breville BKC700XL Coffeemaker
Content:
Purchased the Breville BKC700XL after reading several great reviews. I was planning to buy the Keurig maker until I read other reviews listing a few problems with those. I purchased it for my husband's birthday because he has wanted a single serve maker for quite a while and I had held him off due to the cost of the maker and the k-cups. I think I like it more than he does. It is very simple to use and is made very well. I like the cup sizes and can brew a cup in my tall travel mug to take on the way to work. It comes with a reusable filter cup that stores in the coffeemaker so you can use regular coffee in it as well. I  haven't found any drawbacks thus far other than it is a bit expensive. I would recommend this product to a friend.

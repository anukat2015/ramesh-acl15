Title: pet hair vac
Content:
The Bissel 3920 performs as advertised and does a good job of cleaning up animal hair. (cats in this case) The two hand vacs that are part of the package are handy and do the hair job on pillows and similar items. The vac is a bit on the heavy side and will give your arms a workout pushing it. A good value for the money.Bissell 3920 Pet Hair Eraser Dual-Cyclonic Upright Vacuum Cleaner

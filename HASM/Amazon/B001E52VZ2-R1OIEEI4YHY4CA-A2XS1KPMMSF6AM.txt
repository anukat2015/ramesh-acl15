Title: Great!

This tiny vacuum is the best.  I volunteer my time cleaning at a cat rescue.  I run this vac almost two hours straight cleaning cement basement floors, and carpeted cat perches/furniture. The machine can get hot, but it still has a powerful suction to a concrete floor with the vac head attachment. Even with a overly full bag it still has suction and the cord is long.  I just wish the bags were larger though, as they fill up fast with cat hair and litter.  :) I do not suffer from elbow fatique considering how long I am using the machine.  The only issue I had was when a tiny cat toy got caught in the plastic pipe at the connection to the corrigated hose.  This happens quite often and the person who owns the vac fixed it by disconnecting those pieces.  This vacuum can handle being run hard and still works great.  I purchased one for my mother in law because its so easy to use, carry and to change the bags.  I think this Eureka Mighty Mite vac is better then the expensive mini Riccar I own.

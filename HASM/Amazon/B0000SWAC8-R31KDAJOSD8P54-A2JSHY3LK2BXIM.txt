Title: Better little vacuum than many people claimed
Content:
Before this purchase, I had a canister Electrolux for years.  Bought it at a garage sale for $100 and it lasted forever.  I debated whether or not to give the new Electrolux maker a try. And, I couldn't decide which reviews to believe, the bad ones or good ones.  After looking at the reviews and features of other vacuums, I decided to go for it.  I've only used it a few times, but it is great.  Edge feature is nice and it has lots of power; sucks up all the dirt and more.  It is easy to use and my house cleaner loved it compared to the old one.  As any canister, it has its mobility issues, but not like some people claimed (they probably never had a canister vac).  The head was a tiny bit higher than my old one, but it still fit nicely under things.  The attachments seem fine and store easily.  My only complaint was the cord from the head to the upright handle.  It crosses the foot pedal, and so you have to be careful not to step on it while depressing the pedal to lower the handle.  Not really a big deal though.  This vacuum has some features just like cars do that some people may prefer over others, but in terms of its main function....works great.  Definitely not sorry I bought it.

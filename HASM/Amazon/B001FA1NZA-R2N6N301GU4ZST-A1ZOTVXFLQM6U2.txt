Title: Best runners Ipod ever! Until you start sweating!!
Content:
Been running with the new shuffle this week and all I can say is this is my favorite of the 3 ipod shuffles. The 2nd gen shuffle weighed enough that when clipped to the bottom of my shirt it would bang against my leg when I ran. This new one is so light my shirt always laid flat, no bounce. Also with the 2nd gen it always took a few seconds to figure which way it was clipped on to make a change in vol. This new one is so easy to change vol while on the run.  So if you are like me and want a player that holds lots of music, easy to adjust while running and so light it never bounces, then this one is for you. 
 
Update after running with this shuffle for a while and getting sweat on the controls they have stopped working as everyone else has mentioned. This shuffle is useless for running unless you dont ever sweat.

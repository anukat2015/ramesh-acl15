Title: Don't buy a vacuum because you like the color.
Content:
This vacuum actually qualifies as the second worst purchase I have ever made (I own a VW).  It's hard to know where to start.  I vacuumed the house one time before the entire thing was clogged.  I had to spend over an hour taking everything apart to clean it, as well as using a BBQ skewer to poke carpet fuzz through and out of the hose.  Fortunately, the canister was still empty but that was probably because nothing actually made it through the hoses.  This is something I have to do about every other time I use it.  The vacuum is so heavy I have to stretch before taking it up a flight of stairs.  It is so loud I feel I should probably wear protective earwear when using it.  My three year old, who used to ride on our old canister vac (R.I.P.) is so afraid of this noisy green monster that he cowers in a corner, rocking himself and weeping.  I also find for all that noise, it doesn't really do anything.  Rather than pick up things like carpet fuzz and hair, it condenses it, rolling it up into long fuzz dogs that I must later pick up by hand.  IF it happens to pick up something larger than a lentil bean, the vacuum assumes the role of pellet gun.  Long pants are recommended.  The only feature I like in this vacuum is its automatic shutoff.  The manual doesn't say anything about this, but it's clever.  After a couple rooms, it shuts off, and for one more day I am spared the pain of using this travesty of design and engineering.  Take a lesson from my son and stay away from this one (rocking and weeping optional).

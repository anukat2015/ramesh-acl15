Title: Works for me
Content:
Reading so many negative reviews, I felt I had to put my two cents in. I have had this coffee maker for 3 or 4 years, using it every day, and I have never had a single issue with it. It doesn't leak, it doesn't overflow and it makes hot, strong coffee that stays at a drinkable temperature for several hours. I love coffee. I will make the 10 cup pot and drink it all. I have always ground my own beans and the grinding feature is much easier to use than many separate grinders that require you to stand there and hold the button down for however long it takes to grind. This coffee maker is no louder than any of the other grinders I have had, and it is MUCH easier to clean. I just take all the pieces out and pop them in the dishwasher, and in 90 minutes those pieces are spotless. The only times I have had trouble pouring the coffee is when I don't have the lid on straight, so that's just operator error.  
Overall, I think this is a quality machine. It does exactly what it is supposed to do well. It stands up to  a lot of use, and a bit of a beating... I tend to be rough on things and it still looks brand new. This is a good coffee maker, and eventually, when it's time to replace it I will be buying another Cuisinart.

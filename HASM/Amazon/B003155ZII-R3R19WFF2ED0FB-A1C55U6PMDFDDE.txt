Title: Very Good Deal
Content:
I needed a PC that could handle all of my basic computer needs and be able to also handle my multimedia needs.  The PC has fantastic features.  4 USB inputs, an i5 core processor, HDMI & VGA connections and a full keyboard.  The laptop is great.  It is a bit bulky and since it only has a 720p resolution I cannot fully utilize the full screen of my 1080p HDTV.  These features are the only reason that I did not give this laptop a 5 star rating.

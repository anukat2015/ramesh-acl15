Title: My first Mac and it's Pro
Content:
I have always used, but after purchasing iPod, I got familiar a little bit about what's this Mac-omania is about. So, I bought new MacBook Pro. 
It's almost perfect, but I have one problem with this laptop. I cannot synchronize your Hotmail and Yahoo accounts with iMail. Does anyone know how to do that?

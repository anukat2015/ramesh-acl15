Title: For a Newbie, It's Worth Every Penny!
Content:
I agonized for months about getting this camera, the Rebel XSi or just getting another point and shoot.  I have never used a DSLR and was afraid that it would be too complicated.  However, I can honestly say purchasing this camera was the best decision I've made.    After doing some research, the XSi was not very different from the XS.  In past reviews a lot people said get the XSi but at the time, the price difference was nominal.  Now that the XSi is about $150 more than the XS, purchasing the XS was a reasonable choice.  I highly recommend this camera if you are new to DSLR.

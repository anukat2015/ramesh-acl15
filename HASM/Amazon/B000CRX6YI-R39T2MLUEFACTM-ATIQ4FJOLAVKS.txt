Title: Professional
Content:
This is one professional camera at an amazing price. I use this exclusively for professional portrait and wedding photography. The only thing negative I would say is it eats battery life, even without "chimping". But thats to be expected I suppose from such a high performer such as the D200. All of the automatic features are flawless, and when you want to add your own personal touch, just switch to M mode and set everything manually for some amazing effects. I highly recommend this camera to the amateur and professional alike. You will not be disappointed at all, in fact, you wont be able to put it down.

Title: It works in Minnesota
Content:
I bought 3 for different rooms basically as additional sources for warmth when needed. They replaced the older oil filled heaters I'd had for years. In the morning they get turned off (if we remember), towards evening they get turned back on for the quick warmup then lowered to the 750 Watt, which we set at 3 or sometimes 2.I have kept the boxes for summer storage.
 Prior to these I bought several towers from a different Mfg and never even got them set up. After much fumbling, throwing of tools and thinking I was having chest pains I decided to return them and start research, not price shopping. I was at the point of choosing between the possibility of freezing to death or going out in a straight jacket. Then the 3 units showed up and I thought parts were missing. It took longer to take them out of the box and get the plastic off than it did to assemble them.
I have not been able to figure out the electric costs yet, although my first bill using these was 30.00 cheaper than the oil. However there was a rate increase in the other bill and a period of very cold temps where these units might of had to have been set higher. Now I,m looking for a larger unit to maybe hang at the lake cabin and replace the vintage , original propane heater that is up there now.
Do your shopping, compare, and throw out the "Best I ever have seen" along with the "Worst I ever have seen" and read normal reports. I gave it 4 stars because I've only had them for 7 weeks....hopefully when they come out of the box again next winter  they will continue to work as well as they have this one.
For the record, this is the first time I have ever written a product review of any kind.

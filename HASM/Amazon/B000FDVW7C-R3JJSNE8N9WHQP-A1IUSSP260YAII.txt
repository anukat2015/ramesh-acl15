Title: Do not buy it !
Content:
I bought a US Stove 5500M Ashley to save money with heating. It burns one bag a day ($7.00) but it is not even close as potent as advertised. It is advertised to heat up from 1,200/1,500 sq ft, but it heats up to 500 sq ft, if that much.
     It is very noise, too. One can't watch TV or talk on the phone, or even have a conversation in the room where the stove is.
     Worst of all the warranty for electrical parts is for one year only, and those parts seem to be produced to last just a little longer than the warranty. I bought this stove last fall, one month after the warranty expired the igniter has melted. I have to spend U$50,00 to buy a new one. Luckily, I am skillful enough to fix the stove myself. Otherwise, I would have to pay U$200,00 plus parts for a technician to fix it.
    If you are still thinking about buying it. Buy it in a place that allow returns (in case you can put up with the noise), and buy extended warranty (because, most likely, it is going to break right after one year).

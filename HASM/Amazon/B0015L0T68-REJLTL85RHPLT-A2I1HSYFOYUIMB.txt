Title: When it works, it's great
Content:
I got this to replace another Sansa player that was stolen and discontinued. I need a rechargeable battery because I use my play 8 - 10 hours a day at work.  The sound is great but the joystick took some getting used to. All went well for about 2 months.  Then, in the middle of a song, it died.  After a couple of days in a drawer, I connected it to the computer and it came back on.  All went well for about 3 weeks.  Then, it died and came back again. All went well for another 3 weeks.  Again with the sudden death.  This last time, it ran for a day and a half.  It is now in the drawer.  I won't get another Fuze and am shopping for a reliable player.

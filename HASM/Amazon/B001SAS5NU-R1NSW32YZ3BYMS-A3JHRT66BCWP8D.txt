Title: Indeed a quality vacuum but not sure it's worth the price
Content:
Decided to splurge a little and get a Dyson and it definitely lives up to the ads. However I kind of think that I may have been able to get the same performance from a cheaper vacuum. If you can afford this vac, by all means go for it. But if it is a little out of your price range then get a cheaper one, you won't be missing anything that special

Title: Works Pretty Well
Content:
I bought this unit mostly because of cooling capacity and being able to get it in one day by Amazon Prime shipping.  I was very wary about this unit from the other reviewer's concerns, but doing more research (Home depot's web site has this model as well), noted that most people's concerns were around the rather limited overflow tank capacity for water that the unit can't evaporate into its exhaust.
That said, we've run this unit all day in 90-95F heat (a rarity in the Pacific NW) with about 50% relative humidity in our upstairs bedroom which is about 470 sqft.  It worked well enough and got the temperature down to 73-75F within a few hours.  I think this unit would excel in smaller rooms (200-300 sqft.).  Due to our moderate humidity, we've not experienced the tank problems--if you live in humid environments, I don't think this unit is for you.
Outside of that, this unit is a bit heavy, so it is "portable" in the sense that a 80lbs. suitcase with no handles and wheels is portable.  And it is not quiet by any stretch of the word, but when I'm hot, it's all about the cooling.
I would recommend this unit for people with rooms smaller than 400 sqft. and not dealing with high humidity--my room was a little too big for it (not the unit's fault--I should've overestimated for a portable), but it still managed to keep us comfortable.

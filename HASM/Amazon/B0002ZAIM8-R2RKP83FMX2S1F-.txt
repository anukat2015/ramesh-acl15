Title: ok...not worth it
Content:
I bought an iPod shuffle a summer ago, and loved it at first until all my friends laughed at me for buying an iPod without a screen.  All of them had nanos.  I felt left out.  I am now going to buy another mp3 player.  I have to admit I will still use it for exercising it is a great work out tool.  Over all I don't think it's woth it buy a nano.  A nano is just a little more money.

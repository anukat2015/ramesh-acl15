Title: This is my 3rd Rebel...
Content:
This is the third Canon rebel that I have owned in the past 10 years, I started in the pre-digital age with a film version.  I really love this camera, it works for everything I need it to do.  I am taking a photography class and this thing does all the 'tricks' needed to complete assignments, but it is also my go-to camera to use as a point and shoot with the premade settings.  I like that the screen on the back is larger than my older Rebel, much easier to take a peek at what I've got.  I have had no problems at all with programming or using this camera.  Until I have finished photography school and actually open my own business and get a large frame camera, like a 5D, I will be sticking with the Rebel.

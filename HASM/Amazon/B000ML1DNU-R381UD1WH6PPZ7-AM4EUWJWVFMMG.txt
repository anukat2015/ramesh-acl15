Title: Fantastic vacuum
Content:
I own an earlier version of it, can't remember how long ago it was, it's been so long, five to ten years? It still works great but i'm giving to my son to use in his rec room/basement and I'm buying another one. I have mostly Pergo floors and haven't had any issues. I can only get the bags at Sears locally so I usually buy a bunch at a time.

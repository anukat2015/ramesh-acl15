Title: want to sue Consumer Reports for lying about this one
Content:
I bought my original BD2500 about 18 months ago. It made great tasting coffee but soon over-flowed. This caused the unit's digital system (placed at the base of the unit) to go haywire - hence, no more coffee maker. The machine was three-months-old!
I went to 'Consumer's' to find a new coffee maker. They recomended the B&D 2500!! Well, I thought, it did make great tasting coffee, and maybe the overflow problem was just a fluke, so I bought another B&D 2500. Same thing happened!!! This time I called B&D. They said that for five dollars they would send me a new one. They sent a lesser model. When I complained they actually told me they didn't make the 2500 anymore! (Lie right?) Well this new B&D had the exact same problem! I never called them. wasn't giving them another five dollars for trash. So, three B&Ds later, I am now using an old pot and searching for a new one - with the digitals on the side or top - in case all new pots have an overflow problem. Dont' buy this coffee maker!!!

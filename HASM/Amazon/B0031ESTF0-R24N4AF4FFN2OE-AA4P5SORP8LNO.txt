Title: Perfect for my needs
Content:
I wanted a light laptop that was faster and provided more options than a netbook.  I've had this laptop for over two weeks now and already took it on a trip with me.  I have read all the reviews of this laptop on Amazon and other sites as well as reviews of similar Toshiba Satellite laptops.  I was prepared for some of the problems I have read about but experienced none.  The low volume problem that many mentioned is easily fixed by going into the sound settings and making adjustments there.  I had no problem using the keyboard or the mousepad.  I don't know why some others had complaints.  The "fingerprint magnet" issue that is widely mentioned was not as bad as I had expected.  So I am satisfied with my new laptop and find that it meets my needs.

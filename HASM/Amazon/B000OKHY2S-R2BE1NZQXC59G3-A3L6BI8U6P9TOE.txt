Title: Good value, ok cooling
Content:
I purchased this cooler hoping that it would do it's job because I live in an extremely dry climate. I was a bit disappointed that it took a long time and didn't smell good. It lowered the temp 4 degrees at 25% humidity. However, they're not joking when they say it costs less to operate than a 60-watt lightbulb. Also, the air it blew out was icy when I had it set on the slowest fan setting. The problem is that the low fan speed is really slow. There is also a high and medium settings, although high isn't very cool. In the end I just settled for medium. 
All in all this product is a great value but the cooling isn't so great.

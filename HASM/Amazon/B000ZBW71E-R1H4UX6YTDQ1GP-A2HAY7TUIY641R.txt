Title: Excellent laptop
Content:
Exellent laptop with a dedicated graphics card, twin drives and plenty of memory. I have loaded this laptop up for use with my job, and yet it is an excellent gamer for downtime during business trips.
Plenty of features, full size keyboard with a separate numeric pad. 
I highly recommend it.

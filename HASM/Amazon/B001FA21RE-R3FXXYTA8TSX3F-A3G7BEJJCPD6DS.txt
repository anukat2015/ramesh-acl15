Title: Fun Gadget to Have Around
Content:
The Nescafe Dolce Gusto machine is my first experience with a single serve gourmet coffee maker, and I'm a bit undecided as to how I feel about it. 
Here are the positives:
- The coffee was of high quality, much better than from a standard coffee maker, but not quite as good as from a coffee shop
- I thought the dry milk would taste strange, but actually could not tell that it was not real milk once it was in the coffee
- The design of the machine is very innovative, and definitely adds a nice touch to the kitchen
- Easy set-up, the instructions were great
- As promised, the machine is very easy to clean and there's virtually no mess because of the neat capsules
- Coffee is ready very quickly, I believe it took 20-30 seconds - and the froth was unbelievable!
- Easy to control the amount of milk and coffee according to your taste
- The water is not pre-heated, but passed over a heating element when you switch the machine on
- The machine comes with a starter pack of coffee, a saucer with a cup, and a glass, which were nice touches
- Nutrition wise, these coffees are not too terrible; if you do Weight Watchers, I believe a cappuccino (which comes with milk) is 2 points
Cons:
- The coffee pods are expensive compared to your basic coffee, and surprise surprise, you can only use Nescafe pods with this machine. With the milk + coffee pods, you're paying slightly above $1 per cup. The espresso and caffe lungo that do not use milk are cheaper.
- There are not that many varieties of coffee yet, but I guess they're coming out with more in the near future. I believe caffe lungo is the only variety that comes in decaffeinated and mild versions, and cappuccino comes in a cold drink as well.
- The machine does not have a water filter, which would have been nice considering the price.
- While you can control coffee and milk amounts, the pods come pre-made with sugar, which you cannot control
- It can take some fine tuning to get the coffee just right. A couple of times I wound up with drinks that were watery or too strong
Overall, I think it's a nice gadget to have around. I will use it in addition to my regular coffee machine as a special treat, but it's too expensive for an everyday habit.

Title: AWESOME CAMERA!
Content:
I got this camera for Christmas and it is AWESOME!  The pictures are amazing. I have owned other Pentax cameras and have always liked their products.  My husband bought me the K10D and I am blown away with the quality of pictures it produces.  It has so many options available that I have a lot of things to learn.  But within a few minutes after opening the package I was taking pictures.  You don't have to be a Rocket Scientist to be able to use this camera.  You can't go wrong for buying this camera.  GO FOR IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!

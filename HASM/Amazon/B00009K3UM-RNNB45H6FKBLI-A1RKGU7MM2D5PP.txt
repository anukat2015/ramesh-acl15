Title: Great coffee pot/machine
Content:
We bought it, to use on our boat.
It has a small footprint, for a 12 cup.
The coffee is great, and I like all the little adjustments, to make it your way.
It is one of the first, when you pour it, does not make a mess all over.
You can even set it, to how long, you would like the pot heater, to stay one.
A great coffee machine.

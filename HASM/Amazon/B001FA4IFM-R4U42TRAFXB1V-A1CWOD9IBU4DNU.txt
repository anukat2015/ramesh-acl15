Title: Best heater I've ever owned
Content:
This heater works great.  Extremely quiet and puts out an incredible amount heat for its size.  I did a lot of research before purchasing and am very happy with this heater.  Safe, quiet, and will heat a room in very little time.  The only thing I could think of to make a good product better would be the digital heat settings.  They are adjustable in 5 degree increments, which seem to be accurate in terms of actual temp, but it would be nice to have the option of setting it for each degree in between.  I always set the thermostat to 70 and let the heater do its thing.  Very pleased with its performance.

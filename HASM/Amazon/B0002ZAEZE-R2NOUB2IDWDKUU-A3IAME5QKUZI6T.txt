Title: Mean Green  Rocks this iPod mini is so hot
Content:
The iPod Mini in Green is so hooooot seriously I wanted to buy the mini ever since it first came out (iPod Mini fist generation) but I thought the colors sucked man they sucked they looked bland and washed out and they cost way too much plus at the time I had the regular ipod third gneration. My ipod broke down and so I decided to go mini this time the colors are kicked up a whole lot really bright and matching click wheel icons and the mini now has a whole lot more battery life and plus you get 6 gigs for 250 dollars instead of the four gigs the first generation had then there is the feature you pull the headphones out the mini pauses the song  im so glad i waited for generation 2 and the green ipod mini is sick people are always staring at it because blue and silver are very popular for dudes but me i like to be differnt great investment

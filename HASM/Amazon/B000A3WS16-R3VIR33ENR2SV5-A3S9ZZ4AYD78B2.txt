Title: 30Gb Ipod Black
Content:
First of all id like to thanks many of you for your reviews on the battery life, i though it was only me, being new to the ipod.
Yeah its sad that it doesnt last long for video playback but you have to admit that the EQ options it offers optimize the sons from good to MAGNIFICENT, I have never heard songs as realistic as the ipod does.
And I do belieave I read an article ovr at ipodmine for 50Hr ipod batteries...so theres something to get your hopes up...

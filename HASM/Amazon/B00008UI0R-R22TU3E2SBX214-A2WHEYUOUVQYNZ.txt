Title: Excellent at first, but a few problems over long haul.
Content:
We have had this unit for approx. 2 years.  It was fantastic at first.  Incredible suction.  In the last six months it has begun to fail structurally.  Plastic connection pieces have started breaking and they are difficult to get.  If you are looking for a long term vacuum, go with a higher end.  If you just need something for two years or less ... this is perfect!!!  You cannot beat the suction power!!!  Only suggestion is to buy an extra filter because you always need to wash the old one at the wrong time.

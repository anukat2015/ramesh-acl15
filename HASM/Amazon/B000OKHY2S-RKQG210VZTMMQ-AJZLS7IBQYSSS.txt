Title: Refrigerator Carton Cooler
Content:
Save your money.  The only possible cooling you may get from this unit is if you have a refrigerator carton you can get in, (ask your kids) and take this "cooler" with you. This unit would benefit greatly from liquid nitrogen cooling.  Of the two units, only one arrived undamaged.  The unit is fairly quiet, except when the 'SWEEP' is turned on.  Then, it sounds like someone in the room rocking on an old rocking chair.

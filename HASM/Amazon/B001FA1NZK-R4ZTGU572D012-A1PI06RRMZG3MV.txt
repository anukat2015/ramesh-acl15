Title: Bought TOOOOOOO soon
Content:
I purchased this product for my wife and she just loves it!  I normally take the saver method of delivery because most electronic products I have purchased from Amazon have come from their Fernly, NV distribution point which is only 2 1/2 hours from me.  It's a good thing that I chose regular delivery this time, because Amazon has chosen to use the USPS for these kind of shipments (You know, the Snail Mail people) and it took 8 DAYS for the shipment to get to me - - the LONGEST of any product that I have purchased from them!
Now the sad part - - I did not realize that mid-September is when Apple releases NEW products, so now the IPOD Touch (2nd Generation 32GB) that I purchased is NOW worth $95 less, even though it is less than 30-days old in useage.  I could have saved the $95 by delaying my purchase by 3-weeks, but I would have been in trouble for not getting my wife her gift on time for her birthday.

Title: My husband, the coffee lover, has a new girlfriend, and her name is "Bre".
Content:
We like Breville at our house - they make solidly engineered products that are well thought out and creative.  We have the heavy duty juicer, and love how it makes mincemeat of anything we want to juice.
For Christmas this year, we received at our request, the Breville single cup coffee maker.  We had a Capresso coffee maker in the past, and were starting to run into some problems with it.  
Here are some of the great positives thus far:  1.  You can use your own coffee with this machine, and the filtered water makes it taste even more delicious.  2.  No longer do I have to throw out coffee that my husband made thinking he would be able to drink it all - he makes one cup at a time = no waste.   3.  The machine is ready to brew so so so fast.  Basically, if you turn the machine on, stroll into another room for a minute, and stroll back, the machine is ready to brew.
The only negative we've encountered is that there is some splashing onto the back of the machine during the brewing process.  Not a huge deal - we just wipe it up after the coffee is done brewing.
My husband, the coffee lover couldn't be happier, which in turn, makes me a happy girl.  
We love love love the Breville.

Title: Great laptop, fast, good price.
Content:
Bought this for my son who is in college. His last laptop computer was an HP and the hard drive died. We dicided to get him the Toshiba based on recient articles that said the Toshiba was among the most reliable laptops and the HP was near the bottom. (We have since fixed the HP and now mom and dad have a laptop to share.) The Toshiba Satellite L505 is just what our son needs with the speed to view videos without stuttering and edit audio he is recording. He is happy. We are happy because it was affordable.

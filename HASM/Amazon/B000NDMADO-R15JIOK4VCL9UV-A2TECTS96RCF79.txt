Title: OK but has some flaws
Content:
I do not own this model but a very similar one. 
My cons are:
1. This vacuum is very heavy compared to others.
2. The clip at the back to hold an attachment (or the wand when you are vacuuming and want to move something before continuing) is weak. I have given up on trying to put the wand there when I need to move a piece of furniture or something off of the floor because it falls over every time and I don't want to collapse the wand to clip it while I move something then have to extend the wand again.
3. The extendable wand can be tricky if not locked into place. (This is why I do not collapse it until I am done.)
4. For whatever reason, when changing between the carpet tool and hardfloor tool, I manage to pinch some skin on my hand or finger every time.
5. When you are done and you wind the hose around the vacuum (as shown on the picture here) the clip to hold the wand into place isn't good and so the wand may slip out while you are carrying it if you bump the hose.
Pros:
1. I like the bagless.
2. Very good at picking up pet hair.
3. The air that comes out of it IS clean and does not have that vacuum cleaner smell.
For me, the cons outweigh the pros. I had a Miele before and I am considering going back to Miele. It is a bit disheartening to spend all of this money on a vacuum and then it has so many flaws. If you are considering this vacuum, please go somewhere where you can try it first and try collapsing and extending the wand, putting the wand in the clips, and so on. And be sure you can deal with the weight.

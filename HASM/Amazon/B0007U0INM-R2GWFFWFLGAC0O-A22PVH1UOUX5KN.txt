Title: additional takes
Content:
this is a great digital music player, a lot of good and bad things have been covered by other reviews, so I'll just point out a few items that were not mentioned:
Pros:
- the optional remote thingy that's included.  a very convinient piece of add-on that should come standard in all music players.
Cons:
- album art is supported only using Toshiba's gigabeat room software, I have yet to find a way to make the album cover show up in the player using other woftwares to transfer.
- unicode doesn't display right all the time.  I have a lot of songs with Chinese titles, some words (I would say close to 5%) failed to convert, and only show up as "?" on screen.

Title: Good coffee maker
Content:
I've owned this coffee maker for about a year, brewing once/week. I generally agree with the positive reviews.
I too use #4 filters. To make them fit the #3 basket, I make a fold on the bottom of the filter, then another fold on one side, and it fits OK (but not perfectly) and is useable.
The only problem I've encountered is that occasionally the floating water-level indicator sometimes gets stuck at the bottom of the water-level tube as I pour water into the maker. A gentle tap on the side usually knocks it free.

Title: Lots of Extra's Coffee Maker
Content:
I am so pleased with our new coffee maker!  It's fast, makes piping hot coffee, and has little extra features that I really like.  It beeps when your coffee has finished brewing.  It has a light that lets you know when the machine needs cleaning and has a cleaning cycle. It has many other helpful features.  The instructions were easy to read and follow and I've had no problem filling the resivoir with water from the pot.  The pot is dripless and I'm also able to use my old coffee filters with it.  Plus the pink color goes great in my kithen.
I'd highly recommend this coffee maker.  Enjoy.....

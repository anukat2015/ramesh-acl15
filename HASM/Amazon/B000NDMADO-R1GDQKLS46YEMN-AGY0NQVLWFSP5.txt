Title: Dyson DC 21 Stowaway Canister Vacuum
Content:
I was very disappointed in this very expensive vacuum.  I had a Kenmore Canister Vacuum for 6 years and it broke.  After trying out this Dyson Canister Vacuum for 2 months and finally decided to return it.  It is heavy.  The handle is cheaply made and very hard to extend.  You have to pull it very hard to get it to click.  Many times, I pulled it so hard that I thought I was going to break it and yet it still didn't click.  It was very frustrating.  The cord is very short, which also very frustrating to have to plug and unplug before you can finish a room.  The dust bin is also very small.  I have to empty the bin at the end of each vacuum and sometimes it looks like I need to empty it before I finish vacuuming the rest of the house.  We only have a two bedroom house, 1200 square footage.  If you have a bigger house with wall to wall carpeting, you will definitely have to empty the bin more often.   It is also annoying that the on/off button is on the canister and not on the handle.  Whenever you need to stop the vacuum to move furniture or toys around, you will need to turn around and reached over the canister to turn it off.  Maybe I was used to the Kenmore model and the eased of the on/off button at the tip of my finger.  The suction was good at the beginning, but after a month of use, it did lose some suction.  I was able to return the vacuum and went to buy another Kenmore canister, which I should have done in the first place.  It would have save me a lot of time and hassel.

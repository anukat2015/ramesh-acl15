Title: Faster flash photos than Nikon D40X
Content:
If you are looking for a camera to take a lot of indoor photos with flash (of your young children like we do), the Canon is much faster with flash photos than the Nikon. My mother-in-law has the older, 7 megapixel Canon, which takes awesome photos. We went to the store to get the newer Canon, but ended up taking home the Nikon since we were told the menus were easier, the glass of the standard lenses was better, and it came with more free stuff. We compared it to mother-in-law's camera over the holiday, and the Canon was much faster. We have since exchange our Nikon for the Canon XTI, and see a huge difference in the speed you can take flash photos. Luckily, we did this in time for the photos of Santa's gifts on Christmas morning. :)

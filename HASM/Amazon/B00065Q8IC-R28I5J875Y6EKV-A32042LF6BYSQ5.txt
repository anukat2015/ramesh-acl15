Title: Fast, solid, reliable, quality performance.

I've gone digital!  If I could sum this camera up into one phrase it would be "Instant gratification."  
I hated digital cameras that made you wait, after turning them on, and between shots.  There are to many shots that have to happen NOW or you lose the shot. You know what I mean... Film was a better choice. You don't have to "boot up" film to take a shot...  
Now when I first got this camera. I tried to measure how long it would take before I could take a shot after I turned it on... As far as I can tell, there is NO DELAY!  As fast as I turn it on is as fast as I can take a shot!  Add 5 frames per-second for 20+ frames and I'm very happy.  The cool thing is you can also do the 5 frames per-second burst in any of the automatic modes, where focus and exposure is reset for each frame.  No worries about wasting film. There is no film, and you can review your results immediatly.  The images I get are top notch, with amazingly low noise(grain) in the higher ISO settings. It's hard to see any noise even at ISO-1600 . Combine this kit with a great computer app like Adobe LightRoom and you have the beginings of photography heaven.

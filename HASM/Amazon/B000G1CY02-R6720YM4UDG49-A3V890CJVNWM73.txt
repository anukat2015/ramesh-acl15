Title: Happy to be warmer!
Content:
I was drawn to the DeLonghi mica panel heater because of its looks, and then I read a lot of positive reviews. Happy to say I have not been disappointed! While no space heater can fully compensate for the poorly designed heating system in my condo, the living room is now a more comfortable place to hang out, thanks to this heater. It operates totally silently (no fan), throws out excellent warmth, and the thermostat regulates the output well. The Amazon price was the best I found. After a month of putting it to the test during this bitter New England winter, I'd say it was well worth the investment. The first time you turn it on, there is a chemical smell that needs to burn off, which is accurately described in the manual. But don't let this discourage you; the next time I used it, no odor. Very pleased with this product. DeLonghi HHP1500 Safeheat Mica-Panel Heater

Title: Good product but...
Content:
I get it after a long time looking for around 10" inches but I'm giving it 3 star because of: 
1- I really don't know why acer put bluetooth button in the notebook when actually it has not included in the notebook???!!! I am using external bluetooth now but this button does not works to turning it of or on! Again I don't know why they put this button?
2- In the "Amazon's Product Description" you see "2 GB of installed DDR3 RAM" but actually its not DDR3, its DDR2! Based on this important mistake of Amazone I bought 4GB DDR3 ram from Amazon in addition to notebook but after arriving and opening ram part of notebook to put the new ram I found this notebook have DDR2 ram not DDR3! I have to contact to Amazon to correct this fault and return new DDR3 ram to them back.

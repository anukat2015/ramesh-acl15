Title: Very good vacuum
Content:
Electrolux always made great, long-lasting vacuum cleaners.  This is my second - the first being an upright that I still have (15 years).  I hope this one lasts half as long (although it's no longer the same company - it's now owned by Eureka).  So far, so good (I've had it about six months).  It's very good on bare floors and rugs.  Great suction, easy to empty and you always know when it's full.  An upright is a little easier to use, but this one is easier when it comes to getting under furniture and when using the attachments. It's nice not to have to buy vacuum cleaner bags.  It's cute looking - somewhat like R2D2 ;-).  Love the retracting power cord.
My only complaints:  Too expensive (but if it lasts as long as my first Electrolux I will take that back).  Other reviewers have said it's lightweight - I find it a bit heavy, but it is easy to pick up becase it has a nice handle.  The other complaint is the same as what others have said about only being able to twist it to one side.  That is more annoying than I thought it would be.  Of my complaints, that one is the top.

Title: LOVE MY NEW EDEN PURE 1000 QUARTZ INFRARED HEATER
Content:
I JUST BOUGHT AN EDEN PURE 1000 QUARTZ INFRARED HEATER, SIMILAR TO THE SO-CALLED AMISH HEATERS, WHICH MY NEIGHBOR AND FRIENDS ALL LOVE.
 MY EDENPURE HAS A 30 DAY RETURN POLICY, AND IS SOLD BY A LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR WHO WILL FIX ANYTHING FOR THE NEXT 3  YEARS.  EVERYONE I TOLD ABOUT IT ALREADY HAD ONE AND LOVED THEM!  MY HOUSEKEEPER HAS 2 SISTERS WHO HAVE BOUGHT 2 OR 3 OF THEM THEY LOVE THEM SO MUCH.  I HAVE AN L SHAPED LIVING ROOM DINING ROOM SPACE AND IT SPREADS HEAT ALL AROUND, UNLIKE SPACE HEATERS WHICH ONLY HEAT A FEW FEET.  THE TRICK IS, THE DIRECTIONS SAY TO UNPLUG WHEN NOT IN USE, OTHERWISE, IN THE OFF SETTING, IT RUNS, AND YOU PAY EXTRA  ON YOUR ELECTRIC BILL.  ALSO, I CANNOT RUN MY COMPUTER AT THE SAME TIME--IT BLOWS A FUSE.
    OTHER THAN THAT, THE HEAT IS GREAT, AND IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE TIME, 30 MINUTES OR SO TO WARM UP THE ROOM, BUT IT IS ALOT BETTER THAN OUTDOOR WOOD BOILERS, THAT COST $10,000 DOLLARS AND CAUSE LUNG CANCER.  WOODSMOKE IS 12 TIMES MORE CANCEROUS THAN CIGARETTE SMOKE.  SEE [...].
   ANYWAY, ANOTHER GUY IN CHURCH TODAY SAID HE ALREADY HAD ONE OF THESE HEATERS AND LOVES IT.  PLUS A FRIEND NEARBY HAS IT IN HER MOTHER'S APARTMENT, AND ANOTHER PERSON I KNOW SAYS IT DOES A GREAT JOB IN HER MOBILE HOME, AND I BELIEVE THOSE ARE NOT WELL INSULATED.  
   ANYWAY, I ALMOST DID NOT BUY ONE OF THESE BECAUSE OF THE LOUSY REVIEWS ON HERE, BUT MY EDENPURE HEATER WORKS GREAT AND I LOVE IT.  I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.

Title: Makes me feel like a pro...
Content:
I decided to comment on my camera since I've just purchased a new lens here and relayed heavily on people's comments. Perhaps I can help someone now...
Ever since I started experimenting with the options and settled on AV mode and Manual - my photography has been appreciated by even more people, including myself. The camera also has automatic modes available that produce great pictures if you don't have time to figure out your options. The quality is always there and options are easy to set - at least the ones a novice such as myself really needs. 
You can enable LCD display for photo taking as well - with a grid (if you choose it)... 
Anyway - what I also love about the camera is the play back option... with a scroll I can quickly review the photos and zoom in to decide on the sharpness, then delete (also easy) right on the spot.
I can't comment on the flash as I generally don't like flash photography and if I need extra light I always bounce it of the ceiling - so I have external flash for those special needs...
 
I found myself to fall for a shallow depth of field (blurry background) so even thus the 28-135mm serves me well - I am getting an 85m 1.8 lens for new opportunities. 
Don't get discouraged if your photos are not sharp all the time - it's really just a function of lenses and light conditions. Pay attention to the light and you will be happy with your outputs:)

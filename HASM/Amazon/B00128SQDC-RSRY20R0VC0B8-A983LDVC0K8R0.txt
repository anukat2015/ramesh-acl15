Title: Great Camera
Content:
I have not used it much yet, about 500 photos, but it is great. Unfortunately I am a novice photographer and I have a lot to learn in order to get the most out of the camera. With that being said it is a relatively easy camera to use, even for a novice. Very happy with the purchase.

Title: Loved it - until it broke
Content:
I got this as a Christmas present in 2007 and I loved it.  I didn't use it very often, maybe a few times a month, but it was very convenient and I had no problems with it.  Recently, I made coffee one day, and the very next day the machine wouldn't turn on.  I tried all the outlets in the kitchen...nothing.  I don't know if something internal burned out or what, but the light won't come on when I push the switch, and it's been dead ever since. I would consider buying another, but I don't want it to die on me in another year!

Title: Not bad, but a little complicated to use.
Content:
We like this heater, but wish it were a bit more powerful, considering how much it cost. Also, the variety of digital displays and options for operating it kind of drives me nuts. I have to look at the manual every time I turn it on. (Usually I just turn it on and take whatever setting I happen to get.:)

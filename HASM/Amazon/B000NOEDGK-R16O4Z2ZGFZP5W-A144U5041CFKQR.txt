Title: Sue me McDonald's, cuz I'm lovin it!
Content:
I just got my D40X Oct 2007. I noticed right away how easy it was to use. The photo's come out with brilliant color. The only thing I have to say about it, is that it doesn't work with my old SLR's (film camera) AF lenses.  It only uses AF-S lenses. I would have gotten a D80 instead, but my camera came with a lens/bag/acessories package I couldn't refuse...also I love that it has RAW format. "I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph, so mamma don't take my Kodachrome away."

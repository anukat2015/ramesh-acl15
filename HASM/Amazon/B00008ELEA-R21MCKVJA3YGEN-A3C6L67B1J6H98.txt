Title: HOT Coffee --- FAST!
Content:
I lost one of the parts to my original Farberware Super Fast percolator, which was about 35 years old.  So, when I saw this great deal on Amazon, I decided to replace the old one.  The new percolator looks almost identical and it does indeed make really great tasting hot coffee "super fast".  The 4 cup size is perfect for those mornings when it's just me who will be drinking coffee.  My only "complaint" is that the inside parts (stem and basket) don't seem quite as sturdy as the ones from my old unit.  Overall, I think it's a very good product and I love the fact that the appearance has remained the same.

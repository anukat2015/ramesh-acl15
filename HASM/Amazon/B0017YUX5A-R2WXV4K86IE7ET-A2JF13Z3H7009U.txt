Title: "Sexiest Vacuum Alive"!
Content:
Hoover has refined their bagged cannister vacuum, and this one tops an $800.00 competitor's I've given up on! The S3670 is a gorgeous lightweight powerhouse with a cord finally long enough to reach more than one room. The wand adjusts quickly and easily; ditto for the release from the Power Nozzle. I'm a petite gal and this vacuum follows me around like a pet poodle- no wrestling the hose to unkink it, either, because there's a 360 degree radius at the hose connection to the cannister. The motor is quieter than others I've owned, but doesn't sacrifice any power. I'm using a low setting for my carpets and am impressed with the results. Storage of the unit requires minimal space also. If this were a man, I'd marry it!

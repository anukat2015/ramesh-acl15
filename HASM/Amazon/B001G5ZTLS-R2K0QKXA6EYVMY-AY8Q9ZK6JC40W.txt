Title: Nikon Guy forced to go to Canon for resolution
Content:
I'm doing a large scale documentation project photographing objects on a copy stand. Was pretty sure I was going to use Nikon bodies as thats what I'm familiar with. I tested several bodies and it came down to a 5d MkII or a D3. I'vee never been a pixel peeper but it was clear that that the added resolution with the 5D made a big difference and it was too ignore. Also it comes with the software you need to tether the camera which is nice. My biggest complaint is the ergonomics, big and clunky. Luckily I don't have to handle too much, because I definitely think Nikons are better in this regard. Also Canon's RAW format is less proprietary than Nikon's which does make a big difference to me.

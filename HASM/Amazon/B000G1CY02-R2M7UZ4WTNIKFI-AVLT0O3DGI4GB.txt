Title: Great heater, no noise, just warmth!
Content:
Great room heater.  Really takes the chill off and doesn't add much
to the electric bill.  Fits perfectly in front of our fireplace. 
Does the job for those times when it's not cold enough to start the fire and you don't really want to turn the thermostat up to heat the whole house.   Would recommend this to anyone.  No odor and no noise, just warmth!

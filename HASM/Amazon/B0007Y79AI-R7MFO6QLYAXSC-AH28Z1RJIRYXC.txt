Title: Best MP3 player in the world!!!!
Content:
I didn't realize why everyone was crazy about the ipod nano until I got it.
it small size is portable and convenient.
it stores 2gb worth of music (500 songs).
I only stored 55 songs so far.
you don't have to carry your cds anymore. everything fits on ipod.
if you think you need more than 500 songs then get ipod nano 4gb, it's only $50 more.
amazon has the best deals on ipods. this is coming from a bargain hunter.

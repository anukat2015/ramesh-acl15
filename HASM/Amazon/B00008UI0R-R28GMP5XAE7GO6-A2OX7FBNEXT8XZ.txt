Title: The vacuum cleaner I've been looking for
Content:
I've had uprights for years and was tired of them not having enough suction.  This bagless canister vacuum has great suction, good tools, is light enough for me(bad back and all), and is easy to manage.  It is also very easy to detach the hose from the motorized floor beater for a quick swipe along the edges. The canister is small so I've gotten into the habit of dumping it after every use.  Everything else makes it worth it!

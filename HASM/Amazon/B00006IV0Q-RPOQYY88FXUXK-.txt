Title: keep looking
Content:
I have owned two PRESO coffee percolators. The first one, stopped heating well after a year of daily use. The second one stopped heating well after three months. There is a weakness with the heating element, and even though this product is reasonably priced and has a ready/on light, I would keep looking.

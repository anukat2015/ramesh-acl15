Title: D40 SLR Kit
Content:
I love this camera. The ease of use, speed and clarity. I had the Nikon 4500 which was a nice camera for the time, but with children, it isn't fast enough  to catch those moments. The D40 from day one has made me glad that I bought it. I take more photos than ever before.
I highly recommend this for someone who wants quality but doesn't want to spend 1K for a high end SLR.

Title: Worked great until motor went bad
Content:
My Electrolux Intensity vacuum worked great until the motor went bad while still under warranty.  Each time I call Electrolux to check on progress of the replacement, I'm told it is back ordered and it will be 6 weeks before I will receive another vacuum. It's been 3 months and I am still waiting. I'd give the vacuum 4 stars for performance and Electrolux customer service a minus number if possible.  I gave the vacuum a rating of 1 star as it hard to be happy about a vacuum that broke under warranty coupled with the problems I am having with Electrolux in getting a replacement.

Title: pretty good
Content:
Pros:
1) This really gets your carpet clean.  It has a lot of suction and gets everything out.  The amount of pet dander that it picks up is simultaneously remarkable and disgusting.  Better in the trash than the carpet.  
2) It sucks up all of the hair from my adult GSD.  That's a lot of hair!
3) The attachment are novel (and "fun," if vacuuming is fun) and useful.  They are thoughtfully designed for the needs of pet owners - they really help get hair out of all of the nooks and crannies it hides.  There are also several extension tools to get up high.  
4) It's self-propelled.  Thats nice for going forwards with it.  
5) It's reasonably priced compared to other vacuums that are made just for pets.  
6) There are two filters, which keeps the pet dander particulates from floating around and settling again.  
7) Its bagless, which is essential if you have a pet who sheds a ton of hair, and would go through a lot of bags otherwise.
Cons:
1) It's kind of heavy.  I'm pretty small, and I get a real workout using this.  It's actually so heavy I can't use it on the stairs and use my old dirt devil for that.  
2) The suction is so strong that it will suck up things that come near the beater.  This may be an adjustment if you're upgrading from a cheap vacuum.  
3) It's pretty big.  This may pose a storage problem if you're limited on space.  
4) The canister is a little small.  It would be nice to be able to vacuum without having to empty it every few minutes.
5) It scares the dog.  But any vacuum does that.  
Overall, I love this vacuum despite its drawbacks.  It's absolutely essential for keeping my house clean with a heavy-shedding dog.

Title: Great heater - doesn't remember it's settings
Content:
I was looking for a SAFE heater for under my desk at home.  This heater seemed to have it all: digital thermostat, hi/lo settings, oscillates, tip-over protection, overheat protection, timer and more...
The only annoying thing is this heater doesn't remember ANY of its settings.  Every time you turn it on you have to set the temperature, hi/low, oscillation... it should just remember these settings.
Overall a great product that I feel safe having running under my desk at home... just one little annoyance.

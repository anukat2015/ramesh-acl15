Title: Need to constantly empty the water reservoir
Content:
Ok this machine works well when it is operating but it shuts off every 45 minutes because the water reservoir gets full. It is tricky to empty it and I am not crazy about dealing with water with a large electrical unit nearby. The drain pan that comes with it only holds about 2 cups of water at a time and the unit is very difficult to empty without spilling. If you have hardwood floors this will not work well for you without an alternative method of draining it. I am using it on carpet but have put the unit on a plastic office type floor mat which helps, but I need to keep a towel nearby when I am draining it. I am in Southern California and the temperature this week has been 85-90 and humid. I did not expect this to be such a pain. Because of the shut off problem I cannot use it at night or to cool the room down before nighttime because I would have to keep emptying it. Supposedly you can use a drain hose but it has to go downhill from the unit - so how are  you supposed to do that? And they don't sell the drain hose as far as I can find out. I am not sure it was worth the expense. It also is very heavy (75lbs) and therefore impossible for me to move from room to room because I have carpet and 2 steps between the upstairs rooms --- forget moving it downstairs!! Think twice on this one. If you live somewhere where you can have a window air conditioner I think that would be a much better, and cheaper, option.

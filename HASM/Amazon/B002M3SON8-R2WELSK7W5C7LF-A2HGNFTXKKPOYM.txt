Title: It is different then the other ipods but I do like it.
Content:
I purchased the new gen shuffle from bb for the gym and brisk walking and so far I do like it. However I don't care for the stock earbuds that came with it and think apple went wrong with this. Because you can't use the shuffle without them so I purchased the adapter from belkin which does help a lot. Because I can use my own earbuds that actually stay in my ears. The voiceover is nice considering my last two shuffles did not have that so you never knew what was coming up next and no playlists.  Other than the earbuds not staying in my ears the player is beatiful and small and is perfect for the gym or walking. I have heard about the sweat getting into the remote and causing havoc but I wouldn't know about that because I don't run so I will never know if its a problem. I currently own a 4th gen Nano and I love it in fact I love both of them. and will continue to use my nano out and about I just find it easier to clip my shuffle to my shirt when I go out walking or at the gym. I only rated it four stars because of the instock earbuds which I don't like. It would have recieved five stars but the earbuds are the reason for that.

Title: great - BUT....
Content:
Pros: keeps coffee hot
      coffee never gets burnt taste
      large carafe size
      timer
Cons: too tall
      tricky lid/basket combo- will create mess if not perfectly lined up
I am an able bodied person with a college degree and I STILL had problems with getting the coffee pot to work properly without coffee spilling out all over.  what a mess!  I got so disgusted I started putting the coffee pot in the sink because I was afraid to use it.  I have now mastered the very touchy lid/ basket alignment and love the coffee pot to death.  But the learning curve was terrible.  I recommend starting with the pot in the sink until you are SURE you know how to set it up properly.

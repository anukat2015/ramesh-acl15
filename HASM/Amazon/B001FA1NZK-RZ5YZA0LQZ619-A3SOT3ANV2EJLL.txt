Title: Awesome, almost...
Content:
I've had this for a few weeks, since I found that ATT would still require the $27US/mo new iPhone data plan... my price point is about $15/mo.  Coming from many years of Palm Treo/Centro, the Touch is really fun.  I'm keeping it!  Hopefully conversion will be easy if I upgrade to iPhone someday...
Pros:
- It didn't take long to get used to the keyboard
- It converted my Rhapsody tunes straight to iTunes (needed to redo playlists, but that's OK)
- I downloaded about 35 free apps, plus some mp3 free audiobooks, podcasts, books, and travel guides.
- WiFi is FAST
- Synchs to Outlook well (altho MS Outlook costs $, but that's a WinCrap issue)
- Good mp3 sound
- Upgrade ($10) synchs Notes (my Palm Tasks, but needed to redo groups)
- iTunes is more user-friendly than Rhapsody
Cons:
- I had to download a Contact app for groups: shame on Apple for not including this!  At least the download app was free.
- The Calendar isn't robust (like Palm's): I need repeat selection for 'the last Wed of the month' or 'the 1st Tues of the month'.
- The Calendar doesn't show colors (per deceptive ads) like Palm does.
- No FM radio
- No Bluetooth (to send phone numbers to my mobile phone)
- Covers (mp3 flipbook) only works with iTunes purchases (deceptive ads!)

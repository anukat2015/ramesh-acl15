Title: Starts off strong, but quickly disappoints
Content:
When I first brought this vacuum home, I thought it was great. It picked up a ton of dirt on the first run and the power paw seemed to do a good job on stairs and upholstery. But after only 2 days, the belt broke, requiring 2 hours on the telephone with Eureka's service department (they did ship a new belt for free). 
It has now been 6  months and the power paw no longer works, the vacuum spits out dirt, and I can't even use the hose attachment because the hose actually releases dust rather than capturing it.

Title: Nice Coffee Maker
Content:
I have been using this coffee maker for two months and like it a lot.  I bought it mainly because it is almost unique in having an adjustable warmer plate, so that you can adjust the warmer plate to how many cups are left.  Very useful.  But easy to forget, as you take cups, and leave it too high.  A white mark on the knob would be nice, so that its position is easier to read/notice.  Other nice features of this product:  1) Two hour automatic shut off with visual indicator of time left.  Sounds corny but actually quite nice.  2) Beep when brewed coffee is ready. 3) Pot pours much better than most.  4) Easy to use.  (I've never tried using the clock stuff.)  5) Good water level indicators.  The only negatives that I've found are that it's fairly tall and might not fit some places, and it looses at least 1/2 cup of water in grounds and left all over the inside of the tank.

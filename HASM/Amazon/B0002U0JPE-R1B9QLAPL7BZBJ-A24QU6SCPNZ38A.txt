Title: Archos Gmini 400
Content:
The Gmini 400 has exceeded my expectations. I needed a digital FM recorder with the capacity to record a minimum of 8 hours on battery power. I record convention talks which are usually less than an hour in duration. I then burn the sessions on CD's. The additional features;(ability to store and view up to 200,000 photos, play games, watch music videos, and download and store data from my PC) are fringe benefits. It was well worth the cost.

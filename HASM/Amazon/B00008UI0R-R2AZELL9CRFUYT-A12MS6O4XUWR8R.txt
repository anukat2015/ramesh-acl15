Title: Great suction-expensive parts
Content:
Love the suction of this vacuum; however, I've had it for three years using it every other day and now i have to replace the hose due to it having a hole where it inserts into the plastic piece that inserts into the canister. This is quite a pricey part and I am currently wondering if I should spend a few extra bucks and just get a brand new vacuum (yes, the part is that pricey). Other than that, I have put it through a lot as I have a BIG house and a large dog as well as a cat and feel it has done well.

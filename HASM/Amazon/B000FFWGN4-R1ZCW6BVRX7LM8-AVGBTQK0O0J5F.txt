Title: great vacuum!
Content:
I have had this vacuum for over a year in a house with wall-to-wall carpet and 3 dogs.  I am always amazed at how much fine-particle dust I empty after I use it.  The bagless situation is great for reducing costs over time, b/c you do not have to keep buying bags.  However, for allergy sufferers, you may want to get a vacuum with a bag so the dust does not fly everywhere when you're emptying it.  (It does have THREE separate dust filters, including a HEPA filter, for when the vacuum is in use, which is great.)  I also love the feature that allows canister of the vacuum to disconnect from the body so you can use it similarly to a hand-vac.  The only thing I have a complaint about is that when you use the hose with the canister still attached to the vacuum body, the entire vacuum body will fall over very easily (and sometimes hit you if you're in the way) if you extend the hose too far.  Other than that, great vacuum.  I'm not sorry I bought it, even after a year of use.

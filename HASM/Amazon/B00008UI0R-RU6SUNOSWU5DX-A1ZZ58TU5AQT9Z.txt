Title: It lives up to the other reviews.
Content:
We have been very happy with this vacuum.  It works great, is easy to use and easy to empty.  Our house had just been vacuumed the day we got this new vac.  My daughter used it to clean her area rug and it sucked up a huge amount of dirt that our old vac left behind!  Love it!!!

Title: Solid Camera - not perfect, but recommended
Content:
I am about 1,000 images into the new 50D.  So far it's been a pleasure.  I am switching from a Nikon D200.  Nikon, to me, has superior ergonomics - the buttons and functions are so well thought out.  Canon works well too but sometimes I feel like I need to be double jointed to change a setting.  I do not like the wheel on top; the silver color is not great and it turns to easily.  I have switched modes in the middle of shooting and not known it.  But, the camera feels solid, the screen is absolutely amazing, the menus are super easy to navigate, the 6 frames per second is impressive.  15 megapixels; well, you only need it if you are printing larger than 20" or so.  I've done 26" prints with a 10 megapixel, and if you know what you are doing and use a great printer it's flawless.  As for low noise - well, it's low, but I'm not blown away.  Remember all your lenses will be 1.6 times their focal length, so it's hard to go wide angle with this camera.  But, it's easy to get super tele photo.  I use it with the 24-105 L lens, which costs almost as much as the camera is worth it.  
This decisions is tricky - it's very solid, I recommend it.  But if I were a first time DSLR buyer right now looking at mid-range cameras, Canon has no advantage over Nikon.  The D90 is terrific and cheaper, the D300 and D700 are amazing.  Why did I switch to Canon?  Simply because I like their lenses better on the high end.  The Nikon 80-400 is slow as a dog, although sharp.  I would much rather have the Canon 100-400 L.  Nikon's high end lenses seem to be a little more expensive, and frankly, there are fewer out there so they are harder to find, new or used.
Good luck, happy shooting, this a great camera.

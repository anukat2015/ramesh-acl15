Title: DVD drive problem
Content:
The first one had a DVD drive problem within a week, so amazon replaced it with another one and so far it seems to be fine. Not sure how it got missed in the HP testing. 
Otherwise, this is a nice laptop; like the touch and feel. Tons of memory, very fast - browsing while writing a DVD is effortless!

Title: No more wasted coffee!!
Content:
I had been researching Keurig for months before I finally decided to order the B60.  I had not so great results with previous pod type coffee makers and found they made a very weak luke warm coffee.  During the week, I am the only one drinking coffee so I hate making a pot to have it sit there and get 'burnt'.  Plus, sometimes I want a cup of coffee in the late afternoon but again, I don't want to make an entire pot for one cup.  
I received my pot and at first it was really loud and leaked some water.  I contacted Keurig who said I had a defective machine (to the person who mentioned that theirs leaks, it shouldn't leak and you should exchange it) so I exchanged it.  Now I have no problems with the machine.  Yes, the pump is alittle loud, but not to the point that others have described it.  Plus, I had a pod type coffee machine a few years ago that was MUCH louder than this.
I have been using the middle cup setting (8oz?) and haven't had any issues of week coffee... but I have been using a stronger dark roast coffee.
All in all I love the machine so far.  Thanks!

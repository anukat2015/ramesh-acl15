Title: Love It!  Making Coffee Was Never So Easy Or Fast.
Content:
The K-cups really speed up making coffee in the morning. They also provide all sorts of options to family and guests. Recently I decided to use my own brand of coffee and fill and dump, a couple of extra steps, but does save money. It isn't really that difficult. When guests are here, I use the other k-cup attachment so guests can just grab their favorite coffee, tea, or hot chocolate and make themselves at home. I don't want them having to empty out coffee grinds. This makes it easy. 
The machine holds enough water so that you aren't constantly having to stop and refill it.
If you are a person who barely knows which end is up when you first wake up in the morning, this machine is for you!  :)
EDITED to say that now I have 2 of these, both working perfectly well. Yesterday I woke up to find that the switch didn't respond. I tried other outlets. I checked the breaker. Nothing worked. I rushed out and bought another one and set it up to find the same problem. I had to hit the RESET button on the outlet. They both work perfectly. 
EDITED STILL AGAIN to say that the old one causes the electrical outlet to cut itself off, so I'm going to have to toss it. The new one appears to be working fine now. The old one had worked for years before having this problem. 
I love the Tully French coffee K-cups. That coffee is rich, dark, and bold. The Emerill's reaches out and grabs you if you like really strong coffee.
I recommend these systems as a practical solution to saving time, effort, and messes while making coffee!

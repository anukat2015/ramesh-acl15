Title: great little machine
Content:
Because I have seven dogs, I desperately needed something effective for all the dust bunnies. I had about given up but decided to try this as it says it was designed for hard wood floors. It is fabulous. Very easy to use and very good at picking up all the pet hair that accumulates in the corners. I use it twice a day, and it does a great job. So glad I don't have to haul out my vacuum anymore. I love it and recommend it to anyone who has hard wood floors and pets.

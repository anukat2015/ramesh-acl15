Title: Constant clogging and overflowing! A real disaster.
Content:
We were very excited when we first purchased this item, and it took quite a long time to get as it was back ordered. There is not much competition for this sized coffeemaker with the thermal carafe. The coffee is good tasting and it stays hot, but the trouble with the clogging and overflowing makes it extremely time-consuming and nervous-making! We have two of these pots and they are both lemons. We tediously clean each part, daily, in order to minimize the overflowing--but it still does flood. I would like to return these, and get my money back if I could! If you value your time and money, I would not buy this product! Cuisinart customer service is also very difficult to reach, and not very helpful or responsive.

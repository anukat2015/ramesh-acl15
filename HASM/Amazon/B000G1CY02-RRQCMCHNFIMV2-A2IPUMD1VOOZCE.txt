Title: Great on warming - for a foot or two around the heater.
Content:
As other reviewers did, I bought this heater because it was a Consumer Reports top pick. What a joke. I left the heater on for 6 hours in a closed (insulated) basement room and the temperature was barely a few degrees above the unheated space outside that room. Very disappointing, both in DeLonghi and Consumer Reports  reviewing.

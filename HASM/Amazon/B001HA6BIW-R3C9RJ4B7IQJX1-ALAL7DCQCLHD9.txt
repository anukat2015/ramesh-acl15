Title: Beware of overheating
Content:
I purchased this item for the livingroom.  It heats the room up well.  There are two buttons, one for oscillation and the other for on/off/temperature settings.  The sound isn't too distracting, and the high setting isn't loud.  My family used it for about a week, and tonight while it was running in the livingroom the power in half the house went out.  Since it was the only new item we were using I reached for the plug and it was very hot from the plug to the first two inches of cord from it.  Once I unplugged it, the electricity went back on.  The problem could be with this particular one I got, but I don't plan on testing that theory out.  I'll be returning it soon.  Just be careful if trying one out.

Title: Love it!
Content:
We are big coffee drinkers and have several pots a day.  We've gone through many brands of coffeemakers of all prices and types, but have found the perfect one for us.  Several months ago, we were flying 1200 miles from home and half-way there discovered we hadn't turned the coffee pot off!  So, when getting a new pot, an automatic "turn off" was essential to us.  It turns off in 2 hours... and if you want to continue heating the pot beyond that, just hit the on/off switch again.  It has a wonderful pouring lip that never drips, is easy to fill and clean but. of course, the most important thing to us is it makes great coffee.  We whole-heartedly recommend this Black and Decker Smartbrew Coffeemaker.

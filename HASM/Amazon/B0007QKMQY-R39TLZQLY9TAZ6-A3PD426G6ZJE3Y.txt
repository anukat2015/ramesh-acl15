Title: Easy to use
Content:
This is the kind of camera you can pull out of the box, pop in the memory card and battery and start taking photos.  The menus and various buttons are obvious and easy to figure out.  It's also sturdy (albeit heavy).  I especially enjoy being able to take rapid sequence photos without an irritating lag between photos.

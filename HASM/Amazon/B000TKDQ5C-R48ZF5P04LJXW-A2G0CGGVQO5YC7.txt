Title: Its good. It does what it promises to do.
Content:
Its good. It does what it promises to do. I would recommend it if you are looking for a small, cheap space heater, for a relatively small space. I used it in a 12*12ft room with 12ft ceilings - so actually bigger than most regular cookie cutter apartments, and I had no problems at all.

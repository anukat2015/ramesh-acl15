Title: ScanDisk Sansa m250
Content:
I had some trouble updating the firmware at first. The menu was not reliable and is still not.
Sansa m250 is probably worth what I paid. I do not know if I would purchase another.
The ScanDisk technical support site is totally worthless. They are very unresponsibe. However, Amazon stands behind what they sell.

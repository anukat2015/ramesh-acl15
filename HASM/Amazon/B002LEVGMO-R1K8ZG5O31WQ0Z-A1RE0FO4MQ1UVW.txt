Title: No Problems with a Replacement
Content:
Update (9/22/09): Received a replacement unit fast (thank you Amazon) - no hardware issues. Installed additional 2 GB of RAM and rebuilt with MS Vista Business. Used for work - have VMware server running. For business purposes great little machine. My current rating - 4 stars (One star lost due to quality control missing defective headphone jack).
********
Received today - defective out of the box. Internal speaker works only when headphones are plugged in. Waiting for a replacement unit.

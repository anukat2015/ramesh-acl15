Title: Simply......PERFECT!!!!
Content:
Great beginner DSLR.  I bought a Canon S5IS, and hated it.  The small sensor made the pictures very nosy..so I decided to step up to a DSLR.
I was thinking of getting a Nikon D40X, but I was told that Canon's line of lenses are much better..and I don't have to waste money and buy specific auto focus lenses because Nikon's D40x doesn't have it built in.  I don't mean to trash Nikon, but the Canon EOS Rebel XTi is simply a better camera compared to the D40x.

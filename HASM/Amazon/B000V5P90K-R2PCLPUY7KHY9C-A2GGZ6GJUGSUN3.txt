Title: Great quality and usability
Content:
When I got it, this was Canon's top camera in the ~$1000 range (now replaced by the 50D). The next step up is the 5D series in the ~$2500 range, a bit too pricey for me.
I upgraded to the 40D from the 400D. The most noticable differences are that it's bigger, heavier, more rugged, has some weather sealing, has more controls, and has an extra LCD on top. All these things are good. I am male and have somewhat large hands, so I really like the ergonomics of the camera. I couldn't stand holding the 400D without a battery grip while the 40D feels just right without one. The extra LCD and buttons on top of the camera are really useful for quickly adjusting the shooting parameters.
It has great image quality, low noise, and lots of features. Check out other reviews and/or read the specifications for more details.
The biggest limitation of this camera, in my opinion, is that it only displays lower-resolution versions of the photos on the LCD, making it useless for checking sharpness and focus accuracy. This is important when low depth of field is involved or when you're concerned about camera shake. The 50D displays the full-resolution image while also having a higher-resolution LCD, though I'm waiting for the 60D before upgrading, in hopes of it having video functionality.
So, I heartily recommend the 40D, though you should probably go for the 50D, or wait for the 60D.

Title: Get a second grinder assembly
Content:
I have had mine for about two years now and agree with many of the other reviewers who liked this machine. I just have one thing to add:
As many people have said, the grinder assembly is more of a hassle to keep washed than are non-integrated grinder coffeemakers. Yes, it goes in the dishwasher, but invariably you have forgotten to run it and it's now the next morning when you just want your coffee and the last thing you want to do is stand at the sink and dig out all the caked-on grounds. I solved this problem recently by buying a second grinder assembly directly from Cuisinart so that I always have a clean set, but before it was available, cleaning was a bit of a pain. That adds $25 to the cost of the machine (more if you buy 2nd sets of other washable parts), but if you're bad about remembering to wash it like me, then it's probably worth it.

Title: Can't compare to the IPOD.
Content:
Tried this, but I ended up exchanging it on a new IPOD classic.  It's ok but as for features, style, and performance nothing beats the new IPODS.  The sound quality on the Zen is poor compared to any IPOD, but better than the flat Zune sound.  The battery life needs serious imporving, my IPOD holds 120 gb of music and I charge it once every 7-10 days using it 2 hrs per day, this ZEN requires charging every second day holding only 32gb of music only, that sucks.  The screen resolution is good, the buttons are nice but a little annoying in wher they are placed, sometimes you can hit three buttons at the one time making you lose what soung you were listening to.  The size and shape of this device is great, about the size of a credit card only thicker.  The SD card expansion slot is good but it does not intergrate the files into your collection which makes it kind of pointless.  The thing I hate most about this player is the file organization or total lack there of.  It turns alot of file info unknowns that work on every other device easily, it copies the same albums or songs onto it's hard drive three and four times wasting memory.  It's always annoying to not be able to copy all your music because you have about a hundred files duplicated on the player.  If you looking for a basic mp3 player an IPOD would be best and has by far the best quality, avoid Zune as they take forever to charge, drain fast and takes hours to sync making them pretty much useless, but for basic music needs this Zen player is decent but pricy for what it offers.

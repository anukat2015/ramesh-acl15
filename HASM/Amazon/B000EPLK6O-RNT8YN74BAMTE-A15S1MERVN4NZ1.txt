Title: Makes less coffee than expected
Content:
I like the coffee maker so I won't repeat all the good things said in the other reviews.  My only negative is that for a 5 cup coffee maker it actually makes less coffee than my old 4 cup Krups.  The Krups didn't quite fill my thermos; I assumed the Zojirushi would, but I'm now drinking somewhat less coffee than before.

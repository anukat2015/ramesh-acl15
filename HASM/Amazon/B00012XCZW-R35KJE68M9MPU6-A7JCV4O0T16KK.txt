Title: Looking for good coffee?
Content:
Do you care if your coffee is brewed at the proper temperature?  Do you like your coffee flavorful?  In a hurry and need your coffee in 1 minute?  Then this is the coffee maker for you.  This Bunn coffee maker keeps water in a holding tank near 200 degrees so that when you add the amount of water you want for your coffee, the Bunn coffee maker instantly sprays the 200 degree water from the holding tank evenly over the coffee grounds.  It makes 6 cups of coffee in less than 2 minutes.  Definitely pleased with it and recommend it.

Title: Great spacemaker machine
Content:
I didn't think I would like this coffee machine, but I love it. It takes up less space than my previous machine due to the water tank being flat instead of tall. I have much more space on my counter underneath the coffee machine now. A carafe that has a lid that stays in place while pouring? Wonderful. Easy removal for easy cleaning. Excellent design!

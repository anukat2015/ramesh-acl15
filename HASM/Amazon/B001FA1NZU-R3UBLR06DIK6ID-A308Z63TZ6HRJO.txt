Title: DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON, GO TO APPLE!
Content:
Amazon will not "exchage" a non-working product, they will refund your money, which takes weeks and then you can purchase what you wanted in the first place. Apple will not"exchage" either because you purchased outside of thier stores. GREAT! When I pay almost $300 for an item, I expect it to work or I want a new product, I really believe I am intitled to that, right?

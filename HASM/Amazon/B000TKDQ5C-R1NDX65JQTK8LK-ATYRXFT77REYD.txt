Title: as expected/good enough
Content:
as previously stated on other reviews----this is a good unit for the price---it really only has one speed of fan---heats a small space(bathroom, tv room ) very well---price is right( I paid $18.99 with free shipping )---satisfied customer--received in two days via fedex ground

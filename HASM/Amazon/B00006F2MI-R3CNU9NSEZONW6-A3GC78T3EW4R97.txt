Title: worst design ever invented
Content:
The engineers that designed this one obviously drink tea!!
The grinder is worthless and wastes lots of coffee. Then it gets all of condensation heat so you have a gooey mess.
The worst part is the all plastic door. It seems that when it gets hot the latch loosens up, door pops open and water goes everywhere. This problem happens at least 10% of time.
Do not waste money on this junk!

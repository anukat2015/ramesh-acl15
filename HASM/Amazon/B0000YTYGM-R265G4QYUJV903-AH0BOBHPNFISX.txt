Content:
I love this coffeemaker.  It replaces the exact same one that I had been using for 5 years, then quit suddenly.  It takes getting used to but it's worth it.  The carafe is well insulated and keeps the coffee warm for 10 hours if the lid is kept in place. If you are patient and kind to this product it will provide you with exceptional service. Critics have said that it pours too slowly, the buzzer is too loud, it overflows, and on and on.  CALM DOWN if these things bother you please don't drink caffeine at all.  Beleive me, I have had every possible coffeemaker available in my lifetime.  This is the only, and probably the last, I will ever purchase.

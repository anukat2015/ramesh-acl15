Title: WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Content:
I love this vacuum cleaner! I have about as much hard wood floor in my house as I do carpet and it works great on both. I use all of the attachments; one for baseboards, one for the hard floors, and I love the suction control on the main vacuum attachment to use on throw rugs. Of course it also works great on both plush and berber carpet. It is not very loud and I love not having to buy bags. The self-cleaning filters and retractable cord are also great features. I have my house cleaned by housekeepers once a month and they said that they wish all of their clients owned a vacuum like this. You won't regret this purchase.

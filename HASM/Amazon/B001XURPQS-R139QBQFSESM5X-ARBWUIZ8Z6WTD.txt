Title: Awesome Camera
Content:
I use to think that picture quality from subcompact camera are good enough and never understood why people would carry a bulk DSLR camera.  However, the picture quality is just unbelievable!  I don't understand all the different buttons and settings yet, but the pictures I have taken with the Canon Rebel T1i have been absolutely amazing!  If you have kids or if you are using a camera to capture special moments, then for a few hundred dollars more, you'll get something that you can really treasure forever!

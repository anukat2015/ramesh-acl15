Title: great addition to my cleaning arsenal
Content:
I got this little wonder as a gift last Christmas and love it!  This stylish vacuum lives easily on my side table; I love the curvy lines that help disguise the function of this piece.  I find the suction is adequate for my needs, but I'm picking up stray crumbs rather than balls of pet hair which makes a difference.  I've had no problems with this vacuum holding a charge, and it definitely out-performs dust-busters I've had in the past.  This vacuum has a great addition to my cleaning arsenal and saves me the hassle of wrestling out the full-sized vacuum for smaller messes.  High recommended!

Title: Good vacuum, but cheaply made
Content:
It's a very good vacuum, except for a plastic piece that has already broken off (after only one month of use). Fortunately, the piece that broke off is the quick release button, so you can still release the hose by pushing down on the metalic button. Other than that, the vacuum is great. Easy to use, really good suction power, and great accessories. I would recommend, but hopefully nothing else will break.

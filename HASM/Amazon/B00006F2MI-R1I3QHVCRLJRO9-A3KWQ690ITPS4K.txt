Title: This is my first review of a product
Content:
This product created enormous messes!!!!  Bad functional design, was probably NEVER prototyped.  The grinder needs to be absolutely clean and dry even w/ steam (from brewing) gets all inside the grinder.  Grinder never sends coffee to the filter.The coffee pot (on the thermos) valve gets stuck and over flows (all over).The coffee pot needs to positioned perfectly to accept coffee from above.

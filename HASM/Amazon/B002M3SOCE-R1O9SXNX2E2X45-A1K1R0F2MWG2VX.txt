Title: Apple iPod touch 32 GB (3rd Generation) NEWEST MODEL
Content:
Pros - easy to setup and use. Storage space is good for now. 
Cons - email application may need to be tweaked from your ISP provider.
I was able to setup email and receive mail but it wasn't able to send email 
from any where outside my home network. I'm sure it's a simple call to Charter for the fix.

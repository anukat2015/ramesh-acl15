Title: Nice looking, but not HOT
Content:
I bought this coffee maker from Sears only hours ago, and rushed home to experience fresh, piping hot java.
Before throwing out my old Mr. Coffee, I decided to race the two for speed of brewing and temperature. The Cuisinart brewed 10 "cups" of coffee in 7 minutes and 28 seconds, at 168 degrees F (in the pot). My old Mr. Coffee, which is 3 years old, brewed 10 "cups" of coffee in just over 13 minutes, at 166 degrees F.
After letting both sit for 20 minutes- the Cuisinart was still holding at around 165 degrees (which is pretty good considering that there is no warmer plate- just the insulated carafe), while Mr. Coffee had dropped to 160F.
In all, the Cuisinart looks nice, and I like that it will use less electricity due to not needing a warmer plate. However, I drink my coffee with cream, and I want HOT coffee- so I need a pot that will put coffee in the pot at a hotter temp. I was disappointed that the Cuisinart didn't brew coffee much hotter than my old Mr. Coffee.
Also, the controls are difficult to use and see. The LCD display is not backlit, and the control know is hard to turn. I would definitely NOT recommend this coffee maker for folks with vision or dexterity issues.
To sum, the Cuisinart is nice looking, but not HOT. I'm going to return it and keep looking.

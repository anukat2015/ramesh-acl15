Title: Do not buy first generation of Zune.
Content:
Well...I know I would regret it and I did. I got myself a Zune and it's going back tomorrow. I wanted to like the Zune because I think Apple needs a nemisis. (competition is good as the saying goes) But, the product feels like a prototype. I placed the Zune next to my IPod. The Ipod looks sleek and elegant and the Zune looks like it's ugly cousin. It's bigger, heavier and chunky. 
OK! So it has wireless but so what. How many Zune are you going to find out there. Let's say you want to use it to tape a lecture or a meeting and you want to pass it along with your Zune buddy. Well that lecture or anything you created also dies in 3 play or 3 days. And let's say you play 30 seconds of the song and decide to stop, well counts as 1 play. 
The Big screen...Well the screen is bigger but the resolution is the same. The test shot I did didn't look good and the album covers look fuzzier and not as crisp as it did not IPod. 
13 hour battery life is not true. If you want 13 hour battery life you have to listen to in default volume and play the same album over and over and turn off the wireless. 
It may have an OK interface and the guest sync is good but if you are in the market for a MP3 player, don't go for the Zune. While it has feature Ipod doesn't you won't be sharing anything with anybody because they are not going to be popular. There aren't that many songs, the marketplace doesn't have podcast, tv shows, video and host of other things you can get from Itunes. 
In short if you really want a MS product wait for the 4th generation and maybe then you should get it.

Title: VERY POWERFUL - But a bit heavy
Content:
This is an excellent little vac - quite powerful. It pulled up dirt and dust we didn't even know was there! The brushes are so strong, it almost can be classified as self-propelling.
PROS - Very strong.  It does a great job.  Bagless - no bags to buy...  Ajustable suction settings are great for small area rugs.
CONS - The unit can be heavy & a little difficult to carry up and down the stairs.  Since it is bagless, you have to empty the container often... The cord is a little too short.  Also, not all the attachments fit into the unit for storage.  
Still overall a great buy and rated very highly on various websites.  Cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else!

Title: Great camera.
Content:
Very good camera. I am not a professional photographer, but this camera was not recommeneded by photo enthusiasts and professionals, but after taking pictures with this camera, I am very happy I chose this instead of the expensive Canikons. The picture quality is very good, the live view is great, in-camera image stabilization and so many features that the professional grade cameras have. Absolutely love it.

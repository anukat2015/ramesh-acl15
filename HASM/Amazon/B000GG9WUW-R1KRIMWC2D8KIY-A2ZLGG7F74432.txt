Title: Break in less than two months
Content:
I put the heater on the carpet and one day I accidentally hit it. It only fell to the carpet. The fan detached and you can't fix it as they say there is no user serviceable parts inside. Because it is over 30 days, I have to pay $11 to have it repaired or replaced + cost of sending it back. Better buy a heater at a nearby Target or Sears where you can return defective item easily. This heater is noisy too.

Title: A company without knowledge of quality assurance!
Content:
My particular dissatisfaction is with the Model 47686.  Leaks from day one getting progressively worse as time went by.  In all fairness, the brew station made exceptional coffee...........if you didn't mind cleaning up the mess on a daily basis.  Tried all methods of troubleshooting and then read the reviews on Amazon.com to discover everyone who purchased the BrewStation had the same or similar problems.  Great concept...Poor product!

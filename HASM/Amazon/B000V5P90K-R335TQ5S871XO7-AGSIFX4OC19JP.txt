Title: Fantastic DSLR
Content:
I usually spend a lot of time researching electronic before I purchase it. And it was the same with the Canon 40D. I was debating between the 40D and the 5D. The 5D was substantially more expensive, but I really wanted the a full-framed camera. The 5D has been around for a couple of years and the new refresher model will be out around Q3 08'with better features and functions. I just couldn't wait that long per I had a few travel plans this summer that needed the camera. So the decision was made to go with the 40D.
This camera is amazingly fast with the DigicIII processor and 6.5 frames per second. The live view function helps a lot for those moments when you can't view the shot through the view finder. With a 3" screen it makes viewing on the live view mode simple to see the details. The autofocus in live view mode is also accurate and clear (you need to push the autofocus button near the right thumb for it autofocus; pushing down halfway on the shutter button to autofocus does not work for live view). For the price, this camera is a bargain with all the high-end function it has.
The grip, weight distribution and overall feel of the camera is very solid and gives you a great balance for any shot.
I would highly recommend this camera for people that are upgrading from a XTi or considering to go into photography. Not to make light of its "mid range" dslr modeling, but this camera is used as a second camera or backup for many professional photographers and wedding photographers.

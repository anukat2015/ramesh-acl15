Title: unbelievable
Content:
I vacuumed yesterday with a vacuum that was about a year old, although admitedly it was a cheap little vacuum. We went out and bought the pet hair eraser last night.  Obviously there was a lot the other vacuum had left behind. 
We've had a cat for less than a year, but apparently our carpets were very dirty. We only have 2 rooms with carpet but we filled that canister three times. Not only did it pick up lots hair but tons of dirt. Our carpets look new! I thought they were going to have to be replaced very soon.
Of course, the test will be how long this thing lasts...

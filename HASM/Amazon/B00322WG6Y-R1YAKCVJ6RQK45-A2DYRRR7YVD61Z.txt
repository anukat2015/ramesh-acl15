Title: A Business Loss
Content:
This purchase was a disappointment.  Within less than a month after purchase in November 2009, the wireless card stopped functioning.  Lenovo/IBM Customer Service was slow to respond, provided inaccurate information and instructions, required that I pay to ship the product to the service center for warranty repair, and communicated a general lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Without prior notice, Lenovo cancelled the service request. It is now March 24, 2010, and the laptop remains inoperable for the purpose intended.

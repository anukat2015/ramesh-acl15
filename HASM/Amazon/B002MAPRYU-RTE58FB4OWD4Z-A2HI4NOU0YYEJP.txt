Title: Sansa good on replacement
Content:
This unit's battery has not held the charge well at all.  I have a 2GB Sansa that holds its charge longer than this 4GB unit, yet the 2 GB is 2 year's older.  In addition, this 4GB Sansa Clip doesn't advance from one media marker to the next.  I have to advance it manually.  I've contacted Sansa about these issues.  So far, they've had me do multiple technical changes which have done nothing to solve the problems. I assume this unit is defective and other units of this model work as advertised.  
Update,  I contacted Sansa about my unit's problems.  After Sansa asked that I perform several actions, none of which solved the problems my unit had, Sansa sent me a new unit.  The new unit operates as I expected it would based on my use of my 2 GB Sansa MP3 player.  I think that originally I received a defective unit.

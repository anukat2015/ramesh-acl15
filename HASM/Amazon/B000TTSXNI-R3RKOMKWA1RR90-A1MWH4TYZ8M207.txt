Title: Good things come in little packages
Content:
We got this heater for the nursery in mid-winter when all stores were hittong on spring. It was a good buy. It heats a 12 x 12 room pretty quickly. I just wish Lasko makes a heater with good wires behind. This is our third heater from Lasko and we liked all our previous purchases too. Excet that the wires break off slowly and there is no way to repair that. At least we dont know of any.

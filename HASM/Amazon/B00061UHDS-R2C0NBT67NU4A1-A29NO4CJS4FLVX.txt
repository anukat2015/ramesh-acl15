Title: Great Camera
Content:
This camera is well worth every penny.  I shoot mostly wildlife and landscape photograpy and both my Zuiko 14-45mm and 40-150mm lenses see plenty of action.  The 14-45 is a great all purpose lense that doubles both as a semi-wide angle and a short Telescopic lens.  The 40-150 is a short tele that performs as it is supposed to.
Picture quality is the best I have had yet out of a camera.  This is my third olympus camera for this reason alone because in the long run this is what matters most.  
I compared this to the equivalent Canon, Nikon and Minolta Cameras and am glad i make this choice.  The lens kit is superior, the battery life is nearly eternal (I have taken approx 3000 shots and recharged the battery only 3 times), and the camera is very durable.  
Olympus also upgraded its software package that has been greatly improved from their previous software.  
All in all, this is a steal for the price, especially since the E330 is now on the market.

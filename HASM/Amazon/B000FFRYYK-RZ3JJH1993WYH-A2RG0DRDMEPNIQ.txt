Title: Awesome Brewer
Content:
This is the best coffee brewer I have ever owned.  Biggest problem with most machines is they simply don't brew hot enough.  Not the case with the Bunn.  It is a no frills machine that does one thing and does it extremely well.  Makes a great cup of coffee.  It differs from most home machines in that it has two tanks and keeps one hot all the time.  It does seem like a waste of electricity to me as I only brew one pot in the A.M., so I turn it off after brewing, and flip it back on before I go to bed so it will be ready to roll in the morning.  You could also easily throw a timer on the plug to do the same thing.  No problems with dripping thermos, as the lid has been redesigned from the older problematic design.  It is also the fastest brewer I have ever owned.  Probably takes about 5 minutes to brew a pot. Highly recommend.

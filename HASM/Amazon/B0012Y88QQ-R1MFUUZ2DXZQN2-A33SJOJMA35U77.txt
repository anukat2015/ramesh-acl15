Title: My first DSLR
Content:
This is my first DSLR, so I'm not expert. But it took really good pictures for me. I took some bad pictures too because I don't what what I'm doing. But one time a stranger gave me some hints on setting the shutter speed etc for the sporting event that we were in and all the pictures turned out great.

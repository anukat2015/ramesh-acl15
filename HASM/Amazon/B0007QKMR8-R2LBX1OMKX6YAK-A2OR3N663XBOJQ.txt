Title: Awesome Camera!  Totally satisfied!
Content:
I purchased this camera a few days ago, and I like it more and more with each passing day.  When I first held the camera in the store, I did not like the smallness of the camera.  I have average sized hands, but the camera still felt too small.  I have the original Canon Rebel, which always felt good in my grip.  I purchased the Xt despite the size (i am a megapixel junkie) and I am glad that I did.
This camera is small, but mighty.  It is fast, sleek and caputres colors and subtle shadows flawlessly.  I settled on the silver finish, which looks classy and solid.  The original Rebel, although comfortable to hold, always looked a bit cheap, and too plastic like.  The new Xt does not.  I have yet to make an enlargement, but I am confident that I can go up to 16x20 inches without feeling a loss of quality.  
I am a high school art teacher with a degree in photography, so I have developed an eye for color and texture over the years.  I am very demanding of my photographic equipment.  I know that I will not be dissappointed with the Rebel Xt.  
I use a 512K memory card, which is on the small size, but does not seem to slow down the camera at all.  I am delighted with this purchase.  Considering the price difference between the Rebel Xt, and the Canon 20D, it does not make sense to spend $500.00 more for 1/2 a megapixel difference.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Xt  out performs and out sells the 20D.  So, my advice is BUY this camera.  It is lightweight, fast, sleek and delivers impressive results.

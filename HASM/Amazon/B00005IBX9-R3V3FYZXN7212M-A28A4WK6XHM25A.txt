Title: Makes good coffee but !!!!!!!!!!!
Content:
This is a replacement for the Cuisnart grind and brew. I had problems with the basket getting jammed and it was impossible to remove. Cuisnart replaced the coffee maker and after a few months the same thing. I decided to just get a neww coffee maker and buy a grinder(kitchen aide) which I am very happy with. The coffee pot is another story. I read the reviews and decided to get it even though there were some flaws. It is difficult to put water in without getting water all over the counter. When the lid is opened again water gets all over the counter. the coffee pot does not slide in evenly so care must be taken. Just alot of design flaws. I just visited Lowe's and looked at coffee pots. I was amazed at how well engineered some coffe pots are and priced about the same as the dcc-1200. Wish I would have waited and gone to Lowe's first. If you don't want to be constantly cleaning up, stay away from this one.

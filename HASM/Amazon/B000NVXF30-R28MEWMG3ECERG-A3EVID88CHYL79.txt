Title: While waiting for the E-1's successor................
Content:
I have been shooting with my E-1 for over four years now and I, along with many others, have been waiting patiently for a model which meets today's professional standards. I will be using this camera as a back-up when the E-3 finally arrives.
The build quality is excellent. Image quality is superb and I am now a fan of the body based image stabilization. The camera is feature packed and I am still learning to take advantage of the latest tricks in Olympus's bag. There are several very good DVDs already available for this model from a QuickPro DVD Tutorial for beginners to the more comprehensive and advanced Jump Start Guide, both of which are available on Amazon. The owner's manual included with the camera is better than past efforts, although I recommend downloading the free PDF and printing it on letter size paper.

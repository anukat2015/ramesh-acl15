Content:
I bought this product as a heater for my den and being that it is drafty old home  I wasn't sure it would work but it does and if it can heat my den it will do well anywhere. It is quiet. The look is a bit weird because it looks like a TV but its so skinny that fits anywhere. I would definetly reccomend this product.

Title: Piece of garbage tried to burn my house down
Content:
I thought this would be the coffee maker of my dreams, being single I thought it would be a bit like having a really sweet and thoughtful boyfriend. Freshly ground and brewed coffee waiting for me when I woke up. 
However, the grinder and all its various impossible to clean parts needs to be thoroughly cleaned and dried every time it is used, so it creates a mountain of extra work every day. 
If the carafe is not in exactly the right place you will have a horrible coffee mess everywhere unless it is the spring loaded basket popping out creating the giant mess so expect at least one giant mess a week from this beauty and all before you have had your cup of coffee. How absolutely charming! 
Plus it makes weak coffee so for a decent cup of coffee you can't make a full pot which is probably for the best because it will be cold before you have had a chance to drink it. 
Initially I thought it would be a smallish price to pay to wake up to freshly ground and brewed coffee and generally less trouble than a boyfriend. But then one morning after only owning it two months I came down from my shower and the thing was ON FIRE. Less like a boyfriend and more like a crazy stalker from hell.
They sent me a replacement coffee maker which I was too afraid to use on a timer again. So no freshly ground and brewed coffee upon awakening for me. To add insult to injury the grinder on the second model stopped working after three months. Not such a giant deal since I had long stopped using it because of the weak coffee issue. I didn't call for another replacement. I didn't want to see that piece of garbage on my counter anymore. Good riddance.

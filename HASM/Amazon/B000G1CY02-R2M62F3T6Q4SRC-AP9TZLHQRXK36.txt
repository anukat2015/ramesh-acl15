One of the best heaters I've ever had!  It heats up very fast, is very light and I really like the look of it.  I don't hang mine on the wall, but I think it's pretty cool that you can.
The only three small complaints that I have: 
1) I had to send the first one back to Amazon because it made a loud popping noise when it would kick on.  It sounded like maybe something inside was expanding and rubbing against another part.  Amazon sent me a replacement and this one works perfectly. If I didn't get this thing from Amazon, who knows what headaches I would have had to go through to get a replacement.
2) It's not really thermostatically controlled.  The higher the settings, the longer it stays on in it's on/off cycle.. and that's it!  I use the heater in my room at night because I turn the heat in the rest of the house down to 50.  When it gets cold enough for the main heat to turn on, it gets very hot in my bedroom because this thing continues to turn on and off in the same cycle.  It does NOT sense that it's hot in the room and not turn on.
3) The first time you use it, you HAVE to turn it on in the garage or outside.. because the smoke and smell are pretty foul.  I guess the stuff they use for corrosion control in the warehouse burns off.  I put mine on high for about an hour in the garage and it burned off.  No smell at all now.
Like I said, they're pretty small complaints compaired to how much I love this heater and what a great value it is.

Title: What about Flash Player
Content:
This is my first Ipod (or apple product of anykind). I was excited to have a portable internet browser - just WiFi, not 3G phone based, BUT, several of the websites I regularly use require Flash Player, which Apple will not support - what's up with that? If it doesn't work as an internet device, don't call it that. I'm not into the gaming or even the music that much - mostly video (online TV, etc), web browsing and email (email seem ok). I think it's going back. Is there another solution other than BUYING each episode from ITunes?

Title: AWESOME!
Content:
i got the 4gb Zen cause it was so cheap, but i loved it so much, i just sold it to get either a 8 or 16 gb model! yes, i used to have the Zen Vision M, which was a great player, but Creative has come a long way and it really shows in this player. the sound quality is just as good or even better than the ZVM, but the size of the screen remains the same, while significantly slimming down the entire player to credit card size and giving you the addition of the SD/SDHC card function really gives you your moneys worth! i was able to fit 6 family guy episodes, 1 episode of House and around 240 songs onto a 2gb SD card and eventhough the card function is kept separate, it works great! you get two libraries here! amazing! a tiny, light and very sleek looking player that packs a mean punch, a lovely screen, great audio, lots of options, great battery life, bright, and very easy to use. and like other reviewers here, i agree that the buttons are a bit small and they should have made them light up like the ZVM, but those details are very minor and the pros definately outweigh the cons here.

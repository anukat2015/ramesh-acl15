Title: Small, quiet and powerful -- It's a winner!
Content:
After driving my family insane shopping for vacuums I finally settled on the Miele.  I purchased a Dyson DC21, but returned it in the first week due to its poor construction.  I was close to buying a Sears cannister, but was concerned about the poor quality and I thought that it was noisy and heavy.  I had heard that Miele was the best and quite honestly didn't want to spend upwards of $800 for a vacuum.  But, after spending an hour at the local vacuum store (Mr. Sweeper in W. Roxbury, MA - -they rock!!) looking at various brands and talking with one of the sales people I finally settled on the Miele.  
I have to admit -- it is a really great vacuum.  It is extremely powerful and still very quiet.  It rolls easily around the house and with the long hose and cord it has an incredible reach.  The HEPA filtration is so good that I think the air is actually cleaner after I vacuum.
Other features that I like:
* It is solid!  The plastic is the same material used to make motorcycle helmets and you can swing the unit by the cord it's so well attached.
* The exhaust is on the top so it doesn't spread dust around as you sweep.
If you can afford the cost, I highly recommend it.

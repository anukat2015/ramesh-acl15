Title: Not all files play
Content:
I bought this for audiobooks that we download from our local libray. They are WMA format, and the Zune says that it plays WMA files, but when I tried to transfer it wouldn't work. After deeper reasearch I discovered that it will indeed play WMA files, but only if you buy them from the Zune store. It seemed like a good player but I returned it right away, so I didn't get a chance to explore it. I bought a Creative Zen and it is sweet and played all my files perfectly, including the audiobooks.

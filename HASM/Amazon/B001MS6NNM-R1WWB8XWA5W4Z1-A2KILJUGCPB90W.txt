Title: Vaio thoughts
Content:
Things to like:
- The keyboard
- The size and weight
- The blueray
- The speed of start up and in running complex programs
- The size and shape of the screen
Thing not to like
- The battery runs about 3 hours or less
- Although the picture quality is good, it is not excellent. I would have now opted for the full HD screen. I miss the clarity of my Dell full HD.My bad. 
- Heat in the under hand area is a nuisance.
- No lock down when closed

Title: My First iPod!
Content:
This is my first iPod ever.  Before this, I owned the Archos Jukebox 2000 which holds 20GB.  This 8gb Nano blows that other heavy hunk of junk away.  The nano is quiet, small, thin, lightweight, plays everything seamlessly, and is a breeze to use.  If you're buying your first MP3 player ever, I definitely recommend the Nano.  It is really worth every bit of the 199 I paid for it.  The screen is beautiful.  It's very bright and crisp.  Cover flow is awesome, although I don't use the cover flow as much as I use the "artist" listings.  
Compared to the 2G nano, the new 3G nano has it beaten hands down.  3.5mm thin!  I mean, if you carry it in your pocket, you can hardly tell it's in there.  
I really bought the new Nano to occupy me until the Touch comes out and it's doing just that.  I'm plenty occupied and satisfied!
BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A GREAT IPOD WITH GREAT FEATURES FOR THE MONEY!

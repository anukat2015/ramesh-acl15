Title: Apple 160 it is big on size but not on performance
Content:
I like many others decided that I wanted to get the 160 because I had filled up the 60 I had and wanted the convenience of being able to have all of my music in one place. I like the size of the 160 but it is very slow to get started and especially slow on transition between menus.  If I had a chance to do it again, I think I would have stuck with the 60 and the inconvenience of choosing songs to put on it rather than deal with the slow 160 just my opinion.

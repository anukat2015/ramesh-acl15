Title: Solid Product
Content:
The Zune delivers everything that I expected except it cannot be used as an external hard drive without a hack.... which is why I gave it 4 stars, not 5. 
The exterior is superior to the iPod since it won't scratch. The quality of the music and video are nothing short of spectacular.  The radio is a nice added bonus and the wireless capability has a lot of potential.
Basically, you cannot trust anyone who gives this a 1 star because like the iPod it is a quality product.

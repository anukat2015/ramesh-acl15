Title: Another amazing version of the iPod!
Content:
I bought this iPod to replace my 20GB 4th generation iPod. I was so amazed when it arrived and was actually slightly smaller despite the 8x larger capacity! I love the new menu designs and cover flow. This is my first ipod with video capability and I love the way movies and music videos look on it.
My one complaint is that Apple has disabled the ability to turn on TV out to play iPod videos on a TV. And I didn't find this out until AFTER I had bought a cord specifically for this purpose.

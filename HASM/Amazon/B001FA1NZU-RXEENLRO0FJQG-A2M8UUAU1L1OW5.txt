Title: Great Device
Content:
I absolutely love my Ipod Touch 2G. I bought an Ipod 16gb 1G for my daughter last year and knew immediately that I had to have one. I waited a whole year before buying one and I am not disappointed with it. Great screen size and color, sounds really good and plays really well when docked on a speaker. I have not used the earphones yet because of the built-in speaker. You won't be disappointed.

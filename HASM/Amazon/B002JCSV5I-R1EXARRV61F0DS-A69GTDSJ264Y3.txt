Title: Great choice!
Content:
Really happy with our choice.  Debated for a long while about a super zoom or more portable point and shoot, but just can't stand the delayed response.  This isn't exactly "slip in your pocket" portable, but for the great pics and super responsiveness, it's worth it.

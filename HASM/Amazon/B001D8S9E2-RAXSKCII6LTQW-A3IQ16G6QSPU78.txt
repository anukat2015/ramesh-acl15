Title: Worth every single penny
Content:
Pros:
LED Backlit screen. 
2GB of 1066MHz DDR3 SDRAM, sure most Pcs come with 4GB of Ram but are they DDR3 running at 1066Mhz? i don't think so.
1066MHz frontside bus, that's another thing you should take into account when buying any machine 
graphics processor with 256MB
802.11n integrated
5 hour battery life, that's also a nice to have
Precision aluminum unibody enclosure, that makes this machine look like a Ferrari compared to others
Cons: No FireWire which was nice to have on the older models, but that a lot of people will not miss cause not everyone has a need for it, and  since USB 3.0 is just around the corner, FireWire, R.I.P.
My own opinion is, don't be fool by cheap laptop prices, one example is, you buy any brand laptop for $999  with 4GB of SDDR2 ram running at 667mhz and you think you got a good deal, think again cause everyone is moving forward with SDDR3 Ram and in 5 months your going to need a new machine as even microsoft pushes out new updates, in other words your machine pretty soon is going to be running slows as a turtle, the new Macbooks have all that cover, that's why in my opinion no other machines run even windows vista as flawlessly as the macs

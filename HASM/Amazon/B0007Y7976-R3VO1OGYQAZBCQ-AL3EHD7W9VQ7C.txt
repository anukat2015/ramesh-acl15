Title: 8GB 2nd gen. iPod nano
Content:
2nd best iPod I've ever owned.  I rate it second due to lack of capacity, but that's what the iPod w/video is for..storing all my stuff.  I got this after my 30GB 5Gen iPod died, as a hold over until the news came out this fall about the new lineup of iPods.  I must say the sound on the nano almost seems better than the sound on my dead 30GB, and who can complain about the size.
It definately took a while to get used to the much smaller scroll wheel and screen, specifically the location of the smaller click wheel in reference to the size of the whole nano.
I have a library ~40GB, so having to switch to manually managing my music and deciding every few days/weeks what to take off and put on got kind of old.  After hearing of so many issues with the new generation iPod classics, I went to the Apple.com store and bought a refurbished 80GB 5.5gen for a little over $200.  I'll keep the nano for the beach, biking, etc, and be able to keep all my music on my 80GB.
Overall, a solid 5 star iPod.  Especially for people with smaller iTunes library's who don't have to worry about what to put on or take off the iPod nano!

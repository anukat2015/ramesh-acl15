Title: beware of coffee leaking when.....
Content:
Purchased 2 months ago. I expected a fully stainless steel coffee maker with glass pot. I got the glass pot however the coffee maker is actually plastic construction with stainless steel clad cover.
I kept it anyway because it has other features like the ability to remove the water tank to clean it.
The down side of this coffee maker is that if the coffee pot is not fully installed into the coffee maker the coffee will continue to brew and spill all over the surrounding area.
I realize that I need to operate the coffee maker properly to avoid this spill-over condition,however the coffee pot was placed into the coffee maker and just inside the lip that holds the pot in place. The lip that holds the pot in place should be a bit taller because the small lip can allow the pot to move out slightly and then the coffee will not go into the pot.
So, I would not buy this coffee maker again due to this design quirk.

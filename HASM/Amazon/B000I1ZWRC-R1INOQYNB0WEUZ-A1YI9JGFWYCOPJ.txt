Title: Consistently Dark/Underexposed Pictures
Content:
The camera produces dark pictures and needs manual exposure compensation to correct this. I have used a Canon film SLR camera for years and compared to that, it certainly feels there is something wrong in the metering of this camera. I am returning mine tomorrow.

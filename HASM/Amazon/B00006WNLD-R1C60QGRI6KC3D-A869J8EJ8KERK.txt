Title: It Keeps Going and Going....
Content:
I've had this product for at least 5 years, and it still works as well as the day I got it.  I love having only a single cup to go.  It can be a pain to find the #1 coffee filters that go with this item, but usually I'll just buy the #2 filter (which is everywhere) and cut it to fit.  Now I'm ready to buy a new one, b/c after that long, the white begins to look grungy.  I'd like to find the same model in stainless steel.  Not sure if they have it, but I'm about to look.

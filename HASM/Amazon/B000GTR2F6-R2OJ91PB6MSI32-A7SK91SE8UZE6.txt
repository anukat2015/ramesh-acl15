Title: AWESOME! Perfect
Content:
I have the B60 and my grand father who is 72 loved the coffee and how easy it was to just brew up whatever you wanted within seconds, so me and my family pitched in and bought this latest version the B70 along with his favorites and some new K-cups to try and he and my grand-mother who is 68 LOVE IT!!! They've had it a month and they are still talking about how much they love it.  They drink coffee every morning, of course and it's so easy to use, so fast and you don't have to make a whole pot when you just want one cup.  
I rely heavily on Reviews when I buy stuff at Amazon, so I wanted to be sure and let everyone know this is a great product for people who drink one or two cups, need something fast and even for older people.  I'm single and don't drink a lot of coffee so it's perfect for me to make some hot tea or a cup of flavor'd coffee when I'm in the mood, fast easy, no hassle.

Title: Disappointing
Content:
Contrary to it's claim, this coffeemaker will not accept a #4 filter.  It is also very difficult to open and very difficult to center properly for the coffee to flow into the carafe.  Also, the cap to the carafe has to be removed before making coffee.  All of these drawbacks taken together make this one of the worst coffeemakers I have ever owned.

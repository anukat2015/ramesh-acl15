Title: Not like it was advertised.
Content:
Though I knew that it was factory reconditioned, it was more like an used one.  I was quite disappointed when it came in with a lot of scratches on both sides and on the top.  It definitely couldn't be caused by transportation as the top was cover with a sponge.  It also was dented in the front.  The power light for Medium level worked only once then it was flown off. So you can't tell if it is working or not until you feel the heat coming out from it. I wanted to ask for an exchange but I couldn't find how to do so in the Amazon's website there is only return option but I want to keep it, just want to change to another one which I hope could be in a better condition.

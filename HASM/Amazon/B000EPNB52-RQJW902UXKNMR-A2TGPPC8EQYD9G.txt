Title: Love it
Content:
I love my i-pod. I have had it for 2 years now and I still consider it one of the best purchases I have ever made. I work in landscaping and I also own two horses which means I spend a lot of time outside. I have subjected this i-pod to everything. From dropping it in water buckets to running it over with my truck and dropping it on pavement repeatedly (accidentally of course.) 
It still works beautifully and I would not trade it for anything. It is very scratched but that is my own fault.
I would recommend this product to anyone who leads an active life style but doesn't like quiet.

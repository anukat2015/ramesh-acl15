Title: Impressive Heater
Content:
Pros:
Seems hotter then most ceramic/fan forced heaters
Only uses 750w on low
Warmth can be felt at least 6ft away
Thermostat really works
Quiet enough
Tip over switch
Overheat switch
Plastic feels strong & durable
Lightweight
Stays hot for at least 5 minutes after shutdown
Cool to touch (except front guard)
Doesn't dry out a room
Cons:
No remote controlled version
Fan cycling on and off may be a disturbance during sleep
Carrying handle isn't deep enough for a good grip
Glowing heating elements could keep some people awake
It heats a small 10x11 room easily. It raised my room temp from 60F to 71F in 1 hour 30 minutes. The fan noise helps me fall asleep at night, but I can't use the thermostat because the fan cycling on and off instantly wakes me up. During the daytime it does a great job of keeping the desired room temperature. On days when it's around 40F outside I set the heater to keep the room at 70F. It ran for 11 minutes then off for 20 minutes. So I think it's safe to say this heater could save you some $$$ on your electric bill. I can't say how long this heater will last, but I trust Holmes products to last a while. I'll update when a colder day rolls around then I can really test it.

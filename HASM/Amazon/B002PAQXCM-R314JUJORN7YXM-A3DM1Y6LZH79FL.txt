Title: Fast and reliable
Content:
I have to agree with the previous reviewer that this is one superb notebook.  I was also looking for a notebook that is not too large (15" and above) nor too small and underpowered (12" and less).  In the 13" and 14" range, I pretty much narrowed it down to ASUS and Dell Studio XPS 13".  I own a two-year old Dell XPS 13", which had its motherboard replaced twice in two years due to heat issues (this seems to be a very common problem with Dell XPS 13" line and Dell doesn't seem to acknowledge it or actively try to find a solution).  Bestbuy has Dell Studio XPS 13" at about the same price as this ASUS, but with only one-year warranty.  As can be expected, I am hesitant to make a purchase due to my past experience.
ASUS is fast and stable with Windows 7.  The machine looks and feels well built.  Furthermore, the machine stays cool even under heavy use.  The small complaints I have are that it doesn't come with dedicated media keys/buttons, and the keyboard definitely feels different from that of Dell and takes some getting used to.  Certainly, I am not faulting ASUS for these.  A good thing is that you are getting a bargain buying from Amazon.  I was in Taiwan last December - the same ASUS model sold there for roughly US$1,300 - when you would expect a lower price because ASUS is a Taiwanese brand.  I guess Amazon's trade volume must entitle it to a huge discount.

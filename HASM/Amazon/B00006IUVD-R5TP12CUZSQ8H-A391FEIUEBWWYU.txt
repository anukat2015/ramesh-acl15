Title: great little coffeemaker!
Content:
When it arrived, I immediately put it to the test. I filled it with purified water and put my WORST tasting coffee into the permanent filter to see how it would come out. It heats up pretty fast and very hot, unlike my old coffee which you either have to fill with partially hot water or have cold water run through it twice just to make a decent coffee. It makes some noise when brewing, but at least you'll know when it's done! The coffee actually came out surprisingly well, and I must say it tasted better then that coffee i bought from Starbucks a couple days ago. And those were my worst coffee grounds, too... Another pleasant surprise was it's ease of cleaning. I thought the permanent filter would get clogged very easily, but it washed out just fine. 
Overall, a very good little coffeemaker that makes a quick and wonderfully robust cup of coffee. 5 stars!
*an update: after some time, the filter won't sift out the finest grains of coffee bean, so you might have some grit at the bottom of your cup. I would change my rating to 4 because of that, but I can't so I'll just say it here. I use disposable filters now (just stuffing in larger ones works fine) so otherwise, still works great.

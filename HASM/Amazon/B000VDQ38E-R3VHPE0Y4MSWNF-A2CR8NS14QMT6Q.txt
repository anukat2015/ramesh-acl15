Title: A Decent Vacuum for Pet Hair Removal
Content:
This is a very decent vacuum for the price.  I would not consider it lightweight, or quiet. And it is a bit messy when you empty the cannister, but it really sucks up the dog hair, which was my main goal in the vacuum.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase.

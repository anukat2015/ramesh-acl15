Title: NOT the vacuum for carpet!
Content:
Please do NOT buy this vacuum if you need it to vacuum carpet AT ALL! It works well on hard floors only.  Even with the turbo carpet attachment, it picks up only the little surface pieces on the very top of the carpet but will NOT pull anything up out of the carpet like an upright.  If you have hard floors, tile, hardwood, etc., this vacuum works as well as anything else, but for the cost, not worth it if it won't give you any suction on any carpet of any depth.

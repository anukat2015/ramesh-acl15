Title: Terrific little heater
Content:
It may be bright, but at its lowest setting it surely puts out a lot of heat, saving on heating bills!  It only consumes 400 watts on its 'low' setting (800 watts on 'high')and if you're mostly in one room, why heat your whole house when you don't need to?  This also encourages family togetherness since it ocillates.  I have this pedestal one as well as the floor/table model for use on the living room floor.  I just ordered a second pedestal type for another bedroom.  The ocillation feature as well as the remote control are pluses and my cats love it as well!  Can't go wrong by using this fine heater. I happily give it 5 stars.

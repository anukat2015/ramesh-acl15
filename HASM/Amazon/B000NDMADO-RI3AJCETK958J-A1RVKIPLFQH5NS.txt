Title: Love Dyson but this has issues
Content:
I love Dyson, The only complaints I have with this model are:
1.  power cord entirely too short
2. Hose is stiff and could be longer
3.  Hose clips to front of machine, and when you pull it, it moves to the left instead of straight
4.  Canister does not open up with a button to empty
I had to return mine because the power cord was defective, it would not stay in any outlet, and with the cord being too short as it is, it was falling out of the wall to often.
Amazon sent me a return label and I sent it back UPS.  I ordered the DC23 for the same price of $499.  This is the newer version, and I was told the power cord is 5 ft longer and so is the hose, and the canister issues has been changed to that of the upright, press and release.  Waiting for the new one to come!
On a note for Dyson, there is no other vac that sucks up dirt better!

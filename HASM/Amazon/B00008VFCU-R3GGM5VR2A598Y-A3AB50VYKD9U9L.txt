Title: oh my GOD! RCA Please release good firmeware updates fast!!!
Content:
This Unit is awesome it's rather unexpensive, well made, rather small, in short the unit is awesome(reason for that many stars). The real problem is the firmeware... it sucks!Lots of options like playlists are missing.Message to RCA: if you're gonna release a product this late at least make sure it isn't buggy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

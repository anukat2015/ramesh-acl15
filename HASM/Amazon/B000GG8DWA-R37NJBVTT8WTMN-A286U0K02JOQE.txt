Title: Compact, simple and works well
Content:
I have been using this heater practically every day and I am very happy with it. This is probably the most compact quartz heater available and it is very easy to use. There are just two settings low (400 watts) and high (800 watts). Unlike other heaters that heat the air, quartz heaters heat objects and people directly. So, it feels like more heat for less energy. That makes this heater ideal for an open area that would be hard and expensive to heat with those other types of heaters.Also, this heater is very quiet; but you can easily see that it is on from the soothing orange glow it emits.

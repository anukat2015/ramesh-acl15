Title: D 80 to the rescue
Content:
I searched FOREVER to find the right D 80.  Now, don't get me wrong. I love a deal but, when I learned about "gray market" cameras.. I was worried.  Gray Market cameras are very cheap in comparison to the norm.  However, they are made for other countries outside the USA and if you buy and it breaks...NO ONE will want to fix it here.  The warrenty will be for another country.  Do you really trust sending it to ??? and actually get it back.  No dice, friends.  So, I found a factory demo from CAMETA Camera for a good price.  I did get a USA Nikon 90-day warranty, and a Cameta Camera 1 year warranty, plus I just spent another $129.95 for a "diamond" warranty.  The Diamond Warranty covers EVERYTHING from an OOPS issue to a camera malfunction for 3 years.  I can live with that.  I tried the camera and everything is works perfect.  I chose the factory demo because 1-no one really has used the camera.  2-it was checked out and approved for sale 3-the price was about $100 or so less expensive than the new ones. 
One final note - if you go on-line you will see broadway camera and a host of other camera outlet retailing their D80's for $300 to $600 for the body.  DON'T DO IT.  If you go to the BBB.com you'll see a laundry list of complaints.  Not to mention it's ONE company who passed itself off as 15 other companies in order to up-sell you on other equiptment and there is a large possibility that you will NOT get what you paid for.
Buyer Beware.
Cameta Rocks and so does Calumet and Adorama.  
Happy Shooting!

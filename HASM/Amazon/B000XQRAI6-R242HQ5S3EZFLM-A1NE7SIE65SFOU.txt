Title: Powerhouse of Sound
Content:
This is the third one of these I have purchased. I was so happy with mine and my mother's that I bought one for my father's birthday. Can't say he's the most technologically savvy man, but even he likes the ease of the controls.
The battery time seems to differ with everyone, but a 10-12 hour run time is very normal. If you can keep the unit away from heat or cold, you can sometimes get 14 hours. Even 10 hours is incredible for a rechargeable battery, so if you're managing that, you're doing well.
The sound of this MP3 player is superb, and is even better with different earphones. The ones included are very large and do not fit my ears well. I bought some smaller earphones and I was much happier. A great buy and a nice investment for those that need something small with long playback time.

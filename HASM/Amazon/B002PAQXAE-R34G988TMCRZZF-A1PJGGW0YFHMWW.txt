Title: My New Asus UL20A-A1 Laptop
Content:
I work on a computer all day long.  I had bought this one because it was small and lightweight for my massive travelling.  It is so wonderful that I am finding myself using it as my primary computer.  The resolution is outstanding.  It is fast and does not stall the way my other computer did.  The only thing that is a slight problem is the smaller keyboard but I am almost used to that.  I would recommend using a mouse instead of the touch pad.  Otherwise you can't go wrong with this oomputer.

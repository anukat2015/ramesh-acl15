Title: Great coffee, great color
Content:
I upgraded from a small dorm-sized Mr. Coffee with only an on/off switch, so I love the features on this coffeemaker! The only thing I would change so far is the lid on the carafe - it snaps on and off, instead of swiveling like some do, and makes is slightly more messy to clean or fill the carafe with water. Overall great buy

Title: Excellent Camera
Content:
I buy two or three cameras a year.  I hesitated on this camera because it has no image stabilization.  But I recently took it to Europe and got great pictures in churches and museums.  I set the ISO to 800 and had very sharp handheld pictures.  The size is fantastic...very light and small. The live view works great...although the focus is slow.  Focus if very fast in non-live view. To learn all the options, you'd have to spend quite a bit of time. But for most uses, you can learn to use the camera in about 5 minutes.  Menus are very deep, so some options are difficult to keep track of.  But in most competitors at this price level, those deep menued options don't even exist. Highly recommended.

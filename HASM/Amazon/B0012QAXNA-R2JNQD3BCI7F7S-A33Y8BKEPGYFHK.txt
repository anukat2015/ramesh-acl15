Title: New to photography
Content:
If you're a beginner to photography, this is the perfect camera.  I absolutely love it.  You have to get the WR lens to match - it's ALL weather resistant.  That means you don't have to worry about getting caught in bad conditions.  It also runs on batteries.  I love that, because I plan on taking it everywhere on trips and don't have to worry about recharging batteries.  You can pick them up anywhere.  The pictures I've taken so far are exceptional and the features are going to take me into the my passion for taking them for quite some time.  I've taken up a photography class and we went on a field trip for morning close ups...Many people had more expensive cameras like the D90 or Canons.  They where all so afraid of getting a little morning dew on them...hahaha...not me.  I snapped away getting as close to the ground as needed.  Pentax rules. This is a perfect camera to start learning the ins and outs of how cameras work; outside the point and shoot selections.  Get it, use it and enjoy it - ANYWHERE!!!!
Have fun at the sandy beach and rainy days...Also, this thing feels like a little tank compared to the competition in its class. Plus, what a great price. I have ordered everything from Amazon so far and have had absolutely no problems. NEW merchandise and they are FAST!!!

Title: Can't Believe How Much Power This Little Guy Has!  Won't Take Much Space But Making The Room So Warm!!!!
Content:
When I received this, I couldn't believe how small this thing was.  It really doesn't look like it has any power, but I was completely wrong.  It is so powerful and made my room warm so quick.  I am using it in master bedroom (14' X 23') and has plenty power. 
Temperature setting comes from 60 to 85 degrees in 5 degree increments plus "MAX" setting. "Max" is the default setting, so whenever you turn on, it starts on max which is so much better than my old heater where I had to press the button for 5 times to get to the highest temperature.  
Having a remote control is very handy especially in the morning that I don't have to get out the bed to turn on.  It has all the functions on it too (although the display is hard to see from the bed).  Oscillation function is nice to have also. Timer is kinda interesting.  Display only shows 1 hour, 2 hour and 4 hour, but combining these, you can set it up to 7 hours.  
I also purchased a smaller heater made by the same company for my bathroom and this is also a great product (Lasko 754200).

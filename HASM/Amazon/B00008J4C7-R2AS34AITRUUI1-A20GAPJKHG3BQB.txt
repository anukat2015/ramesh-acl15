Title: Don't waist yer time or money!!
Content:
This has almost been a problem from day one.  It seemed like a good choice in the beginning, but there are so many things going wrong with it now.  We've owned this for less than a year and the cord raveler thingy doesn't work and the vacuum shorts out / over heats every couple of days.  This thing is a piece of garbage.

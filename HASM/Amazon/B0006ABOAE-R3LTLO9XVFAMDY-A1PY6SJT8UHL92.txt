Title: So far so good!
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed many good coffees since. I am Italian, and I find the espresso as good as a good espresso prepared with a moka. This is good enough for me, but don't expect a REALLY good espresso, the kind you can have in that special little bar in a hidder corner of an Italian city. I did not have any trouble with leaks anywhere, so far (as some reviewer complained about). Only small complain, the espesso sometimes has a "metallic" flavor coming from the high temperatures reached by the water container. But no big deal, overall I am happy I purchased this product so far.
P.S. I posted the review in May 2007 and I am writing this PS one year later, in April 2008. The machine still works perfectly, with no leaks. I have also used the milk frother several times, and it makes a pretty good cappuccino! Maybe I should upgrade my rating to 5 stars!
P.P.S. In February 2009, everything still works fine!
P.P.P.S. In February 2010, this appliance is still working great. Indeed I tried to update my rating from 4 to 5 stars but the web site doesn't let me do it. Oh, well!

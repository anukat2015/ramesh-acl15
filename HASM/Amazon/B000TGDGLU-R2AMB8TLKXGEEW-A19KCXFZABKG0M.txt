Title: Does not provide much heat at all
Content:
I bought this heater based on all the reviews on this site.  Almost all of them were positive and said that this heater did a great job of heating fairly large rooms.  I put it in a 25x15 room, and it failed miserably.  Even with the heat set at 63, this thing did little to maintain a comfortable temperature.
And its not just that I got a bad one -- I returned my first one b/c I thought it was broken.  Turns out that either they are all broken, or they just don't do much other than heat themselves.
I hope it was just the two that I received.  But I am not trying for a third.  I would not recommend buying this.
*** UPDATED ***
New ones work (yes, I bought two).  I must have just received a bad batch.  I would now recommend this product with 4 stars.

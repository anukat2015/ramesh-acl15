Title: Works for me
Content:
Two issues -- 1) the lid doesn't really ever close all the way because of two extrusions on the inside cover 2) the cover or screen over the web camera came loose after 2 or 3 days (I have yet to ask Dell to fix this as it is under warranty).
Now for the plusses. The built-in web camera has really good resolution. The keyboard is large with a dedicated keypad (a bonus).Intel Core Duo and Win 7 68 bit. 3 USB ports and a 3320GB drive. 4GB RAM.
Would purchase again

Title: sun twin elite 1500 vs. iheater ih-1500
Content:
I bought a sun twin elite 1500 and had the same problem with it not wanting to stay running.  I called the company (not wanting to send it in for repair) and they sent me a heat limit switch (which I replaced) and the problem continued, so I took the new heat limit switch out and just connected the wire together and it stay on now.  I was looking into becoming a dealer for these until I discovered the iHeater IH-1500.  iHeater IH-1500 is the most technically advanced infrared heating system on the market.  The revolutionary iHeater relies on a new technology using a PTC Quartz Titanium Oxide coated metal element.  This is technology similar to that used in commercial spas, generating an even heat that does not deplete your humidity.  Average heating element life is over 60,000 hours, equating to 20 years of operation!  Compare this to the light bulbs that generate heat in other models with an average life of 5,000-20,000 hours.  The element is much less fragile because it has no filament as a bulb does.  This is especially important when moving the unit, as one wrong bump can ruin a bulb.  I now have these in my home and am very pleased with the results.  I am a dealer for these now and have sold over 200 of them with 2 problems that were covered under the 1 Yr. Full Factory Replacement Warranty.  No other brand offers this.  Why pay a markup for a national advertising campaign? iHeater isn't the same
product as the others, including Sun Cloud, EdenPURE, Amish Heaters, etc., and consequently we don't bear the overhead that other companies do. This allows us to deliver 50% more heating capacity than all of the competitors at a lower price.More Heat, Less Money, Better Warrany.

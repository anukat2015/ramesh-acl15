Title: For what it's worth...
Content:
The first day I used this vaccum, I thought it was terrific.  Our old vacuum, a hover Windtunnel (which was no slouch of a vacuum) died on me and I got this one as a replacement.  It removed a LOOOOOTTTT of cat hair from my carpet.  I mean it was scary, I had to empty the cup three times.  It continued to be great the rest of the week, and then...
First, it got all clogged up with cat hair.  This happened several times.  Then the filter dealy got clogged up. And now, it just doesn't work very well.  I can't find any more clogs, but the thing doesn't pick up as much dirt as it used to.  Also, the brush doesn't spin very robustly- it doesn't take much to stop it.  I think something may have fallen off the spindle that drives the belt, because now it's just a bare metal rod that lets the belt slip easily.
I don't know, I might have just gotten a lemon and it may be a great vacuum for other people, but it isn't working too well for me right now.  I'm disappointed with the build quality.

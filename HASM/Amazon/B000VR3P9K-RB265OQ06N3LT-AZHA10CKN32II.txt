Title: Macbook Pro = Excellence
Content:
I recently bought a new Macbook Pro after my old one died (my fault!). I cannot express how much I love this new aluminum (unibody) Macbook pro. The first thing I noticed when I got it was how gorgeous the LED screen was. I mean this is probably the best LCD I've ever seen. The colors are so vibrant and black levels are excellent. Yes, there are times when the glossy screen makes it difficult to see, but unless your always in a very bright room, the benefits of the glossy screen make it a much better screen. Its a pleasure watching 720p movies on this laptop. The 2.4 Ghz Core 2 duo is fast and should provide more than adequate processing power for most people. Its only 5.5 pounds and me being a college student,its very easy to carry around. I mainly chose the Macbook pro over the Macbook due to the screen size and a much better LCD screen. Don't be fooled, just because both screens are LED backlit, the panel is completely different. Overall, If you can afford one, pull the trigger and you will love it and have no regrets buying one. Whether its watching HD movies, gaming, or Photoshop CS4, this powerful laptop can handle it all. Oh and its doesnt get too hot like the earlier macbook Pros

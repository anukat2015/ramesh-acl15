Title: Awesome in every respect
Content:
I bought this camera a couple of days ago and think it is the best piece of equipment that I have ever owned.
No focus problems with this machine... except those caused by the operator.  This is by far the most sophisticated camera I have ever had to learn, but am throughly enjoying the ride.
This camera hasn't improved my "photographic eye" but the photos are technically better than the ones taken with my 20D.

Title: Not impressed but it "looks pretty"
Content:
After reading all of these reviews I ran to my local BJ's wholesale and bought my first Keurig......It was defective.  It vibrated my mug off of it made horrible noises and even worse made terrible weak coffee.  So I took a break.  For mothers day my husband bought me the Keurig B60 to replace my existing Senseo.  The machine does not viberate like the last nor does it make horrible noises but the coffee is still not very good (I tried the variety pack or at least 8 of them.)
On the other hand my Senseo broke after 1 1/2 I called customer service and without any questions they sent me a replacement Senseo and free return shipping.  The coffee tastes 1000 times better also (medium and dark roast mainly the flavored ones not so great).   
It is funny because my family and friends all think I hate strong coffee but the Keurig seems weak to me on the smallest cup setting while using the darkest roasts.
I love my coffee but the Senseo pods (used to be $3.85 not $4.10 at walmart) are twice as cheap, have better customer service (from reviews), and ultimately taste better for less then $70 without a coupon which you can find almost anywhere (e-bay, craigslist etc)  The keurig does look pretty at least while the Senseo just looks like it belongs...at least in my kitchen.

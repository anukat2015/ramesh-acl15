Title: Great product, great company
Content:
This is a great cooling system for the price. It's quiet enough that you can have it running while you're watching TV and not have to crank the volume all the way up. Also, the company that makes the air cooler is easy to work with as well. If there happens to be something wrong with the system, they'll replace it BEFORE you even send back your original system, so you don't have to go without. Very nice and a lot of bang for your buck!     Side note, I live in a non-humid climate, which helps how well it works.

Title: My Apartment is Warm!
Content:
I bought this heater for my on-campus apartment in Boston because the school didn't turn on the heat yet.   Let me tell you, I absolutely love this heater!  It warms up my entire studio apartment in a few minutes and sometimes it's even too hot when I return from classes which is great ... I'd rather be hot than freezing cold in Boston.
Highly recommended!

Title: A Mighty Mouse of a Laptop
Content:
My IdeaPad (Lenovo) Y450 is a little mighty mouse.  It is officially a Lenovo IdeaPad 41892AU model.
I'm still amazed that Lenovo (and other manufacturers) can pack such a complete computer package into such a small laptop shell for such a reasonable price.  I'm not a laptop expert but here is my take on this little beauty.
Mine came with Vista Home (I transferred/upgraded free to Win 7) and a variety of other software titles including the usual 90 day trial stuff from Norton and Microsoft Office.  It has a very good 14 inch backlight HD LED display screen, a nice keyboard touch and layout, tons of connections (for a mouse), good sound for a laptop, and the capability to run any software available today.
Mine came with 4GB of 204-Pin DDR# SODIMM RAM, the max for any 32 bit operating system.  The motherboard has a 2.1Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processory #T6500 with a bus speed of 800MHz and 2M gate.  In other words it cooks right along.  It has a dual layer DVD, Dolby Home Theater premium audio system which is nice for movies, etc.
It has this face recognition password system which allows you to sign onto the system by just sitting in front of it.  That save a few steps and provides good security.  The tiny camera is located at the top of the lid.
It's physique is thin and light, 1.4" and a little over 4 pounds.
About the comments of the touchpad being sensitive I have found in my experience that any laptop touchpad is twitchy.  That is why I use a $10 wireless mouse, and find things go much easier.
In summ, I think this laptop offers a great bang for the buck and I would recommend it for someone looking for a good general use computer/laptop at a decent price.

Title: no more apple
Content:
After having used an iPod mini for about 4 years, I decided it was time to try something else. Because of the unbeatable price of the Sansa Fuze and the nice features, I decided to buy this player - and I'm very happy I did! I added a 8gb microsd card, making it a 16gb player for only about $200.
The quality of the product seems to be very good, and the display does not get scrateches as fast as an iPod does. The display is very clear and bright, so you can even enjoy videos or movies on the Fuze, if you are all right with a small display. The handling is very similar to the iPod, so you will get comfortable with it quickly if you used an iPod previously.
I like being able to listen to FM radio from time to time or record something - that can be quite useful. The only little problem I have with the Fuze is that there are a few minor things in the software i don't like. Overall, however, i would definitely recommend buying the Fuze - it does not always have to be an apple, especially if you can get something better for a lower price!

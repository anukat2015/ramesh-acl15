Title: Delighted: perfect combination of size, weight, performance and value
Content:
Other reviews have gone into the details sufficiently; I'll just say I'm delighted after a few days with this beautiful slim and light. I'll just react to a few points others have made.
- The touch pad: I've learned to play the keyboard like a piano keeping my palms well above the palm rests. I learned this the hard way when typing my name in the initial setup: I must inadvertently have activated the touch pad after typing "G" and now I am forever "G" on this computer rather than "Gary" as it skipped to the next screen. Let that be a warning to you. Now that I've used it a while with palms up it seems fine and probably better for avoiding carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Wireless: very good for me.
- Display: bright and beautiful; I haven't noticed any reflection problems at all, but now that I look I can see they are subtly there but in no way a problem.
- I haven't actually tried it yet, but I know I'll be disappointed at the poor resolution of the webcam: .3 mega pixel. 
- I'm glad I paid the little extra for aluminum and the two-year warranty vs. one-year.
In general it seems to me a perfect combination of size, weight, performance and value. And it is truly a beautiful machine.

I'm still delighted with this great travel companion I've named "Slim". So easy to slip into the perfect case I got: Caselogic PLS-13 Neoprene 13-Inch Neoprene Laptop Sleeve, with a zip pocket for a small Skype headset, USB cable, USB drives, etc. I never need the power cable since the battery lasts so long. I also bought the ASUS USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive SDRW-08D1S-U (Black) which is powered by a double USB cord, so no bulky power cord and transformer. It works just fine for the rare times I need an optical drive. 
On the down side, the web cam is a joke at .3 MP and seems a ridiculous choice for Asus. I use Slim in a variety of lighting conditions, so the face recognition feature only works about half the time and takes long enough that it is generally faster just to log in.  Haven't found the extra software and utilities it comes with of much use. I've learned to work with the touch pad (helps to prop the back up on a book edge to give a more natural angle for my arms), although the touch pad on my Dell Inspiron 9400 is an order of magnitude better. For home office computing, I much prefer the Dell with it's 1920x1200 pixel HD screen and large palm rest area. So "Slim" is no substitute for a work machine for me. But too often I left the Dell home when going out, so I bought Slim for travel and all in all, I'm delighted with it for that purpose.

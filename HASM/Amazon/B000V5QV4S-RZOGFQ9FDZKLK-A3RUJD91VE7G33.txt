Title: Best Bang for the Buck, by far!!!
Content:
This is the Best Bang for your Buck of any of the D-slr out there.  The quality is great, and the build is also wonderful.  Pair it with one of the fine L series lens, like the 17-40 F4 or the 24-105 IS and you have a true Picture taking machine!!! It is basicly a Mark 3 in Pro-Consumer clothes!!!  Blows the pants of all the other brands out there and the image quality is almost the same as a 5D.  The 14bit processing helps give a lot more Color detail and depth to the Photo.  The Guy from Alaska about the Mark 3 was right about the wonderful colors, and the 40D has them as well.  Puts the Nikon D200 to shame, at a fraction of the price!  I got mine From Sal's Camera in La Verne CA since Amazon was on backorder and I am so glad I got it, it is by far the finest camera I have ever used!

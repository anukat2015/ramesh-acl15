Title: Wobbly heater.
Content:
These Lasko tower heaters kick butt, but this thing seems kinda cheap with how wobbly it is. Plus I don't like how every-time you turn it off, it forgets the setting you had it at. I wish it would remember that I want it at low, or at 72 degrees, etc., but instead it always defaults to the hi setting.

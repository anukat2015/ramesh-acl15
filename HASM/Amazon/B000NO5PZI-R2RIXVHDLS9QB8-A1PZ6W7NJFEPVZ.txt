Title: Love it and the price is right
Content:
We decided to buy this model after our old vacuum broke down and we read the reviews. We'll, we love it. It picks up everything, it doesn't scatter debris over the bare floor, the cord reaches all over our first floor, and it does everything we want it to do (although we haven't tried out the attachments yet). And the price is right.

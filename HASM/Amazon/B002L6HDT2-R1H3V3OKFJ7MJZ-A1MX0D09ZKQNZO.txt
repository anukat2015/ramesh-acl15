Title: Uncomfortable to use
Content:
I wanted to get back into running, so this was great motivation. It has a pedometer, which i thought would be cool, but i really don't use that feature that much. It doesn't have AM radio, and i like to hear talk radio on AM. The screen is curved so that makes most screen protectors not fit flush on the left and right edges. It is very tiny, but it feels almost too small, i find the scroll wheel to be awkward since it is so close to the bottom of the ipod. The scroll wheel is also very tiny itself, so it tough to navigate delicately. Battery life is good.

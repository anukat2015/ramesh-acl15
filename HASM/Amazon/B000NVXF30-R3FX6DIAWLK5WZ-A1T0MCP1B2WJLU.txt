Title: Olympus runs with the big dogs.
Content:
This is my first DSLR. I am very happy with the quality. Although the pics don't always look great on the LCD, when you see them on your pc they are amazing. Great to have 10 megapixels. It makes cropped pics clear and not grainy as my old Kodak 3mp camera did. No disrespect to Kodak but a great 3mp pic is still a 3mp pic. Image stabilization has been very helpful. Used it while bouncing around in a safari bus at Disney. I didn't think I would get many keepers but boy was I wrong. Make sure that you read as much about this camera as you can. There are certain settings that aid in the quality quite a bit. Some guy named Wrotniak has a great review and a lot of tips and setting suggestions that I found extremely helpful. Google him, take his advice and have fun.

Title: Great Camera, but a warning to you all...
Content:
I just got this camera and am beyond delighted with it. The quality and clarity of the images it captures are no less than mind-blowing.
However I would like to warn you all of something;
If you are plannning to buy this BECAUSE of the live-screen feature, DON'T!
In buying this, I could do without the live-screen feature, but I fear that there are people planning to buy this camera on the merits of this feature alone. The truth is, using the live-screen feature greatly diminishes the quality of your photos, and the feature is not available in all shooting modes.
If the live-screen feature is a large reason of yours to buy this camera then, I repeat, DO NOT!
If, however, you are purely looking for a very good camera that is worth its price (around $800 now) and can do without the live-screen than go ahed and buy!

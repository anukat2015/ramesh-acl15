Title: first laptop
Content:
its my first laptop, outstanding performance (IE; Start up, overall speed of programs loading, internet speed, features), I am using it more than my desktop. HP is the way to go, I would not dare buy anything but at this point, windows XP is whats on my desk top( its a dinosaur compared to windows 7)I cant even up grade to windows 7 on my desk top from XP, to many scary messages come up because its 32 bit. The Hp get 5 and 1/2 stars

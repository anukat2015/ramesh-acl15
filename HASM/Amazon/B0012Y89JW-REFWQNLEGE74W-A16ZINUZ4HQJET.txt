Title: Great Camera
Content:
Just purchased the camera and found it to be everything I wanted, and more. Have been using 35 mm cameras for years, as well as the digital cameras. This is a great step above the standard point and shoot cameras, and is very easy to operate and to take advantage of the upgrades. Very easy to use, fantastic photos, especially when using some of the software options out there like PhotoShop. Took over 600 photos while down in Savannah this past month and love the idea of framing the photos while shooting. Highly recommend the camera and can't wait to get a telephoto lense. Wish I would have purchased this as well, but hindsight is a wonderful thing. Looking to upgrade with the 55-200mm lense next. The battery lasts forever!

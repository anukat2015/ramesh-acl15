Title: Dell Inspiron - Competent and Reliable
Content:
I have owned Dells for the past 10 years and have never had one issue with any of their machines. This laptop is no exception. I would recommend the laptop for the average user who isn't a big gamer and isn't working on memory-intensive High Def video editing.

Title: Dangerous overheating after 2 years
Content:
We loved this coffee maker -- until the electrical system went haywire after two years. First the programmable feature wouldn't work, then it refused to turn on manually. Finally (today), when it decided to let us have some coffee, it brewed it so hot that it achieved a rolling boil within the carafe and smoke was pouring out of it! Luckily I was standing nearby and unplugged it before it started a real electrical fire.
You might wonder why I still give it 2 stars after this experience -- for two years, it was the perfect coffee maker!

Title: Completely broken within a year
Content:
I bought this unit and have had it for less than a year.  It has completely stopped working with no hope of salvation.  It would have broken sooner but I've had several periods of weeks where I stopped drinking coffee.  Additionally, it shuts itself off after 2 hours.  When I called the manufacturer about this 2-hour shut off they stated all Mr. Coffee coffee makers are built this way.

Title: great picture taking camera
Content:
I loved my xti but returned due to mislabel by amazon, it was advertised as coming with USM lens but it does not, plus Pentax/Samsung give you more for the money, I was not impressed with Nikon d80 either as it does not have IS and when using zoom in 60-135 range the pics were coming out blurry as hell.

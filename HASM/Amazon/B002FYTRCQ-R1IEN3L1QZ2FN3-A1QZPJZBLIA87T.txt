Title: The BEST Canister Vac ~ Especially for Hard Surface Floors
Content:
After much research on floor cleaners and vacuums, I asked for this vacuum for Christmas. At first, it took a little getting used to maneuvering it around. I have all wood floors throughout the house and this has been a DREAM! It's very light weight, easy to get around, has an awesome adjustable suction feature, love the retractable cord, the two on-board attachments, and quieter than any up right I've ever owned. I never owned a canister before this one and I'm so glad to have gotten this one as my first! The ONLY thing I can say that I wish they had done diff. is the handle on it. It should have been placed on the opposite end of the canister. When I place it on its bottom for storage, it rests on the handle so that I end up lifting it up by the base of the hose when I get it back out to use it. It won't rest on the opposite end. It just seems it was done backwards. This doesn't effect the operation of the vacuum. I just hate lifting it by the hose. For the price, you just can't find a better canister vac. I wouldn't recommend this for dense rugs. It has perfect suction for a shaggy rug, like the one in my kids' play room. I was dreading having hard wood floors throughout the house but now I find every excuse to take this out to use it. I simply couldn't be happier and you're sure to like this one, too! I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!

Title: Good vacuum, filter not permanent
Content:
This vacuum seems to be the cheapest way to get a HEPA cleaner. It does fine, but the filter in the canister has to be replaced every year according to the manual (and in my experience), in contrast to what the amazon reviewer says. Expect to pay about 1/4 the sale price to replace the internal filter, and another 1/10 for the micro-filter (that you need to really get the allergens out).
Mine came with an adjustable roller head, though the adjustment was fairly minute. It is very loud, and has lots of suction power. I do note that the roller head has to be taken off to pick up moderate-sized dirt.
Cleaning has to be done outside, it's true, but anyone with allergens won't be cleaning their filters or replacing their bags inside anyway.

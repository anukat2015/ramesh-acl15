Title: So far the best notebook from Acer
Content:
So far this is the best notebook by Acer. The 8 hour battery life attracted me. It sure does last long. The design is sleek and nice. It is light and thin. I recommend that anyone who plans to purchase to opt for the fastest processor. Only thing I regret is that I purchased mine before the release of Windows 7. Mine has Vista but still is an awesome machine.

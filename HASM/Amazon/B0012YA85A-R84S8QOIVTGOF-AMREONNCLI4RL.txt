Title: Canon EOS Rebel Xsi
Content:
I love my new Canon EOS Xsi. With the new SLR, it was curious that the new 3" screen was showing you the camera settings rather than the image you were shooting, like with point and shoot cameras. Only with "Live View" will you see the images on the screen as you photograph. It doesn't matter. Since it's a SLR, you view your shot through the viewfinder, which has elaborate information you can see. Frankly, the screen on point and shoot cameras were impossible to see and you could never tell what you were getting on them anyway. The SLR lets you know exactly what you are getting by looking through the lens that is taking the shot.
I got a great deal on my 12.2 mpx EOS at Amazon, and I would urge anyone looking for a more serious camera than a point-and-shoot should jump in and make the plunge with this very excellent DSLR.

Title: This has grown on me
Content:
This is my third iPod. I replaced my 3g nano (4GB) for an 8GB only because I ran out of room.  For some reason, I prefer the short squatty size of the 3G, but the thin size can grow on me.  In the past, I have only used the iPod for music playback and for calendar and contacts, and I assume the change in size was to optimize the screen for video.  Initially, I found the screen flow feature and the shake/shuffle feature to be annoying.  Once I realized I can turn these off as needed, I am back on the happy train with this thing.  I am a huge fan of the Genius feature in iTunes, and am glad it was modified to be put on the iPod.

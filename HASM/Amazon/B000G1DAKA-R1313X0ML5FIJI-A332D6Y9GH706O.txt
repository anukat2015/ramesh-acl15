Title: Excellent Bargain on one's first DLSR
Content:
This was my my first DLSR.
Pentax made the transition clean and effortless with the K100D.
It has enough auto features and modes to make things easy for one coming from P&S's plus all the Control an exerienced Photgrapher could want.
All this and it can take ANY K mount lens and work in Manual mode with any of them plus it can work fully auto with the AF ones.
The 18-55mm kit lens was a big surprise, lotta quality for very little cash!

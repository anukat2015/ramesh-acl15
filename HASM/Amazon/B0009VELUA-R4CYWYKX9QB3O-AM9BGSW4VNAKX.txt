Title: great machine
Content:
This machine is great for our small office.  Even has a special setting for 1-4 cups of coffee where it heats the water twice for better coffee.  My only problem is that the entire lid has to flip up when putting in the coffee and water, and then for cleaning.  If you have it under a cabinet, you must pull it out to do so.  Others talked about water overflow, and we only noticed that one time when the water was poured in too fast.  I think it's a relief valve of sorts.  Otherwise, very convenient and no smelly pots on the burner.

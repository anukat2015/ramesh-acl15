Title: Easy to use, but poor reliability
Content:
We had this machine for about two months and it was great when it was working but eventually we started getting an error message that the door was not closed even though it was. I was able to reset it once by unplugging it for a few hours and plugging it in again, but a few days later we got the same error message. 
We had a Jura Capresso F7 before this and ending up returning two of those because similar problems before purchasing this machine. These new automatic machines are easy to use and make great espresso, but it seems like the technology is still pretty buggy so beware.

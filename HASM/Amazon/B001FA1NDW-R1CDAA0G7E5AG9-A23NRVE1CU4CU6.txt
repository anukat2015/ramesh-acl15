Title: Great buy!
Content:
I bought it for like $135 without any tax added on. If you buy it from apple, the total cost comes upto like $158. The only advantage of buying from Apple is that you can get custom engraving and a gift wrap. But I didn't need either and so bought it cheap here. the iPod as usual is great.

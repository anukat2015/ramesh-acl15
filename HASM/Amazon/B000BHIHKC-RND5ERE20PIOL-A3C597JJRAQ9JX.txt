Title: Coffee not strong enough
Content:
We have tried numerous brands and types of coffee pods, but so far the only one that has delivered any flavor is Senseo Cappuccino. Other pods seem to taste watered down. We are not strong coffee drinkers and yet the coffee from this machine with Home Craft pods seems to taste weak and watery.

Title: This vacuum sucks.
Content:
Coming from places foreign, we were used to and wanted a canister vacuum: they are much easier to manoeuvre, particularly for use on stairs. We'd heard from a friend some bad things about canister vacuums in the US being unreliable or ridiculously expensive, and that the Dyson was a good option. So far, it's been good for us too. It's easy to move around, sucks strongly and reliably, and is easy to empty cleanly with just a couple of clicks of buttons, despite being bagless. You can't tell that it's been reconditioned: every seems as if it were new.
My only gripes would be the hose, which has a tendency to twist and should have had some sort of swivel built into it (although this is no doubt made tricky by the fact that the hose also contains electrical power for the brushes in the head), and the power cord, which is a bit too short. The latter problem is now fixed simply by using it in conjunction with a 40 ft extension lead, so we can get round a whole floor without needing to change wall sockets. 
And to top it all off, the Dyson looks good too: this is one vacuum that I wouldn't be embarrased to have sitting around when visitors turn up unexpectedly.

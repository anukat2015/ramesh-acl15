Title: Fantastic Style, Great Coffee
Content:
I LOVE this coffee maker!  I bought it from www.smartcafe.ca in Canada for $99 and it's worth every penny.  I have been using the My Invento pods which brew a really nice, strong dark cup of coffee with a rich, frothy crema.   It allows you to select a very "short" cup which is nearly Espresso or a very "long" cup of about 7 oz.  It's a sliding-switch option so you get to choose everything in between, too.  Warm-up is very fast.  The coffee maker itself is gorgeous; very sleek and modern.  I bought the Pearl finish which looks fantastic with all the stainless steel appliances in my new kitchen.    Clean up could not be more simple or easy.   All in all this is a 5-star plus unit.

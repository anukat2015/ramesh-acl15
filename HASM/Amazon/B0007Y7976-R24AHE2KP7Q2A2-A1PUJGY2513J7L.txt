Title: A great item!
Content:
This is my first experience with any type of ipod device. Downloading music onto it is a breeze as well as removing the ones you might change your mind about later, although getting pictures onto it has been challenging. However, the manual is in .pdf form and is quite helpful. There are games, a calendar and lots of other goodies. It's a combination of a Palm and MP3 in one in many ways.
The sound quality is phenomenal and while you listen, it is though the artist is right next to you. Not bad for 2GB and 500 songs! 
Downloading free podcasts from the iTunes store is also a nice feature, whether you want to learn Spanish or famous speeches. Although the Nano does not have video capacity, you can download video podcasts that you can watch on your computer, just as though it were on Windows Media Player and then erase them as you go.
Overall, this is a great value for your money. Enjoy.

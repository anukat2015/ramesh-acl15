Title: EL7020A review
Content:
Bought based on Consumer Reports reviews. Have only had for a month, but works great, is well designed, and unlike what I expected from CU review, it is not noisy to me (possibly because of the comparison to our older Panasonic). 
At least after a month, highly recommended.

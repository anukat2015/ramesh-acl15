Title: Very poor service
Content:
I sent this product back for repair because 2 of the 3 USB ports did not work.  I was told it was not covered because the "Mother Board" was damaged.  I indicated the PC NEVER worked since I got it and I was told they could do nothing.  The unit still had the protective plastic on it and I DID NOT abuse it.  From my perspective their Customer Support is terrible and I would never buy from them again. I bought direct from HP.
.....Just my opnion

Title: Hot little buy!
Content:
What a nice little heater! This winter has been cold in Florida, and my bedroom does not seem to warm up. I was waking up throughout the night and feeling like I was in a freezer. I ran around to all the local stores looking for a space heater and everyone was sold out. My daughter suggested I try Amazon (why didn't I think of that first?!) and this was the exact heater for which I had been searching. Great price, fast shipping, and now a cozy room at night. It really does a great job at creating warmth (my Chihuahuas love it, too!) and is stylish to boot. I highly recommend the Lasko 6410!

Title: Thermostat Has Never Worked
Content:
I purchased this unit off season -so I paid a fraction of the 39.99 being asked here.
The thermostat has never worked on the unit -only the continuous HI / LO settings.  (I got sick, forgot about it and the 30 days to return it expired -never thought about the warranty).  I use this unit in a rarely used 4X6 bathroom.  This unit is cumbersome, fat and not easy to grip to pick up and transport to another space.  So, even though the functions are not all operable, I've found a practical use for it.  The unit is relatively quiet -much quieter than their HFH442. It would probably be a very useful unit if the thermostat were operable.

Title: This Bunn may last my lifetime
Content:
About 15 years ago, I purchased a Bunn home duty coffee maker and found it to be excellent.  After about 5 years of nearly daily use, it started to get a little finicky so I took it apart in an attempt to clean the hot water chamber.  Turned out the sealing parts are not really made to be taken apart after 5 years of use and then go back together.
In a quest for a new Bunn, I found that the VPR cost about double what the home version cost so....  10 years later, the Bunn VPR is still going strong and has helped out at family events serving large groups of people (just what the machine is designed for!).  Despite having water poured into the bottom heat plate (don't try to pour water in without a carafe in place), it still works perfectly!
A hint to those who make coffee only on the weekends:  the design of the Bunn is that it is a small hot water tank and keeps a couple gallons of water hot and ready to go at all times.  This will use some electricity and I've taken to putting a towel over the top of mine to help insulate and lower energy usage.  Additionally, being hot all the time, water will evaporate.  If going more than a couple days without making coffee, it's best to pour a pitcher of water in (with the filter basket empty and a carafe ready to catch the hot water) to top off the tank and then make a pot with coffee after it has reheated the reservoir.
If by some Act of God, my Bunn stops working, I will not hesitate to purchase another Commercial Bunn for what is essentially personal, home use.  If you love coffee and can tolerate the price, this is a great choice for a coffee brewer!

Title: Did not meet my expectations
Content:
I purchased this product because I thought it would be better than using a mop on my vinyl flooring.  I was wrong.  This machine does not dry vacuum well.  It blew the dirt, etc. around instead of sucking it up.  The wet side works for a while, then before I can get all my vinyl flooring done, the suction stops working.  I read on the bissell website that this could be due to the fact that the filter is wet.  Duh!  The filter is going to get wet!  I also had problems with water squirting out of the dirty water tank while I was dry vacuuming.  I had high hopes for this product.  I could vacuum and mop with heated water with one machine.  This product was a waste of money.  I will go back to my mop until I find something that works better.  I gave it two stars because the idea of using one machine to vacuum and mop is a good concept but this product needs some fine tuning.

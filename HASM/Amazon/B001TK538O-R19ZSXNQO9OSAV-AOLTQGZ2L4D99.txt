Title: Very fast and easy to use...
Content:
I absolutely love it! Within a minute you have a hot fresh cup of coffee...we also bought the reusable filter for loose leaf tea and that works very well.
I have no complaints...quick, easy and convenient. I used to buy the refills at Bed Bath Beyond...now my grocery store sells them!
We use this 2-3 times per day.

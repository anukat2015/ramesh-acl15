Title: No customer support from Keurig
Content:
Good luck getting Keurig to follow through on warranty problems. I purchased this machine on 1/6/10, and on 1/20/10 it quit transferring water from the outside tank into the brewer. Called Keurig on Thursday 1/21, Friday 1/22, Monday 1/25, and Tuesday 1/23 all with the same results. " Gee we're sorry, but the techs are busy and we promise someone will call you back tomorrow." Obviously the call backs never happen. So here I sit with  broken brewer, and no way of returning it for one that works. I HIGHLY recommend that if you are seriously considering buying this brand, that you do so a "brick and mortar" actual store, so that you can psychically take it back for a refund. Even if I had purchsed it directly from Keurig and returned it during the first 30 days, I'd still be stuck with return shipping. VERY diappointed with Keurig, and their lack of customer support.  
Edit:   After posting this here, and sending a copy to Keurig, I was contacted by customer support. They have shipped a NEW replacement brewer. Happy now.

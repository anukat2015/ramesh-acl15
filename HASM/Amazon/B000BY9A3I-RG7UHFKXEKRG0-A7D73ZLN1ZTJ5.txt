Title: WOW    way better than expected !
Content:
I just got this vacuum a few days ago.  I was a bit skeptical when I opened the box, its much smaller and lighter than my heavy old eletrolux that had just died before I ordered this one, but it was here and I needed to vacuum the house, so I figured I may as well take it for a test drive. Assembly was a breeze just plug in the hose, snap on the wand and cleaning head. I did the carpet in my living room first, and was impressed with how much power it had.  I stopped to read the instructions on how to empty it and tried that too. Very easy just press a button and lift it out,  press another button  and it opens to empty. I was shocked to see how much it had already picked up ! After that I went ahead and did the whole house. I really like that the variable power control is on the handle and not the canister, the tools and heads are easy to change, and the cord rewinds with the touch of a button.  I'm glad I picked this one, its easier to use and picks up even better than my old vacuum. One minor drawback the container that traps the dirt is fairly small and will have to be emptied everytime its used, but its so quick and easy to do , I don't think thats a big deal.

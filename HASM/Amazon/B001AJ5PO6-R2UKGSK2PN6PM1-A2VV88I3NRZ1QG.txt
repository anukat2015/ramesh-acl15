Title: The Toshiba A-215 has been great (for over a year now)
Content:
I have had my Toshiba a-215-s5837 now for a year and a few months. I've never had any problems with it. Even running Vista, which most of my friends seem to hate. I use the laptop for work about 9 hours a day and it still works almost as well as new. Wireless seems to have good range compared to my older wireless cards. The Video playback far exceeds the video playback on my 2.8 ghz P4 Dell desktop. The only thing I don't like about it, is that the glare is pretty bad if you try to use it outdoors or in a car. But, the same can be said for 99% of the rest of the laptops out there, so it's a minor complaint. I used to do PC support for a living, and this is the most reliable computer (laptop or desktop) that I have ever owned. In all likelihood, my next laptop will be a Toshiba.

Title: Great photo quality, poor video features.
Content:
This camera is near perfect.  My description of the camera is that it is a great for photos, but has poor video features.
THE GOOD: For taking pictures fast this camera is amazing.  The clarity of pictures is also superb.  My pictures come out looking pro almost every time.  I could not be happier than I am with the photo quality of this camera. Also, this camera feels really well built.  It Feels sturdy and feels great in my hands.
THE BAD: If you were making the choice to buy this camera because it has high def video capability, you should think again.  You can focus before you start the shoot automatically; however, once you start to shoot, if you want to change focus you have to do so manually which can make for some blurry sections of video.  Again, there is no autofocus mode on this camera which was a little surprising to me because in other ways this camera is so well perfect
Overall; however, I am still very pleased with this camera.

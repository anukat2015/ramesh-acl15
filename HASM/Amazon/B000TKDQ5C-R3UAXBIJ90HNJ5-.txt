Title: Okay for the money
Content:
This unit does not have a safety switch so when it gets knocked over it will shut down. So be very careful where you put it. Also it seemd to need to be shut down and plug pulled to reset for what every reason when it stops working. (per manufacturer instructions). I used to have a very good heater made by Lifetime which was the best until it finally broke after 5 years of service. I tried this one but was not happy.

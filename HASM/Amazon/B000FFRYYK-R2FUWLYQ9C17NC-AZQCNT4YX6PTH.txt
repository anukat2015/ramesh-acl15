Title: Great price for this Bunn
Content:
This is a great coffee maker, we are very happy with it.  This is also the best price I have found, and we have looked all over.  The stainless steel carafe is great for keeping the coffee fresh for hours.  The only drawback is, there are no markers for how much water to put in for anything less than 10 cups.  It's just some guesswork.  Other than that, this is really an ideal coffee maker.

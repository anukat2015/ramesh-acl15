Title: Great, Quiet Heater - Perfect for my office
Content:
Thanks to the previous reviewers, I decided to order this space heater... the only thing not provided in the description was an approximation of how big the space heater is... it's quite small. It stands just about a foot tall and maybe 8 or 9 inches wide... It's discrete enough to hide under my desk at work but powerful enough to heat my entire office. It's quiet, too, even on the high setting. I'd recommend this to anyone.

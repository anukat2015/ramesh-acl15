Title: Perfect for travel and great battery life
Content:
I bought this to be a take along with me and be able to use on my lap.  I use it mostly for for connecting to the internet and getting email. The over look is nice.  The battery last well over 6+ hours with constant use and it blends nicely into the back of the notebook.  The Intel Core2 Solo ULV SU3500 Processor is a very nice improvement.  A friend of mine bought the Aspire One with the Z520 and it is not near as snappy or capable of handling multiple applications.  Now it will not handle video editing but it can handle Photoshop reasonably well.  Overall it is well worth the additional $$$.   One minor complaint is the keyboard.  I find it requires a heavier amount of key pressure than most keyboards.  Also I would have like a more tapered key instead of all flat keys that require a hard strike to register.  All said the keyboard requires getting use to.

Title: I sent mine back
Content:
I used it to heat water for tea and instant coffee.  The first time I used it, I filled it about 1/3 full, and there was horrible brown stuff up to the water line.  I washed it very well and used it again, filling it a little higher this time.  The discoloration was bad, but not quite as bad - you could see both lines.  After calling the company and being told I should return it to the "store", I went online and Amazon immediately sent me the shipping label and it was returned for free.  I love Amazon.  I would not buy this again.  Now I have to find a proper pot for keeping water hot for a whole day.

Title: A lot of bang for the buck
Content:
I read all the reviews before finally deciding on this model for my girls rooms.  After the first use, my girls couldn't be happier, or toastier.  I am very pleased with its efficiency and performance.  So far, they've only needed to use setting 1, which puts out tremendous heat, can't imagine needing setting 2.  The thermostat is a definite plus and performs as it was meant to.  Other reviews noted that it was 'noisy' to use in a bedroom, I haven't found this to be true.  The fan is very quiet, even for a light sleeper. I highly recommend this model, you get a lot of bang for the buck.

Title: Happy Anniversary Gift!
Content:
For our 32nd anniversary my husband purchased this camera for me. It is one of the best gifts he has ever gotten me.  I love it.  I find myself stopping on the side of the road to take pictures, something I have never done.  It is so easy to use and it takes the clearest pictures.  I am not a camera buff but I can now take professional shots.  We have several small digital cameras, and I took terrible pictures because they are very hard to hold still.  This camera has enough weight to help steady your hand and yet light enough to carry all day.
Great Camera!!!

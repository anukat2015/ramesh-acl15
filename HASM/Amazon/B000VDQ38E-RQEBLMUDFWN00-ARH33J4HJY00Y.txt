Title: Gets the pet hair and so much more!
Content:
A friend at work got one of these vacuums and told me how much it helped get the pet hair at her house.  I got mine and was really shocked at how much "stuff" it picked up!  And there I thought I was a decent housekeeper.  I guess the only problem was that I had to empty the cup after every room, but hopefully that will improve after a couple of deep cleanings!  And no icky bags spewing dust all over everything when you change them!  It was a little challenging to put together, but I'm kind of "printed directions-challenged"  I was able to do it almost all by myself, though the pictures and printed directions were a little confusing to hubby and me. I also used the upholstery attachment and that worked well on the couch!  The price through Amazon was less expensive that anywhere locally, plus it qualified for free shipping when I bought it.  I'd recommend this one.

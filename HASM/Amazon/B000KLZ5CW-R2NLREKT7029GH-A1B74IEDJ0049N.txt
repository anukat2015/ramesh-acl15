Title: what is, but isn't?!
Content:
My wife and I were really anticipating the arrival of our new portable a/c unit during an extra humid stretch.  When the Whynter arrived it had some exterior damage.  It took weeks to get parts and I learned that there was no service network just their home office in California.  This became an issue several weeks later when the unit started to howl when the compressor kicked in, then shortly afterward the compressor stopped altogether.  The unit was never very quiet and the cooling effect did not seem up to our expectations. We have learned in comparison with a subsequent 14,000 unit of a different brand that the performance of the Whynter was, in fact, sub par.
When we eventually got the repaired unit back, it was damaged to the point of major panels hanging unattached and electronics dangling from wires.   
Had to send it back and this time it took until February to get it returned, again in pieces.  Whynter had packaged the unit very poorly and did not insure the shipments.  When I pressed for some replacement they stopped responding to emails and phone calls entirely.  I had communicated with them in a very patient, calm and proper manner.  To this day they have not responded to my communications.  I have a broken a/c  with a warranty but no cool air to be found.   
I write this review so that others may be potentially spared of a repeat experience.

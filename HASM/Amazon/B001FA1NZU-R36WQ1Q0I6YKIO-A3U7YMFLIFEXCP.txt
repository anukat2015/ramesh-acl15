Title: Great fun, but..
Content:
This is a such great product.I bought the itouch 8 gb and really have enjoyed all the possibilities, especially with the apps. Downloaded podcasts to listen to on 8 hour trip to beach. The 'but' is you may want to consider getting 16 or 32 GB. I have already loaded mine up and have to be selective now...also headphones not the greatest quality.

Title: Didn't work as expected
Content:
I was a little disappointed in this product, after seeing all of the rave reviews that it got.  What we have is a brick house that is a little cold in the winter.  I wanted something to help heat the living room, so we didn't have to fire the furnace constantly.  The living room is about 15x20 with one end open to the stairs and dining room.  I think this is the problem.  This heater didn't put out enough heat to even create a noticable difference in this room.  Should it have?  I don't know.  In all fairness we tried several different types of heaters (ceramic and convection) and they didn't do the job either.  Even an Edenpure heater did nothing.  But I was hoping that with the reviews that this heater got, that it would have been the one to work.  It wasn't.  Maybe it would work much better in a smaller room that didn't have big openings like the living room does.  Don't know because I returned the product.

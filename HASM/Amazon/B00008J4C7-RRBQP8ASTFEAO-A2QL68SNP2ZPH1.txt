Title: You get what you pay for?
Content:
We barely had this out of the box before we realized we should return it. The retractable cord didn't retract, for one thing, even  after trying all the tricks in the book for that problem.  In general though, we knew it was a cheap vacuum, but we didn't epect the parts and attachments to really seem *this* cheap.  It seemed more like a toy vacuum than something really serviceable.

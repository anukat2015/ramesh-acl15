Title: Super portable computing
Content:
I bought this netbook to keep in my backpack at all times for email and web opportunities while I'm out and about.  Other netbooks seem to suffer a bit from spec bloat- bigger drives, more memory, higher prices.  
Pros-
1. Small and light.  Really light.  I also have the eee pc 1000h.  The difference is dramatic.
2. Given it's size, keyboard is ok.  
3. On a purely personal note, the blue color is great.
4. Cheap, cheap, cheap.  I picked mine up for $309.  Other comparable netbooks seem to be up over $400.  
5. I really like the Linux operating system.  Its more like a PDA's. Lots of apps are included.  Upgrading to latest versions looks easy.
6. Quiet
7. Very fast boot
8. Second SD slot that adds to drive size is a cool idea.  Now if 16 or 32gb SD card prices would just come down, things would be great.  I have lots of media files on SD's for other devices, I can plug them in and still have one free.
9. After seeing the 7" screens, I think the 8.9" is as small as you can go and still have it useful
10. Total travel package is really light.  Small, light power brick and cord.
Negs-
1. Battery life is good, but would be amazing with a 6-cell
2. Shiny- get used to lots of fingerprints.  Would have been much better matte.
3. Included sleeve will protect from scratches, but not much else.  No padding, no zipper- just basically a plastic pocket.  I'm  looking for an aftermarket sleeve.
Because of it's specs its more of a net appliance than notebook.  But if you're looking for a cheap way to use hotspots and apps that don't require lots of resources, this is great.

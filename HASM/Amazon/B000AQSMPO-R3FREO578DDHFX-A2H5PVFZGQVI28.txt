Title: 2 In 2 weeks Both dead
Content:
I bought the first one and loved it until it stopped working. It seems that the pump won't fill the reservoir so when it heats up it just shuts down. I would guess this happened after 20 cups brewed. I brought it back and went to another store who had it cheaper and the same thing happened after 3 days, about 15 cups of coffee. I called customer service to see what was going on and I was told the I would get a call back ib 24 to 48 hours. So it's going back and I'll look for something better.

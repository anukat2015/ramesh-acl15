Title: Nice and convenient but crashed after two days
Content:
The ipod crashed, and then it also infected my computer with some type of virus or conflictual software. Then my computer crashed so I had to restore it entirely (with hp unable to ship me a restoration cd for my media center for over a month) and reload all the software additions and updates that I had installed on it for over a year. Overall, looks like a great device, but for me was just a terrible experience. I ended up returning it and getting a refund. Amazon customer service is the one perfect thing in online buying...

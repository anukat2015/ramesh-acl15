Title: Vacuum Cleaner Blues
Content:
Complained long enough about problems dusting with my upright cleaner to convince my husband to get me a new canister cleaner, so excited, I am gong to have a sparkling house, but voila, the dust brush is doll house size!  It definitely is not for speed dusting and the area of the brush is so small! and the bristles are stiff, doesn't look furniture friendly - oh for a big round brush with soft bristles, but when I tried to find out if another attachment is available got nowhere.  The suction is great, easy to move about, only other drawback, a temporary one, is that you have to search for the controls, black on black, ok after you learn them.

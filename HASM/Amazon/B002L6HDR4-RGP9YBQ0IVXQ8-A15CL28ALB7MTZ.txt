Title: What a great device
Content:
What can I say?  Very cool.  I love that it has an accelerometer in it.  I thought that might be limited to the iPod Touch.  
This model is so handy and portable.  Compared to the iPod Touch, this model feels like it can take a little bit more of a beating and keep on ticking.  
The Touch feels a little fragile, probably because there's so much glass to it.  Seems like the nano could withstand a drop better, but I don't every want to find out.

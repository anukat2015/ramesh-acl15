Title: No other way to go!
Content:
It took me a fairly long time to jump on the iPhone/iPod Touch bus, but I see now that I was MISSING OUT!  I never leave anywhere without this thing and it's become a fully integrated part of my life.  Although it seems spendy, I personally believe the 64gb version is worth every penny.  You get it here on Amazon for almost $50 less than your standard Apple retailer and the space IS valuable.  Between Music, TV Shows, Movies, Apps, and anything else you could want - the 64gb version is the best bang-for-the-buck.  Don't be cheap and get 32gb for $100 less. You'll kick yourself when you fill that up in a week and get stuck with NO way to expand it!  Dive in and get one of these units: You can't go wrong.

Title: Great Camera at a Great Price
Content:
This is a solid camera. Feels great in the hands and takes pretty pictures. The viewfinder is a little dim and focusing can be tricky at times with the included lenses. The menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are layed out very well. It is a good camera for novice and pros alike.

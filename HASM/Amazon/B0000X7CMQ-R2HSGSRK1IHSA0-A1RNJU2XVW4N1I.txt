Title: Coffee maker
Content:
We like the coffeemaker fine. None of the problems in the reviews we read are really that problematic.  I was surprised that the coffeemaker itself is made of pretty light-weight plastic. It doesn't have the quality feel that my Barista or the Cusinart coffeemakers have. Only time will tell whether it will hold up to the others.  The coffee is fine though.  I don't love the lid with plastic topper but can live with it. I would still prefer to have a Barista like my last coffeemaker if they were still making them. It was awesome.

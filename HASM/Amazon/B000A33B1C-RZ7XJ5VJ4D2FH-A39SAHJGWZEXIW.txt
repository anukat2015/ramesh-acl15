Title: Terrific DeLonghi Heater
Content:
This is a great space heater.  It doesn't make any noise (no fan).  It has a programmable dial on it in 15 minute increments, so you can set it to turn on and off during your day and night.  We heat with oil and because of the sharp spike in oil prices, we were looking for another source of heat.   This works out perfectly.  I highly recommend it.  And I got it at a great price from Amazon, and free shipping charges.  How can you beat that??

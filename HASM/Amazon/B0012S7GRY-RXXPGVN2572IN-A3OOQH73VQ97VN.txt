Title: Cool, User-friendly
Content:
The color is cool. And it is user-friendly, fits nicely into any pocket. Earbuds is ok, sound quality acceptable and overall feel is excellent. But for video playback, the screen is a bit small. Great for carrying this around. I wanted another Creative Zen but it does not offer pink and other colors.

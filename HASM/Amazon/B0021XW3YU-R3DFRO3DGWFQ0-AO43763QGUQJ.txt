Title: Great features, not as nice construction.
Content:
For $129.00, you can't beat the feature set included in this camera.  Great zoom and color in the pictures.  The worst problem I've had is the lag time between depressing the button and it taking the picture in the automatic mode.  I have had great luck with Kodak cameras (except my last one was stolen with a year's worth of pictures in it still).

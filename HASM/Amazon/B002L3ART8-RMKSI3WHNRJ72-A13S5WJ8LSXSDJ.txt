Title: Exceptional Quality
Content:
Purchased this vacuum cleaner about a month ago and use it almost daily. I already had 4 canister vacuum cleaners of different brands because I use one each for the upstairs, downstairs, basement and garage, and one needed to be retired. Our entire house (including finished full basement) has either solid wood or tile floors - with a lot of Persian rugs everywhere. I do not own a vacuum cleaner with a power brush head because I do not want to beat and scratch the wood floors. This Electrolux was designed to be used on solid floors and area rugs. It is very quiet, significant suction, lots of features and the build quality is outstanding. It was made in Hungary. It is far the best vacuum I now own and will be buying another one or two. The old vacuums will be given away.

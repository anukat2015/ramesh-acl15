Title: DeLonghi-ing for a better Machine: Read this before you buy!
Content:
A jumble of errors led to my wife and I owning not one but TWO horrid DeLonghi machines. The first one was a lower model bought at Target. I programmed it and set it up, so far, so good. Coffee was OK and the machine worked (coffee could have been hotter) About 2 weeks into it I noticed the display would fog up with vapor every time we used it. Then I noticed that the hot plate fell in so that it no longer touched the glass carafe. It was impossible to repair because a regular screw driver won't open the base. So we tossed it (the box and receipt were long gone, because my last coffee maker lasted 10 years)My wife announced that she was going to buy the next one from the Starbucks by her office. She came home with the model above. I was a little concerned because it was the same brand. These guys are very slippery, the box says "designed in Italy" but if you look it says "Manufactured in the PRC" Peoples Republic of China! We had all the same overflow problems, and programming issues everyone else had, and the tepid coffee too! This is a very poorly concieved product. We returned it and I now intend to by a European machine, or a good old Mr. Coffee. Could not be worse!

Title: An excelent piece of work
Content:
I can not regaurd this camera Highly enough.  The pictures I take are all gorgeous.  After monthes of slogging through the net looking for what was right for me, I ended up going with one of my original choices.The rebel has become sort of a friend between me and my internet friends.  The quality of my photography and my photomanipulation persuits has improved immesureably.  I love the low ISO grain the camera has and full control over settings.  Its got pretty much everythign a budding photographyer like me needs.  Now I just need to get some better glass for it.
Go buy one!

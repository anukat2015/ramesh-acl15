Title: Almost TOO good!
Content:
It's more than powerful enough as an under-desk heater. From 10 ft. away you can feel the heat from the unit itself in a regular room. From farther away it heats up a bedroom-sized room in about an hour. It does make metallic expansion sounds as it heats up but it's not annoying. Works great. Worth the extra money.

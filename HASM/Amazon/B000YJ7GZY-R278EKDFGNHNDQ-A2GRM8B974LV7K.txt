Title: Cool Tablet, Bro
Content:
Bought this refurbished, and everything was as specified.  It plays TF2 and L4D well enough though it has such a small pale screen.  Has 4GB ram which is a lot for a laptop.  A good tablet and general laptop.
Pros:
Wacom Penabled tablet with an eraser
Vista Ultimate
Small and Light
Can play games in a pinch
Touchpad can be disabled
Cons:
Spacebar is flimsy
Screen is pale
Other thoughts:
I thought it would run hotter after reading so many complaints.  I should buy a better battery for it.

Title: Life's too short to compromise on your coffee!
Content:
While visiting my brother, and sibling java heads, I discovered Keurig's version of a great fresh cup of coffee.  Now I have purchased my own, the Keurig B-60 Special Edition Gourmet Single Cup Brewing System.  OK OK so the word 'gourmet' is overused in the industry; however, this really is a superior coffee machine.  There are many delicious blends and coffees, teas, mochas available and it's FRESH, RICH, HOT, and PERKY every time.  I highly recommend this coffee machine for others who enjoy good coffee and are sick of throwing away half pots of stale expensive coffee.  Enjoy!

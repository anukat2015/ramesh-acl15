Title: I hate HP
Content:
My tx1320us has just stopped working and the diagnosis was that my motherboard is dead. I also had never solved problems (Wi-fi stopped working at first, overheating and now this). I went to HP Brazil and they don't do anything, I called HP US and none solution... and now I have nothing. All my work in the computer, lots of work to do, lots of deadlines and no notebook. I'll never buy another HP in my life. never. I can't spend a lot of money trusting that I'm buying a good notebook and after 2 years go constantly to the support service because there is always something that is not working and, in the end, find a motherboard dead.

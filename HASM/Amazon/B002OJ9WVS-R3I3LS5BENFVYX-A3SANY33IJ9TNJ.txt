Title: It's only a vacuum but I'm in love
Content:
I'll never buy an economy-priced vacuum cleaner again.  In fact, I expect this Miele Polaris to be the last vacuum I'll ever have to buy. Why?
- It picks up everything, including pet hair from my two ever-shedding, longhair cats, almost effortlessly.  
- The tools (don't get a model without a range of tools) reach everywhere and are helping to keep my home allergen-free (with HEPA filters). I even use dust my wood furniture with a tool (instead of moving around the dust with a cloth and some kind of spray.)
- It's small and lightweight, with an easy-to-store cord.
- It's SO quiet. Who knew a vacuum could be this small and quiet and have this much power?
No, I don't work for Miele. I don't work for an appliance store. Spending this much on a vacuum was a big decision for me; it's a luxury in my income range. But as someone who felt pressed to drag out the noisy old upright and vacuum hard wood floors almost every day this Miele Polaris is a honey. I love it.

Title: Best heater I have ever bought.
Content:
Best heater I have ever bought. Cool slim design that can rest on the floor or hung on a wall, with other unique features. Has an energy saving mode- you set the adjustable thermostat, and when it reaches that temp, it reduces the heat by 30%. Other heaters like ceramic, shut off all together which spikes the amps on your fuse box.
Also had a anti-defrost mode for the basement, when turn to the snow flake- turns it self on when it drops below 41 degrees.
I thought the manual was pretty good, so not sure if the person that wrote a bad review bought a Soleus or another brand. This is the 2nd Soleus item I have bought and been happy with both.
Great Heater.

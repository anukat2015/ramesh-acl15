Title: Apple's falling short
Content:
I bought this item expecting to be blown away.  I wasn't. I needed to update the OS to 2.2 and was actually charged $10 by Apple.  I called Apple tech support to confirm and the tech first said "no way we would do that" then confirmed that in fact Apple had gone done that path.  Then their servers are so busy that after paying the $10 I couldn't update the OS..still can't.  The only saving grace I had is that I was considering the iPhone.  I decided against it since I didn't want to live with the smalled 3G network in the US in AT&T.  Thank goodness I didn't make that mistake.

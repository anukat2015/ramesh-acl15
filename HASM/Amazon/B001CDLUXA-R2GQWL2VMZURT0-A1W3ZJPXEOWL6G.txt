Purchased this for my son for christmas, have been a Zen owner for a few years now. I have the Vision M 30 - awesome unit....
I learned from experience that the real stability of the ZEN's firmware and software products usually follows several months *after* being introduced to market.  Based on earlier reviews I've seen on this page I wasn't wrong on this one either....
Do this:   upon opening the package, *immediately* download and install the latest firmware to the unit.  Also I strongly recommend NOT using the software on the enclosed mini-cd, it's at best... a "Beta" release in my opinion.  The more recent versions on the web site are much more stable.    
We have had no problems at all once updating the firmware and software. I like the flexibility the multiple formats it handles. Screen is spectacular with the number of colors displayed.
Sound is amazing, earbuds - functional,  battery life -  typical,  ergonomics, a little awkward, (I have large hands).  Speaker is convenient but a little "tinny" in it's sound....
Overall, a very good player for the $$.  I give it a solid four stars...

Title: Stunning Performance Machine
Content:
Prior to making my purchase, I read the reviews posted by other buyers here on Amazon.com.  So, as you can imagine, I had some pretty lofty expectations from this machine.
I placed my order, and looked forward to it's arrival.  I hoped it would arrive early, so I held off sweeping my home.  My carpets were starting to get noticeably in "need of cleaning", so I went ahead and cleaned them with my old Eureka upright vacuum machine.  Wouldn't you know it - two days later, it arrived.  I thought the carpets in my 2-bedroom home looked pretty clean, but I wanted to test this baby out.  So I took it out of the box, and it was basically ready to use.
I vacuumed my home, and by the time I was finished, the "bag full" light came on.  Wow!  I was surprised that it found that much stuff, so I checked the bag.  Sure, it's much smaller than most bags, but it was indeed full.  Nice.
Additionally, my daughter used to have trouble with cat dander allergies when she came over for a visit.  That does not appear to be happening anymore.  I guess this vacuum cleaner can really suck up stuff that my other one just couldn't manage.

Its to bad that apple and microsoft hate each other because if they got along better apples Ipod players would be best in the world as it is they sre very good if you can afford an apple computer.... if you have something else then setting up your ipod account is a PAIN.....Wake up Apple you are both making zillions so just get along and you'll sell even more Ipods...

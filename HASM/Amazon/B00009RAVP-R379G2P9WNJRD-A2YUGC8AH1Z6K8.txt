Title: Excellent all around heater
Content:
With low and high settings plus oscillation, it will never be frigid inside again.  This heater is an excellent choice if you are trying to save energy and dont like the burning smell some heaters give off when they first turn on.  The Soleus Air is a very safe solution to a cold room, yet never gets too hot and wont burn anything.  The only complaint I have is that the timer makes a slightly noticeable noise, especially when automatically turning off, and sometimes it will continue to make a faint clicking sound after shutting off.  However this is a minor detail since I dont use that feature often, and only a concern for those who sleep right next the their heaters.  Anyhow, this bad boy can do the job from across the room in minutes!

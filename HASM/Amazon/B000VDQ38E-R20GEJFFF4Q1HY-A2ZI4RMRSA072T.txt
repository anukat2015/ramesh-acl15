Title: Bissell Pet Hair Eraser
Content:
After reading all the positive reviews on this vacuum cleaner I decided I would go ahead and purchase it.  I had a chair covered in cat hair (from one big fluffy kitty) and I could not get it all removed and I was even thinking of throwing the chair out.  Also I got a new kitten (9 weeks old) a week ago and she was EATING the cat hair on the furniture so I had to find something to get all the cat hair before she turned into one giant hairball.  Well no more, one swipe of the motorized brush attachment, the cat hair was GONE.  I was stunned.  I also went over my carpet with the new vacuum cleaner after I used my old vacuum cleaner, and I still got lots of cat hair, dirt, and dust.  My carpet does look a lot better too.  Fresher and newer.
The Pet Hair Eraser was fairly easy to put together, we got it together in less than 20 minutes.  The vacuum is heavier than my old one (its about 5 years old and its an upright Eureka) but if it gets in the carpet and gets all the dirt so be it.  Its not so heavy though where its hard for me to maneuver the vacuum but of course its also bigger too.  I love all the attachments that came with it too.  The kitten is not afraid of the Pet Hair Eraser, although the resident cat is.      
I highly recommend the Bissel Pet Hair Eraser.

Title: Don't Buy!
Content:
We originally had the Keurig and bought this product to replace it.  Nothing was wrong with the Keurig but we thought this would be a better product because it is able to create lattes.  What a mistake.  We have gone through two dolce gustos and they have both broken after a couple months of light use.  They both shut down half way through make coffee and  never turn back on.

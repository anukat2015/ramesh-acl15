Title: A Great Camera...even for a beginner.
Content:
I love this camera!  I am a complete novice to anything beyond a disposable camera, but this camera makes me feel like a pro.  Can be a little intimidating at times, but I guess that's what the instruction manual is for.  The range of possibilities for each shot is my favorite thing about the camera. I love experimenting with the flash, the color and the shutter speed to see how different a shot can come out.  The LCD is a great tool for live view, but I mostly use the viewfinder. More than I've ever spent on anything, but worth every penny!!

Title: Good computer, some weird quirks
Content:
Amazon provided this computer in their usual quick fashion.  It has some excellent features and some slightly irritating ones.  I have been using it about a month now on a daily basis.
  First, the good news.  It does have excellent battery life.  With the wireless on and letting its very good power management profile do its thing, it will last about 3.5 hours.  Next, it has a full numeric keypad in addition to the normal keyboard--very nice.  Next, nice bright screen and good sized keys.  I also like the front light that is orange while on AC and charging and blue when fully charged.  The lit power button is also nice.  Another nice feature is a top mount DVD eject button.  The unit is very light and thin.  Also, it does run nice and cool and the fan is very quiet.  I haven't tried the built-in webcam and microphone, so I can't comment on the quality.
  Now, the somewhat bad new.  No spacer betwen the keyboard and numeric keypad, which results in some accidental wrong keystrokes.  Also, the keys have a very sloppy feel to them.  Other quirks are: no caps lock indicator or num lock indicator that I have been able to find.  Also, the WLAN off/on switch is the indicator, which is very unintuitive.  The touchpad is centered on the keyboard, making it about 3 in left of center on the computer due to the numeric keypad--sort of strange.  But there is a touchpad deactivation switch which can be handy at times.  The headphone jack is in a good location, but is black, which makes it a search.  The card slot is also in a strange location at the very center up front below the charge light.
  Overall, a good computer and a good deal at Amazon's price.

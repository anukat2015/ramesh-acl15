Title: Hold onto your area rugs!!
Content:
This is a fantastic little cleaning dynamo!  I have never seen suction like on this vacuum cleaner.  Easy to change from carpet to floor mode and tools are handy and easy to snap on.  It's also nice to empty out your dirt after each use..the thought of it hanging around in a bag for months at a time like on bagged vacuums grosses me out now that I know what is lurking in the carpets.
I would definately reccomend this - great product at a great price...I am so happy I didn't spend the money on the Miele I was considering.

Title: Great for vintage floors!
Content:
I love this vacuum! 
I have a large apartment with old wooden floors that get a lot of dust and pet hair stuck between the boards. It has enough suction to thoroughly clean them as well as my two low pile area rugs.
And it's SO QUIET, which is great when, like us, you live in a multi-unit building.
Probably not the best vacuum for a fully carpeted apartment because of it's lack of a rolling-bristle-brush; but I couldn't be happier!

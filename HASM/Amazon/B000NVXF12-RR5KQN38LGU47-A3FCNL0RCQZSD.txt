Title: Great camera for the price
Content:
I've only had this camera about a month, but so far, I am really happy with it.  It's small, lightweight, and easy to use.  It takes great pictures in both bright and low light. 
The only reason I give this 4 starts out of 5 is that the operation can be a little slow, especially when making long exposures - there seems to be quite a delay in the time between when the shutter closes to when it displays your image, but other than that, this camera is perfect. 
I am a fan of film myself, and for any serious work I will probably always use film.  I bought this camera for a photography class, and it's great for taking photos that turn out beautifully and are quickly and easily transferred to a class computer to turn in.

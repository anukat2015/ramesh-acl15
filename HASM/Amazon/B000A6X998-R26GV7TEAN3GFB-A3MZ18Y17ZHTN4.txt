Title: Great working heater, even better warranty!
Content:
My mother-in-law purchased this heater still like brand new in the box from a yard sale. My husband & I used for an entire winter season when our heat went out. Heats wonderfully and the fan blower allows us to place the heater about 10 feet from the couch and you can still feel the warmth. Well, the heater went kaputz & I inquired with the manufacturer & advised I had no receipt or proof of purchase. Would you believe they sent me a brand new one no further questions asked?! I was very impressed and pleased. Once we received our new heater, it was actually better than the heater we started with because this one came with the electronic thermastat whereas the old one just had the dial. They didn't even ask for the old one back!  WOW.  There is something to be said for great customer service these days. I noticed with the paperwork that came with the new heater this thing has a 6 year warranty and the old heater we had was stamped on the back 2005 so they really honor this!  AND the heater is great!  A must have overall for the price.

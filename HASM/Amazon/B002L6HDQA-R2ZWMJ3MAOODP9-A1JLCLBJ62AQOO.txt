Title: Never got a chance to have it.
Content:
i bought it, and it was sent promptly. The only problem was that the post office delivered it to someone else's house. They were never able to find it and I gave someone a free christmas present. But I called Amazon, and they were extremely helpful and gave me a full refund.
I would definitely suggest Amazon giving buyers the option of adding insurance to the package, just to be on the safe side.

Title: My Favorite Camera
Content:
I bought the Nikon D40x when my arm was twisted to lend my D70s to my daughter who is in art school and was taking some photography classes. I use it almost daily to take picture of my cats (I breed Siberian cats) and of my merchandise for my online store. The D40x is smaller and lighter and I found I really prefer this camera - its fits my hand better and is easier to take with me. The quality of pictures seems very similar and the features that are less than the D70s are not ones that bothered me - it is more limited in flash and some compatibility with accessories but I was so not bothered I have forgotten what they were. It is the camera I grab when I have a choice.... the D70s is back home but not used quite as much....

Title: Not so "Ultra Quiet"!
Content:
We purchased 2 of these because it seemed like a great deal and we figured Haier would make a good product. I wish we had only purchased one first to try. We installed one so far, in a very small bedroom. It is very loud. We had an Emerson Quiet Cool in all bedrooms before this and they are MUCH quieter. The other issue is that you have to use the remote to change settings. There's no way to do it manually, so if the battery dies on your remote, you can only turn it on or off. I gave it two stars because it does keep the small space relatively cool. I also chose this model because of the energy rating, but after reading the other reviews, I'm worried about that too---we'll see. Would not recommend this product with all the other options out there. Probably returning the second one.

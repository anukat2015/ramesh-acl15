Title: UGH!
Content:
I bought this computer in August for college..initially, I loved it.  The appearance is perfect; however, the quality is poor.  Approximately two months after purchasing, my screen would randomly turn black and my computer wouldn't turn back on.  After speaking with customer service several times, we finally fixed this problem.  Recently, I took my laptop back to the Geek Squad at Best Buy to tell them about the terribly loud noises that it makes.  They kept my laptop for a week, then said that they heard the "jet engine sound" it was making, but that it was normal.  I'm sorry, but if my roommate can hear my computer roaring from across the room then it shouldn't be normal.  The noises are incredibly annoying and I find it hard to concentrate on what I'm doing...also, I have to restart often.  I definitely would not recommend this computer.  I have had it for 7 months, and have had problems for the past 5.

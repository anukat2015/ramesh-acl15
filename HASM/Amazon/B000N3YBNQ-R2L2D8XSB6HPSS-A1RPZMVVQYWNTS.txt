Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
I have very short nap carpeting, hardwood floors, and 2 cats! I have a good canister vacuum for regular cleaning, but needed something small for in between quick cleanups. Anyone with animals and short nap carpeting knows you have to have a good vacuum to suck up animal fur. I have tried other small uprights and they never did that great of a job. Electrolux has a good reputation and thought I would give it a try. It is GREAT! It has 2 setting, one for carpeting and one for floors. The suction is just as good as a full size vacuum. And as others have said, the bag is kinda small and fills quickly. One of my bedrooms have heavier pile carpeting, it did a good job there also, but was kinda hard to push. Others have commented on wanting larger bags or attachments, maybe, but it would end up a larger vacuum! This vacuum wasn't intended to be the only vacuum you own! All I no is that I have tried other small vacuums for quick cleanups, and none have compared to this! So far I have not found anything negative about this product!

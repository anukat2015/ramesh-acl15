Title: Good
Content:
I was very impressed with how this vacuum cleaned my wood floors and rug.  However the swivel head can make it difficult to clean where you want it to.  Also when we removed the power head to use the other attachments there is a piece that breaks easily.  When we brought it to the repair shop to be fixed they had 4 other Electrolux's there with the same problem.  Poor design on the manufacturers part.  However as I said before, I was impressed on how it cleaned.

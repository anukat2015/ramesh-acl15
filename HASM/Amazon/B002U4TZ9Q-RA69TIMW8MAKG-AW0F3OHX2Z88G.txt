Title: Incredible computer for the price!
Content:
I bought this computer three weeks ago from Best Buy for 349.  I can't believe the value for the price.  I love windows 7 -- it is much quicker than vista and they have added some very nice features.  All the MS Office programs load quick as well as any other program I have used.  It comes preloaded with Norton Internet Security.  I really hate it when they load programs to get you hooked for 30 days free and then remind you every hour that it is time to buy, however, Norton is a very good fit for this computer and it doesn't seem to eat up any processing speed running in the background. I'm going to wait another week then part with some hard earned money for the annual subscription.  The only negative with this computer is that the cooling fan cycles on and off which can be annoying if you are working in a quiet area. It does it job, though and keeps the computer cool. Bottom line: Unless you are a power hungry gamer, you can't go wrong with this computer.

Title: My first Amazon return
Content:
A few times it worked great, but mostly it brewed uneven. I'm not being a nitpicker here... Literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim. There was no pattern to it, sometimes it was  the left one, sometimes the right one, sometimes neither. Filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging... don't mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter! It only took two days before I realized this was not worth the money or the time.

Title: Toshiba Satellite 14 inch laptop
Content:
This laptop is very good for it's price, i looked every where to find a better laptop but couldn't. There are only two things i don't like about this laptop-
1) There is no HDMI output, i don't understand why any laptop doesn't have that feature. 
2) The speakers are pretty bad for a laptop, looks like Toshiba found something to cut costs with. The best idea would be to buy some external speakers. 
Everything else is great, the processor and memory is great. I particularly like the size and it's look. The key board is set up great, there no useless keys on this laptop.

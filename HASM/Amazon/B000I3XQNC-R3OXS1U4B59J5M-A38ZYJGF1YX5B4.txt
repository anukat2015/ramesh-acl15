Title: Had to say 5 stars because my images are sharp and professional looking
Content:
I took pictures with this camera with artificial light, natural light, and when it was almost dark and all of my images came out sharp.  I'm only using the cheap 18-55mm lens, which does not have image stabilization.  As long as I use a tripod, or brace against something to hold the camera still, the images are perfect.  I shot landscapes, portraits, animals, moving traffic, the sky, the moon, and everything I could think of and it all came out right.  
I was going to buy a 5D, but so far I'm satisfied with this camera and the price is way lower.  Now I wonder what my pictures would be like with an IS lens... hmmmm :)

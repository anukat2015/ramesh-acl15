Title: powerhouse
Content:
oooh man, this is a keeper, snagged it on tigerdirect before it went out of stock. Nice screen, lovely burgundy color. Stylish little metal strip down the top there. easy to use, handles complex programs at ease on a budget. I think tigerdirect still has a few left. My only complaint is; WHY VISTA?! why?! why gateway, why did you let me down? sure, 64-bit is an upside, but vista just sucks. XP all the way. btw, you can update to windows XP, but it takes a while to find the right drivers for this to run XP smoothly.

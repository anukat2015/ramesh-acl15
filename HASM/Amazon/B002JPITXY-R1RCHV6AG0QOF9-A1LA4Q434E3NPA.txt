Title: The Zune HD leaps way past the iPod
Content:
Hello, my spouse and I have both devices and have experience with other touch devices -and without a doubt the Zune HD is faster and more feature packed than any other similar item.  The Zune software works awesome on my PC and is a lot more fun to use than iTunes.  The Zune's graphics make Apple's iTunes and iPod designs seem very dated and old.  We have been using both and so far are migrating exclusively to the Zune HD.  The Zune's internet feature works awesome. I have the full internet though a WiFi connection. -You can't do that on an iPod and it works much better than either the iPhone or Palm Pre.  The graphics from the Zune HD are incredible and the device feels extremely solid. All the touch commands and menu navigation flows quickly and smoothly giving the feel of a high quality fast processor.

The FM and HD radio work awesome.  It picks up clearer reception than the Kenwood HD radio that we have in one of our vehicles.
The App store for the Zune HD is very limited, but the potential for some great games exists. 
Overall my wife and I are blown away at the quality of the Zune HD.  I could easily convert every Ipod fan to a Zune HD fan if they had just 30 minutes with the Zune HD it is that neat and fun to play with.
..I am not a fanboy, just a convert from an iPod to a Zune HD.

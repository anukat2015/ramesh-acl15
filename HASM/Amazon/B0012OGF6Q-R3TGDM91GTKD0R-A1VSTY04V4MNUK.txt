Title: Great Value
Content:
I purchased my Nikon D60 and was pleasantly surprised that the camera was in new condition as it was a factory Refurbished. I have had nothing but fun with this camera and would strongly recommend for those who may be a bit skeptical about purchasing a used or refurbished item that it's a great value and you save a considerable amount of cash in the process.

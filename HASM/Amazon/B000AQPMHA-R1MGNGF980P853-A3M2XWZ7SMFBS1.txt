Title: Amazing and Extremely Affordable
Content:
After spending much time looking at online reviews (including Amazon) comparing the Keurig models to other "single cup" machines, I made the decision to purchase this model.
Yes, it has two cup sizes. Yes, it has auto shut off (after 2 hours). 
An amazing machine that I'm extremely happy I purchased. It takes up little counter space. Brews a quick cup of coffee (or tea or hot chocolate). And, depending on what type of pods you use, brews quite the good cup of coffee. 
I found that the button for the "larger" size adequately fills a normal-sized mug. For my travel mug, I have to use two pods or brew twice through the first pod (which is not a huge deal if you use extra bold coffee). 
Bonus? I registered my product on Keurig's website and received a great deal on K-cups. Yes, they're not the most environmentally friendly products, but that's also not a legitimate reason -- in my opinion -- to give the machine a poor review. The machine works as advertised and, honestly, if you're into being "green", why are you even pondering purchasing this type of item in the first place? 
You can purchase a reusable K-cup (the "My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter") that allows you to brew the coffee of your choice -- an added bonus for this line of machines. Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter

Title: Simple & Sweet
Content:
This vacuum cleaner is small and mighty, sweet and simple to use.  This is money well spent.  No bags to buy which is a savings right there! An easy to dump and clean dirt bin. I love everything about this vacuum cleaner from the retractible cord to changing the power head to the bare floor head. Can adjust suction right on the handle. I am always one to purchase the extra filters for the hepa and the dirt bin as its convenient to have them on hand.  I have only cleaned the dirt bin filter. I looked at this vacuum on consumer reports looked it up on line reviews and also where to buy it.  Amazon was the most inexpensive and I could have it delivered free!

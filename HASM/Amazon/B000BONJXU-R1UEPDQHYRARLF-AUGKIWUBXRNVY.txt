Title: Great Bargain
Content:
This is a nice little MP3 that doesn't cost much. We were buying one each for a niece and nephew, so we didn't want to get into too much money. I had an RCA, but wasn't happy with that so I decided to go with a different brand. 
The transfer for this player is easy and it works well with both Musicmatch jukebox and Windows Media. The Sound quality is good, the headphones aren't spectacular, but how many MP3 players come with great headphones. The menu system is good and makes it easy to select what you want, but I also like the fact that it is not necessary. The player will start playing as soon as you turn it on. 
I don't know if I will still love it down the road, but right now it is great. And more importantly it is a great bargain.

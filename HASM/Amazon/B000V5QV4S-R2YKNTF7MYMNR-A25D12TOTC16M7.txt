Title: The real thing
Content:
I have been planning to buy a high quality digital SLR camera for a while and when I finally decided on the new EOS 40D by Canon I thought i would just go out and pick the best price and buy.Little did I know. I found the price range from $400.oo to $ 1200.oo for body only.As I dug in I encountered a stange internet "phenomenon" called misleading advertising.Some of these "cheaper" cameras were sold as authentic Canons yet on inquiry I was informed that I was looking at a plastic bodied camera instead of the magnesium one as always showcased as Canon's design. Also I was informed to upgrade for more money to a "retail" box which contained all the extras since these "cheaper" ones came with nothing but the body...no software..no battery..no neck strap. Some, on the other hand came with everything including the kitchen sink FOR THE SAME AMAZING LOW PRICE. I realized something was fishy when I was literally hung up on by vendors, when I questioned these deals.These were often vendors of "reputation",advertised in good photography magazines. I was discouraged to the point of thinking that the only way I could buy a camera safely was at a physical retail store which wasn't convenient at all for my location in upper Michigan. Even e-bay was scary. Then I thought I would try Amazon and I knew the best price was a reasonable price at this store...I found it ..clicked it and bought it on the spot.It arrived in 4 days and it was and is the real thing...an amazing camera that I am just beginning to realize the potential of,to capture stunning photos.

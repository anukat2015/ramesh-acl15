Title: Super Camera
Content:
This past weekend was my first opportunity to use my new Nikon D300. I have had other digital cameras but never a DSLR -- only the "point and shoot" variety of cameras. So far I love this Nikon D300; it is a super camera! I took it to a family gathering and took some shots both indoors and out. I was shooting in "P" mode and occasionally beginning to "tweak" some settings. What I am excited about is that I can take good pictures right out of the box with this camera. Also I know as I learn more about photography that I can "grow" with this camera. The shots from this weekend had good color and were very clear. I am very happy with this purchase! Also I would recommend buying the Introduction to the Nikon D300. This DVD is sold by Amazon.com and is a very helpful tool in learning how to use the D300.

Title: Will it cure your iPhone fever?
Content:
The iPod Touch is a really good buy, but if you have a bad case of iPhone envy, you're not going to find the cure here.
Cons..
+ No internet outside of Wifi (can't connect to your cellphone's internet unless you have a Windows Mobile smartphone and even that takes some tinkering)
+ Bluetooth only works to connect to iPhones or another iPod Touch
+ External speaker is extremely weak and barely audible
+ Microphone is in the earphones, not on the actual iPod Touch
Pros..
+ Amazing display. Go find a friend with either an iPod Touch or an iPhone and you'll see
+ Access to the App store's 75,000+ apps (even though a great majority of the apps cost money)
+ Built in Nike+
+ The same operating system that made the iPhone the invention of the decade
If you want an iPhone, save yourself the time and go buy and iPhone instead.  If you're happy with and iPod that doesn't have a camera, phone, or 3G internet access, but can do a lot of cool stuff, buy this.

Title: Awesome Camera
Content:
I decided to get into photography around May of '08.  I surfed the net for hours on end(It's something I do) and went through dozens of reviews and comparisons for dSLRs.  I came to the conclusion that the XTI was the best camera and offered the most bang for the buck.  
I bought this with the 18-55mm kit, and also purchased the 50mm f/1.8 prime lens.  Amazing.
Picture quality is AWESOME!  There is so much versatility with this camera compared to a point and shoot.  Obviously the XTI isn't something I want to lug around to a party or the pool hall to take photos of friends, but it's perfect for portraits and landscapes(all I've done so far).
I've gotten some really really good photos out of this camera.  The Photos are fairly sharp if you hold it(almost perfect with tripod and self timer) and I can only brag about owning one.  Great job Canon.  Thanks!

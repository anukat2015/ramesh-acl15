Title: Small, fast and long-lasting. . .laptop!
Content:
Love this laptop. Used it on coast to coast flights - never came close to draining the battery. It's super light and cute and runs like a dream. Funnily enough, its keyboard is bigger than my old laptop's - which was bigger overall. The price couldn't be beat. I did tons of research - was considering getting a netbook, but realized I needed more power and memory. This laptop is netbook-size and not much more expensive. (I paid $550.) Its speakers are pretty powerful, if tinny and video plays great. (even streaming video). Downloads are quick, even over wireless. The only problem I've run into is the multi-gesture touchpad. You're supposed to be able to zoom in and out and other commands, but I've never been able to get it to work right. But I don't really care! Definitely recommend this as a powerful budget laptop.

Title: Nikon D200 + 18-200mm VR + SB600 Flash Drop Tested!
Content:
We have been overwhelmed with how excellent this camera is. I have owned D70 when it first came out and got the D200 when it was released early this year but, due to it's oversold situation I got mine sometime August 2006. It's outstanding with the VR 18-200mm lens...it's really great!
I had a party in the house a few days ago, I had the camera sit on the tripod with an SB600 Flash mounted and my helper tripped the tripod and my camera hit right smack on the hard concrete floor. The lens hood hit the floor and it broke, my SB600 flash battery cover opened and all AA batteries came loose.......ohhhh "My goodnes" I screamed (I thought I would have a heart attack) to see my precious toy going down the drain. I picked it up and saw that other than a broken lens hood (which can easily be replaced), the flash, VR lens and the body were pretty much unscathed. 
I tested and tried shooting and boom to my surprise it was just as perfect as it was.....Ohhhh I love NIKON! It's built to last! You really get what you pay for and I will forever treasure that one drop test experience! I will surely be a nikon fan for LIFE!

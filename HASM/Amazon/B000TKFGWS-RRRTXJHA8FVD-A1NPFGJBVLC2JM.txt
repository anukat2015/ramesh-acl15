Title: Loud little heater!
Content:
I bought this even though there was a similar one for less money (because the reviews said that it was loud).  This was purchased to go into a kids room at night.  I was disappointed to find that it didn't have an auto-off in case it tipped over.  It is also so loud that my kids wouldn't have been able to sleep with it when set to the thermostat.  If I had left it on consistently it would have acted as a white noise, however this would make the room too hot.  Set on thermostat control, the constant on/off self regulation would wake the kids up-- it is TOO LOUD!

Title: Farberware percolator not like they used to be
Content:
My original Faberware percolator dating from the 1980's provided many years of service.  When the heating element finally gave out, I purchased what I thought was the same product in 2009.  The first percolator I received had a cracked steel basket which was promptly exchanged by Amazon.com.  The replacement pot lasted all of 8 months before the plastic housing which holds the prongs for the plug cracked and the prong became buried inside the housing.  It can not be used.  These new percolators are made in China and they are junk. I am so disappointed that this is not the Farberware product of years ago.  Save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF TRASH!!  I'm trying to find a coffeepot made anywhere but China.

Title: Won't last much beyond the warranty
Content:
When our landlord started charging for gas but not for electricity, we bought three oil-filled DeLonghi heaters (TRN1015T). They were delightful for the first two weeks, then became increasingly noisy (one developed an annoying humming, vibrating sound, another an annoying clicking in the timer, and the third one had both sound effects). They all limped along past the 12 month warranty, but another 6 months of intermittent use later, two of them are dead. I'll stay away from DeLonghi from now on.

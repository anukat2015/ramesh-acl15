Title: Really Wish I Was Drinking Espresso Right Now
Content:
I just purchased this product from Target and was very excited to begin making my own delicious espresso. I opened up the box, read all the instructions, and set up the machine on my counter. Just as I was about to begin brewing espresso, I was unpleasantly surprised to discover that the machine had spilled all of its water all over the counter. I read the other reviews that described other minor leaking problems, but I was not expecting this. Completely unusable, right out of the box. I was looking forward to using this product, but I will be returning it as soon as possible.

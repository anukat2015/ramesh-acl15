Title: Overall is great ! Battery not so good
Content:
Excellent product. I installed several softwares (IBM Websphere BPM suite) supposed not to be light and it runs pretty 
fast without a big effort. It has a nice chess drawing in the lid, easy to clean. The screen is good. I wish it could be a 
little brighter, but it is ok.
The start up time is really short.
It is so light, that I don't even think about removing the DVD player and using the plastic mock adapter (included)
The graphics are good, nothing to complain about it.
If you want a light and powerfull laptop for business or entertainment it seems to be perfect.
In the BIOS setup program you can disable the fan to be ON all time. It can be ON only when required.
The only cons I see is about the battery life and the touchpad that is not too sensitive (minor thing).
I recommend this product

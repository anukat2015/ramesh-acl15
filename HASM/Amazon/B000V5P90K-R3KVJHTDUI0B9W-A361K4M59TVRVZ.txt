Title: Wonderful Camera!
Content:
This camera has a very professional feel and good ergonomics.
As far as physical build quality, it's very nice; much better than the lower end SLRs that Canon produces. The shooting speed is wonderful when trying to capture fast action. The autofocus works very quickly and accurately.
While not cons, I should point out two details: 1) The camera's live preview is only designed to operate in the advanced modes (not in the point & shoot modes) 2) The camera's heavy duty build comes at the cost of a little more weight. If you are simply looking for a camera to casually carry around, this isn't it... but then again, you probably wouldn't be looking at an SLR. :)
I would highly recommend this camera to anybody wanting durability and quality without the $2000+ price tag!

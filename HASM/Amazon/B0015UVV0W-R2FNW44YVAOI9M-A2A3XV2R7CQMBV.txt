Title: Jasmine the kitten makes this worthless to me
Content:
I like Vornado heaters a lot.  They give out moderately cool air, so you sit around and think "it's not working, it's not working" until you suddenly realize the room is warm.  And unlike the imitations, the heat is not as stratified--particularly if you have it set so the fan is always on.
I thought this one might be sturdier than the smaller ones (it might well be) and that the remote would be wonderful.
But...
The top is a perfect place for a kitten to rest, especially when it's heating.  And if she wriggles a bit, she presses buttons, any buttons--but particularly mode and temperature.  So the remote becomes useless.  If I don't know what mode it was in, I can't change it to high heat with the remote (and I certainly haven't gotten used to which way is "up" temperature on the remote). 
While I've been writing this she's managed to turn it off completely once, and another time beep the thermostat down below what the fan thinks is the room air temperature (it's at least 3 degrees too high in my space).  
I could take it down to a small work-room in the barn, but there's a problem there, too.  One that I suspect that Vornado did deliberately, so this would be perfect for supplementary heating in a coolish room.  The lowest setting on the thermostat is 65.  Way too high to use as an anti-freeze setting when the room is unoccupied. 
Jasmine is a really cute and sweet kitten.

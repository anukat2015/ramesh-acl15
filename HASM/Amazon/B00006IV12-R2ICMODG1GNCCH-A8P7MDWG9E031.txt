Title: Excellent for the price
Content:
This heater was something of an impulse buy (I got it at Target for $20), and boy, am I glad I had that impulse! I've used space heaters in the past, all of which were the "dish style" with no fan. This one really puts them to shame! If left on the "constant heat" setting, any enclosed space will become tropical in temperature. 
I have a somewhat large bedroom in an upstairs apartment I use this in. As other reviews have stated, the fan is quiet. When I'm on a speaker call and the heater's fan kicks in, no one on the other line mentions hearing it. Though having more precise control over the temperature would be nice, you can't really expect too much from such an inexpensive heater. The fact that it was only $20 and still comes with at least some form of temperature control is surprising! I'd definitely recommend this to anyone on a budget that has a cold room; certainly good for the price.

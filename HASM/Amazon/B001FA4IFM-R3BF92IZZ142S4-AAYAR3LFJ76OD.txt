Title: Very good heater
Content:
I have never owned an electric space heater but this unit works great. We run it in our living room and in the bedroom and it keeps both rooms at a comfortable temperature. Our living room is 28X27 and our master bedroom is 18X20. It works ver quietly also. It is not silent but i find it is quieter on high actually because on low the unit's fan seems to be louder to me. I do not use the thermostat feature as we just leave it on high in both rooms for the 6 or 8 hours we are in each room. I am thinking of buying another for the deer camp trailer as well it works so good. It is sturdy and stands well on carpet, not tippy or anything. It also has a handle built into the back so its easy to move and the grill turns orange when the front is hot so you know to be careful. Overall great unit I would suggest to anyone to buy.

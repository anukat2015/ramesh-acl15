Title: Overflows and makes a mess!!
Content:
I am not at all happy with this coffee pot.     When the pot is inserted into the coffee maker it doesn't sufficiently depress the "anti drip" mechanism under the basket resulting in slow water flow.   Periodically this causes the water (and the grinds) to overflow the filter.  When this happens the grinds get down into the anti drip mechanism and block the flow completely.  That causes the and water and coffee pour out all over the kitchen counter.   Not what I want to see when I stumble down stairs expecting my coffee to be ready.
Also agree with the other reviewers on the temperature.   Pre-heating the carafe does not work if you use the auto-timer and have the pot turn itself on so that you will have coffee ready when you wake up.

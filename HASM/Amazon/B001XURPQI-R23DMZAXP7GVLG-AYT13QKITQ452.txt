Title: Canon T1i
Content:
I just bought the canon T1i, and it is my first digital SLR.  It is an easy to use camera and the pictures are very good.  I am wondering what the impact on quality would be of buying a higher end lense for the camera.  The video is good but you have to focus before starting the video and if shooting distance changes it impacts the quality.  It is handly to have video and SLR in one camera.  Overall I like the camera so far and would recommend it.

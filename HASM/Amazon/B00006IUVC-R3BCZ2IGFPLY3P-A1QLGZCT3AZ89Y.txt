Title: Bitter coffee
Content:
When our old percolator died, we bought this for one reason--to make coffee.  We liked the programmable timer.  However, after two weeks of fiddling with the strength adjustment, changing coffee brands, changing the mix, etc., we are resigned to the fact that this thing just makes lousy, bitter-tasting coffee.  Never mind that it is impossible to pour from the top half of the carafe without spilling and that the timer erratically changes it's setting.  I could live with that if it weren't for the bad coffee.  Buy something else.  I'm shopping now.

Title: Great for small rooms
Content:
If you are looking for a cost-effective way to heat small rooms, the Lasko 758000 Cyclonic Ceramic Heater is a great buy. In order to be succinct, please find the "pros" and "cons" below.
Pros:
* Effective and easy-to-understand controls that allow for automatic settings governed by temperature objectives or heating by high or low output
* An illuminated display (easily viewable from 5-10 yards) that indicates the surrounding room temperature
* Directional control for heat output
* Nice form factor that allows for flexible floor placement in terms of space needed and general aesthetics
Cons:
* At higher temperature settings, the unit generates a little noise. To be fair, however, the sound is similar to and no more imposing that a PC or Printer
All in all, this is a good unit for rooms that central heating does not reach effectively. I would definitely buy another unit should the occasion arise.

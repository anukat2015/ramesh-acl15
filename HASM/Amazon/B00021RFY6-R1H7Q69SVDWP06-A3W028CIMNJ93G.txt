Title: junk
Content:
i've used this for approx a year, daily cleaning, the sound of a jet taking off in the morning.  It did make ok coffee.  It developed a nasty habit of the filter door popping open turning the grind process, making a really big mess.  i've cleaned, cleaned cleaned, this morning it happened again.  After another hour of cleaning.  i broke it into many pieces.  Looking at the inside, i now see what a piece of junk it is, with a stainless steel veneer.  Don't purchase.  There must be better out there.

Title: Water coil failure
Content:
I have owned this machine for over three years, therefore it is out of warranty. We rarely use the grinder, but the machine has always made excellent coffee. Recently, the water began leaking out the bottom, which I guess is a weak spot, based upon other reviews and pictures posted. I repaired mine by using heavy tin foil and JB weld, and it has been working fine for a few months.
Simply remove the bottom from the machine to expose the water coil, then remove the bracket holding the coil to the base. Use emory cloth to clean the surface and scuff the area around the hole, then cut a piece of heavy duty foil slightly larger than the hole, and mix up a batch of JB weld. Position the foil over the hole, then cover with the JB weld, coating it entirely, and extending an additional 1/2 inch or so around the edges. Let sit 24 hours to set up good before using. The foil just keeps the circulating water from actually coming into contact with the JB weld.
Cheap, easy fix for an otherwise great machine. Works for me !!

Title: Best color accuracy ever
Content:
Pros: All the advantages of a D-SLR (fast ISO speed, super-low noise, wide range of aperture and shutter speeds, versatility, huge buffer, compatibility with high-speed cards, etc.); unmatchable color accuracy and brilliance; beautiful style, battery life (After I took 500 regular photos and 20 flash photos, the battery still showed full.  Nikon¡¦s claim that the battery can last 2,000 photos may not be too far from truth); reasonable price.Cons:  The camera has a few minor annoyances, but the most horrible thing about this camera which may apply to all other D-SLRs is the dust problem.  Knowing that D-SLR is very vulnerable to dust, I never took off the lens (included in the kit) after I first mounted it on the camera.  Yet, the dust still somehow managed to get into the low-pass of the CCD anyway, though I have strictly followed the professional standards in avoiding dust from getting into the camera.  After less than two months of use, I found a few consistent light dots on bright areas of the photos such as the blue sky.  However, I was delighted to find cleaning the CCD is not as difficult as I first thought.  Just strictly follow what the manual says and it took me less than 2 minutes to get the dust off the CCD, though I couldn¡¦t see with my eye any dust on the CCD itself.  I hope Nikon can make better seals around the lens¡¦ mount in its next version of affordable D-SLR or enable the camera to clean its CCD like Canon 10D or Olympus E-1.

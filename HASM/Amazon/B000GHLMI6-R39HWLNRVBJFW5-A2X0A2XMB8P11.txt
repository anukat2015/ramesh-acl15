Title: Good Hot Coffee
Content:
No more broken carafes.  Coffee is hot enough for our use for the 2 hour "on" period. No leaks.  I tried to tighten all screws before our use, based on previous comments of reviewer.  All screws were tight from the factory.  Delivery was about 4 days after doing the on-line order. Yes, I would buy this item again.

Title: 4 day Cold Weather Test - Night Low 15 to Day High 36
Content:
4 day test: Last 96 hours low 15 to high 35. Location: Reno, NV. Elevation:4598 Occupants: 2 adults. Home: 3yr. old 2x4 wood construction (R15 walls / R 36 attic) 2000 sf single level. Double Vinyl windows. Usually heated with Forced air natural gas. 
Testing partial living area: 1200 sf / Open floor plan / 9 foot ceilings /  includes great room (livingroom), kitchen, diningroom, & sunken sunroom.  1 Safe Heat DeLonghi TRD0715T SafeHeat Oil-Filled Radiating Heater placed in sunken sunroom. Heater has run 24/7 for 4 complete days. Forced Gas Heat system is turned off. Results: All days are basically the same. 7 AM - temp in the test area is 60-63 degrees while outside temp is 16-20 degrees. It At 11 am and the test area average 68 while outside temp average is 25 degrees. I'm amazed this one heater is doing close to what our complete forced gas system does. Keep in mind that the other 800 sf (bedrooms and halls) are closed off and not being heated. I'm quite sure our power bill goes down. Not sure how many amps this heater uses. Guestimate: 25 cents an hour running at high setting. ( 1500 watts ) and about half cost at low setting ( 800 watts ). Cost per KWH is 14 cents in Reno.

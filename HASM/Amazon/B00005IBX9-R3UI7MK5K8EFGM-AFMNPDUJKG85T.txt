Title: 2nd Brewer
Content:
We had our first Cuisanart coffee maker for several years.  When it finally became apparent (kept turning itself off) that it had to be replaced, my husband said he wanted one just like it; so I went to Amazon and found it. We are very pleased.  Coffee in the morning is one of my five most important things in life.

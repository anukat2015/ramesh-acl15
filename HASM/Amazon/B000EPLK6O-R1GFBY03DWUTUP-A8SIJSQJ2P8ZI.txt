Title: great product and great service
Content:
I looked for a small coffee maker for a long time.  It was a bonus to find a five cup instead of a four cup.  It makes great coffee and worth the price that I paid. The only downfall, a small one, is that it drips when you pour if not careful and you need to remember to secure the lid when you pour or it may fall off.  Very small problem, however.

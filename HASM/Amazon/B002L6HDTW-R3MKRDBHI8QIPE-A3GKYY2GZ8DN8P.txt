Title: Not a huge leap
Content:
I have both nano 4th & 5th generation. But there are some short comings of 5G I wasn't expecting. Fist of all the wide screen is can't be used in both horizontal and vertical veiw for all screens. Also the one that I bought has an insensitive sensor for shifting between views. The radio is ok, but can't use it on the dock, since it needs an antenna (earphones in this case) for reception. The camera will only take videos, but no pictures.
Yes it needs some more improvements as Apple is never ready to give full accessories at once. Still its a nice gadget. Slim, fashionable & usefull.
P.S. My 4G ipod nano has started going to shuffle mode on it's own, satndýng stýll on the dock. This should normally happen when you shake it hard. Maybe Apple has a problem with these sensors.

Title: truly THIN and LIGHT
Content:
Pros
- Thin and light, hence the portability 
- It doesn't heat up like other laptops
- So far, it's feels like a fast computer to me
- I personally like the keyboard
- At least 8 hours battery life with normal usage
Cons
- No optical drive (but you should be aware of this before purchasing) 
- the touch pad does annoy me because it doesn't have borders and I do end up clicking on things with my wrist without knowing (I plan on using a mouse and locking the touch pad, so it's not a big deal)
- The package is missing a mouse and carry bag (Amazon did a great job compensating for this! 20% off!)

Title: Love and Hate - 4 years with my grind and brew
Content:
After 4 years our Grind and Brew died! I miss it. I had a love hate relationship with it. Yes, it did flood the counters sometimes like other owners have mentioned. I found that that would only happen if I got preground beans from a coffee store and they didn't have their grinder calibrated right. I know this machine already had the grinder. I was trying to figure out why our machine was flooding so I tried having the beans ground before brewing another way. 
I can't forget that sometimes the drawer would pop out in mid brew and pour hot coffee all over the counter. I would wake up and come down to our kitchen with a pool of hot coffee on our wood floors. My day was doomed after cleaning up that mess. This happend more often when we didn't clean out with a brush the latch to the drawer. 
I loved this coffee maker because it made the best coffee I have ever tasted and I love coffee. 4 cups a day for 14 years almost. 
What killed our grind and brew? The pump overheated and broke last week. 4 years exactly after we bought it. Grinder still works great!
Fondest memory: The sound of the grinder. It woke our dog up every morning. He knew it was "time for a walk". 
We used just the grinder this weekend and our dog just walked to the front door after we ground some beans. Where's my walk?
Don't know what we will buy to replace it. For now we French Press.

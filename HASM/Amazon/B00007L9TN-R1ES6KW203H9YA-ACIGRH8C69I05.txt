Title: It sounds like an atom bomb is going off
Content:
If heat is what you're looking for then this might be your product, but if you don't want to kill yourself then I'd go with something else.  This is seriously the loudest thing I have ever heard in my entire life.  At first you'll think the thing is just warming up, and after about 10 more minutes of it you'll think its broken.  Finally, you'll realize that its just loud.  It sounds like you've got front row seats at a NASCAR race or you're actually on the space ship thats launching into space, but no, its just this new heater that you bought.  Don't buy this thing unless its for your deaf brother, but it might even be too loud for him.

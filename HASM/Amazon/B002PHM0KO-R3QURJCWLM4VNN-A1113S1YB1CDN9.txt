Title: Pretty and cool
Content:
Love my Vaio laptop. The wider screen is great for movies, and of course Sony has a great picture. It stays cool--it's been on for hours and is sitting comfortably on my lap. I'm not a big touch pad fan, but this one is easier to use than most. The keyboard has a good touch. In no way does it feel cheap or flimsy, and I have no noise from the fan.
It comes with Windows 7 (64 bit), so I recommend reading up on that before buying. Issues with Windows, IE and such are not directly related to the laptop. Do your research.
Only have two minor negatives: It does not have bluetooth, but I added that for a few bucks; and it does not have volume control, you have to use F keys. (I would knock off 1/4 star for these.)

Title: Horrible Warranty from DeLonghi
Content:
I bought two (2) DeLonghi EW7707CM Oil-Filled radiators. Both work fantastically-well, however one of them has started leaking - after less than a month of use.
I e-mailed Delonghi, told them what the issue was and now they say I have to send the product to "the nearest service center listed on our website under the customer service tab" which is almost 400 miles from my house and I AS THE CUSTOMER have to pay for shipping to this far-flung service center.
Ridiculous! It would cost almost as much in shipping as I bought it for ($49.95 through amazon) because of the weight and size of the unit.
Great product (when it isn't leaking oil), very very poor warranty. Buy from a more reputable company!!!

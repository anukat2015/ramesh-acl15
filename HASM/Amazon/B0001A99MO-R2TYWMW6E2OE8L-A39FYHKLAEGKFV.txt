Everyone raves about the iPod and the iPod Mini. Are they really worth the money? Abso-f-lutely. The only question you should be asking yourself is, "Should I get the iPod or the iPod Mini?"  I bought the 20GB iPod and used it for 6 months. Then I borrowed my roommate's iPod Mini and used that for a month. I ended up selling my iPod to buy an iPod Mini, and here's why.
It's all about portability. The Mini fits in my pocket so much better than the regular iPod. The Mini with the armband is so much more comfortable than the bigger iPod with the carrying case (Apple does not make an armband for the iPod because it is not practical; third-party armbands are available, but they are not comfortable at all). I find myself taking the Mini with me just about everywhere I go without a second thought; with the regular iPod, I always thought about whether I'll be comfortable carrying it or not.
As for the "limited" 4GB space, I prefer the 4GB to the 20GB. Instead of carrying around every single mp3 that I owned, I only carried around the songs that I wanted to listen to, which made the 4GB iPod Mini much more manageable than the 20GB iPod. If you think carrying around 1000 songs is limiting, then you have bigger issues (see a shrink about that).

Title: LOVE! LOVE! LOVE THIS COFFEEMAKER!
Content:
I bought my Cuisinart Coffee-on-demand three months ago, and the honeymoon isn't over, yet! Simple to operate; easy to clean (I run the reservoir through on the top rack in my dishwasher); the adjustable timer feature (up to 4 hours!)is great. The coffee stays hotter because the reservoir is contained in the sturdy body of the machine; you're not losing heat through a thin glass carafe. With the convenient pour spout on the reservoir, you can fill a carafe to easily serve company at the dinner table, although you do need to handle it carefully as the bail-type handle is warm. There are no drips or spills on my kitchen counter from a carafe with a fussy spout. Filling a taller to-go mug is the only draw-back, but you can usually tip back the machine slightly to accomodate their height. I recommend this coffee maker! 
UPDATE: March, 2008
We still love this coffeemaker! We drink a lot of coffee and any machine around our house has to earn its keep. This one is definitely a "keeper!"

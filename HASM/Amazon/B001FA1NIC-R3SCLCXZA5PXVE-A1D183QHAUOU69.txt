Title: Seems overpriced to me...
Content:
Would never buy it for myself, because Apple stuff is really only as popular as it is because of massive, expensive marketing, for which we all pay when we buy it...
Bought it for my Mom though, hoping she would use it with audio books. It's really not that easy to use for older people with all of the technical details and Itunes DRM crap. It's mostly an expensive paperweight to her...
Sorry i drank the cool-aid with the rest of the herd this time...

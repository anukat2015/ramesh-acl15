Title: amazing yet disappointing
Content:
My first opinion, because of the weight, was that this was a toy. Then I saw how much dirt it picked up. I was amazed. I used the machine twice, but the third time it wouldn't run. Checked the belt (which was somewhat difficult to get to) and it was off. Fixed it three times before it would stay on. Now I hear a rattling noise that wasn't there to begin with. The dust cup is difficult to empty, scattering dust wherever. The suction, however, still amazes me. I probably wouldn't buy it again.

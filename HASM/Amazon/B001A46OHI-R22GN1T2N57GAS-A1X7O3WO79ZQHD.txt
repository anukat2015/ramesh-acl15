Title: An okay heater for low, small spaces.
Content:
I got this heater to keep the people on my couch warm since our house is cold.  The heater works pretty well and outputs a moderate amount of heat.  However, due to it's small size it pretty much just sprays your feet with hot air.  For a sealed room this would probably work pretty well, but for an open space it won't work (unless you are laying on the ground.)

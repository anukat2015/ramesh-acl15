Title: Outstanding camera
Content:
Graduated up from an Olympus E-20 and this Rebel smokes it.  The user interface is outstanding, really top notch.  You can make quick changes on the fly to AF and white balance and ISO speed.  The ability to use interchangeable lenses is outstanding.  I put a Sigma 70-200mm lens on the Rebel and I get much better shots than ever before.  I am a believer that the lens is more inportant than the camera in what kind of pictures you get, but I wouldn't change my mind on starting my rig with a Rebel XTI.

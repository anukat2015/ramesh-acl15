Title: a good value product
Content:
This is the third vacuum of this model that I have bought, this one for my workplace (the other two are still working fine just in other locations). Especially for the price, this model is far more user friendly than the much more expensive one I am replacing at work. The suction is great, it's light weight with a long enough hose to vacuum overhead with having to lift the whole vacuum off the floor. It's easy to change bags, follows you without a struggle. These mighty might vacuums take a beating but keep going strong and hold together, they are amazing. It's the best canister vacuum on the market in my opinion.

Title: Fantastic Camera, Easy to Use and Capable
Content:
I used a lot of people's digital SLRs before finally deciding to buy this one for my own, and I couldn't be happier with the choice.  The camera is light and perfectly ergonomic.  Its menus are big, bright, and intuitive.  Its image quality is far better than the Canon digital Rebel and Rebel XT that many folks I know have.  Its use of SD memory, rather than compact flash is forward thinking.  Its lens selection is somewhat limited right now, but that will only get better, and the lenses that are available now are excellent and do cover the needs of virtually all amatuer photographers.  And the price for what you get absolutely can't be beaten by anything that competitors like Canon and Sony are offering right now.

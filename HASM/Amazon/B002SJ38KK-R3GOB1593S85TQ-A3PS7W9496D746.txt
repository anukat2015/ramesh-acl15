Title: Acer 1410-2039
Content:
I have had my Acer 1410-2039 for 2 weeks and I am pleased with both my purchase and Amazon transaction. I will agree with all of the previous reviews that this is by far a much better computer option then the ultra small netbooks that are offered for only minimaly less. However, it is still a small laptop that takes time to get used to. CPU speed, 2 GB memory, 250 GB HD, screen resolution, Windows 7 Premium, battery life, weight etc etc. are all as stated and perform better then expected. However, touch pad feels awkward due to the small case size. It's difficult to find that right hand / finger position simply because of the smaller configuration. Web cam works well but can be a little bit fuzzy depending on lighting conditions. Comes with very minimal information other then a quick start guide. Also as mentioned in most reviews the ultra gloss black finish is prone to fingerprints. Overall very satisfied with Acer quality and performance.

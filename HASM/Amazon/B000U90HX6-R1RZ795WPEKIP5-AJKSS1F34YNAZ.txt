Title: Love these heaters!
Content:
Bought this one with remote and two of the same with no remote.  This one heats a 300 sq ft kitchen and the other two heat a 550 sq ft living room.  All rooms have 10 ft ceilings.   We decided not to replace our central heat and use space heaters since it rarely gets below freezing here in SE TExas.  These work great.  We put in front of the large windows- they can be put right up against a wall.   Set the thermostat at about 68 and quickly takes the chill out of the air.  I am very happy with these.  I am going to buy one for every room in our house.  Very cost effective heaters with the digital thermostat and auto feature.  Buy.com has them for 79.99 with free shipping.

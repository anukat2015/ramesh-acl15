Title: Acer Aspire Timeline
Content:
The "Acer Aspire Timeline" has been a complete disappointment. I've given it two weeks and after the 30th time it crashed I have had it. freezing up, locking up, try and restart and it wont turn off. loads of bloatware and crap that had to be deleted and still running into problems. I'm not going to call tech support and spend hours trying to fix their product. Acer - your system should work out of the box and it just simply fails on every level.
I'm loading it back in the box it came in and its on the way to the post office on its return trip to Acer - Don't buy this product.

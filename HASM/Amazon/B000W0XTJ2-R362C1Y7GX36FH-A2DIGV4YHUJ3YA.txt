Title: Bad notebook, it dies after 15 months
Content:
I bought this notebook from Amazon on October 2007. I never got the finger print to work. It's very hot during the operation. Put on your lap is not recommended. Last month, it started acting up. When I put on sleep mode,
it died. I had to turn it off and turn it back on. For the last 30 days, I could turn it on once every 10 tried, and now it is dead completely, I could not turn it on again. I spent $1199.99 on this junk and it lasted only 15 months. I call HP support, and they said they could repaired it for $399.
I wouldn't recommend this notebook and I am not sure if I will buy an HP again.

Title: Great desktop replacement laptop
Content:
Got my Gateway computer quickly. The computer runs great and really fast i5 processor with a fast 1066mhz FSB and 4 GB DDR 3 memory. Big 17.3" screen. Win 7 seems to be pretty good. A few old programs and drivers won't update to 7. My 9 year old printer won't work and got a Lexmark wireless printer. Set up was quick and everything works great. Keyboard is comfortable but keys are flat. Laptop is large in size but light for it's size. Battery life is around 2 1/2 hours. Build quality is good and the price couldn't be beat by the competition. I got an HP wireless mouse with a tiny USB dongel. Worked as soon as I connected them together. The only weakness is the 128 MB integrated graphics and shared memory of around 1.7 MB. If you want to use the high end gamer games you will have to pony up around $150 more for the higher end model with the 1 MB graphics card. For the price this computer is a bargain.

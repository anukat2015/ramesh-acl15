Title: Bunn BTX-B Super coffe maker
Content:
After reading alot of bad reviews about this being hard to use without a huge mess I still ordered it because I had a previous model with a heater that lasted a long time. I'm very glad I did. I've had absolutly no problems with it. It also keeps the coffee very warm for at least a couple of hours or more. This is much better than my previous model that tended to burn if left on for over a couple of hours. As for the lid being hard to use there are arrows to line up on the lid and the carafe so you can get it on right every time. If I would suggest one improvement it would be to design the inside of the carafe with an indention at the spout so you could get the very last drop out easier. Don't be afraid of this product as I think it has gotten unjust reviews ( IMHO ) Also I took the time to pop the top off the old machine and found mineral deposites ( we're on a well ) which I was able to clean up in about half an hour and found it now makes a pot of coffee like when it was new. So now I have 2 Bunn coffee makers for parties, one regular and one caffein free.

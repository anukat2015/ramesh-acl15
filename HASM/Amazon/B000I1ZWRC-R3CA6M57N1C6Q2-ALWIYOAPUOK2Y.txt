Title: Canon Digital Rebel XTi ... a teriffic camera for beginners and professionals alike!
Content:
My Canon Digital Rebel XTi combines the creative enjoyment I experienced with my 35mm SLRs in the past with the convenience and versatility of digital cameras. Anyone from beginner through professional photographer will be pleased with its myriad capabilities and ease of use: beginners can start with the "automatic" functions and develope their skills as they experiment with the vast creative features and functions of the Rebel XTi.

Title: Great quality budget notebook
Content:
I bought this notebook as a gift.  The notebook came as described and shipped perfectly.  The LED lit screen is very sharp and visually pleasing.  The performance is what I expect from the Core 2 series.  4GB of RAM and 500 gig hard drive are great to have.  Windows 7 came installed and continues to run well.
One note to future buyers:  The "ASUS Accidental Damage Warranty" card that ships in the package contains the wrong address, and my first attempt to register this Notebook was returned by USPS.  Look up the correct address at:  [...].
Overall a great buy as well as a great notebook.

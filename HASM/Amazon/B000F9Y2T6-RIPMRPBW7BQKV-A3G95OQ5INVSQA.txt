Title: VERY DISSAPOINTED :-(
Content:
I have twins in high chairs throwing food on the floor for every meal, so I was really looking forward to this.  You are supposed to push the button for fluid when you push the vac. forward and the suctioning happens when pulling back.  
The problem is the squeegie on the front makes it hard to push it forward.  Also...the dry vac. portion is just o.k., not as good as I hoped.  Once you switch from dry to wet, you can't go back to dry to a different area/room as water will drip everywhere.  This was harder on my back than just doing it the old fashion method.  I am returning it.  And I so hoped this was going to make my life easier!  oh well.  hohoho.

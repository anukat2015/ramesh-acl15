Title: The D200 is Everything I Expected and More
Content:
I have been waiting for an affordable Nikon digital SLR on which I could use my older Nikon lenses (AI, Series E, etc.).  I know, I could have spent thousands on a D2, but that would have been overkill for me.  Suffice to say, the D200 is a joy to use.  It is fast, solid, and intuitive.  For those owners of Nikon film SLRs who are considering a D200, to me it "feels" just like a Nikon film SLR.  I have previously owned several high-end digital point and shoot cameras, and the D200 blows them away in terms of its capabilities, the degree of control it offers, and the resulting quality of the pictures you can take with it.  It has all the features an advanced amateur photographer could possibly want.  I'll probably never even scratch the surface of all of its features, but its nice to know they're there if I want or need them.  I highly recommend the D200 to anyone who, like me, has been waiting for the right digital SLR to come along.

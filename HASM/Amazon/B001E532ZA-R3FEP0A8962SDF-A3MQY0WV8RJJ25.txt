Title: HOT, convenient, tasty, we love it!
Content:
We love this machine!!! We have been fruitlessly searching for a coffee maker that would make HOT coffee.  For a long time, if we made coffee at home, I let the coffee stand on the brewer and cook to get hot.  It gets hot but it takes a half hour and tastes like tar no matter what beans you use.  Most days we would go to a coffee shop if we wanted real coffee.  My parents had been using the Keurig machines and loved them.  They do make hot coffee, but completely lacking in taste, AND they do not make espresso, cappuccino, or any other specialty drinks.  We needed good coffee.  We tried this machine at Bloomingdales and knew right away.  I've seen reviews saying it's loud but I really don't think so.  It's fast, precise, hot and very good.  It is VERY easy to clean as well.  I would and do recommend Tassimo and this particular machine.

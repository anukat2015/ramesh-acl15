Title: Total disapointment
Content:
I bought one of these from the Apple store, and the display was awesome. And that's where it ends. The battery life is about 4-5 hours, as opposed to 24-25 hours. Ridiculous! The artwork for the albums somehow can get mixed up, so when I am listening to ABBA Gold, the artwork to Korn: Untouchables shows. The cover flow is one of the most irritating aspects; I don't want to hold my Ipod totally erect while walking, but if it gets shifted to the side, the wheel no longer controls the volume but the album cover flow, and this can't be turned off. And the "shake the Ipod to change the song" rarely works. 
This is my second one, I thought I got a bugged one the first time. I am going to take this one back as well. 
Oh, I guess the purple color is beautiful. Oh well =P

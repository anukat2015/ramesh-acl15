Title: Super Classic
Content:
This percolator makes the best, hottest coffee, and it's very durable.  I have had mine (in great working order) for 15 years.  My grandmother has had hers (still working fine) for 35 years!  We've both had to replace the power cord once or twice.  But that's been its only repair. I make about 10 cups a day and I enjoy every drop!

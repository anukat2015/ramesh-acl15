Title: Ready Set (fix lid) Go
Content:
I like the coffee making part of the coffeemaker, but, like many reviewers have said, the lid is VERY loose. If the lid is on right, you can drink from it without dribbling down your chin, but it doesn't take much to knock the lid off of the cup. The cup itself looks good, and fits in my car cup-holder (a big plus, compared to those that have handles that get in the way). 
Overall, you can't beat the price for what you get. And you can use the coffeemaker top on any other travel mug. Melitta just needs to figure out how to make the lid a little tighter.

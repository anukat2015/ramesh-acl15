Title: Why do people unjustly  ruin the rating of a product?
Content:
Why do people ruin the rating of a product???
When their problem is with a seller (and not even Amazon).  I do own this camera but did not purchase it from this site.  So I thought I would do just to the excellent DR XT and give it 5 Stars here to help counter at least one of the "PRODUCT" Reviews that are actually reviewing a bad experience with a failed purchase.
Please do state your purchase experience and warn others of your mishap but it is not necessary to give the "PRODUCT" itself a bad rating and downplay the overall score.  Unfortunately, some people only look at the overall (average) rating of a product and will not even see why your "BAD REVIEW" was given.
Why not start your review with something like: 
***WARNING***   ***WARNING***   ***WARNING***
And, then state your message warning others about your purchase experience.  You can do this and still give the actual product the a rating in comparison with previous other actual product reviews that were written previously.  This way you are not misrepresenting the product itself.
Just my two cents while doing my part to help justify the product rating.

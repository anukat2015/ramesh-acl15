Title: This is Spoiling Us
Content:
My husband and I love good coffee but wouldn't usually splurge on something like a costly machine with the k-cups that seriously out-price beans per pound. But we're seriously getting spoiled.
My husband's recent health problems mean he can't drink regular straight. We started using decaf or making pots of regular/decaf mixes. And trying to remember what's in the pot. And he's never cared for flavored coffees, or at least not enough to make a pot. I think you see where I'm going...
After researching Amazon and elsewhere, got this machine and love it. This machine is instant gratification for us both!
The machine itself seems excellent: solid built, easy to use, different brew sizes, instant ready OR choice of ways to keep on/shut off.
Been reading the Amazon reviews of flavors and so far quite happy with the k-cups. We now brew a pot of half decaf/half regular in morning but at night it's k-cups: decaf french/bold roast types for hubby and flavored delights for me (like dessert replacements after dinner). And hubby's sips of my flavors may just mean we'll be ordering decaf flavors for him soon.
Also love the instant hot water! When I need a cup while cooking, this is great. And forget the tea k-cups for perfect tea! I've been using teabags. For LARGE cup, I use two of my Republic of Tea teabags, placing them in k-cup holder so they don't get pierced, then run the machine TWICE -- each time on the small cup size. I like strong tea so I then take the teabags and place them in the tea mug for one minute steeping.

Title: Cost effective transition to DSLR
Content:
Still not convinced that you need a DSLR? I spent a few years with various point and shoot digital cameras after giving up my old 35mm film cameras in the late 90s. I was using a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ5K 5MP Digital Camera with 12x Image Stabilized Optical Zoom (Black) prior to this and while the Lumix's Leica glass is hard to beat, I found the electronics to be a limiting factor in my picture taking.
I liked what I had heard about Olympus four thirds system:

and I picked up the E-500 in a store and really liked the feel - big and solid, which made my hands feel a tad smaller and the camera easier to use.
Anyhow, if you're not compelled yet, have a look here:

and browse some of the photos.
I found a number of things about this camera with the two lens kit to be to my liking:
1) Excellent low light performance
2) Usable flash on the camera - more powerful than it appears
3) Great ISO controls - the ability to limit ISO range and still use auto ISO mode
4) Excellent LCD
5) Superlative usability and feel
6) Works well with Linux - I use Ubuntu 7.10

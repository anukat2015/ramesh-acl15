Title: Good Laptop
Content:
I purchased this Laptop on August 26th and it arrived on August 28th; very speedy free shipping 
from Amazon I must say. 
This laptop is everything I thought it would be; it is extremely fast and while it is too soon 
to evaluate it I am satisfied with it.   
 
It came with Windows Vista Home Premium 64 bit installed and is eligible for Windows7 upgrade
The Intel Core Duo 2.1 GHz processor and the 4GB Memory make it very quick;
this notebook also has a relatively large 320GB 7200 rpm hard drive
It is worth much more than the $649.99 price I paid for it on Amazon shipping included
I have had little or no problems with Hewlett-Packard since I started using HP product ,Laptops, 
Desktops, Printer and Scanner many years ago.
All in all good value for money

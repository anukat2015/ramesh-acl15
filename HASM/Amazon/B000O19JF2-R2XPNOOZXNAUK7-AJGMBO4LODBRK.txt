Title: Great Value Camera
Content:
For the price, this is a fine camera. The 10 Megapixel sensor takes excellent images - and the camera is small and lightweight.
I purchased this body, and added the AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 18-70mm f/3.5-4.5G IF-ED Lens. Nice lens and with this body is a better value than the Canon XTi in my opinion - even these less expensive the Nikon lenses are better than the Canon lenses, and certainly the poor kit lens that the Canon XTi comes with.
I really want a Nikon D300, but that was not available when I made this purchase, and in fact, the D40x does nearly everything I need, is easy to use, and substantially less expensive than a D200 or D300. As I am not doing high volume work, the D40x is just fine.

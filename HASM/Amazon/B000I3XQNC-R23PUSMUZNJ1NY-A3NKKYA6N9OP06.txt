Title: Great entry level digital SLR
Content:
I purchased this camera in October to take on a trip, and it did not let me down.  This is a great entry-level digital SLR.  I bought the body only and purchased the Canon EFS 17-85mm lens with image stabilization.  I think it is a big step up from the lens included with the kit (I borrowed the base lens from someone to compare).  I previously owned the Canon Powershot G2, and I think the Rebel XTi is the next step up the line.
One observation for those used to framing the picture through the LCD, this is not the camera for you.  The Digital Rebel XTi requires you to frame the picture through the viewfinder.  I would recommend you do this regardless, but I know people that are confused (and even bothered) when they can't preview the picture in the LCD window.
To really get your money's worth, I would recommend that you purchase a field guide or take a class.  I was fortunate enough to find a class specific to the Canon Digital Rebel XTi.  This really helps  with understanding the advanced capabilities of the camera.  A good class also can improve your overall photography skills.

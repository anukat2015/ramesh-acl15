Title: Wow -- I love this coffee maker
Content:
I bought the Delonghi 14 cup coffee maker because, during a recent party, I wanted two pots, one for decaf and one for regular, instead of dragging out the urns that I use for larger gatherings.  Because I bought it without much research, I was afraid I'd hate it.  Instead, I couldn't be happier.  The coffee is about as good as you can get with an automatic drip, with a setting that slows the drip process for a more intense brew.  Even better, it makes 14 cups instead of the more usual 10 or 12 found with other brands.
The look is sleek retro and somewhat boxy; except for the handle, the carafe fits completely inside the unit, thus insulating it somewhat.  It has a programmable timer.  Inside, the wide mouth water reservoir has bright white steps to indicate the amount of water inside.  Although it doesn't come with a gold filter, it does have a reusable aluminum one in the cone-shape of Cuisinart, although it is much longer.  (Finding replacement parts for this coffee maker may be a problem.)  For those who are concerned about counter space, the base is 9" wide x 8" deep, with a height of 14".
All in all, this coffee maker offers both excellent value and flavor.  I highly recommend it.

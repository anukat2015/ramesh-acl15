Title: Good Buy
Content:
We bought this for a small den where we spend a lot of time. The room is frequently cold in the winter and hot in the summer. This little radiator is perfect for what we need -- it heats up quickly, makes no noise, and keeps the room very comfortable. Also, it is a great size and can be placed in the corner when not in use.

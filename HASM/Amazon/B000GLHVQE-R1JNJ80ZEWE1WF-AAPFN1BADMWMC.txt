Title: Not so hot
Content:
This is a cute room decoration. As auxiliary heat in a tiny room, it might even keep you warm. But as primary heat, in an average sized room, it's purely decorative. 
As I write this, I'm sitting less than three feet from the heater, which has been running all day. It's 61 degrees in this room, and I feel absolutely NOTHING coming from the heater. The floor directly under the heater is pleasantly warm, and standing over the heater, within a foot of it, you could warm yourself a little.  That makes this a pretty lame excuse for a heater. But the 'fire' illusion is amusing in a dark room (and ONLY in a dark room).
So in review, it's VERY cheap looking plastic. It's a dust magnet that has to be wiped down daily. It has to be disassembled when the light bulb that creates the image of 'fire' burns out, or when too much dust collects on the inside of the front plastic panel. The mirror that creates the 'fire' image reflects the colour of the floor unless, all the lights are turned off. It has no thermostat. And it won't keep you warm.

Title: great heater for small spaces
Content:
This heater works very well. It is easy to operate and really helps keep our large bedroom warm. We have a very open house and in the large open spaces it doesn't warm as well but in a single large room it does really do the trick. I saw in one review that they thought it was hard to use the space in the back to carry it but I found it very easy to use and portable - it might depend on the size of your hand. It is also very quiet - so that helps if you want to use it while you sleep. I also like the fact that it is a tower and not easily tipped over.

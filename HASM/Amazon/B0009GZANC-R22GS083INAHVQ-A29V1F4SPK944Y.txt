Title: Great entry-level DSLR
Content:
This is a great camera! I have used it for a 1-1/2 years and I love it. I am a free-lance journalist/artist/photographer and it works for everything except nighttime fires and dark interior shots with no flash. It is a bit slow for shots such as evening deer movement. I have gotten award-winning sunset/sunrise photos with this, as well as wonderful photos of my children both indoors and out. I have also used it for macro photography. For someone who wants an all around camera, this one is perfect -- it is fast, crisp and clear. The colors are wonderful. The kit lenses (18-55 and 55-200) are good. If you want to do serious wildlife photography, you will need to invest in a larger telephoto lens. I routinely enlarge photos I take with this camera to 11x14 with no loss of clarity. Buy a big sd card -- you'll be taking tons of photos!

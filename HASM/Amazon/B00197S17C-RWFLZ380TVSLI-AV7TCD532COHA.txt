Title: Best coffee maker at the given price
Content:
This is my first coffee maker. I have been a native tea drinker. I started drniking coffee since the past 6 months and bought Black and Decker as it is supposed to be a popular brand with coffee makers. I was amazed to find that Black and Decker had delivered a great product at the given price. The reusable permanent filter was a great add-on. It saved me couple of buks that I would have spent on paper filters. The coffee maker serves dual purpose because amazingly I can also brew light tea using the same filter.  The programmable option allows me to prepare coffee before I wake up and the machine keeps it warm for 2 hours before it shuts down. All in all I am very satisfied with the product.

Title: Good vac but what now that Hoover is bought out?
Content:
I bought this vacuum in hopes that it would be easier on my back that the Wind Tunnel self propelled I already have. So far it seems to be a pretty good product though the design on canister vacs necessarily causes tremendous wear on the hose. (You have to pull the thing about by the hose.) So I have modified it with a strap that is slightly shorter than the hose and I pull it by that strap. I clean the dust bin and filter out with my big shop vac.
My main concern is of course that the company no longer exists. It was bought out a couple of days after I ordered my S3765.  Will Whirlpool or whoever bought Hoover out honor the warranty? Can I still get filters when I need them. TIME will tell.

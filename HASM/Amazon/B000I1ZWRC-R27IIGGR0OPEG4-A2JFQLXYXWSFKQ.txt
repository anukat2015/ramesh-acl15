Title: in LOVE!
Content:
I just received this camera yesterday and I LOVE it. I had played around with a few cameras at Best Buy before deciding which SLR I would purchase and I've always had a connection with the Canon. It's pretty "user-friendly" and helps me take beautiful pictures. The images are very sharp and the automatic sensor cleaning makes it even better! I would recommend this camera to anyone, even those who aren't interested in making a career of photography but like to take a lot of family/friend photos.

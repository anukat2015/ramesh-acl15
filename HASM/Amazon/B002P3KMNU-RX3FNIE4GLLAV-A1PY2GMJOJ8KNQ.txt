Title: So far I love it!
Content:
I have this computer for only 2 days. Usually I wait at least one month to write reviews, but because I almost didn't buy this computer based on the mixed reviews, I thought I would post my initial opinion.
I wanted an ultra portable computer that wouldn't brake the bank, and even though I love Toshibas, their T135 series is just a joke... So I decided I wanted an Asus ul30a-a2. Here are some of the concerns I had and the impression I have so far: 
#1 - Internal wireless card. 
I almost decided not to buy because of this. But after setting it up, the internet worked without any issues (and I have a -really- crap modem which is far away from the main place I use it). I read the amazon forum and saw a rep from asus mentioning they would fix the problem, and I thought, oh well, let's try. No problem to be fixed here.
#2 - Max 4G RAM... I wouldn't mind paying a bit more or have a few ounces/inch added to the machine and be able to upgrade to 8G... that's was my major frustration about this machine in terms of its specs. But this was easy to decide, as well as the lack of optical drive - it's all in the computer specs
#3 - All the complains about the touch pad. I love it! My old laptop has a great pad, and I was a little apprehensive (this is the first computer I buy online before seeing it). It's easy to use, sensitive, and you don't need to use the mouse buttons at all! I haven't even tried the mouse buttons yet! Touch the pad with 3 finger: right click! The scroll options are neat too.
And, just to remind the buyer, all my VISA credit cards will double the manufacturer warranty. This is a ton of value added to the machine.
I will update this post after a while using this machine, but I am in love with it!

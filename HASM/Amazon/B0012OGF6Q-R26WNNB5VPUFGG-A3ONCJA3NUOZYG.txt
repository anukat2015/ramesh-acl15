Title: Awsome Camera!!!
Content:
I researched cameras for months before I bought this one.  My mom got a D40 for christmas from my dad that I played with before I ultimatley decided to stick with Nikon.  This camera has excelent performance in most all kinds of environments.  The only thing that I have not mastered yet is shooting at dusk or in low light/evening outdoor shots.  I recently took over 5,000 shots at an airshow that 98% of the Photos came out perfectly.  I added the Nikon AF-S 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED DX VR [Vibration Reduction] Zoom-Nikkor Lens + Hoya UV Haze Filter - Accessory Kit for Nikon D40, D40x, D60, D80, D200 & D300 Digital SLR Cameras (Lens Refurbished by Nikon USA) that shoots perfectly.  The lenses switch easily and the camera has no issues with them.  I preordered a book from David Busch's Nikon D60 Guide to Digital SLR Photography.  This has a lot of information on how to take the pictures like a pro.

Title: Sony warranty is not customer friendly
Content:
I purchased an FW laptop in November 2008 and the keyboard failed in August 2009.  Service was responsive and replaced it.  In January 2010., keyboard failed again and Sony will not cover since the computer is "out of warranty".  I have another brand that is still working after 8 years.  One year life is outrageous!

Title: Doesn't wash well!
Content:
My kids really love their Sansa Shakers!  It's great to have the option of the earbuds or the speaker.  I just wish my 5 year old hadn't tucked his away in his pants pockets and then later threw them down the laundry chute - I unfortunately didn't notice till removing them from the washer and by then it was too late for the little music player!  I was thrilled to see that the price has come down by 1/3 since I am back for a replacement.

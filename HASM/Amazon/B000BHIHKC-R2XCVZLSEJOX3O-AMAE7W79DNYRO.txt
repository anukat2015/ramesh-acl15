Title: Works well, great price - I bought TWO!
Content:
It works beautifully -- and the price is terrific!  After using this item at home for a few weeks, I ordered a second one for my office.  Tea bags work just as well as pods, so I can enjoy my favorite green tea, which isn't available in pod packaging.  I also found ways to use products I already had on hand.  For example, I use a small piece of paper towel to line the pod holder, then empty powder from 2 or 3 cranberry capsules onto the paper.  What I end up with is delicious cranberry tea!

Title: Incredible!
Content:
I'm truly quite amazed at the caliber of coffee this machine makes.  I drink coffee black, so it has to taste good to be drinkable.  The Kona coffees for this machine are perfect, in my opinion.  We are using it in a cigar shop where all of the customers have discerning palettes and every one of them praises the coffee.  It is very well built and I do not foresee it breaking down any time in the future, even with use all day long, six days a week.  The only problem I have with the entire machine is that using a smaller 9oz mug, there is a bit of splash which can get annoying because of how nice the machine looks.  In leu of this, it brews so quickly that I have no problem holding the mug close to the nozzle while it does its magic.  It may seem expensive, but it is well worth the money.

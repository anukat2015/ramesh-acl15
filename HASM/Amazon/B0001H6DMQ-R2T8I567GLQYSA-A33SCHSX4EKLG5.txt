Title: good solid workhorse
Content:
This inexpensive vacuum cleaner does the job.  It has good suction and draws dirt and accumulation away.  I am remodeling so it has been put to the test.  I like not having to have bags to change.  It empties easily.  I am a little disappointed in the way it follows since it does get hung up at corners and on table legs.  That may be because of the big wheels.  However, I am very please with the cleaning and for a very reasonable price.

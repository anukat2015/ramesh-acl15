Title: Careful ... Dangerous Fire Hazzard
Content:
I had this heater several years ago. It lasted less than 2 years. I am not sure why it is being sold for $100 now when it only cost $39.99 at the local hardware store with big orange letters when I bought it. Anyhow, after about 2 seasons, the "ceramic" discs began to disintegrate inside and crumble. You could actually hear the broken off pieces rumbling around inside when you picked up the heater to move it. Eventually it began huffing out a very suspcicious burning smell whenever it was on. Tossed it into the dumpster. This heater is junk. I have an oil filled radiator from this company for about 5 years now and it gives off a lot of heat and works well, but the switch is beginning to distintegrate much like the ceramic discs in this heater. My guess is that they manufacture cheap junk. I wouldn't buy their products again.

Title: Good for a year: UPDATE
Content:
I contacted Brawn.  Even though the warranty had just expired, they did honor it and fixed my coffee maker at no charge.  Kudos to Braun.
This is the first time I've written a product review.  I've found them helpful so I want others to know what I've experienced with our Braun KF590E coffee maker.  A week ago I would've given the product 4 or 5 stars.  The only problem we had with it at that time was that we had to pour the coffee slowly or coffee would drip on the counter.
Yesterday, 12 days after the warranty expired, our coffee maker went totally dead after making a pot of coffee.  The authorized service centers are nowhere near and Braun customer service is closed for the weekend.  I hope to get this problem resolved through Braun next week but doubt that I will be able to do so.  I would've expected a coffee maker at this price to last more than a year.

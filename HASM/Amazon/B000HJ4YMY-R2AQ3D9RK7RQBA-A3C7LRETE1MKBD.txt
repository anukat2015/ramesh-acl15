Title: Loving it !!
Content:
I have had the D80 for 3 months now, and am totally loving it.  I use the 18-55mm kit lens, the inexpensive 50mm/f1.8 prime and 70-300mm VR lens.  The only challenge I am facing is with getting the expensive 105mm f/2.8 VR lens, as the cheaper AI-S lenses do not meter with D80.
If you expect to use a large number of specialised lenses, you may want to consider the D200/D300, as they would allow metering with the older AIS lenses.  
It would have been nice for Nikon to actually disclose the useful life of the shutter, and its replacement cost.

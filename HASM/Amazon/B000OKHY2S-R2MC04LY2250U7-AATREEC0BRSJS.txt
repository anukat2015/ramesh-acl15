Title: Good price and does the job great!
Content:
Was originally looking for a in room air conditioner but decided to get the cooler because of the power savings and the humidifying factor.  I live in Phoenix, Az and the air gets so hot and dry that this unit was a perfect fit. It even comes with a remote!

Title: I love it
Content:
I owned the Dyson DC5 when I lived in the uk but when I moved to California I only had carpet in two rooms and so opted for a cheaper vacuum cleaner. After 3 years of having to dust the house on a daily basis I decided enough was enough and bought the DC21. It is great..better than the DC5 and just in a total different league to what I had. Now I vacuum everything, piano, computers, ceilings and I don't have to do any dusting again for about two weeks..it's amazing. I have realied that I have just been re-distributing the dust for the past three years. I love this vacumn cleaner. It is small and neat. I have found the cable, although on the short side, it reaches everywhere I just have to change the sockets more regularly. The dusting tools are great. The only downside I have found so far is the fact that it is difficult to dust at mid height level due to the stiff hose at the top end. That is a minor issue though so I'm leaving it at 5 stars. Love it, love it, love it. You won't believe the amount of stuff that comes up from your carpets.

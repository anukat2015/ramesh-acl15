Title: Don't bother
Content:
We've gone through a couple Cuisinart Grind and Brews, both were junk. They need to be cleaned completely between uses and they are a pain to clean. They begin to leak after only a couple years and then need to be replaced. The door with the basket will occasionally pop open half way through the cycle so you can wake up to coffee all over the counter. This coffeemaker is a total waste of money. We acquired a Melitta Mill and Brew that is vastly superior but it doesn't appear to be available anymore, pity.

Title: Quiet, lightweight, compact
Content:
Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater with Adjustable Thermostat I was pleased with this product.  It is quiet, compact, and has a variety of heat settings.  I use it to dry my dogs after their bath.  Better than having to stand over  them with the noisy hair dryer.  They love it.

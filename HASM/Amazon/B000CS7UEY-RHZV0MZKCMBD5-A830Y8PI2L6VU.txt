Title: Zen Vision M is a superior player.
Content:
I was choosing between the Ipod video or Zen Vision M (ZVM).  Frankly, I really didn't care whatsoever about which player I bought - Ipod or ZVM; I just wanted the "better" one (Toshiba Gigabeat S was out of the question due to reliability problems and short battery life).
Now that I have the ZVM, here are the reasons why I bought the ZVM over the Ipod.  The ZVM has:
*Longer battery life - ZVM video lasts about 4 hours - which is twice as much as Ipod. As a result, I don't have to worry about the player running out of juice at the end of a movie like with the Ipod video.  Also, it's just nicer to have longer battery life.
*Digital camera storage - The ZVM can directly store my photos from my digital camera so that I don't need to bring along a computer to store my photos when I travel - just plug my camera to the ZVM, download photos, then erase my camera's card to take more pictures.
*Hard drive capabilities - The ZVM acts like a hard drive.  Just plug to a computer and download what you need.  For example, I can go to my friend's computer and copy all the music/video/etc files I like with drag-and-drop ease. Also, I can now store very large PowerPoint files on the ZVM so that my work presentations have a better bang - and I get better results.
*Multiple file format support - The ZVM plays a lot of video file format's that I already have such as divx, xvid and WMA.  This is not a major issue to me however because even with an Ipod, video/audio conversion is not a big deal - just an extra step.
*Software ease-of-use: With the ZVM, I don't have to rely on iTunes to get files loaded onto the player.  Itunes program isn't bad, but sometimes I think it is a little cumbersome.  Currently, I just use Windows Media Player and/or the regular Windows XP Explorer interface.
*Better screen: The ZVM has a better screen than the video Ipod. For example, the ZVM has 260+k of colors vs. 65k on the Ipod. The difference is readily seen with the ZVM having more vibrant colors and a less washed-out appearance.
*Accessory support: For $25.00, Amazon.com sells a combo that includes an AC adaptor, car charger adaptor, direct USB cable (no need for included ZVM dongle), and a battery pack (uses 4-AA batteries) for those long flights.  
*Cheaper:  The ZVM is priced much less than the Ipod.
*FM Radio: Despite a large library of songs, it's nice to be able to hear fresh music over the radio.
*Recording capability: The ZVM can record FM radio.  But for me, I like the fact that I can put my BlackBerry on speakerphone and then use the ZVM to record the conversation for business legal and future reference.
*Short-cut key and easy navigation:  The short-cut key is great; I have mine set to the microphone record function.  I haven't had any problems with the ZVM's navigation on screen.
*Multiple subscription service support: Although I haven't used them all, I hear the music subscription support is great. For example, I heard that with Yahoo (at least for your 1st month), you can pay $15 and download all the music you want.  What a deal.
*Customizable EQ: The ZVM has preset EQs also, but I prefer to set the EQ my way.
Despite these features that the ZVM has, there are a few shortcomings.  For example, I wish the ZVM was thinner for the amount of hard drive space it has.  I purchased the 30GB simply because it was thinner than the 60GB, although I'd prefer 60GBs.  
When the thin 60GB comes out, I'll be buying that and ebaying my 30GB.  I've found that the thickness of the 30GB is the max thickness I would want to have in one of these media players.  However, with the 30GB ZVM, I don't mind the extra thickness over the Ipod - probably because I don't notice the difference.  Maybe it's because the difference is marginal or that the 30GB Ipod and 30GB ZVM weigh the same.
If I could choose one word for the ZVM, it would be - versatile.  I'm not a Creative fanboy or anything. I just like the features the ZVM has.  If in the future, the Ipod has all the above features and remains thin with 60+ or more GB, I'd would be buying the Ipod.
For now however, I'm more than satisfied with the ZVM.  It's a great all-around media player.

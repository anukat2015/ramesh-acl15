Title: Not Too Pleased...
Content:
Not too pleased, so far.  CONS:  Several of my programs won't work with Windows Vista 64-bit.  Many of my favorite websites won't work with Vista 64-bit or Internet Explorer 8, both on this computer.  The mouse pad/mouse buttons are quirky, imprecise, difficult to use (despite repeated adjustments) and often unresponsive.  The mouse buttons are harder to push than normal, especially for someone with arthritis.  The strangely textured mouse pad gets very warm, also feels staticky, which during use, seems to make my thumb/finger feel somewhat numb/tingly.  (Never had that happen before.)   The keyboard glares terribly, which is distracting and makes it very difficult to use, especially for those who need to look at the keys occasionally.  It is also slippery when typing, causing errors. (Never had that problem before.)  Don't like the glossy texture, at all, as it ALWAYS looks terribly "fingerprinty" and dirty, no matter what I do!  I bought a 16" screen, so it would appear slightly bigger and easier to see, than my 15.4" screen (paid extra), but in fact the 16" screen is 1/2 inch SHORTER than my other one and only 5/8 inch wider.  Not worth the extra money; harder to see.  Also, there are several dead pixels on screen.  Lastly, slower than I expected, full of junk software, no rescue disks (better make your own, first thing!), Toshiba customer service is terrible, the caps lock light is difficult to see and several of the plugs/ports are flimsy.  PROS:  The speakers seem nice.  It has an S-video port, which was a main reason for this purchase.  Don't think I would order this computer again.

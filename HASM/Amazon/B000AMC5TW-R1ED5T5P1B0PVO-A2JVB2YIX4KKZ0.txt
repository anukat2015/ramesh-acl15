Title: should have bigger forced air fan
Content:
Cadet #67507 2000W Wall Fan Heater  Plenty of heat, wish the forced air fan was bigger.  If I were to buy one again I think I would have gone with the next size bigger from Cadet. I have one in my family room and love it, this one just doesn't blow the hot air. I worry about it over-heating.

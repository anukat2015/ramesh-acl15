Title: Trips breaker
Content:
I have bought several things from amazon and have always been happy.  I bought this heater for Christmas to heat my sun porch.I read all the reviews and noticed the one stars.  I decided totake a chance and buy one.  Unfortunately, I too got a defectiveone.  It too shuts off after about five minutes.  I have it plugged into a surge protector and after a few minutes it tripsthe fuse on the surge protector and shuts off.  Vornado obviously has a problem they need to correct.  I have not triedto return it yet but based on previous purchases with Amazon, I'm sure I won't have a problem.  I think I will try a differentmodel.  This could be (probably not) a hazard.

Title: great little device
Content:
I purchased it for use during running and biking. It's great... don't even know it's there. The sound quality seems to be pretty good. I'm no audiophile, and I'm using Sony headphones made for working out, that wrap around the ear, so I'm not using any headphones made for stellar audio quality, but using the same headphones, I've had 2 other mp3 players, and this one definitely sounds better... deeper sound.
I messed around a little with with a radio show download, and tried to use the bookmark feature that should work for audiobooks. Their site says I should be able to get this to work, but I haven't figured it out yet. So far, only wasted about an hour on it. It would be good if that was easier to manage, but that's not why I bought it, so I'm not too worried about it.

Title: Problems Syncing and Updating Firmware
Content:
Ok ... So this thing is about 2 weeks old and there's already a "firmware update?"  Mine wouldn't finish updating after waiting 45 minutes.  I loaded my whole music library in less time than that.  Now every time I try to sync, it just hangs.  Looks like I'll have to be doing a hard reset.  Too bad ... it played pretty well the 1st couple of weeks.  Maybe I'll find a place for it on craigs list or ebay.

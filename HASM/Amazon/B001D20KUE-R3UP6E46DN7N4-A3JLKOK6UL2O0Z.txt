Title: I Love it!
Content:
The product comes in two days! The appearance actually looks better than the pictures online. (It's light and cute!) (At least it looks better than I expected). I'm satisfied with the quality of the sound. It's awesome. I like the overall design although the upload software isn't quite user friendly. I think with the price I paid, it's really worth it with adequate expectation. (of course, comparing the price you paid for the ipod to judge this won't be fair.)

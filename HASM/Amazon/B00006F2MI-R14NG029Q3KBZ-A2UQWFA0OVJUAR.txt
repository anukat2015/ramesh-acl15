Title: I'm buying it again
Content:
I'm replacing our exact replica of this coffee maker today. Well, not EXACT because our original had a glass carafe and this time I'm going thermal.  We've had the coffee maker for several years.  Yes, SEVERAL years. 
Yes, it does sound like a 747 landing in your kitchen every morning but that problem with bolting upright in bed and the related involuntary twitching you develop will soon fade away.
It makes great coffee. 
My husband is a total coffee slob. He's very fastidious in every other aspect of his life (okay, maybe not in shed-organization either) but still remains a coffee slob. He rarely cleans the thing. When I finally break down to do it, the coffee maker is completely a mess.  BUT IT MAKES GREAT COFFEE!
After several years, yesterday it decided to only marginally grind the beans--in stops and starts, and the door pops open at odd times (probably from aforementioned slobbishness).  So here I am buying a new one. Probably not the stainless.  You people who insist on stainless are a mystery to me! Why add MORE work? Are you a magpie that likes shiny things? Just don't get it. But have at it.  The coffee maker is great.

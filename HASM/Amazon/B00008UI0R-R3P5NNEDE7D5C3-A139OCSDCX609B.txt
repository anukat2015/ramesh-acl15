Title: Good, while it lasted (which was not too long)
Content:
This vacuum worked well initially, but then the hose got clogged with junk.   We cleaned it out, and it started working well again.  Unfortunately now it has died out completely...the one year warranty expired about two months ago!!!  Next time, I will buy the extended warranty.   This is the third Hoover I've had problems with.  They all have lasted just past the one year!!! We have no pets or such, so I guess it's just bad luck.  No more Hoovers for our family.

Title: Good Coffee Maker
Content:
Great coffee maker with nice features. Makes great tasting coffee. Also very easy to clean. I did have to get a replacement though because my other one broke after about a year. It just wouldn't turn on. Besides that, I have no other complaints. Good choice for a coffee maker, not a cheap one and not that expensive.

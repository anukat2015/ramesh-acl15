Title: Nice but slow brewer
Content:
Received this timely and was impressed with the looks etc.  When making a pot of coffee, you have time to first go to the bathroom, take your medications, empty the trash can curb side, sweep the front and back porch, start a batch of pancakes and then your coffee is ready.  It is S l o w.  It brews well, cleans well. The lid is tricky to the big pot and fits just so.  If it brewed faster it would be a 5 star product

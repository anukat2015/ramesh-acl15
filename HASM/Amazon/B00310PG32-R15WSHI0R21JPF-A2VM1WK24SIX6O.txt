Title: Don't buy this computer
Content:
I have had several HP computers before this one but this one is a lemon.  I can barely write a review of it here as it has intermittent problems that deactivate the wireless and also place base and treble windows on the screen which stops all work until they disapear- There it goes again twice since I started writing this review.  If I could I would send this computer back and still might try if I cannot find a fix for this. I have been waiting for HP to acknowledge the fact that this has problems. I call them and when I do not get a tech support from India who assures me that nothing is really wrong, I get someone who tells me it is a software problem and that it must have corrupted drivers. That has not worked either.  This machine (and I got the most expensive of this series), is the slowest machine I have had since windows 5. My windows xp HP laptop runs faster than this one. I have been told by my knowledgeable friend that a lot of this is because I should never have gotten 64 bit windows on this machine. This may be right but the intermittent on and off of touch controls when I do not touch them, and the ... oops there it has turned off my wirelss again! Has to be a design flaw.  This is a lousy machine and I recommend not buying it. I sure wish I had not.  I have never written a review before but this computer has driven me to warn you.

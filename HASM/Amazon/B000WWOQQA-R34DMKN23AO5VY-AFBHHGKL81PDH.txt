Title: A good machine!
Content:
I have had this laptop for 2 years and it has been an excellent performer at everyday use. I am reading the negative reviews and cannot help it not to notice that the biggest problem of the computer is sometimes is the owner who would not be happy with any brand. 
This machine is very powerful for what I paid for it, and even after two years still remains very competitive on the market. I am somehow unhappy with Visa though but not to the extent that it would make me to go and buy Windows 7. Just a few annoyances that one can get used to.
What concerning the hardware I wish the battery ( I have an extended capasity battery )lasted a little longer.
But taking into account that this is a 17" laptop it is more customary to see in a static environment where the battery is not the most important component. 
Otherwise I have zero complains and would buy it again.

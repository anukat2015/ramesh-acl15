Title: Efficient, well made
Content:
You can spend $180 and buy a heater that provides more output, but as an all around appliance this is as good as I've seen for the following reasons:
1)  The heat is sufficient to take the chill off an early morning living room where the outside temps are in the low 40's.
2)  The fan noise at maximum is barely noticeable from a few feet away.
3)  The unit is very well made of well formed heavy gauge sheet metal (steel) for everything accept the top, glass door and some internal parts.  It looks like a small wood/coal stove or maybe even more like a pellet stove.  
4)  It's easily portable moving from room to room if needed (no bathrooms, or use outdoors).
5)  The flame/burning coal effect is very realistic.... much more so than the more common log sets seen in competing units.
6)  It looks like a "real" heating appliance rather than some piece of cosmetic junk that passes for "consumer goods" these days.
Obviously, I'm pleased with the unit.  It doesn't replace a forced air unit, but for a portable heater it more than met my expectations.

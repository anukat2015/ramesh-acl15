Title: Fire hazard - I'm returning it
Content:
I just received this and plugged it in.
It has been sitting on the bare hardwood floor in my living room for over an hour.  When I turned it on, it measured the room temperature at 60 degrees;  I set it to 75 degrees and now, an hour later, it is 70 degrees.  While it does put out hot air from the front, it seems to put out cold air from the top - since it's on the floor next to me, my feet are warming up but I am getting a blast of cool-ish air on my face.
I noticed that the cord and plug have become very warm (but not hot).  I also noticed a very slight burning smell, but I believe this came from the unit, not from the plug.  I have turned it off and I am returning it because I have never had another appliance where the cord and plug warmed up like that, and I think it's improperly wired.

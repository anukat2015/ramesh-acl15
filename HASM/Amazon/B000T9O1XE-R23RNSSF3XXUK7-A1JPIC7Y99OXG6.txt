Title: price dripped too fast
Content:
I bouhgt this mp3 player because it's so adorable and I thought the kids would love it very much. Indeed, they did except there is the only problem I am not satisfied about. Amazon dropped 1/3 price just right after I purchased. This kind of thing is always letting me down and usually if I buy in a store, I will go back to the store asking for price adjustment. But this didn't work for Amazon. I know Amazon used to have 90-days price guarantee, but they amended. Some friends suggested me to found out defective and return it then purchase again. I just wouldn't do so, this is not good for business. What can I say. Lovely Sandisk product, but my loss.(I love Amazon's service except this issue.)

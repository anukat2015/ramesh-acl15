Title: There is a product recall.
Content:
I received this message direct from the Manufacturer
The DVH  is subject to our Heater Recall  that was announced last year Aug 3, 2004. and should be sent in and repaired before you use it again. 
If you still hold in your possession a Vornado DVH, EVH,  IntelliTemp or VH heater, we are most interested in having it sent to our factory to be serviced and the potentially defective part replaced. We are providing free shipping via FedEx both to us and back to the owner. 
To Register your product for free shipping and repair, you must call 1-888-221-5431.  You will need to know BOTH The Model  & Serial Number of the Heater ( which is only on the Bottom of the Heater itself) and also we will need the following information. Your Name, Street Address, City, State, Zip, Phone Number (with Area Code first).

Title: Provides Quality Pictures
Content:
I decided to switch from my handycam to something more sophisticated like this one. I am happy with my purchase. It takes quality pictures, the clarity is amazing, focus has a much wider span that I expected, the LCD screen is pretty big. The zoom could have been a little better but thats okay. I have bought Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.

Title: Lasted a year and you cannot contact customer support
Content:
I have purchased 3 of these players for myself and others.  2 of them have died within the past week, the third is newer so we will see how long that one lasts.  Cannot get in touch with customer service.  One day i put them on speaker and 45 minutes later, I finally hung up.  I went out and purchased the Sony walkman- which I LOVE.  Napster is so much better to use than the Zune software, it may not be as pretty but its easier and more convenient.  Napster gives actual suggestions with every search you make and you can research Billboard top 100 by year.  I'm happy my Zune no longer works cause I was able to switch to a much better product.  My only regret was buying my mother a Zune for christmas.

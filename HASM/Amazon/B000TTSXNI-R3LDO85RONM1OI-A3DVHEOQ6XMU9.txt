Title: Quiet, well-designed
Content:
Heated my office well; the built-in five-temperature-option thermostat and included remote control made it very easy to moderate what was a bitterly cold atmosphere into a pleasant working environment.  I've used it to heat small offices and conference rooms, and though the blown air is not blisteringly hot (85 degrees maximum), I felt it was a good purchase for me.  In addition, the ceramic heating elements are hidden by a plastic guard and fan, so there is no accidental burn hazard.

Title: Now buying my second Wind Tunnel
Content:
The title kind of makes you think what happened to the first one huh!!!!! Well, I am a clean freak and I have Used my wind Tunnel nearly Every day for the last 3 years, and it just started going wrong about two weeks ago.  The elctronics have started to go bad in the handle (Through fault of my own as I had many times lets the handle fall to my tiled floor with a bang!)  So here I am buying the exact same Vacuum, because I love it so much.  I have two dogs and two kids, and the Wind Tunnel has been brilliant.  Its amazing how much it picks up.  You can vacuume your carpet twice, empty the canister, and then go over again, and it still picks loads up! (OK that sounds bad too, because I bet you are thinking it should have picked it all up the first time...but it gets way deep into the fibers of your carpet)  Theres no comparison.  Way better than any dyson I have used for sure.  I personally think the Dyson is over priced and way inferior to this little machine!

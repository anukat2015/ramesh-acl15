Title: Waited so long for it, but disappointed........
Content:
I had a Canon DRebel 300D for 1.5 years before I finally upgraded to the Nikon D80.  I waited SOOOOOO long for this camera!  I was so excited to get it!  Well right off the bat I noticed the focus was off on the camera.  I had an 85mm lens (I previously shot with a 50mm) so I thought maybe it was a focal length/shutter speed issue.  Then I started noticing metering issues....so many of my pictures were either seriously over or underexposed.  Again, I attributed it to user error.  But it kept happening and finally I googled the D80 and metering problems and VOILA!  It would appear there are quite a few of us struggling with this.  Ken Rockwell actually has a good article on the D80 where he addresses these issues.
My camera works well as a studio camera (with strobes) but is very inconsistent for natural light photography.  This is a huge disappointment for me.  I find myself using my old Rebel to shoot often and that's just sad after spending so much money on a new camera.
This camera could be great if they worked out the "bugs".

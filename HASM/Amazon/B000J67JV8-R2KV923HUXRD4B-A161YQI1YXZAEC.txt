Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
Needed a new vacuum and lots of great reviews for this one.  My experience just didn't seam quite as good.  We got the first unit home and there were parts missing.  You have to put the handle and Cord storage pieces on your self.  The item didn't have any screws to do this so I took that one back for a new one.  The new one did come with the screws but the brush would only work for about 30 seconds then stop.  If you waited a few minutes, it would start working again.  When it did work, it worked like a charm but I can't stop every 30 seconds to wait 2 minutes... I don't know if it overheated or was faulty but it would work and then, out of no where, stop. So, third time's a charm, I went back and got one more.  The last one, the brush switch wouldn't turn off the brush.  By now, I've had it.  I took the last one in and just got the Dyson DC25 Animal.  Hasn't stopped working... yet...

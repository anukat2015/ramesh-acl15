Title: Loud but cheap
Content:
Having read some of the reviews here, I was led to believe that this heater was not "too" loud. However, this product sounds like a small jet engine.
I happen to have some unfortunate expertise in noise detection. Due to having been a stupid 20-year-old who thought he was going to be a rock star (not implying that I am now smarter than everybody else), I have bilateral hearing loss and wear two hearing aids, so one cannot accuse me of having oversensitive ears. Nevertheless, the noise level on these units is excessive, far more than similar heaters. 
My wife is still a musician. Because she is smarter than I, she always protected her ears and still has very sensitive hearing. If your spouse has sensitive ears, please search elsewhere.
In any case, if noise is a concern for you, keep searching.
Any product is comprised of three general components: materials, labor, and transportation to the retailer. Sometimes, there are middlemen, adding to labor (handling) and transportation costs. A basic forced-air space heater needs a housing, fan, heating element, and wiring and electrical controls (electronics). 
That leaves labor and transportation. Since most products are made in China, they have to be shipped halfway around the world to get to America, about as far as a product can travel, if it comes directly from factory to retailer.
To make a $20 heater, materials must be cheap. The fan bearings are the biggest reason a forced-air space heater is either noisy or quiet. So simple logic indicates that cheap space heaters will more likely be noisy. I should have reasoned this out in the first place!

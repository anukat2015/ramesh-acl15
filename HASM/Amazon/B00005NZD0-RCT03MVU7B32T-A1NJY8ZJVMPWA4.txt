Title: You get what you paid for
Content:
The first thing I have noticed after it arrived, is that the metal base that heats up was scratched all over. After two times, the machine was used, the frother died. Considering the fact that it was a gift from me, I ended up looking like a complete idiot. The whole thing reminds me of a child's toy, looks and feels very flimsy. The bottom line is "You get what you paid for," get something more expensive.

Title: Adequate but won't stay in the wall outlet
Content:
I agree with the Jan 18, 2005 review; the heater does not stay in the wall outlet.  It falls out when you turn the knob to turn it off/on or after a few seconds on (from vibrations).  It was our second time purchasing this model; the first one from a couple of years ago did not have this problem.

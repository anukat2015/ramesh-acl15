Title: liked it so much that i bought another one
Content:
i love this little vacuum.  we have 2 cats and a 95lb yellow lab that shed all over the house.  we have hardwood floors and area rugs so hair and lint are everywhere.  this vacuum does a good job on both the rugs and the bare floors. almost all of the rugs have fringe and i can turn off the rotating brush bar so that the vacuum doesn't eat the finge the way my old one did.  the head of the vacuum is thin enough to get under almost any piece of furniture to seek out those dust/hair bunnies.  we have a vacation spot at the beach where our pets go with us; at that house i have the addition of sand to the floor mix.  so i bought a second one for that house.  works great on that mess, too!  my only complaint and the reason that i didn't give it 5 stars is that i have a hard time finding the bags.  i have to order them from [...].  other than that,  it's great.

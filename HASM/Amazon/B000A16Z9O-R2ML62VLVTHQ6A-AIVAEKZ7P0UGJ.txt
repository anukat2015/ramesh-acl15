Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I bought the Soleus thinking that quality comes from the price and advertising; however, I was mistaken. Although the installation was simple it only became a problem there after.  
First my unit kept having an E3 error message which apparently means my air conditioner is working so well that it has internal frost.  It then stops cooling the air and waits for itself to defrost. So every 5 minutes or so it would stop working even if the air temp was above 80 degrees.  
I didn't mind too much thinking the company would help since they vouch great costumer service. They have yet to call me back or respond via email.  If you call their costumer service hotline they MAKE you leave a message if they are too busy.  My three messages must have been misplaced.
All in all... BAD company and a bad expensive product.

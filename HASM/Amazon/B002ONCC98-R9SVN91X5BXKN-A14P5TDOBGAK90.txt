Title: Beware of HP 17" Laptops' Motherboard Issues
Content:
Bought mine a couple of years ago (for close to $[...]!!), and last month it stopped working.  I called the HP folks and they said i had just missed the 2 year warranty and would charge me ONLY $[...] to fix it!  It apparently was motherboard issue that had been posted on the internet, but HP failed to inform the owners about this FATAL issue, until it was too late.  Instead of recalling all of their defective 17" laptops, they just waited to see how many folks would actually discover this horror for themselves.  
Bottom Line:  HP products are the worst, and their support dept is even more twisted.  Just to save money and offer to fix it for free (since they knew long ago that the motherboard was defective), they asked me to pay $[...] bucks!! can you believe this.  I'll post these comments on other internet boards to let public aware of the HP tricks.  HP now stands for Hell to Pay!   They lost another customer and hopefully hundreds of others as well.   Good Luck, and I mean it!

Title: Mess or no mess
Content:
Love the coffee, but hate the mess. I have to echo so many of the comments of previous reviewers. The fill mechanism is located too far back and you wind up with dribbled coffee down the cup,and in some cases all over the counter. There is a tremendious amount of condensation with this machine. When the lid is lifted it runs every where. Hamilton Beach ought to recall this thing and send all owners something that is more efficient. Don't buy it!

Title: Best tasting coffee ever....
Content:
I have had the GT300 B&D for over 1 year now and it has worked perfectly. The cup of coffee tastes the same every time. It has a much better flavor than drip coffee makers, plus there is no more measuring and counting scoops! I use the Folgers brand as recommended. I did not care for the latte and expresso pods, but that's just me. Though I noticed my grocer stopped carrying the items. My only complaint is that I wish there was more of a choice for flavored coffees.

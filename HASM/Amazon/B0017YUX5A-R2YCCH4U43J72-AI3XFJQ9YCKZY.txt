Title: Hoover S3670 Decent Buy
Content:
I have had this vacuum for about a month now. I will say the suction is good as is the versatility. It seems to pull up a lot more pet hair than my previous vacuums. I like the fact you can pretty much take care of the whole house with the attachments and flexibilty of it being a cannister vacuum. I would say it's a good buy. My only issue with it is the build quality. The fact that there is a lot of plastic on the vacuum does concern me a bit but it has not been an issue as of yet.

Title: Poor customer service-Zojirushi
Content:
Received this coffee maker as a gift in Dec '08.  Carafe does not keep coffee hot for any length of time. Can feel warm spots on thermal carafe indicating poor qc on insulation.  Manfacturer admits faulty product and will send a new carafe, but I have to pay the $10.00 shipping fee. I objected to the $10.00 but this "customer unfriendly" company ignored my objection.
I will NEVER purchase ANYTHING from this company because they failed to fully backed their product. I recommend buying American or from any another company that believes in customer service!

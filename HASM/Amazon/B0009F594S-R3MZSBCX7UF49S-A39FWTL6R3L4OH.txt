Title: Arrived damaged
Content:
Have no idea how well the unit actually works - it arrived damage so I never plugged it in.  The cabinet broke away from the base of the unit during shipping.  This appears to be due partially to the design of the unit (this junction was weak) and packaging (being weak, it was even more important to support it for shipping.)  Given that the unit weighed about 90 lbs, it was not pleasant to pull it out of the packaging, only to have to re-package it to return it.  However, the return went smooth and my purchase credited promptly.  I ended up buying a Amcor Nanomax A12000EH instead, which works great.

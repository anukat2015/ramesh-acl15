Title: Looks nice, expensive and ineffective for us
Content:
We purchased this unit to use as supplementary heat in our basement.  We liked the "mount to the wall" option because the room in which we were hoping to use the unit is our children's playroom.  The heater has a nice appearance.  The smell diminished after one day.
Our experience:  This unit was no more effective than the $20 space heater we previously purchased from a local discount chain.  It only warms the area near the unit (about 5 ft),and it did not raise the overall temperature in the 450 sq foot room we were using it in.  The thermostat was a nice feature, and we thought that we could leave the unit on for a longer period of time because of that feature.  Our utility bill climbed by 20%!!  Needless to say we are not using the unit as planned,and we would have returned it if not for the high cost of shipping it back.  We now use it upstairs in our living area in the evenings near our main thermostat to hold the temperature in that room and prevent the main HVAC unit coming on.  It does fit nicely behind a chair when not in use, but not worth the price paid for us.  Bottom line-a purchase we regret and we are REALLY glad we tested it before we mounted it to the wall!!

Title: Good Coffee Maker - Works as advertised
Content:
I bought this coffee maker because of the BUNN name and because of the brewing time.  I've learned over the years that the faster you brew, the better the coffee.  BUNN clearly has the market on fast brewing.  I knew of BUNN from my restaurant days.  In that context, brewing a pot of coffee quickly is valuable, almost necessary.  While I don't have the same requirement at home, I believe coffee is better when brewed quickly.  
The non-heated carafe feature has worked fine for me.  I read many reviews complaining about leaking or dribbling when pouring from the carafe.  I have not experienced this, and suspect you just need to keep it clean.  Without the burner/heater, coffee does get colder faster. This is not a huge problem for me and I expected it.  
Overall this is a good coffee pot.  Buy it.

Title: Finally Found the one I like
Content:
I have been buying vacumns that cost no more than $100 for years. The last vacumn bagless Shock upright was the worst. I finally said you get what you pay for.
I looked over all the reviews on the Hoover before I purchased it. I just love it. What a big difference compared to the other vacumns I had through the years.  I cannot say enough about this Hoover. It is easy to assemble, light weight, retractable cord (that I love), the upholstery cleaner & other attachments pick as well.  This little thing really cleans the carpets & wood floors. The cup is easy to take out & put back after cleaning. Do not believe that cannister vacumns do not work well on carpets, that simply is not true at all. It picks up on carpets & makes them look like new.  It is just a great vacumn & so far so good.  Five stars to Hoover.

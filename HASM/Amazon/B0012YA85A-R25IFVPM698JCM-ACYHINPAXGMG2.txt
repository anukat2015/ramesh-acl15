Title: Survived the flood
Content:
I agree with all the positive things said and I probably can't offer much more than that.  I am extremely pleased with the quality of the images and the flexibility of the camera.
But I will say that, after I accidentally left the camera outside during a rainstorm for several hours, it worked fine the next day.  I was amazed.  I let it dry out and it worked perfectly.
Now, you probably won't buy this camera for that, but it is nice to know that it is a quality item.

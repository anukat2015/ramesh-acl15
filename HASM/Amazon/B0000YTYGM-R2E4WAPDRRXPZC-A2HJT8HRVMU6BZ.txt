Title: LET'S HAVE COFFEE!
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker a few days ago and have been completely satisfied and impressed by it's features and reliability. My old coffe makers made great coffee, but the glass carafes would stay heated and another cup of coffee an hour after the first cup would taste cooked and burnt. I would ultimately wind up throwing out the remaining coffee. I would have to make a cup at a time in order for it to taste fresh. Well, here is the solution! I make several cups of coffee for myself and colleagues or friends and hours after the first cups are served, the remaining coffee pours out hot and fresh, as if just brewed! I am totally thrilled by this machine and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves fresh tasting coffee throughout the day. It makes up to 12 cups and uses cone filters, #4 size. It is easy to clean and is programmable. When the brewing has finished, the coffee maker emits an audible beep and then shuts off, leaving the coffee hot and fresh for hours. You can also pour yourself a cup while it is brewing, thanks to the pause feature, which is always neat when you can't wait for that first cup. To help keep the coffee hot and fresh, it helps to rinse the carafe with hot water just before brewing. This coffee maker is fantastic!

Title: Great Camera
Content:
For the price I do not think I could have done better. I got this as a up grade from a 300D and man what a deal, The 20D is everything I expected and more. The EF-S 17-85 mm is a great lens for a walk around lens,and the IS I love you can get some tough shots with out a tripod. If you are looking to up grade and don't need all the bells and whistles of the 30D this could be what your looking for, same camera different price

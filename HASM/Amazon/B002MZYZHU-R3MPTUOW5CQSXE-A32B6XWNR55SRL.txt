Title: An upgrade to the Keurig system
Content:
This brewer is functionally the Platinum B70 Keurig brewer.  It accepts the standard K-cups and produces an exceptional single cup of coffee on demand.  The Keurig brewing system is easy to use, produces little mess while producing great cups of coffee.
This brewer includes the filter system and the reusable My K-Cup that must be purchased with the other systems.  The stainless steel exterior and slightly different design is the most visible difference.  Internally, this is a better-constructed brewer, less prone to problems with a higher customer rating than the B70 system.
Having used both, I find this system to make less noise with a sturdier feel.  Controls are about the same.  I feel the B70 is slightly easier to filling with water but not so much as to make this a buying decision.  If you make one or two cups of coffee a day, go with the B70.  If you make six to ten cups of coffee a day, I would consider this machine.

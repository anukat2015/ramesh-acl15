Title: Overpriced
Content:
I cannot get over how much Apple is asking for this device. I was looking at the Ipod and the RioRiot.  And it came down to this:  10 gig player: 500$  20 gig player: 300$ The size factor and apple chic factor is nice, but not worth 200 dollars more for half the storage.  As for transfer speed: how often are you going to be transferring a large number of files to it?  I loaded mine once and am set.  If you are willing to carry a portable that is a little larger you can save alot of money and carry twice as much music with you.

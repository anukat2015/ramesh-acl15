Title: Hoover WindTunnel S3765-040
Content:
Pros.: Very powerful, convenient to use, excellent performance on bare floors, carpet, upholstery, rugs, etc.
Cons.: Too rough brush bristles - very hard on packed rugs, for instance. Bottom plate of the brush roll assembly collects static electricity when used on rugs and/or carpet, thus accumulating light pet hair. Not too bad, though.
Conc.: Well worth the money. The closest match would be Miele vacuum cleaners if you believe in bagged cleaners in general and are willing to spend three times the money.

Title: check this out
Content:
The vacuum  was easy to assemble. I should have read entire manual first. the vacuum worked better than i hope for. If I could compare this vacuum to an auto it would be a luxury Buick for the cost of  a small car. now the pro's and con's. I found the other 5 star reviews to be accurate; on the positive abttribute's.  about the con's if you pull the cord all the way out you can vac three rooms; if you plug it in the middle room. the hose is long enough if the wand is telescoped out. the motor is so powerful if you use the carpet head you should run it on the lowest power setting, because the brush is turned by wind power and not a second motor. running it on setting two or three causes the brush to slow down and is harder to pull back. maybe thats what causes the belt problem's. i've read about.  The vacuum will pull over the cord if you lift up, just a little bit. as far as the dust bin, after it's empty, blow it out, with compressed air, it will be dry and look like new. as far as the other tool's they will stay on if you push them on . If they still won't stay on drill a small hole in the sleave for the button .I can think of two or three way's of carring them on board with you.  If i experence any probems
i'll write another review.

Title: A TISKET FOR THE BASKET
Content:
Makes good coffee, usual problems with glass carafe, but the big problem is the basket mechanism.  It gets stuck and the "brew" stays in overtime. This happened virtually right out of the box.
Braun advised us to order a replacement basket, pay the cost, fax them the bill for reimbursement.  Seems like a NEEDLESS hassle for the consumer.
When you order online, ya pays ur money and takes ur chances, eh?!

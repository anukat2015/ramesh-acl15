Title: Satisfied, but a little disappointed
Content:
I really enjoy this camera and I received it fairly quickly from Amazon, but I was a little disappointed to see that I was not the first one to open the box nor the first one to use the Lowepro camera strap that was free with purchase.  The products seem to be fine but very disappointed that the packaging for both items were already opened.  Also, I really enjoy the camera, but it was very discouraging and frustrating when I tried to shoot an inside event with my SB-80DX flash.  Although my flash is "compatible," it is not designed for digital cameras; so, I have to go buy another $400-500 flash - just another way for the camera industry to stick it to you.

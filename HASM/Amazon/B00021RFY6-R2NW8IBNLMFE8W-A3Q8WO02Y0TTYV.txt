Title: A great coffeemaker
Content:
Based on using the grind & brew at my old roomie's whenever i go to visit her and her husband in new jersey, after vowing that i don't  need to spend the money for a cuisinart when mr coffee does a fine job, i am looking to get a grind & brew for myself. 
at first i thought it was far too complex.  after just a few visits, where i happily sat back and let liz set up the coffee pot for the next morning while i watched, i attempted it myself.  no messes, no problems, just a pot of coffee ready when we were.  well, the only problem we had is one mentioned by another reviewer, running out and having to make another pot.
we fill to the max with coffee beans, but do not use the full amount of water, so i guess the comment about the fineness of the grind is probably true.  and there are a few removable parts to be cleaned, but it's not much trouble at all.  i roast my own coffee, then grind and brew.  i think the trade0-off of having a couple of parts to clean will be balanced by the few seconds i'll save by not having to grind it myself every time.

Title: Great little notebook!!!
Content:
I got this last month and it is great! I had to turn off the HP system care as it was slowing down the computer, but now it is fine. This little baby has already log over 20,000 miles. The 14.1 size allowed it to fit into 5 of 6 hotel room safes were I stayed. If you travel, 14.1 widescreen is the biggest laptop that will fit into hotel room safes. My first HP (third laptop) and I love it!

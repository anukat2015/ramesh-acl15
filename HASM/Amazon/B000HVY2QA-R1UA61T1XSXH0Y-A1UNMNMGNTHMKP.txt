Title: Very Quiet,Heats a Bedroom great, but themostat could be better
Content:
This heater is super quiet, which is nice. I have a 12 by 12 bedroom and this heater kept it warm even when the temp outside got down into the teens.  The only problem that I have had with this heater is the thermostat.  The thermostat works ok when you are in low or high mode.  The problem occurs in economy mode, what happens here is that the heater will run on high if the temp is more than three degrees from the set point, then when it gets to less than 3 degrees the heater runs on low then.  But the problem is that the heater will not cut off when the correct temp is reached, it will just keep heating.  Other than that this is a pretty good heater.
Update 2-6-09  Just after Christmas the thermostat stopped working completely.  The heater would just run all of the time.  I called customer service January 2 but had to leave a voice mail. I Figured that they was closed for the holiday and they would return my call next week. I never received a call so I called them several more times with no luck.  Well finally on 2-4-09 they called and said that they had just now got to me on the list.  I told them the problem and they said if I would mail the heaters cord to them with 12.00 to cover shipping that they would send out a new heater next week.  This would be one of the best space heaters I have ever owned if the quality was just better.  We will see how well heater number 2 lasts.

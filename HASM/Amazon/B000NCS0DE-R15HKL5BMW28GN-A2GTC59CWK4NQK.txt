Title: Thrilled with HV9010P Pet hair pickup
Content:
The Black&Decker Black & Decker HV9010P Retriever Pet-Series Cyclonic-Action Corded Dustbuster and Blower Pet-Series Dustbuster works terrific on pet hair in the dog beds. It is lightweight but sturdy, right power for hair, filter easy to access and empty, plenty long cord, and it picks up hair with one pass.Noisy enough to scare the dogs.   
It sells on Amazon for about $30 &I get no commission.  :-)

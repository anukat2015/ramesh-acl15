Title: Mr. Coffee ECMP50 & I ... BFF (or as long as you last...)
Content:
The reviews are right. Mr. Coffee has come through with the ECMP50! This very affordable machine makes an eye-opening cup of espresso. Other reviewers have summed up the product quite well, I just wanted to chime in with my support. As far as taking advantage of this appliance, read the advice of the other reviewers (especially K. Kreuger). Also read the instructions. They are short, simple and important. I haven't had a problem with leaking yet, and the tamp is flimsy as reported. Get rid of the black rubber tip on the frothing wand, and the single demitasse is too small to be practical. Other than that this unit is a beauty, and the espresso is de-lish! I am super pleased with my purchase.

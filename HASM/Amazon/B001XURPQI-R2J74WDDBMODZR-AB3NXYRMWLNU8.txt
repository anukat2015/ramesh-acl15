Title: Awesome buy! Love it!
Content:
I bought the 500D recently and I'm really happy with the pictures. Having been bit by the photography bug not too long ago, the T1i turned out to be a great buy as the features are real easy to use. The menu is very user friendly and the LCD screen size and sharpness are amazing. I've used the D5000 and prefer the 500D over it.

Title: I'm more than pleased!
Content:
I bought an Electrolux 2 in 1 vacuum online because the reviews promised it was an excellent product; however, the reality was another. I spent $ 100 on a useless vacuum so I was skeptical buying another vacuum online, but I bumped into a Consumer's Website which has a lot of expert/non-bias reviews about different products and of course the Electrolux was rated an "F" so I knew this Site was to be trusted. I bumped into the Dirt Devil 082700 Vision Turbo Canister Vacuum and I liked it because it was light and easy to use, plus the reviews were excellent. Well, I have had it for over 2 months now and I'm pleased to say that it is exactly what the reviews promised and more. I'm a very camper. I recommend it 101%.

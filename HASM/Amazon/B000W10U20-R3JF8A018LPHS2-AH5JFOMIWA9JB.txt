Title: Looks nice.  Terrible Terrible service
Content:
I started having scrambled video and lockups with this machine after 3 months.  WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GET MAIL IN SERVICE WITH THIS MACHINE.  They sent it back the first time still broken and locking up.  Now they keep delaying the return to me telling me that the part is on backorder.  I have been without my laptop now for 1.5 months...Good thing I kept my old computer around as a back up.
This has been a complete nightmare.  Whenever I call they transfer me between 4 different people and I have yet to hear from the case manager.  This will be my last HP computer.

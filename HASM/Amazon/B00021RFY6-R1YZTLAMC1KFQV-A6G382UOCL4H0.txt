Title: Glad I went ahead and bought it!
Content:
I waffled (note my tag line - I research until I get decision paralysis!)... and this didn't have great reviews.  BUT... the refurb price was great, and the usefulness of the grind and brew is perfect. It WAS the right choice.  (I was grinding my beans every morning... and most recently, also doing a "heat the water to 193 degrees on the stove and pour-over"  system while I "Decided" which coffee maker to buy).  Frankly, I'm saving up for a good espresso machine, so I didn't want to buy a top-of-the-line coffee maker in the interim... but I did need one that kept the coffee warm, not baked,and was easy to use.
I'll note here that my DH is VERY handy, and he figured out how to snap all the parts together (yes, they do have to latch and click firmly into place) to keep from getting drips and overflow.  But once I "got" it, I have had NO problems.  The timer goes off, the grind starts, the coffee brews... and by the time I get downstairs in the morning, I am greeted with the best coffee I've had at home.  (and I had a Melitta, a Krups, a Braun, and a Bunn over my many years of drinking...).  I'm satisfied. There are flaws - the carafe doesn't actually empty completely but that's the tradeoff for the way it retains the heat for at least two hours (all the longer 10 cups last me!).
You have to read the directions, and you have to recognize that it does require compliance with the "click it-fit it or it overflows" rules.  BUT well worth it!  (And, I CAN set it up the night before and it does NOT leak - which my Melitta and Braun both did!).

Title: Don't Do It!
Content:
I bought two of these for Xmas for my kids.  One is still working, the other froze up at the start up screen.  Even the computer couldn't find it when plugged to the USB port.  So, thankfully Amazon sent me a new one.  It worked for 3 hours and right back to the same problem.  Phone customer support from Sansa walked me through trouble shooting.  End result. . .nothing.  They were unable to get it going.  Their suggestion was to return it, and I did!  Thank you Amazon for being so easy to work with.  Amazon gets 5 stars, Sansa player 0!

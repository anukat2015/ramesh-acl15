Title: Not So Happy
Content:
I purchased 2 of these units to add additional heat to my bedroom and family rooms.  My first disappointment was the 18 inch cord.  It is impossible to place the unit anywhere without it backing up against something.  The manual warns against using extensions or power strips and it also requires its own individual outlet (nothing else is suppose to be plugged in the same outlet which normally contains 2 plug ins).  I have it set at 75degrees and so far, it has come on twice for about 5 seconds and turns right off.  I'm so dissappointed as I can only return it for another model or pay a 15percent restocking fee... and like an idiot, I bought 2 of them.

Title: Great Camera
Content:
I bought this to replace my older Canon Digital Rebel, 6.2MP. What an improvement. Best 10MP camera in the market. Their Sensor Cleaning and Image Stabilizer are the best on a DSLR. These features along with the better price than both Canon and Nikon make this a great choice. From professional reviews this camera with it lens kit has the best lens vs the competition. Canon on their stock lens kit uses very low end lens. The 4:3 system also makes the 40-150mm lens work at twice the mm or 80-300mm. This results in the lens being much smaller than the competition, so you are more likely to take the larger lens with you on trips.

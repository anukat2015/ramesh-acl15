Title: Not as good as it looks
Content:
This was a great vacuum for the first month.  It is true that the spinning brush helps pick up dirt.  But what they don't tell you is that after a few uses it is virtually impossible to remove the dirt that gets embedded in the brush which hampers its use.  It is very noisy so you'll need a pair of ear plugs.  Also, the only way to do corners is to remove the motorized sweeper portion.  This requires removing a plug that is an awkward place. Wear gloves when you do this or you will draw blood from your nuckles as I've done. The attachments are useless so you will need to use the hose without any attachments to get into corners and baseboards.   The motorized sweeper doesn't work on bare floors.  You can turn off the motor but it doesn't pick up much. When the motor is on, I end up chasing dust across the floor.  The dust always wins. I have to use the hose without any attachments on the floor.  A real back breaker. Also, you want to be very careful when emptying the canister.  Dust will fly everywhere because not everything is trapped in the compartment.  Needless to say, I'm looking for a new vacuum cleaner.

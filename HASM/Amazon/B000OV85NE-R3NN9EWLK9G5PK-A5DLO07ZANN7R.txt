Title: Bad Design
Content:
I agree with some of the other reviewers. This is a great idea and a TERRIBLE design! Every single time you twist the bottom to change the song, the bottom cap falls off. I just bought this for my 4-year old son and I'm taking it back tomorrow and shopping for a different brand.

Title: does not cool
Content:
It is extremely noisey even on the low setting, but worse is that it does not even cool.  IT didn't seem to cool at all so I let it run all night in an attempt to cool down a small room, the next morning the room was 1 degree cooler than the other rooms.  A fan would do similar work and have less noise and cost.

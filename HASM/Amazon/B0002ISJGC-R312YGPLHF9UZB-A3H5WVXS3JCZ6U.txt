Title: Not even worth the cheap price
Content:
I bought this model looking for an inexpensive, programmable model, after my Braun combo machine died out.  The good news is that the programmable feature is easy to use and works well.  Other than that, however, this machine is a major drag.  The lid to the carafe is supposed to be removable, but the first time I took it off, the plastic nibs that fit into the guide holes snapped right off, so its never fit back together properly since.  That's particularly annoying, because it makes the dripless pour into a constant drip.  Also, the caraffe lid is what interacts with the bottom of the brew mechanism, so now I have to really force it just right or the coffee goes everywhere.
Even if I hadn't broken the lid, the filiter basked has to be inserted just right, again with the help of two tiny plastic nibs that are sure to break next.  If you don't turn it just right, you don't realize it until coffee is everywhere.  That's because it looks like it is in properly, but if you close the lid, and then insert the carafe, you don't realize that the carafe has in fact pushed the basked up and out of place.  If you don't do everything in the right order, you've got a problem.  Is this easy to realize and adapt to?  Sure, but its an annoying design flaw regardless.
And finally, in all the coffee makers I'ev had, I've never had one that leaves so much condensation on the top of the reservoir lid.  Overall, this has been a major disappointment.

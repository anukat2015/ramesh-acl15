Title: What A Waste of My TIme and Money
Content:
I had this item shipped from Compactappliance.  I set it up and it did not work properly, meaning there was no cold air.  It was 90+ degrees and I think the condensor kicked in once for a few seconds, sputtered, and kicked off.  I went to Home Depot locally and bought a better product at a better price and it was easier to set up.  I did not have to pay extra for a pricey window extension either.  It was so difficult dealing with the company that sold it to me.  They referred me to customer service of the manufacturer, which appears to be in the same town as the shipper, and I got nowhere because it was next to impossible to even get a call in to them.  Endless emails.  I finally bucked up and shipped the darn thing back to them at MY expense (around $50.00).  Yeah, they said they would look at it, and they did refund my money and gave a credit for a different problem, but then claimed they just put it back in stock, ignoring the fact it did not work.  I would hate for you to receive what I did and have to pay to ship it back when it does not work and not have a/c when you need it.  So, I lost money buying this non-functioning thing.  This has got to be the worst nightmare in years.  I regularly order things from amazon and by mail and rarely have any problems.

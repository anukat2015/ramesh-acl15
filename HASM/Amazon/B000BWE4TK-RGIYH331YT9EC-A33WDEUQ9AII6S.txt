Title: Great Camera
Content:
Wow is the word!!  Up until I purchased this camera I have always had point and shoot cameras.  I wanted something more and this delivers.  You should know that once you have this in your hands you will find yourself wanting to purchase additional lenses and accessories to compliment this model.  This is not a problem just understand once you convert to SLR it becomes addicting!!  I have purchased and additional $700 worth of lenses and accessories.  I love the way this camera feels in my hands and even more than that the ease of use.  The image quality is phenomenal and the speed is outstanding.  I plan on picking up the D40x later this year but for now I intend on enjoying this remarkable camera. I can't say enough good things about it.  Buy this camera, you will love it!!

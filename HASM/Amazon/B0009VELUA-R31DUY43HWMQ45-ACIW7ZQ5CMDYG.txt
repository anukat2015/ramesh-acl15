Title: Wet countertop isn't necessarily from a leak
Content:
I also thought my 2000 leaked, but after paying attention to it, I noticed it is the result of the condensation on the lid.  When you open the lid after use, you should notice it is wet.  Although there is a trough that is designed to catch the water, it generally fails to do so unless the lid is opened quickly and all the way and even then some drops make their way down the back.  This isn't to say that no unit has ever leaked, but after talking to two people I know with the same unit, they discovered their "leak" was a result of the same thing.

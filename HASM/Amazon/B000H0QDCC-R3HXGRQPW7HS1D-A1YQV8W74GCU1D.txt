Title: Buy Creative Not Zune
Content:
At Christmas time, I was able to buy two Zune's at a great price.  I have been using a Creative Vision M for years and love that player but, at the price, I thought a Zune would be a nice backup so I bought my son and myself each a Zune.  
After spending hours trying to install the Zune software on my sons pc, I finally gave up.  I was able to get the software to install on another pc but that install also took a long time.  Check the internet, there are many people not able to install the Zune software.  After installing the software, the best that I can say is that it does not work well.  Getting songs to be added correctly requires editing all the MP3 tags.  Adding videos is extremely slow and the process to convert a video so that is can be added to the player is time consuming. Adding songs and videos requires several additional software.
The Zune interface is not great either.  I would like the ability to remove items on the menu that I will never use but that option is not available.  Navigation is fair but playing media requires several clicks. 
The best that I can say about the two Zunes that I have purchased is that at least I did not spend very much money.

Title: Great alternative to 2GB iPod Nano
Content:
This is a great and cheaper alternative to the 2GB iPod Nano. I like the fact that it is expandable using Micro SD cards and has voice recording capabilities.  The unit is also easy to use, I figured out most of the functions in an hour (hint: get familiar with the menu options and visit Sandisk's site for some videos on using this unit).  The unit's functions are accessable with one hand after you are familiar with them.  Tip: To turn off the Sansa, press MENU once and then press and hold MENU for 2 seconds
You can use the supplied software to put your music on it but I found using Windows Media Player 11 is the easiest way to do so.  I have not used Rhapsody to buy and upload any music to my Sansa yet.
Sound quality is excellant using the supplied earbuds, I had slightly mixed results with the sound quality using my car's cassette deck (the songs ripped at higher bit rates sounded better).
I am hoping that Sandisk (and others) develope a more complete set of accessories for this unit like a docking unit and a case.

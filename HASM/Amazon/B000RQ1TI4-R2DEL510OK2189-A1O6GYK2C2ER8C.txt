Title: IF IT LEAKS, TIP IT FORWARD
Content:
ok, i just want to say that i own this AC unit, and it's alright. it's nothing exceptional, and i probably would never buy it again.
i live in boston, and it gets ridiculously humid. it started leaking, but then my bf and i tipped it forward and the leaking stopped. 
good luck.

Title: Powerful, but not (as durable as) your mother's vacuum.
Content:
UPDATE: WOULD REDUCE TO 2 STARS. At no charge, the manufacturer sent a replacement cover to correct the broken rivet. The customer service was good. They suggested bending the wheel into place to straighten the Now, however, 17 months after purchase, the electric power nozzle does not turn on. This follows on several weeks of the nozzle turning on and off intermittently. Now I wish I had purchased the vacuum from a physical store with a buyer protection program. My new strategy is to buy cheap vacuums on a buyer protection plan and get the broken parts replaced. This was way too expensive for the grief.
ORIGINAL: I bought this because I was tired of the expensive, plastic vacuums falling apart within the first year of use. While this vacuum is incredibly powerful (indeed it sucks the area rugs right off the floor) it's not the indestructible stainless steel canister vacuum of my childhood. Within the first 4 months a rivet broke loose from the canister, making it impossible to close the vacuum. I tape it shut for use now. One wheel drags as well, leaving long black scuff marks on my white floors. I'm underwhelmed, but perhaps the manufacturer will make good on the warranty.

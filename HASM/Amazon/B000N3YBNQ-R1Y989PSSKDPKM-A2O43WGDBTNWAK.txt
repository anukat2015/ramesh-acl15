Title: Don't Go Under The Bed
Content:
Electrolux EL5020A Intensity Upright Vacuum Cleaner
Yeah, that's right, this vacuum may have good suction, but if you were thinking it'd fit under a bed to gather up those dustbunnies, just because the handle will flatten down to the floor, YOU WERE WRONG.  The unit's main vacuumhead sits too tall to allow it passage under anything but the tallest of beds.  I mean, the carry handle's nice and all, but it also raises its profile too much to be of much use universally.  Got it for a good price though, woo-hoo!  Dumb.

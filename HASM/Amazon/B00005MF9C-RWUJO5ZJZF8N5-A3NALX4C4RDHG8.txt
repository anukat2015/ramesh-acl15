Title: Works for me!
Content:
This little Black and Decker unit is ideal for my needs.  It has met all my expectations and delivers just the right amount of coffee in time, on time.  I like the permanent filter and the ability to add my own grinds.  I don't think I'd enjoy the "pods" that many one cup coffemakers rely on.  It's fairly easy to clean and the insulated cup keeps the 15 ounces hot as long as 15 ounces needs to be "babied".  The unit takes up minimal counter space.  If you're a confirmed coffee addict, then you're probably going to want a racing model maker.  For the person that "wants" instead of "needs", then this unit is for you.  For the price, about the equivalent of 9 cups from one of the "designer" coffee boutiques, you've paid for the unit! Gitchaself one!

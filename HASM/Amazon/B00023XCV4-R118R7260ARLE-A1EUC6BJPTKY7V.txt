We have been using this brand percolator for thirty plus years. They have replaced a poor power cord connection with one that really works well.
All of our friends and guests are overwhelmed by the quality of coffee this percolator makes. Most use the drip type and complain of weak,not hot coffee.
We bought this one to have when the present one "dies". Could be years, but,we wanted good coffee with no interuption !

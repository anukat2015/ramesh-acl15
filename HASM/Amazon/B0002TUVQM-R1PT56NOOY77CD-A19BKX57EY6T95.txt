Title: FUN Winter-weather Appliance
Content:
After reading the various reviews for this brand of hot chocolate machine I bought the Grande (60 oz) machine for a special winter event my company was hosting. What a great decision! First snowfall of the year, customers were streaming in & met with a Perfect Temperature cup of hot chocolate!  Perfectly mixes cold milk & powder hot chocolate, fun frothing feature, and truly reheats mixture to the perfect temperature as needed - without supervision.  After making two big batches and 3 hours of operation, cleaning the heating plate of baked-on chocolate took a few minutes with a Dobie - a small price to pay.
I'd bought a snazzier model by a different maker in the smaller size for home use (at twice the cost of the big one).  We really missed the dispenser tap and automatic reheat features of the Back to Basics brand. After only one use, we ditched that one and bought this one. We're pleased to say this little guy is perfect for countertop use & comes with all the features of the Grande.

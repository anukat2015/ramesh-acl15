Title: Simple, but not toasty
Content:
Excellent product. Simple to put on a wall, simple to plug in and use, extremely efficient. Switch it on and (more or less) forget it - overnight, during the day whatever. Its hot to the touch but unless you're extremely unlucky you're unlikely to burn yourself touching the surface by accident.
My only complaint is that in an exterior-facing room in a cold environment (new england/boston) its heat output isnt sufficient to cope with the 20F-type temperatures. Our ground floor room is slightly less cold now thanks to this heater, but I wouldnt say its "toasty".

Title: One of my best possessions
Content:
I've had the Rebel XTi for about 2 months now and I'm glad I made that switch from a point-and-shoot digital camera. You cannot go wrong with this one, a good balance between price and quality of output. Anything I say will be redundant since the ratings on this camera speaks for itself. I'm already lusting for lenses and I'm sure a lot of you are. Yes, the lenses do get a bit expensive but a good picture is worth spending the money.
I did have some trouble with the viewfinder on the camera I received but thanks to Amazon's great customer service, the replacement was at my door in 2 days!

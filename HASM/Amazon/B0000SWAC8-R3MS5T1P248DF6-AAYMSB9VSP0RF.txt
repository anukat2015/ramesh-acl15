Title: Terrible Vacuum
Content:
This vacuum is shoddily made from cheap plastic.  After only two months with it (using it only once a week) it is already being duct-taped.  The extender is connected to the handle with a flimsy little piece of plastic, meaning that it disconnects during the push and pull of normal vacuuming.  Air rushes around the buttons on the handle, which means that the hose is not sealed off, while the powerful carpet attachment spews debris back at your feet.
  While there is no such thing as an ergonomically correct vacuum, this is one of the worst.  The canister rolls fine on hardwood and tile floors, but is too heavy and ponderous for carpet or rugs (no matter how thin).  The unit does not turn well and then lags behind you, meaning that it gets jerked along as you vacuum (not a unit for apartments or smaller spaces) running into your legs, scarring furniture, and knocking things over.  The rolly-polly design of the canister unit causes it to tip over quite often, while the carpet attachment is FAR too heavy and bulky to be of any use--and the 'power control' mechanism drags you across the floor.  This leaves only the lighter, brush attachments, which means that the vacuum picks up NOTHING.  Lastly, the power cord retracts itself while you vacuum--without you pushing the retract button--meaning that the plug gets jerked out of the wall every five feet.  
  And I have just learned that this is NOT an American Electrolux.  Instead, it is manufactured by a foreign company with no customer service to speak of.  I strongly recommend that customers AVOID this product.

Title: Terrible for pet hair!
Content:
After my Shark canister vac finally bit the dust, this was the only canister vac I could find after going to several stores.  That was the main reason I bought it.  We have four short hair dogs, two of which shed quite a bit. I have used this vacuum about a dozen times now and if the floor has more than a day or two worth of hair buildup, the hair just collects on the brush, it doesn't suck up into the vacuum.  The first time it happened, I couldn't figure out why all of a sudden the vacuum wasn't picking anything up.  So I turned the suction head upside down and found it completely clogged with dog hair.  I ended up pulling out about a softball sized wad of hair out of the head by the time I was done.  My Shark never had a problem picking up the hair or with clogging so I know it's not just that we have too much hair (too many dogs, yes - but a reasonable amount of hair for a vacuum to handle).  I also have the Roomba IRobot and it handles our floors without missing a beat.  This Dirt Devil is a giant waste of money.  You might as well just open your doors and hope that the hair blows outside.  Our whole house is hardwood or tile so I can't comment on how this would perform on carpet.
Edited to add:  Just about a week after I posted this review, the "power nozzle" motor no longer works.  Beyond actually bringing in new dirt and dumping it on my floor, I'm not sure how this product could get any worse.

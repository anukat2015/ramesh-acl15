Title: I like it
Content:
Got this coffeemaker to replace a similarly-priced Braun. I like this unit becuase it has a plastic lip on the carafe that keeps it from spilling when it is full. The Braun just had a small lip molded into the glass and it was nearly impossible to pour the first cup without spilling. This B&D unit also makes quite a bit more coffee, which can be convenient. It keeps the coffee hot enough, but just barely for my tastes. I felt the Braun sometimes did not keep the coffee hot enough.

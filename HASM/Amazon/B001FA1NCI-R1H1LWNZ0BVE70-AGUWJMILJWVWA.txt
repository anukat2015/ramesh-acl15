Title: ok but could be better
Content:
Purchased the Nano 4g to replace my Nano 2g.  Overall, I like it but it could be better.
Pro's:
  Nice bigger / brighter display (compared to 2g)
  Cover flow is nice
  Accelerometer is cool for games
Con's
  Battery life not as good as 2g (probably because of the larger display)
  Scroll wheel not as accurate or responsive as 2g scroll wheel (wheel feels like it is made out of flimsy material). 
  Must disconnect ear buds before connecting/disconnecting dock connector cable because of space constraints.  
  On Windows Vista, ITunes runs like a frozen t**d.  The folks at Apple recommend you migrate to a Mac to overcome this hurdle.

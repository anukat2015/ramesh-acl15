Title: Looks Aren't Everything
Content:
One day I'll read specs more carefully. I've had coffee pots with the gold filters before, but none that couldn't be replaced with paper which are much more convenient. Still, I used this Cuisinart which, admittedly, we bought because it went with the stainless/black appliances in our kitchen.
Coffee was good, and 12 cups is better than 10, but it didn't really do any more than our Krups and it is BIG almost to clunky. For those who said that it doesn't make a strong cup of coffee, I can't be the judge: it's a matter of taste. As for those who said that the coffee didn't taste good, that may well be the brand of coffee you use. I find Starbucks to be bitter and overcooked, and Yuban at half the price, to be perfect. As I said, a matter of taste.
So it comes down to the basket, and that's a bigger pain than paper. I remember that this was $150 when it first came out. Well, you can get it through Amazon at 5 bucks less than Macy's final - absolute final - Christmas sale price and without shipping.

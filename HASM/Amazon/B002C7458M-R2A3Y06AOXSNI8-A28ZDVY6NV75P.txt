Title: Glad I bought it
Content:
My seven year old PC was starting to have a life of it's own and I knew it was time to buy a new computer and a Laptop this time.  I just could not face dealing with MS operating systems again.  I took the plunge and spent the big $$ it takes to get a MacBook Pro.  Apple had a one day sale $100 off, no shipping fee and no interest for a year I could not resist.
I am so glad I did.  After one day of going through the learning curve and pulling out what's left of my hair, life changed.  It is such a pleasure to use.  So nice not to have crapware and trialware to deal with and much more straightforward when dealing with installing/uninstalling software.   
At the same time I was purchasing this a friend was going to also but at the last minute could not resist the cheap pricing on PC Laptops currently available.  Well its about a month later now and his network has failed, some of the programs don't run, and a PC specialist is coming out to fix and reconfigure his system at quite a chunk of money per hour.     Macs are expensive and time will tell about reliability but I am very happy so far and feel it's money well spent.

Title: Great Bagless Vacuum!!!
Content:
This is a great vacuum. I use it to clean my tile floors and to clean the car out. This compact vacuum has incredibale suction power! I also like the bagless featurs so that i can actually see what i am picking up, and bags are a pain any way. The reason that i gave it four stars is because the cord could be a littlt bit longer and also i lost the blue head for cleaning carpet so i do not know how it does at cleaning carpet. Oh and is also a great price!

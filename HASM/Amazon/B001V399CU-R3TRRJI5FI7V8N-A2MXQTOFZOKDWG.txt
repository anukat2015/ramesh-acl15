Title: Good for the Money!
Content:
Took me a minute to set up because the instructions were sparse. If I was not computer savvy, it would have been a challenge! Good sound quality, pricing and product -- I am pleased with this purchase. Previously I was using my iPod on my iPhone in the gym and did not feel comfortable toting that around there or when I was jogging on the street. Very happy with this purchase!!!

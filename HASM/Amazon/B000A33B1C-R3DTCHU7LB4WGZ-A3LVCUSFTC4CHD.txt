Title: So far so good
Content:
So far this has been a good unit.  I use it to keep my plumbing in my RV from freezing in the winter.  I have left my RV unattended with this set to "Anti Freeze" for about a month now and all is well.  It hasn't burned the place down yet.  We'll see what next season holds.

Title: A thing of beauty... for those who can use it.
Content:
The MacBook Air is an amazing piece of technology to be sure. It can do most everything that it's big brothers, MacBook and MacBook Pro, can do. All in a thin, three pound package.
But this machine is not for everybody. It's for someone who already has Mac tech somewhere else in their life and want a pricey, portable addition to that tech.
If you're using this at home and the office, you'll need at least one Airport Extreme to get your WiFi going. You'll also need to have a sharable Mac, or an external hard drive or external SuperDrive. One of your WiFi devices should probably be the new Time Capsule so you can quickly back-up the system since 80gb probably won't last long these days.
Apple usually stays a step or two ahead of the industry. This time, they may have taken a giant step too far.

Title: The silent, efficient, mean grean sucking machine!
Content:
I LOVE my new vac! It does the job, doesn't make my head hurt with the noise, keeps all the dust to itself, and even makes my dated carpeting look like new. Love the carrying handle, and that all of the pieces click - and hold. With the one this one replaced, the pieces were coming off all the time. 
The only complaint I have is that the poor thing topples over in tight turns. But I'm sure I can learn to maneuver it more gently, we'll be blissfully happy together. 
(Geez, I sound like a fifties housewife, but the vacuum really made my life a lot better!)

Title: Satisfied so far
Content:
I've had one of these for a couple of months and so far, so good.  It is loud but tolerable.  I think the bags are easy to change -- as with most vacuums, I recommend not waiting until a bag is overfull or things get messy. The long hose is good for reaching under things but makes it a bit of a pain to store.  I think the plastic it is made of is a bit cheap and I wonder if it will hold up over time.  I didn't want to spend a lot though and think it's a good product for the price.

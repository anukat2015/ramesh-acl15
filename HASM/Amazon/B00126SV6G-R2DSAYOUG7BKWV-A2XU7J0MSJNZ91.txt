Title: First Impressions
Content:
This Creative Zen 16 GB is all I hoped for.  I have no yet succeeded in using the bookmarks to stop and start different media.  I am mostly using books I have downloaded and I can get them to start again by pushing the stop button and then shutting the player down.  When I start the player again I can push the stop button again and my story continues.  The problem with that is that if I play music I have lost my place in the book.  The instructions haven't help me solve this problem.  
I have not successfully transferred all the music I want to.  Some transfers and some does not.  It's trial and error I guess.  
Technically I think the player is excellent.  It's the operator who isn't too good.

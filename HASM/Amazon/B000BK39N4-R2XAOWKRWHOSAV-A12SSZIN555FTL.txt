Title: Good quality, good grip, good battery
Content:
I like most everything about this camera. There is one caveat to this and that is the noise levels above 400 are really too much. I generally don't shoot that high and I always use raw. I would suspect that the noise filter would work pretty good on the JPG images, but I don't know (as it does on the Canons). The focusing is not as fast as the comparable Canon or Nikon, but the colors and the spot meterings are better and it has the advantage of the self-cleaning sensor. This is really what pushed me over and I have not been disappointed except with stated above. I'm still giving it 5 because I have used the camera and the picture quality and feel is really good.

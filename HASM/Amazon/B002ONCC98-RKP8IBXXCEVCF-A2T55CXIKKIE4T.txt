Title: KB's Review
Content:
I purchased this laptop from Amazon. This is quite a machine. It is incredibly fast. Effortless set-up also. All I did was literally turn it on followed the prompts and it was done. Even my wireless card was effortless. The large screen is perfect for on-line games. The battery life is about 3 hours on mine. The only drawbacks I have encountered is not having any slots in the back for usb ports. It would be nice to have a power cord slot in the back as well. I Love this laptop. It is by far the best computer I have ever owned. Buy one and find out.

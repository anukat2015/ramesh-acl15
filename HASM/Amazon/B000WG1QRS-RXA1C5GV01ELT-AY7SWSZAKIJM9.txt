Title: Great player, couldn't be happier.
Content:
I got this player for my wife this Christmas just to try something different than the Ipod Nano I own. I was expecting to be pleased with the player but after using it I am very impressed. The player works great and is very easy to use. What I am most happy about is the use of the Zune marketplace with the Zune. The marketplace is very graphical and intuitive. This complete package makes me recommend this player to anyone looking to get their first mp3 player or someone who is looking to try a new brand.

Title: This was my first camera
Content:
Unfortunately someone swiped it, but I learned how to shoot digital photos on this model.  I loved it and used it every day until it was stolen.  I'll probably upgrade for my next camera, but for the price this is an excellent model for anything you'd need to do.  If you're a pro then you already know what you need, but if you're getting into photography and am not sure what your first camera should be, you won't be disappointed by this one.  The only thing that could be better is the autofocus in low light conditions, but if you are not into using manual focus then you may as well just get a nice powershot that will fit in your pocket.

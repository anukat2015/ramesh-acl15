Title: A gaming computer for cheap!
Content:
This computer will run all the games you want. It runs Fallout 3 consistently at 40fps avg average max settings. Make sure all apps are closed though and you don't have virus checking running.
I wouldn't run too many apps at once like you can do with an Intel I3 or quad core but the computer doesn't slow too much if you forget to close a few apps. With Windows 7 Premium (WMC)and the remote it's also a speedy multimedia machine.  The Radeon 4650 works superb with the 4GB DDr3 ram and 1 gig dedicated (it's needed with all the shaders it can handle) and 1066FSB. Run's a little hot while gaming but not if you raise the computer up.
If you want to stay cutting edge without breaking the bank or brag about the price you paid while zipping through your favorite games at high settings this is it. I would also get a 12 cell battery and turn off the power saver settings for when the plug is out so you don't loose speed.

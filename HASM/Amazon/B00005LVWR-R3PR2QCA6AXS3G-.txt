Title: I had 12 of them, so far, three were dead.
Content:
I am in coffee business. Last month, I ordered 12 saeco cafe cremawhich is the same of Vienna Deluxe. I found several machinehad the problem on case installation, the problem wasthey didn't insert the inner board correctly, so the lefttop case did not fit to the lower case. That's easy to fix.But now three of them could not be turned on. I checked mostparts inside, looked OK. The only problem could be the controlboard behide the control pannel. I have not decided to contactSaeco or not, since it takes three months to get parts.It's a good espresso machine, but make sure you need toget easy access to the service center before you buying it.

Title: The heater works perfectly!
Content:
I bought this heater at Wal-Mart for $40.00 so Amazon's price is higher plus it doesn't include taxes and shipping.  The unit itself is wonderful.  I have a 15x14 bedroom and it gets my room up to 80 degrees in no time.  It's not extremely quiet but it's not so loud that it drowns out the TV.  I love the fact you can tell what temperature it is in the room right on the heater and that it swivels back and forth on it's own.  The feature that was most important to me is that the front face/grill of it wouldn't be hot to the touch and no matter what the temperature it stays cool.  So I don't have to worry about anyone getting burned or it tipping over on something and burning the house down.
I bought another heater (smaller) for my office cubicle and that one's going back because it throws heat but only in one direction and the front/grill gets hot.  For it to be effective it would have to sit on my desk and that's not possible.  So, I'll just pick-up another Honeywell.  I highly recommend this Honeywell heater, I haven't had to turn on the heat so far and with these units I hopefully won't have to all winter long.

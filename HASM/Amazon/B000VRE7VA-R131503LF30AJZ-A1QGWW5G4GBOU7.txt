Title: Looking for a high quality DSLR
Content:
Even though this is not the absolute top of the line, it is certainly worthy of high praise.  I am not a professional photographer, but I do take high level (raw) shots, edit them on photoshop and post to websites and make brochures and business cards from my photos.  This camera pretty much does all I ask.  The biggest selling point was that the anti-shake feature is built into the camera and not the lens.  I would recommend this camera to just about anyone.  Down side is that it doesn't have wide format.  That is a couple of thousand more that I didn't have.

Title: I love my player
Content:
I got my Zen about 6 months ago and I have only had one problem with it. I had to reset it because it got stuck other then that I have had no problem. I would highly suggest a case for it. The one thing that I would like to see changed is the way that the unit is plugged in to be charged. You need a little adapter, its a little bit a pain. If you loose that then you will not be able to download or recharge. I have over 4,000 songs and I still have room for more.

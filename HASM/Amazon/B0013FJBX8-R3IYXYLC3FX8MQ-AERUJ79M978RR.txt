Title: Very elegant and powerful
Content:
My 5 year old 17" Powerbook G4 was showing signs of age so I decided to move up to an Intel based MacBook Pro. Additionally, as a Mac developer, I needed an Intel mac to update my apps to Universal Binary.
I have been a Mac user since the G3 days so have a wide base of comparison. I still have 4 Macs in use in the house. Anyhow, this MacBook Pro is the best of the lot by far, well not by far compared to the 17" Powerbook but still much better.
I was a little concerned about comments re the glossy screen. No problem! It clarifies screen images, and protects as well. The black bezel acts as a frame that contrasts and brings out the beauty of screen images.
The black keys and the back lighting system works wonderfully in this machine update. Positive comments about processor speed, the two video cards, the multi-finger track pad set up and the elegance of OSX 10.5.6 can be found in many other reviews. Additionally, the machine is very quiet and runs cool except for the most arduous computing using the 2 video card option.
My only disappointment is after using a 17" sreen for 5 years, the 15" screen seems a bit tiny-but is is so much lighter the tradeoff is worth it.
I highly recommend this product for both the professional and the casual user.

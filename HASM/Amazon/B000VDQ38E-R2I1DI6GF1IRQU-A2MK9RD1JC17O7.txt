Title: Best. Vacuum. Period.
Content:
First of all if you are reading the reviews your probably leery of buying this. DONT BE! This is probably the best vacuum cleaner i have ever used. We have 3 cats and hair is everywhere. I clean on a weekly basis so my house is for the most part clean. WRONG! After just a few passes i looked in the container just to see what i got.........the contents made me feel like pigpin from charlie brown. This thing is awesome. A few tips.....if it starts to lose cyclone, just take the cyclone out and clean the out the cat you just created with all that hair....also if the bulb goes out it shuts the whole unit down (or so i heard, havent experienced it yet) so just replace it and youll be fine. I would rate this a 10 if i could because this vacuum went beyond my expectations and it will go beyond yours too. (i know what your thinking....i am not a bot, or Billy Mays)

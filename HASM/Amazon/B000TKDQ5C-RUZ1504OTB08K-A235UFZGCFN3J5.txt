Title: Very nice heater
Content:
My house tends to be drafty in places, so I wanted a small, portable heater to warm up the bathroom, bedroom or office in the cold weather. This heater is exactly what I was looking for. It's very quiet, has a low and high setting and a temperature dial so you can adjust it to the right temperature. It's lightweight and easy to move around from room to room if you need to. It's just right for warming up small to medium sized rooms. I've very satisfied with this purchase and the price was great compared to small heaters I've seen elsewhere.

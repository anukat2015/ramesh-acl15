Title: Disappointing
Content:
If you're like me, you're looking for a dustbuster-on-a-stick to suck up golden retriever fur and the odd bit of dirt from 2700 sq ft of concrete floor in between mondo vacuumings.
This ain't it.
Although a tantalizingly beautiful appliance, don't be swayed by its design-y splendor. It doesn't have the power of a handheld Dustbuster. It won't pick up sand or coffee grounds. As others have pointed out, its unusual gliding action is mesmerizing at first, but it becomes tiresome trying to direct it where you want. Its weird triangular nozzle won't do corners or baseboards. I'll be giving mine away to a friend I don't like much.

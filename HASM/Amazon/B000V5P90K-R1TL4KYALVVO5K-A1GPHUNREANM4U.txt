Title: Great Camera
Content:
I have had the Canon D50 and the 20D.  Both of these were great cameras, but the 40D is a major step up!  The camera is well built, full-featured and quiet.  Love the larger screen and bright viewfinder.  I highly recommend this camera!  Works great with my 10-22mm, F1.4 50mm, F2.8 70-200mm IS L and my 24-105nn L lenses.

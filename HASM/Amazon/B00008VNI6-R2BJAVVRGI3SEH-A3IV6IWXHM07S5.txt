Title: Great concept, not so great execution
Content:
I received this as a gift about six months ago, and I was thrilled because I am something of a Decanter Terminator--I am always managing to drop them or crack them or destroy them somehow.  However, the plastic tank that replaces the decanter here is not dishwasher safe.  I rinse it every time I use it, but it stains very easily so now I can't tell from the outside how much coffee is left.  Also, the little white valve thingy at the bottom of the tank is warped or something now.  Jiggling and pressing it back into place works only temporarily.  I now have to keep a small cup wedged under the spout while brewing or I get coffee all over the countertop.  I pulled my old glass decanter coffeemaker out of the cabinet to start using again.
I understand this is an early-model Brewmaster, so these two issues might have been corrected.  I hope so.

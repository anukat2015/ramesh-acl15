Title: Consistently poor quality
Content:
I bought several of these recently, having had one for 8 years that we love and has worked perfectly.  Unfortunately they have changed the manufacturing to apparently use cheaper components.  Both heaters I got had or quickly developed problems.  Customer service was very poor and I had to repeatedly call and email to get replacements sent - one of which did not work right out of the box.  The other has an intermittent problem.
I orignally liked this heater because it was small, powerful, and - I thought - SAFE.  But after numerous problems with recently purchased units - one of which was a burning smell and glowing ember inside that I luckily noticed before it caught fire - I no longer trust them and would never buy or use another.

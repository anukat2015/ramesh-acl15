Title: baller on a budget no brainer
Content:
recieved this laptop from amazon a few weeks back. I have been using it for work mostly with office excel, web browsing watching videos burning DVDs etc. and this machine is very fast especially with windows 7. IMO it is the best deal out there for the money right now. The screen is the perfect size and it is fairly light and thin. The build quality is really good but not as good as a MB pro of course. I was going to pull the trigger on a MB pro instead of this but got this instead for half the price. 
Overall very happy with quality/performance.
It did not come with windows 7 cd's but acer has a built in restore image function in case anything happens to the OS. 
I would still have liked to have the Windows 7 CDs.....

Title: This DSLR Is Great
Content:
I'm barely an amateur photographer, so I'm not going to get technical because I can't.
I own a film SLR, but haven't used it in about 5 years--ever since "quality" digital point-and-shoots flooded the market. I left the film and all of the manual tinkering behind for the ease of use. Now having this camera for a few days, I'm sorry I did that. My latest P&S is a Canon S3 IS, which has a nice zoom and takes good pics. It may never be used again. 
The first thing I immediately noticed is the depth of field that the XSi produced. I forgot how good an SLR could be. Upload the pics to your computer and the clarity and color of the photos are just unbelievable. Night or indoor shooting is equally amazing. I never got good results when I disabled the flash on my P&S cameras, but I am shocked at how well the photos turn out in a low-light situation when not using the flash on this one. 
The camera and lens does feel a bit cheap with all of the plastic. But, I plan on taking care of it, so I'm ok with that. The battery seems to have a lot of juice in it for hundreds of pics before recharging (2 hour charge). I don't see myself using the "live view" function too much. It doesn't really work like a P&S like it may seem. There is no memory card in the kit, which is fine with me since the cards included in most cameras are very low capacity and essentially useless.
I love this camera and wish I would've jumped on a DSLR sooner. Then again, maybe it was well worth the wait...

Still loving this camera in every way after about 3000 pics. Image quality still impresses me and battery life is also very good. Extremely satisfied.

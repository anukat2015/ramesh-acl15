LIKES,,,Great camera, it takes great pictures even in low light without the flash, the auto focus takes a bit of getting us too,,if you move after viewing a subject a little bit it wants to refocus.DISLIKES,,The only thing that I found that I didn't like was the camera had a hard time focusing on things skyward,,I think because of clouds being in view along with the subject, the camera has a hard time trying to figure out what you are taking a picture of,,,maual focus took care of that.

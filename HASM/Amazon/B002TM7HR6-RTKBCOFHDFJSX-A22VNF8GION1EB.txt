Title: OK Computer, but has lots of crapware and poor support
Content:
This laptop seems OK after using it for a month or so. But you will spend a fair amount of time uninstalling the Lenovo crapware that comes pre-installed. Plus, their tech support is awful. If you go to Lenovos site you will find a bunch of broken links, and won't even be able to find the user guide if you need it. You will have to download the user guide from a third party site. My experience with Lenovo so far puts it pretty low on my trusted vendors list.

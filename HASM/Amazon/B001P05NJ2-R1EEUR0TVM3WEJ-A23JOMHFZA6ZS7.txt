Title: Choose this one for cost-performance, but replace to 4G mem and SSD
Content:
Choose this one instead of MB471LL/A(2.53 GHz/4GB RAM/320GB HDD) for cost-preformance.I think MB471LL/A is overpriced for marketing, so choosing the model of this page is wiser.
However, 2GB memory is too tight. You need 4GB memory especially if you run windows on some virtual environment. So buy 2Gx2 DDR3 and replace. 1Gx2 is a waste, but still chepaer than buying at Apple store or buying MB471LL/A.
Also, replacing HDD to SSD is highly recommended. 32G minimam, 64/128G is plenty and enough. Using HDD is such a bottle-neck of this kind fast machine.

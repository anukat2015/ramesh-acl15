Title: not  impressed yet
Content:
I bought this heater today to supplement my main central electric heat because it got too cold in the house having a small baby.  i plugged it in, cranked it on high for about an hour and it is still giving off the most awful smell ever.  i thought it might go away after about 30 minutes, but it is still going.  i had to take it out of the baby's room because i didnt want her to smell the nasty fumes.   Needless to say, I am going to give it a little time because it seems to get pretty warm.

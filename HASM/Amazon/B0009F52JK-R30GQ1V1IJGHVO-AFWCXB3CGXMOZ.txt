Title: broke after 3 months
Content:
I bought this to replace a Farberware percolator which lasted only 1 year.  It brewed extremely slow, but other than that I was satisfied. After 3 months it would not stop brewing unless I unplugged it. I contacted the company because it is under warranty, and was told that they sold their warranty department. After several attempts I have been unable to contact anyone. Complete waste.

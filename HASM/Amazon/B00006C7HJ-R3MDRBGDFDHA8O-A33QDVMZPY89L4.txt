Title: Small but Mighty
Content:
I love my Vornado. Living in Southern California you might not think that you need a heater, but the winter nights can be downright frigid.I bought one for myself as I get cold easily. It is so popular in my house that it's the first thing my sister wants when she's visiting, also my son when he's home from college. It takes the chill off of a room instantly and can warm the whole room in about 15 minutes.It is not hot to the touch,is pet friendly, and seems very safe to use. We are saving energy by using the Vornado instaed of heating the whole house.This heater has really added to the quality of our lives. I am a big fan of this fan!

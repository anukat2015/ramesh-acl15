Title: Piece of junk
Content:
My husband bought me the Nano for my birthday. It has never worked properly. The second it is unplugged from the power source, it goes to sleep and cannot be unfrozen until the battery drains completely, usually a day. This is apparently so frequent a problem that it is the #1 troubleshooting topic on the Apple support site. The Nano cannot transfer from mac to pc, despite the USB hookup. Customer service is virtually non-existent.  On-line support consists email suggesting articles to read.  The end.  I decided finally after six months and 20 days to send the thing back, something I did not want to do because my Nano is engraved. Because I crossed the six month line, I have to pay $33 for shipping and handling because it has to arrive in THEIR box. The disclaimer page removes virtually all responsibility for anything needing repair and includes (starts off with) the promise to charge $100 for diagnostics unless a miracle occurs and they think the problem is actually on their end.  If they actually fix the problem without charging me $100 or more, I will eat my Nano..

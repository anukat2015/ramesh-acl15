Title: Yes, It's "Just" a Vacuum Cleaner, but...
Content:
I was getting really tired of buying a new vacuum cleaner from Wallyworld every two or three years.  When it was time to buy yet another one, I did some research online and discovered a world of expensive vacuums that I never knew existed.  But did I want to pay that much?  With Miele's reputation and seven-year motor warranty, plus more exhaustive research, [...], I decided to take the plunge.  I never realized how well my other vacuum cleaners DIDN'T clean!  No more exhaustively passing the vacuum over the same area over and over--this gets the mess up in one pass.  I have pets and children (=big messes!), so I have to replace the bag every two weeks or so, but that's a small price to pay for such an efficient machine. I chose the Leo canister because it has a HEPA filter and a hard floor tool, which is great on the ceramic tile floor that makes up most of the flooring in my house.  With just a little carpet to clean, the less-expensive SEB217-3 power head is sufficient for me rather than the SEB236 upgrade. It still cleans better than any of my old vacuums.  And did I mention how quiet it is?  It's not silent, but it's a whole lot quieter than I anticipated.  The dogs and cats still don't like it, though :)

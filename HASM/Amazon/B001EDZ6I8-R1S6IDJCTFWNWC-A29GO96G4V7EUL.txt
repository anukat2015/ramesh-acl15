Title: Great heater and Great Manufacturer Customer Service
Content:
This is a wonderful little heater that I bought form an Amazon store (Bostic Outfitters).  I recently moved to a home office situation and my new office is in the basement of our home in Minneapolis.  Needless to say the floors are cold and even with slippers on, the cold radiates up my legs and makes my feet cold and my knees stiff.  I looked at several personal heaters for my situation and liked the design of the "Vornado EH1-0039-06 225-Watt SoleAire Foot Rest and Personal Space Heater".  When it arrived, the "High" heat setting did not function (just blew cold air on my feet, not what I was looking for).  I contacted Vornado via their 800 number and told them the problem.  They only asked for the serial number of the device, and are shipping me a replacement at no charge with only a 5 minute phone call.  When asked what I should do with the defective unit, I was told to "cut the cord and dispose of it properly".  That is great customer service! I will use the defective unit on the "Low" heat setting until the replacement comes, then I will be set! the Vornado representative said that they wanted me to be delighted with their products and since the initial product was not performing up to specifications, they would rather send me a new on and dispense with any  further inconvenience in getting a working product.  I will be happy to buy more products from Vornado and recommend them as well.

Title: AWESOME!!!

All I can say is WOW!! I love this vacuum!! I think the problem some people are having with the turbo tool, maybe they are just pushing it down too hard, I have a Siberian Huskey and a Chow/Shepard mix, so I have 3 types of hair to pick up, and the tool worked GREAT on my odd fabric couch!! As for the carpet, my god! We too have new carpet, and it pulled up all the crap there was to grab!! We have gone thru 5 vacuums, in the past 6 years, unless something realllly wrong happens in the next few month, I am sure to keep enjoying this vacuum. The canister is a little small I will say that, but, as far as I'm concerned its worth it! And I've read some say its heavier, I'm not young but not old either, but I don't think its that heavy, and its self propelled so, unless your in REALLLY bad shape physically then most people shouldnt have an issue with the weight.

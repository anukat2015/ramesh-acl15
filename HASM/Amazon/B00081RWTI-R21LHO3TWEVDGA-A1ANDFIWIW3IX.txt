Title: Great coffee maker
Content:
This system is really great, if you have time for the cleaning process.  It takes a fair amount of time to disaasemble the grinder, (2 parts) the basket (3 parts if not using paper filters, 2 if you do) and the carafe (2 parts) for cleaning.
We fill the machine and program for AM start, have our AM coffee, hit the door for work and then clean it in the PM when doing dinner dishes. (Then fill it for the next AM coffee)
The carafe keeps the coffee really hot if rinsed with hot water in the AM. It's a very nice product!

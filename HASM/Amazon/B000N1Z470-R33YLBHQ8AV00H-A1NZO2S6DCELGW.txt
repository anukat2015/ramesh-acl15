Title: Perfect to warm up a cold bedroom
Content:
Have been using this for a month now and couldn't be happier.  I am so pleased with the thermostat feature as this ensures a good consisntency in the temperature of our bedroom.  Its just not cold enough to turn the whole house heater on overnight but the bedroom does get a little chilly so this was perfect to only warm up our bedroom temp. It is very quiet and does not wake us up at night when it goes on.  Love the remote control feature too. Definitely recommend.

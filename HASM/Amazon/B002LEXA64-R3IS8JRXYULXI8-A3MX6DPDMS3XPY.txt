Title: Sticky Thumb pad
Content:
I have had this laptop for over a month now and have enjoyed all its features.  I use it for my school work, taking notes, spreadsheets, etc.  It gets the job done.  The only drawback of this machine is that the thumbpad is supersticky.  Given the amount of time that I spend on it, the skin on my finger tips is peeling off.  I think it is a poor design flaw on acer's part.  If it wasnt for this one factor the laptop would get the maximum rating.

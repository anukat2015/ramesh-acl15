Title: I Loved It ....Now......My Wife Loves It
Content:
I initially bought this for myself and loved everything about it except it didn't take long for me to run out of storage space. My taste in music (Jazz & Classical) is often comprised of extended works that exceed the necessary space that would be required to accomodate the average contemporary popular song. I decided the 80GB IPod would suit my purposes better in allowing me to contain a large portion of my extensive CD collection in one convenient device without having to be concerned with being so selective in my download choices. I gave the 4GB IPod to my wife (whose taste in music is a bit more 'Pop' oriented) and it wound up being perfect for her needs.

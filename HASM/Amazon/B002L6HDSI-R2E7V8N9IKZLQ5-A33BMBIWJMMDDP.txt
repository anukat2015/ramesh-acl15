Title: very good overall
Content:
I really like to pack light and that is why for a few years when I travel and work out I've relied on my ipod shuffle. I am not a "machead" or ipod/iphone cheerleader. I am not a tech head and I prefer function over form. I purchased this nano for very specific purposes: working out and travel. I wanted more storage than my shuffle. Therefore I am probably a "low use" user so my review is in that context. 
I have not used the video camera or video playing features but at some point I suppose I will. In fact I would have bought this ipod nano even without these features. The sound quality seems a bit better than the shuffle and the storage (16gb) is incredible. I travel about 80K miles by air a year and this new nano will serve me well.
The only issue thus far is the seemingly short battery life. I almost wonder if mac saved space/money/weight by skimping on the battery? Or perhaps it is just the unit I received? Nevertheless, as long as I plan ahead this is largely a non-issue.
In sum, I am pleased with the ipod nano 5th gen and look forward to getting a lot of use out of it.

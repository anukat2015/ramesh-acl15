Title: Worst heater I ever bought
Content:
I bought this heater because of the great reviews it got.  This is the worst heater I ever bought and was a complete waste of forty dollars.  I plugged it in and turned it on, with the low setting and highest temp.  An hour later the temperature in my bathroom had not gone up and the heater wasn't even hot in the front where the hot air comes out.  If I could return it I would.  I bought a $20. heater half the size of this one, from Walmart, and it heats my bathroom in 10 minutes.  My bathroom is about 40 degrees in the morning (I live in the high desert), so maybe this heater is not designed for really chilly temps.  If you need real heat, don't buy this heater.

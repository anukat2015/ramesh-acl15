Title: I love my Hoover Bagless Canister Vac
Content:
I love my Hoover Canister Vac.  It's quiet, handles easily, picks up very well on rugs as well as bare floors.  I especially like the device used for cleaning furniture and drapes. The different suction settings are conveniently located on the handle. It is easily stored in a small area.

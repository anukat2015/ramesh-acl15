Title: Am I the only one that had this problem?
Content:
I must have got 2 defective ones. I bought this Hoover after my other one finally gave up the ghost after 20 yrs.
After 2 weeks I noticed that the machine wasn't cleaning as well and I couldn't hear the power brush in the head running when on carpet. It ran when lifted up but stopped when put down, you could stop the brush with your hand. I took it apart and checked the belt it was very loose. 
I thought about getting a new belt but this thing was brand new so I took it back to Home depot and they gladly gave me a refund. I went back and looked at their vac cleaners again and decided to get the same kind again, I liked the design and the way it worked while it was working. Maybe bad luck.
Fired up the new one and went to work, I noticed that it would bog down on my area rug and carpet in the bedroom, after about 30 min the brush would stop turning on the carpet and I could stop it with my hand. 
Same %@#* problem! What a POS!
I am returning this one ASAP and shopping for another.

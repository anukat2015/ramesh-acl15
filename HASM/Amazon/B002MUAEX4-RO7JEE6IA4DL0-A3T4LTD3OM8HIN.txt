Title: Good all around
Content:
This camera lives up to the promise of delivering SLR-like results with a (somewhat large) digital camera size and form factor.  I would give this baby four and a half stars if I could, but amazon makes me choose either 4 or 5.  The lens is superior, especially for its small size.  The pictures and movies the camera produces are of fine quality, no real complaints.  For an SLR user, the lack of a viewfinder may require some getting used to, but it is a necessary sacrifice to achieve the small size.  IMO the main downside of this camera is the interface.  The menu system is rather convoluted, features like flash exposure compensation require scrolling through a 5-page menu to find the right option.  The 'MY Menu' function is not user-configurable, only storing the several most recent menu accesses.  If you are used to using a Canon or Nikon DSLR, this (other than the lack of a viewfinder) is probably the one big feature you will miss:  being able to access any function you would like to in an instant.  Most of the common features are accessible with a button on the panel, and the Fn button is assignable to one of several features depending on your liking.  But they really need to make the 'My Menu' user-configurable or give you some other way to get at the important features that are otherwise buried deep within a 4 or 5 page menu.  The AE/AF button is also somewhat configurable, but this, one assignable button, and a useless 'My Menu' feature just wouldn't cut it if this were a modern DSLR.  Maybe a firmware update can fix this?  I hope, either way, it's a great camera and I can certainly live with it, no other significant complaints.

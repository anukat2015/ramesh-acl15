Title: Exactly what I was looking for in a lightweight laptop and Screen Flicker Issue solved
Content:
Just purchased this laptop the Satellite T153D-S1325RD.  First, the screen flickering issue, which I experienced as well when I was using Explorer.  Toshiba has an update for the video driver at [...] which completely resolves any flickering issues.  Just download the updated driver and the flickering completely stops.  
The Laptop boots up quick and the resolution on it is fantastic.  The other thing I love is how lightweight it is.  The 13.3" screen is large enough to be easy on the eyes but when folder shut, it's slim and takes very little room.  I'm using this as my personal computer and will be taking it on business trips along with by business laptop.  It's light and thin enough that it easily fits in my backpack and takes very little room.
The touch pad takes a little getting used to and is very sensitive.  I need to change the sensitivity of it.  The keyboard is also hard to get used to.  The keys are so slick and glossy that it makes it hard for your fingers to grip as you're typing.  Would be nice if they put as little bit of texture on the keys.  I'm starting to get used to it but not as easy to type as my Work HP Laptop.
Pros:
Resolution and HD Output
Lightweight
Thin
Fast Startup
Large 320GB HD and 4GB RAM
Laptop Appearance - Red Laptop is beautiful
Cons:
Keyboard
OVERALL:  This is an outstanding lightweight, very thin laptop.  It's so easy and portable but also has the great space on the HD to save photos, videos etc.  I'm ecstatic, this machine is the best.  Very happy I purchased it.  The flicker issue is resolved with the Video Driver download and you have a great laptop!

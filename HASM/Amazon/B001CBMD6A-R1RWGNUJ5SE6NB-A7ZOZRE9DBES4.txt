Title: Canon Rebel XS
Content:
This is a great camera. It's light but durable. The controls are easy to use and sensible. The kit lens is much better than kit lenses on the previous digital Rebels. And the image stabilizer really works. It would be nice to have higher ISO than 1600. But images taken at ISO 1600 have less "noise" than with my original digital Rebel or my XTi. Great camera.

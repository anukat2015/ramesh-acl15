Title: It's best to keep looking
Content:
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for myself. I've used the espresso part a few times and it works great. It's the first I've had, so I've nothing which to compare it.  The coffeemaker part - I hate to say this - is the worst I've ever had. The coffee makes slowly, is much too cool, and the carafe has an itty bitty spout so it drips everywhere, no matter how slowly you pour it.
After three weeks of use, the coffeemaker side no longer works. There is an internal component inside (I think my brother said it goes to the pump) that MELTED during routine use. 
When I purchased this unit, I did a little research and I was prepared for the espresso maker to go first, but the coffeemaker last only weeks floored me! I've had it to long to return it for a refund to get something else, so I'm hoping it doesn't cost me a ton to ship it to be replaced.

Title: Dirt Devil Breeze vac
Content:
I wanted a vac to use on my laminate flooring. One which would be easy to use.  This fits the bill perfectly.  It does great on bare flooring!! However, the attachment for rugs is not so great.  It is stiff and does not turn at all.  The angle of the attachment to the rug is wrong.  That could be the problem.  But as I have said, I only wanted it for bare flooring.  It is easy to clean and easy to put back together.  I would buy it again, as it suits MY needs.

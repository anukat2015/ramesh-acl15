Title: Amazing heater, More than worth its Price
Content:
I love this heater and I would buy another one even if the price was doubled.  The only reason I haven't bought another one this year is that so far this winter, it hasn't been that cold and the vornado DVTH heater that I did buy last year is working well enough to heat up all 4 rooms of my Philadelphia PA 3rd floor row house apartment (all the rooms open up to each other and I have this heater running in the middle room. My ceilings are also not high). I never had to turn on my central gas heater last year (2005).  As the reviews suggest, make sure you get the DVTH model of this heater and *not* the DVH. In my case, it takes about 10 - 20 minutes to get the room where it is running to the temperature I set (70 degrees) but the *whole* room feels and stays warmed up not just the area around the heater. The heated air circulates and warms up my other rooms also so that within the hour my entire apartment is warm enough that I can wear a long sleeved t-shirt and be comfortable.  My electric bill increased about $100 more a month when I had this heater running continously for at least 25 days last year which is less than the $200 - $250 increased in my gas bill if I had used my central heat. One thing to note is that when I turned it on for the first time this year, there was a burning smell which I think is from the dust that collected in it over the summer so its probably a good idea to pack it away when it is not being used.  It only had the burning smell the first time it was turned on and the heater was ok after that.

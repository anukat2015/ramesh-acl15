Title: Amazing suction!
Content:
The first time I used this vacuum, I could not believe how much cat hair, dust, and lint it pulled out of an 8x10 area rug. This rug is only 3 months old and obviously my old vacuum was not getting the stuff out! It filled up the entire cannister!!! I love this vacuum, it is a great bargain for the price of 99.00. I like the fact that some of the tubing and brush covers are clear, to see what's going on inside. The only 2 cons are that 1) the mini turbo pet hair brush attachment does not adjust for vertical vacuuming. It works well on a horizontal surface, but is awkward for vertical surfaces, such as the back of a chair. 2) the brush does not shut off for bare wood floors. Otherwise; love it!

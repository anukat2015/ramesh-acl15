Title: Great while it works
Content:
I've had one of these for a year and a half, and while it still makes great coffee, it also makes a great mess as it's developed a leak where the side of the pot is joined with the bottom. Customer service (It's not even Farberware anymore) was polite but firm that the one-year warranty was up. Unlike the other person who was offered a refurbished unit, I didn't even get that option. Oh well, they used to be a good name, but now that they're made offshore by a different company, they appear to be disposable.

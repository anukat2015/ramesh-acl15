Title: Thumbs up
Content:
I've had this laptop for about a month now. I'm in the IT business for 9 years. My past career was in Electronics. I own multiple desktops and laptops with various OS.
 I love this laptop! I use it for work and play. No BSOD for me. I also own most gaming consoles like wii, ps3, 360, ds,psp, game boy and xbox. 
I have no problems watching movies on this. I've played Dragon age and Wolfenstein with no issues. I burn DVDs with no issues. From you tube to CBTs, they all work great!
For work apps, I use Visio, Office for creating presentations, spreadsheets, tools that monitor or configure networks, etc and I have no problems at all. I run some good apps for security, anti-virus and spyware. I tried taxing this laptop and haven't been able to slow this thing down yet. I know there are sites out there that test laptop performance but I only care for it's performance on how I use it. 
It comes with a cool backpack that could easily sell for [...] bucks along with a gaming mouse. I've already loaded all kinds of things on my laptop and so far so good. Proper housekeeping is assumed. I never load anything on the same partition where my window OS resides. 
I also bought a notebook cooler and it's very possible that this is keeping me from getting the BSOD. Heat is a killer on any electronic device. This is why you get the 3 ring of death on a popular gaming console. Happened to my console and I fixed it myself. Bought a cooler for that console too. The heat couldnt be dissipated fast enough. 
Get a laptop cooler when you buy this laptop and you should be ok. I hear they may modify this laptop by toning down the GPU. This decreases the performance but keeps it cool enough to be less of a problem. well, when I play my games, I want it to kick butt!! So, when you do play some high res games, make sure you have it on a laptop cooler. 
For me, having the laptop cooler at all times is not a problem and it feels cooler on my lap because of the air flow. 
To summarize the  pros:
-HDMI makes games, movies, etc look awesome!
-Fast fast fast bootup.
-Windows 7 works great for me!
--Love the backpack!
Love the mouse!
-partitioned by default so you can keep you apps apart from your OS.
-lit keyboard makes life easier when using at night.
-Love the manual switch to turn off bluetooth/wireless access. This is good when you don't want your apps to go out to the internet for updates when your security tools aren't up and running yet during bootup.
-Screen size is perfect. Big yet not too big like a 17 inch. I have friends that end up buying two laptops. One 17 inch and one smaller for portability. This defeats the purpose of getting a laptop I think.
-Warranty is awesome. Two years coverage. First year covers stuff they shouldn't even have to covered. You should never get coverage for spilling a drink on your laptop. This is just laptop abuse. 30 day coverage for white pixel issues (Mine had none).
-Looks good and feels sturdy.
- 4 USB ports. I've hooked up the laptop cooler, external hard drive, wireless mouse on it already so four USB ports are perfect.
- Price 
- Wireless setup was so easy, it almost set itself up except of course for the secret password.
- Scroll option on the mouse pad is nice.
Cons:
-Battery lasts for only about an hour.
- Left and right click on mouse pad is too hard to press. It should match the keyboard pressure.
- Customizing the text size was not the easiest to do. Lots of squinting before I finally got it sized right. Custom DPI sizing didn't work.
- Runs hot so you really need to have the laptop cooler under it.
- Speakers are too quiet at times. 
- Fingerprint magnet
- wish it came in different colors.
- upgrade to 8 Gig not possible or at least I don't think it is. 
Overall? Good quality and the price makes it an awesome purchase. Remember, get the laptop cooler. I also bought a powered usb hub so I don't draw too much power from the laptop making it more hot.

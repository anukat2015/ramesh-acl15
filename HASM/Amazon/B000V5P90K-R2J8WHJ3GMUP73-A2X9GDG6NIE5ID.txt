Title: Canon 40D Review
Content:
The Canon 40D DSLR is a great camera.  I own the 10D which I have been exceedingly happy with, but the 40D offers some great improvements.  The larger LCD monitor and the information screens provide essential data about the images.  I particularly like the capability to shoot just RAW files. The 10MB file size facilitates enlargements w/o using 3rd party software. Also I like the capability to change the picture style.  The 10D doesn't have those features.  I set the camera to the neutral style with Aperture-Priority and have been getting great exposures. My primary zoom is the EF24-105mm F4L IS USM lens.  I have to get use to the 95% coverage looking through the viewfinder, but that's not an issue. I highly recommend the 40D to those currently using the 10 and 20D bodies and are planning to up grade.

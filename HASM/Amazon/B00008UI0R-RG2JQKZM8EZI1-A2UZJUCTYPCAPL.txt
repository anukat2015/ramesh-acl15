Title: Bad design, no customer service, don't purchase
Content:
I bought this vacuum and used it only 3 times to vacuum several rooms. My house is small so the total time used each time was less than 15 minutes.  So far, the belt on the wand has fallen off 3 times.  Now it won't stay on at all. If the brush is not rotating, the vacuum doen't work.  Service has consisted of Hoover telling me to take the machine to a service center. I'm so disgusted with Hoover and will never purchase their products again.  Note, many of the other unhappy users on this string have experienced the same problem.

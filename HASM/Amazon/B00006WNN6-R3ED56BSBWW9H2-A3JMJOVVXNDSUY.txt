Title: Superb little heater - excellent performance for the money
Content:
For the very small sum that this heater costs, one can only give it top marks. It is best used in smaller rooms, which it can heat up quietly, and quickly. Given its design one can go to sleep with it on, and not worry about smells, leakages, etc. Also, it's fine to use with kids around and no concerns on this front. It won't make much of a dent on larger, cold rooms, but for its low price, this is an unreasonable expectation. My only suggestion would be to include an on/off switch - currently plugging it in activates the unit. In sum, though, this small heater is a big asset and will very quickly pay for itself through lower heating (gas) bills.

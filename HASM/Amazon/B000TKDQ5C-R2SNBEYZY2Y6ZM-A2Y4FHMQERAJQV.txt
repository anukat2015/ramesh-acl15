Title: Good little heater
Content:
It does what it's supposed to do and does it well. I keep under my computer desk for use in the winter and I run it on power level 1 (low). Level 2 gets too warm. The thermostat is very good also. It's rare (in my experience) to find a thermostat that actually behaves as it should to maintain a steady temperature and this does just that.

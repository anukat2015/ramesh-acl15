Title: Superb state of the art Olympus E-3
Content:
WOW... finally a camera that gives you the sharpness and quality you were always looking for. Five stars to Olympus, well done. The camera is a little bit bigger that previous E-series, a little bit heavier too, well built, very compact and robust, but most importantly feels very comfortable in hands. I'm very impressed by the results, great vivid colors, excellent sharpness, fast autofocus. Low light performance is superb especially with the awesome mechanical stabilization system, even with high ISO (quite a jump from previous E series). I am not a fan of LCD live viewing, but honestly it's of great help is some circumstances (like ground-level or night shots)... especially because you're able to see the changes on light and contrast as you change the values of your depth of field or aperture velocity... this feature allows you to adjust and achieve the right exposure before every shot (although the results are not quite accurate... the pre-shooting live image is pretty close to the actual result). Strongly recommended if you take photography seriously. Money well invested.
Disavantages: strap is of poor quality... other than that very impressive camera.

Title: very sweet entry body for SLR
Content:
when buying an SLR the important thing is to also look at lens avalable also and the two makers of bodys and lens are only cannon and nikon and cannon is less expensive for a similar quality and features so a winner there and also cannons pro level white telephoto lens totaly rule which is quite aparent as if you ever see a bank of photoprgathers at a sporting event all you tend to see is a sea of white lens sadly for those lens which will fit on this body start well over twice the price of this body 
also another note buying a body with out a lens is not a bad idea as the first thing that gets replaced tends to be the medicore kit len

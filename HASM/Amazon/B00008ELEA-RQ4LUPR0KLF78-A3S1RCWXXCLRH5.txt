Title: Great coffee crummy cord
Content:
I am now a die-hard percolator fan.  I feel downright "snobby" now when I drink coffee.  I even threw my old drip away.  This baby is great, but within three months, the cord developed a bad connection and I have to hold the cord in order make it perk.  I'm more in need of my morning cup than I am afraid of getting shocked.  I'm now purchasing a Farberware stove top perk.

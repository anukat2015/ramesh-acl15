Title: Everything I expected
Content:
Wanting to move up from a point and click camera to a DSLR, I researched the information on the internet about Canon, Sony, Nikon and Olympus cameras.  I wanted a camera that takes good quality pictures in low light situations.  My Olympus D560 and Nikon Coolpix 200 both take decent outdoor, normal light conditions, but not in low light conditions.  Many reviews were helpful and it came down to a decision between Canon and Nikon.  The D40 felt better in my hands from the standpoint of weight and ergonomic layout of buttons.  The D40 has excellent refresh rate when the built-in flash is used, which is horrible on the point and click cameras.  I am still learning how to use all of the manual and P-S-A modes but the tests I have done so far give excellent picture quality results. The low light test pictures have been great in auto and manual settings.  I need to get a tripod to achieve better long-exposure pictures to get the quality of pictures others have posted in reviews.  I would recommend the D40 for people wanting to enter the DSLR world.  The best advise and information came from Ken Rockwell's site:  http://www.kenrockwell.com/index.htm
His site also lead me to Amazon for the best price when I decided to buy. Thanks Ken, Amazon and Nikon.

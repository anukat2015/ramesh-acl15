Title: Great bang for the buck!
Content:
Wow! IF you're looking for a great deal, the D50 just might suit you. 4 stars for the slightly lacking feature set, but I probably wouldn't use them anyways. Get a telephoto lens, some filters (esp. circular polarizers), a good case, another battery, a flash (I'm happy with the SB-600), rechargeable AAs for the flash, and at least 2 gigabytes (read Sandisk Ultra II) and you'll be set for life. 
You'll probably want a card reader for your computer, too. It's faster than the camera's transfer mode is, doesn't waste battery power, and is WAY faster than the reader built into your laptop.

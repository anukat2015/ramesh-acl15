Title: So Far, So Good
Content:
This vacuum is a great value in that it is very similar in design to the Dyson line of vacs, but costs less than half the price.  Got my unit at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, usually a good store to deal with.  As others have indicated, the chamber fills quickly, and the moisture takes longer than 24 hours to dissipate after you clean it.  Does a great job of getting stuff off the carpet that my old Kenmore couldn't get.  What's interesting is that the March 2007 Consumer Reports rated the Kenmore higher than the Dyson, which doesn't make sense to me.  Go figure.

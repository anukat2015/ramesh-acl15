Title: Excellent battery life
Content:
I bought this iPod after my iPod classic got wet and stopped working. I love this iPod, the battery life is extensive. I listen to mine at work every day for almost 8 hrs a day and sometimes at the gym afterward for another hour and I only have to charge maybe every 3 days or so. I love the coverflow design and screen resolution is superb. Apple makes some wonderful high quality products. I strongly recommend this one.

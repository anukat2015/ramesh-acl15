I think the computer is really nice, most of the pre installed software works well. The processor allow to have been running more than 4 or 5 programs at a time.
besides that, I have to say that win vista is not what I should desire. I have a hibernation serious problem, the commputer wakes up alone, one or two hours later, this is really annoying cause, sometimes it's in the suitcase, or some enclosed compartment. I have tried a lot of solutions but still this problems get out of my nerves sometimes.
Another thing is with the office, sometimes it freezes maybe one or two minutes so I can't continuew with my job.
I hope the instalation of the win 7, solve this problems, meanwhile I would be really dessapointed.

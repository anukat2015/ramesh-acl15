Title: Great Machine

Ok, so far I love it. Nothing to really add to any reviews that are already here, just my 2 cents. There are some drawbacks, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. 
  The size is great, very thin and very very light. The finish is definitely the worlds biggest fingerprint magnet though, the top and the inside. 
Heat wise it stays really cool. The ASUS utilities to switch GPUs and overclocking are a little weird at first but you get used to them. 
Speakers are decent, pretty good for a laptop. 
 I think the screen is good. Many people are complaining saying the colors are washed out and the viewing angles are low. Well, on mine, the colors look really good, and the viewing angles are low, but no more than any other laptop that doesn't cost a couple grand. 
The wireless works great too. Some have complained about the hard drive making noise, but maybe they are just people who have not heard many hard drives, as I actually think its pretty quiet. No problems with creaking or weird things like that on mine. I did have a problem I have read others have had where there was a strange white square in the middle of the screen, not dead pixels just a blank spot that was only in the wallpaper. It went away after 5 minutes though.
Battery life seems pretty titan so far, I played with it all day at work, transferring files from an external and playing mp3's and still got 6 hours. That was on Quiet Office mode.

Title: Very Warm, but Noisy
Content:
I bought this heater because the reviews were quite positive, and it's cheap. (I just got out of college, so student loans lean my decisions toward thrifty spending.)
I opted for Free Shipping, which took about a week, and was well worth it.
My heater arrived, and immediately I opened it up and plugged it in.
The child-safety knob is a little awkward, but it works. It's like opening a bottle of medication, it's a little fussy sometimes because of the efficiency of the child-safety-ness, but it works. It took me a minute to understand the difference between Low-Med-High though. I had thought that the settings were for the fan speed, but rather they're for the amount of head that comes out of the unit.. So, Low heat, Med heat, High heat - and the temp of the heat coming out is set on the temperature knob.. It's a little confusing, but it makes sense after about a minute.
Other than that, it's great. I didn't think my room was warm until I went into the living room and realized how cold the rest of the house was. Haha. And, after you leave the unit on for a little while at high, on the warmest temperature, your room will be VERY toasty. It's great!
It's a bit noisy, so I don't recommend it for a baby's room or an office, but it's fine to sleep with if you're ok with ambient noise. And, most importantly, it's very VERY good at heating up a room!

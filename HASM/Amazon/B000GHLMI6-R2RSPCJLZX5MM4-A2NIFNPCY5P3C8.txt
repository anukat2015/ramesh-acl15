Title: I was disappointed in the Brewmaster
Content:
I was disappointed, not because of the performance, it makes good coffee quickly and keeps it warm for 2 hours.  The thing that really diappointed me was that it wouldn't fit under my cupboards in my kitchen,  it is about 1/4 inch too tall.  Never thought about this when I ordered it, as I supposed dimensions were listed, so it is my own fault.  I suggest if you consider it to measure your space.

Title: JUNK
Content:
We never had good luck with Cuisinart coffee makers.  We have had both this type as well as the standard 10-cup coffee maker from Cuisinart, and I can honestly say they should stay away from producing coffee makers.  Their other kitchen appliances seem to work well just not their coffee makers!
This particular one is a complete piece of junk.  The filter is a pain to put in.  The coffee either comes out hot (when it works!) or messy (when it bombs!).   Does not distribute well between two cups. Everything on it feels  so flimsy and cheap.

Title: We like it!
Content:
We chose this make and model mainly for the rating it received in Consumer Reports magazine.  When we read the reviews on Amazon, we were a little worried that we made the wrong choice.  
We received it and have been using it for about three weeks now and we use it every morning.  It's great.  It does everything a coffee maker should do and the carafe pours great.  One of the best Coffee Makers we have ever purchased.

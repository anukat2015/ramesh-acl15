Title: No suction at all!
Content:
I was excited to order this item, thinking it would be great for little messes. It took me a while to order, but I finally gave in and paid the $50. What a mistake! This has got to be one of the most over-priced and disappointing purchase I have made in a long time. It has absolutely no suction power, it will not even pick up feathers! I would highly recommend avoiding this item. Find a dyson product, they are amazing and really do what they are supposed to. This was my first dirt devil, and IT WILL BE MY LAST!

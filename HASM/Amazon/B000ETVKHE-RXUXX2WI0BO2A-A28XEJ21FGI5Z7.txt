Title: Good unit, a few issues
Content:
I chose the Sansa e260 4GB because I read reviews about it online that said it had an expansion slot for a microSD up to 8GB.  This would allow me to put all my music on the player.  When I got it, it would not read the 8GB microSD card.  I found out that the version I bought was an older version of the same model number, and it only handles 2GB.  SanDisk should have given different model numbers to the old and newer models so people like me wouldn't be tricked into buying the wrong item.  Also, the seller and Amazon should have posted the 2GB limit on the microSD card for this purchase.  They didn't, so buyer beware!  Ask questions before you buy!
My second issue is the volume.  There is only two volume setting on this unit, and both are too low.  I plug my mp3 player into a boom box so I can listen to it without headphones.  I have to crank the volume on the box excessively in order to hear it.  Thankfully, I only use it at work where I have to keep the volume at a low level.  But if I wanted to do the same at home, I wouldn't be able to crank it up without passing into the boom boxes distortion level.  
The random play feature is excellent.  It baffles me why other manufactures don't include this feature.  Who wants to listen to the same songs, in the same order, every day?  Also the e260 menu system is very easy to use.
Bottom line, if I had to purchase another mp3 player, I wouldn't purchase a SanDisk again unless they fix the volume level and change thier model number system so they don't have the same number for players with differing capacity.

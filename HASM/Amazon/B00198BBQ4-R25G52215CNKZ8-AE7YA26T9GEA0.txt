Title: Inspiron 1525
Content:
Pros: Good price at the time, fast and functional for surfing the net, word processing, and quickbooks.
Cons: Fan comes on occasionally and is pretty annoying. Battery life could be better, touchpad isnt too bad, i just unistalled the software that came with is so i dont use the scroll bars on it and im ok with it. Black finish collects finer prints and everything that touches it leaves a mark. Glossy screen is near impossible to see outside.
I have to say this is a pretty descent laptop for the price - you get what you pay for, but you might find a better deal for the price if your lucky.

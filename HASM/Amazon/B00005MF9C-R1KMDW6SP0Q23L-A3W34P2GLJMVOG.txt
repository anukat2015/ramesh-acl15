Title: Great for people-on-the-go/small living spaces
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a housewarming gift for my new studio apartment. The compact size is perfect for my limited space. It also brews a cup of coffee in a matter of minutes, making it perfect for the times when you're running late. Plus it's great to not have to deal with a paper filter; just rinse out the permanent filter and you're set. All in all, I'm very, very pleased with this coffee maker.Regarding a couple of comments below:1. I inadvertently tried to turn the machine on when there was no water in the reservoir and it would not turn on; no fire hazard there.2. I've only had the machine overflow when I tried to use too fine a grind in the basket.3. I've had no trouble pouring water from the mug into the reservoir.4. I've not noticed a rubbery taste in coffee brewed into the accompanying travel mug. If there is one, a thorough washing should eliminate that.

Title: VERY BAD PRODUCT & HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
Content:
I paid $437.00 for this air conditioner.   It worked very well for 30 days and then it began to leak severely.  It drenched my carpet!  I've been dealing with Soleusair since about mid July and it's been an awful experience.  Phone tag...e-mail tag... lots of excuses about their phones being inoperative, and first they asked for copies of receipts (OK that's reasonable) and now I am being asked to provide a tracking number from the shipper (give me a break!).  It's obvious that the company's tactic is to harass their disgruntled customers until they give up and go away.  I will most likely have to pay about $70.00 to ship this junk back.  I will never buy another soleusair product especially over the internet!

Title: Crappy Design, but heated well
Content:
Right out of the box, this heater made a extremely loud noise. It sounded like the fan was bad by the loud clicking.
I took it apart to find out that the fan was ok, but the wiring wasn't secured in any way and it was actually being hit by the fan. Would have been a matter of time had it been left running before the wires insulation whittled down and exposed the wires causing a short and possible spark/fire.
On top of that, the little red button on the face was broken off.
As far as heating, it was good.

Title: iLove!
Content:
I love it! Does everything for entertainment. I am having surgery and need to be out of work all summer, in the bed for at least a week and I wanted to be able to listen to music, read, and not get bored. I've already downloaded a bunch of free Kindle books and actually enjoyed reading (so I don't have to get a Kindle yet), my music, and a bunch of free apps.
My only complaint is the headphones are painful and sound quality is poor. I have small ears and most bud phones are iritating. Luckily my RCA headphones (best headphones EVA!) came to the rescue. Now I can honestly say the music sounds awesome and I am very happy!!

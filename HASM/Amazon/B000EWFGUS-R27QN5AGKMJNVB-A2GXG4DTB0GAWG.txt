Title: Very disappointing
Content:
First of all, this machine is enormous.  I had to rearrange my countertop to accommodate it, and it's so tall that I have to pull it all the way forward and turn it to the side in order to fully open the lid.  The housing is cheap, bendable plastic.  The worst part is that the carafe leaks badly between the red plastic rim and the glass.  Could this thing be any more cheaply made?  I doubt it!  I really like my Hamilton Beach blender and thought the coffee maker would be of equal quality.  NOT.  I wouldn't recommend it.

Title: Big time problems but I love the unit
Content:
We are on our 3rd unit in 2 years.  Two of the units had electronic problems and 1 leaked all over the place.  I love the idea but they MUST get better quality control.  To Conair's credit they have replaced all 3 units.  The first 2 cost $10 each plus the return postage and the last one they sent it free of charge but I still had to pay for postage $12.

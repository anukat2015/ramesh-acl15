Title: Yikes! - Trips GFI
Content:
My unit arrived in good shape and in timely fashion, but, I will be returning it because it trips my GFI (causes my power to shut off). This happened both times I plugged it in and let it run for 10-15 minutes. My Lasko 754200 ceramic heater (got on Amazon for around $20)has never caused a GFI trip, and is comparable in size and "sound" (and I think puts out a little more heat). I suggest the Lasko!

Title: Love my new Mac
Content:
So I finally moved from Windows to Mac and really enjoy it. The MBP 15in is a great machine an I'm glad I bought it. It is such a sleek machine and the battery life is crazy! I never knew I could have such a great laptop. All the Window based laptops are built so cheap and bulky. This machine is slim and solid. All in all a great machine that is working excellent :)

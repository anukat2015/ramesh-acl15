Title: By far the best camera for its price range.
Content:
my reserach into  DSLRs started in 2006 with the original Digital Rebel. DSLRs changed my photography for the better like nothing else. several  years and some 10,000 shots later, it's still going strong. I saved my money until I could afford this fantastic camera and have been happy with it ever since.

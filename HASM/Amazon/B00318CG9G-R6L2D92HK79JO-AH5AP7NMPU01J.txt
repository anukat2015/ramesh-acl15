Title: My favorite computer
Content:
There are a lot of reviews with the technical information that describes this computer. Since, I am not so good with the technical aspect, I will just tell you that I am fairly computer illiterate, but was able to set this one up,connect it to the router and have it running in 15 minutes. It is the easiest thing to use and I'm pleased with the functions that it performs. I'm still learning something new everyday that amazes me, so yes, I would buy it again. The only thing I don't like is that HP offers free games and you get used to doing one and all of a sudden, they want you to buy "Wild Coins" to continue playing. They can forget that, I'll buy the game I really like before I do that and I can find free ones at other places.

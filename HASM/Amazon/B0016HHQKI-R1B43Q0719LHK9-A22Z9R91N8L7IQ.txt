Title: Beauty Is in the Eye of the Beholder
Content:
Let me begin by saying I cannot tell you this has lasted umpteen years for me.  I only can vouch for daily usage for a month.  It has been great so far.
If you're into design over function, you might want a prettier model.  This looks boxy; but it is very functional and protects its pot nicely.  The top opening puts the filler and the #4 filter right there in front, handy.  The next pleasant surprise is that the pot pours without spilling all over.  In fact, I've never seen any pitcher-type device pour better.  I didn't realize how much I've suffered over the years.
I'm also sorry to use "pot."  Wasn't sure how to spell carafe.  I can be fancy when I want to; but right now, we're talking about coffee, not flavored stuff.
I'll let the tech folks explain why the "showerhead" on-off drizzle and the "aroma" button work; but they do.  My first pot of coffee was surpringly better tasting than my old Braun.  Same coffee.  It does take longer, as has been mentioned; but sometimes good things do take longer, don't they?
A brief summary?  OK, it's not pretty; but it looks like a permanent fixture in your kitchen -- it's solid.  It is designed for easy preparation and it pours good.... well. 
The coffee from it tastes good, assuming you use good-tasting coffee in the first place.  It'll make the most out of what you put in it, I guess.
And it holds 14 cups (relative cups, not 14x8 ounces).  I start with hot, black, and go to iced coffee during the day.  This works great, just for me.  Ignore the company you may have.
Another thought I had when I pulled it out of the box?  This would be great if we had a little store or shoppe and wanted coffee for customers.

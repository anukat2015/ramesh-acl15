Title: Nice when it doesn't leak
Content:
I love the concept of this machine- my husband and I were looking forward to using this because we are big coffee drinkers in the morning.  First, if you put too much coffee in the basket, it clogs and will leak the coffee everywhere.  We like our coffee strong so it's been a drawback because you can't fill it with the 3-4 tablespoons of coffee recommended per cup.  Second, if you grind the coffee too fine the water gets clogged and will leak everywhere.  However, we worked out those quirks and can brew our coffee to go but I wish it was a little more sturdy.

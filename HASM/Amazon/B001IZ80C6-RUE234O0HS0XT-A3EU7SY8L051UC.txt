Title: Even a kid can pour
Content:
We like this model because we are lazy and always asking our kids to pour us a refill.  This way they don't have to pick up a glass carafe and pour and put back on a burner.  Also, it doesn't have that "sat on the burner too long" taste to it.  When filling the reservoir, we use tap water from the sink via the squirter, right into the little hole.  Clearly, we are not coffee purists, but it tastes like a good cup to us.

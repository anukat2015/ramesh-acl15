Title: Great laptop
Content:
The description says it all. I can add to it that 2.25 hrs of battery life is what one gets with default settings; I decreased screen brightness a bit from the default value (to me, it was much too bright) and the battery life immediately went into the range of 3+ hours. I wish the screen was a little higher (it is wide all right, but a bit short) and I wish there was one more USB port. But I guess one can never have too much of a good thing. The machine is very, very quiet, does not heat up much (my old HP laptop would heat up and make noise on same actions I do now). Spacious hard drive (500 GB) gives you a lot of freedom to install all your stuff and carry it around with you without having to think "what can I delete if I want to install this new thing?" The keyboard is very smooth and the extra numerical pad is helpful. I've looked through quite a few computers before I picked this one. Just before I was going to get an HP model, but 3 HP reps over 48 hours failed to take my money which I was trying to pay them, until I realized that HP must've been a wrong choice on my part. I found this Toshiba then and am very happy with it, it was cheaper than HP and most of key characteristics were the same or better. It's been about a month since I've owned it and so far I'm very happy.

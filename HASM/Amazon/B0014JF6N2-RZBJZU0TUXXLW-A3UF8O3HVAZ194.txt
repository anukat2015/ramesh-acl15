Title: Good to the last drop!
Content:
I wanted to let everyone know that this is one of the best coffee makers I have ever owned. As long as you preheat the coffee thermos coffee can last as long as 4 hours. Just a note that it takes a bit of time to learn how to pour the coffee out of the thermos. It is also good to shake it up before you pour. I was able to get the rebuilt coffee pot at a very good price. I can say this coffee pot was a great deal!

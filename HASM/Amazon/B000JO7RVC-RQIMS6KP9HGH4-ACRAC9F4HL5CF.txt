Title: Chip Off the Old Block
Content:
The 6th generation is a very nicely improved version of the 80 gb classic iPod. It is quite a bit thinner than the 2-year old unit I am replacing. The graphics are improved in various ways, such as you see the album covers while tunes are playing. The sound and the earbuds seem to be the same as on my earlier unit, though, no improvements noticeable in those. The one mistake I made was in buying an iSkin cover... it was sized for the older generation and this one rattles around in it... to big. So if you buy an iSkin, be sure you get one sized for the 6th generation.

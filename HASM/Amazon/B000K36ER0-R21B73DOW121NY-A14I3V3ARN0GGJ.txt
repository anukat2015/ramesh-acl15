Title: Love it!
Content:
I've only had this coffee maker 2 weeks but it's wonderful so far.
Love the beep when it's ready and when it shuts off.  Love that I can turn off the beep if I want to.  Love the display that shows how long the coffee's been sitting on the burner.  Love the clear water guide.  Love that the basket doesn't drip onto the burner when you remove the carafe.  Love that the carafe pours without dripping.  Most of all, love the shiny red color!
Only one tiny complaint - even with the adjustable warming plate cranked up high, my husband thinks it's not hot enough.  I think it's fine.

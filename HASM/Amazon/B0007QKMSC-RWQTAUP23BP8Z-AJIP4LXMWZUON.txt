Title: Great Specs, but too small
Content:
This is a really nice Digital SLR, but if you are upgrading from the original Digital Rebel be warned that this is a MUCH smaller body.  It does not have the same high quality feel as the first and it is actually pretty hard to use if you have large hands.  To me it is almost worth paying the $450 more for the 20d just to get the larger body.

Title: Can be annoyingly glitchy, but still the best game in town
Content:
My 2ndGen 4Gb Nano has been glitchy from the day I bought it.  I have a list of things that were odd, frustrating or annoying but for times sake, I will say that it frequently freezes up forcing me to reset it; it sometimes locks itself [the lock icon is on the screen but the hold button is not in the hold position] forcing me to reset it; if it gets cold, the battery dies very quickly; the spin dial for volume and selection is so sensitive that I often have to make several attempts to adjust anything without over- or under-shooting the menu (or volume) I want.
All this said, it still sets the standard for MP3 listening, beats any known cellphone option for listening to music, and is quickly becoming a part of the fabric of our culture, as the cellphone did 10 years ago.
PROs: Sleek, lightweight, innovative design and technology
CONs: Can be glitchy but once you accept that, very easy/simple to use.

Title: Great vacuum until you try and get repaired under warranty
Content:
I have had this vacuum for about 8 mos.  It is quiet, cleans and filters well and is relatively easy to move around.  I am pretty happy with it from that standpoint, however, there is no doubt that the quality of the product is not the Electrolux of old.  Within a month of buying a small plastic piece which connected the power nozzle broke.  I live in a large metropolitan area and thought it would be easy to address under warranty.  No such luck.  Could only find one warranty repair shop within 50 miles and they had a 3 to 4 month backlog.  All the shops that used to do Electrolux warranty repair work had stopped as they said the new owner of the brand was too hard to deal with.  Ended up paying out of pocket to get the new part delivered to a vaccum repair shop and after 4 tries at shipping the correct part I finally got the right part and got the vacuum fixed.  Was without vacuum for 2 months and out $80.  Not sure I would buy again in the future unless they fix the repair and support network.

Title: Yes it picks up dog hair but...
Content:
I bought this vacuum in spite of the fact that I really didn't want another bagless unit.  But in the store it seemed like this one would be easier to dump out than the dirt devil I have, so I thought I'd give it a shot.
1) It's heavy, but I didn't have trouble putting it together like some other folks did.
2) It did pick up copious amounts of dirt, and worked pretty well on carpet, hardwood and my area rugs.
3) I liked how easy it was to switch from vacuum to hand tools.
4) It was nasty to clean out.  The bin is easy to remove, but it fills up pretty quickly, and all kinds of stuff gets stuck up in the upper part of the bin where the filter is.  The only way to get it out was to stick my hand up there and pull it out.  NOT what I had in mind.
5) The belt broke during the third use.
So I was willing to live with the nasty clean-up - hoping that if I used this unit regularly, the clean-up would become less heinous.  But having the belt break so quickly was unacceptable.  The vacuum went back and i plan to buy a nice upright with a bag as I had originally intended.  
Maybe I'll even spring for an auto-rewind cord - since the only thing I hate as much as emptying a filthy canister is rewinding the darn cord.

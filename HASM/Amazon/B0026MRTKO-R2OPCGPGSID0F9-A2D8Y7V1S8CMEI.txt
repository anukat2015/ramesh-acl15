Title: Save your money for a better product.
Content:
I wish I had just saved the money toward a better quality item, you get what you pay for.  I purchased 2 of these for my children for Christmas.
Both items were unfunctional within a month.  The touch screen was cheap and very difficult to use, you really had to press hard to get response, and using more pressure appears to have damaged the item to some extent.
It was hard to navigate and figure out where files were stored, and how to get music files to play in playlists. Very un-user friendly interface and very little by way of instructions on how to use it.
I am looking into sending both back for refunds. We only loaded 2 CDs worth of music to each, and both have died and will not come away from the "please wait" screen when trying to turn it on.

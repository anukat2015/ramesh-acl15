Title: 5th generation iPod Nano
Content:
Wonderful features! The only problem I've had is being able to consistently get the FM station favorites feature to work. It's a very minor thing. It would be nice, however, if there were a more comprehensive manual, either sold with the product or available as a PDF file for free online to allow one to better understand and operate the Nano's features.

Title: rip off
Content:
Just to let anyony know for 50$ less than the ipod you can get a 40 gig Creative ZEN xtra , creative makes sound cards for a living, and the sonund is amaizing, i have both the ipod and the zen, audio clartiy and quality is much higher on the zen.  I also like the fact the creative isnt controlling and picky about where you get your music from, my ipod is gathering dust.

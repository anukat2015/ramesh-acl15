Title: Economical and works well...and quietly
Content:
Once you've adjusted the temperature to your liking, it works like a charm.  So quiet and discreet, you'll forget it's on, until you realize you're comfortable in short sleeves when it's in the 30s outside.  For the price, a very good radiator.  Very pleased, and am considering buying another one for the (currently unheated) sunroom.

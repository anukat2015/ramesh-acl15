Title: This product meets all expectations!!
Content:
We heat our house with propane fireplace inserts, one each upstairs and downstairs.  However, we wanted additional heaters for our back bedrooms during those near-zero or sub-zero winter days and nights, heaters that would be economical and add visual warmth to those rooms. The Dimplex CS1205 is perfect.  What is really interesting is to see the household pets lying in front of these heaters just like they do in front of the fireplaces.  And, the fire simulation is remarkable --- could not ask for better.  We also purchased the WIN100 thermostats to use with these heaters thanks to the review written by another Dimplex owner.  These thermostats are a good match, and they are affordable when purchased through Amazon.

Title: The perfect step up from a Rebel
Content:
I read everything I could get my hands on, and debated long and hard, when I knew I wanted to move up from my Rebel Xsi.  I knew I wanted a Canon - to be able to use my existing EOS lenses - and narrowed my choice down between the 50D and the 7D.  I could not be happier with my decision to go with the 7D.  I am sorry to say, but shooting with this (compared to the Rebel Xsi) was like night and day difference.  From the moment you press the shutter button, you know you are in a different league of equipment.
Things I love:
-- 19-pt focussing, along with the five AF selection modes (Single-point AF, Zone AF, Auto select 19-pt AF, spot AF and Manual AF point expansion) - easy to select, indispensable while shooting. 
-- Significant increase in accuracy in metering technology
-- Easy to create customized functions (exposure, autofocus/drive, operation, etc.) and custom Picture Styles
-- Love the Quick Control screen and ergonomics of multi-controller, Quick Control dial, and Main Dial ... easy learning curve to quickly navigate and change settings.
There are so many features and settings  to this camera that I have found to be easy to access, easy to use, easy to adjust - Canon did a spectacular job in design.  I have not used the Movie Mode for recording video; just not my thing.  But for still photography, I am so impressed with everything about this camera - it has made a huge difference in my results, everything from focussing and exposure accuracy to final image quality with the high megapixels.  A book I would recommend highly to help anyone get acquainted with the operation and features of the 7D (very well illustrated and written) is the Canon EOS 7D Digital Field Guide by Charlotte Lowrie.

Title: More for Your Money
Content:
With a 600MHz G3 (approx. 1.2 GHz pentium) and 128 MB RAM, this little computer is a deceptive powerhouse. Portability, durability, and ease of use are the traditional accolades for Mac laptops, but this one is the first to pack real value. The new operating system, the faster chip, and the added storage space make the iBook a perfect investment for college students or business people on the go. With a DVD player, iMovie to edit digital movies, iTunes to manage MP3 files, Palm software built in, and free word processing software all included, the iBook is ready to become the hub of your digital lifestyle.

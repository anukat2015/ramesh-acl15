Title: Good Choice, But ...
Content:
I agree with most reviews I've read about this coffee maker, including the critical ones.  I bought this even after reading those reviews.
I wish the water level meter was visible from the outside - the step ladder is very hard to see. The unit is indeed a pain to clean. Just putting the various parts in the dishwasher means you spend time taking the unit apart, and then putting it back together later.  It does not need cleaning every time however.
What I have not seen mentioned is something I consider to be a design flaw:  steam from the brewing basket (and the carafe) seeps up into the grinding area.  It is this moisture that can create a gooey mess up there.
My solution?  When brewing is done - pop the top and open the grinder lid.  This dries it out and really reduces the number of times the unit needs cleaning.  Unfortunately, this isn't all that cool looking - especially for a unit that's at least half about appearance.
The coffee is great and I am happier with this unit then my previous drip coffee maker.  
For the price - I should probably be even happier though.

Title: Put the Money towards something else...
Content:
My boyfriend owns this vacuum & since he doesn't clean I am forced to.  I am not a fan of canister vacuums anyways - but this one is horrible. 
I try to always start out with the positives:
1) Color is nice.
2) I do like the cord retraction - makes it easy to keep the cord out of the way
Negatives:
1) The cover over the light on top of the vacuum brush pops off constantly
2) The hose gets wrapped and tangled every time I use it
3) the canister hits corners of the walls when you go from room to room - causing dents and scratches on the dry wall
After using this item i was reassured that I do not like Canister Vacuums. For the money you are paying I would recommend to anyone to really research an upright that fits your needs. However, if tangled cords, dented dry wall, and busted pieces is what you want to spend your dollar on then this is the product for you.

Title: I love My Zunes
Content:
I bought myself a 30 gb Zune about 2 years ago and it has been one of the best devices I have ever purchased.  So for my moms birthday I purchased her this 4gb pink Zune and she LOVES it...no matter what she is doing she has got at least 1 head phone in and jamming out to her tunes.  This Zune is a great tiny size, has a great screen and easy enough for my mom to use with out any problems...I would recommend any Zune to anyone looking for a great mp3 player...They are better then Ipods and way under raided.

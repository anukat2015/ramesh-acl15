Title: Good Value
Content:
My HP died, found out that the HP DV2000 which I had was defective, problems with the motherboard would show up after 2-3 years of use. HP was aware of the problem and would fix it for me for $400 + shipping (my warrenty was up). Decided it was better to get a new laptop. Never again an HP! The Geek at Best Buy told me this was the laptop he bought, made by IBM and very dependable. He did not steer me wrong as far as I could tell. It takes a little getting used to Windows 7, I had Vista previously and XP on a desktop. But everything with this machine was easy, set up to internet, program installation etc. And it is fast!! Yes it is slow to start but that is Windows 7, Vista was slow also. Have the same stuff on this computer as my old HP and I still have tons of space on the hard drive. So far I am very happy. The think pad tools icon also is a help. I trust computer geeks when it comes to this sort of thing, he did not try to get me to buy a $1200.00 machine, this was half the price and it feels great.

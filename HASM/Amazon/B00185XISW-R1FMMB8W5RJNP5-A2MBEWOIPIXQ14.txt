Title: Unfortunately, not safe
Content:
I was so happy with my first Eco-Heater that I soon bought a second one. Then one of them developed a self-caused burn mark. I contacted the company, which promptly replaced it. I was so happy with the service that I bought another one (I have solar panels so my electricity is virtually free while my gas heating system is quite costly). So now I have three. Unfortunately, one of them is no longer usable because I fear the burnt-wire smell it gives out (although I don't see any traces of the problem). The second one makes a big scary spark when I turn it off. The third one still works well under my desk to keep my legs warm while I work. I really love the Eco-Heater, I'll most certainly try it again but for now I don't find it safe to use unless I'm in the room with it.

Title: Fairly Loud
Content:
We bought ours at a big box wholesaler in Dallas and I was surprised how loud it is in our small sunroom. It is noisier than our Samsung 6300 BTU window unit in a utility room. My wife could not hear me 10 feet away just outside the sunroom. Today it's 98 with 28% humidity; I'll follow up a internal temp report when I get home.

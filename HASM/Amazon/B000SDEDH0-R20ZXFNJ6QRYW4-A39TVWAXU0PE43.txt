Title: STOP! Don't buy this unit!
Content:
Worst buying decision I ever made! This unit when it works is great but it died after 5 weeks of limited use. Amazon refused to do anything to help me so I had to deal direct with the mfg. in California. They made me ship it back to them at MY expense and that cost me $139.43! It took them 2 months to ship me a new unit and when they did I found out that it was an earlier version
of the unit I returned! No way to shut off the drain and water just pours out if you mistakenly use it on dehumidifify. The version I bought had a valve on the drain and you could pick and choose when to empty the drain. When I purchased Amazon website said "local service" BALONEY! Since when is spending $139.43 to send a unit 1200 miles considered local service?
BUYER BEWARE of this unit and in buying something that is drop shipped halfway across the country because the MFG has not set up local service which I beleive is a violation of Washington State law!
I am now involved in a consumer affairs complaint and plan to sue Amazon in small claims court to get all my money back!

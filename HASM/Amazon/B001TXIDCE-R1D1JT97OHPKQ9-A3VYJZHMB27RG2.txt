Title: Great first DSLR
Content:
Let me start by saying this is my third Olympus SLR, my first DSLR and my seventh Olympus overall. Each camera gets better and better. I appreciate that Olympus incorporates thinking person's features into thier firmware and design. The e620 is no different. I get really sharp photographs with little to no effort, it is easy enough for my six year old to use. (not going to make that a regular habit) It performed very well during my son's baseball games and my duaghter's football games. I have some wonderful portraits of my children and my very lazy dog. The camera is extremely comfortable to hold and use, I can download my photos to any computer with little to no problem regardless of operating system. And while granted I am still working some exposure issues that will resolve themselves after continued use, I feel that it was a worthwhile purchase and I am looking forward to many years with this camera and fall colors commencing next month. I purchased this camera and the 12-60 lens to accompany it, mainly because of the speed of the lens and the camera itself, and I really did not like the kit lens. I am not going to say buy this camera, but based on my experiences, thirty years of 35mm and medium format photography, this camera feels just right.

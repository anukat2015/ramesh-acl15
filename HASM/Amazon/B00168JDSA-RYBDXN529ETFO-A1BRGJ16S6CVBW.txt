Title: Portable A/C Unit
Content:
The A/C unit puts out a tremendous amount of cool air and works as advertised. Previous reviews mentioned that it was noisy and that is indeed the case. However, that is a small price to pay after a hurricane has knocked out our power, the generator has been turned on, and it's a humid 95 degrees out without a breath of wind. The price was right, too. I'm very pleased with the purchase. Setup is easy and the manufacturer quickly replaced a minor plastic part that got broken during shipping.

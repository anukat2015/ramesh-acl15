Title: Beware of the hidden cost of this heater
Content:
I bought two of these heaters at Costco for about $[...] each. I was hoping that I could heat the two rooms we spend the most time in more efficiently and effectively rather than using our whole-house forced-air furnace. So, I turned off my furnace and used only the space heaters. This was such a big mistake as I discovered when, after using the heaters for a month, I got my first PG&E (our gas and electric utility company) bill. My bill, which normally runs about $450/month in the winter went up to $825! When I called PG&E to see what could have caused our bill to almost double, they asked me if we were using electric room-size heaters. I said yes and they told me that the space heaters were the reason. They are not cost-effective and since they are electric, cost much more to operate than running our gas furnace. Upon hearing this, I immediately returned the space heaters to Costco. Fortunately, Costco has a fantastic return policy, and I was able to get a full refund. The clencher is, the first sentence in Amazon's product description for this item starts with, "A great money-saving alternative to heating the entire home..." Beware of using these heaters as a replacement for whole-house gas furnaces. They do a great job warming large rooms I will admit, but at a high price. If you do decide to get one, use it very sparingly or you will be sorry when your electric bill arrives. Live and learn.

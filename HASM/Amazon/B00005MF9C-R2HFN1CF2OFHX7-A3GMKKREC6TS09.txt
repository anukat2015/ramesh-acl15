Title: Suitable for single cup.
Content:
Few weeks since I started using the coffeemaker. 
Pros: no waste if you want just a cup of coffee; easy to measure; ideal for quick cup of coffee; affordable (I paid less than $13)
Cons: coffee is not hot, I usually put little ice at my starbucks coffee but still the one that I prepare using coffee maker is not warm for me; The water container is not easily accessible. 
Summary: If you like your coffee HOT, this is not for you. But if you don't mind drinking only warm coffee, well this will be a perfect one for a single cup. It doesn't take space on your kitchen, easy to clean too.

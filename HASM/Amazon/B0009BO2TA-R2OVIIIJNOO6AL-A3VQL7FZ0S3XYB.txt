Title: Good but not excellent
Content:
I have to agree with others on this product.  The wand parts do not stay together and frankly, this is much more than annoying.  Had I known about this problem, I would have purchased something else.  It's a good little vac for light use, which is all I need with hardwood and stained/scored concrete, but one cannot efficiently use it (i.e. inefficient because you are constantly having to chase the part that fell off and interrupt the flow of work).  Without this design flaw, I would have rated it a 5, but with this design flaw, I am stretching to rate it a 3.

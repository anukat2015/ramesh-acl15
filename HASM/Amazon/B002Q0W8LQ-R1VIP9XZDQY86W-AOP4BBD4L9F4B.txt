Title: Excellent computer, excellent price, HP DV6-1361SB
Content:
When I saw this model available, I decide to buy it immediately! Excellent graphic card (GPU) Ati, enough memory 4 Gigs in DDR3, great CPU C2D 2.53 GHz same of the Macbook Pro, Seagate Hard Drive (7200 rpm which is weir in a laptop), Windows 7 Pro 64 Bits runs everything fast.
I love to play with HD Video (H.264, VC-1, etc), this computer can handle them using a very low CPU percentage, for example I can see a video 1920x1080 with 20 MBPS of bit rate in Windows Media Player and the CPU is usage is of around 20%.
The fingerprint reader simplified that way to log in to my computer a lots.
Very soon I am going to install some PC Games, I am sure this computer can handle then.
Anyway I definitely, recommend this computer.
Thanks.

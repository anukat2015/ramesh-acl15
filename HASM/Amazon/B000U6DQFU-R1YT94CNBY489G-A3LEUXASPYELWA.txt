Title: Great for its intended purpose
Content:
This product will not replace your broom or your regular vacuum.  But that is not its intended purpose.  I purchased this vacuum to suck up dog hair tumbleweeds that form on my hardwood floors.   It does that without any difficulty and the vacuum has also impressed me with its ability to clean up other debis that is tracked into the house from outside.  
It's not a full power vacuum and don't expect it to be.  But it does not have any problem picking up loose dirt, debis or pet hair off of the floor or other surfaces.

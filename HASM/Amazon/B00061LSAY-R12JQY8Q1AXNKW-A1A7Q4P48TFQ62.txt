Title: Best dSLR within the Budget
Content:
This camera is a perfect choice for people who sincerely want a REAL camera.  Nikon D70 is another one if you don't mind its bulkier size. 
With this Pentax, you will get not only absolutely-beautifully-textured black metal body as Nikon but also a very big and very clear penta-prism (not mirror as in others) viewfinder.  Plus, you can always pop into a gas station to get four AA batteries in a pinch.  Its pictures in JPEG might not be as sharp as ones from Rebel.  What's the heck? For family photos, I use zoom lenses and don't even shoot in the best quality JPEG anyway.  If I really care about the image quality, I can always put on my 50mm and shoot in RAW, whose quality is as good as Rebel.   
Canon Rebel and XT are really plastic toys that happen to be able to take very good pictures.  Even my son's Nintendo GB feels more substantial than a Rebel!  Unlike an owner of Rebel, whenever you see a real camera from the same manufacturer, such as Rebel's bigger brothers, you won't curse yourself for being a few hundred bucks short and treated as a second-class customer by the manufacturer.
Maybe I have been too harsh on Canon.  I guess the concept behind Rebels is not really camera per se.  They mean not to be really a serious photographic tool, rather another piece of consumer electronics---in fashion and easily disposable.  If consumers are going to buy into their next generation next year, what's a point to make it to last?  I must say Canon did a truly very laudable job to execute this concept.

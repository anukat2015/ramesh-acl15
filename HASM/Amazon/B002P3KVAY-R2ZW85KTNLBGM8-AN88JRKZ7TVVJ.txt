Title: Fast netbook, well balanced and great price for the money
Content:
I got the 1.3GHz Celeron CULV version, with the following specs:
- 1.3GHz single core Celeron CULV processor
- 11.6" 1366x768 screen, LED backlit
- Built-in Intel 4500MHD graphics accelerator
- 2GB RAM
- 250GB SATA hard drive (it's a Western Digital Scorpio Blue drive)
- Wifi 802.11b/g/n
- Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit
I had a previous model Acer Aspire One 8.9", and really needed more screen space. I wanted a netbook, without an Atom processor (the Atom is way too slow at least for my tastes), and that had a 1366x768 screen. This netbook had all the specs I wanted. 
Thinking that 1.3GHz would be underpowered, I played with it for almost an hour in the store before actually buying it. It was really impressive that it actually performed faster than any other 1.6GHz Atom netbook I compared it to. I can play youtube videos full screen, although when switching to HD mode, it stuttered a bit.
Windows 7 on this machine is really a pleasure to use. For the minimal tasks it's used for (Skype, Web Browsing, Office 2007, Youtube/Hulu videos) it has very, very acceptable performance. I think it is due to the fast hard drive it included, a 5400 rpm Western Digital Scorpio Blue (WD2500BEVT), which are known to be great laptop drives.
The screen is very good, bright and easy on the eyes. I don't think a resolution less than 1366x768 would be acceptable for any netbook. Great improvement in terms of available desktop space compared to my smaller 8.9" netbook.
In terms of battery life, upon doing the tasks I previously mentioned, with mostly web browsing and with the screen set at full brightness, it can do around 5 hours of use. Compared to my Aspire One's 1 and a half hours of battery life, this is a massive improvement.
Very satisfied with Acer netbooks, they always deliver a great user experience, along with a great price.

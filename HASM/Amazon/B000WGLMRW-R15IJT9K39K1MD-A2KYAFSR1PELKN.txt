Title: perfect if you're the only coffee drinker in the family
Content:
I first used the Hamilton Beach 4-cup model in a hotel room.  It was small, simple, fast, and made piping hot and delicious coffee.  For years, I have used a French press for my coffee at home, because I am the only coffee drinker in my house.  Even with a double-walled French press, the coffee is cold before I am finshed.  (I have a full-size drip machine with a thermal carafe for parties, but it is too big one person.)
So, I decided I would buy something like this for myself, and was delighted to find the exact model from my hotel room, because I already knew I would like it.  I am very pleased with this machine.  One commenter mentioned a drip when swinging out the basket to remove the grounds.  Yes, this happens, but I am usually cleaning up when I do that and have a dish cloth with me anyway.
If you order this machine, you may also want to order the junior (4-cup) coffee filters, because that size isn't commonly stocked in supermarkets.

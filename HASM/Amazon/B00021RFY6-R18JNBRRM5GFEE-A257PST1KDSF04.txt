Title: Cuisinart stands behind their product!!  Not that they need to......its terrific!
Content:
We have had the older style of this model since about 2000, it makes the best pot of coffee I have ever tasted. Yes the grinder is loud but you do drink coffee to wake up right?  We just rinse the parts with warm water and sit them out to dry everyday, put it in the dishwasher once a week. It is also nice to wipe it out every few days as excess grinds can accumulate in certain areas. 
Wonder why there are so many refurbished units?  Well I can tell you that Cuisinart has replaced ours TWICE since we've owned it!!  Once it stopped grinding and another time it just stopped working. $10 in postage and we had a brand new one in a few weeks, the hardest part was not having the delicious coffee while a new one was on the way. My inlaws have this new design and they don't have any problems with it either. Our older style will not run if all the parts aren't in place correctly, I can't imagine the newer design not having this feature also. 
I suggest if one has problems operating this unit that one probably struggles through daily life also.....

Title: I resisted Zogirushi, at first, but gratefully relented. To boot, it is a green-machine!
Content:
I love this coffee maker. I have been throwing out burnt coffee, for a long time. When I visited my aunt, she had a coffee maker with a thermal carafe. I began shopping. Snob that I am, I began my search with the brands I 'knew' were good; Braun, Krupps, Cuisinart. Based on recommendations, I bought the Cuisinart.  When I went for a cup, about an hour after brewing it, the coffee was cold.  I sent it back.  I resisted Zogirushi, because I had never heard of the brand. I tried another top name brand, and was again unsatisfied. (One might wonder why I didn't merely get the brand my aunt has: no longer available.)
So, I surrendered to the Zogirushi. I was eager to try it, as soon as it arrived, due to all the positive reviews, both on Amazon AND Consumer Reports. I opened it up, and began cleaning the parts.......but, I couldn't get the screw cap off!  Curious and open-minded, I spent around 20 minutes variably trying to open it or figure out how if that was supposed to be that way, to use it.  I finally decided that if I WAS supposed to use it without taking off the cap, then I didn't want it -- how could you clean it?!?!
Against my need for immediate gratification, I returned the coffee maker, but decided to give it one more chance.  I am so glad I did. This coffee maker makes wonderful coffee, wetting the grounds just enough;  it takes up less room on my counter than any other I have used (Cuisinart, Krupps, Braun, Melitta, etc);  the only heating element is that used to heat the water;  it shuts off automatically after the coffee is brewed; AND THE COFFEE IS STILL STEAMY AFTER 2 HOURS!!!  I love this coffee maker!

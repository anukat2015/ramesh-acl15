Title: Style Over Function
Content:
I have to weigh on the ongoing debate whether this device is a loud as a hair dryer or not.  My vote:  It is definitely as loud as a hair dryer.  Actually, it is possibly louder than a hair dryer, because my unit (which sits on a hardwood floor) shakes the floor slightly when it is running, filling the room with a low-pitched booming noise, in addition to the din of the fan itself.   
I purchased this heater because I have owned a DeLonghi oil-filled radiator for years which has given excellent service.  Unfortunately, this new DeLonghi fan heater has been a disappointment.  It does look nice, and it has a remote control.  It puts out plenty of heat, so that's good.
The downsides:  there is the noise factor.  And the shaking, although you might not notice that if you had carpeting.  (I put it on a towel.)  It also makes loud and pointless beeping noises whenever you press a button or move it.  Finally, even after a year of use, it emits out a toxic chemical smell for the first minute or two after it is turned on.
It's not cheap.  There must be better choices out there if you want a fan heater.

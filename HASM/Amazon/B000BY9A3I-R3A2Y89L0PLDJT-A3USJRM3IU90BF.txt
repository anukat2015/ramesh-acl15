Title: Great Vacuum!
Content:
I am very pleased with the Dirt Devil Vision. I have hardwood floors in my apartment and two cats, and this vacuum gets rid of cat hair very well without scratching the floor. It is easy to handle and I like the convenience of the canister style, as it reaches under beds and dressers, and the attachments are great for rugs and upholstery. There were no surprises when I got the product, as it is accurately described online. The suction is good, however if you intend to use this for carpet and not hardwood floors, you might be disappointed as the suction is great for bare floors, but not as good for carpets. 
Overall, this is a great vacuum and I recommend it highly.

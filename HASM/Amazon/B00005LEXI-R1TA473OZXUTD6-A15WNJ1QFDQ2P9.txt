Title: Portable Heat
Content:
I use this in a hunting blind as well as camping.  Its great for quick heat.  Used it in 25 degree weather in a tent.  In about a minute the unit had to be turned down and turned off in 5 minutes due to the heat.  I'm not sure if I trust the low oxygen sensor so I would leave a window open in what every you use it in.  The unit does not have an internal fan.  I have owned this for about 6 months.  I purchased the refurb with no problems.  Best part is the low odor or none.  Highly recommend for those power outage locations.

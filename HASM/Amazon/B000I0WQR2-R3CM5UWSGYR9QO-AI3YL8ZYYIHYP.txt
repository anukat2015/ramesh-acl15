Title: Perfect Space Heater
Content:
This is exactly what I was looking for in a space heater.  It's silent, you'd have to try to burn yourself on it (i.e., merely touching it won't hurt), and it really heats up a room impressively well.  We have very high ceilings, and that posed no challenge to this thing.  
I would note that the safety auto-shutoff is a failsafe, not a timer.  The heater will shut itself off if it's overheating.  It doesn't have a feature that will turn it off after a certain number of hours.

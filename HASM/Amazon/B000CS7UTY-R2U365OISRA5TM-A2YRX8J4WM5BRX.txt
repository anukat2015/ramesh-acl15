Title: Blows Apple Away!
Content:
I work in the electronics field and have seen many MP-3 players in recent years. Hands down this is the best video / MP-3 player out to date. It's well built feels good in your hand and does just about anything you want it to. The videos play on a 42 inch tv as clear as they do on the player. I transfer videos from my pc onto it and then play them on my tv or bring them to friends and famlies homes to watch. It's like having a mini vcr with you. Sound quality is second to none. FM Tuner is just another plus that Apple doesn't have. Apple has always wanted to own a particular market, That's why they lost the PC fight in the 1980's. It seems they never learned there lesson. I never liked apple because of it's licensing of content that has to be loaded into it. We all download Music from different sources and with apple only it's I-Tunes music works. With other players including creatives any music on your pc can be loaded and played. Apple seems to want to place a noose on it's owners necks.
Bottom line this player not only looks as nice as the Ipod but performs better with no restrictions on what it plays.
No brainer, Creative Zen : M is the winner in my opinion.

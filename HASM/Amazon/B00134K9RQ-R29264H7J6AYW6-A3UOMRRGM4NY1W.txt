Title: Good Little Heater Holmes Model # HFH442
Content:
In Michigan, I use this heater during the fall and winter months to blast a bit of heat into a 6X7 bathroom in those wee hours when the temp in the house is btw 66 & 68 degrees.  It warms the air rapidly and quickly mitigates the cold chill.
This lightweight heater is easily transported and has an easy hand grip on top.  This will be my third winter with it.  I use it daily up to 4 hours.
The noise of the unit can get to you if you have it on while reading or relaxing.  I have forgotten about it and the unit, coming on at night, has awakened me.
I have also used it to warm a 14X12 space, but there are other units better suited to warm larger spaces that won't dry out the air.  Like the Holmes HQH308 or the Delonghi EW750L.
I purchased this unit off season -so I got an extraordinary deal- another reason I like it so much.
I also have the Holmes HFH2986-U Whisper Quiet Power Heater. The thermostat has never worked on the unit -only the continuous HI / LO setting.  I don't like this as well.  This unit is cumbersome, fat and not easy to grip to pick up and transport to another space.  
I would recommend the Holmes HFH442 if needed to quickly heat small areas quickly.

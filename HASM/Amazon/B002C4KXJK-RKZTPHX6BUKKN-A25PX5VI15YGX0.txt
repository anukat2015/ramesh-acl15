Title: A Great Choice
Content:
If I just won the lottery I would have bought a Macbook Air. Since I did not buy a ticket-and therefore did not win-I bought this computer. It is on sale at J&R Music World for $379.
Light weight, great size screen=very clear-very comfortable to use-as quick as I need it to be to do Word and Surfing-the perfect netbook. Beware-the battery is only a 4 cell which can mean less time between re-charges. I only had it a week so I don't know how long the batter lasts. 
Only downside-it uses Windows-What can you do?
I am very happy with it but would suggest you buy it at J&R where it is much less money.

Title: That'll Do
Content:
I live in one of those poorly insulated San Diego apartments where its always colder in the house than outside in the winter, and always warmer inside than outside in the summer.  After the extreme chill (yeah its southern CA, I know) in December I decided to get a space heater, but didn't want some cheapo looking plastic-y one and saw this on an Amazon search.  I immediately thought it would be a good fit in my place.  I ended up buying it and I really like it.  It takes a little while to heat up my living room, although its not very large, its just that I keep this in a certain spot in a corner, and that could have something to do with poor window insulation.  
What I really like about it is that it doesn't look cheesy, that was my main concern in buying one.  Everyone that has come over and seen it has commented on how cool it looks.  My cat really likes to stare at it as well, but she's easily entertained.  For the time being this has satisfied my desire for a fireplace, and warmed up my house a bit.  It doesn't heat up any adjoining room though, I know one reviewer mentioned that.  I have this placed in a small corner that it next to my bedroom door, but faces my living room.  Maybe the unit I got isn't blowing out as much warm air as it should.  
The unit is pretty light and easy to move around.  The surrounding unit doesn't get hot, which is very nice, I don't want my cat to burn her face off or something.

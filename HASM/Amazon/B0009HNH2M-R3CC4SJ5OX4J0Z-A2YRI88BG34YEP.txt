Title: Good Vacuum
Content:
I bought a refurbished Hoover Duros about a year ago, and have been very satisfied with it. It cleans carpet well, and I can turn off the brush to actually clean hard floors instead of tossing the bits around to find later. When a portion of the wand is removed, it is conveniently sized to vacuum carpeted stairs. I also like that I can adjust the suction for more powerful (spilled beads) or less powerful (every vacuum cleaner I have had before tried to eat throw rugs) cleaning.
I have found it a sturdy and reliable product. The filter bags are great, especially for my roommate who has strong allergies. I only wish the bags were available at the usual local places instead of by internet/special order.
I ordered through GoVaccum; shipping was prompt, terms were clear, and I received a great vacuum at a reasonable and affordable price.

Title: Get a Creative, much easier to use
Content:
I purchased the ipod nano this weekend at Best Buy. My reasons for buying it were mainly cosmetic: I liked the color and there are a lot of different accessories you can purchase for it. I got the nano home and installed itunes, THEN found out that you have to keep your entire music collection on your computer, so that the next time you plug the ipod into the computer, you don't lose your music on the player. First bad thing. I had transferred music from my old player onto my computer in order to transfer it onto the nano, but was up until 1 30 in the morning figuring this out, because the instruction that come with the nano are very limited. Second bad thing. The next morning I wanted to copy some cds onto my computer so I could put them onto the nano, but when I plugged the nano in, nothing would register as being plugged in. That was the last straw. I took the nano back and got a Creative Zen V Plus instead.
The nano just isn't worth it. The Creative Zen V Plus has the same amount of storage, yet holds 2000 songs, as opposed to the nano which only holds 1000, and even then it doesn't really hold that amount. The Creative plays video clips, whereas the nano does not. And the Creative was $20 less than the nano.
Bypass the ipod and go straight for the creative...you won't regret it.

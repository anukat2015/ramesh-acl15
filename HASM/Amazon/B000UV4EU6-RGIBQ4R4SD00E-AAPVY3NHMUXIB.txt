Title: Very buggy and not intuitive
Content:
I've had Creative flash mp3 players for years and found them to be very reliable and simple to use.  I wanted more capacity so I bought this one.  I was very disappointed in this mp3 player and returned it after a week or so.  It was very buggy--always just shutting off for no apparent reason and requiring me to reset it.  Also, I found the whole interface to be annoying and difficult to use.  It is especially annoying that one can't just adjust the volume--you have to scroll through a bunch of menus.  Bottom line: it just never worked right, and when it did it was buggy and/or confusing to use.

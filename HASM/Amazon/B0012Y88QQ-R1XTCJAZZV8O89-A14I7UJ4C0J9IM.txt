Title: best bang for the buck IMHO
Content:
IMHO this is probably the best bang-for-the-buck consumer grade DSLR.  Some folks complain about the image quality, but there are plenty of articles on the Internet telling you why looking at a digital photo at 100% zoom is not a sensible thing to do.
Compare to XS, this one gives you 2M more pixels, 2 more AF points, and an insignificantly faster drive speed (3.5fps vs 3).  If you don't think of these as important, then you should go with an XS to save about $100.
T1i is more expensive, and for the extra $200, it gives you 3M more pixels, 3 higher ISO settings, video capture feature, but an even-more-insignificantly slower drive speed.  If you have the money, go for it.  but for me, I intend to use a DSLR as a DSLR for normal light-condition photo-shooting, so 3 more higher ISO settings and video capture feature don't mean nothing at all.  3M more pixels may be good, but 12MP is more than enough for me because I usually look at pictures on my monitor and rarely print them (even more rare to make large prints), so they will always be scaled down.

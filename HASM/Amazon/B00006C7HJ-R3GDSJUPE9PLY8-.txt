Title: Danger!? Read all the reviews!
Content:
I wish I'd read the reviews! I just got two of these. The vortex thing is very real. I don't know all this fluidics stuff, but even with the almost-inaudible fan (must not be broken yet), they project a beam of air many feet. Stirs up the room nicely, and makes sure 90% of your electric bill isn't being spent on keeping the mounted moose head over the mantlepiece toasty warm while you freeze.{Later} Hmm! Just read Levien's review. I wonder if that explains the earlier reports of breakage. Anyway, I'm using two of these things as of a few days ago, and I love them to pieces (until they go defective, if they do). I'm going to treat them as extremely fragile and avoid any intentional jarring. I looked in through the cracks after reading the bad reviews, and I don't care for the construction.

Title: Don't do it.  This thing is bad news.
Content:
I bought this heater and returned it because it did not work properly and the advertising is misleading. Regardless of the temperature setting, it shut off only minutes after being turned on.    The photos of it are deceptive.  In the photos, the finish appears chrome.  In reality, it's a metallic metallic grey finish on the sides, with chrome feet, top and ends.  There is no "vintage cloth cord." Instead it has a thick black plastic cord. It's poorly made, feels cheap and has sharp edges on the feet that WILL scratch wood floors.  Make no mistake, this heater will leave you cold.

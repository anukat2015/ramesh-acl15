Title: Rubber tips stain butcher block counters
Content:
We bought the Cuisinart to replace another similar coffeemaker that finally died. The Cuisinart is a fine coffeemaker and we like its programmable feature. The only problem we have had is with the four rubber tips on the base. We recently had butcher block counters installed in our kitchen and the rubber tips left brown spots on our counter-top that we have not been able to remove. I wrote to Cuisinart about this problem and am still waiting for an answer. For now, we have the coffeemaker sitting on a metal sheet.

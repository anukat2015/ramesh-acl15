Title: Worked well, couldn't get past the smell
Content:
After I purchased the heater, I ran it according to the directions, on the highest setting for two hours in a ventilated area.  There was a odor when I first ran it.  I thought it would go away, but unfortunately it never did.  I would run it for varying periods of time, but the smell just never dissapated.  I can't be sure what the smell was, but I wondered if perhaps the manufacturer didn't use a high heat paint.  With all of the media coverage of items made in China with substandard or toxic materials, I wondered if this was the case!  I did exchange it for another, and sadly the second heater smelled as well.  The heater itself was a great size and worked well, but I just could not get past the awful smell.  
If you can get past the smell, I would recommend the heater, but if the odor is a point of concern, then you may want to bypass it.

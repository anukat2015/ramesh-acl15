Title: Sensor is too small for the number of pixels
Content:
I had it for  two days and decided to return it. I have the 5D, and when compared the picture quality in areas of noise and color artifact the XSI is just horrible. I had this feeling that I am using a point and shoot camera. IF ISO  set to 400 and lower camera produced a loss of detail and noise that impossible to correct in Adobe ACR. I am not sure that Canon is trying to sell something to a public that may not know better coming from P&S. 
Lens was Okay but slow focusing, and I am not sure that IS is even helping in low light, don't forget it is a $125 lens. Overall I am surprised by Canon is was always a leader in the field of photogear.

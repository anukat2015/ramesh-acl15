Title: Stolen XMAS Gift
Content:
I bought this Camera from my wife for Christmas to replace her Film Version of this camera.  I thought it would be a nice gift and allow her to explore Photography in a more creative way, since here wouldn't be any of the associated film and development costs for non-keeper shots.  She would also be able to use her existing lenses from her Film Camera (A standard zoom and telephoto zoom).
Boy was I stupid.  I'd was never into photography much before, but once I had the Digital Rebel XT in my house, I couldn't help but play with it every once in awhile.  Now, Not only have I stolen my wife's Camera, but her hobby as well.  I even recently purchased another 400 dollar lens... and have a long list (thousands of dollars worth) of new toys (photography equipment) I *NEED* to buy.
I do let my wife use the camera every once in awhile... but boy was this the best Christmas give I ever got.

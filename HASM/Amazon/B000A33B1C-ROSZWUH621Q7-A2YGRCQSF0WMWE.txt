Title: not impressed
Content:
We purchased this model last winter, after reading all the reviews and doing some online research. It does get hot but the heat does not circulate through the room. Since there is no fan attached the only way to feel the warm air is to stand over the heater. Unfortunately you have to be very close to the heater to feel the warmth. We ran a couple of experiments to see how to get the best value from our heater. We started out using the heater in our downstairs family room (standard 8ft ceiling but semi open floor plan), not effective. We moved it to our upstairs family room (lower ceilings) thinking that maybe it would be able to heat up this smaller space. Still not effective! I had to literally sit about a foot away from this heater to get any additional warmth.  This is not what we were looking for. Our little Holmes heaters actually give off more heat and the built in fan allow you to actually feel the warm air without standing directly over the heater. The one thing the delonghi dragon was good for was raising our electric bill. Not worth the extra expense for the small amount of heat given off.

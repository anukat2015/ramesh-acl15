Title: new iopd isn't worth the money
Content:
I am disappointed with this new ipod. I wanted to upgrade and get a larger GB one, I have a 2nd G 4gb nano and wanted more room for music. The radio is a nice feature but cannot use in docker and that is where I use the most. Of course with Apple there was not an instruction booklet and I had to go online to try and figure out how to use. The controls are not as easy to use and I get frustrated trying to get this ipod to play what I want. I cannot find a docker (JBL only) that will charge this new ipod and so I have to shuffle daily to unhook and connect to computer. My old ipod I never had to do this, the docker charged it. Don't get me wrong it's a nice unit, I love the green... but its harder to use and not as stable. I have a lot of problems with music skipping and it gets very annoying. If this is your first ipod get it! you will love it, but after having an older version... I am sorry I bought this. I actually went back to my 2nd G nano, much easier to use. They sent a tool that allows me to use with my docker so I was happy with that. I am unhappy with this product and the new itunes that you HAVE to download to use.

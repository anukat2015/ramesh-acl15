Title: DO NOT BUY THIS!
Content:
I read all the great reviews and unfortunately purchased it. Huge waste of money! The lower attachmnet broke after just 5 month of light use (once every 10-14 days) The suction is ok, but the machine itself is heavy, difficult to change attachments, and the dirt collection container needs to be emptied constantly with the following mess! It doesnt vacuum up anything hard etc etc
Wish I had bought it from a store where I could return it now...

My previous camera was a point and shoot Fuji. While I was very pleased with it, I wanted something that had a sharper image and exposed and colored existing light photos better -- less oranges, etc. The Rebel Xsi is great. It satisfies all of my wants save one -- I miss the 6X zoom on my old Fuji! The colors on the Rebel are just wonderful -- sunlight or artificial.

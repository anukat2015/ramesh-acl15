Title: Amazing for tile floors
Content:
I have tried 4 different vacuums, 2 types of broom and one dust mop to efficiently clean the all tile floors in my new home.  Nothing was satisfactory -- until I found this Dirt Devil Vision Turbo.  It is fast, efficient, easy to use -- in fact, the only thing better would be to have some other person actually doing the job!  I also have 3 dogs who spend a lot of time going in and out of the house to the back yard, and they bring the back yard into the house.  This vacuum has made it possible for me to easily vacuum a huge area daily.  I bought it based on other reviews I read here on Amazon, and I strongly support every good thing they said.

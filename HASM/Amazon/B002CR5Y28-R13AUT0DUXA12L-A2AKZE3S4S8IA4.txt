Title: Wish I bought this years ago
Content:
This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I can now vacuum my entire house in about 1/2 hour without breaking a sweat, whereas it used to take 2 hours with the old Kenmore cannister because I coudn't stand lugging it around. The old Kenmore vacuum was awkward, heavy, loud, parts would break on it left and right, and I'd procrastinate and take a lot of breaks when vacuuming with it. This new Miele Neptune is really quiet but the suction is way stronger than any vacuum I ever used. The parquet floor brush for bare floors is awesome, it has long brush hairs that work well on my deep-grouted tile floors and my smooth hardwood floors, it covers a big area with one swipe, but you can maneuver it into every corner and under things easily. The metal wand is extra long so you don't need to bend over at all and fatigue your lower back. The turbo head cleans my deep pile area rugs great too. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on the Kenmore 2 years ago and bought this Miele sooner, it is really lightweight, quiet, powerful, ergonomic, and well-made.

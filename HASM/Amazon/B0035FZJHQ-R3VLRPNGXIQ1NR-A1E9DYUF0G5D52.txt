Title: Super camera; horrible kit lens
Content:
Everything about the T2i BODY is superb (for the price); the kit lens is absolutely horrible.  Bottom line: the images are noticeably out of focus even without zooming in, which means either the lens is of insufficient quality (even for a $100 kit lens) or the camera has a defective sensor (unlikely but I will know soon).  I have previously owned a Nikon D60 and a Nikon D90 (a comparably priced camera these days) and neither had auto-focus issues with their kit lenses.  
NOTE: I am an above-average "amateur photographer", but a National Geographic photographer on the national mall just took a host of photos with my camera for me and had the same problem with the autofocus, even in the kit lens's "sweet spot" taking a stationary portrait. Trust me, not a settings issue or photographer error.    
I am returning the kit tomorrow to Best Buy and testing it with a quality zoom lens; if I still get poor images, I will revise this review to 1-star and recommend people wait until Nikon releases their HD autofocusing replacement for the D90, whenever that is.  
Until then, I would advise readers to BUY A T2i.... just don't buy the kit.  Put that extra $100 towards whatever zoom lens you can afford, or buy a couple cheap fixed focal length lenses (like the $99 Canon 50mm/f1.8 II) and best of luck!

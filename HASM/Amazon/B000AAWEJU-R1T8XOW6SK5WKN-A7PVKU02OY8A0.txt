Title: great little machine
Content:
Compact, quiet, great suction, and suction control options. Simple to use. The telescopic wand is great, as are the 360 degree turning wheels. The two different temporary housing slots for the wand make stopping and starting during the vacuuming session easy. The design of the Miele in terms of maintenance is simple and effective.
The only cons I can see are that the tool storage on the wand sometimes gets in the way when you want to vacuum under furniture; you need to take it off. Also, the on/off switch is not always very responsive.

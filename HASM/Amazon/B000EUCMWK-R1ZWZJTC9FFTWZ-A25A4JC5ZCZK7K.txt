Title: anything but an ipod
Content:
i got this b/c i was desperate for an ipod alternative, and it seemed to be a decent buy.  my main complaint is that every few days it refuses to play songs that i've downloaded onto it from yahoo music player (it will still play songs i've transferred from CDs).  when it does this it asks me to "plz sync the device".  i still haven't figured out what that means.  sometimes if i plug the device into my computer and alter the playlist a little, it's happy for another few days.  sometimes this doesn't work.  very frustrating.  also, it operates on AAA batteries and sucks them down like water.

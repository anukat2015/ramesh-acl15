Title: Crap,
Content:
I mabey only 12, but it wasn't just my computer, it was my families, just so ya know.I had a very similar model. And it was a piece of crap. All computers(well almost all) get virus's, even with protection software. I had 11 virus's after the first week. The video/graphics preformance on gateway laptops suck. If you really want one of these, then get the equivilent of this laptop, A GAMEBOY! If you want good preformance, especialy graphics and video, get a MAC. MACS have alot of ram, kick butt graphics/video cards, and have more hard drive space than any other laptop from gateway, intel, compaq,Spartan, Toshiba, or Dell. (DELL is probably the crapiest computer you can ever buy, thats why college's and schools have them. because they can't afford better one's.

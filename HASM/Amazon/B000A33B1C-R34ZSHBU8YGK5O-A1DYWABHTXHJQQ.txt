Title: Delonghi TRD0715T Safe Heat Oil-Filled Radiator
Content:
I bought this heater for my kids as an alternative heat for thier single wide mobile home. Because of the high cost of filling thier propane tank, they like to just heat the rooms they're using, and save the fuel for cooking and the water heater.  This works great to heat thier kitchen/dining room area, and then moved to the bedrooms at night. 
My husband and I are going to buy a second one for our house, as we heat with a wood stove and our own bedroom is freezing. I highly recommend it!

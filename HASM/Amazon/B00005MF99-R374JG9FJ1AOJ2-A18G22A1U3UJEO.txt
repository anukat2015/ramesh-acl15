Title: DCM-2500 Coffee Maker
Content:
This product does a good job of brewing coffee. The Carafe is well designed so it does not drip when you pour.
I don't like the 2 hour shut off time- would rather have an option to extend it.
We find water on the counter behind the coffee maker.  This is due to the design of the lid on the water storage tank.  When you raise the lid after coffee has been brewed, condensation inside the lid runs down  past the hinge and down the back of the coffee maker.  Seems like a little redesign of the lid could prevent this.

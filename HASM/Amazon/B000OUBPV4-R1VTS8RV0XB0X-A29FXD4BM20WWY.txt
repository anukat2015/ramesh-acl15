Title: DOA
Content:
I purchased this camera from employee discount for $900. When I got the camera it wouldn't work. After shooting one image, camera got locked up. shutter wouldn't come back down, nor switch off. I had to pull out the battery to reset. that's not the worst part, Returning back to fujifilm was so much hassle that I had call my AMEX to dispute the charges to get my full refund back. Never again will I buy fujifilm. unfortunately I work for the company ;(

Title: Amazon was a delight to deal with
Content:
I ordered this camera body, a lens hood and a memory card from Amazon. I received everything in perfect condition, with no problems and on time. I was able to track each item online and the camera and memory card arrived a week ahead of schedule (even using the free, but slow, free delivery) and the hood arrived right on the scheduled day. Also, Amazon had the best prices, no sales tax and free delivery. You can save more than a few bucks if you're willing to wait a few days.

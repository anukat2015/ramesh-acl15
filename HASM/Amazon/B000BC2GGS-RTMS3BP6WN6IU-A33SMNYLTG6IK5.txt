Title: a very good choice
Content:
The honeywell works well and is really silent. It provides enough heat for an average size room. Because it has no fan, it may take a few extra minutes to warm the whole room, not a problem. Has various digital settings for time and temperature. I recommend you choose a time for it to turn itself off as it's so quiet you may forget. Although it's low and unobtrusive, it is approximately 40 inches long, which may be awkward for some. Overall a very good choice for the price.

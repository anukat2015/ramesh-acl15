Title: The best on the market.
Content:
The first thing you notice... as many others have already mentioned is the size. It's much smaller than you would expect. The build quality is fantastic. The screen is incredible. The ear buds SUCK. Microsoft... don't package them with ear buds if that's all the better you can do. It does this incredible machine a huge disservice. Hook some mid level Shure's up to this thing and you've found the grail. The software is great... it rips disks about three times faster than the fruit company.  The HD radio is great - I can't believe it's not standard at this price level.  The navigation is first rate and fast.

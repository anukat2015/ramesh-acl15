Title: WONDERFUL!! - Get it...you will NOT regret it!
Content:
This is a WONDERFUL machine! We are huge coffee drinkers at my house. My husband was in the Army for 23 years and love a good strong cup of coffee. He is not easily impressed by new machines. I was stunned and amazed that after only 2 cups of the Keurig coffee brewer coffee, he has now suggested taking the old coffee maker out of the kitchen all together! This is the best price around. I did a lot of online research and you get the biggest bang for your buck here on QVC. I have three children (9 -13) who love to use this machine. The noise related to the brewing is so short that it has been no problem at all. I live in MI so I did let the machine come to room temperature before I started it up and it worked just fine. My sister lives here also and didn't wait for her machine to come to room temperature. She did have an issue with it not programming correctly, but she called the Keurig toll-free # and they had it reprogrammed and up working for her within a matter of minutes. She is more than impressed with her machine also. If you are stopping only a couple of times a week for a cup of coffee shop coffee, you will recover you money and then some from the purchase of this brewer when you brew your commuter cup at home in the morning. Get it...you will be glad you did! Enjoy!!

Title: Great DSLR For the price
Content:
I had my K200 for about 18 Months and have over 50k exposures and I can say it does hunt (trying to focus) on some shots where there are too many reference points, it depends on your f-stop, the buffer speed is slow and yes it is the noise reduction feature, this camera is not so good at night shots but overall its one of the best for unique features like, water, dust resistant and AA battery use. I use rechargeable one and if you want to just make sure they are the 2,650mAh capacity I get about 2k exposures per charge. This camera is great if you want to be able to take in the next step in Photography. I've used my in 120degree desert conditions to below freezing and hurricane weather, and never had to worry about dust or water getting in the camera. Flickr has a group for the Pentax K200 check out the quality of this camera.

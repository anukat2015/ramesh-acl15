Title: Worst purchase ever made
Content:
I've had this machine for about 18 months. After about 6 months of use, the coffee side started leaking until now it does not work any more.  I contacted DeLonghi and all they had to say was to take it to a service center, which by the way are few and far apart.  My previous coffee/espresso machine was a Krups and it lasted for 10 years.  I will never buy DeLonghi products again and certainly do not recommend this product. Mine will go into the trash and we'll replace it with another brand.

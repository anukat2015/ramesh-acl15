Title: Really disappointed
Content:
We thought we had the perfect answer for heating our 6 x 14  camping trailer wired for 120V hookup. Great features; compact, light, thermostat, anti-freeze feature, very quiet,circulating fan and fan only for those warm days. Just perfect. Problem is, it just doesn't work.Only thing that works is the on/off button that lights up but no air, no heat, no nothing. And if it is as fragile as other reviewers attest, we sure wouldn't want to depend on it on a frosty night. Company may be in trouble. We called the warranty number(got the automated weekend message on a Monday afternoon) and the customer service number on the box (got another operator message to call a 10-10 number which would cost $3.00). Good luck. Back to the drawing board.

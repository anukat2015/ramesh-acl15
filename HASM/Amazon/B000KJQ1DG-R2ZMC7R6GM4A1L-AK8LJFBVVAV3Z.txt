Title: Best Camera for the Money
Content:
Besides being incredibly inexpensive for a DSLR this camera has one other advantage to any other DSLR: Size and Weight. This is the kind of camera you can take on a bike ride or a ski trip. And with the right lens on it it'll take photos that are nearly indistinguishable from a much more expensive camera.
If you really geek out on camera features and are constantly educating yourself about photography you will find that you reach the edge of this cameras capability but unless you're a really advanced amateur you won't find that your pics get any better with a more expensive camera.
Even though I own a much higher-end Nikon I still find myself reaching for my D40 whenever I'm going out to take casual shots.
If you do get this camera the first upgrade you should make is to buy a 50mm f1.4 AF-S lens.

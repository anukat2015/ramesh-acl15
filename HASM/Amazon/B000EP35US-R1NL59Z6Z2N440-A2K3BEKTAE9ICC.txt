Title: Ipod
Content:
I am a grandmother and know nothing about Ipods. What I do know is that my niece wanted an Ipod for her high school graduation.I bought it and all she does is rave about it. My grandson is graduating from jr.high school this month and he wants the same Ipod. They rave about it, their friends all want one. What  else can a grandmothr say? It was a successful gift purchase and I might just get one for myself.

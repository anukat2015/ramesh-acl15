Title: Great camera
Content:
Not the most advance camera but good enough for normal photo taking. Nice vintage look that is classy and time withstanding. Built seems better than entry level camera and has good grips. Interesting features includes 2 angle bounce flash, aperture and shutter dial and of course Leica looking design and icon. Produces nice looking photos as well. Cons includes slower focus (comparatively), 2.5" non swivel LCD, lack of accessories. The fact that new cameras does not swirl me to upgrade proofs that this camera is more than good enough for most user. Will be keeping this camera for quite awhile.

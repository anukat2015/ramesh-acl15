Title: Fantastic
Content:
Had been using a Rainbow vacuum cleaner, had to have it serviced every few months.  This cleaner collected an amazing amount of fine dirt using it right after vacuuming with the Rainbow.  Amazing sucking power, very pleased, wish I had tried this vacuum before I spent hundreds of dollors on the last Rainbow sweeper.

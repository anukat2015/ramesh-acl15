Content:
the temperature gage on this product cant be used unless you put it in maximum 1500.   if you want to put it in 900 mode you cant regulate the temperature.   also when you turn it off and turn if back on instead of being in low it is in high.      so if the electricity goes out in the middle of the night i would have to reset it to low.    i think it should be able to maneuver more easily and it doesnt.   i was very disappointed.

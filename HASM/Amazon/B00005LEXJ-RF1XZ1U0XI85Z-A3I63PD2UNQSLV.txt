Title: Besurre its outdoors
Content:
I ordered this hurriedly in the middle of a really cold snap when I needed a heater for my workshop. My workshop is in a schoolbus. This heater throws off good heat! No doubt about it. I ran it for about a half hour and it was warm enough to work so I shut it off. Within the hour I was disoriented, had a severe headache, and as my knees began to give out I thought "carbon monoxide poisoning!" I got out and after a few hours I was OK. Be sure not to use this indoors!!!

Title: Great, silent heater for bedroom or small room
Content:
I bought this heater about 1 month ago to deal with the cold months in my apartment and have been very impressed.
My apartment only has a central heater and none in the bedroom so I was looking for something to provide the warmth that just blankets could not.
The outside air temperature where I live drops to near freezing during the night time and when I turn this on 1 hour in advance, my 10'x10' room gets to a very nice temperature before I sleep.
Pros:
 - Silent (unlike ceramic heaters)
 - No light (unlike dishes)
 - Works very well for small rooms
 - Pleasing to look at and doesn't take up much space
 - Safe to touch if you accidentally bump into it
Cons:
 - None

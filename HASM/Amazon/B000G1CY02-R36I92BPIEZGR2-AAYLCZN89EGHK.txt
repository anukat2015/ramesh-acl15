Content:
After considering user reviews and Consumer Reports' recommendation, I purchased this because of its safety, efficiency, and price. I am not sorry! I am using it in an old house where the heat is not evenly-distributed. I need to keep my ferret's area at an even temperature of around 70 degrees. Because of its design, this heater warms a much larger area directly, and an entire room indirectly, than a small space heater that blows hot air. I have an indoor digital thermometer (Walmart, $4.97) on the ferret's cage so using that, in conjunction with the heater's controls, I can control the room temperature. For greater satisfaction, read the user manual. It tells you how to set "temperature" using the clicking noise of the thermostat in the heater. It also clearly states that you should burn off the chemical smell first by running it in a well-ventilated area for about two hours when you take it out of the package. I did this and the smell went away. I haven't gotten the electric bill yet but I am assuming that it is much more energy-efficient than the space heater I was using just because of how it is designed. Also, for those with old houses, it does not require a 3-prong outlet! In response to those reviewers whose heaters died early, the company has a one-year warranty and offers another two years of coverage for $18. I think this is one of the best deals I have ever gotten.

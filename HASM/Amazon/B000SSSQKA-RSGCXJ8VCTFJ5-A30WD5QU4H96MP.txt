Title: Great Little Canister Vac
Content:
I've owned this vacuum for about a year. It replaced another Panasonic canister vac that I had for 30 years (with never a breakdown!), so I trusted this to be equally as well-made. My only criticism is the length of the cord. I'd prefer a longer one so more area could be vacuumed without having to change outlets. The suction is powerful and the suction adjustment knob is an added bonus. I have tile and hardwood floors plus 7 animals, but my house is always hair-free thanks to this strong lightweight vac. 
P.S. My old Panasonic vac still lives on at my friend's house and hasn't quit yet. Hurray to Panasonic for making such quality products!

Title: Feels better.
Content:
SO I had about 3 camaeras in one month to test them out.They where the Nikon D80, canon XSi and the sony A300. The Nikon D80 felt the best in my hand and build quality just felt better ecspecially when spending alot of money. Ths XSI and A300 had some great features but I kept coming back to the nikon.
The XSi had a plastic feel. And the Sony felt good build wise but the flip screen I felt got in the way of my face using the viewfinder.
So hope that helps a little.

Title: This thing sucks! (in a great way)
Content:
Got mine today for $132 at a local store. When I ran it over the throw rug, it ATTACKED the thing as if it wanted blood. Man! Makes my old vacuum look like a light breeze moving through the valley.
Pros:
(1) Great suction
(2) Easy to set up and get going
(3) Easy to wash and maintain (both the HEPA filter and the cyclones)
(4) Extension handle and hose
(5) Attachments for extension handle
(6) Lights the path you are vacuuming
(7) Adjustable for rugs, bare floors, and heights of each
(8) Is a solid appliance--just enough heft to it but not too much
(9) Less than half the price of a Dyson
Cons: 
(1) Cord attaches to the vacuum in a "please trip over me" position
(2) The vacuum is not supposed to be run with moisture in the cyclone chamber, but good luck getting every bit of moisture out of all those nooks and crannies
(3) Made by the same company that makes those cheapo Shark cordless vacuums--that scares me 
I'd recommend buying one of these locally and returning it within the 30 day window, if it dies on you.

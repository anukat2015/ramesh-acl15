Title: Makes great coffee
Content:
Very pleased.  A bit tall and difficult to pour water into the reserve tank.  Also, the lid to the coffee pot isn't hinged.  It snaps on and off and is hard for my 82 year old mother to get off to empty old coffee and put fresh water into.  However, it can be done without removing the lid, just takes a bit more time and coordination to fill with fresh water.

Title: Superb!
Content:
I have had the macbook pro for a month now. I have had no problems with it; everything works as it should. Installing windows xp on it was a piece of cake too! I don't really need/use windows except for a particular program (Origin).I also have a powerbook G4 which is 5 years old but still runs very well! 
So from my past experience with Apple, I think it's safe to say that this baby will last for a really long time!

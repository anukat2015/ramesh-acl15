Title: Pretty in Pink!
Content:
I purchased the pink Creative Zen Micro 5gb about 3 months ago and I have had no difficulties with it so far. PROS: It sounds Great!  Soo cute in pink (with blue backlight..yay).  I love it because I just get all my songs for $6.99 a month from Yahoo! Music Unlimited and upload them to my mp3 player (reallyy convenient...it beats paying .99 cents a song for Itunes..)  I really do love it.  You can buy a new battery for it once yours goes dead (IPOD's must be sent to the Apple Store for $100 to get a new battery installed in it...that sucks..)  
However, CONS: the ear plugs are horrible...dont even try to keep these around.  
  
Overall, I would still buy it today if I had to make the decision all over again.

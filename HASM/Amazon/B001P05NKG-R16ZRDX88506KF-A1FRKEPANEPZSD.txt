Title: A True Pro Laptop
Content:
I purchased the Unibody MacBook in October, and I sold it just to get the new MacBook Pro. I have to agree that the new 13" MacBook Pro deserves the name "Pro" in it now. It has much better features, and this should have been the computer that the Unibody MacBook was back in October. Ever since Apple introduced the Unibody MacBook, many people complained about the loss of FireWire and the terrible screen quality. Fortunately, Apple responded to those complaints with the new 13" MacBook Pro. The return of FireWire has made a lot of people happy, and the surprising addition of the SD Card slot made it even better. The quality of the screen is also a lot better. The screen displays much better colors, and it still carries the revolutionary LED backlit. 
The pricing of the MacBook Pro line has also dropped significantly. The original 15" Pro was starting at the price of $1999, but they dropped it by $300 making it $1699. The Unibody MacBook was asking for $1299, but they are now asking for $1199 with the addition of the new features. I am very pleased that they dropped the price, as it is very rare to hear Apple drop their prices. The new features make it much more affordable. The computer still looks identical to the previous October notebook revision. It still carries the sexy Unibody design, and the backlit keyboard is now standard on all models. I actually find the backlit keyboard very useful, even as a touch typist. The gorgeous glass multi-touch trackpad still pleases me with the features and the size. 
After the rebranding of the Unibody MacBook, and the addition of the new features. Apple has really stepped up to the plate. They successfully tightened up the competition, as the new MacBook Pro line is now much more affordable and is priced very well. The new 13" MacBook Pro does feel like a "Pro" computer, where the performance is hard to feel unsatisfied. The graphics are incredible. Even if you feel that the MacBook Pro line is still too much, Apple is also offering the classic MacBook line for a low price of $999. If you purchase this laptop now, you'll be able to upgrade to Snow Leopard for only $10. With the gorgeous Unibody design, LED backlit display, and trackpad, $1199 is a price that cannot be beaten. Great job Apple!

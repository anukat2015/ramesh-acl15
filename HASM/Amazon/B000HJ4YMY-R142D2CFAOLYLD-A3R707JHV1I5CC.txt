I struggled with my purchase between the Nikon D40, D80, the Sony Alpha, Canon XTi, but ultimately made a great decision.  This camera will do it all.  My wife can shoot auto mode and get great shots, I can shoot in customized / priority or manual modes and get the action shots I want.  Easy to use, lots of glass available, quick, light, and fun to shoot.

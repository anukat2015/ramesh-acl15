Title: Short-lived
Content:
This heater lasted for only one and a half seasons. Towards the middle of the second season of use, the heater fan began making an unusually loud rattling sound and emitting a burning smell. It appears that the heater fan is of poor quality. Sunpentown's warranty lasts only a year, leaving me with no recourse other than to throw good money after bad by mailing the heater to them for paid repairs. $80 for a heater that is so short-lived (and dangerous to boot) is a rip off.

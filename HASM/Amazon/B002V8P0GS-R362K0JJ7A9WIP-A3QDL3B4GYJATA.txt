Title: Great machine

I bought this awesome computer at walmart the other night for $350.00!! Totally worth the money.  I don't know much about computers but this computer was selling for the price of most net books so I could not pass it up.  So far is has been working great for all my computer needs.  I mainly send email, upload photos, download music and simple everyday stuff and it seems to be working fine for my needs.  I own a small online business and it has been wonderful having a fully functioning laptop that is very light and sleek to take around with me when I need it.  The built in fan is great at keeping the laptop cool and I have not had any really problems with it heating up or anything like that. The screen is nice and big and bright and perfect for my needs.  I have yet to try to the burner but I will assume that it works.   I was able to connect to the internet as soon as I go it out of the box and it is just cool and I can not believe it got it for this price.  The 10 key pad is definitely a plus and the keyboard is a nice size and very simple to use.  I type pretty fast and I haven't had any problems with it as far as position and confortablility.  The only problem that I have had so far is I can't get my zune program on it it which is frustrating because zune is made by Microsoft and shouldn't be a problem at all.  This computer is not the fastest computer but it gets the job done.  I love windows 7!

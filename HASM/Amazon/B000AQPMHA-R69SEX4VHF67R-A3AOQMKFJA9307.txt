Title: Great coffee but the environmental cost weighs on my conscious
Content:
This thing makes great coffee but after owning one for a few months I sold it on craigslist.  The pile of plastic cups you generate after a few weeks of usage is enough to drown someone in a mountain of single-serving guilt.  I've gone back to using my old coffee maker.

Title: Leaks, leaks, leaks...
Content:
While the container itself does not leak, everytime you open the top, the condensation will run down  the back. This happens no matter how much time between pots. Look under the unit after filling with water and you'll see a huge puddle of condensation. They made a half baked effort to catch the drips in the back (there is a small lip) but it doesn't come close to catching all the water that runs down the back. Sloppy engineering from a "high end" brand. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

Title: Now makes Iced Coffee too!
Content:
Moving to FL from Massachusetts where there was a DD on every corner, we had to find a good coffee maker. Well, we did even better! My husband likes flavored coffee and I prefer "regular" coffee. Instead of brewing 2 pots every morning we each get to pick our own. There are so many flavors to choose from, everyone is sure to find a favorite. We owned our B60 model for a year and just upgraded to the B70. Five of our friends/family have also purchased after seeing ours and they love it too! Now, you can brew a 4 oz. cup to make Iced Coffee with the newer model - B70 (be careful when buying -there are still older ones on the shelf).
This is the coffee maker to own. It makes great coffee and looks so cool on the counter too. 
**Our favorites are Green Mountain--X-Bold, Nantucket Blend, Blueberry, French Vanilla, Pumpkin Spice and Lake/Lodge.

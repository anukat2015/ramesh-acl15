Title: GREAT A/C UNIT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Content:
I use this in my bedroom. It gets really hot, especially in the summer, and I also have a lot of electronic equipment(av receiver, Xbox 360, PS3, LCD tv, some halogen lamps, etc.) and to top that all off I am really hot natured. So I needed something to keep the room cool. This thing does it effortlessly. The temp. in my room used to climb up to 75ºF, now with the SoleusAir it stays at around 66-68ºF, just how I like it. On a side note, my central A/C went out last summer and it got up to 83ºF in my house, but the SoleusAir kept it at a cool 68ºF in my room. So you can count on it even under the most demanding loads. It also has a built-in heater as well and it heats as well as it cools. So this is really an all-in-one unit. The only downside(along with any other portable a/c unit) is that you must run 2 hoses(one exhaust, one intake) to a window. It comes with a window installation kit, but I live near a busy street so I can sometimes hear outside noise... but it's not too bad.
But I would highly recommend this product.

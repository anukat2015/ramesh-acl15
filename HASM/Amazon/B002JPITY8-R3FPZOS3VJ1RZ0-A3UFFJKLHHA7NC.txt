Title: Really Slick
Content:
The other reviews are very good, I don't have much to add.
I use quite a few different MP3 players.  Among them are the 120GB GOW Zune, ipod classic, Samsung P3, Sansa Clip, ipod touch, and now the Zune HD.  The HD is very slick, clean design, solid, light, and the display is very sharp.  I am starting to like the Zune software as well.  I wish the HD had some more EQ settings, but for me, it wasn't a deal breaker, though I would be very happy if they added some in a future update.  I am very happy with the product, and of course Amazon's great price didn't hurt.

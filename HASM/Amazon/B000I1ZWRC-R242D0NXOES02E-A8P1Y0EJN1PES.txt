Title: so much to learn still
Content:
I just have to say that I am so happy with my purchase of the Rebel XTi. It is so easy to use, and the quality of photos is just wonderful. I am still busy learning how to use the MANY functions of the camera, so I know it will still bring me so much more joy than it already does. I recommend this camera to anyone who loves to take photos. It is worth it!

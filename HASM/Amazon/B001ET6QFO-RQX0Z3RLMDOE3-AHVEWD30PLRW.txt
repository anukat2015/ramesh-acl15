Title: Better Than My 40D!!!!!
Content:
I purchased my 40D upgrade from my 30D last Aug for my Bday only to find out 30 days later a 50 was on the way(ouch!). I bought the 50 anyway & kept my 40 which I loved. Boy, what a jump! I love this camera! as "Jodi-Ann" so eloquently put it. The DIGIC 4 is a step up. Pix are absolutely amazingly sharp. And I don't mean sharp because of the new Hi-Res LCD, I mean SHARP-SHARP because I printed them out right away on a 8x10 and 16x20 from my Epson Stylus Pro 3800. Wow! Is my reaction as I so patiently watched the printer print them out. 
I received my 50 body last Friday from here through ElectronicsExpo which came in earlier than promised. I shot pix all Sat & Sun. Ear to ear smile is my first impression. I'm not gonna get into techs bcoz I don't have to, your eyes can tell you. Plus the great reviewers here already have & that's why I bought it. I used my "24-70F2.8L & 50F1.2L glasses." took variety of shots from standard setting to pumped up saturation to B&W then produced some prints runnin' Lightroom 2. My assessments were, "My 40 was great, Presto 50 is even better!" 
If you can swing the $$$ its worth it! If stepping up is a strain or near impossible it's ok, your 40D is still great! If this will be your first DSLR & thinking Canon but on a budget then the 40D will be a bargain now that the 50 is here (the 30D is a real bargain as well as an excellent starter). Either one is excellent, but the 50D supercedes its predecessors.
PS. Thanks a million to the positive reviewers here - you guys make the Difference in the World!

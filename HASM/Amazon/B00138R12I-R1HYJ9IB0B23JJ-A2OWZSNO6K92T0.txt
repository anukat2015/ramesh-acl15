Title: Best Camera in this price range, hands down.
Content:
I have owned the Sony alpha A300 for a little over a year now. Coming from a traditional film camera background, I find this camera very easy to use while supporting all the features that I need. Sony's liveview is the quickest you're likely to find, and the technology incorporated into the A300 is second to none, and the very useful in the body shake reduction (coupled with legacy minolta lens compatibility) make high quality lenses quite affordable when compared to other camera brands.
With that being said, I am slightly disappointed with the image quality straight out of the camera. I find that with stock glass, images tend to be a bit soft, and need richness added in post processing. (This should be expected with a camera in this class though.) The average user who is likely to purchase a camera in this price range will probably not notice much of a difference between the Sony and its competition, and I've found the Sony to be a much better price. I am simply suggesting that the body outperforms the kit glass, and stepping up to a G series, or zeiss lens would really help with the lack of richness. (I'm probably being picky here. A person will likely never notice unless his images are printed over 13".)
This camera really shines when a person leaves the stock modes and sets picture style, and aperture to his liking. The lower ISO's perform beautifully, and I personally don't ever have a need to venture beyond an occasional ISO 800, so noise has never been an issue for my work. Autofocus could be a bit quicker, but again, of the cameras in this price range a person isn't likely to do much better. All in all I love this camera and find it very enjoyable to shoot with.

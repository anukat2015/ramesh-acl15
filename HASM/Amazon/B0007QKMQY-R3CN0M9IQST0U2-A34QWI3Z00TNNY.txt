Title: My first DSLR. Love it!
Content:
Comfortable, lightweight, and easy to use; with a wealth of options available as I work my way up the SLR food chain. Great photo quality, my only complaint is that in low light without flash the EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 gets a lil' bleary. Still, I expect that the IS version of the lens when I get it will help alleviate that difficulty. Crystal clear pictures under normal lighting conditions and the automatic flash will take care of low-light conditions until I get the lens with image stabilization. Professional-looking photos (with my graphic designer background) right out of the box. Easy enough to use that I had no qualms in sending it with my mom to a wedding she was attending and she's STRICTLY point and shoot.

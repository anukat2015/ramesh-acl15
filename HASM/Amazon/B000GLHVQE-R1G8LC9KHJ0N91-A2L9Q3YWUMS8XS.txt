Title: Ambience Plus
Content:
I love this little heater! It turned out to be much nicer than
I expected. I loved it so much I immediately bought the more expensive
model to place on the other end of my 60-ft mobile home which has an
add-on room at one end. This one heats up the add-on room very quickly
and brings the overall temp up 2 degrees within minutes reducing the need
to use my fuel-oil heater. This smaller unit has 2 heat settings and standing about 2 feet in front of the heater, you can feel the warmth 
much more than standing closer to it. For a small space, this is a great
heater and the flames are so realistic you will feel warmer just with the ambience it creates!

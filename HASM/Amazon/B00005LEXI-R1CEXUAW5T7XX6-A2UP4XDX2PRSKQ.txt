Title: WOW!! BEST little heater!
Content:
This is just the greatest, exactly what I was expecting and put off more heat than expected. Bought it to heat a small hunting shack in the woods, actually need to take the hunting coat off to be comfortable. It is so light weight to carry. Nothing but good things to say, easy, simple, I leave a large propane tank out in the shack, quick and easy hook up and I am cozy in no time!!!!!

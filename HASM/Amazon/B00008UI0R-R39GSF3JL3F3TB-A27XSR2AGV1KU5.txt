Title: Powerful, lightweight, and easy to use
Content:
Compared with the old - dead - Kenmore cannister (a large & heavy piece of crap) that we overpaid as in $600 for 12 years ago (over my objections) - this little Hoover is better & stronger from the onset.  Powerful, light - so you can carry the power unit in one hand while vacuming with the hose in the other- manuverable - not large or clumsy to get around the furniture, adjustable suction level is great for hard floors vs. Persian rugs, and simple to empty.  The filters can easily be cleaned out with compressed air (air compressor in the garage) if you prefer not to wash them.
THE PRICE IS RIGHT FOR THIS UNIT!!  THE PERFORMANCE IS SUPERB!!!

Title: The 80 GB Zune is good!
Content:
I own a 80GB Zune and wanted to give one to my wife for her birthday.  She has been having lots of fun with it, doing various things.  It is great for her needs.
Perhaps the only thing it lacks are some games to play on it, but I don't consider that a serious drawback.
I recommend the 80 GB Zune to anyone considering a MP3 player.

Title: Ceramic Tower Heater with remote
Content:
I purchased this item from Amazon about 1 month ago.  I live in the South Jersey area and the Fall is usually a mild season so it was hard for me to gauge the ability of this heater to warm an area and at a reasonable electric charge.
Well we are in December as of this writing and we have just experienced a 24" snow fall and temperatures in the low teens.
The heater has a thermostat that operates only in the high temp mode and it oscillates.  I have an area room that is 12 x 12 and has a hallway at the end of the room.  The thermostat for my home furnace is about 6 feet down that hallway.  I set the thermostat on the heater at 65.  In a short period of time, probably about 20 minutes and starting at a temp of 55 (while at work) it takes about 15 minutes for this heater and the home furnace (I turn this up to 65 when I come home) to bring the temp in this area up to 65.  From that time on the home furnace only comes on at very infrequent intervals if at all.  Considering the wind chill factor for the past week or so is in single digits or the low teens, I think this is outstanding.  I have not had a full month of this cold weather so it is hard to determine what the increased cost in my electric bill will show.  I am predicting in the 20-25 a month range and I expect to cut the use time of my home furnace in half.  I burn kerosene and consdier this:  I just had 100 gallons delivered at the senior citizen discounted cost of $341.00.  Do the math.
The heater fan is audible if you don't have the TV on but not annoyingly so; with the TV playing I don't even notice the fan.
I paid 45.00 for this heater and I think it is one of the best purchases I have made in recent times. The heater is attractive, takes up very little space, and does what I paid for; what more could I want?
And as always.  I purchased this through Amazon.  It arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition and shipped via Amazon Prime.  I have been purchasing items from Amazon for more that two years and I am completely satisfied with them.

Title: DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!
Content:
This vacuum didn't last very long till it broke, but I didn't like it at all anyway. The handle was short so you'd have to stoop over to vacuum!!! It was also heavy, clumsy and cumbersome. I do NOT recommend this vacuum. I have had Dirt Devil vacuums in the past that I loved. This one was a huge disappointment and a waste of money.

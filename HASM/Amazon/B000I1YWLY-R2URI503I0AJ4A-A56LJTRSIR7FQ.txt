Title: Very Happy with this vacuum
Content:
We live in the country and have 3 dogs.  There's a lot of dust out here and foxtails everyday (in the house). We have carpet through out the house.  I vacuum almost every day, and I love this vacuum.  It works great, haven't had any problems with it.  Love the telescoping wand for up high places, it's very convenient. It's easy to clean and it's cute too.

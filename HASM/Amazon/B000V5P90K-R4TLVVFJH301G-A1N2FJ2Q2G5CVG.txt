Title: Great buy, worth every penny
Content:
Many other reviews cover this product more in depth, so I will bullet point it
Pros 
6.5 frames per second, great for sports
Improved color for vibrant pictures
Noise reduction is incredible, noise at 1600 not noticeable  
Big Screen, easy to preview shots
10mp for poster quality prints
Ergonomic, big and fits comfortable in hand
Lightweight, doesn't tire out your hand after a long day of shooting
Cons:
Size C image sensor (1.6 crop factor)
Autofocus a little less accurate than the D1 for obvious reasons

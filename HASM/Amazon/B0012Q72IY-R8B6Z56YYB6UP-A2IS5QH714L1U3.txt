Title: Nice camera!
Content:
I also own a K1000 slr that I got in 1986. I bought this camera specifically because my other lenses should fit it. Unfortunately, my 80 mm zoom from JCPenney does not. There is one piece that is too big. My true Pentax lenses fit. 
So far I love the camera. The pics are incredible. But I hate the photo software that comes with it. It is not intuitive (ie, you have to read the instructions) and I have yet to figure out how to resize images to make them less than 2.5 megs. 
Don't forget to buy a memory card. The camera has no internal memory at all. 
The size is nice, fits well in my hand and it's light enough to hold with one hand. I like the built in flash especially after years of using one with the hot shoe.

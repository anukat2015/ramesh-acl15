Title: very functional
Content:
This little vac has suprisingly powerful suction, especially for it's size and very light weight. We have mostly hardwood and vinyl floors, and the floor attachment works very well on those surfaces, as well as carpet. With the included turbo brush attachment for upholstery, and the crevice tool, it does all we need.
This is a very good basic vacuum, for the money. My only negative is the limited user manual. There is no reference to the choice of using the included cloth bag, or paper bags.

Title: Overall a great product
Content:
I got the 8gb red zune for Christmas 5 months ago.  I haven't had any problems with it other than running out of memory because of my thousand some songs.  The Zune Pass they offer is a steal.  Practically unlimited downloads for 14.99/month with only a few artists not supported.  I have yet to have any problems with my device, just the accessories.  The headphones they give you are ok, but you can get better for ten bucks at wal-mart.  My USB connector had one of the parts fall off so for me to be able to remove my Zune from the cord I have to use a pen or something small.  But overall the Zune is a great product, comes with 5 games, limitless downloads for $15, and just a lot of great music.

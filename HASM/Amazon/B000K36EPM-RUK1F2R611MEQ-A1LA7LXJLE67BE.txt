Title: Not a good idea and a waste of money
Content:
This wasn't a good idea to purchase this and I should have known better.  As another review stated stainless steel will never replace glass as an insulator.  This was delivered to me on June 15th and I have been trying to get used to the thing.  There is no good way to open the cap in order to pour coffee.  If you open it just a little, nothing comes out and if you open it more, make sure you hold onto the top or it will fall off. 
Today I made coffee and the whole thing backed up on me, ran all over the counter and onto the floor, grounds and water combined.  The paper filter was still in place as it should be so no reason there to overflow.  I cleaned it all out, added more coffee and water and lo, and behold, it doesn't work at all.  The clock doesn't come on and none of the buttons work.  What a waste of nearly $60.  all for nothing!!!!!

Title: I love my iPod!!
Content:
Before I decided on buying my first mP3 player, I did a bunch of research on which ones were best rated. I decided on a 30gb video iPod. Let me just say, I'm very happy with the choice I made.
Most reviews complained about scratching and poor battery life. About the scratching, I have NONE. I've kept the plastic cover that came on it in the package on the front screen and wheel. ABSOLUTLY NO SCRATCHES. You can't even tell the plastic is on it! Just wipe it clean if it gets smudges, and you're good to go! The chrome back is prone to fingerprints, but if you get a case, like I did, you don't have to worry about that!
The battery life, I'll admit isn't as good as I have thought. I haven't completely drained my battery yet, so I'm not sure of the actual hours of battery life. One way to use less battery is to change the option to have the screen light on for 5 seconds instead of the 15 it's preset with. I haven't used video, but after just seeing cover art pictures on it, I think the video quality is pretty good.
Pros:
-Tons of storage. I've uploaded every cd and mp3 I have at my house on my ipod, and I have over half the space left!
-Easy to work with. iTunes is a great music program. Uploading is a cinch. It organizes playlists and artists for you. Searching through songs is very simple.
-It looks so awesome! If you're looking for a fashionable case and are willing to a little spend money, the gold kate spade broome street ipod case looks amazing with the black ipod.
-Free engraving on apple.com. Why wouldn't you want it personalized?
-Good sound quality. Being in the music business, I know a thing or two about sound quality. It sounds better than cds!
Cons
-Battery life isn't 15 hours like apple claims. Real battery life is probably between 5 and 8 hours. Longer if you don't keep the back light on.
-It doesn't come with a wall charger. That was really my only complaint about this product. Apple.com over charges for them and you have to buy the cord seperately. You can find cheaper/better deals on ebay or at target.
-The ear buds kind of suck. I have really small ears though, so maybe that's why. You can plug pretty much any headphones into an ipod as long as the jack size isn't too big. 
So if you're looking for an mp3 player with lots of storage, and cost isn't as important as quality, an ipod would probably be a good choice.

Title: Kudos to Capresso!
Content:
I've only had this unit a few days but couldn't be happier.  The combo of built-in burr grinder and thermal carafe is perfect for me.  French roast brews up bold, smooth-tasting, not a hint of bitterness--without using the unit's optional charcoal filter.  The internal coffee grinder is comparatively quiet and ends the mess of transfering coffee from a stand-alone grinder. 
I previously owned a Capresso CoffeeTec w/thermal carafe but no internal grinder.  That unit lasted for years, made great tasting coffee and had quality thermal carafes--I had 3 to keep coffee hot for a crowd.  It really won me over as a Capresso fan.  When the old unit's water pump finally quit--would probably still be going if I'd cleaned it more often--I was very disappointed to see that the CoffeeTec had been discontinued.  
So I set about comparing different models and makers and reviews and finally settled on this new Capresso model, since it was coming out soon with a thermal carafe.  I was somewhat sceptical of the built-in grinder, but thought I'd go ahead and give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  Not only am I getting great-tasting, hot coffee--it's still hot in the carafe after 3 hours--but that never-ending electrostatic trail of flying coffee grounds from my stand-alone grinder to the coffee maker is a thing of the past!  And the Capresso's grinder is so much quieter that my Krups. 
Kudos to Capresso for another great product!

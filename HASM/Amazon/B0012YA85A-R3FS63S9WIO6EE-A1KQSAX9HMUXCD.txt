Title: Plum Happy with Xsi
Content:
Being a recent convert from the Canon G9,an upscale compact camera, I am thrilled with what a small difference of a couple of hundred of dollars can do with not only image quality but operation and features as well. You would really have to be a pro photographer to need anything else. The Canon Xsi was purchased after a few months of research of all SLR cameras in this price range with image quality being the primary consideration.

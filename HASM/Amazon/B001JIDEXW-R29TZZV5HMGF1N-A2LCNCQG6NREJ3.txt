Title: Great device, but has some quirks
Content:
I've been using my Sansa Clip for over a month and have been fairly happy with it.  The unit itself is great, sound quality is impressive, controls are easy to use, and the screen is very bright and easy to use.
My only gripe is the lack of instructions that come with the unit.  While it's a breeze to copy mp3 files to it, there is no word on how to set up a playlist included with the packaging.  There's some instructions on the Sansa Clip website but only after you dive through a bunch of pages, and it's a pain because you have to syncronize through Windows Media Player (I personally hate WMP).  It would be a lot nicer to have a printed instruction sheet in front of you instead of having to flip back and forth between a webpage and a program.

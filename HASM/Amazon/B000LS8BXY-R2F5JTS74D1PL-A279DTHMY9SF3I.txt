Title: Best space heater I have ever owned
Content:
I put this heater in my daughter's bedroom in December 2006.  It keeps her room heated throughout at a consistent temperature in the cold months.  The unit is never hot to the touch and uses little electricity.  Our pets love to lay right next to it on a cold day.  I have always been a little nervous about the burn and fire hazards associated with space heaters, but feel perfectly safe with this one. Steady on it's feet, also - with all the activity, I would have expected it to get tipped over a few times by now, but it hasn't.  I am getting ready to order another for the living room.

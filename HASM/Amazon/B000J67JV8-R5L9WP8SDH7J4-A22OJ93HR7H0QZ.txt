Title: Absolutely Amazing
Content:
I purchased this at home depot for $115 on clearance.  After using it I could honestly say that I would justify paying $250 for the vacuum because it is absolutely amazing.  My first use was during a move, where I needed to clean my old apartment in order to get my security deposit back.  It worked wonders on the floors getting all the cat hair up.  Also there is a button to stop the brush from spinning which really helps on hard surfaces (my old vacuum would just bat the dust and debris around and never really pick anything up)  The accessories are also very high quality.  The crevice brush can pick up anything out of the space between the carpet and the walls,  and the brush with extension is great for spider webs and dust bunnies.  Overall I love this vacuum,  having no experience with the dyson I could not make an objective comparison,  but I can say that I would not trade this vacuum in for any other.

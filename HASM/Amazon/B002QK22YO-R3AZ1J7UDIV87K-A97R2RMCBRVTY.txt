Title: Finally a netbook with a non-glossy screen
Content:
One of our departments just bought a few of these and this is the first netbook I encountered without a glossy screen.  Until now, many consumer laptops and all netbooks were on my you-know-what-list because of their highly reflective screens that make them look fancy, but also make them practically unusable in high light, and/or when you have a source of light behind you.  Kudos to HP for saving people's eyes.

Title: Small Size - Big Features
Content:
For such a small mp3 player, it is certainly packed with alot of extra features - including games, calendar, address book, stop watch, alarm, world clock and more.
With 2 GB of storage, you can store around 500 songs and alot of photos. You can even view your photos as a slideshow, complete with transitions. The click-wheel is intuitive and easy to use. 
Battery-life has been improved (up to 24-hour playback now) from the 1st Generation Nanos and there is a handy on-screen battery indicator.
The all-aluminum body feels solid in your hand and does not get scratched easily.

Title: Looks Nice But ...
Content:
My wife and I run an Internet cafe, and we bought two Cuisinarts to back up our Bunn coffee maker.
While the Cuisinarts look beautiful and make good coffee, it's never hot enough - not even to begin with, and a half hour later we may as well have unplugged it. Even on the hot setting, the Cuisinarts won't keep coffee hot.
For that reason alone, I'd never buy another one and don't recommend them.

Title: Awesome camera--Go ahead and upgrade if you already have an older Rebel
Content:
I learned the craft on a Digital Rebel XT.  I wanted the camera, but was wondering if it was really worth upgrading if I already owned a Rebel(should I just wait until I was ready for one of the professional Canon SLR's, and skip this?).  IT WAS SO WORTH IT TO UPGRADE!  The things you will enjoy are a MUCH improved LCD. You will never want to use the old Rebel again b/c you will say how did I ever struggle to review pictures on that tiny screen.  Also, the extra ISO settings, and the fact the noise reduction is so good you can shoot at ISO 3200 all day and not mind the noise, but on the Rebel XT you would try not to shoot above ISO 400.  Also, the controls are so much easier to set, understand, and use. If you are like me, an owner of an older Rebel who became a good photographer on it, but not a professional yet, and don't know if you need or deserve this upgrade...YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU DID!

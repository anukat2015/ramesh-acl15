This is my 2nd DSLR I'm very happy with this product.  I have not  ventured into mannual settings yet. I'm pleased with the ease of use and ease of the super steady shot feature.  I mainly wanted to to catch sports action shots which I have done, even in low lit gymnasiums.Sony Alpha DSLRA350X 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Super SteadyShot Image Stabilization with DT 18-70mm f/3.5-5.6 & DT 55-200mm f/4-5.6 Zoom Lenses

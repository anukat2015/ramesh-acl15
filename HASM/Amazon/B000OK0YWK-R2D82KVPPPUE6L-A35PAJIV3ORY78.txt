Title: not so good
Content:
Most mac users probably won't be buying a Zune, but I thought the price was good and I wanted to try something new. Of course I knew it didn't play well with mac os, but I had Vista installed on my mac, so I figured it would work fine with that. It did work, but it took me a long time to get it working and get my music on it. Once I had my music transfered, it did a fine job of playing music, but the interface was not the best I have seen. I would prefer the sansa one over the zune interface. The wireless transfer thing turned out to be a flop for me since I only know one person with a zune, and we couldn't get it to work anyways. Pretty much, I felt like I was stuck with a huge 30gb mp3 player. Yea, music worked fine, but I was expecting more. I'm trying to return it, and now I'm gonna get a sansa. If that thing flops I will go back to an iPod.

Title: I love this brewer!
Content:
I am now a proud owner of the Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System. I saw this presented at first on one of the home shopping channels and thought it was looked really cool. I did some research first for reviews, since I have learned that if something looks to good to be true, it usually is! I was pleased to see the reviews were positive and was convinced enough by these reviews to take the plunge and purchase it. I search around the internet and of course found that Amazon had the best price (surprise, surprise!). 
I received this last week and I am actually thoroughly impressed. It was extremely easy to set up and in no time at all I was brewing my first cup. The situation in my home is that we all love coffee, but of course we all love different brews. I am more a mild to medium blend girl, whereas my hubby is a bold to extra bold type of guy. My daughter follows in my footsteps with a flavored coffee thrown in for kicks. This is what finally sold me on this. We can actually brew a cup to our liking at will! Start to finish is less than a minute and you never have the coffee drips on your counter from the pot. The K-Cups that I purchased are of a satisfactory taste. I want to explore some of the other brands before I comment on those. I will definitely purchase the K-Cup filter so I can brew my own coffee from the local coffee roaster. This brewing is convenient, easy to use and nothing to clean up. I highly recommend it is you are a die-hard coffee drinker!

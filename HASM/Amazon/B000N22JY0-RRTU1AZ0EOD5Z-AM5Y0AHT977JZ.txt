Title: fairly quiet ceramic heater
Content:
this was the third of the heater fans I tried out. I like the thermostat feature. people need to be aware that the thermocouple(or temperature sensing indicator)is inside these small retail heaters. therefore, its trying to read ambient temperature while its trying to heat up or go to a set point you put in. ideally, the thermostat would be in the room somewhere away from the heater,(like your house thermostat for your furnace-yes, did you know where you key in your room temperature also senses the present, ambient air temperature for your home?)and you would see a more stable temperature output, initially. You shouldn't run off to return it because of this seemingly erratic readout, it is not broken or no good. give it a chance.
So far I am happy with the low level of sound from the fan, it is not annoying like some jet engine, and I am able to sleep thru it when it kicks on. I like its slim size for when I go to cabins and need a heater that will turn off at a set point, unlike those old heaters that run until you get so hot you wake up and have to turn them off in most cabins! so I gave it 4 only because I am looking for silence, and its close. Oh, it has two settings, the 1500watt and the 900 watt and the fan is the same speed on both. in the automatic mode(set temperature) it only runs on the 1500 watt. I think these are the correct wattages, but there is a hi and low wattage setting.

Title: Pleased Nikon snob!  GREAT CAMERA!
Content:
I have been dying to get a Nikon digital for a few years now.  I was taught much of my skills on a 35mm N2000 (used fully manual) and was not dissapointed with the D50.  Gives you great flexiblity, is easy to use, and is excellent for just about any skill level out there.  Can function as simply as a point and shoot, but allows full flexiblity of f stops, shutter speed and ISO.  Lightweight and comfortable for my little, barely non-childsized hands!  I would recommend for a beginner or someone how wants to play around a bit, but do yourself a favor and get photoshop elements too.  Talk about the ideal pakage!

Title: An absolutely wonderful machine
Content:
Disclaimer:  I am not an "Apple Worshipper"  There are many things that Apple does that I find annoying or worse.  
The previous Apple I worked with was a Powerbook G4 15", which had served fairly well for the past four years.  I've always thought that the quality of the Apple Powerbook was superior to what I could get (as a primarily PC user).
Fast forward, and the user in our company needs a new computer to be able to run the latest Adobe design products.  So let me go over the noticeable differences:
1 - Fast.  Even compared to other modern dual core notebooks.  This computer rockets along.
2 - Smaller.  This new machine is thinner and lighter compared to the old Powerbook G4's.  It wasn't something we were expecting and the end user was quite thrilled.
3 - Better power cord.  The magsafe connector is a WONDERFUL upgrade from those G4 power cords that had a lifespan of about 6 months.  While some people have reported problems with them, the power cord that ships with this model is "version 2" and after a couple of month's use has shown zero issues.
Once again, I believe that the Macbook Pro has shown itself to be a well engineered, solid machine.  Amazon has amazing next-day-air shipping rates on this model, and it does everything that we need it to.  I believe that Apple has stayed ahead of the pack when it comes to quality construction in their notebooks.  Even better, our user was instantly comfortable with the new version and up and running in next to no time.

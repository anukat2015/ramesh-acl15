Title: Quirky, But A Very Attractive, Functional Coffee Maker
Content:
This machine functions. Enthusiastically. I'm really happy with how quickly it operates. It's also a very striking coffee maker. The timer and clock, on/off button are very no-nonsense, with no learning curve, which I love, plus the water level is clearly visible. It is, however, really noisy towards the end of the brew cycle.  The carafe fits extra snugly in the coffee maker housing; it takes slight practice to place it smoothly. It also has a heavy plastic feel and is a matte copper -color- only. I hope I'm paying a bit more for mechanical quality, because the exterior materials don't really reflect the price point. Still, overall, this machine goes great with my other copper countertop small appliances, is a very attractive machine, and functions exceptionally well.  It's definitely a keeper, although I feel I'm definitely paying more for the couple extra cups of capacity plus the unusual look of this coffeemaker.

Title: Highly recommend - great laptop for the price
Content:
Many of my thoughts are covered in previous positive posts, so here's a summary:
Pros:
--Speed (processor/memory are great for the price)
--Start up/shut down is extremely fast compared to my XP desktop
--Backlit keyboard is great (and does not cause excessive heat).  This feature is only on the A505-S6040 model.  You pay extra for this and 2GB more RAM, and if you can afford it, do it.
--Laptop stays rather cool.  I don't use a cooling fan when I use it;  my work computer could fry an egg.
--I use the number keypad all the time, so I find that as a huge plus on a laptop.  
--Lots of ports
Cons:
--Loves to collect fingerprints
--No Blu Ray Drive
--No Bluetooth (although I personally don't care, this is typically in comparable models)
Nice "Surprise":
--Speakers are especially clear for a laptop (but not as loud as I would like)
--Windows 7 has some features in it that save you some time/frustration, which I find more helpful for work-related purposes
--Mahjong...sweet sweet mahjong

Title: OK til the wheel fell off (10 minutes)
Content:
The extreme discount and cool design temped me to order this despite highly variable reviews.
It arrived fast, well packed, and looks great. However........
On first powering up I could feel that the left wheel did not spin freely, causing a lot of unnecessary extra effort to push it across the floor.  Then, after 10 minutes of vacuuming the right wheel, fell off!   
A google search showed this to be a common problem with this model.  The posters suggest carefully prying off the hub caps with a butter knife, then using a hex wrench slightly loosening the left wheel, and tightening the right one, and backing off 1/8 turn to allow for free motion.
Fine, but every 10 minutes the wheel fell off again.  The retaining screw is TINY, and hard metal into nylon.  Very poor design. 
The Good: the suction is fine, both on floors and carpet. It looks great and collapses.
The Bad: There are several parts of the design that cause vacuuming a room to take much more time than it should:
1. The cord IS much shorter than average, so you have to frequently re-plug, even in my one bedroom apt.
2. The suction path is about 1/3 shorter than my Eureka Boss, so you have to make more trips. 
3. The bag holds about 1/6th as much as a Eureka Boss...they are not expensive,($1.25 each) but you will go through them VERY fast.
4. The long wheelbase means you cannot make quick turns to get into corners, I had to go back with a hand vac to get them.
With all of that, maybe 3 stars if it worked.  The wheels cost $14 each plus shipping and handling once the warrantee is over, and I am not convinced they will not break constantly.

Title: Cleans like a pro!
Content:
PROS: The amount of dirt and pet hair this vacuum picks up is amazing. I vacuumed two rooms and two large rugs and emptied several canisters of dirt. GROSS. This is by far the best vacuum I have ever had (I am 39). My area rugs which are 5-9 years old look brand new after using this beast. I never realized how dirty they remained after vacuuming with my old Hoover. The attachments cleaned my couch pillows extremely well. The vaccum is not too heavy and it feels like it glides when using. Anyone who trashes this vacuum must have stock in a competitor's company.
CONS: I would give this vacuum 5 stars if it were made of sturdier pieces. One piece in particular keeps falling off while using. Maybe I got a lemon piece; its easy to pull the electrical plug out of the wall sucket because it only has two prongs, not three. So, pay attention. Also, when using attachments, leave vacuum off capreted area because the vacuum brush still rolls...FINALLY, it is true that you will get dust on you when emptying the canister. But, that is a small price to pay for having AMAZINGLY CLEAN carpets. I wish I had bought this ealier.

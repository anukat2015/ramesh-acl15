Title: Piece of Junk
Content:
This heater worked fine for about 3 months and then just stopped working - no indication as to the problem - it just stopped working at all - a waste of money if you are looking for something reliable for the long term.  I've had similar heaters for more than 15 years that are still operating fine - this "ComforTemo Technology" is not highly reliable.

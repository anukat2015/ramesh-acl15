Title: poor music management
Content:
If you like to listen to music from your new CDs and cut the songs you don't like as you go, Forget it. There is no "delete this song ?" option
on this player. If a song is playing and you hit the option button. The options you get are "now playing" pops up right above the title of the song that is now playing. Or, "Detailed Imformation" wich pretty much tells you the length of the song you hate and wish you could erase.

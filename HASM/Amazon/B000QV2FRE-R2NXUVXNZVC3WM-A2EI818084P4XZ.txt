Title: Excellent Heater
Content:
This is an excellent heater for anyone who can provide a 20 amp 210-240 volt power outlet for it. We use the same outlet that supplies our 220 v. air conditioner in the summer months. We set it on Auto so the fan cycles off with the heat when the room temperature reaches our setting. It has a thermal cutoff safety switch that works as it should and cuts off the power if the unit should overheat, such as from a piece of fabric cutting off the air flow. This QPH4A is our basic heat source for one floor of a small house and it really does the job when it's cold outside. The heater is compact and unobtrusive and the best feature in comparison to other heaters in its class is that it is very quiet -- no rattling and wheezing, just a soft woosh of warm air.

Title: Perfect Heater for a bedroom
Content:
I investigated many, many heaters before purchasing this one. Yes, one has to "burn off" the heater on high for a couple of hours to remove the smell, but after that, it works perfectly without any odor.
I use it in my bedroom and after setting the thermostat, the heater keeps the room at exactly the temperature I want, completely silently. A perfect heater.
Postscript: after using the heater last winter, I can say that it performed  perfectly. It kept my bedroom warm at almost the lowest setting. I would recommend it to anyone.

Title: Best Basic DSLR Kit
Content:
As a parent of two rapidly growing children, I was getting frustrated with my point and shoot cameras slow shutter lag; causing me to miss those never-to-be-seen-again picture moments. So I decided to get myself an entry level DSLR.  After talking with friends, researching the internet and a recent Consumers Report review of DSLRs, I decided that the XSi was just the camera to get me started.
I have been truly amazed at the quality of the pictures I have been taking using its automatic settings. Fast Shutter Speed and Continuous shooting almost guarantees I will never miss memorable moments again. Battery life is really impressive as Ive taken hundreds of pictures on one charge.  Even though I am still experimenting with all the automatic and manual settings, the included manual really helps in explaining all the settings and how to use them. For a novice like myself, the information provided is clear and easy to understand. The included lens features Auto-Focus and Image Stabilization and is pretty decent for a starter lens. Interchangeable lenses make these DSLRs very versatile in any shooting condition. 
Now my review is not as detailed as others have posted here because I'm nowhere near a skilled photographer, but I hope to help others who are thinking about getting into DSLR picture taking like I have. I am really enjoying this camera's features and abilities. It's very easy to use on its basic automatic settings and even more fun playing with its manual ones.  
If your looking for the perfect camera to start off, please give this one a chance. You wont find a better starter kit than whats being offered at this price range.

Title: mixed experience
Content:
I bought this header a couple years ago and use it constantly as a fan in summer and heater in the winter.  Overall I like it -- works well, not very noisy, stable design.  Recently, it started failing to shut off when I turn it off.  I have to unplug it, which isn't that difficult, but now I'm leery of the failsafe, which is one of the features I was interested in since I have a cat and the heater could possibly be tipped over.  Still using it though, I just took it to work where my cat does not go.

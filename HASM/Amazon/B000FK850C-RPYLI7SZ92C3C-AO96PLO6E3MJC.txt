Title: Cold Feet Warm Heart
Content:
Every winter my 91-year old Mother spends a month with me, and it is very difficult to keep her cozy in my home.  By the time she feels warm enough, I am wilting, and the bill for my central heating goes through the roof.  Last winter I purchased the SPT tower heater in the hope that it would heat the room she was currently in.  I have high ceilings and a lot of windows but, as I moved the heater from room to room with Mom, it succeeded in rapidly raising the temperature to her comfort level. The unit is quiet, it seems to evenly spread its heat throughout the room, and the remote control turned out to be quite handy. I wasn't sure whether the portable heater would raise or lower my utility bill, but I was definitely pleased to be able to keep Mom perfectly comfortable.  I was so pleased that after Mom left I turned down the central heat and continued to use the portable heater at my own comfort level, moving it from bedroom to office.  My utility bills are 5-month-averaged, and I'm happy to report that this heater contributed greatly to reducing my 5-month-average by $30 per month!  I have just ordered an additional one for added convenience.  The heater is a very lightweight plastic, and I was concerned that it would be flimsy, but we didn't experience any problems at all.

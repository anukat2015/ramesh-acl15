Title: Great, with 3 flaws
Content:
I am very happy with this coffeemaker, and am able to make my one cup of coffee a day. I use natural colored #1 filters, and that makes cleanup simple.  I have 3 complaints, but am happy overall.
1. The dripper continues to drip once the coffee is finished. It drips after you take the cup out (no matter how long the cup is left there) and then it even drips after I take out the used filter to throw away. So, trying to keep away the coffee stains is not really possible, and it makes this a bit messy.
2. You have to fill you coffee cup with water and then pour into the tank. It is almost impossible to do this without spilling a little water down the side of the cup, which leaves you with a wet counter. Also, leaves a little remnant water in the cup.
3. It does not fit any cup taller than the normal cup size. Sometimes I would prefer a slightly larger cup, but it will not fit the cup under the dripper, and it will not hold enough water to fill it up.

Content:
This is, hands down, the best vacuum (of any kind) I have ever used (and I'm over 50!)  It's easy to assemble even for the "directionally challenged", easy to push because you are only pushing the handle part and not the whole vacuum, light to carry, and it has very powerful suction.  I also find it much easier to clean carpeted stairs, and it performs well on hard surfaces too. It's a breeze to clean, but the dirt cup is a little small (no big deal.)  I can't believe how easily this picks up everything, including microscopic craft glitter and cat hair. I always research everything in great detail before I make a purchase (because I hate to throw money away), and this product lives up to all my expectations.

Title: ripped off
Content:
As a high school student who never owned a laptop before, I was craving for one badly. I knew little about laptops and bought this crappy laptop for $1000. Recently I realized it only had 1gb. Even when I first bought it the laptop refused to run computer games and would always crash. I didn't use the laptop much until a year later when I went to college. It was then that I started having major complications. The fan was REALLY loud and even though my disk space is not even half full the laptop runs super slow. Now there's always a lag when I type and watch movies. Not to mention the fan just won't stop making its annoying sounds. Also, I can't use the internet for more than an hour without it freezing up. It's so slow it's unbearable. I'm already looking for a new laptop. Don't buy this laptop!

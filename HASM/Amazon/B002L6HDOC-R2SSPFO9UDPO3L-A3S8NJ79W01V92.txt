Title: Gen IV iPod
Content:
I'm glad I decided to upgrade to the Gen X iPod at the last minute. It was well worth the extra $30. The camera is one of the best features. I bought it to primarily use in my car, and to eliminate carrying a ton of CD's. The 8mb is more than enough for my use for now. The iPod holds all of my CD's and room left for more music DL's. I figure by the time I need more mb's they'll have the Gen XI. A note of caution...Amazon offers links to accessories at the bottom of the selection page which I think is great, but when I ordered the Gen X iPod, the quick link I added to my cart on their recommendation was for a Gen IV case, which did not fit. The Gen X looks the same, but the control center has moved an 1/8" of an inch. When I called Amazon, they were unaware of this error. Make sure your accessories are for the model device you are buying.

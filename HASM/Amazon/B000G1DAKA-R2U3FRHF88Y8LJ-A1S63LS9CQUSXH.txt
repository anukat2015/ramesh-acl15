Title: Worth it
Content:
I own a pentax zx 30 35 mm camera with a 28mm-210mm lens on it. I was shopping a while for a digital camera, bought the canon powershot a620.But sold it after 4 weeks, I feel more natural with a SLR style than the point and shoot camera.Finally after much research, landed on this one, knowing very well that there are superior cameras out there in the market.And I never needed a camera in 8MP - 10MP range. 4 MP - 6MP is all (my opinion) one needs for prints of 4 x 6 sizes.
 For me, this camera is worth every penny spent, I truly admire the simplicity of this camera. Picture quality was very good ( I ususally do outdoor photography) and most importantly I was able to use my 28mm- 210 mm lenses on this one with absolutely no hassel.
Just one minor botheration, the battery cover was little flimsy, but no big deal. I found similar issues with very popular brands out there too.
If you want a camera for outdoor photography and you are just starting out with a limited budget into DSLR's, I would recommend to take a look at this one. You won't be disappointed.

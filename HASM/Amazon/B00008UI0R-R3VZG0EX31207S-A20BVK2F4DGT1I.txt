Title: Another winner!
Content:
Wow, either the other vacuum was not very good or this one is terrific. It's picking up fibers from the carpets that the other cleaner obviously missed. I also like the fact that the stuff visibly swirls as you clean. A visual that makes the work of vacuuming more fun. Cleaning the filter is not so much fun, but when you see all the stuff this baby pulls from your carpets, you'll wonder how you ever did without it. Very good on my hardwood floors as well. Highly recommend!

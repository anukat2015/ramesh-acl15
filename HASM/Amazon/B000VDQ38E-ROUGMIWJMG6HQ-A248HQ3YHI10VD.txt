Title: Great at first, overall a frustrating disappointment.
Content:
We have a suede couch and had recently gotten a dog. Decided it was time to get a vacuum with decent upholstery attachments...Got this thing home, I was initially impressed with it. The attachments worked well for what I needed them for, had good suction etc....The next time I used it, not so good.   Really if you want to maintain optimal use on a bag-less vacuum you should free the beater bar of any tangly hair and thoroughly clean the filters each time.  I do this after each use...by the 5th use of this thing, something had burned through the belt and melted rubber all over my carpet... Okay, so i replace the belt, turn it on and the same thing happens, the little part you hook the belt on was getting way too hot and burning through the belts!  I wasn't missing any parts or anything!
I ended up taking this vacuum back, they told me that they had received an inordinate amount of returns on this model for various reasons, and honored my return even though I was past their return policy time-frame!
Pros 
*Has decent suction at first and you can see what you're getting up
*Cool attachments
*I liked the sensor on there that tells you if you have a clog or blockage
*Long cord
*Easy assembly
*Wide path, very nice
Cons
-Heavier than necessary
-Loud as all hell (I know it's a vacuum, but still, ridiculous)
-Does not edge well, you will ALWAYS need to use the attachments where baseboards and furniture legs are concerned
-The unit gets REALLY dirty on the outside of itself, not sure if it was blowing the dust around but the dirt even after 5 uses was just THICK all over it.
-Apparently not designed for long term light duty work... Seriously, my place is only 1200 square feet, the dog barely shed when we had him and I take care of my things... What gives?! 
Vacuums are expensive these days, I won't risk buying another bissell upright.

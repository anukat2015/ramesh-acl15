Title: Good package, glossy screen
Content:
I've owned the Lenovo u33o for about 48 hours.  I am pleased so far.  The computer is light, the keyboard has that soft durable feel of the Thinkpad line (although this is the consumer oriented Ideapad line).  The switchable graphics works as advertised making switching graphics a five second process.  Refreshingly little bloatware, dolby home theater speakers make for a lush full sound.  The CPU is peppy and the styling is classy and understated.
Let's talk negatives:  The screen is very glossy.  I am backlit as I am writing this review and I can almost see my room like a review mirror.  Also, although the sound is full, it is not especially loud, just average.  The laptop is warm, warmer than normal.
Lastly, the screen is noticeably washed out at default settings.  The user must turn the contrast and gamma down to make print legible on websites.  This is a reoccurring gripe of users that I learned after purchase.  After modifications, the contrast is livable, but not as crisp as I would like on a mid-range laptop.
Overall, I am happy with the product and recommend with the reservations about the glossy screen and washed out color.

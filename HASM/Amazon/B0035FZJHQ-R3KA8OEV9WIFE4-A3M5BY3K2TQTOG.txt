Title: Save some money amatures! Buy this instead of the 7D.
Content:
This camera has it all. You want video, you got it. You want great still's, you got it. You want a easy to use SLR right out of the box, you have that too. Lets face it, this camera can replace a camcorder and all works on SDHC! This is impressive and very inexpense if you put the video and pictures together the way this product does. Dont waste you money on the 7D unless you are a professional. This camera can give you everything you can ask for and more!

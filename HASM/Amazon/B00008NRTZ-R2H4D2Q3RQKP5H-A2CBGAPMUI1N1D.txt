Title: Bissell 6900 Digipro Canister Vacuum
Content:
I purchased this vacuum 5 months ago and it already is giving me trouble.  The hose attachment to the canister does not stay attached and it does not have a floor brush making it difficult to vacuum around furniture.  I would not recommend buying this vacuum.  It is cheap plastic and I wasted my money.

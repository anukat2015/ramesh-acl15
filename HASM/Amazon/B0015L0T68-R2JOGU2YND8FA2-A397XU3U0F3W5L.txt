Title: Awesome Player
Content:
I had a Sansa e250 that broke after much use so I bought a Fuze because of Sandisk's usability. I like the fact that you can toggle the Play/Pause right from the main menu. The jog dial is steady and the buttons are very responsive. It uses my 2gb microSD card perfectly and I can easily drag and drop my music onto it.
I recommend this player to anyone who wants quality sound at a good price while not being worried about fitting their whole music library on the device.

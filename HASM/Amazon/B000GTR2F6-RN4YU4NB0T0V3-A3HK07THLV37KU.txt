Title: Really Good Coffee...But It Broke Within A Month
Content:
I absolutely LOVE this coffee maker. It's quick and easy to make a cup. It looks stylish. Only thing is it broke after a month. The machine automatically shuts itself off now as it's finishing making a cup. Good news is Keurig is very responsive and they're sending me a new one. Fingers crossed for better luck this time. Only other complaint would be the coffee doesn't get hot enough. Even at the highest temperature, it cools down very quickly so you have to drink up quick. All this said, I'd still buy it all over again. Great convenience (when it works) and good tasting coffee.
UPDATE: While Keurig did send me a replacement machine, it was also shutting itself off within a week. The phone rep actually admitted they had a bad batch of machines and were trying to rectify the issue. I had to downgrade the review here since this is clearly a defective product. It's quite unfortunate considering the price.

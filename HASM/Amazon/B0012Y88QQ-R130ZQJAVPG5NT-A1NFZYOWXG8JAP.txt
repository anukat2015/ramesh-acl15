Title: Move Up in Consumer DSLR Performance
Content:
After two very happy years using the CANON 350D/XT DSLR, I decided to upgrade to the XSi/450D based on 1) Addition of more professional-level spot metering/focusing offering, 2) Increase to 12 MP resolution and 3) The improved standard IS 18-55 kit lens.  In all regards, I'm exceptionally pleased with the new Canon.  I was able to tell the kit lens improvement and the impact of Image Stabilization from the first time I used it, as it allows me to work in lower light and delivers clearer photograhs in every situation.  The spot metering works very well, as does the increase in point-of-focus.  I can definately see the increased resolution in my cropped enlargements, as well.  The one feature I don't use (live view) could be a big 'plus' to people who prefer not to use viewfinders, but again, it's not something I use.  Battery life (I use an external 430EX flash for most shots) has been far-above Canon's listed number; I often get over 800 shots on a battery using AF and IS.  I've used the camera with my Sigma DC and DG lenses with no problems noted at all, although my Sunpak flash that works perfectly TTL with the 350D will not function with the XSi.

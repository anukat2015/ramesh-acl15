Title: Goodbye Tassimo.....Hello Keurig
Content:
Insignificant facts: Husband and wife are both accountants. Drink lots of coffee this time of year. Ok all times of year. Own a hardlined commercial Bunn, Tassimo and now Keurig 70, and some kind of cappuccino machine (put away in attic due to insufficient interest in cleaning).  This comparison is obviously Keurig 70 to Tassimo as the Bunn is in a dimension all its own for different coffee desires
Pros:  Fast! Coffee, tea, hot chocolate
       Not as noisy as Tassimo
       Makes full cups (no more holding the button in to fill cup 
         compromising taste from the Tassimo).  Additionally, Tassimo
         takes longer to "recover" from adding that extra amount into
         your cup, hence, delaying readiness time for next cup
       Larger selection of items (intend to use the "fill your own"
         filter, laziness will probably overcome that). Tassimo STILL
         hasn't offered a comprehensive enough variety years later to
         rival Keurig.
       Temperature adjustment very nice feature for those of us who 
         like HOT coffee
       Faster ready time than Tassimo for that first cup 
Cons:  No cappuccino (husband not so thrilled about that)
       Leaves a larger carbon footprint as the K-cups are substantially
         larger than the Tassimo t-cups (though that could be alleviated
         by making your own)
Only owned Keurig a short while, but have experienced less pod "blowouts" of grinds and tea leaves in cup than the Tassimo.  Will see if that changes as it gets older.

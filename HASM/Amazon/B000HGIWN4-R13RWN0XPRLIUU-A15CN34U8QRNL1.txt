Title: Superb in every way
Content:
I bought the Nikon 80 with the 18-135mm AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor lens for my daughter's college graduation gift.  She loves it and has put it to very good use in only a week.  The lens is perfect as a starter for this camera ("Awesome" to quote her). The professional photographers where she works were also impressed.
Beware of some of the "deals" you see offered at online stores and auction sites.  Research revealed the following problems:
1. Online stores with very bad ratings - they try to shake you down for more money after the order is submitted.
2. "Grey Market" cameras that were improperly imported and come with Japanese manuals.
3. Kits that bundle non-Nikon lenses (Sigma, Tamron).  These work but they are of lower quality and cost than the Nikon lenses.
4. Kits that bundle Nikon lenses that are not the AF-S DX lenses designed especially by Nikon for their digital SLRs. 
After looking at the whole picture, Amazon with my Prime shipping was the best deal.
Now my only problem is that I want one, too!

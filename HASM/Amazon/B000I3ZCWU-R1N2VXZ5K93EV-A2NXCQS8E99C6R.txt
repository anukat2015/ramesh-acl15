Title: You can't beat the image quality
Content:
I've considered other, higher priced digital SLRs, such as the Nikon D80 and Canon 30D.  However, I decided that I probably won't be using some of the more advanced features offered by those cameras, and would rather spend the money saved on a better lens.  In terms of picture quality, all these SLRs are capable of equivalent quality.
Currently I have 3 lenses, the kit 18-55mm, the 50mm f/1.8, and the 85mm f/1.8.  I don't use the kit zoom lens anymore because I favor the faster, prime lenses.  I mostly take pictures of my children, and the 85mm f/1.8 is an excellent portrait lens.  It is sharp, fast, and produces beautiful background blur.  Zoom lenses unfortunately are not as sharp or fast, unless you're willing to pay much more than the cost of the camera body.
I think all novice SLR owners should buy the cheap Canon 50mm f/1.8, to discover what a fast lens can do when you set the aperture to 1.8, and take some portraits.  You too can have professional-looking results!

Title: Very disappointing
Content:
The only thing we like about this coffeemaker is that the carafe has a wide spout which causes less dripping.  But we like our coffee HOT and this coffeemaker only keeps the coffee barely warm.  We have to make the coffee and then put the cups in the microwave to have HOT coffee.  I just ordered a Mr. Coffee that was the same model I had before because it has an adjustable hot plate.  I won't even donate this Black and Decker.

Title: Pet owners Beware!!!!
Content:
We've had this vacuum for about a year and it is worthless. When we first tried it out, it seemed like a fine vacuum, but it soon became a nightmare! As far as pet hair goes, during vacuuming, we'd have to stop every few minutes to unclog the filter. The pet attachment never really worked. Pet hair would get caught in the bristles and it wouldn't spin. The only way to get it to work again was to stick my fingers in there and pull all the hair out and then spin it manually. The part that detaches from the main vacuum is convenient, but over time, it became difficult to reattach it to the vacuum. It has lost almost ALL of it's suction and we find ourselves having to clean out the tubing manually in order for it to work. The final straw was over Christmas when we were cleaning up tree needles. The vacuum got clogged and hasn't worked properly since. We are now shopping for a new vacuum. I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone, especially pet owners. Our dogs hair kicked this vacuum's butt!

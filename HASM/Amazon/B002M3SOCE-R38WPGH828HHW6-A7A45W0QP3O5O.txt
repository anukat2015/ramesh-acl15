Title: Blew my mind right off the box!
Content:
I got mine 3 days ago! (8GB version, supposedly? 3rd gen.). I can Not let it go off my hands, literally! It's Soooooo amazingly addictive! Truth to be told - I've never liked Apple and everything what has to do with it!!! This is my first iPod touch EVER in my life, so is any of Apple products. The only ONE reason I bought it, was its apps. (~ 85,000 and counting!) Just to be clear, it never meant to be for my MP3's, games or videos/movies (for me, the best MP3 player's always been Sony NWZ-A818, gaming... well yeah, maybe, someday, but for videos - hell NO! You gotta be an idiot to watch good videos/movies on portable devices, like that one or any other else. That's why we've created Big A$$ TV's, PC's, Sony PS, Xbox and DVD players!). First impressions are: very elegant, sturdy, well-built, flawless hook-ups, simple interface and ease of use, wi-fi connectivity, snappy downloading ability, excellent screen resolution and touch response! Very pleased!!! I've already downloaded about 12 free apps - all work just fine, can't complain! Processor speed gotta be higher (up to 50%) on 32GB & 64GB models, but I can't tell. So far, so good for me. So, thank you Amazon for your service (as usual, the Best on Planet!), and all you guys out there, give it a shot, you won't be disappointed! Let me know, if you find new cool apps for that baby!

Title: Perfect small bathroom heater
Content:
I own two of these, one in a small bathroom, and one in a larger 9' X 9' bathroom. 
The unit is compact; it has a plastic part that you fasten into the wall, and then the heater rotates sideways to fit into it, then back to vertical to lock in place.
The controls have a power button, a LOW button, a HIGH button, and several temperature settings. We don't use the temperature settings, so I won't comment on them here. The heater works great in both locations; the small bathroom uses low heat and the larger bathroom uses high heat.
One needs to be aware that when powering off the unit, you have to hold the button; the lights will change (clockwise), but the next time you power on the unit, the last setting you used will be set. In other words, if you have the unit on HIGH and you PRESS the power button, it will go to LOW heat. In the same situation if you HOLD the power button, the light will indicate LOW heat for a second before the unit turns off, but the next time you power up it will be in HIGH heat.
The unit has an overtemp circuit - if it gets too hot it will shut down and it requires a lot of time to completely cool before it will allow a power up. We discovered this when we attempted HIGH heat in our smaller bathroom - but now we save energy by using the LOW setting, so it was a good experience.
The unit also has an ALCI plug, which means that if you drop it in the tub or just generally get it wet, the unit will disconnect from the mains and is not hazardous - the plug will simply blow it's circuit and the unit shuts down. This is perfect for bathrooms.
Excellent unit, great operation, nice design. Recommended.

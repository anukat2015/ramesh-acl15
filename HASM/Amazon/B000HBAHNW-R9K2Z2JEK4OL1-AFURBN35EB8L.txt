Title: Average vacuum at astronomical price
Content:
After paying nearly $900 for what was supposedly the best filtration system for a family with allergies, I expected a high performance and reliable product. Unfortunately like my German cars, it suffered from detail issues. The power heard was intermittent and try getting this fixed under warranty. It went to "Ze schopp" for a few months and came back to try again. Except the hose fell off. Yep, right at the canister body. "No problemo, looks like this was made to just snap in". And off. In. And off. Back to Ze Schopp. Meanwhile wife went to Walmart and bought a GE HEPA for $89. Sorry to say this the GE works just as well, is quieter, and well, it works while the Miele is getting a new CPU or something.

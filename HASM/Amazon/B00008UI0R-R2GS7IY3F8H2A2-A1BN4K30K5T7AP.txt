Title: I Like it
Content:
I really like this vacuum, its size and features are just what I wanted. I like being able to go from rug to floor in a push of a button to stop the rotators so that they don't shoot all the dirt all over the place. Bagless is wonderful. The extra utensils are Ok, small brush could be more fuller and softer. I can use my old utensils from my now dead Kenmore on this machine. The only thing that could use improvement is that the machine is so light that when I pull the cord out I have to put my foot on top of the canister to hold it down. Great suction power.

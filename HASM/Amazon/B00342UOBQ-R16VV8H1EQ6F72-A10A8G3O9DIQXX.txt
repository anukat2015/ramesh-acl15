Title: Gateway NV5937u Laptop - love it!
Content:
I love this laptop!  It has the hard drive capacity and processor strength of laptops that cost a LOT more.  I haven't had any problems at ALL.  It has run smoothly, and was very easy to set up and begin using.  The ONLY thing that I'm not crazy about is that the number pad on the keyboard is smaller than most laptops that have a number pad.  The number keys are smaller, and the decimal point is not at the bottom of the numbers, where it is SUPPOSED to be.... It is at the top.  So, that confuses me and will take quite a bit of getting used to.  Other than that, I have totally loved it!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone!

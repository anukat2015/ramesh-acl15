Title: Pretty nice
Content:
I had some problem with the touch pad at first. I adjusted the settings and got rid of most of it. (it was really jittery) It still comes and goes some times, but it's been pretty good mostly. The multitouch scroll is still a little jittery but it's usable. Also, the screen could use a better view angle.
I haven't had time to try any games but it's supposed to have a decent graphics card for this size computer. I liked that it still had a DVD drive in it too. Some of the Dells and HPs don't at this size and performance. It's nice and light too and has a VERY long battery life as it can switch off the powerful graphics card and go to a built in one to save power. 
I wish it had bluetooth but that's not a big thing. That's really about the only thing I'd almost expect it to have that it doesn't. 
Oh and it's got a good warranty built in. Dell would charge an arm and a leg for this type of warranty (accidental damage and such for something like 2 years I think)
All in all, if you are looking for best bang for the buck over the big name brands, this probably qualifies.

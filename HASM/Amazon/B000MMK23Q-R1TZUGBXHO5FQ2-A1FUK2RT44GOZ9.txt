Title: Luxury heater
Content:
This is a luxury heater!  It is for people who buys a BMW instead of a cheap car.  It is not to save you money.  If you want to save money, go buy any $30 heater at your local store.  I have used many different heaters: oil filled, ceramic, silent low profile, and this one.  They all produce the same amount of heat which is 5,000 btu.  Majority of the complaints for this heater is that they could have bought a cheaper heater.
Once you understand this is a luxury heater and it is not to save you money, then your expectation will be different.  Like all space heaters, it is not to replace your central heat or furnace.  It is design to only heat the room you are in, so that you don't have to heat the entire house.  This edenpure is no different.  Edenpure saves about 25% electricity compare to other space heaters because it doesn't need to use 1500watts constantly like most space heaters.  Still that doesn't cover the cost of the initial high price.
The benefit is that the heat does not lower the humidity and makes you feel dry.  I don't need to run another humidifier nearby.  It is safer for my kids and I can leave it running without worrying about starting a fire.  That's it, if the benefit is not worth $300+ to you, don't get this luxury heater.

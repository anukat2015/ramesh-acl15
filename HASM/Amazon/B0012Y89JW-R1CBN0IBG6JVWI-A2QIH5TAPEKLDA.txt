Title: Canon Rebel XSi
Content:
I've had this camera for over a month now, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  The XSi is very user-friendly (as long as you read the manual ;)), but I still encourage any potential buyers who are new to DSLR/SLR photography to do plenty of research before buying.
I printed some images taken with my XSi and am very pleased with the results.  The images made up a 14.25" x 11" calendar and they were very sharp and clear, unlike images taken with my parents' old Point & Shoot camera.  If you are coming from a Point & Shoot and frequently print images, you will notice a HUGE different in image quality and you will be very pleased with the change.
The live-view function can also be very useful if you do Macro photography.  When taking photos close to the ground, squatting down and viewing the image through live-view on the LCD screen is a nice alternative to laying on the ground to look through the viewfinder!
And those of you buying the camera with the kit lens, it's actually a decent purchase.  The new EF-S 18-55mm IS version is much better than the old non-IS version.
Great purchase, you won't be disappointed.

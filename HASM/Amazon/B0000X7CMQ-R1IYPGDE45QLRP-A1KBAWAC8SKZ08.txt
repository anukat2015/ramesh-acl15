Title: Ahh, more than satisfied!
Content:
I did a lot of research before settling on the Zojirushi EC-BD15 coffee maker. I am more than satisfied with the quality of the coffee it makes. The carafe works quite well my coffee stays hot for hours. I do take the time before brewing to place hot water in the carafe - only for the time it takes to fill the maker with water and get the grounds prepared - maybe this makes a difference in the heat retaining qualities of the carafe. I would highly recommend this coffee maker.

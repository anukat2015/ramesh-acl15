Title: Does the Job
Content:
We bought this vacuum for our bachelor son's birthday.  I recently helped him clean his house and used his new vacuum.  The canister is easy to maneuver and the power nozzle works very well.  It glides across hardwood floors easily, unlike other power nozzles.  Only negative is the two attachments; the brush and a strange little device with velcro strips.  Fortunately, we kept the attachments from his old machine and they fit the new one.  We believe this is an ideal vacuum for a bachelor who only cleans when the mood strikes!  Should last a long time.

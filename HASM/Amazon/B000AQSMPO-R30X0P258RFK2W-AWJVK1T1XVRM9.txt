Title: Good Product - Great Company
Content:
I rarely review products unless I feel strongly one way or the other about something.  A pure selection bias, I realize.
Not only is this a nice one-cup coffee maker, but I just have to give kudos to Keurig as a company.  Any time a company is manufacturing a product like this, we are kidding ourselves if we don't recognize that there is some small chance for a glitch, malfunction, etc.  
So, the question to me is not, is this product 100% guaranteed to work correctly...the question is, what does a company do in the rare instance that it does not.  
A few weeks after I bought my B60, it started to have a slight, sporadic issue that clearly was not something that should have been happening.  I placed a call to the company, they put me on the phone with a tech and within 5 minutes she had placed an order to have a new unit shipped to me.  You just don't see customer service like that very often these days.  The new unit works perfectly.  Thank you Keurig.

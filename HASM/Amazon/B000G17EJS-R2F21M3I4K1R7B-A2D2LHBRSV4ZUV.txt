Title: Inadequate for its stated purpose
Content:
Electric space heaters are a poor choice to begin with, in terms of energy efficiency and economy. The product description of the DeLonghi DUH1100T liberally employs words such as "heavy duty" and states this unit's application is primary heating in a garage or basement.  The all-metal construction and safety shut-off are additional attractive features.  Unfortunately, this heater is simply not up to the task.  The temperature achieved by the coils and the very small volume of air moved by the fan are wholly inadequate to heating anything more than the smallest enclosed space.  At the highest settings, air movement is not perceptible much more than ten inches from the face.  There is no possibility of it raising the temperature in the average room, and there is no point to even considering its use in a garage.  The roll bars on the front are decorative, but the rear feet are so much lower than those in front that it is overbalanced to the rear and tips easily in that direction.  I've seen smaller DeLonghi heaters which are useful in a small office, for example in a medical clinic.  This unit, however, is very disappointing, of no practical use and I will be returning it.

Title: excellent product
Content:
Bought this heater for my Mom who is elderly and lives alone.  She loves it.  I love the safety factor of not having any exposed heating elements.  This is her second one.  Provides enough heat for her medium sized bedroom--she uses this exclusively for that room and believes she saves on electricity by not turning on the baseboard heat for that room.  She lives in a house built in the 1800's, so it has very high ceilings.  She uses the second one in her bath and dressing area.

Title: nice for the price, power, silence and the size
Content:
Display is glossy. hand resting spots below keyboard are shiny and get greasy fast with your palms on them. mouse pad is sick, but sensitive cuz its close to the space bar. good looking brushed metal top, wish it were on the inside too, so it wouldnt get so greasy and catch dust. makes no noise at all, running processor intensive software and parallel computing..might breathe hard sometimes and feel warm air out the side, but i guess this ulv processor is the way to go...battery only lasts 5.5 hours in windows with all my stuff installed and only browsing the internet, maybe in asus mode it lasts longer if you're just surfing or chating or listening to music on some headphones. display does flash when i plug in the hdmi sometimes, others its fine...and the audio works sometimes, others not. i found you just have to cycle thru the display options with the fn button and itll work. very light weight, again, wish it were all brushed metal cuz sometimes i feel like i'm squeezing it when i hold it like a book to my side, and ive noticed there is a spot where it does rub that has begun to fade. and its so small i wouldnt mind it being a bit more robust with a little more weight.

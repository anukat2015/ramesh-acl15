Title: Well impressed.
Content:
Over 3 days i tried 3 cameras. I wanted a DSLR but was unsure of what to buy. I tried the Nikon D40 first. Although a good camera i didn't think much of the quality of some of the pictures. Second, I was then recommended the Canon XTi. I took 150 shots and took it back to the store. The same, there was just something missing from the shots, it was decent but again something missing. Thirdly, I was recommended the Nikon D80 by my brother who owns one, I have seen his pictures of some of his landscape and nature shots and they where awesome, so on a whim i paid the extra and got the D80. I have to say, i am well impressed, i should of got it from the beginning. This camera was night and day over the D40 and the Canon XTi.
You will not be disappointed by this camera. If your going to pay $600 for an XTi or a lower end Nikon, pay the extra and buy this instead.

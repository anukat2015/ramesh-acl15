Title: Best vacuum I've ever owned
Content:
This is really the best vacuum I've owned.  It picks up everything - and usually on the first stroke through the carpet.  I've had a hard time getting hair off a low pile rug, but this vacuum picked it all right up.  It is light, easy to store, and is able to get under furniture easily.
I read some reviews prior to my purchase about people having to empty the bag after just one run through their house, but I have not had the same experience.  Perhaps they had pets.  
Another common complaint I noticed in some reviews was that it was hard to push.  I must agree with that.  It seems they put some resistance on the wheels for some reason.  I need the workout anyway.  I wish the cord was a tad bit longer, but that doesn't bother me too much either.

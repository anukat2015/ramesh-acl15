Title: Powerful DSLR
Content:
My A700p replaced a well functioning Nikon 8700. The improvement in speed is striking. Low light pictures are fantastic due to the steady shot function.The only disadvantage of any DSLR is increased size and weight. However, well compensated for by the increased performance. Also nice to be able to use my old Maxxum lenses.

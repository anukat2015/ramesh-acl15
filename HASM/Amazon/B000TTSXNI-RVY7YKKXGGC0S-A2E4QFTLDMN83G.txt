Title: I love my heater!
Content:
I love the Lasko tower heater. It's awesome. It works great and keeps my entire office very warm, and the remote control just makes it that much better because I dont have to move away from my desk to make any of the selections that are on the actual heater. The shipping was free and it requires no assembly, just unpack and plug in! It doesnt get much easier than that. Oh and another plus, my little remote came with batteries.

Title: Perfection!
Content:
I have a family of 6.  Three boys ages 17, 12, 10 and a girl who is 3.  We all cannot get enough cocoa latte!  We put our favorite mix (Ovaltine!) in with milk and it mixes it, heats it perfectly and froths it.  Top it with whip cream for a extra touch. Can't get enough.  We are glad Santa brought it!

Title: Digital Camera on Steroids...
Content:
This camera blows my mind.  It has features and functions I never would have dreamed a camera to have...Now I have to say, I'm "old" (56) so I'm used to more dinosaur like cameras.  But the Canon Rebel XTi is the absolute coolest thing I've ever used in photography.  And, I'm just now learning it.  It is like buying a Ferrari and only going 60!  There is so much more this machine can do.  IT is a dream camera, for me.  I can hardly wait to figure it all out!!!  lol

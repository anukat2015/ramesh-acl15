Title: My second ipod...
Content:
About two years ago my father gave me a ipod classic for Christmas.  Sadly, about three months later it was stolen.  I have been checking out various styles of ipods and their reviews since.  I bought the 5th edition Nano (16 GB) because it was a great price here on Amazon, it did all that my original ipod did plus some, and I went with the 16 GB because it was barely more expensive than the 8 GB but doubled the space!  So far I am super impressed with this.  IPod has added a lot of cool features since my first experience.  I love the radio feature and the shake to shuffle feature!  My daughter has an older edition of the iPod shuffle which I did consider because of its affordability, however the new version didn't have the controls to skip songs which stinks.  I am very pleased I went with the current nano.  I can't wait to discover more of what it will do and plan on buying my active mother one for Christmas this year : ) Also....you can listen to it without headphones.  That is sooo cool!

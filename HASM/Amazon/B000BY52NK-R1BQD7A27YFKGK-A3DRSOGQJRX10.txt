Title: I'm an amateur and still learning, but what a camera!
Content:
I have to first admit that I'm a pure amateur (at best) photographer. My wife was advised by a friend at work that the Nikon D200 was a MUST if I was going to get a better digital camera. He was 100% correct.
It's a bit overwhelming at first for someone at my level of photography experience, but with practice and patience the camera has performed beyond description. I will, however, admit to buying a DVD on how to best use the camera (a great help, by the way!) and after only a week I am very confident in using the camera and recommend the camera (and get the DVD on how to use the camera!) to everyone who wants to pay the somewhat steep price for the top of the line digital SLR camera out there right now.

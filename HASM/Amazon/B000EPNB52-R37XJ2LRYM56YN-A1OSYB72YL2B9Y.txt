Title: Ipod Question.
Content:
I have not own a ipod nano yet so everyone can pretty much ignore my 3 stars.
here is my first question: Does Ipod Nano work with Window media player? I have over 2000 song on my computer and if so
my second question is if it work you i be able to see the ablum art and everything else display on the nano as if i was getting music from itune.
If both answer are yes, than i will definitly buy an ipod nano.
Thank all for helping me.

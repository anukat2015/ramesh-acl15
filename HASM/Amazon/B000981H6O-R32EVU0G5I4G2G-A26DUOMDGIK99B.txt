Title: LOUD!
Content:
We bought this "hand vacuum cleaner" about 2 months ago (Feb. 09) and immediately found it was (for us) incredibly loud. I thought I would get used to it . . . but I haven't. Perhaps it's just me (I wear a hearing aid) but I find using it to actually hurt my ears. I take my hearing aid out (reasonable enough, right?) but I also have to put something in my ears to make it even usable for me.
If you have any type of hearing issue, or are just sensitive to (very) loud noises, I would consider another product.
PS - Yes, I should have returned it immediately and yes, I do feel a bit silly having to take all the precautions I do, just to use this "quick" vacuum!

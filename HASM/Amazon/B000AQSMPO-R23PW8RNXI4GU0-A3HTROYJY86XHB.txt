Title: Pretty good coffee maker
Content:
This coffee maker was given to me as a gift a few weeks before Christmas 08. I am a major coffee drinker and the first thing i noticed about this maker was that the coffee was not very strong. I don't even like my coffee that strong but this coffee was really weak even for me. However, I do enjoy having it with the flavored coffee and have noticed that i will use less if any creamer which saves money and calories. After having this coffee maker for about a month it brewed one day all by itself and then started blinking not ready and never worked again. Thankfully the people at Keurig were very nice and told me that my coffee maker had overheated and are sending me out a new one. 
So just a few things to keep in mind.
1. makes weak coffee
2. this particular model atleast overheats. 
I am still glad to have this maker though and will continue to use the new one being sent out to me. It makes coffee fast and looks nice on my counter.

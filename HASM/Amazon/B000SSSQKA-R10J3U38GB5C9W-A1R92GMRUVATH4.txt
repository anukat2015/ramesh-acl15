Title: Light weight vacuum cleaner
Content:
I have both saltillo tile and carpeted floors and find this vacuum to be very satisfactory, especially for the tile surfaces.  It does a pretty good job of removing surface dirt and dust from my low-pile carpet.  Because I have arthritic problems, I find this cleaner to be far easier to use than my very heavy upright Hoover.
  I also find the wand to be a little shorter than I would like and the two attachments (dust brush and crevice tool) to be poor quality.
  For my needs, however, I am very pleased that I made this purchase.

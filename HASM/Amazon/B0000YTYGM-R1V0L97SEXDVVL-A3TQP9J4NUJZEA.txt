Title: best brewed coffee ever
Content:
This coffee pot makes the best brewed coffee we've ever tasted. I bought the gold filter for it, which does make a positive difference in flavor, although it's also good through a paper filter. It's very convenient, too.  Truthfully, I bought it mostly for when we have several guests and trying to keep up making french press coffee was taking a lot of time away from other hostessing details. My husband and I love the richness of french press. Coffee from this pot (with the gold filter) is the best combination of the smoothness you get from a drip pot and the richness you get from french press. We've actually switched to using this pot for our early morning coffee for the convenience of the automatic programming.
A comment on the overflow problem: If you use espresso grind, it's going to make a mess. It's also going to taste terrible!
Yes, it pours slowly. Be patient, it's worth the wait.
It does keep the coffee hot and tasting delicious for several hours. 
This coffee pot is well worth it!

Title: Not as great as it seems
Content:
I got the 8 GB Zune for my son for Christmas, along with the dock and a case, which was quite an investment. He loved it. But after a few weeks, he plugged it into the dock and the bottom fell apart. It was replaced without a problem. As for the second Zune, after the "return policy window" expired, to THIS DAY does NOT WORK properly. It will not stay connected to the computer and we keep getting a message about malfunction. We tried and tried to get it up and going. FRUSTRATING. I refuse to spend my valuable time with tech support. Finally I called and cancelled our subscription, which is expensive too! It looks like a nice little system, but we cringe when we see the word ZUNE. NO LUCK FOR US WITH THE ZUNE. He bought a PSP instead.

Title: I'm comfortable again
Content:
Unfortunately the  homes in So. California were not built with the idea that we do have weeks of 40 degree winter nights.  As a result, everyone complains about the substandard heating systems.  I've spent the last eight years trying to get the downstairs of my home to 70 degrees since the heat rises to the second floor and the downstairs stays around 66 degrees...too cold for me.  I've tried using a quartz heater but that is only effective if you're sitting still in front of it and does nothing to warm the air.  I finally discovered the Delonghi oil-filled radiator and my home is finally comfortable.  My downstairs which is approximately 600 sq ft stays a consistent 70 degrees and the furnace upstairs runs only about half as much.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Two neighbors visited and immediately ordered one for themselves.  Unfortunately one arrived with the wheels broken so he's awaiting a replacement.  But after trying it out, he was very impressed at the comfortable heat it produces.  Also, I was pleasantly surprised by its appearance.  It has a cover so it does not look like a radiator and sort of blends into the background.  I give two thumbs up for this product.

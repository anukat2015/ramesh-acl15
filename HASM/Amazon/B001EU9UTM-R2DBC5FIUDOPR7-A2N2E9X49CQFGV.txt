Title: Good machine, great espresso
Content:
I really like my Mr. Coffee ECMP50. It exerts the required pressure to form the crema, a rich foam. 
The steamer does a great job of foaming the milk for a really good cappuccino. I wish that the process was a little faster, but I do enjoy brewing this treat. Add a little bit of chocolate syrup to the milk before foaming, and you get a really good mocha cappucino.
A really good bargain, it compares favorably to machines costing three times the price. Enjoy!

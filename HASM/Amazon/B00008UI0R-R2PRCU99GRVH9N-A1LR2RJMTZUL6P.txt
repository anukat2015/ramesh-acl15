Title: Windtunnel Bagless Vacuum
Content:
I really like the mobility and compactness of this vacuum. It does have great suction and I like the carpet to floor ability. I have to say that I don't like that the two attachments (one for floors and one for upholstery) don't have anywhere on the vacuum to be stored. You have to carry them with you or run back to the closet to find them. I have been quite pleased with the performance of this vacuum thusfar.

Title: Best (cheap) vacuum I've ever had
Content:
You could pay a lot more for a Miele vacuum and get something quieter and better built. But I've been using this for months now and have been totally happy with its quality and its price. Yes, the hose is a bit flimsy and will occasionally fold; yes, it's loud; yes, it heats up when used. But it also has extremely powerful suction and does a great job on hard floors and carpet. The suction control ring on the handle takes a moment to practice but works great once you're used to it -- sometimes the simplest solution is fine, as in this case. I've never had problems with the attachments falling off as I've seen described (just push them on hard and they stay on). Because it uses bags, there's no post-vacuuming cleanup as with bagless vacs I've used. It's also much easier to maneuver than an upright. I'd definitely buy this again.

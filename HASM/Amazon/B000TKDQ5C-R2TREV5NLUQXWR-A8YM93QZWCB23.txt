Title: This little heater puts out a lot more heat than you expect
Content:
When I first opened the box, it was much smaller than I was expecting. But after using it for a couple of days, I was amazed how much heat this little unit can put out. I run it all night next to my bed on cold nights with no other heat sources in the apartment and it works very well. Cord length seems just about right as well. One thing to bear in mind is that it is very small so if you plan to use it as a floor heater, it might help to prop it up on a stand.

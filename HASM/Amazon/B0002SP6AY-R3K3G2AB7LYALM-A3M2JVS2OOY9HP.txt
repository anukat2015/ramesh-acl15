Title: The thermostat will not work with a 2 stage heat pump with emergency heat.
Content:
Careful - The thermostat will not work with a 2 stage heat pump with emergency heat, which I have. There was nothing in the product description which stated that. (Ignore my star rating since I never got it hooked up.  However, I had to put something in.)

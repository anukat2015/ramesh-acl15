Title: supervise this little heater
Content:
I did a previous positive review of the two heaters I purchased, but want to add additional information. Both these little heaters slowly move forward both on the floor and on a counter in my motorhome. The surfaces are completely level. I tried them in my house, same "walking". So, check for that problem and don't leave them unsupervised.

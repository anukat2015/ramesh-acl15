Title: Great Heater
Content:
I bought this for my bedroom which is roughly 20' x 12'.  Previously I had a ceramic style heater which I could not run at night due to the fan noise.  I asked a friend of mine who owned a similar heater and he suggested that I ensure whatever heater I purchased had a timer, which this one does.
I was worried that this heater might not have enough output to heat my bedroom, but I am pleased to say that this heater can heat up pretty much my whole upstairs (Note I am in NC, so it doesn't get that cold).
I can't think of any downsides and I am very happy with the purchase.

Title: Convenience has its drawbacks
Content:
Bought this machine for my mother a few months ago. This is the perfect idea for those who can't use up a bag of coffee before it starts to turn bad (about 2 weeks for preground). 
Pros- Super convenient, easy use, quick brew time, no "coffee sludge" to clean up after brewing, option to set it to brew at a given time, k-cups come in wide variety of flavored, unflavored, and decaf coffee as well as various types of tea and hot cocoa, optional reusable k-cup basket available. 
Cons- Those used to freshly ground whole-bean coffee and or coffee brewed in a french press will find coffee brewed in this machine to be extremely weak or watered down tasting. Frustrating for the environmentally conscious people out there (each cup of coffee requires the use and disposal of a little plastic cup. cups have no markings that they are recycleable, so they probably aren't), a reusable basket sort of defeats the convenience factor of the machine.
Final Comments: I would recommend this machine to people who aren't too picky about the taste of their coffee, people who must have the convenience of almost instant coffee brewing, and to people who don't have a guilty conscience about not being able to recycle the k-cups. It is a great thing for my mother, but I would never be satisfied with it.

Title: Great Little Heater
Content:
This Honeywell ceramic heater is by far the fastest heating ceramic I own. Heat output is very good and the fan is powerful enough to distribute the heat out into the room, unlike most ceramic heaters.
The only negative is the fan is a little noisy.
Great heater and highly recommended for heating bedrooms, bathrooms and other small rooms.

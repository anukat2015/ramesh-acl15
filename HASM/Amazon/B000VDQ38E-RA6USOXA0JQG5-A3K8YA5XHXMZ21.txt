Title: Amazing vacumn!
Content:
I bought this vacuum a few months ago and while my pit bull does not shed as much as some dogs, the vacuum picks up an amazing amount of dirt from my carpet. I vacuumed a small section of carpet and the amount of dust and dander pulled out of the carpet surprised me. I read a large amount of reviews before purchasing this vacuum and every review applauding this vacuum were 100% accurate. The little attachments make cleaning crevices and stairs an easy task, I no longer hate vacuuming. My only caution for using this vacuum is it does not pick up pieces of carpet my dog clawed away from the base of the carpet. I attempted to suck up pieces and it clogged the gear drive in the front of the vacuum, but I was able to pull the pieces out without causing real damage to the vacuum.

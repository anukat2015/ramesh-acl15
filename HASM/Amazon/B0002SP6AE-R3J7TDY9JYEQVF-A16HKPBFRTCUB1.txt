Title: Best Buy
Content:
I installed this unit in my house.  It was easy to install.  Programming was a chore but well worth it.  As far as I can tell it has saved me it's cost within the first year of use.  This unit is much better than the Honeywell version I installed for a friend.  I recommend this unit as the best bang for the buck.

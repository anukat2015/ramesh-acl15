Title: Brilliant
Content:
This is the best present that I've bought to myself for a while!  What a top camera for such an amature photographer like myself.
Just point and shoot.  If the results are rubbish, then delete it and try again with the other settings.
Now, I'm forever taking pictures without the issue with develpoing 35mm film, whilst trying to remember which settings to select whilst taking the 24 / 36 pictures.
Well worth the money!

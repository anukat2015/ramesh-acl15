Title: Great MP3 Player!
Content:
It may not be an Ipod 60 Gig., but it is definetly a great MP3 player.  It is the first one I have ever owned, and I am extremly happy with it.  With no song(s) on it, it can hold almost 18 hours of voice (with NO SD Card!!).  It is definetly the best bargain you can get for the price.  Unless you've got more than $55 bucks, this is a great choice.  Oh, uh, and don't forget to get the firmware update on the website.

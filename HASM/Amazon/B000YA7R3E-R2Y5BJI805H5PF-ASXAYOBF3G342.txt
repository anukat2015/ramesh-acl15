Title: Awesome!!
Content:
Yes right, it's not a most powerful laptop(obviously it's older model)out there but this machine is very reliable and great for somebody who try out Apple brand for first time. This great looking (white) laptop never crashes or freeze. And remember when it comes to Apple laptop, they don't get virus somehow. Just for these reason it's worth to own a apple ibook to me. Great machine!!

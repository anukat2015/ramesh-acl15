Title: GREAT laptop for the $
Content:
I bought this laptop when it was on sale at office max recently for $480.00 plus tax. IT IS FANTASTIC!! the i3 processor is lightning fast, the LCD screen is excellent for streaming videos. beautiful picture. this laptop is built solid (it is heavy) which is ok for me since I never take it out of the house anyway. the shiny finish on the shell does show fingerprints, but really thats all I can say negative about this great machine!! I am not a gamer, I am a basic applications user (videos, emails etc etc) so this laptop more that fits the bill for my needs.the keyboard works great, the touchpad works like a charm. LOVE IT..!!! also...FYI..the store offered me the extended warranty.. 2 years for $200.00 extra!!! forget that...I bought an extended warranty right here at amazon (squaretrade warranties).. 3 years..includes accidents/spills/dropping..for $82.00!! another great deal from amazon..:)

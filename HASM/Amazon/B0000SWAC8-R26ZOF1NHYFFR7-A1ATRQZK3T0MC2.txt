Title: pulls to left, breaks easily
Content:
Bought this a year ago.  Tends to pull to the left, which is especially annoying when vacuuming with your left hand.  I kept the unit because it has great suction.  However, after a year of light use (I only own a few area rugs), a plastic tab broke from the connection to the motor head.  This rendered the entire motor head unusable since the tube pulls right out when I vacuum.  Since I never disconnect the motor head, the fact that the tab broke indicates that it was made really poorly.  I brought it to two repair places (the first one doesn't do warranty work).  They both said that these units are always breaking, though the motor is strong.

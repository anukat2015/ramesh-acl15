Title: Love This!
Content:
We were looking for a replacement coffee maker -- one without a glass carafe -- and came across this on sale on Black Friday. On a lark, we decided to pick it up ... for fifty bucks, what did we have to lose? Our current machine, a Porsche designed Bosch, cost 5 times as much and lasted 3 years. If this lasted one year, we figured we a head of the game. Given the price we paid, it's a terrific value. I love the clean lines, and non-cluttered look. The timer features (on & off) are useful. 
There are two downsides, which are not uncommon to coffee makers in general. First, to fill up the reservoir & coffee basket, the machine has to be pulled out from under the kitchen cabinets, just like any flip top coffee maker. I prefer a machine in which you can fill from the side or from a swing arm. Second, the machine requires electricity to keep coffee warm. I prefer a non-energy solution, like a good warming carafe. Actually, these were a couple of the features on our wish list for a coffee maker. If the machine had those features, it would be 5* all the way.

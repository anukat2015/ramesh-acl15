Title: Camera good but problem with lens
Content:
The camera body is great and I enjoy it.  But the EF28-135 IS USM zoom died after only six weeks.  The diaphragm somehow became dislodged while I was manually focusing the lens, and now it rattles around inside and the lens is unusable.  I'll need to return it under warranty, but fortunately already had other lenses that fit the camera so I haven't been in a hurry.

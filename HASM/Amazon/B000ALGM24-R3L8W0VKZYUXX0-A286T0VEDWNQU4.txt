Title: Great thermostat at a great price!
Content:
I got this thermostat to replace the basic mercury one for myself and my parents.  Both of us are very happy with the results!
It's pretty easy to set up.  But don't overestimate the effort...expect 30-60 minutes for installation and programming if you're technically inclined.  You will need the manual!
Accurate and has all the features that you'd expect in a mid-end thermostat.  I love the home today and energy usage features...haven't seen this on other thermostats.
My only 2 gripes are that it only shows you the current temperature.  You need to push a button to see what temperature it's set to.  And if you want to change the current temperature you have to told the button for a few seconds, which wasn't intuitive to me.
Best unit under $50!

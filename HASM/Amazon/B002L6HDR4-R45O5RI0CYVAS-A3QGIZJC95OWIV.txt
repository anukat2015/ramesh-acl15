Title: What can I say?
Content:
It's easy to use, it's light, it looks cool and I can take a ton of music with me. Even the video works great. Compared to other portable music players it is overpriced, but hey ... that's Apple. I've never been satisfied with any headphones that comes with music players but that is just an anatomical issue I guess. Bought headphones from another company for running instead.

Title: By Far the Best!
Content:
I have had this vacuum up and running for only an hour and I must say that this is the BEST VACUUM I HAVE EVER OWNED! I have a pet and was using one of the original Fantom Fury vacuums and I thought it did a great job; wrong it didn't pick up anyting like this one does. I had to clean the cup out at least five times and I only used it in three areas of my home. I did all of the research before I decided on this model and I am not disappointed and you won't be either. I was really impressed with the suction power when I used the hose and tools.
The only thing I didn't care for was that the exhaust port is in the back of the machine and blows on you, but you can't have everything. Try it you'll like it!

Title: Lots of heat for a little cash
Content:
My wife and I bought 2 of these to give our utility budget a break this winter. 
This heater puts out alot of heat. The On/Off/Heat Settings switch, along with the Thermostat switch, feel very solid for a ceramic heater this inexpensive. It has a handle so it's easily transportable. Power light goes off when the unit is turned off (unlike others in this price range). Can be turned off (Some other similarly priced heaters need to have you pull the plug for the heater to go off).  If it gets too hot, it will shut itself off (Safety feature). It's not whisper quiet but it is certainly not overly loud, as some others have complained. It also has an anti-freeze setting, if that is why you need it.
For the money, I can't see how you can get a better deal on a ceramic heater. I checked out all the similarly priced ceramic heaters here on Amazon, and quite frankly the combination of features, efficient ceramic heating element, solid design and inexpensive price make this a "no-brainer" as far as inexpensive ceramic heaters go. Get 2 and give the gift of ceramic heating efficiency this Christmas. OOPS, politically incorrect. TOO BAD!!!

Title: Great product to use a mp3 player in swimming pool or any place with water
Content:
This is a great product, previously I was looking for any MP3 player water resistant, but I only find crappy products
Then I found this case for my iPod nano, this is really grate because the case support al the functions for the iPod, you can control sound with a integrated wheel in the case, it also have buttons for the backward and forward, Menu and play, so the iPod stay 100% functionally under water
Also the sound plugs is water proof, this is a great product.
Now you not will be left alone with you borings thoughts in swimming practices

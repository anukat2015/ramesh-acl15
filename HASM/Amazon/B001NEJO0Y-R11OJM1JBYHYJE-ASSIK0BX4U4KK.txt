Title: I love this laptop!
Content:
This is the perfect computer for all my needs!  
I play all my games without it stressing.  
I prefer to use it at work as opposed to using the 'office supplied' desktop ... I eaSsily take work home ... and can get online in an instant anywhere there's a signal!
I play my music and even get better audio than my better half does with his computer. (The harmon/kardon speaker ROCK!)  
I gotta be honest ... We found it here... and I shopped around to try and beat the price.  Needless to say ... we bought it here. 
I read every review, good and bad (smudges??) , here and on other sites and would not hesitate to recommend it to everyone. And if smudges are your biggest issue... then your life is 'perty dang good'!!

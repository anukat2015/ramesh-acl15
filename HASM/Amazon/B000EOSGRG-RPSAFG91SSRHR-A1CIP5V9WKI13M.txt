Title: Just a poor quality product
Content:
I've owned this for about a year. Took good care of it, followed instructions, and didn't use it very frequently - no more than once every two weeks tops. Now the battery no longer holds any kind of charge - when it's turned on it emits a wimpery, sad little sound and has absolutely no suction. I did not purchase a cheapo model, I spent $40 on this and I expected it to last a lot longer and perform a lot better. I'd steer clear of this model.

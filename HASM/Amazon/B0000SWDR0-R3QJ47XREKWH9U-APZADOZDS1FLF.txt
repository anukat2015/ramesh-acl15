Title: Huge disappointment
Content:
I could create more suction with a straw! Very disappointing unit backed by possibly the most unhelpful support personnel imaginable. Used for quite some time but still no light comes on for bag full. Find out that even though machine is brand new light does not work. They want me to pay to send it to them for service!
I ordered bags and attachment from Electrolux and four weeks later still nothing.
Over-priced, under-powered and unhelpful should be the motto of this unit.

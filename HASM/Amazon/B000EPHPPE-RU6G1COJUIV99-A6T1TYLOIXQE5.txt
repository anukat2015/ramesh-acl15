Title: It happened...I am offically a "pod person"
Content:
After many years of my mother trying to convince me that I wanted a iPod, she gave me one for Christmas. I was excited because I like to listen to radio programs and I knew that some of my favorites were now "podcasts," though I still wasn't sold on transferring all of my CD collection onto a little media player. After the first few days of using my iPod, I was HOOKED. I now have over 1,000 songs on my iPod (and I'm still not done transferring my CDs), 70+ podcasts, and some of my favorite television shows. I am selling most of my CDs since there are over a hundred that I only like one or two songs on. The convenience of these things is amazing. And how about that video screen? The picture is amazingly clear - I've watched quite a few television programs on it already. I'm sold.

Title: Love it!
Content:
I upgraded from the Rebel Xt. I am using it with the Tamron 18-270mm vibration control lens.
Also got the battery grip made by Opteka, and Canon Speedlight 580 II flash.
The combination is amazing. So easy to use and it's extremely responsive!
Impressive indoor and outdoor performance.
I mostly shoot in Av mode with largest available aperture. I use a "User Defined" Picture Style
that has the Sharpness at the second highest setting, and contrast and saturation set 2 levels below max.
Really like the My Menu feature where you can have  six or so things you most commonly access.
Physical buttons are also there for the most common settings including ISO.
HD Video is amazing and super smooth at 720p, almost professional looking. At 1080p, it feels a little jerky
because it is only 20Hz (not 24Hz or 30Hz). I wonder if a future firmware will take it to 24Hz.
The resolution at 1080p is obviously amazing. I am happy with 720p.
I think I am set for the next 5 years with the above equipment and this camera. Highly recommend,
although I suspect if someone already has the 450D it may not be worth it to upgrade.

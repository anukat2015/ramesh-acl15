Title: OH MY GOD I HATE THIS HEATER!
Content:
I'm right there with the person who's title was: WORTHLESS.  I bought this heater from a store that has a sign that says "Ace Hardware" but after arguing with the owner about getting my money back for this worthless heater I find out that the sign is bogus and he is an independent owner!  I have been stuck with this heater for two weeks and I absolutely despise it!  All it does is tempt you with some warm air just to turn off when you're just finally getting comfortable. Then, when you resign yourself to just being freezing cold (even though you were insightful enough to go out and buy a heater) the darned thing turns on again.  Not only that, but it has this annoying way of slightly starting up, then shutting down immediately just before it gives you another blast of warm... but never for very long.
I called Ace to see if they would let me return it since they let that guy operate using their sign.  They said "no dice", said they would look into his operation and call me back. They never called.  What a great experience all around.  Thanks Honeywell. Thanks Ace Hardware. Never again for either of you.

Title: Efficient..but nothing special
Content:
I recently bought the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser. After reading the reviews some good and some bad-thought I would go ahead and form my own opinion. I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. We have two dogs, a cat, and two young boys. Needless to say I vacuum often. It does a decent job with picking up the dog hair. I do however have to go over the carpet several times for it to pick up crumbs, lint, ect. We have mostly wood floors with area rugs. It does a wonderful job on shorter carpet, but with longer carpets not so well. As far as being too heavy I find it to be just right. No heavier than what a normal vacuum should be. All in all it gets the job done.

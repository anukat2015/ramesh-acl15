Title: COFFEE ON THE GO
Content:
This coffeemaker was purchased specifically for the use in our motorthome on weekend adventures. I am impressed at how quickly we can have a pot of coffee readily available for us (about 7 minutes). We decided to go with the color "RED", not because it was fashionable, but because one our young grandchildren thought it would look good in our kitchen area. She was right. We now have color coordinated cutlery (from Amazon.Com), as well as kithen towels, table placemats, and oven mits/pot holders. My wife suggested matching dinnerware but that's where I drew the line. We're campng out, NOT living in the motorhome. Bottom line -- I would recommend this coffeemaker to anyone needing a quiet, reliable, consistent kitchen appliance designed for this purpose, whether at home on on the road. By the way, a morning cup of fresh coffee seems to taste better with a view of a lake, stream, or ocean. Think about that! GJM

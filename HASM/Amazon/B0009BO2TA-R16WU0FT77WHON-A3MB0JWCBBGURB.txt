Title: Good Looks - don't count
Content:
Purchased this Hoover 3 months ago. I currently have a Eureka Mighty Mite and decided that I wanted to have another lightweight canister vacuum for downstairs. I happened to come across the Hoover Bright Orange canister vacuum and thought it was so neat looking, and since it was a Hoover - how could you go wrong.
Well the problems are as follows: suction - fair at best; wand connecting to the head won't stay put - it keeps coming apart no matter how hard you push the wand into the head; the bag - since I wasn't getting any suction I checked the bag and found that though it was only half-filled, the bottom of the bag had disintegrated - this happened twice. I'm not sure if this was due to its close proximity to the filter/motor, but I have never had a bag do this on any other vacuum cleaner I've owned. 
Sorry to say, but it's a great looking vacuum, but that's the only thing going for it.
Definitely buy the Eureka Mighty Mite if you're looking for a vacuum for light cleanups.

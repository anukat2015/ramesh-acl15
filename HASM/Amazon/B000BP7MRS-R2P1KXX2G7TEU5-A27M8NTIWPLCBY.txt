Title: Braun KF590 SL
Content:
Excellent coffee maker.   A few drawbacks....I have used a Braun coffee maker for approx. 20 years and love them, the only problem with this one is  that you tend to spill if you pour to fast.  It drips, like most do but I don't recall my old Braun's having this problem.  The coffee is very hot and has great flavor as usual.  Looks great and buttons are much improved and it is very easy to program.  Other than getting used to pouring slower, I love this machine and will stick with Braun.

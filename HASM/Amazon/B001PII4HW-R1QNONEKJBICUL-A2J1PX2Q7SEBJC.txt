Title: Bittersweet machine
Content:
I actually got my Sony Vaio N-series from Best Buy. However, I felt complied to write about my experience with my machine. 
Wanting a inexpensive laptop for college, I got a Sony Vaio N-Series. At first I thought, "this thing rocks!" A large screen, nice roomy keyboard. By the end of the semester my thoughts changed dramatically. 
First thing that charged my opinion on Sony: I accidentally dropped a small aerosol can of hair mousse on my lappy. The force was so great that the hard drive "popped out" of place. The campus technology director said that cannot be the case...usually laptop hard drives are protected to vast degrees. A small, light weight can should not have dislodged the hard drive. Long story short the hard drive had to be replaced via the dislodged--all from a 7oz can of hair mousse. Apparently Sony can really protect them hard drives! 
Second thing: The battery life. On one charge the battery lasts about 45 minutes. That's with the screen dimmed. 
Lastly: The plug-in wall charger. It's been three years since I took my laptop out of the box. For about two years the charger worked great...fully energized the laptop etc. Until this year. One day, while doing my daily web page viewing, the charger "blew-up" and refused. I had to purchase an after-market replacement. Just my luck, so I thought. However, a few days ago my mom's (more expensive) Sony Vaio charger blew-up as well. So it is not just me. 
Do not get me wrong. Sony has created some awesome products and other laptops. However, my Sony laptop experience is nothing spectacular.

Title: Problems with laptop and customer service
Content:
I just bought this computer and have had more problems with it than anything that I've ever owned. It has been in the hands of Toshiba repair center getting "fixed" for about half of the time that I've owned it! Would definetly recommend a different brand... Although customer service was friendly, they wouldn't help me at all. The computer still had MAJOR problems and Toshiba refused to replace the defective product. Toshiba just lost all my business! I will say that Amazon completely took care of me and this review is against the Toshiba product, not the service at Amazon. Thank you for helping me Amazon where Toshiba would not!

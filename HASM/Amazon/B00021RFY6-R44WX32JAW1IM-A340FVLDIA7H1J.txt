Title: Good, when it works!
Content:
I am on my second Cuisinart Grind & Brew coffeemaker.  I love the convenience of throwing in my beans and water the night before and waking up to freshly brewed coffee.  That's about where the positive comments end.
The negative?
1)  Too many parts to clean.  OK, I guess that's the price you pay for getting fresh coffee, so not too much of a negative.
2)  Here is the major negative comment on this device.  Like I previously stated, I'm on my second machine now.  For the second time, the motor has died.  After the motor on my first machine froze up, I figured it might have been a fluke.  Of course, the machine was out of warranty.  But, since I liked the fresh brewed coffee, I thought I would give it a second shot.  So, bought another one.  Shortly after a year, the motor gave out on the second machine.
People say that the third time is the charm, but I think that it's time for me to give up on this machine and grind my own beans.  Yeah, not as convenient, but I can't see buying one of these machines once a year.

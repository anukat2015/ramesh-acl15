Title: We LOVE our Keurig Platinum
Content:
The Keurig Platinum is hands down the best birthday present I ever gave my wife (of 23 years). After 6 months of daily use we still love it. It hasn't replaced our 12 cup coffee maker which runs each morning, but my wife and I both enjoy a a coffee fix after dinner. We used to spend $50+ a week in the evening at Starbucks or Biggby's. Now we spend about $7-$8 a week (at $0.60 a cup X 12-14 cups a week). 
We love the huge variety of K-Cups. There IS a learning curve figuring out which brands and flavors you like. 
From a cold start the unit is ready to deliver a cup in 2-1/4 to 3 minutes. From a warm start you'll have a cup in about 35-40 seconds. I've set the auto timer to have it on from 4:00 PM - 10:00 PM. 
And this unit is quiet. My niece has the B60 and it's much louder while pumping. For about 20 seconds her's vibrates loudly. Not the Platinum at all.
In the box: Unit w/ 60 oz reservoir, variety box of K-cups; mostly coffee and a few tea and hot chocolate, Instructions & K-cup catalog.
One more time: I love this product and I highly recommend the platinum. Especially since it's been reduced. I paid $200 and it's paid for itself in 5 months. (Sorry Starbucks).

Title: Great sound and easy to use
Content:
I love everything about this iPod Nano.  I love how thin it is but it still has a screen with clear, sharp video display.  The sound is outstanding.  I did purchase a set of marshmallow earbuds that stay in my ears better.  This also improved my ability to hear the great quality sound.  I found the earbuds that came with it to be hard, large and less than comfortable, and I have never thought of myself as having small ears or ear openings.

Title: Much better than older version...
Content:
Had old version of this machine for years, and had love-hate relasionship with it...we loved the coffee it made, but hated the bad pour, too much clean-up and noise.New version has been in use in our house for about 10 days, and the improvements are great!  Easier to clean, less noise and pours without missing a drop!  Has fewer things to clean and a better gold foil filter too.

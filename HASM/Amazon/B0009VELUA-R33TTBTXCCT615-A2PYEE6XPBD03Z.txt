Title: Yea! No decanter!
Content:
This has been an outstanding coffee maker. We purchased this to use in our small office. We make four to five pots of coffee per day. We have been using this machine for three months and best thing about this unit is, no decanter. The coffee never gets that burnt bitter taste after being on for a few hours. The pullout tray on the bottom is covenant for the employees that use tall travel mugs. I use a Cuisinart coffee maker at home and have been pleased with its performance and that is what prompted me to purchase this unit. After using this machine at the office, I look forward in the near future replacing my home unit with a decanter-less DCC-2000 or equal.

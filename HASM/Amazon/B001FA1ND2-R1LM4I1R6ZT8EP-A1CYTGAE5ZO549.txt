Title: Every thing I thought it would be!
Content:
I bought this Ipod Nano for my 73 yr old husband, who is a classic rock fan, loves such muscians as Eric Clapton, Bob Seger, Pink Floyd, etc. He would get so tired having to listen to music he didn't like just to get to hear the ones he does like. So he asked me to get him the Ipod so he could have just "his" music.
Found this product to be very easy to operate, and Itunes very easy to navigate and put the songs onto the Ipod.
Now we are "both" using the Ipod, whenever I can get it away from him!
So far we've got 40 songs downloaded onto the Ipod, looking forward to adding a lot more. Some we have transferred off CD's we had, but most we purchased from Itunes.
Our grandkids are so thrilled that their old grandparents are so hip, but we know a good thing when we see it!
Our only problem is with the earbuds, they won't stay in our ears, so we are going to get a better set. I still gave it 5 stars because everything else is great!

Title: Not the same quality as the older Krups Models
Content:
I had a Krups purchased in 1999 that lasted 7 years - it was the best coffee maker I have ever owned. After it died, I noticed that Krups was not making the same model so I bought a Braun KF510 (which I love and highly recommend).  
I bought this Krups as a Christmas gift for my parents, and I was disappointed in the quality.  The pot itself feels extremely thin (much thinner than my $35 Braun machine).  It did not come with a gold mesh filter (or any filter)and the filter basket does not really fit properly with the machine, so it snags every time you close it.  
Another problem is that you cannot turn the pot back on once it turns off: the machine tries to brew all over again, and then turns off after indicating there is no water.  So, you must program the coffee pot to stay on longer, and if you want to keep it warm after it turns off, you cannot.  I have never seen a coffee pot do this.
Overall, my Braun KF510 machine is sturdier and more well-made than this one.  The Krups does make a good-tasting cup of coffee, and my parents seem happy with it.  I think a better machine could be purchased for less money.  I do not think it is worth the price.
Note:  In all of my research while looking for decent coffee makers, Braun and Krups are the best on the market.

Title: Not Bad for the Money!
Content:
Bought three of these. No, they're not library silent, but you're not going to get one in this size range and cost that is. If you buy this 5200 BTU air conditioner thinking you won't hear it, think again! I find it reasonable for such a small unit, and is a lot quieter than the portable it replaced. It cools an average 150 to 200 square foot bedroom relatively quickly and since it's so light, it installs easily. OK, the remote is the only way to make adjustments, so? Get one with mechanical controls. The remote takes a small disk battery that are inexpensive and found anywhere batteries are sold, so keep a spare handy. The battery seems to last a very long time before needing replacement. Just replace it once a year and you'll be OK for the year. I didn't expect top-of-the-line features or functionality at this price, so I'm not disappointed with it.

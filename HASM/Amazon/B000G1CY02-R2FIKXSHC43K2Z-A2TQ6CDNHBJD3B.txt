Title: RATED BEST PICK BY CONSUMER REPORTS
Content:
After intensive research I purchased this heater instead of an Edenpure. Very happy. I really can't believe an Edenpure could be $300 better than this unit. At first we thought it was a dud. You don't get instant "wow that's hot" heat. But, after it had a few hours to get the house to temp, we were cozy. We close off our rooms & only heat our 500 sq ft living kitchen area (with vaulted ceilings) Our furnace is set at 65-67 & doesn't kick on anymore. The temp in the home is 72 and comfortable, not drafty. For the first time ever, I can walk around not all bundled up and enjoy a movie not under a pile of blankets. I am sensitive to noise so we bought this unit that doesn't have a fan/blower, so we just keep our ceiling fan on the low-winter setting. Slim design is also a plus in our small home. Wall mounting option is also great to keep kids/pets from hurting themselves. I have found nothing about this heater that I don't like.

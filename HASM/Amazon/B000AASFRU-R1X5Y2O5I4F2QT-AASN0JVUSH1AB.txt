Content:
I'm torn. I have a Miele Orion and I like it very well  so far, but I have had problems with the radio frequency controls on the handle. In my case, the battery would drain every two weeks or so. I took it back to the shop and they were able to swap out the part for a new one under warranty.
The new handle part has a modified design. Formerly, the buttons for power and suction stood just a little bit proud of the handle, and now, on the new part, there is a molded ridge around the buttons. I suspect that the original design allowed the buttons to get pressed inadvertently while the vac stood in a crowded closet, which caused the battery to drain.
I don't know if Miele made other, internal changes to the design, but the new part is working well so far. I'm keeping my fingers crossed, because I like the vacuum otherwise. It might be safer to choose a different Miele S4 model because of the RF control problems, but, on the other hand, I really appreciate the convenience of the handle-mounted controls.

Title: Not Very Good
Content:
I purchased this heater about 5 months ago before it started getting cold. Once the cold set in I started using this unit and and the first few weeks were fine. About 4 weeks into using the heater it started turning off by itself and turning on again minutes later. Now its to the point where it turns off literally every other minute its on and it stays off for about 10 minutes. Needless to say its not doing its job as a heater and if I could return it I would.

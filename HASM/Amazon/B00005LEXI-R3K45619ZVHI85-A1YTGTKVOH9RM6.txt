Title: Mr. Heater MH9B 9,000 BTU Portable Buddy Propane Heater
Content:
I bought the heater for use in an RV who's furnace was broke, I needed something quicker than furnace repairs allowed so tried this with skepticism. I didn't think this single heater would be able to keep up. Although it's only a 25-ft RV, it was in farily cold climate and this heater kept it more than warm. It worked just as advertised. The only draw back it has is there's no thermostat so it's on or off, which they make clear in their advertising. I've only used it one weekend so can't comment on longevity, but I can say the first time it performed exaclty as it says it will.

Title: Love at first sight
Content:
I became adicted to photography with my 40D and after a year or so I started to see it's limitations. So I made the leap and bought the 5Dm2 and have been in love ever since. There are many technical reviews here and I recommend reading them all. This camera is not for everyone.
 
Who this is for (in my humble opinion):
   - Those that primarily shoot in low light situations.
       - the benefits from full frame and the 5D's amazing ISO
         capabilities are amazing. I have pics at 3200 ISO with no noise.
   - Portrait photographers.
       - The picture quality is unbeatable (unless you tack on an 
         additional couple grand or more for the 1D)
       - The 21.2 Mp gives you so much room to play with
Those who this may not be the best option:
   - Sports photographers!
       - I still use my 40D for those senarios where I want a lot
         of fps. and reach. While the picture will always be better
         with the 5Dm2, 3.9fps is very slow in my opinion. Just 
         something to consider.
       - The full frame vs crop factor is interesting and you will
         see it first hand when you put your lenses on this baby.
         My 70-200 just became a walk around lense and has forced
         me to beg my wife to buy the 100-400 and a 2x extender. My
         17-40 just became an amazing wide angle.
Maybe it's just me but it seems that all of my lenses are so much sharper than before.
So, that is my humble opinion. This camera is all that it's cracked up to be and I haven't even talked about the video capabilities. Definitely worth the money.

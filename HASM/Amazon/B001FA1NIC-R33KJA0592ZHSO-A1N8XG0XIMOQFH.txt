Title: Fustrating would be a good  word
Content:
I got this  yesterday and it is going back today.  It is  a  complete hassle  to load and use.  I  loaded  100 mp3's which run on any other  mp3 player and this machine says I have  one song on it.  It  will not see other entries and  it is NOT  intuitive for those of us that do not have several  hours to  figure it all out.   My one adventure with Apple will probably be my last.    P.S. I  dislike having a special  USB cable end such that it can not be shared with any other piece of equipment.

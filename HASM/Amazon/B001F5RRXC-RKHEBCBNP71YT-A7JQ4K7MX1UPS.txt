Title: Poor Product, Poor Cust Service
Content:
Bought it from Sam's in Nov in prep for winter. First used it end of Dec and Jan 30th the ocillator died.  I've made two phone calls - only get recording stating they are open from 9 to 5 eastern and two emails. No response to anything as of yet......and not able to get it to move...grrrrrr.

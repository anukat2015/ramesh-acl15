Title: Better Than Expected!!! I Love It!
Content:
We got the original version of this product for a wedding present 9 years ago and it just finally died... and we are thrilled to find a replacement!!!  We LOVE LOVE LOVE this coffee maker! I read the other negative reviews and wonder if people expected this thing to be self-cleaning or something other than what it is when you have dry grinds near a water source...  but we got exactly what we wanted and expected and we LOVE it!!!

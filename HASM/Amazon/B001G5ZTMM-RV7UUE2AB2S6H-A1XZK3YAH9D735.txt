Title: The review I was looking for
Content:
First, you can buy the body for 2600 from most stores/online, I dont know why Amazon is charging 3K. 
Let me give a quick rundown so you know where I am coming from. I am a serious amateur, did film photography (developed my own film:-) ) for 1 year in HS, then took 5-6 years camera free, and the last 3-4 years with a 30D. I like to shoot anything really: landscapes, macro and plants (my favorites), followed by animals, birds (70/30 rest vs flight), and people/portraits. No sports. I prefer B&W. I use the camera for my own enjoyment/photography practice and at parties and school club events, and lots of travel. It gets a pretty well rounded tour of duty. I had from a 30D before, which I loved. So let me get to the nitty gritty. 
(BTW, if you are looking for pixel peeping, you won't get it here. I'm looking to add a more detail and subjective feel of using the camera, and answer the questions I had before I bought.  I shoot primes and have 2Ls, so IQ is limited by my skill. I have slightly more money than sense, and I am very anal about noise and IQ.)
I've had the 5D mkII for about 2-3 weeks and have only taken about 100-150 images with it I would say. Sorry, I've been busy!
#Image Quality/Megapixels
Out of this world. The images look very, very real. I don't know what else to say. Smooth colors and grades. Deep blacks. Colors comes out just how I remember them. Noise performance is great, super clean until 800, even 1600 ISO (by my standards. I used to hate anything above 400).. It is clearly aimed at people who like to print large, hi-res, fine art style work. Unfortunately the noise is that weird Canon stuff, but its not as bad as I feared, and could pass for film grain. I can shoot handheld indoors with very good results. 21 megapixels is WAY more than I want; but I can crop to my hearts content and still print big! I can actually crop images to "the exact same" frame that my 30D would have taken and have more MP... thats actually what pushed me over the edge to buy.  Unforutately my 2.4 Ghz imac converts the RAW files very slowly. Editing is still fast enough. There is some debate online that as printers are able to print at higher and higher dpi, higher MP counts may make a difference. I agree with this, but only insofar as a medium format vs 35mm difference; 8mp will always look great at the common print sizes. PS: Canon, hire some of Nikons engineers to fix the look of your noise....
#AF system
It would have been nice to have new one, but my 30D AF never really failed me, and this is basically the same. For the money I would have REALLY liked to have the upgrade. Yet since it never hindered me before, and I don't shoot sports or BIF often, it's ok by me. People really complain about this, but seriously...the nine points system IS old, but it works and works well enough. To be honest I would rather have the last iteration of a proven AF than the first generation of a new one.
#Build quality
The slightly bigger size feels much more balanced, and "right", than the 30D. My 30D went shooting at glaciers, rain forest, jungle, and forests and in snow, rain, heavy fog, sand etc etc and didn't miss a beat, albeit in only 3 years. With upgraded seals, I have no doubts about this 5DII. The "real" weather seal of the 1D would  be great, but I don't go shooting in downpours or sandstorms.
#Full frame vs 1.6
I really miss my 1.6 free zoom factor, especially when it comes to macro. A lot of my shooting is "screwed up" now, and I have to readjust. But it feels good to be so wide and landscapes are looking great. I'm gonna pick up a long zoom and I should be fine. It is mostly hard to adjust because the 100mm macro on the 1.6 was a real joy to use (BTW, that lens has given me the most keepers per dollar of anything, buy one if you are debating it).
#Movie mode/live view
Live view is great for macro. The video capability is great and very fun, and it is easy to focus manually with the large screen. I was concerned about having to focus in movie mode, but I like it more than the AF. Even on camcorders the AF isn't great. I guess I might use it video once in a while sitting in the airport or for Grandpa blowing out the candles. The video looks great, having the lens capability and shallow DoF is cool...but I barely have enough time to edit my photos, let alone a video. All jokes aside, its useful and nice and a welcome addition; its better to have than not, especially for quick little moments.
 
#Odds and Ends
-The viewfinder is great. I really feel like I am looking through the lens; my 30D feels like a peephole now.
-The AF matrix looks smaller to me, but I can't be certain. I don't know if the spread stays the same as the sensor size increases, but it certainly feels like it. 
-AF micro adjust lets me be sure my lenses are spot on (5/7 were), the dust shake is nice too.
-RF remote capability is a plus
-Rear screen is sharp sharp sharp!
-Its great to have more battery bars; the life is excellent, and now more accurate.
-Finally, I don't have all those silly automatic modes on my dial, except for the new Creative Auto. Really.
-If you care about the lack of onboard flash....1. Onboard flash sucks. Buy a real one (I have a 430EX and its good enough) you will thank yourself. 2. You can shoot handheld in low light with this baby anyways. If its dim, ISO has you covered, if its dark, use the external; the onboard wouldn't cut it then. There is an AF assist lamp on board, but it hasn't fired yet.
-Viewfinder blackout is noticeably longer than my 30D; the change in shutter lag is not.
#My complaints
-FPS: 4fps on a 2600 dollar "pro" camera? If you shoot sports or birds a lot, stick with the 3/4/50D unless you really want full frame. Or wait for the rumoured 7D/3D. 4 fps is great for once in a while users (like me) though. I don't really mind it. If anything it teaches me to be better about timing.
-Why does the camera not have a built in intervelometer? thats stupid. It has enough screen and processing power to do it.
-I can't delete Picture styles: Canon has downloadable styles to use in your 3 custom modes. I shoot RAW, so they are meaningless, but I still want them. Unfortunately I can't delete the default ones I don't use so I can have only my favorites. I would have to transfer the settings manually somehow...and record the defaults.
-The controls: ok, this REALLY steams my clams. Canon has the big control wheel. I love it. But for some reason they have decided to make the control stick the center of their new (to me) menu system. It is small, awkward, far away, and slow.  Furthermore, the wheel scrolls up and down: why? Left and right would be far more useful (since there are more menus in that direction; 9 vs 5). You lose 3/4 of a star for this Canon. I am a perfectionist. Perfect score means perfect camera, and small things count.
-They have this newfangled menu thing that shows all the camera settings at once on the rear screen and you can change all of them. Unfortunately, the top LCD already shows me the info, and using the screen is slower than using the buttons and the wheels. Its useful at night, so I dont have to push the light button though. If you set it to work with the info button (a Custom Function), it is VERY hard (for me at least) to get out of. I don't really like it but its starting to grow on me.
-The button for the top light is recessed and I have to try pushing it a few times to get it to work. Hopefully its just my copy. Minus 1/4 star because I shoot a lot in dimly lit areas.
-Please be aware sRAW (you can shoot RAW at less MP if you want; it is called an sRAW file) does not work on Aperture yet(!)
#Why I gave it 4 stars and not 5
I would have given it 5 stars if not for the illogical change to the menu controls (I hate wasting time in menu-land) and the poor light button. And the lack of intervelometer. I would also like to tell Canon, if by the grace of god you are reading this, that I have an app on my iphone that calculates the hyperfocal distance, something landscape shooters love. On your pro landscape/studio body, can you not BUILD IN this table/formula into the menu? even better, have the camera set the lens AT the hyperfocal distance? I know it already has all the data it needs to read that table. THAT would be be every landscape shooter dream come true. 
#Bottom line: 
If you are willing to give up the crop factor/free zoom and the FPS (I prefer to thinking of it as "back in the day" performance with closer to "back in the day" level of resolution), the 5d mkII will blow your mind. Parties, portraits, kids, pets, animals, sunsets, interiors...you are covered. If you were waiting to go to FF...you won't be disappointed. I feel this is close to film for me.
If you shoot BIF, sports, far away animals...you may want to save those upgrade dollars for now. You will be paying to lose zoom and FPS, and the 50D/40D has pretty good noise performance and IQ from what I read.
If you have a 5D already, I can't really give any advice since I've never used it.
If you have a 3/4/50D and REALLY want to go to FF, think carefully about what kind of shooting you do, then wait until Dec and see if the 3D/7D comes out. I blew my money early, I didn't know about that rumor. Other cameras I considered were a 1DMkII, but the screen is small, its huge, heavy and I would feel like even more of a poser with it, plus I use the screen and crop tool a lot more than max FPS. I also checked out the 5d original, but again, screen too small, DIGIC II, no sensor clean, no lens micro adjust...
If you are just getting into dSLR, get a 40D (same as a 50D basically), or heck, a 30D (I love mine) and get some nice glass. Unless you are rich, then get this. Or if you have small hands, then get the Tl1/XTi.
Rumor has it there is something coming to "fill the gap" for anyone looking to go up from the 50D, but not wanting a 5D or the pricier 1DMkIII or its s verison. It would be ~15mp, ~7fps, and ~the same image quality, and likely FF or 1.3 crop, with a new, better point AF.  I think this is possible, but there are reasons for and against this (ie somewhere for the 50D sports shooter to upgrade to without going to 1D/everyone wants this vs Why would a sports/BIF shooter want to lose the 1.6 crop for comparable IQ?  Esp since Canon is due to upgrade the "aging" xxD AF, which will be the "7D" everyone wants without cannabilizng the 1DmkIII). 
I would maybe want that gap filler, mostly to ease the strain on my computer and keep that high FPS (its a guy thing, need for speed). But computers improve too, and I am VERY happy with the 5dmkII, I may cast an envious eye when/if this 3d/7d comes (Dec?) but I won't be selling or thinking twice.
IMO, a classic camera.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
I've had this heater for a little over 6 months and use it only sporadically at work.  Now it won't work at all.  It stays on for about 30 seconds (if that) and auto shuts off.  I've done everything the instructions tell me in order to remedy the problem and nothing works.  I'm freezing at my desk...looking for a new heater online.

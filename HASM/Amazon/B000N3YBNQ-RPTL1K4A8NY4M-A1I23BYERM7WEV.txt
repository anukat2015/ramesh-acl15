Title: Awesome Vacuum!
Content:
I have had Electrolux vacuums throughout my life, but this one is the best! I love the small size and the way it folds to fit in a small area for storage. The suction is amazing. If I were forced to find something less than perfect about it, then it would be the 20ft cord. I'm too lazy to unplug and plug in again when I move to a different room!

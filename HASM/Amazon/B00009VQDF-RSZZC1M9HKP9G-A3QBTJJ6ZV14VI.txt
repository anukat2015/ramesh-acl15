Title: LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!
Content:
I've used this camera for almost 10 years and it's just about perfect!  I am an amature but I am always hearing about the professional quality of my pictures! People are always amazed when I say, "I just point and shoot! The camera does all the work for me!" =)
Nikon is a relieable quality company and they offer 24 hour support! You will be very pleased! =)

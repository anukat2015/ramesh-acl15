Title: A lot of music in a little package
Content:
It's amazing the amount of music you can download and the sound quality.  However, it's almost a little too small (I liked the size of my 1st Generation Shuffle better).  When I go to move it around at the gym, I'm constantly hitting the "Pause" button or the "Fast Forward/Fast Rewind" buttons.  But those are little things.  It's still great for working out.

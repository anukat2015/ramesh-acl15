Title: GOOD HEATER - Don't Let The Smelly Reviews Turn You Off
Content:
Very happy with this heather.  I am glad I read the reviews about the 'smell' when first used.  There is also a warning in the package.
I turned it on in a spare room with the window open and it stopped smelling after an hour or two (and the smell was not nearly as bad as I expected).
All in all, very happy (and warm) so far.

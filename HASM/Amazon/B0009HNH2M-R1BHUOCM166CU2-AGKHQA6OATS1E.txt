Title: First Canister Vacuum, Happy with Purchase
Content:
This was our first canister vacuum purchase after having several upright models fail on us.  We were surprised at how lightweight it was, easy to use and it went together fast.  I love having the cord stored away when not in use and it works like a dream.  The bags are a big small, but that's our only complaint.  It picked up everything, including cat fur, which is our biggest carpet issue.  It swivels easily and fits under most anything without having to move furniture.  We are happy customers for sure!

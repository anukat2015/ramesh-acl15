Title: Just arrived!
Content:
I spent so much time researching a good canister vacuum cleaner purchase that I decided to write.The other two reviews were very helpful so I wanted to give something back. Because I saw how much can cost a set of bags for some vacuums, I decided to look for a bagless canister vacuum. I have more wood floor that carpet. Please understand this review covers just the first week. Since the machine just arrived. I like that is bagless, and the fact that the cylinder is transparent, you can see how much dirty sucks up from the floor! Easy to take off the dust. Strong handgrip features electronic control buttons for power on and off, variable suction.Tools are easily attached to the telescoping wand made in metal. Not very noisy. I little heavy, but it gives you a feeling that it is more well made with strong material.

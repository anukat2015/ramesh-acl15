Title: Excellent price/performance
Content:
I received this laptop (can't really call it a netbook with a dual-core and 4GB of RAM) last week after about a week of deliberation over the other options out there.  In this 11.6" range, there's a pretty limited number of models to compare.  If you're willing to pay another hundred dollars and up, you could get a faster processor.  Likewise, you can find a cheaper laptop with a celeron or atom processor.  At this price point, however, this laptop really does stand out.
The trackpad does take some getting used to, but most of the complaints about it (like the zooming gestures) can be disabled in a few seconds.  The battery does stick out pretty ridiculously, but I would gladly trade that for the 6+ hours of battery life.  The video card is very basic, but once again this is a sub-$500 laptop in a very slim form factor.  Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, and I'm quite happy with my purchase.

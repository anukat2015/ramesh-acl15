Title: Good design with mediocre sound quality
Content:
Well, everything was said already:
pros:  Compact design, battery life, 8G
Cons: touch pad is not perfect ...  BUT BUT BUT
For those who care about sound above all:
This toy can play loud - better that any iPod yet I was really dissapointed from its mediocre bass performance.  It soulds like it can not play a clean Bass sound - it sounds distorted and it smears the rest of the spectrum.
That's not the way I like my player to sound.

Title: More Than I Could Wish For!!!
Content:
I have used many different point and shoot cameras.  My father owned a photo studio and has many film SLR's laying around the house, several of which I shot with from time to time.  I always looked to make the upgrade to a DSLR but couldn't afford it.  Finally, I started making some money and a DSLR was one of the first things on my wish list, though I still have a fairly low income.
This camera has been amazing.  I have owned it for one month now and every day I get better at shooting with it. 
Pros:
8 Megapixle sensor is high resolution but no so high as to kill your computers hard drive
The camera is light weight and fairly small
The kit lens is suprisingly good
For the beginning DSLR shooter the price is unbeatable considering the quality of camera
Canon EF lenses are an investment worth making because they fit the entire range of Canon DSLRs
Manual functions are fantastic
Dedicated settings screen
Great battery life
Cons:
The 8MP sensor isn't the highest on the markets (see Rebel XTi)
The cameras light weight body feels slightly cheap
No spot meter
Small viewing screen on rear
Slightly out of date (for price this is a plus)
Slightly slow burst of 3fps with a total of 9 burst shots on full res.
One last note:  I bought the Amazon Warehouse "refurbished" model.  I saved around 50 clams from "new".  I can see no difference between it and a "new" one.  Everything is perferct.

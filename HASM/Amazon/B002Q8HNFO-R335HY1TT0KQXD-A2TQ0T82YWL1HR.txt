Title: Impressive
Content:
Bought one for the Mrs. & my daughter was so impressed, she bought one for herself.  This laptop is fast!  I'm impressed with Windows 7 also.  I've seen comments regarding the plastic case.  If you check them out, almost all laptops have fully plastic cases.  Some are just colored to look like they're made from aluminum.  For the money, and with its' features, this is the best value I've seen in a laptop.

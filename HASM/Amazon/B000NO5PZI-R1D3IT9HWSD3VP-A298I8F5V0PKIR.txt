Title: Wasted Money
Content:
I've had this vacuum for just over a year.  It doesn't pick up stuff, when it does it gets caught in any one of several places that require manual cleaning to dislodge the clumps of junk.  The worst place is the hose directly behind the roller.  It clogs easily and is difficult to disconnect then reconnect.  This was quite possibly the worst vacuum I've ever bought.

Title: Very nice machine
Content:
Bought this Electolux model after going through two Sears Progressive units in three years (even though they were highly rated by Consumer Reports)  Their quality and durability was horrible.
This new Electolux is a very nice machine.  Only negatives I would identify is that the power carpet sweeper is noiser than most.  Also the size of the dust collector bag is quite small & will require more frequent changing.
However unit works great; controls are handy and easy to use.  Unit is light and compact, easy to use and attractive.  If the carpet power sweeper was quieter, I would give it five stars.  You won't go wrong buying this unit.

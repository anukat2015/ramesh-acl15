Title: NOT VERY PLEASED
Content:
I bought the d50 a few days before Christmas and started shooting immediately and am moderately pleased with it.  After reading over 100 of the reviews, I believe now my camera might be faulty.  In some of the preset modes the button is not reactive as it should be b/c there's about a 3/4 to 1 second delay...and only occasionally.
MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT is about the built-in flash......it fires off but in the picture doesn't show any trace of a flash.  The flash is firing 100% of the time (I think) it's supposed to.  About 60% of the time, the picture that is taken when the flash is firing shows zero indication that there was even a flash involved.  I have checked all of the settings, done both a hard reset (twice) and several soft resets to no avail.  I know about the different flash settings for slow and rear and curtains and such but all settings I try do not change anything.  This "phenomena" is not confined to one or two settings; this problem occurs on every auto setting a flash can fire in.  I think it might be a timing problem internally somehow.
I think if I can get these two problems squared away, I will definitely be one of the over 100 satisfied owners of the D50.
Feel free to comment if you think there is something I can try to fix these problems.

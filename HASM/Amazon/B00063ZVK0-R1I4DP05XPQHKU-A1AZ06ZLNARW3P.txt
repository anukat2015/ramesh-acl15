Title: Vornado broke after 40 days
Content:
This device failed after about 40 days. During the time I had it, the device
did not seem to generate much heat.  Based on my experience, I would not buy again. I just checked on-line - the device has a 30 day warranty if purchased
fom Vornado.  You've got to ask what sort of a manufacturer only provides
a 30 day warranty...  Seems like other have had poor experience with quality issues.

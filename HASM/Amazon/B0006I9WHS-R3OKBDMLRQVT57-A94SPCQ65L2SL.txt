Title: Not perfect but gets the job done
Content:
I've had this heater for about 2 months now. Some pros and cons;
Pro: It heats my (somewhat small) room very quickly. There is no odor and the sound is tolerable, like a weak blow dryer. It can make it hard to hear the tv but it's not nail-in-the-chalkboard distracting or anything like that. I could personally sleep through the noise, not loud at all.
Cons: As other people have mentioned the dial dosen't have temps on it and no off button (so you have to pull the plug). My biggest complaint would be that after working fine for a few weeks it suddenly had a minor problem. The problem is after the initial gust of warm air (which works perfectly) the second, third and so on gust has a hard time coming on. Like it turns on then quickly turns off then turns on then quickly turns off then finally it turns on. Almost like it's short-circuiting or something. To be clear this is not a fatal flaw or a serious problem but it is extremely distracting. It's so distracting that I now just turn it on full blast, get the room warm then just take the plug out of the outlet. I find it easier to just manually do this instead of relying on the heater's temperature control. Hope that made sense. 
Final Verdict: I'm very happy with the heater despite its flaws and it rescued me from a very cold winter. My advice would be if you just want a cheap heater that will warm your room and you're not super-picky about the temp control or lack of off-button or some other minor flaws then buy this heater.
UPDATE: My heater is barely working now, it's been about a year since I bought it. I don't know if anyone else has this problem but I wouldn't count on this heater to last beyond one winter.

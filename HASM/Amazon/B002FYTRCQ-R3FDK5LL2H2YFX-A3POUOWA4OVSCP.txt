Title: Disappointed
Content:
Well, I got mine about 5 months ago, so it isn't that old.  I have a combo of hard wood and area carpets; the living room has a room-sized area carpet.  At first I was pleased, it worked great for the first month or so.  Then it all went downhill.  Where do I even begin?  It has almost no suction power.  I watch in frustration as rather than sucking up debris, it pushes it around on the floor.  I have always regularly cleaned out the hoses and emptied the canister to make sure it isn't clogged, but still no suction.  I'd say if you have pets, you don't want this thing.  We have two cats, and the weather has been cold so they aren't even shedding as much.  I am constantly stopping to pick the collected fur out of the carpet brush.  You can't then feed it into the vacuum because it will clog the hose, so I pick the fur out of the brush and set it aside; when I'm done I have a big ball of fur and dirt.  Yuck.  The clog light doesn't work.  It comes on when the thing isn't clogged, and doesn't come on when it is.  There are always things left over on the floor when I'm done, which is frustrating as I have a 9 month old who wants to put everything in his mouth.  Every time I need to use it I just end up infuriated; all in all I'm very disappointed.  The only thing I like about it is how lightweight it is; it's easy to carry up and down stairs. But I would say unless you only rarely need to vacuum, you don't want this thing!  Any amount of regular use and it will not last!

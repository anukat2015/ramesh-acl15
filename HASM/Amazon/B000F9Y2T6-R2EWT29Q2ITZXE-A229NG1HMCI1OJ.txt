Title: So far, so good!
Content:
I just got my Flip It yesterday and after a trial run I am very pleased! I have Pergo laminate floors and I have tried everything out there from different mops to steamers and every cleaner under the sun and no matter what I have to wipe them with a towel or they are streaked with water marks. Even my ceramic tile in the bathrooms needs to be wiped or I get water marks. Well, NO MORE!!! I can tell that it takes some trial and error to use the machine correctly but after testing it yesterday my floors were shining! No streaks or water marks! The vacuum part is not the best so I will continue to use my regular vacuum beforehand. Not a big deal I think, since you have to vacuum using a conventional mop anyway. But washing the floor was just like "vacuuming" it to a shine! Finally, I don't dread washing the floors!!

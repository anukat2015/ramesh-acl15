Title: Best money I ever spent!
Content:
I actually have a previous make of this Vornado Heater (same everything but no med setting); and it has to be the best purchase I ever made.
I got it on a strong recommendation of a coworker who used it to heat his bathroom in a large house.
But I actually use it to hit my smallish (large for NYC) 200 sqft bedroom.
It's in a prewar building so the windows don't insulate (and sometimes actually frost over in the inside!)
But the heater does a great job of keeping the room comfortable even then.
Only minor con is that it smells like a burning hair for the first few minutes when I have it on a high setting.  May be because of the dust bunnies roaming my apartment, and I neeed to clean it up...
I've read that it's broken down for some people, but I've been using it for almost 4 years now and no problems!

Title: Good Value
Content:
I succomed to the pressure.  I felt bad about cooking my coffee after brewing, so I upgraded to a thermal coffee maker.  
After some initial research, I decided I did not want a unit that ground the coffee as well.  This unit fits the bill.  My only regret is that there is no filter.  For this price, I can do without.  I could use the filtered water from my refrigerator, but according to Doug's review, the water would be too cold to brew the perfect cup of coffee.  I will just have to decalcify the unit often.
The coffee is hot and good and stays that way because of the thermal carafe.  I can now keep a fresh pot of coffee an entire morning.  The unit is easy to operate.  Cleaning is a bit more involved than I like because everything must be hand washed.  
The best thing about the unit is the physical design. The footprint is smaller than traditional coffee makers.  You'll actually gain counter space!

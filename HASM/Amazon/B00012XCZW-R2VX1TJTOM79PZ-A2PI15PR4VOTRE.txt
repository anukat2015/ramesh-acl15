Title: great coffee in three minutes!
Content:
Until we bought this coffee maker, we only brewed coffee on the weekend at home.  We would wait until we got to work to have our first cup because the previous coffee maker we had, which was a grind and brew, took 20 - 30 minutes to brew even a half pot of coffee and we didn't have that kind of time on a work day morning.  But now, we make coffee several times during the week, as well as the weekend, and the coffee is just as good, or better than the same brand of coffee that took 20 minutes to brew in the other machine!  In the time that you brush your teeth, the coffee is done, and steaming hot, and ready when you are!

Title: Endless touchpad hardware problems
Content:
I bought this notebook. At first it seemed to me fabulousbut then I discovered it has hardware problems with the touchpad like explained by other reviewers: touchpad clicking continuoslyon its own , going up, down etc..Sony should do something about this, as most of v505 ownershave this kind of problems ! Also I found the case is of bad quality, just plastic.Don't trust pictures and go touch goods before buying.

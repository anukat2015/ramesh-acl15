Title: Nice 'starter' iPod
Content:
I bought this iPod for my 14 yo son.  It is his very first iPod and he loves it.  It and iTunes are easy to use and we were both pleasantly surprised to learn there are several very fun game apps that he can get for it.  It took quite awhile for iTunes to convert all the music files he had, but aside from the time we were glad that it is an automated process which needed little user-interaction to happen.

Title: Best Low Cost solution!!!
Content:
I recently moved into a small home that had issues to say the least! My Heater was not allowed to be on until the owner made some repairs so I needed a quick and easy solution. I purchased this little guy and absolutely love it. Not only does it heat my master bedroom extremely well, it also was nothing more than a blip on my electric bill. Also, the single most important thing is that you can touch the screen on the front of it even after weeks of use and it is not hot to the touch! I highly recommend this product for it's ease of use, safety and overall quality!

Title: I am So VERY disappointed
Content:
I decided to step up my game and damage my pocket and purchase an Apple laptop and software. This is because people said this was the ideal if doing video production (and that is my dream). Since getting the thing and installing the software I have had problems. My imovie would not work...i kept having to force quit the programme...i took the laptop software etc to the Apple dealer in the Country and they reinstalled and charged me for this...took the laptop home and now the iphoto keeps hanging up. It seems i would have been better of not going the Apple route as I am yet to get ANY value for the money I paid.

Title: Solid performer, just a few catches.
Content:
The D40x is a 10 megapixel upgrade to their popular D40 camera (6mp), and this package features the same 18-55 zoom.
As with it's 6mp twin, the D40x is one of the smallest DSLRs on the market, but is shaped as well for the hands as any of the smaller series (such as the Canon XTi).  Trade-offs for the smaller size are a less powerful battery and a smaller viewfinder.
Another strong feature is the editing you can do in the camera itself after you've taken the picture.  This is truly handy if you're on the road but need to make some prints for clients or family.
Compared to the slightly more expensive Canon XTi, the D40x's AF system is a very simple 3-point system vs. 9-point for the Canon.  Since focusing a metering are also tied together, this might give the Canon an edge in more difficult lighting situations.  Additionally, the Canon offers a sensor cleaning feature lacking on all Nikons.  The Canon, however, does not have the editing featues of the D40x.  These two will be joined at 10mp, very small DSLR, by the Olympus Evolt E-410.
The only catch for the D40x is that it does not feature a focusing motor inside the body.  That pretty much limits your selection of autofocusing lenses to some Nikon and a few Sigma lenses today.  Nikon's own 55-200 VR is a terrific value, if it's enough range, but there are no $200 AF 75-300 zooms that will work in autofocus today.  If you have older Nikon AF lenses, you might look at the larger but superior D80, which still features the motor in the body.
A very nice, small DSLR, at a very reasonable price.  And the pictures are pretty darn good, too!

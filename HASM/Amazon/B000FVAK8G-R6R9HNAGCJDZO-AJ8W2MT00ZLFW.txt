Title: So sad it broke!
Content:
We loved ours!  A lot of the people who are having problems with it shutting itself off randomly are probably playing with the middle button on the unit - it is some kind of timer. We never used it, but realized when we had the same problem.
Our problem is that the oil pan must have burst or something - I came into the kitchen one day and there was a brown puddle on the floor and the thermostat was registering 90 degrees.  So thankful it didn't catch on fire or anything, but if it hadn't been on linoleum it would have left a nasty mess on the carpet.  Returned it to the store no problem, but we were unable to replace it with the same model as it was not in stock.

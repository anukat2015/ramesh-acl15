Title: wouldn't buy it again
Content:
The first one I bought had a faulty cord.  It wouldn't stay out and kept trying to wind up.  After a quick exchange at Target I realized that the cord is way too short.  I am constantly unplugging it and trying to find a closer outlet.  Now, less than a year later my hose just snapped!  A replacement hose will cost me over $20 becuase it only comes in a pack with the tube.  I think I will just throw it in storage for now.  Not worth spending more money.

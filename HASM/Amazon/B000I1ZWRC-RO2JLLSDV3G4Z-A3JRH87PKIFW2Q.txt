Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Black Body Only)
I love this camera! The ease of use and the simplicity of the buttons and placement of all the controls. I have added the Opteka battery grip to my XTi and have had no problems with either. I like that it has the dust removal option. I try not to let dust into the camera body, but anyone who changes lenses knows that it is an almost impossible thing to do.
I have recently purchased 3 L series lenses, and with the XTi, I can get print sizes of 53"x36". As this is the high end of the "Beginner" series of Canon DSLR's, I find that this camera does an amazing job at what it was designed for.

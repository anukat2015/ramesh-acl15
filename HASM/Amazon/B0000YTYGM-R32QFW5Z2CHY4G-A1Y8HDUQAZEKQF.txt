Content:
Background:  I originally purchased my wife a single cup coffee maker for Christmas a couple years ago after our old coffee maker was having issues.  She decided she didn't want a single cup maker and she did a lot of research on Amazon.  Eventually, we decided on this model.
This has been one of the best coffee makers we've ever owned.  First, the thermal carafe keeps coffee warm without destroying the flavor.  The first cup isn't much different from the last.  If you warm up the pot before brewing--by filling with hot water and draining before brewing--it will stay warm an entire day.  Plus, there's something to be said for being able to leave the house and not worrying about whether or not you left the coffee pot on.
That said, there are a few idiosyncrosies that have been duly noted in other reviews; overflow, mess if not properly seated and screwing in the carafe top. We've had experience with them all, but they're minor annoyances at best (except for the mess when the pot isn't seated right).  
The only thing I would add is that the top is somewhat difficult to clean.  If you take it apart, it can be challenging to make sure no parts are lost.  If it's left intact to rinse out at day's end, it never seems to get clean, and that causes coffee stain accumulation that won't come out unless it's soaked or taken apart.
Overall, a great product, especially if it's on sale.  If it wasn't for the few issues, it would certainly be 5 star.  All things being equal, we would purchase again.

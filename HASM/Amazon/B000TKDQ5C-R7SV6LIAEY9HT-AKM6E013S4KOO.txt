Title: Two modes.  On or off.  Thermostat is useless.
Content:
This heater is good at keeping a room warm.  However, the thermostat is pretty useless.  It seems to be either always on or always off.  If I put the knob in the middle before I go to bed on a cold night, I'll wake up in the middle of the night in a sauna.  It will not turn off after it reaches the temperature I would like.  Also, it will not turn on after the temperature drops to a certain level.  I would like to be able to set it at night and not have to keep getting up to turn it on and off.

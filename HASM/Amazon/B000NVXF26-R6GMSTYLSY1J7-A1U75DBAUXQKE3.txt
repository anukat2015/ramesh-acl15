Title: Terrific travel DSLR
Content:
I'm a long time photographer that places high value on construction quality and ergonomics,  My original search lead me to a Panasonic DMC-L1 and nothing I looked at in the $1000-$2000 range had the quality feel and traditional ergonomics of the L1.  For studio work I love the L1 but its size and weight make it a less ideal travel companion.
One of the original premises of the 4/3 system was being able to offer high quality pictures from a system that was less expensive, smaller, and lighter.  Olympus seems to be offering several products that fit that premise.  The latest being the E-510
The E-510 body is relatively light, very rigid and sturdy, with a quality feel.  The two kit lenses (14-42 and 45-150) have the same cheap, horrid feel of other "kit" lenses, but these are considerably smaller and lighter and of higher optical quality than most.  This two lens kit is capable of very high quality pictures over a large zoom range, while not taking up much space or weighing much.  Its ideal for travel where you want a DSLR instead of a SuperZoom.  Olympus offers plenty of high quality lenses and accessories if you want to make this kit the basis for a much larger system.  I've added an 18-180 lans and Fl36 flash to mine so far.
The E-510 is as capable as anything else in its price range.  Why would you or wouldn't you want to purchase it over its competition?
Pro's
- System small size, light weight, and high quality
- Effective Sensor self cleaning (don't underestimate this one)
- Sensor based Image Stabilization  (a bit less effective than lens based but much cheaper)
- Awesome battery life
- Live view
Con's
- 4/3 sensor smaller and intrinsically less sensitive than larger APS sensors
- 4/3 viewfinder a bit dimmer and smaller making manual focus more difficult
- Creative program modes not as well done as some of the competition
What's missing?
- An auto ISO that permits 800 and 1600
- A sports mode that senses movement and adjusts aperture and ISO to ensure a frozen image
- Permit base changes of creative mode settings (currently lost when you leave and reselect a creative mode)
All of these missing things could be addressed in a firmware upgrade.  Are you listening Olympus? ;-)

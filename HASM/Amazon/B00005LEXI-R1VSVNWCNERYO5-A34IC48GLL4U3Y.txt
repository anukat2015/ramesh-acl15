Title: Difference between F232025 and  F273400
Content:
There are currently two seemingly identical models currently listed on Amazon, the F232025 and the F273400. I contacted the manufacturer and verifed that the F232025 is the newest version. The F273400 was manufactured through 2008. For this reason, I'd recommend purchasing the F232025. It's also cheaper.
Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful.

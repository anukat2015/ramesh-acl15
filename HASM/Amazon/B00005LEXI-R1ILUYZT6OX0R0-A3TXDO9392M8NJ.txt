Title: Need a Buddy to Keep Your Warm?
Content:
The Buddy Heater is pretty cool, but using it indoors is still a little iffy in terms of ventilation.  If your power goes out, the last thing you want to do is crack a window to ventilate your living space.  But it's better than freezing.  I think it's better for camping uses, but it will do in a pinch if the power goes out on a long term basis.  Do be sure to ventilate the area though, and if you can, go for something that will help more on a long term basis.

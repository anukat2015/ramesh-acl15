Title: Excellent value
Content:
I live in a house with electric heating in each room. The heater in my bedroom doesn't work, so I ordered one of these. I could not be happier. It heats my bedroom in 10 - 15 minutes, even if the temperature in there is down to 50 degrees. I can't believe I suffered without a heater for this long.
I have it running for at least 3 - 5 hours a day, every day, and it's still trucking after a couple months. The cord doesn't get too warm on mine at all. The price is so low, that even if it only lasted one season I'd be happy to buy another next year. But there has been no sign of diminishing quality, lesser heat output, etc. Great value, does it's job well. I'm very pleased.

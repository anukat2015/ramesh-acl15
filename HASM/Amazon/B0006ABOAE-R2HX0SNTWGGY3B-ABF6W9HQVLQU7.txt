Title: BEWARE -- PIECE OF LEAKING JUNK
Content:
Maybe I just got a rare defective machine, but this coffee maker is the worst coffee maker I have ever purchased and overall a worthless piece of cr*p.  From Day One it has leaked EVERYWHERE, every time I try to use it, it leaks all over the counter, all over the floor, water not merely leaks out from everywhere, it POURS out from the bottom and the sides.  The design externally is nice -- it is a fairly compact nice size and looks very nice.  However I don't care how cute it is if if DOESN'T WORK.  It also has some bizarre design features such as this ultra-weird removable BUCKET that you have to fill with water for the coffee maker, and this bizarre "showerhead" feature over the filter basket, which if you don't swivel it into position each and every time, will pour further water all over the place.  Also, it is very easy to forget to put the first lid on the espresso machine before covering it with the second lid, which could result in some further disaster.  Overall, I rate this 5 stars for external frontal appearance and 0 for overall design.  It is possible I got a fluke defective one but even if it worked, I find the internal design of it bizarre and convoluted.  The only decent affordable coffee maker in my opinion is (was) the Braun, but that was before they started making them in Mexico and now those are cr*p too.

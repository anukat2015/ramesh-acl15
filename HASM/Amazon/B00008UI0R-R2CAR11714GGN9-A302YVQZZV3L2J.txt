Title: Great Vacuum~
Content:
I read all the consumer reports, and looked around online and found that this vac had lots of favorable reviews - so I bought one. I've been using it twice a week for a few months and so far it works wonderfully on my hardwood floors  - zipping up all the dust, dirt and cat hair. The filter works well and is easy to clean. The only problem is storage, as canister vacs take up lots more room than a standard upright.

Title: For my purpose, Awesome!
Content:
I purchased this item after perusing various space heaters, but purchased this DeLonghi model for the brand name, price and the design.  Frankly, the design of fan/coil space heaters look crude and dangerous despite the safety mechanisms.  Since this heater is an oil-filled radiator, its design lends itself to a greater sense of safety.  Since it is a radiator, it does work well in enclosed rooms, but lacks in open spaces.  Timer works well, whisper quiet and easily moved from room to room.  If your looking for specific directional heat, then purchase a fan based model.

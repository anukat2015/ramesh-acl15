Title: Multi-surface brush doesn't clean anywhere
Content:
There are basically two types of vacuum cleaners: upright and canister, and according to the Consumer Reports magazine, upright works better for cleaning carpeted floor while canister for hardwood floor.  I see the Panasonic's effort to combine two together adding the agitator in the head, but it was a terrible idea.  In fact, the multi-surface brush doesn't clean well for any types of surfaces: on carpeted floor the suction power is not enough and on hardwood floor the agitator spreads small pieces on the floor instead of sucking them.  In addition, the bulky head makes ugly black scratch marks all over from the baseboard moldings to linoleum.  To make more matters worse, the head was completely cut off from the hose today after only a year usage, which indicates its cheap quality.  I had to drag out my old half-broken Mighty Mites vacuum cleaner to clean my house instead and found out great joy to use the vacuum cleaner which simply sucks instead of spreading small pieces.

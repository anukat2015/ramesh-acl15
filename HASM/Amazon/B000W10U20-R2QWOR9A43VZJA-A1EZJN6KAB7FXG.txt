Title: DV2620US Laptop - excellent overall
Content:
I purchased the DV2620US in January to get a lighter, smaller laptop that could handle a lot of photos and video. At 5.4 pounds, the sleek unit is far lighter than my 15.4" Compaq. The dual-core processor speed is great - I have been able to process heavy-duty forensic analysis in minutes, while my classmates machines took up to an hour. No problem whatsoever with the wireless radio or bluetooth. I lug this laptop around daily in a backpack, and it shows no ill effects. The firewire interface enabled quick uploading of digital video, the DVD burner reliably produced the finished video productions. The SD slot is great for quickly uploading everyone's photos - under a minute to upload 70 photos. The BriteScreen makes the most of the 14.1 inches, and the photo slideshows and videos look crisp and clean. The mini remote control that fits into the expansion card slot is pretty clever. I am totally satisfied with the DV2620US laptop.

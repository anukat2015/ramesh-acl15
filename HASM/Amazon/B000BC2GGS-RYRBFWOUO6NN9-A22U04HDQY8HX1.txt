Title: Efficient and Quiet
Content:
We just moved into a home with no central heating so I've had the opportunity to buy three different space heaters in the past month.  This one is by far my favorite, and I actually just logged on to buy an additional one. This is the one I keep in my toddler's room because it is very quiet and even turns itself on and off quietly.  While I obviously don't want my child to touch it, I don't lie awake at night worrying about her touching this one - others I would.  It doesn't oscillate like some of the other heaters, but it heats her room so quickly that I don't miss that feature.  One more point, I recently bought something called the Heatrunner which has now blown a fuse two times in the past two days.  I have had no such problem with this Honeywell.  Happy Heating!

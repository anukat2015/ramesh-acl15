Title: Second Black and Decker disappointment
Content:
I bought this model by Black and Decker after I was bitterly disappointed with the first Black and Decker coffeemaker.  What a mistake!!!!  I like my coffee HOT and this model barely delivered mildly warm coffee.  The quality of the coffee was not good because the coffeemaker does not generate enough heat to pull the flavor through simple ground coffee.  I'm going back to Mr. Coffee.  I'm tired of wasting my money.

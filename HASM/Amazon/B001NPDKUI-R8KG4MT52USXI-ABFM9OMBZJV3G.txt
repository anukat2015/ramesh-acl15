No support, October 9, 2009 
By  Stan Tomberg (Hendersonville, NC) - See all my reviews
     
               
On 1/01/09 I called customer service (that is what they call it). I told the tech my internal lightscribe drive would not burn label's. I am not a not a novice and I went through all the steps - uninstalling the drive and reinstalling the drive, etc. I told the the tech that my external lightscribe drive was working fine so it had to be the drive. He had me duplicate all the steps I Had already done and after 1:05 he said he would send me a new drive it was under warranty got my credit card info and he put me on hold. After 10 minutes (1:15 total time) I hung up. 
I called back after I cooled down and got a tech who saw what was done, bur insisted to let him take over my PC. He assured me it take only 20 minutes and I agreed. An hour and 35 minutes later I told him just take of ordering the drive (it seems the first tech did not it. Hr agreed and then after being on hold for 5 minutes he told me the system was down and I would have to call back on 11/2/09. 
Both techs had bad attitudes and treated me like a dummy. I wasted two hours and 40 minutes of being insulted and talked down to! 
Price can not overcome lack of service

Title: Great camera!
Content:
I recently bought the Nikon D40 because I wanted to upgrade from my point and shoot camera. I love it! The image quality is great, the menu is intuitive, it's easy to carry around and not too heavy, and I am having a blast with the manual setting. I definitely recommend this camera for new photographers.

Title: Poorly Designed and Cheaply Made
Content:
I bought this and returned it immediately. The design is terrible and very hard to manage. The coffee grounds spilled over every time I made coffee. The cone filter is held in by a tiny speck of plastic which I am sure will break. This is cheap and not worth the money.

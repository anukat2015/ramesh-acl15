Title: Wow!  Never, never buy a point and shoot again...
Content:
Fanboy:
I know the price is more then a point and shoot - but you get what you pay for. Having owned a digital camera since 1999, and those all bring little point and shoot clicker - I have accumulated around 7000 digital pictures before I bought this camera in Nov 09. I now have around 10000! In 3 months I have almost taken half the amount that I took in 9 years!
Good:
The image quality is outstanding. The camera body is hefty enough to feel strong buy not to heavy to use for long periods of time. Built in flash works like a champ. Battery lasts FOREVER - I think we charge weekly and shoot pictures almost everyday!
Bad(If you could call it that):
Lens is a built to "multitasking" - Does a bunch of things good - Not 1 thing great.
Steep - steep learning curve if you want to learn and use every feature.
Camera sometime freezes causing a battery removal. This happens few and far between.
I couldn't recommend this more.

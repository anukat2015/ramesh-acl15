Title: Can't beat the price.
Content:
Works better on hardwood than carpet.  I bought this as a basement-only workbench vacuum cleaner.  It doesn't come close to my electrolux.  But, that's to be expected - my electrolux costs 5 times more.  This is an excellent choice for a secondary vacuum.  Cheap, compact, comes with many attachments.  The 'bag full' indicator is handy.

Title: Not for deep pile carpets or dog hair
Content:
When I received this, I was hesitant. Not only because of the small size, but the smaller container for debris. I was correct. I have deep pile carpet in my living room. I tried it in the living room. After 5 minutes, I had to empty it. Not even 1/8th of the floor was done. I have 2 German Shepherds, a breed that sheds very heavily, all year long. This item isn't made for stength. It's made for people who have very low pile carpets or bare floors, with pets that don't shed. I returned this. It isn't worth the price.

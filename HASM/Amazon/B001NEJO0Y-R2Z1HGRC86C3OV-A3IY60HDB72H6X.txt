Title: not so good
Content:
I am very disappointed with this laptop.  After only two months of having and using very little, while downloading the Norton 360 online (the 60 day version that came with the computer had expired), the computer crashed!  I have to say however, that I had a good experience with TOSHIBA.  TOSHIBA was very professional and quick to replace the hard drive, but I feel like I have purchased a lemon and treat this computer very tenderly.  I doubt that it will last as long as my Dell desk top - 10 years and still going.  I'll think twice before buying another PC and may just invest and upgrade to a MAC next time.

Title: Wow, honestly the best overall mp3 player on the market!
Content:
I have to say this second generation Zune is amazing, and with the new firmware update it fixes any small bugs there were that knocked some of the lower review scores you see in here.  
The new Zune is great, it's 80gb, and is has a much better screen in Size, and quality "Glass", over the 80gb Ipizzy classic.  The screen, wireless connection/sharing, premium headphones included, etc. trump the 80gb Ipod easily.  Until apple makes an 80gb touch, this Zune in my opinion the best buy anyone can make in looking for a high quality performer, with a ton of space to work with!

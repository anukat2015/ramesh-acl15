Title: efficient & effective cleaner
Content:
This Hoover has changed my life.  Since I can vacuum my bedroom and the rest of the house with an efficient vacuum and pick up pollen,dust mites, mold spores, cat hairs, dog hairs, and clean the rugs thoroughly, I have had no migraines.  There are two defects--both minor: the hose does not swivel and the rug attachment is too heavy and does not work on anything but carpet.  I wouldn't recommend it for handmade rugs such as orientals.  The stairs attachment is not worth much, so we don't use it, using instead the brush intended for bare floors. The container for collecting the dirt is easily cleaned, as is the heppa filter.  I didn't realize much dirt is in just one room.

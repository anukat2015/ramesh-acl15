Title: Zune 30
Content:
Love the look. Easy to use software. Battery life doesn't last at all if you are watching videos. Can't buy movies at their website. Zune to Zune sent songs only stay on your Zune for (3) days.
Still work needs to be done. I hope that the next gen. corrects some of these issues. Zune could be the best on the market if Microsoft choose to fix these problems.

Title: Easy to Use***BUT ONLY IF YOU READ THE BOOK****
Content:
This thermostat was a really good investment for the $40 price.
For starters, it was RIDICULOUSLY EASY to install.  I'm just your average Jane, and I was able to install this thermostat simply by following the instructions in the manual.  Installation was a no-brainer.
I haven't had the thermostat long enough yet to be able to say whether it's saving me money on heating bills, but I appreciate the control this thermostat gives me.  I was able to program the thermostat so that the heat is on a lower setting at night when I'm sleeping and at times when I'm not home during the day.  You can actually make a unique program for every day of the week if you want to.
Programming the thermostat was really easy, by the way.  Just like installation, all you have to do is read the manual and follow the simple instructions.
***The key here is that you must actually read the instruction booklet for this product.  My husband didn't read it, and he finds the thermostat confusing.  DUH.  I suspect that other people who have posted reviews saying that this thermostat is confusing have also not read the book.  You gotta take 10 minutes and READ THE BOOKLET, FOLKS.***
The only gripe I have about this thermostat is the same one that others have reported in these Amazon reviews:  The thermostat backlight is really annoying.  I wish I had the ability to turn it off and on with a switch.
(Others have also written that the batteries fall out of the thermostat when you open the cover.  I have not had this problem.)
Overall this product was a really great value.

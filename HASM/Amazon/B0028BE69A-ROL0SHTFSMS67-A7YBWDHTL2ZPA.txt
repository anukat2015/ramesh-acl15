Title: Just as good as the expensive name brands!
Content:
I recently changed colors in my kitchen from red to blue & looked for months for small kitchen electrics in blue. After many tries I chanced upon the Miallegro products and, because they were so inexpensive I decided to give them a try. I purchased 3 products, the stand/hand mixer, the blender & the coffee maker. All three products perform as well or better than the expensive name brands I have used for years...Cuisinart, Kitchen Aid, etc. The mixer can be used as a stand mixer or just pop off the top & use it as a hand mixer. The bowl is a little smaller than other brands, but I have some older mixer bowls that will fit if I need larger. The blender container is much larger than other brands which is nice for making larger batches of drinks & it crushes ice great! It's a little loud, but takes much less time than others I have had, especially if you're using a lot of ice. The coffee maker makes a full 12 cups & has a permanent filter which is so much nicer than using paper filters, and the coffee tastes great. It doesn't have a clock or a programmable feature but I don't need those, so it's not a problem for me.
All in all, I am very pleased with my purchases...by buying 3 at the same time I saved a lot on shipping charges...the total for all three items, including shipping, was under $130! You can't even buy 1 of the big name brands for that. And they're really cute, too, and look great on my kitchen counter!

Title: Got a defective unit
Content:
I had high hopes for this player, but there were some major defects in the unit I received, enough to return the item to Amazon. 
- After loading it with some songs, any subsequent plugging into my computer would only show some, not all, of the files I knew were in there. Eventually, I found that I had to copy another file into the player in order to make the "hidden" files appear. 
- Trying to put a large file or files (~400MB or so) into the player caused an error window to pop up. I tend to listen to podcasts in batches on the weekends or want to replace a big chunk of music all at once, so having to drag the files over in parts was also annoying. 
Smaller problems: 
- Font type is some kind of long, skinny serif. Doesn't match the nicer font in the listing image. 
- There are, if I remember correctly, seven LED backlight colors, but ONLY the blue is attractive and allows the LED font to be most clearly legible. The rest of the colors (red, green, orange and some others) make the text hard to read. 
- Build quality is not particularly good. The plastic itself seems sturdy, but shell and covers are somewhat ill-fitting. 
- Sound quality is simply okay, nothing more. 
This player has 2GB flash memory, but no FM radio or microphone, so overall, the current price (~$30) represents fair but not spectacular value--if you have a properly working unit.

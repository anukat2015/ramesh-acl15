Title: Excellent General Purpose Laptop
Content:
I have used this laptop for about a month and I am very happy with it.  It works great for web surfing, email, word processing, watching movies and streaming video.  It also works well with my wireless N home network.  The Turion II Ultra processor is very capable and the Radeon graphics are the best integrated graphics you will find.  It will play Direct X 9 games like Halo at full resolution without a hitch.  The speakers sound better than I expected and the laptop looks like a more expensive machine.  If you do heavy video editing or other graphics intensive activities, you need a machine with a separate graphics card and the latest high end processor, but the vast majority of users would be very satisfied with the performance of this Gateway.  It is a real bargain at $530.

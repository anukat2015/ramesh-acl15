Title: Step up for amateur photographers
Content:
I have used a small digital for years, basically for the ease and quality of the photos I get.  I gave my camera to my son who moved out of state with the intent of purchasing a similar model.  A friend purchased the Nikon and I was so impressed with the results.  However, it has taken a long time for me to figure out all the features; basically I need someone by my side to take time to explain all the options!

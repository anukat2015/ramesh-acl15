Title: it is the cheapist DSLR, but you have to know why
Content:
it is good camera,especially in this low price ($549 with two lens in fry's). I don't want to mention good points because a lot of people already did. I just want to point out big problem for this camera because it looks like nobody mentioned yet. The big problem is auto focus in very low light( I mean very low light),the camera has no response or lens zoom in and out, just refuse to fire. I tried many times. Probablly the reason is that camera couldn't see any subject although alluminating assist light kept flashing. I tried it in day time, too. I just point camera to sky(blue sky without clouds), the camera had same problem ( could not focus and refuse to fire). In above satuations I had to change to MF or turn on release prority, but picture came out with out of focus. This is very annoying and never happend to other camera,even very cheap point and shot camera. I could not figure out why, probably this camera only has 3 point auto focus compare with canon has 9 points. olympus e500 has the same problem. I heard olympus e3 has 11 points auto focus. I don't know if it has the same problem. If you want to buy this camera, you have to know this problem. If you can tolerate this, you can buy it. it is the cheapist DSLR with high qulity in the market.

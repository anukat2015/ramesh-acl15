Title: Nikon D80 Digital SLR
Content:
This camera is excellent. It's easy to use and allows you to do some fairly impressive and more advanced things in photography. I upgraded to this camera and the clarity in each picture is startling. I can't wait to enlarge my photos to poster size. As you might imagine, I highly recommend this camera to most anyone who wants to do more that point and click even though you can do that quite well with this camera.

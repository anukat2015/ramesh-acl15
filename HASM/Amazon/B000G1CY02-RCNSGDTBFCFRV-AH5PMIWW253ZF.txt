Title: Just what I was looking for!
Content:
I bought this heater to supplement my electric furnace at times when I just wanted to heat a single room and not the whole house.  It's served remarkably well in this application.  It's almost noiseless (I hate fans because of their noise)and heats an isolated area really well with just an occasional click as it comes on and off----It would also serve well as a supplemental heater during very cold weather-------HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

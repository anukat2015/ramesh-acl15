Title: This is not the Farberware you mother bragged about
Content:
To be honest, I do not own this specific model.  My review is about what looked like and was sold as the exact same pot a few years ago.  Correction, the three pots I bought a few years ago.
When three pots failed (coffee not hot, electic sparks, heating element went) I did a little research.  I do not have all the detail handy anymore, but I remember, the origial Farberware company was a privately held company located in the Bronx, NY.  The original owners chose to sell the company instead of giving in to the landlord; do not believe it was a product or employee issue.
I believe licensing / ownership of the brand name changed a number of times.  Today it is owned by Lifetime Brands, Inc., and the Meyer Co. holds the license to market products under the Farberware brand name.  I think I got all this right; who owns and who licenses the right to market products under a brand name gets complicated.  
Serve it to say, the Farberware brand our mothers knew and loved is not the brand you see on the shelves today.  It's a darn shame.  That pot made the best cup of cofee you could get, and it was HOT!    
P.S.  I purchased and had to replace/ eventually return the Presto Percolator I purchased at WalMart as well.  I no longer trust electronics sold by WalMart as I do not believe they meet the same spes as a similar looking models sold in department stores.  I might be wrong, but too many returns to trust further.
An interesting read:  Go here for some history on ownership of the Farberware brand-name:

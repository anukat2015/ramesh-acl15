Title: I'm taking mine back and getting an older model
Content:
I decided to purchase an iPod because I already have a 2nd generation 2GB nano, and figured I already had the accessories I needed to play it.  I was not happy to find out I was wrong!  I can't play or charge it in my car, and the players I have at my office will play music but not recharge.  The speaker inside the 5th generation is nice - not quality wise, but just a nice thought - I don't know how many times I've accidentally left my 2nd gen on and had the battery run out (but then again the player I use it with charges as it plays so it's never been a huge deal).  Anyway the speakers aren't the best quality, and seeing as I can plug my 2nd gen into old computer speakers so I can listen to podcasts at home, I figured I'd just do that.  Nope.  Can't do that with the 5th gen.  I also don't understand why it takes video but not still shots, and the lens is in the most awkward place.  Plus I couldn't find in the instructions how to stop recording (you push the menu button).  Sure, there's cool features, the FM radio with a pause feature (which I never bothered to use), the pedometer (which I never bothered to use), a voice recorder (does a pretty good job), and a sleep timer (I'm not sure if other generations have this feature), but ultimately, it's too high maintenance to keep it, and I'm not going to buy updated equipment for it.  So I'll either look into a refurbished older model or another mp3 player altogether - whatever will work best with the accessories I already have.

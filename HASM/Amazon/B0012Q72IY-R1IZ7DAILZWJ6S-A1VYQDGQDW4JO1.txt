Title: new DSLR for HDR photography
Content:
This is my first digital SLR. I have been using point and shoot digitals for the past few years.I have wanted to get into High Resolution Photography since I saw an article in Popular Science last year. I have been pleased with the quality and capabilites of the K200D. I almost got a Pentax K10 last year, and I am glad I waited, because the K200D has most of the same features as the K10 did. And at a less expensive price. The functions of the K200D took me about 2 days to figure out. And I am getting great photos. I checked out the other DSLR cameras and liked the Pentax the best value. Also be careful about where you get your camera. I have found a more than a few internet camera dealers out there with low prices that when I googled their business it was a scam. I have been very satisfied with Amazon,s pricing on this camera[..]

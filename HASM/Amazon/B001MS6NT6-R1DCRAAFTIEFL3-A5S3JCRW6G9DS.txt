Title: Disappointed.....
Content:
I opened the box, turned it on and was immediately instructed to create system recovery discs.  I was a little surprised that the recovery discs were not included on a premium, $800+ laptop.  The first recovery disc failed about 1/3 of the way into recording.
When I tried a second time, the clickable link to create recovery discs was no longer clickable/working.  The computer would not let me create a recovery disc no matter what I did (even bypassing the Vista/Sony link).
So, I boxed it up and returned it.  A computer just doesn't get better from here.
I have no confidence in the unit I received and, frankly, after seeing the other reviewers comments, my confidence is a little shakey for this model in general.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do as I really need a laptop.  By the time I ordered this unit and recieved it and, now, send it back and get credited, I will have lost two to three weeks.  I guess these things happen... but it's a pretty frustrating experience nonetheless....

Title: Look great, great features, maybe the new standard to beat
Content:
I love this player. You can connect directly from the player to your TV or through your Xbox 360. It is so easy to use. The software is creating some problems for the power users but I don't think most people will notice a problem. I also believe they will come out with some updates within the next couple of weeks to solve these problems. Everything else works very well. I really think that this is going to be the player to beat.

Title: Heats well and distributes it evenly
Content:
Pros:
- Works really well in heating up our living room quickly and quietly. (We tried the Holmes quartz tower heater (HQH307) but that only heated the air right in front of the machine and was super loud.)
- Housing stays cool.
Cons:
- I have small hands (about 6" long), but the indentation in the back where you are supposed to hold the top is even hard for me to insert my fingers into. Granted, you are also supposed to use your other hand to hold onto the other side at the base, but I would prefer a deeper top handle. I also encountered the same issue with the Holmes.
- The remote is small, symmetrical and not ergonomic.  Just by feel, it's not easy to tell which end you're pointing at the heater.
- Each time you adjust the heater (manually or by remote), it makes a really loud beeping noise which scares our pets.
Update: 
- I have to agree with the other reviewers that the blue LCD display is too bright. It emits a bright, large swathe of light. I didn't think this would be an issue, but the amount emitted is really impressive.
- Also, I set the timer to go off during the night and the beep was so loud that it woke me up. I really wish we could adjust the volume.
- The second time we turned it on, the heater started turning the timer setting on and off by itself as if a poltergeist had taken possession of it, all the while beeping repetitively. We unplugged the heater and plugged it back in. It did it again. After the 4th or 5th try, the heater finally settled down and we haven't had the problem again. I'm not sure what caused this.
- It still heats great.

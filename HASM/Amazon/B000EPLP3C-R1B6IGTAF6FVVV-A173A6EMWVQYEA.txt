Title: They still sell this one?
Content:
HAHA I can't believe amazon is selling this 30Gb zune for $239.00  It was the first model to come out, I've had one for three years now and it still works no problem.  But I picked one up for someone, brand new with accessories for $99.00 at a place that has Buy in the name.  Seriously, Amazon is selling the 120Gb zune touch for $209.00   haha

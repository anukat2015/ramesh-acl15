Title: Light and compact but powerful.
Content:
This little vacuum is light and maneuverable. It makes vacuuming a two-story home including stairs a comparatively easy job, and I'm a senior citizen. This vacuum may have been designed for a smaller space than ours as the cord doesn't quite reach as far as I would like and it has a tendency to warm up, but I would prefer to vacuum the whole house without stopping to move the plug to another outlet. Although someone mentioned that it is too loud, I don't think it is bad. Having tried quieter vacuums, the price tag is way more than what I would be willing to pay for something a bit quieter. I'm very happy with my purchase, with it's power and ease of changing from hard surface to carpet mode, and it is a joy to use.

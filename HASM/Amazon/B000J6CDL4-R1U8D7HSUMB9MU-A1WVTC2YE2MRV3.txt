Title: Leica Digilux3 review
Content:
Recently purchased my first Leica. As I am a great Nikon fan, this is quite a change, but this time I wanted something different.
The Leica deliver excellence. It is easy to use, and deliver fantastic picture quality right out of the box. As I'm used to manual photography, I also like the "oldfashioned" but very effecient way of using the Leica just as an old SLR. A bit pricy, but the kit lens is probably the best normal zoom you can get anywhere.

Title: It makes great coffee
Content:
I bought this as a gift for my partner who has rather particular tastes in coffee.  Her opinion is that it makes great coffee and she is very happy with it.  It was easy to set up.  It keeps the coffee hot for quite some time and keeps it warm after that.  One "green" benefit is that because it is a thermal carafe, it uses less engery than coffee makers that use a hot plate to keep coffee warm.  You also don't risk burning the coffee or a small person's hand that might reach up on the counter.  All in all, she is very happy.

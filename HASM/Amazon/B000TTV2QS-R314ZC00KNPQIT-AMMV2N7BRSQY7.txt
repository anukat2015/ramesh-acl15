Title: Great Heater
Content:
We use this heater in our 2 bedroom apartment. It does a great job of heating just the space in our apartment that we're using instead of using central heating. The remote is pretty useful for lazy bums like me. 
The only drawback (and it's minor, a matter of preference) is that if you use it in your bedroom at night it can dry out the air a little bit and leave you with a sore throat in the morning. This can be easily remedied by using the timer on the heater or a humidifier. 
Overall, great product. Completely satisfied with the purchase and would recommend to others.

Title: Sounds Great 50D
Content:
Thank you Jodi-Ann Richards, for such a detailed review on the Canon DSLR 50D. I am looking at buying a DSLR, and have my 'eye' on all the newest models. 
I have a Canon Film SLR Rebel Ti, and have read reviews for the Xsi and the new Rebel Ti1 and other DSLRs with Nikon and Canon. I have been very happy with Canons, and the 50D sounds treamedous and very clear image quality at 15.1 megapixels. I have a photography blog online, and have had photos published in magazines and calendars. I mostly take photos of landscapes, nature, travel, scenery, portrait, pets, etc. 
I have read many positive and a few negative reviews about the 50D, and it sounds tremendous. I have also researched the Canon 5D Mark II, but the price bracket seems very expensive. 
I have 2 Canon EF lens, a 90mm and a telephoto 300mm, and consider myself as a semi-professional photographer; by no means a beginner. Would the 50D be the 'best' choice? 
Although the price seems high, reading other reviews, it has been highly rated, and sounds fantastic. I also have a Canon power-shot A650 and that takes clear photos, and I like that for "get up and go", however am looking at replacing my film SLR. Do you know of any photography stores in Canada, who offer a trade up-upgrade?

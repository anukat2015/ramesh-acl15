Title: Great on pet hair
Content:
I love this vacuum. I have 2 large german shepherds that shed a LOT!
This vacuum does a great job getting all of the hair. The attachments help a lot.
I used the small beater bar attachment and it got all of the hair out of the sofa.
It does great on hardwood floors, the carpet and stairs. 
I would have given it 5 stars but I have 2 minor complaints.....
1) the cord should be longer
2) the main beater bar head takes major force to stay clicked onto the telescoping wand.
I have to really shove it in hard or it pops off.
Other than those 2 things.....this is an awesome vacuum.

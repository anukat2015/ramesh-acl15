Title: Pretty, but not enough output for larger rooms.
Content:
From reading the reviews I thought the heater would be able to handle my 15'x18' living room (8' ceilings; not exactly huge), but it has no effect. I left it on all of yesterday and last night on max and the room is still 63. It is hot to the touch and I like warming my hands over the hot air emanating from the slots on the top, but I guess it's not meant for larger rooms. It is also very attractive, so I'm sorry to have to return it. It would be nice if the product descriptions could show what size rooms these heaters are intended for.

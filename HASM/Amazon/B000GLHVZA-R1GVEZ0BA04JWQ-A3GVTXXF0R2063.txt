Title: USA made vortex heat
Content:
After dealing with cheap chinese made often unsafe heaters from big box stores, I selected this Vornado heater due to its features and the fact it is made in USA.
I find it heats very well and I like the idea that it will only run at a high enough level to maintain set temp. The dial selector is much easier to understand and use than the digital setup.
The fan is quiet on low, it bit louder on high. I notice the grill on this unit is tighter than on my ATVH unit and airflow seems a bit slower.
Due to the fact the element does not glow red, this heater should last a good long time. It is cool to touch, even at full blast.
For those who insist this unit heat their entire home, be advised it will comfortably heat a 245 sq ft area.  I can run this unit in my living room of my townhouse down to about 19 deg outside and it will maintain 70 degrees temp.

Title: Great for the price
Content:
Was tired of spending 10.00 a day on Iced Lattes so I got this machine at Target as it was easiest and no shipping involved. It works fine for my home use, now when I make cannollis I can offer the espresso and cappucino to complete the meal. I am no longer a regualr a the Dunkin Donuts drive up for that large Carmel thinny Latte adn am very happy.....I love my capps but I am not a snob, I buy my beans at Starbucks or DD's and grind them when I need and voila it is great

Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
I bought one of these for my son for Christmas and had a terrible experience with it.  I opted for this one because I thought the battery was a better option for a kid than recharging.  Within 20 days about half the screen was unreadable and garbled.  I returned it for another one and that one too failed within 2 weeks when it became totally unresponsive.  No matter what I did it simply would not boot and play.  I finally just returned that one for a refund and bought him something different.  If you can find this for 30 bucks or something it might be fine as a backup that you won't cry about losing or breaking, but as a primary mp3 player there are many better choices.

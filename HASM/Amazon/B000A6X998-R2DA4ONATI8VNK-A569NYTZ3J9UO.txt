Title: Works as advertised.
Content:
This product works as advertised.  One thing I wish for is ability to shut off fan altogether to reduce noise level for music listening.  Another is a more sensitive thermostat that would cause unit to cycle more frequently so that it doesn't become so warm before shutting off.  The product I used before was a quartz heater without a fan that was made by Boekamp.  After many years of faithful service, this unit finally expired.  Having said that, the fan noise level for the Holmes unit is quite low.

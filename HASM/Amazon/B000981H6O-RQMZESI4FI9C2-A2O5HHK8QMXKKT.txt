Title: Perfect for parents of a toddler
Content:
I use this every day because I have a toddler who likes to drop pieces of food all over my house and car. I took it right out of the package and used it, it was already charged.It works very well. The suctioning power is great. It sucks up Cheerios, peas, spaghetti, my coffee grounds, leaves and misc crumbs. It doesnt have a light to show it is charging and it wasnt great at sucking sand off his car seat, and it won't fit those Gerber "puffs" inside the nozzle, but it is so powerful for everything else, that I will overlook those things. I use it on my boy's stroller and his high chair and they are spotless. It does everything I need it to do and I wish I got it sooner. Five stars.

Title: Best player on the market (October 2008)
Content:
The Good: Amazing sound quality, well built, good finger pad, dedicated volume buttons, screen quality, drag and drop file transfer, flash memory, decent headphones.
The Bad: Software interface is lacking compared to a Creative, proprietary USB connection, built in battery (I know most players have this know, but that doesn't make it OK), expensive, no microphone, no radio. 
Overall the player is amazing. I give it 4 stars (would give it 4.5 if I could) because of the above mentioned 'Bad' qualities, but IMO it still beats everything else on the market, even considering it's high cost. I had some one of the old Creative players and enjoyed the f.m. radio, built in microphone, removable battery, and amazing user interface. However Creative has gone down hill big time. I bought the Creative Zen, and sent it back after 1 week. 
The Sony is amazing. One problem I am having with it is that the sound quality is almost too good for some of the stereo's I plug in through auxiliary. With the EQ set to custom, and some of the other audio enhancers, I get some weird volume swells when listening to data rich stuff (heavy metal with lots of drums and distorted guitars etc.), but that could just be cheap speakers, because it's not on every stereo. It's easily fixed by flat-lining the EQ, and this still gives better sound than most anything else out there. 
Definitely worth the money if you have it.

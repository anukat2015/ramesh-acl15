Title: works fine, doesn't light-up
Content:
The thermostat was inexpensive and does the job as stated. There are four settings per day [presets]. The programming for weekdays and weekends are done separately. It has two overides: one for temporary bi-bass [from one preset to another] or a vacation overide [until you return home]. The only thing negative about the thermostat is that it doesn't light up for easier viewing in dim light or darkness.

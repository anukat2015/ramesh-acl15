Title: Perfect laptop for a Perfect price
Content:
As a small internet business owner, I needed a laptop that is portable and reliable.  I originally started looking at the 10" netbooks, but found them to be too small and I hated that they only ran the Windows 7 Starter version which has some major restrictions.  This 11.6" laptop has a decent size screen and a nice size keyboard.  I was deciding between this and the HP, but when you customize the HP to have all the same specs as this Acer, the cost was over $800 so this became a no-brainer.
I've had my Acer for about 1 month now and it is great. Windows 7 takes a little getting used to, but I've had no issues with it at all.  I hooked it up to a wireless network printer without incident and it wasn't loaded with a ton of garbage-ware.  My only issue was that it only comes with the student/home trial version of MS Office, and I am an Outlook user.  The entire office suite is expensive, so instead I tried Mozilla Thunderbird which is free and it works just as well as Outlook.  Once my trial period for the MS Office software is up, I will purchase it for only $149 and keep Thunderbird as my email client which will save me a pretty penny.
Amazon had this laptop out to me in 3 days with free shipping (HP charged $35 for shipping).
If you are looking for a "net-book" with all the capabilities of a regular sized laptop, I highly recommend this Acer.

Title: Amazon Suck.
Content:
I try to return the product a couple time online and talk to Amazon agent for an authorization number to send it back. They sey they will email me for the authorization number. It never came. It had passed the return date for me to retur. Amazon sell it but I want to return it, they look away. I will not buy product from Amazon again.

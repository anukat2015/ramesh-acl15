Title: Even better than the original 5d
Content:
I've had the original 5d for about two years.  Just bought the new 5d mark II and have used it for a couple of months now.  Wonderful camera, especially for narrow depth of field portraiture or low light work.  I've shot at ISO 1600 and the photos look great.  
I've also played around with the new video capture.  The video was excellent, but it really doesn't compare to a dedicated video camera.  
The menu's have changed a bit, and the battery is not compatible with the original 5d, so that's a bummer; had to buy new spares.  
Highly recommended.

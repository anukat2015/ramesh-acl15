Title: Moni Tower Honeywell Sourrond Heater
Content:
The 360 degree Surround Heaters work extremely well.  My only disappointment was that the older surround heater I own has a switch that allows for changing from surround to front heat only.  This adjustment switch was good because it allowed the consumer to determine where the heat was most needed.  The newer heaters do not have this switch.  Maybe Honeywell should reconsider that feature.  The heaters are cost effective and really last.

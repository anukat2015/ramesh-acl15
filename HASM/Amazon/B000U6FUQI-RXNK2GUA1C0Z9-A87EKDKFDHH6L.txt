Title: Love this stick vac!
Content:
There are so many mixed reviews of the Dirt Devil Kruz but I love it.  It flies across my wood floors practically by itself on the gliders.  It picked up the dust bunnies, needles from the Christmas tree, and various assorted dirt.  The dirt cup is a good size and easy to dump and clean.  This is the perfect vac for in between using my central vac.  I cleaned both my upstairs and down on one charge so I would say the battery life is more than adequate.  Very pleased!

Title: Very nice and clean....
Content:
This model is great....quiet ....nice looking...compact...and fast.   We also have the re-usable K-cup so we can use our own coffee....works great with that or the prefilled K-cups....I could only find this B70 model on Amazon in stock....none of the retail stores didn't have it online or in stock until after January...coffee is nice and hot and you can pick from 4 cup sizes....was going to give it to my husband for Christmas, but he saw the writing on the box (thanks Amazon) that said Keurig and he had to try it right away.  We've had MANY coffee makers....this is the best.

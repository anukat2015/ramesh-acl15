Title: Very Good Machine
Content:
This laptop turned out to a be very good buy.  This is the 2nd laptop I bought in the last few months.  One for my son and one for my daughter.  Both love the fact that it has a small form factor, light weight, and yet it is not so small as a netbook.
But as other reviewers have pointed out, the laptop feels slugish right out of the box, until the Aero is disabled and all the crapware uninstalled.

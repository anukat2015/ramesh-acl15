Title: Good, but could be better
Content:
After reading about the new faster processor and stable battery life of the 3rd Gen iPod Touch, I may have had high expectations.  It is SLIGHTLY faster, but still not as snappy as I would expect.  And the battey life is NOT all that great still.  Why does Apple keep the non-replaceable battery model?  Lastly, I really hate how Apple almost forces you to use their ear phones?  If you do NOT use their ear phones you have to push the "on" button, slide the unlock bar, and then push the pause button just to pause a song.  First off this wastes batteries and it takes a frantic moment to pause when someone comes by to talk.  If you use the Apple ear phones, it has a pause button.  Other than that it is still a very good mp3 player overall.

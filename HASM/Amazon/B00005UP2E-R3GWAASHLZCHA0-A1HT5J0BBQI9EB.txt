Title: Good for quick pick-ups on hardwood but messy to empty
Content:
If you want to use this vacuum on any type of carpeting, do not buy it. I do not use it on carpeting. It just doesn't work on my area rugs. I have two dogs and three active boys. It works well on the hardwood floors in the upstairs of my house, and I like that I can carry it on my shoulder with the strap and move around. However, my dogs spend the most time in the downstairs level of my home, and this vacuum can't handle all the hair. The head gets clogged and hair gets stuck all over it. I also find emptying the dirt cup a messy job and the dog hair just won't come right out because of static cling. I always empty it outside, which is a pain when it is really cold or there is snow. It is also very loud compared to other vacuums, both large and small, that I have owned over the years. 
Overall it is good for quick-pick ups on hardwood floors or tile. You will find it is a good vacuum for this purpose.

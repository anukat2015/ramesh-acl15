Title: Great alternative to normal netbook
Content:
I have had this for 3 weeks.  Did a lot of research, and actually saw this at BJ's at a slightly lower price.  But with sales tax, Amazon price was almost identical.  The only shortcoming to giving it 5 stars is the touchpad and buttons.  Many reviewers commented on this, and I have to concur, it is horrible.  But everything else is great.  Seems quite fast, and since it is running Vista, can't wait to see how it handles Win 7 next month.  Battery life is also quite good.  Works great for a day of notes and browsing.  Also small power supply.  And runs quite cool.  Overall, I love it.  
P.S.  I am overcoming the touchpad with a mouse, using a Bluetooth adapter IOGear USB 2.0 Bluetooth Micro Adapter GBU421 bought at Amazon and a Logitech Bluetooth mouse that I had bought for my previous laptop and it works great!  The adapter is barely visible, and is same color (blue)as my Acer.

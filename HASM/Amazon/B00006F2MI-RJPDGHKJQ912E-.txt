Title: Horrible...the WORST Coffeemaker EVER
Content:
Like everyone else, I was so excited to purchase this machine.  What a tremendous disappointment ... to have the weakest, most plastic-tasting coffee ever.  I hated everything about the machine.  The design is awful in that you can't see how much water you are putting in unless you shine a light down inside the chamber.  I won't address the cleaning/steam build-up issues, as everyone else has mentioned them.  Bottom line, I took the coffeemaker back after trying for one month to make it live up to its brand name.  I pulled my old faithful Braun out of storage, apologized to it, and am once again enjoying coffee (rather than lukewarm brown water).  What was Cuisinart thinking??

Title: Better than I expected
Content:
I wanted a powerful AC unit that could keep up with the computer equipment in my office. The 14,000 BTU handles that load well. It actually gets too cold in my office now for my comfort. It's a little noisy but I expected that in a unit this size. No more than you would expect from any portable AC unit.
A feature I am very happy about that wasn't listed in the description when I made the purchase was that it has a water line to drain the collected humidity right through the exhaust hose. Even better, it makes mist of the water so it evaporates almost instantly so it doesn't leave water lines outside of my window. I was trying to figure out how I was going to empty the water collector but that is not an issue with this unit. 
The silver look and the big blue backlit LED screen give it a look that fits in good with technology. The cold air comes out the top in a  vent that is adjustable enough to point air just about anywhere, from straight up to airflow that is parallel to the floor. 
I haven't needed the heat yet but it's nice to know it's there. The remote is fairly intuitive and also has a backlit screen which is nice.  Overall, I am very please with this AC unit and I'm glad I didn't try to save a hundred buck to go with some of the lower powered units. The water issue alone is worth a hundred bucks to me.

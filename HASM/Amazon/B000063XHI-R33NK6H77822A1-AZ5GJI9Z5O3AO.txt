Title: Disappointed
Content:
The carafe holds only 5 cups of water, not 10.  Condensation drips from the filter holder down the pot. I don't like black indicators on black backgrounds which the pot lid has.  I haven't brewed any coffee yet because the water level indicator has me puzzled.  When I poured 4 cups of water in to activiate the charcoal filter, the level indicator showed 7 cups. The steam and noise it makes is excessive.  I hope the coffe is as good as other reviewers have indicated to make me feel better about my purchase.

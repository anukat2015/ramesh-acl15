Title: small and cozy
Content:
works great for a small space-which is what I purchased it for. if kept on low setting, doesn't get too hot, important for bare legs, and is even more silent than our delonghi heater(which is better for a larger room). remember to move the dial past the "click" for it to start heating. I would only add a simple programmable time clock for future units. may purchase a separate timer for the outlet for this one.
simple, clean, and very functional. our cat is happy too, sniffs it each time, not avoiding it like larger heaters.

Title: Great, efficient heater
Content:
With the cost of natural gas way up last winter, I wanted to see if I could save money by using supplemental heating in some parts of the house.  I bought this one to use in my daughter's bedroom at night because I figured it was safer than a coil heater.
The Honeywell 690 has more than met my expectations.  It is odorless and silent (except a very quiet click when the thermostat goes on and off), easy to adjust and move around, and on its lowest setting (which I use exclusively), it is hot, but not too hot to touch.  I'm able to turn the house furnace down as low as I dare (to about 50...don't want to freeze my pipes) while my daughter stays nice and cozy in her bedroom.  And I really didn't notice any increase in my electric bill.  But while everyone I know was passing out over their gas bills, mine was quite reasonable all winter.
The nature of an oil-filled heater is that it takes time to heat a room, but then it does a fantastic job of keeping the temperature steady.  You don't have a super hot zone right next to the heater with it cold everywhere else.  In areas where we want quick, brief periods of heat (bathroom, kitchen table), I'm using fan-assisted coil heaters.  But in rooms where the occupants will be spending hours (bedrooms, family room, home office), the slow, steady heat of the Honeywell 690 is perfect.
I was so pleased with how well this performed last winter, I'm going to get one for my bedroom this winter.
Note:  If you buy one and it has anything beyond maybe a slight smell the first hour of usage, take it back for an exchange.  I'm very sensitive to odors, and I never smelled anything with this heater.

Title: Good device, but I watch videos so I wish I'd gotten an iPod Touch instead
Content:
I won't bore you with the standard technical details of the device, but I thought I'd share my experience: very pleasant. I bought this to use as entertainment during some extended plane trips I was going to use. I used it to watch approximately 6 hours of video (10 eps of a 25 min sitcom?) and an hour or two of music before the battery completely died on me.
Now that I've had it for a while, I would say that I kind of wish I'd bought an iPod Touch instead. I find myself watching way more video on it than I should (given the small screen) and missing the additional functionality the apps store brings to the iTouch. The physical size (while nice) doesn't really make a difference since I usually store it in a bag or in my car. The only thing that stopped me from buying the iPod Touch was price.
For the price, I think this device is hard to beat. It is quite capacious as well as really small and light. It syncs well and easily with iTunes. It came with minimal packaging.

Title: MacBook Pro
Content:
This is a great machine.... only had it for 4 weeks.. I have been a PC user since mid 80's... but was fed up with Microsoft software... blue screening... virus issues although none affected me personally... The machine has lived up to the advertising hype... and far beyond.  I bought the Applecare 3 year extended warranty with phone support... The price was right via Amazon at 27% discount.  I have taken a group lesson on getting started with the Mac... plus watched some of the many tutorials...  and ave now decided that I should have purchased the One on One support good for 1 year for $99.  Although you normally have to buy with the machine or within the two week return period... an Apple store manager waived the rule and allowed me to purchase 3+weeks.  Means you can schedule personal tech help 0ne hour at a time as often as you wish... so a worthwile investment if you are used to PC's as I was.
The speed of the machine is unbelievable... never ceases to amaze... and the screen legibility is second to none... Now wished I had purchased it earlier.

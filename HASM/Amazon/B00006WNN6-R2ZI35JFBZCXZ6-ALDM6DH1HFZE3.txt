Title: Cold office, warm hands
Content:
I love this heater. It's extremely quiet. It has to be, since it sits on my desk facing the left side of my keyboard, keeping my hands nice and warm. 
I work in an office that has polar temperatures in the summertime. Before I bought this heater, my hands would literally become numb from the cold. Now, soothing warm air flows over my hands, keeping them comfortable. And the gentle heat (it CAN get very warmm if you turn it up) also helps to keep the aches and pains, of typing all day, at bay.
Heartily reccommended. Not for large space areas, but it works wonders on my desk!

Title: Love This Camera
Content:
My daughter and I purchased this camera together and we love it.  We took it on vacation the week after we received it and the pictures turned out fabulous.  Neither one of us have either had a camera that would take a decent photo at night, but this one is the exception.  The photos at night were just perfect.  We only used the camera on auto because we didn't know how to use all the settings yet, but the photos turned out amazing.  If you're looking to purchase your first SLR digital camera, both of us highly recommend the Nikon D60!

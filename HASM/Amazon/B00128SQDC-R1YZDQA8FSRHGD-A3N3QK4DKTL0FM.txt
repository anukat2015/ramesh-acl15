Title: An EXCELLENT SLR Camera
Content:
This camera TIED with the Canon 30D both having a 74 Score with Consumer Reports July 2007 Issue, which stated on the front of the magazine.  "Finding the Best Digital Camera"  THEY EVEN SHOWED THE NIKON D80 camera on the Front of the Magazine!!!  I find this Camera and especially the Nikon Lenses quality to both be extremely EXCELLENT.  You can't go wrong with buying this Nikon D80 DSL Camera,  This Camera even OUTPERFORMED (according to consumer reports) the HIGHER PRICED Nikon D200!  This is one FANTASTIC CAMERA!  As for Lenses, I know that Nikon offers a package with THIS D80 Camera along with an 18-135mm Lens. (An EXCELLENT LENS)  The only other lens in this same categeory of Lenses would be the Nikon 18-200 which is priced at OVER $800, if you can afford to just buy the D80 body and can afford the $800 for the 18-200mm Lens I would highly recommend it, otherwise the 18-135 Nikon Lens IS an EXCELLENT substitute, Nikon also has a NEW Lens out the 55-200mm Zoom Lens  It retails for ONLY $218 on Amazon and is a worthy investment.  I am just getting into photography but am a quick study and one thing I will tell anyone is this:  Do NOT substitute a lesser quality lens which may list the SAME Nikon Lens Spec's such as: SIGMA, Tammaron, and a few others who make the same type of lens Nikon makes but NOT WITH THE quality and dedication to EXCELLENCE that Nikon Lenses offer.  You may save money in the short term by going with one of these COPY LENSES as I call them, but you will regret your choice when you see the lower picture quality, especially if you are able to compare the picture with one taken using a true NIKON Lens.

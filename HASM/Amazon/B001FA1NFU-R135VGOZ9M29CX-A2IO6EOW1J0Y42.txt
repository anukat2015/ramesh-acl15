Title: It's ok to ditch Windows Media Player
Content:
I was hesitant for a long time before buying my orange ipod nano.  I have a PC and have previously used mp3 players that were compatible with Windows Media Player.  I have had two 4GB Phillips Go Gear players and one Phillips Micro Jukebox.
I was worried that an ipod wouldn't play well with my system and that it would beat my music files around.  I was also afraid that I had to buy everything from iTunes.  None of this is true.  iTunes works great with my PC and I can still buy music from Amazon.com.  It loads right to iTunes.
All this has been based on the superiority of iTunes over Windows Media Player (which often crashes).  Besides the fact that I like iTunes better, I also love this little iPod.
Could Apple make the 8GB nano smaller?  Yes, but please don't!  This thing is so tiny and I'm afraid I'll drop it.  I put it in the fifth pocket when I wear Levi's.  It is well built out of aluminum and glass, I think.  (I'm sure about the aluminum but not positive about the glass).  It has a solid feel for such a little thing and very little plastic.
Every human being should be issued an iPod.  If this thing holds up well for at least a few years, I will definitely buy another.  It is customizable, there are a zillion aftermarket accessories made for the iPod and it will blow your ears out if you aren't careful.  It has a setting to limit the max volume.  It has a setting for everything.  I can turn cover flow on or off, shake-shuffle on/off, and I can sync with iTunes automatically or I can sync manually to set things up just how I want.  Battery life is also very good and the controls are very intuitive. 
You don't need to stress this one.  Buy the iPod, you'll love it.

Title: love it
Content:
This heater is one of their best. We live in an old house with high ceilings. This heats of the whole room in no time. The burn off smell was not as bad as previous owned oil filled heaters. This was a big plus as well. Be sure to follow the instructions. If you are not using the timer make sure you turn the unit off and unplug it .To avoid burning out the timer mechanism which will cause the unit to fail.

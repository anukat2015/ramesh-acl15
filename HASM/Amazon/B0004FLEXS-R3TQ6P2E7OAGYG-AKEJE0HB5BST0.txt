Title: The Best of the Inexpensive Coffeemakers
Content:
I drink lots of coffee in lots of places.  I've had the terrible plasticky coffee from the $10 drippers and very fine pressed coffee from the shops.
This is my third Black & Decker (more on that later) and continues to benefit from design upgrades and improvements.  I found this dripper to be the top of the line inexpensive coffeemaker.  Mine came with the resusable filter, but I find that using the disposable filters (for me) makes a slightly stronger and better coffee.
The program feature was a little counter-intuitive for me, but only took 30 seconds once informed to master.  Wake up to my coffeemaker's aroma.  Warning: The first time I tried to make coffee, the carafe didn't push the sticking, new drip basket arm in and I had a little overflow.  Apparently, it was because the machine was new and it now works flawlessly.  But you might want to make sure it drips properly the first time or two you use it.
I mentioned earlier that this is my third machine from this family.  It's not Black & Decker's fault that I live in an area with extremely hard, unprocessed well water.  All water processing appliances (like my water heater) get clogged up with time, even with proper maintenance.  These machines have lasted better than the old, bottom line machines I started out with, and longer than a more expensive one I bought.

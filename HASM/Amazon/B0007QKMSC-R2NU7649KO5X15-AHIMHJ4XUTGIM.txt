Title: Buy and never look back!
Content:
This is a short review to let you know what you need to know about this camera: "buy it, and never look back!"  Old photgraphers will tell you that top take good pictures, just take a lot of them and 1 in 50 will be great.  Unfortunatly that is expensive with film.  With digital, you can "throw away" for free any pictures you don't like.  But, digital can be sloooooow.  The Canon Rebel XT shoots three frames a second.  Do you know what it was like at Christmas this year to be firing away at all the crazy kids and not missing a single moment?  You know how you "see" a shot, and then a person moves before the digital camera catches it?  Not with my Rebel! It is on in 1/5 of a second and I can fire a picture in the remaining part of that second.. and then keep clicking away with its powerful flash keeping up to speed.  Sure, the price reflects all the myriad professional adjustments you can make to it.  You say you are just an amatuer and don't need 'em?  Put it in full auto and it sets up the shots for you!  I think its choices based on lighting and focusing were comparable (maybe even better than mine!)  YOU WILL GET GREAT SHOTS OUT OF THIS CAMERA.  Please, choke up the price, and you may never need another camera again.

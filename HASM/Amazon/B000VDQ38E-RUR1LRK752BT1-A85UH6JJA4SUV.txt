Title: Worth it's weight in gold!
Content:
I don't normally rate products unless I am truly in love with them.  Well in this case I'm head over heels!!!  Read all the reviews and did my research before I purchased the vacuum.  Let me tell you the reviews were right on the money.  The first time I swept my living room floor I had to empty the container 6 times....yes 6!!  My husband and I were amazed.  We have one small beagle and I was amazed at how much of his hair could acumulate in the carpet.  Every week I empty the container once after sweeping my living room.  I empty the container when the dirt is right below the edge of the "removable cup".  That way the dirt and soot does not overflow onto my carpet when I try to remove the cup from the unit.  First tires can be a little messy until you get the hang of the right way to remove the cup.  Dirt does accumulate around the basin.  But it's a small price to pay compared to the amount of hair and dirt this unit gets out of my carpet!!!  Truly the best vacuum around!!!!

Title: Made in China
Content:
I own a Mr. Heater portable Buddy heater and it works very well. I wanted to buy another but when I turned around I saw it was made in China. I would never trust a product made in China which has a flame in my home. Also with my experiences with Chinese products it would be a waste of money. It would probably brake down just after the warranty ran out and they would expect you to go right out and buy another. I'll just save my money it's just not worth it. I hope they never sell another for ruining a good product.

Title: Simply Wonderful!
Content:
This is a fabulous product! Instead of heating up an entire pot of water in a slow coffee pot, you just heat up one cup at a time at amazingly fast speeds! It's less than 30 seconds from the time you pour the water in until it's in your cup super hot. Put the amount of water you want in your cup or mug, then pour that into the Hot Shot and press the heat button. Put your cup under the spot and when the light goes off your water is ready and press the dispense button to fill up your mug.  It couldn't be simpler.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is a hot tea drinker, cocoa drinker, instant oatmeal eater, cup-o-soup eater, etc. - anyone who needs super hot water super fast!

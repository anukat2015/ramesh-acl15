Title: Miele Pisces S5281 Canister Vacuum
Content:
I bought this on Amazon from Mr. Vacuum and Ms. Sew to replace my Hoover wind tunnel.  I have had two Hoover wind tunnels that have lasted an average of 3-4 years.  Before that I had a Eureka vacumn cleaner.
I bought this vacuum based on the review of others and the expected life of this vacuum cleaner.  I haven't had much opportunity to use the vacuum so far, but I noticed a big plus is the noise level is much quieter than any of my previous vacuum cleaners.  The wand can be adjusted which is a great plus.  My husband made the comment that after I am done cleaning the house the air does not smell like dust.  I also like the different levels to set the suction power and the retractable cord.
I will update this rating as I use the various features.

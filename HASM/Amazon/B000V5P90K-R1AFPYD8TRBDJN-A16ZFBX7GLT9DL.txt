Title: Minor upgrade to 20D = Perfect
Content:
I upgraded from a 20D that got stolen.  Small improvements on a product I found to be perfect.  Most noticeable after 1,200 frames:  (had 30,000 on the 20D) 
- Body and grip larger (not bad at all).
- Larger LCD so much easier to see for review.
- LCD viewing angle so much better for showing pics.
- Live View handy for arms-over-head shots.  
Anyone else have problems with bright blue spots (noise) all over black/dark areas of low-light shots, in Lightroom?  I'm sure it's a post-processing issue, but I never had it with the 20D.

Title: Hard floor overkill???
Content:
I bought this vacuum for hard floors only. It may have been overkill. This is not a lightweight vacuum and after long use my arm does get a bit tired. I have a lot of tile and this does a good job. Unless you have a lot of hard floors or want this vacuum for all your flooring (carpeting etc) then this might be overkill. I didn't realize that I would have to purchase additional filters which is an added expense I had not planned on.

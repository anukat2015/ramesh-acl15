Title: I'm in love
Content:
I just bought a new Apple MacBook Pro. I work with macs all of the time because I am a graphic designer so I decided to go from my HP PC to an Apple computer. I love Apple computers because they are so much simpler to work with and tend to be better for creating graphics and so forth. I have fallen in love with my new computer. 
I do have two complaints. The first one is the price, although you get what you pay for. The second one is the battery charge. It is just average. It last about three hours but I know some laptop batteries that last five hours. After paying that much money for this product you would think it would last a little longer. Personally  I would say if you are not in the graphics field career wise I would not recommend a MacBook Pro. A MacBook would probably be better for you if you wanted an Apple. If your are in the graphics field I recommend the MacBook Pro.

Title: Happy I got Sony for a change
Content:
I have three Dells, one MacBook and one Acer.  I would say among them I liked Sony because of below
Pros: 
Good specs for a mid-grade notebook 
Comforable & quiet keyboard 
HDMI output 
Aesthetically pleasing 
Upward facing speakers 
nice finger tip mouse pad
crisp resolution
Cons: 
USB on right side I was using wired mouse and because of the USB connection and mouse it was very uncomfortable until I got the wireless mouse with tiny SB connection.
Fan comes on intermittently every 4-5 mins its noisy and gets pretty hot on the left side of the laptop.
Heavy (6.9 pounds) 
Low battery life (~2.5hrs on light usage) 
Modem connection: who uses it now?  could have used that space for something else like extra USB or firewire or for external SATA.

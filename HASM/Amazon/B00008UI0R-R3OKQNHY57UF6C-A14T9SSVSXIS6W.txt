Title: I can get under the bed without adding attachments
Content:
We had an upright vacuum which was the top-rated vacuum on consumer report. It worked well but it was cumbersome adding the attachments to get under the beds. I bought this vacuum and the first thing I did was to use it under the beds. When I switched from rug to floor function (with a mere push of a button) the vacuum would not pick up anything. I emailed Hoover and they said to check the metal extension. Sure enough, I had vacuumed up a kleenex which was under the bed. After that the vacuum worked like a charm. I am so glad I purchased it [We gave the upright to our daughter. She and her husband love it).

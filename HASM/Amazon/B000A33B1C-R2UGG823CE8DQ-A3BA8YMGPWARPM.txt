Title: Works great, but timer got REAL noisy
Content:
I thought giving it 2 stars was a little harsh, but it deserved it. 
The main issue is the timer that got really noisy once the heater is warmed up. Ironically, we bought this because of the timer feature. This just happened recently, with a little over a year on its clock (or 4 months usage last year, really).
The ticking is really, really loud. For a reference, we put it close to our feet next to our bed, so it's not next to our ears or anything. Even with the radio on (really soft), I can still hear the annoying ticks.
But, I have to praise it for its design that channels the heat up, so you can put it close to you w/o feeling burned. It's perfect to place close to our daughter's crib. 
I have to agree w/ another reviewer that says it's not very warm. I think it's more of that channeling design that makes it less effective in a more open room. This unit doesn't heat as effectively as our other conventional Delonghi in our living room, because it doesn't radiate the heat all around. So this unit seems best suited for close quarter w/o burning the people around it.
I'm still ticked over  the overly noisy ticking timer. I gotta find a way to disable it...

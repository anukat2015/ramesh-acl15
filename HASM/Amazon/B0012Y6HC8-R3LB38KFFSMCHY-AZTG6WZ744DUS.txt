Title: Good Camera
Content:
After a long research, I have selected this camera which stands half-way between Canon's Rebel XS and the latest T1i model. After all, 12 megapixels is optimal. Besides, many features  are quite rewarding for amateur. Unfortunately, I had to return this camera because, inlike many cameras I used before, I could not use that gorgeous 3" LCD display for shooting in the most popular fully authomatic mode (could be enabled in special modes only). Personally, I am not comfortable glueing myself into the tiny viewfinder, especially, when camera sits on a tripod and my forehead can easily touch or push the camera. Other than that, this is great design and workmanship.

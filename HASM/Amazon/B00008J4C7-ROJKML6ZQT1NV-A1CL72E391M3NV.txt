Title: Great Vacuum - Don't believe the bad reviews
Content:
It's sad to see that people who buy products don't read the manuals. If you had read the manual before using this vacuum you would have noted that it has three filters. The main filter is a HEPA filter that catches every particle that the vacuum sucks up. The other two are there to catch anything the HEPA didn't before blowing the air back out. It states in the manual that because of the filters the vacuum must be emptied out on a regualr basis. And also that the HEPA filter needs to be tapped out before being replacing in the vacuum - if you do this you will see how much dust it catches. It also says that you should wash out the HEPA filter after a heavy vacuum (I do it once a week). This will improve the suction power and the life of the filter (It took about a minute to clean). If however you are one of those people who doesn't read the instructions you will run into problems. The vacuum will overheat because the filter is jammed with so much dirt that air cannot pass through the motor to cool it off. It does have a safety feature that stops the machine before it burns out.  
  
 This vacuum is the best one I have ever owned. It is lightweight and has great suction power. It also comes with lots of attachments.  
  
 People need to learn to read manuals before using a product. Just because it's a vacuum doesn't mean you just plug it in and go. It was designed to capture all of the dirt, dust and whatever else you are vacuuming and not blow it back into the air.  
  
 READ PEOPLE! -It's a great little machine!

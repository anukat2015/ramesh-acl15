Title: Better tasting than the Pods
Content:
I alwasy wanted to try the k-cups, after having owned a pod machine for quite a while.  The k-cups are defintely better tasting.  The pods tend to go stale quickly, and the machine I own (Senseo) doesn't do a good job.  I've been very happy with the Keurig.  It appears to be high quality, and the coffee tastes great.  I really like that you can fill a tall travel mug.  My Senseo wouldn't let you do that.

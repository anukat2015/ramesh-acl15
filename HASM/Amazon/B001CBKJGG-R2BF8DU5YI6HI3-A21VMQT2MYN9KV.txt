Title: Very pleased
Content:
Well, I have only had this camera for a few days,but I am very happy with it. The price is very reasonable and affordable.This also is my first SLR having owned several point and shoot film and digital. The only "negative" about this camera is the "Live View". I see this as nothing more than a selling point aimed at point and shoot users. You cannot use the live view in full auto setting, you have to be in one of the manual settings. You cannot use the shutter button for auto focus (read the review on dpreviews.com), I don't want to go into a long explaination here. The view finder is very easy to see and use for taking pics so I probably wont be using live view except maybe to compose a tripod shot,take it out of live view and take the shot.The 18-55mm IS kit lens is really a very good lens and I have no complaints about it (well maybe the plastic mount). Focus is fast and the image stabilizer is great.The 18mm is a very good wide angle although the 55mm is not that great a zoom,I have the 28-135mm USM IS on the way and cain't wait to try it out.
 As I said I am very pleased with this camera and would recommend it to anyone wanting to make the jump from point and shoot to SLR's. 
Update 12/07/2008
After using this camera for a few weeks now I just wanted to add. I LOVE IT. I bought the 28-135 USM IS as a sorta replacement for the kit lens. I shoot mostly in the "P" mode with auto aperture,focus set on AI. 
I also shoot quite a bit of low light and I am amazed at the quality of the images (I do set the ISO on 1600 or 800)I intially gave this camera 4 stars only because of the live view which still is (in my opinon) not all that great.So I will now give it 4 1/2 stars

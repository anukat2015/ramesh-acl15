Title: excellent canister vacuum
Content:
good suctioning power, easy to maneuver and easy to assembly.
My Sears canister broke down after one year and to repair
would cost the same as purchasing this Hoover. THereby, I
switched. I am very happy with this one for now.. We shall
see how long this one will last.

Title: Should have learned the first time!!!
Content:
Okay, we have had 3 of these coffee makers because we love the grind and brew feature. The first one lasted about a year and a half, and the others well, we are a little under 6 months. I have to replace this one AGAIN because the flip top lid where you fill the water chamber and put the coffee beans in completely broke off, and I now have to hold the lid down until the pot is brewed. The last 2 we had, after a few months (and several deep cleanings I might add) would take almost and hour to brew a pot. My parents also used to have one, and theirs completely overflowed and spilled all over their counter and onto their hardwood floors!!!! I am buying the Capresso Luxe which is more expensive, but if it lasts longer, and it is easier to clean, then it is worth it. Please don't waste you money because this product WILL NOT last more than a year!

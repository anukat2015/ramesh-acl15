Title: Amazon Send without good packaging - Can't test
Content:
Well this item looked good except it was sent in a way that made a big dent right in the middle of the heater.  Returning it was a hassle since I had to stand in line at the post office with a 5 foot box. Then I find out they don't have anymore for a replacemnt in a message but they apparently do 3 days later since they are still selling them right now.
Good luck with your purchase. Would probably buy at local store since it does look nice without a dent.
Still waiting for my refund!

Title: Recommend 100%
Content:
Modes are easy to use.
Camera set-up is easy.
The screen is a good size.
The menu choices are good.
The weight is light.
The crispness of the images are incredible at the Largest file.
The download of images is easy from camera to computer.
Be sure to read about the camera and add software that is included with the camera, for this makes the camera easy to use and it offers so much more than I have written above.

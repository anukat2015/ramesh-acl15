Title: B&D DCM18S coffee maker
Content:
I like the personal coffe maker because of being fast and you can make just one cup at a time. The things i have found is that when you use fine ground coffee like Duncan Donut coffee, some of the grounds get into the cup.  I found that if you use regular grind coffee like Folgers Classic, that does not happen.  After washing in the dishwasher, the cup lid is loose and may come off.  I think that maybe if you use #1 coffee filter, it may help keep the grounds out of the cup  but they are impossible to fing where i live.  According to the price of full size coffee makers, the DCM18S, is a little over priced.

Title: nice player
Content:
i've had my H10 for about a month and i think it's a pretty nice mp3 player.  i downloaded the firmware update right away and haven't really had problems.  only one time it froze on me to the point that i had to remove the battery to restart it, however, that was after sitting plugged into my laptop idle for about 2 hours.  that's one of the reasons i didn't give it 5 stars.
some of the other things i don't like include the cheezy carrying case it comes with.  i had to buy different headphones because the earbuds didn't stay in my ears and they hurt, but that's probably just me.  one last thing -- windows media player is a pain to use!  although that's not entirely iRiver's fault.
overall, i would recommend this player because of all the features it comes with compared to ipods, like radio and photo capabilities.

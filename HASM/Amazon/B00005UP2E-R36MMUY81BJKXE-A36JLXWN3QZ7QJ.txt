Title: I LOVE this cannister vacuum cleaner!!
Content:
I recently purchased a Dirt Devil 082500 Breeze Bagless Canister Vacuum from Amazon!
I HAVE an upright cleaner, but it is very limited to the tasks of cleaning floors and carpets.
With my NEW vacuum, I just simply strap it across my shoulder and carry it with me as I clean walls, curtains, ceilings, inside all of my heat ducts, etc., etc...
My entire house feels really clean now!
I SHOULD have purchased one of these many years ago (as the dirt inside of the filter shows)!
I am extremely pleased with this product!!

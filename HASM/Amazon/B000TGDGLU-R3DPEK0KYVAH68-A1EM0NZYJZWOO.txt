Title: Great Heater, but too stinky...
Content:
I bought this heater last month to act as a supplemental heater for the living room and to heat a 12x15' bedroom at night.  I will start off by saying that the comfort temp setting works great.  The room heated up to a temperature that was cozy, but not too hot or too cold.  A good sleeping temp. 
One of the biggest problems I had with the heater was the lack of a thermostat.  I like to set the temperature in a room and leave and not worry that it will keep on heating past a certain temp.  The comfort temp control does this, however, as a supplemental heater, I found it annoying that I wasn't able to set it to a certain temperature.  My other heaters have digital thermostats (maybe I am spoiled by them?)
My greatest concern was with the oil smell the heater gave off.  I figured after a while it would go away, however, after a week of use it still filled the bedroom and the living room with the smell of oil, something like a diesel truck.  My wife said it gave her a headache, so we returned it.  I have read that this might have resulted from the unit being set on high heat, and while I had it set on the comfort temp at the highest setting, I think it isn't acceptable to smell on a normal setting.

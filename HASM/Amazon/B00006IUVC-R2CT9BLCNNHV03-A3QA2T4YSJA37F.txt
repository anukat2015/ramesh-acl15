Title: Can't Decant
Content:
Although the price on this item was fantastic after receiving it my husband and I were greatly dismayed to find that you cannot pour from the decanter without spilling the contents all over the counter top. You cannot pour water into the brewing receptical nor can you pour coffee into your cup without it spilling everywhere. We have had to resort to using the decanter from our old coffe maker on this machine. Either we received a lemon or the pour spout is poorly designed. Please pass out complaints along to the manufacturer.

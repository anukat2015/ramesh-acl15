Title: Bissell Healthy Home Vacuum - 5770
Content:
If you have pets... this is the vacuum for you. I researched vacuums before I purchased the Bissell Healthy Home Vacuum - 5770.  The hepa filter was a draw for me but I was really interested in the long hose (although is hard to stretch) and the brush attachment, which my husband says "those never work". What does he know? That attachment took all the cat hair off my sofa and pillows, huge bonus for me! The real test was my BLACK area rug where everything shows and it performed awesomely with only a pass or two, back to new. I did not rate it a 5 only because, like everyone is saying, it's heavy and not meant for everyone. I wouldn't recommend it to my Mom or my Grandma; they would really have a hard time pushing it around, I consider it a work out. The on and off switch does not bother me but I would have thought I blew a fuse if I didn't know about it being easy to turn off in advance. This vacuum is pretty quit, as far as vacuums go anyway. It glides smooth on floor surfaces and it doesn't hurt your trim if you bump up against it. I was really excited to get my new vacuum cleaner home and it was worth every penny. My carpet looks fresher just after vacuuming. To empty the container was a snap to remove and put back but just like any bagless vacuums it's always going to be a bit of a mess.  Over all, its power will raise the nap on your carpet, pull the cat hair off your sofa and suck the dust off your floors... just like a good sweeper should. You won't be disappointed. Just hope it lasts.

Title: A nice distraction
Content:
I have had this laptop for about two months and overall am happy with it.  I brought it for a trip out of the country and with the assistance of an external DVD drive was able to load about 9 full length movies and playback was flawless. I have noticed that the color display looks very washed out when going through my photo slideshow which I have set as my desktop background.  I find myself moving the screen back and forth because the colors looked very dull and unlike the true photo when viewed on other machines.  Still getting used to the multi-touch pad and have to say as of now I do not like it very much.  I inadvertently zoom when I'm trying to scroll and so on and so on. I am not that impressed with the battery life as I am averaging about 4 hours or so on a full charge.  Not as much as I would like....but it is bearable.  I have had a few blips with the OS where my profile would not load and had to do a couple of reboots but outside of that no problems with speed, performance, or audio.  The price was not bad at all...not the cheapest but definitely not the most expensive in its class.  Also, I would be remiss if I did not echo what I am sure is the sentiment of other owners of this laptop...it is a major fingerprint magnet, so carry a dust cloth!

Title: Fantastic Beginner SLR
Content:
I purchased this camera in April of 2007 and i have been loving it ever since.  In terms of SLRs this one is very entry level.  It has a lot of different auto modes to chose from but i always shoot in P or "program mode".  The reason i gave it 4 stars is because of the lens that comes in the kit with it.  The Kit lens is crap!  I would recommend buying this camera body only! then buying a good lens. Something more all purpose like an 18-200mm.  Just make sure not to lose your eye cup!

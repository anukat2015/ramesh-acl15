Title: Very pleased!
Content:
As a long time Olympus I'm very pleased with the company's digital SLR. I own OM1, OM2 and OM4T film SLRs, but the E300 is going to cause all of these cameras to gather dust. The feel of the camera is solid, the turn on time is almost instantaneous and the focusing is lightning fast. The photos I've taken so far have been excelent in detaila nd color accuracy. I've blown one shot up to poster size with no problems.
The downloading software is nothing special, but get a card reader and don't even be bothered with the software driven downloads.
I recomend the E300 to anyone that is serious about their equipment and wants accurate and highly detailed photos. It's a steal at the current price.

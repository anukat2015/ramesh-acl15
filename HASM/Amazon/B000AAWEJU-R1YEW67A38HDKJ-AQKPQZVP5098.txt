Title: Wow!!!! What a vaccum..................
Content:
Well I spent 3 months researching all canister vaccums out on the market and kept going back to this miele.  Yes it is very expensive (about twice the price of its competitors) but it definitely out performs them hands down.
My floors have never been so clean in the 16 years I have lived in my current home.  I have mexican tile, pergo floors and carpet and the two attachments that come with the machine are incredible.
I have had machines break bits off themselves in the past because of my mexican tile (very uneven surface) and with the parquet floor head it is just a breeze to clean and it also does my concrete patio floor.  Amazing and then the head can be washed and away you go again.
Your oriental rugs with fringe are no obsticle for this vaccum because you have so many controlled settings to clean with.
For the first time ever I was able to clean my valances without taking them down, what a huge time and energy saver.
My husband thought I was completely nuts spending this kind of money on a vaccum cleaner but I am here to tell you that I will have this one for years to come and the service I will get locally is wonderful too.
So treat yourself you won't be sorry, I know I'm not.  I always hated vaccuming my house because I have a injured back but with this very lightweight model I do not have pain afterwards.

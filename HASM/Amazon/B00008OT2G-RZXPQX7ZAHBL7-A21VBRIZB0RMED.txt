Title: An Outstanding almost perfect Digital SLR
Content:
I have owned and used each of Canon's Digital SLR's - the D30, D60, the 1D and now the 10 D (I'll wait for the 1Ds to drop in price)  Of all, this camera outperms the others.  It's autofocus is much better than the D30 or D60 and the flash compatibility problems of the 1D are not nearly as evident in this new Camera.  The camera is lighter, yet sturdier than the others, although the 1D is probably stronger body.  The image quality of this camera is among the best of the Digital Slr' on the market - outperforming the Fuji & Nikon's, ...  The only draw back, which prevents a perfect 5 star rating, is the write speed and burst rate tends to be slower than the 1D.  ...  So who cares, unless you are shooting sports or other high action fast moving large quanity rapid burst photograph - save the bucks or get two of these - that's my plan

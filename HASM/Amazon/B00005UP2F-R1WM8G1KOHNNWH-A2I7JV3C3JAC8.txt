Title: surprised by a bagless
Content:
our good old hoover windtunnel self-propelled gave out on us after 4 years of service. Although I was happy with this vacuum,  I did not want to shell out another $300 to have it replaced. After reading the reviews, I decided on the vision dirt devil canister and am very pleased with my decision. It is very efficient with cleaning (sucks up ALL the dirt), relatively quiet (compared to my old hoover),cheap (1/3 of the cost of the windtunnel) and is light and easy to operate. I have yet to find anything wrong with it and would recommend it.

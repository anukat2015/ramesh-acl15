Title: perfectly pink
Content:
I love my new laptop. The keys are perfectly spaced, the small screen is awesome, the pink is perfect. I got this computer to go to college and I am so glad I did. I used to have another brand, but I always had issues. So far, this computer has done everything I wanted and has great features. I would highly recommend one if you dont want a mac or dell. Oh yea, the color is great.

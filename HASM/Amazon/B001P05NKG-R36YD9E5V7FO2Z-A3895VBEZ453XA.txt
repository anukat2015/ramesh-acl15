Title: Good Laptop for OS X and Win 7
Content:
I bought this laptop to replace a Dell Inspiron.  I have a Mac at home and wanted to be able to use some Mac programs at work but I still needed access to Windows, so I installed Win 7 in Bootcamp and also access it through VMWare.  I had some problems activating Windows in both Bootcamp and VMWare but that is a software issue, eventually it worked fine.  The laptop runs both OSs perfectly. I am writing this review in Windows 7 natively.

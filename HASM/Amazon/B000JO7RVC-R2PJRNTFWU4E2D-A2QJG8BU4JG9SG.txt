Title: Excellent music/video/entertainment portable device
Content:
This was only my second Ipod purchase (after the 2nd gen. Shuffle).  It was well worth the wait to get a great product at a great price. The music is easy to upload/change/customize with Itunes (just make sure your computer has a hard drive large enough), the music is easy to browse through with the "cover flow", you can upload playlists, the pictures get converted to a different format before loading onto the Ipod so it saves space, and one of the best features is the ability to upload games!!  Itunes has some great games to download/upload.  Phase is a good version of the Guitar Hero game.  Overall an excellent product.

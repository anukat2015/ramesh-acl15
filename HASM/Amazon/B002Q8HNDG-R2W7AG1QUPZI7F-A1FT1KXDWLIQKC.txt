Title: Poor workmanship
Content:
This coffee maker started out well. The scheduler option is wonderful. I work third shift and to be able to wake up to a fresh pot of coffee at 3am is a minor miracle. The only downside is that the pause option is useless. The spring that's supposed to hold back the drip while you pour a cup is very flimsy. If you don't wait until the full pot has finished brewing, the coffee will dribble down onto the hot plate and all over the counter.
Then, one morning last week I woke only to find the clock showed 12:00 (as if there had been a power outage) and no coffee in the carafe. Today, when I turned it on, the power light lit up but it would not brew. It finally did brew after unplugging and plugging it back in, but now the clock display is completely dead. We've had the machine less than a year.
Meanwhile, our 14-year old 4-cup Mr Coffee is still working perfectly (though unfortunately without a timer option which means it's relegated to tea purposes these days). You can even pour a cup in the middle of brewing, and it won't drip a bit. Proof that Mr Coffee *used to* make great products.

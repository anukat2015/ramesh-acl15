Title: Good product for the money
Content:
This is pretty good for the money.  Maybe not as wonderful as the $400 versions, but well within my price range and good enough.  I chose this to use on hand-woven rugs, where a rotating brush is not a good idea.  This works fine and can do all my rugs before getting full, unless I've been lazy.
Easy to clean and light enogh to carry around.  Needs some elbow grease to get dog hairs out of the rugs, but much less than the cheaper vacuum I was using, so a step up for me.  Also shipped and arrived lightning fast.  I'm happy with this purchase.

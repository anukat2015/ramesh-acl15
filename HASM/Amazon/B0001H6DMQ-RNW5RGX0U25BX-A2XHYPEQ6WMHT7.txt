Title: Strong suction, but  hard to move around
Content:
Ive had this vacumn for about 2 years. After about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way. Still has very good power. Bad news, it doesnt move around easy. It is like dragging an old tire around, hard to turn and direct, canister always rolls over. The only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt, and dont vacumn that often, i guess because i dread using it. I am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while. But still like i said, lots of power if you keep the filter clean.

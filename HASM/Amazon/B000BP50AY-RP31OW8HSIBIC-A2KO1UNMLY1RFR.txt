Title: Don't buy this mp3!
Content:
This mp3 player has been nothing but trouble within hours out of the box.  First, the screen became perma-'frozen up' within about 2 hours of getting it up and running. Second, it is less than cooperative when it comes to turning off OR on.  Third, it will not sync up to my computer when i connect the USB cable to my computer.  Maybe I bought yet another 'lemon', but I would certainly not ever buy this product ever again. On the upside, it comes with a lot of neat add-ons like an arm band, a cute protective cover and the sound & volume quality was pretty good...for the very short amount of time i was able to listen to the FM stations.

Title: Excellent Vacum Cleaner
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner because I've had good experience in the past with Eureka. I had a previous one to vacuum carpets, but now I live in a property that has all marble floors, so I needed a vacuum for floors. This vacuum is excellent for floors, and can do also carpets, but I would not recomment it if you have large areas with carpet. I suffer from allergies and I wanted a vacuum cleaner with a bag that you can just throw away, so this feature for me is a plus. It's is very light and small, easy to clean, maintain and store. I just love it.

Title: If you are experiencing a louding clicking noise after not using for a long time..
Content:
Just posting this for trouble shooting. I was getting a loud clicking noise while operating my Delonghi 6705L heater. In order to solve the problem I had to take apart the entire unit, disconnect all the electric wires and remove the heater coil from the resevior using a pair of channel lock pliers. You'll need to break the o-ring seal on the unit in order to remove the heater coil. I would not recommend this to the inexperienced user. If you do try it make sure to clean the metal o-ring sealing surface with a piece of fine sand paper before scewing the heater coil back in. Once assembled run the unit on high for a while and make sure that there is no oil leaking from the area.

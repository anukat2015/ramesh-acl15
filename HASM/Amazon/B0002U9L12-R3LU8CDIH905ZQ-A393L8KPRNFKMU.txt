Title: The bad reviews are correct
Content:
I came here to write a bad review, but I see many have cleared the path already.
The sides of the cup that holds the filter are too steep. The filters "cave in" easily, and then coffee grounds get in the coffee and clog the exit valve. (Crisply folded filters from one end of the package work better.) If you remove the pot before brewing is complete, coffee drips. Pretty soon coffee is on the bottom of the pot. Then it is anywhere where you put the pot down, but there's probably a mess there already because you can't pour out of the pot's spout without dripping.
It's easy to spill water into the filter area when filling the unit. This can aggravate the above problem. It's also easy to spill coffee into the water reservoir. The old Mr Coffee design where the filter holder swung out was so much better.
And why is there a heater under the insulated pot, a heater that just goes on during the time that hot water is being dispensed?
The instructions say to preheat the carafe with hot water if you want really hot coffee. (Not a problem for me.)
The resulting coffee itself is OK, as long as you don't insist on very hot coffee.

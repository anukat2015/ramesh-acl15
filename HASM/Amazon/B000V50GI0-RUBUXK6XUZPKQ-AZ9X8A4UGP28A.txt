Title: Good function, but cheap construction
Content:
I've had this heater for just over 3 years, and it works pretty good and heats my 10x12 room up quick, but the knobs are made from cheap plastic.  One of the knobs broke after about 2 years, and I've contacted Holmes about 4 times now and no one there seem to know what the heck I'm talking about and they just keep referring me to different numbers.  My heater is the exact same style as this, but it says 'Titan' instead.  But the warranty card states that it's manufactured by Holmes.  This frustrates me to no end, to have a heater w/  a 3 year warranty, but have the manufacturer say that they don't have the model in their system and that they can't do anything.  They don't even seem willing to help in figuring the problem out.  Don't you love mega-corporations.  The thermostat is touchy too, and is hard to set for a particular temperature.

Title: Probably only useful in VERY low humidity situations
Content:
I used this in our bedroom in our small apartment on the water in Los Angeles.  The company does make it very clear that it won't work well in high humidity environments but I would not characterize LA as being that way.  With that said, the unit would pump humidified air into our apartment which only added to the heat we were trying to get rid of.  People seem to have good luck in VERY low humidity locations, I figured around 50-60% was low enough...apparently not.
The unit arrived scratched and damaged but the situation was remedied after a long series of e-mails and phone calls.
Final words:  if you live in the desert or very very dry conditions it probably works well.  They don't call them swamp coolers for nothin'.

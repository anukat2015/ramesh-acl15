Title: Two Times Over
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a gift and my initial thought was wow! Beautiful machine. I used it daily for approximately 4 months, enjoyed the brew but then reality set in. Started noticing the excessive water condensation and messy clean-up. At about 10 months the pumping cycle began to shorten therefore leaving water in the reservoir. I was up to three power cycles before producing a full pot of coffee. I contacted Cuisinart - no response. It was put out to trash. Christmas roles around and whats under the tree.....yes, same model given to me by a friend. Lets just save that experience and simply carbon copy the original. However, the second one did last 15 months! This model obviously has poor design and Cuisinart is in denial.

Title: idiot pod nano
Content:
I feel I wasted my money and now lots of my time with this i pod.
First of all it was supposed to be engraved, was NOT. But I guess that's 
in my favor as it will be easier to resell.
The system for ordering through Amazon seems difficult. I usually end up getting the same thing more than once.
This i pod comes with little or no instruction. Downloading music is very
lengthy, no one seems to be able to help. 
The instructions are for people familiar with these things, not baby-boomers.
Basically unless you have a teenager available this pretty much is useless, for grown-ups.

Title: i like it.
Content:
Apple Nike + iPod Sport Kit for iPod nano 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, iPod touch 1G, 2G
I like it really. My dad has a Black iPod nano and I have a green one. The shake and shuffle thing is real weird. The iPod Red is weird. I mean, who knows where the money goes? I have 500+ songs and 50+ podcasts. And 130+ pictures. I don`t have Nike + iPod, but I like it.

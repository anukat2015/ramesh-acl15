Title: Great budget friendly coffee maker
Content:
I bought this for myself after going through two cheap coffee makers in 6 months. This machine definitely isn't the fanciest or most expensive, but it gets the job done. I like the 1-4 cup setting (it super heats the water for the smaller amount of coffee) and the fact that you can program both the brew time and the length of time before it shuts itself off. I'm taking away a star for the annoying beeping sound it makes when it's done brewing (you can't turn that off) and because it uses water filters that aren't cheap. The small opening to pour the water into hasn't been an issue for me.

Title: Works as advertised
Content:
I live in an older condo (built in the 50's) with parquet wood floors and high ceilings. The only source of heat in the main living area is a small wall unit in an awkward corner of the living room. I wanted something small and portable to provide a little extra warmth. This Vornado heater works as advertised... it emits a stream of warm (not hot) air and is virtually noiseless. I have it placed on an area rug and though the surface under the heater gets slightly warm, it is not a concern. The plug and cord seem durable and do not get hot or even warm as the reviews of other heaters indicated. 
Several reviewers of this heater said that it takes a while to heat up a room and/or the room never really gets warm. I think it depends on the size of the space you're trying to heat and whether or not this is the only source of heat you're using.

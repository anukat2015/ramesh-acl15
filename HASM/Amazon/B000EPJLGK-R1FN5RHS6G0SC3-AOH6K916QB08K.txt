Title: Not just for music!
Content:
I received an 80 Gig ipod as a gift (nice gift huh).  Anyway I loaded it will all of my music about 10,000 songs and was happily listening to my music.  Then one day I was browsing the itunes store.  They have videos and tv shows.  Cool, browsing around some more and noticed that they have my sons favorite cartoon, since we were going back east for Christmas I thought it would be cool to load the ipod with cartoons so I didn't need to lug the DVD player along.  Now my son loves it so much that when he's at grandma he needs his ipod.  That's right it's his 80 gig ipod now.  So I'm in the market for another one for mommy's music!

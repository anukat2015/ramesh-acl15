Title: Does not stay on....only 1 month old
Content:
I have this for one month and only used it for 3 hours in the garage and basement.  Now, the heater keeps going off. The phone number for tech/customer service does not work at Mr. Heater....The no. is off of the instructions and the same no. at MrHeater.com.   
Don,t waste your money.  Mr Heater sucks.   0 stars   Best to buy an electric or another brand.

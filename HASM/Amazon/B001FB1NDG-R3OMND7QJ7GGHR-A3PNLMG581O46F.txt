Title: ITS  BANANAS FOR THE PRICE, IF YOUR NOT GOOD WITH ELECTRONIX LEAVE IT ALONE
Content:
GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE, IF YOUR NOT GOOD WITH ELECTRONIX LEAVE IT ALONE. i WILL SAY THIS DUE TO THE WAY THE REVIEWS WERE GOING I WASN'T GOING TO GET IT, BUT, I AM VERY HARD HEADED.  WHEN IT CAME IN I WAS VERY HAPPY BECAUSE IT ONLY TOOK A FEW DAYS. NOW THE PLAYER ITSELF IS VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT AND THAT SURPRISED ME, BECAUSE ANY OF IT'S COMPETITORS WEIGH AS MUCH AS A HUMAN FOOT. TURNING IT ON IT HAD A FULL BATTERY SO I JUST IMMEDIATELY START PUTTING STUFF ON IT.  BUT FIRST I HAD CATEGORIZE IT. WASN'T HARD AT ALL JUST MAKE 3 NEW FOLDERS AS FOLLOWS: VIDEO,PHOTOS,MUSIC, AND YOUR DONE JUST START ADDING STUFF. NOW THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT THE GAMES SUCK BUT HEY THATS WHY I HAVE A PSP FOR, OH AND SOMETIMES WHEN I START A MOVIE IT CUTS OFF SOME TIMES, BUT YOU JUST TURN IT BACK ON. THE ONLY VIDEO THAT WOULD NOT TRANFER WAS RMVB FILES EVERY THING ELSE DID TRANFER WITH EASE.  SOUND IS GREAT BUT I DONT USE THE HEADPHONES THAT CAME WITH IT, OUTSIDE SPEAKER IS AWESOME ITS LOUD. YOU BARELY TOUCH THE SCREEN AND IT MOVES VERY IN SYNC WITH YOUR FINGER OR STYLUS. I'LL SAY THIS FOR SOME PRODUCTS LIKE THIS THERE ARE SOME BAD APPLES BUT THIS ONE I HAVE IS FULL OF AWESOMENESS.  IF YOUR NOT INTO THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF GADGETS YOU'LL GET FRUSTRATED, THINKING THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE AN IPOD TOUCH OR SOMETHING. ITS NOT AN IPOD ITS TONS CHEAPER AND SUPERKEWL FOR THE PRICE, I CAN USE THE EXTRA $145 TO DO ANYTHING WITH, SO PEOPLE OUT THERE AGAIN ITS NOT AND IPOD ITS GENERIC BUT IT DOES THE JOB NICELY. ALL IN ALL A GREAT PRODUCT BETTER THAN ALOT OF MP3/MP4 PLAYERS OUT THERE SO BUY IT AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK.  AGAIN IT IS NOT AN IPOD TOUCH JUST ITS CLOSE NEIGHBOR FROM ACROSS THE STREET .

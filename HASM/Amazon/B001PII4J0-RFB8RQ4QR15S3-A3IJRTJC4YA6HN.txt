Title: what a desappointement
Content:
this is my fourtn sony laptop in three years and the most disapponting
the screen you can eventually tolerate, the battery last barely 40 minutes , but the main problem
is how sloww and frustrating this laptop..
i am surprised that sony would release such a machine .
i returned it after 10 days of strugling despite the 250 restocking fee .

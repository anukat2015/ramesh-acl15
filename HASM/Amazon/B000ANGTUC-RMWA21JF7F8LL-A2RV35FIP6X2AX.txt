Title: bad heater
Content:
i was looking for a digitally controlled space heater to keep my bedroom warm at night while i turn the house heat down. i thought that the extra money spent for a honeywell and a digital thermostat would be worth it. was i wrong. i went through two of these because i was sure the first was a defect. the thermostat controls were way off....read 85-90 degrees when it was only 70 in the room. i didn't keep a constant temp and it was loud. both units did this
i bought another one instead...i think the brand was delonghi or something.

Title: Great but the wire gets warm
Content:
Every thing about this heater is great, but the wire gets warm upon high heat. 
I have used it all during the winter season with no issues though.
Also the pickup handle is a very bad design, it slips. 
Similar models has a place holder for remote in the tower it self, this one don't.
Personally, i don't mind the above, will put a better wire myself, the fundamentals of this are great.

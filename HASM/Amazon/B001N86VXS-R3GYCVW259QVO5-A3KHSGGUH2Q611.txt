Title: Nice little laptop for traveling
Content:
I love this laptop! it's so miniature and light-weight.  I just toss it in my back pack and off I go.  I also have a wireless air card which I got from AT&T, so I had get 24-7 internet anywhere.  There's also many wifi hotspots nowdays to take advantage of free internet.  
I'm going to Japan in a couple months.  I plan to put the laptop in hibernate mode, and when I need to look up a restaurant, or places to go, or translate something, I'll have the resource with me.
Things I didn't like about the laptop:
The laptop could use a built-in bluetooth.  The laptop taskbar had a bluetooth icon, but it says it's disabled, but I might get one of those miniature blueTooth dongles that sitcks out only a few millimeters.  I think HP could've put in a couple more USB ports, so I carry around a USB hub just in case.  Other than that, you should consider this laptop. I give it a 9.5/10 for this laptop.

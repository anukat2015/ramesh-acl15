Title: 7 years strong!
Content:
I've had my heat dish for almost 7 winters now.  It was a gift from my mother for Christmas for one of my first apartments.  Being a poor college kid, this was the perfect solution.  We could keep the heat down and still be comfortable.  Now that I am a home owner, I still use my heat dish.  My pets love the heat dish and as soon as I turn the thing on they all race for front row seating.  
*The only problem I have had with it is the light no longer works. It could be as simple as the bulb being burnt out, but since I never liked the light feature, I've never sought to replace (or fix) the light.  
I highly recommend for single person use.  I doubt if you are looking to heat more than a person it would be worth your money, since it is designed to direct a concentrated amount of heat to one area.

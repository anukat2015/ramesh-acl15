Title: This is one excellent vacuum cleaner
Content:
My wife and I were getting tired of buying a new low-cost vacuum cleaner every other year.  Something always broke or wore out on them.  And they always left dust in the air.
After a lot of research, we ordered the Miele Polaris.
We have had it now for a couple of weeks and we really love it.  It is extremely quiet, easy to maneuver, and leaves no evidence of dust in the air (try vacuuming in sunlight to see what I mean).  And it has suction beyond compare.  It will pull the dust bunnies from under those very hard-to-reach places.  The machine vents the exhaust air upwards; it doesn't scatter the dirt around like those cheaper, side-venting units do.
By the way, if you have a lot of laminate/hardwood and tile floors like we do, I highly recommend the parquet floor brush.  It makes short work of large areas and it glides along so smoothly over the floor.  The brush picks up everything; your floors are really clean when you are done vacuuming with this vacuum and brush!

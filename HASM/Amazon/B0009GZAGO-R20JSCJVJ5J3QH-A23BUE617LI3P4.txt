Title: Expectation to set straight for first time digital SLR owners
Content:
Like many others who have reviewed, I love this camera. For prospective buyers who are looking at the D50 as their first SLR I have an expectation to set.
You do not get a preview before taking the shot in the 1.8 inch screen. On recieving my new camera I spent about 30 minutes reading the instructions back to front to see if I could get a preview of the picture I was about to take. All non-SLR cameras give you this facility as standard.  It appears that this is either a limitation of digital SLRs or a feature not supported in the D50 camera. 
All said, I have no regrets buying this camera- it's easy to use and takes awesome shots.

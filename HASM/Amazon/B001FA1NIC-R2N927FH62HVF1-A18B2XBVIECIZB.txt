Title: Nice Product So Far
Content:
Just gave my Wife a Nano for Valentines Day. I have no experience with Apple products, but am pleased (so far) with the Nano. I set the Nano up for her, so I got to see the workings. It is a pretty cool product. The screen is great. The Nano itself was easy to set up and I had no difficulties. Like a lot of "computer" type things, problems are frequently "user errors". Anyway, so far, has performed well. Got it a J&R (needed it quickly!). Priced like Amazon. Only negative I see going forward is the ridiculous price Apple charges should you need a replacement battery, which will happen if the product holds up. I can't compare with Zune or others since this is only the first more expensive player I have used.

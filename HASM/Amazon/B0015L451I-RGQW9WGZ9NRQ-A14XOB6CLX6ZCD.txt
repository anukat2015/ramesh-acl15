Title: My first MP3 player
Content:
This is my first MP3 player.  Works really great and so far very reliable.  I added a MicroSD card for more memory. Sound quality is great with my old Sony Walkman earphones.  Loading via Windows Media Player is a little daunting and the reason for my four star rating. When I get some time I'll try just dragging directly rather than using the player.  Looking forward to loading audio books from the library.

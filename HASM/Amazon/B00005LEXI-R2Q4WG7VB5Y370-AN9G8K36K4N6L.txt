Title: Great little heater
Content:
Just as good as the great reviews I read. This little heater does the job in our van, when the outside temperature was below freezing, we were toasty warm inside. Just keep a window open a crack. The small bottle lasted 6 hours on low setting. I recommend it, so if you are thinking about it get it. You won't regret it.

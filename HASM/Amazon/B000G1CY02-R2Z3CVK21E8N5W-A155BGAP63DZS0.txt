Title: Died after only a few months
Content:
I do not recommend this product.  It was nice while it worked, but it died after less than 3 months use and I'm tired of constantly having to go through the return/warrantly process on poorly engineered electronics.
My $30, oil-filled radiator may run hotter, but it will be working when I need it to be.

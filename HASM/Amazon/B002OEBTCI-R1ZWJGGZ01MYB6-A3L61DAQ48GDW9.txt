Title: Excellent quality and great value
Content:
Go the camera about a week ago..and it has been a pleasure using it.
a) Excellent low light capability...I have taken it all the way to 6400 and works very well for 5*7 printouts
b) Love being able to use AA...I have shot 300+ shots without a dent to the battery. Will update review after using my Sanyo eneloop. 
c) The pentax lens selection has some very interesting primes...which are just not there if you are focused only on NikCan. I am planning to get a pancake 40mm soon.
d)Pricing was fantastic for the two lens kit..and it arrived in within 2 days..bravo amazon
e The physical construction and the small size is a major plus
A couple things to know
a) there is no SD card included..so order one when you get the cameras
b) Live view is slow..like with most SLRs

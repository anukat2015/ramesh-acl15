Title: One of the Best
Content:
After buying two other coffee makers with a carafe and returning them, I settled on this one.  I absolutely love this machine.  The carafe does pour slowly, compared to some machines, but you dont have to wrestle with the lid in the morning.  Once its ready to brew, you're done.  The programming was a little different too.  You have to turn the knob to your desired setting (program, time, etc) and then set the time.
All in all, you will be accustomed to this machine quickly and love it.  The coffee stays hot for hours and hours....up to 10 hours was our last count.  My husband makes the coffee at 4 am and when I get up at 7 am, its hot and ready.  Very nice.

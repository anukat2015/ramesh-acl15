Title: Reluctant to get a third one
Content:
These are great heaters, no doubt. But they don't last.
Bought the first one from Amazon, used it for a several months but then it smoked. Literally, the element started sparking. It was under warranty so DeLonghi sent me a new one. Used that one for a little over a year and then it just stopped working. No smoke but no heat either, nothing.
The last one wasn't under warranty so the bottom line is I bought a disposable heater that lasted for about 2 years for $90. I think I should get more mileage out of an appliance.

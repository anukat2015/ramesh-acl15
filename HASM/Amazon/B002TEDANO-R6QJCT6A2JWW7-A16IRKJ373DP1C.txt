Title: Amazing little laptop
Content:
I was about to buy the Acer 1410 back in August until I heard about the 1810. I held off for a couple of months and then bought the 1810 when it first became available. At first, I didn't think this laptop would replace the company's Dell 6400 in terms of power and convienece. I was pleasantly surprised that this little laptop was powerful enough to suit my needs. I have since turned the Dell 6400 back to IT and now only carry the 1810 on my business trips.
Pros: Portable form factor, light, HD screen, fast wireless card, gigaport, 3 USB ports, fast processor.
Cons: Takes a long time to charge, not the greatest mousepad, have gotten no where near 8 hours of battery life.
Overall, I've been extremely happy with my purchase.

The iPod Nano 4G 8Gb is my first iPod. I am well behind the power curve in music players.
My reason for acquiring one is that I just bought a new Trailblazer SS with the GM factory navigation system which MUST have the navigation CD in the player. So no CD based music with the system running.
Rather than spending a fortune for an after market CD changer the iPod with a Monster iCarPlay wireless plus gives you all the music you will need for just over $200 with shipping.
The 8Gb sure looks as if it will hold all the music and audio books you will want for the longest trip. But, the 16Gb model is not a huge increase in price.
Boy, talk about tiny. Sounds great, simple to use and loaded with features. The screen quality is amazing. This makes the Nano 4G a perfect photo album to show pictures to folks you meet along the way as well as relatives. And it attaches to a TV to display your photos.
One thing to check when buying accessories is to make sure they work with the 4G.
For example, the Monster FM system does NOT charge the 4G iPod.

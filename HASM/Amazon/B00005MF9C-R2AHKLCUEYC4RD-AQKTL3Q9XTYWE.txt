Title: B & D Brew n' Go Coffeemaker
Content:
I had bought this coffeemaker for my own use several years ago.  It has worked beautifully and continues to work without any difficulty even now.  I ordered it for friends this Christmas.  It arrived quickly and was received enthusiastically.  Both recipients of the coffeemaker repeatedly tell me how much they like the machine.  They use it for a single cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.  I also bought one for my daughter for college and she loves it.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a fresh, single-serving of a hot beverage.  The only thing that would make this product better would be to include or make available size 1 coffee filters.  I know this machine does not require a paper filter, but the coffee could use better filtration then the built-in filter provides.

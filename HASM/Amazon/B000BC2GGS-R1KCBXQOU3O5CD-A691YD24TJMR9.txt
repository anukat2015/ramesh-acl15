Title: Oversized heater with inconsistent controls
Content:
We bought this heater for our infant daughter's room. We were quite surprised by the size of the box it showed up in-- nearly 4 feet long. The heater is huge! Given that Amazon says the product dimensions are "12 pounds", we were rather taken aback by that. It is much too large for her room so we've had to return it. We also found the controls very confusing and inconsistent. Too many times in the two weeks we used the product we set the temperature for 72 degrees and came back to find the room 85+. That's very dangerous!
Amazon needs to change the dimensions on the product page to reflect the size, not the weight of the heater. And Honeywell needs to design a heater with somewhat less confusing controls!
We'll keep looking for a heater for her room....

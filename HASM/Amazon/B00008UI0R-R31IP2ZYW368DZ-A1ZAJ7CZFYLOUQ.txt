Title: Great vacuum--at first
Content:
At first, I loved this vacuum! The suction and ease of use was great. But only the second time I used it, when I went from carpet to a rug, the brush on the wand quit working--my husband took it apart to discover the belt had come off. So he fixed it and then it was fine....until about a week later. The same thing happened again!!!! Too bad. Needless to say--this vacuum is a thumbs down.

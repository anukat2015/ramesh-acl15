Title: Great on pet hair
Content:
I bought the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser and am totally pleased.  Compared to my Fantom Fury, this vacuum is a light weight.  I used it in my living room and the dust cup was filled after I swept half of the floor.  This sweeper almost seems like it is a self propelled model.  If you want heavy and hard to push, try a Fantom.  If you want a dust cup that is truly hard to empty, try a Fantom - oops I think the company that made Fantom  went out of business.  I do agree that assembly instructions were pretty much of a joke.  It took me a while to figure out what went where,  looking at the picture worked better than reading the directions.

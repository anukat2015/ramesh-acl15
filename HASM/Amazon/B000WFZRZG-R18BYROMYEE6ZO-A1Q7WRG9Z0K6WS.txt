Title: Great device
Content:
I'm really happy with my new Zune. I've had it for a few weeks now and it stores my music and pics and even videos. It's great. Only a few prob's, when I plug into computer to sync sometimes it needs to be restarted or my computer won't recognize the device, but it's a fixable issue. Also, some of my songs - that I purchased - are DRM protected and Zune software won't let u add that music to the player - that sucks. Other than those minor issues. It's a great player I'm very happy with it so far.

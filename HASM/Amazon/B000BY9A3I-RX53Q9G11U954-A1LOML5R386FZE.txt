Title: Good Little Vacuum
Content:
I bought this to do hardwood floors and reach tight spaces to get dust. It works great for that. The complaint some people had about the extra tools staying attache I don't worry about I just don't attact them. I don't have carpet just hadwood and title. It works great, filter cleans easy, and has alot of suction. I have used it about 6 time and so far has been a great purchase.

Title: Sony VAIO AW
Content:
The computer arrived in two days and exactly as advertised.  
I have spent the weeks since delivery learning the features of both the Sony and Vista Home Premium. To say there is a lot to learn would be a gross understatement. It will take several more weeks to get completly comfortable.
One point I would suggest long term mouse users consider is that you order a mouse with the computer.  I found it very difficult to get used to the mouse surface even after several adjustments.
The screen is incredible and I have decided  not to buy a seperate monitor. 
It has been very easy to set up wireless networking both at home and on the road at various airports. However, the size of this computer makes it difficult to travel with (it dosen't fit under a airplane seat and cannot be opened for use unless you are in first class).
All-in-all I would definitely recommend this computer as a desk top/side replacement.

Title: Faulty thermostat
Content:
This product produces enough heat to keep me warm and toasty. In fact, the manual says for the user to start the heater on "6" (highest setting) and then gradually lower it to a cooler temperature later. This cured my problem when I thought it just wasn't producing any heat. Unfortunately for me, the thermostat seems to be poorly programmed and the heater and fan will constantly flicker on and off as if it detects the heat as too high for one second, then too low the next. This causes a lot of noise and aggravation, especially when you're trying to sleep at night. Is this product worth it? I don't think so. It never should have made it to market without this simple problem being corrected. According to the reviews here, Vornado seems to put out a lot of faulty (even dangerous) products  and I would not recommend purchasing any of them.

Title: I was living with filthy carpets and never knew it!!
Content:
I got the Hoover s3765-040 after extensive research - I have a toddler and a 125-lb Golden Retriever, so I needed a good machine. I read all of the reviews about how the canister filled quickly, how heavy it was, etc.; but I am SO glad I bought this vacuum!!
I "cleaned" my carpet with my old vacuum (Hoover Spirit), and then used the new one. I could not belive the filth that this picked up! The first time I used it, the cup was filled after cleaning a carpet space about 10X15 feet with dust, dirt, old carpet fibers, dog hair . . . I became concerned, thinking I would have to empty this thing constantly while cleaning, but after the first few times I used it, the space I was able to clean got larger and larger without having to empty it. I think I am finally "catching up" and getting the deep dirt out. 
After a month, my rugs feel like they have been steam-cleaned after each vacuuming. 
It also does a great job on hard floors as well. The small brush attachment does a great job on stairs - but wear glasses or goggles - I have had things thrown up into my eyes/face twice when using it. 
The only downsides:
1. I had to find a home for the larger attachments that don't fit into the small compartment;
2. It would be nice if the carpet cleaner would stand upright when not in use;
3. I think I am going to need to buy a spare filter - the one has to be cleaned frequently, but, again, maybe it is because I am still "catching up" with cleaning and this too shall pass.

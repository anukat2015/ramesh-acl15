Title: Like my girlfriend, cute but dysfunctional
Content:
From the moment I received this unit, it became possessed by demons unknown to me. For starters, it would shut down without warning, mid-play; the only way to start it back up would be to take the batteries out and re-insert.  The ability to scroll songs failed entirely.  Creative Labs directed me to download drivers and other assorted "fixes", even though I was running the exact type of computer recommended by Creative that should by all accounts have worked seamlessly with the device.  The durability was immediately in question, the serial number (required by Creative to be able to return the bloody thing) mysteriously disappeared during light handling.  A total Lemon.  Get a Rio!  Oh, and one more thing, I have been trying to return it to Creative for about 3 weeks, and apparently no humans work there that I may speak with.  An exchange of fruitless emails has resulted in NADA.

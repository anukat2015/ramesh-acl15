Title: Great camera, good for a novice
Content:
I purchased my A200 on a whim - I am not a professional photographer by any means, just a enthusiast who wanted something better than your normal run of the mill point and shoot.
For a person of limited experience such as myself - mostly sticking with the Kodak's and other smaller devices, my first DSLR was a welcome change and the interface is actually very intuitive.  Being able to take multiple shots right after another - bang-bang-bang - is an amazingly nice convenience.  Also, the additional lenses are a great bargain - being able to do both macro and zoom shots by swapping out a lens is nice after being limited to specific zooms.  I can't say enough about how great it is that Sony allowed the use of Compact Flash cards instead of just Sony Memory sticks (which are generally smaller and overpriced).  I prefer SD cards but there are quite a few CF to SD adapters so that's not much of an issue.
I don't have much experience with the supplied software as I prefer to take the memory card and put it directly into my laptop instead of using a USB transfer.

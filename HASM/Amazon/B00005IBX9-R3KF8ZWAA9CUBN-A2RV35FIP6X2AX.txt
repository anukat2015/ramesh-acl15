Title: great coffee maker
Content:
after much research, i bought this coffee maker. i've used it for a couple months now and it's great. it makes a great cup of coffee and has great features. i love the gold filter...no more paper filters! 
the only drawback is that the water reservoir has a small opening...which makes it hard to pour the water into.
other than that, it's a good choice.

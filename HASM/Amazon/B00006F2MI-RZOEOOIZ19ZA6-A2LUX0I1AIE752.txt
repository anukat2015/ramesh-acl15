Title: Grinder is like the Space Shuttle taking off
Content:
The grinding mechanism is very loud and it will serve as an alarm clock as well. As everyone else has mentioned, it's very time consuming to take apart and clean each time. This maker, which was replaced by Cuisinart in March, has started cutting off just like the other two. The unit will beep after 2-3 minutes as if it is finished. It will eventually brew a pot of coffee if you start it at least 45 minutes prior to when you want it.  We've contacted Cuisinart about this, paid the $10.00 shipping fee each time and have received 2 replacement coffee makers over the past 3 years. Changing the charcoal filter and decalcifying with vinegar has no bearing on the problem. I suspect that Cuisinart is shipping out reconditioned units each time. It's getting rather annoying and I definitely would not recommend this machine. However, it does brew great coffee if you can wait long enough and put up with the aggravation. This was a gift and my sister who has the same has been using hers for years without any difficulty at all. However, we're considering other "brew and grind" options.

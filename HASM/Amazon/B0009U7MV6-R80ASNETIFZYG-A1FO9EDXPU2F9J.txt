Title: Very good camera
Content:
Im new to SLR cameras, but have had digital cameras for about 5 years. I bought this one to enter in the in the SLR world and all I can say is it has exceeded my expectations.
Before this one I owned a Canon Powershot G3 and a SD30, this one feels much better than those.
Maybe for a pro it lacks some features, but for newcomers like me its perfect.
I have a lot to study, but my first impression after a few weeks is that I made the right choice.

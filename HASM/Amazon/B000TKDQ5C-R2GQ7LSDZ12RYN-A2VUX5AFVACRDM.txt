Title: Great little heater!
Content:
This is a great little heater - Emphasis on little!
I must say, I was surprised when I received the package - yes, I should have checked the dimensions before ordering, but I didn't.
So don't expect this little guy to heat up a room of any size... but it is great as a spot heater.  We use it in the kitchen first thing in the morning while making the first round of coffee...  If it's a particularly cold morning, we'll use it to heat up the bathroom while showering, etc.
Bottom line, it's really good for it's size and price, that's why I gave it 5 stars.
Don't forget the product description does say "for personalized comfort."

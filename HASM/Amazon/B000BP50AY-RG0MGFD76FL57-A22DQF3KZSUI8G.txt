Title: SanDisk...at risk!!!
Content:
Bought this unit for my son who has Autism and needs a simple, easy to synch., easy to operate unit.  Opened on Christmas Day, loaded the software, synched with WMP, loaded battery and then...pfffft.  Nothing.  Went to San Disk's web-site and registered a service issue.  No reply at all.  Obtained RMA from Amazon and returned for refund.
Should have stayed with either Creative, iriver or RCA.  Ended up buying an RCA 1GB Sport at Amazon as a replacement.  Beware of the sansa.

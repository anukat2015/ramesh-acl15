Title: Very happy with this product
Content:
I was hesitant to buy this coffeemaker after reading the mixed reviews on it but I didn't see any other undercabinet coffeemakers out there that looked better so I went for it. We loved our previous 10 year old model that finally quick working. We now love this one. Reading all the reviews was extremely helpful, particularly related to the installation process and getting the top mounting bracket off the first time. I used a flathead screwdriver and twisted toward the arrow with little bit of pressure and the bracket came off. I knew that the template doesn't work as is so I used it to come up with my own template that did work. It just takes a little thinking it through first. I also knew to go to a hardware store and buy #10 1 1/2" machine flathead screws to use instead of the ones provided. These worked well. Other than that we've had no issues with water or coffee overflow or any other issues. It was helpful to know what to watch for. My husband was afraid to make coffee the first time but when I did it worked fine. The coffeemaker works well, looks good and saves space on the counter. I can't ask for more.

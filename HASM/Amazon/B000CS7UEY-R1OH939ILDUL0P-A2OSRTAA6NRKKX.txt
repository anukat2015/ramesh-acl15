Title: good sound, impossible controls, poor service, inconvenient charging
Content:
I purchased this MP3 player in February. I listen to recorded books downloaded from my library and needed more than 1G storage.  The player downloads well and holds as many books as one could wish, but it is next to impossible to access them. The touch pad is either too sensitive or too insensitive so that while one can see many options, it is not possible to reliably choose any. I sent it for repair while under warranty and they sent it back the next day but the touchpad still doesn't work properly. Given that sending it for repair entails packaging, insuring and mailing costs and since I had sent it for the same problem previously, there seems to be no point in trying again. So I can now download books and keep going to "album of the day" and hope the book I want shows up there. Phone help, by the way, costs $ after the 90 days warranty has expired. Finally, it seems it will only charge on a PC USB slot, not on a Mac or the same shaped cell phone charger/adapter that plugs into regular electricity and charges my Samsung YP-T7J (a very easy to use and far superior device though less storage).  I also have an Ipod Nano but my library downloads will not play on Mac products.

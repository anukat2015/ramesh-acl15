Title: Good little unit, but gets too hot
Content:
I have the heater under my desk at the office for those extra chilly days.  The range of temperatures seems too small, in that it gets pretty hot, pretty fast on  fairly low temperature setting, so then I need to shut it off.  If I try to use a lower temperature setting, then the unit won't come on, as the room isn't cool enough for it to kick on.  However, I think given the cost and it's extremely small size, it's an overall good value.

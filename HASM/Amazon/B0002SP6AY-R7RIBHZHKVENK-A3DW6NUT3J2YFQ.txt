Title: Hunter Fan Programmable Thermostat
Content:
The thermostat performed as advertised. I had had some trouble finding a thermostat for my gas stove. Since it was a 8 to 10 year-old model, I could not find a specification. By combining the simple instructions for installing the thermostat with intuition, I was able to successfully install the thermostat. I'm very happy with its performance.

Title: Trying to Decide between Canon or Nikon?
Content:
I am a yearbook sponsor at a high school.  We have both Canon XTI's and Nikon D80's.  I can only tell you that the Canon has produced better pictures and been more durable than the Nikon.  The students prefer to take pictures with the Canon.  We even had a photographer get hit with a soccer ball while taking a picture.  The Canon took the whole force and was not damaged.  
If you want reliability and ease, I would go with the Canon over the Nikon.

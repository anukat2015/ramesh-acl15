Title: Strong & Effective Lightweight!
Content:
I searched around for a long time trying to find a good balanced notebook/laptop.  I chose this ASUS because of its look and features--it is a gift for my wife.  I wanted to give her something that would be up-to-date and provide her with rich features and elegant look...this K52F-A1 provides that!  Though I am the one that set it up after receiving it--I let her unpackage it and do all the basic setup--by updating the Windows 7 Update, she loves this laptop.  I could tell by the look in her face she was very pleased with the gift.  It has good clean crisp look, the screen has amazing clarity.  The keyboard is smooth, easy to use, with all the keys easy to touch.  Each key has the appropriate amount of space between each key.  My wife commented that it was very light weight, not the heavy laptop that it looks to be.  She loved that it is light.  After taking the laptop into my hands, I could see why she stated that...it is very light, though it looks heavier because of the sturdy construction.  Very sturdy and strong.  I like the matted look & feel of the palm rest and the touchpad.  This is a great product with rich features (Core i3, 4Gb DDR3, 320Gb HD, etc.) for the price! It doesn't have everything I want in a laptop, but for anyone needing top-of-the-line with a budget, it is an excellent choice.  Which is why I give it 5-stars.  I am very pleased I chose this and that Amazon.com provided great service; arrived on time, strong packaging, and just all great service.  Thanks Amazon.com!ASUS K52F-A1 15.6-Inch Versatile Entertainment Laptop (Dark Brown)

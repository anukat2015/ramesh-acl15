Title: Braun's the best!
Content:
This is my 2nd Braun.  My first one was lovingly used until it just quit on me.  In desperation, I needed a quick coffeemaker, and ran to the local discount store for a Black and Decker.   After two years of the B&D, I got tired of mediocre, lukewarm coffee and decided to try a Braun again.  I'll never again NOT have a Braun.  The quality, the purified water, the gold filter, and the temperature of the coffee will always keep me as a fan and loyal user. I didn't know what I was missing until I went back to the Braun. The KF590 is just right.

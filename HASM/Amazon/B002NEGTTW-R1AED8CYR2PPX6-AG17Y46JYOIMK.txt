Title: Canon 7D - a great buy for the price
Content:
Heavier than my old Canon Digital Rebal but packs a lot more punch.  I have to hunt for some of the menu options but I'm getting used to it.  I shot an HD video of a rental condo I own and the video feature worked very well.
I really appreciate the feature to shoot in JPG but to switch to JPG and RAW with the touch of one nicely placed button.  Easy to switch from photo to video.  The lens that comes with the camera (if you buy the basic lens and body option) has a much nicer range than my original rebal lens.
This is a fantastic camera, in regards to options, for an intermediate level photographer.  There are lighter, smaller cameras that are easier to use but this camera has far more features and the ability to shoot in 1080p HD video.

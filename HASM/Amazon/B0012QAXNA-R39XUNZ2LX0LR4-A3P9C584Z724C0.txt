Title: good for entry level
Content:
My first DSLR was pentax *ist DL. this is the second one. My current one is Nikon D90.
COmparing the image quality, pentax really lacks comparing to Nikon. Pentax has much more noise in the same ISO setup. The lens (18-200) is not as sharp as Nikon's 18-200. The difference does not need to be tested in labs but can be told clearly by eyes. Although it is not a fair comparison because of the price difference, my point is that if you do need a high quality DSLR to start with, go with Nikon or Canon, while if your most concern is budget, Pentax is cheaper but "cheaper" image quality as well.

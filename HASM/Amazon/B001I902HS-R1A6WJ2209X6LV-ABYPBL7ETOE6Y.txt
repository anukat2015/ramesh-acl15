Title: Panasonic MC-CG885 OptiFlow Lightweight Bag Canister Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
I purchased the vacuum 1 month ago.  I used other reviews to determine that this was the best vacuum to meet my needs.  I am overall pleased with the machine.  I really like the fact the on-off button is on the handle and I do not need to bend to change the settings.  I can easily change the function from capet to floor with my finger.  It has nice suction, which is a plus for me, since I live in a sandy community.  It fits in my closet snuggly, another plus.
The only negatives that I think may be universal for any vacuum, is that I have to "pull" the canister around, and I find it a bit heavy.  Secondly, it is noisy--but I have never had a vacuum that is not noisy.
I would definitely purchase this again.

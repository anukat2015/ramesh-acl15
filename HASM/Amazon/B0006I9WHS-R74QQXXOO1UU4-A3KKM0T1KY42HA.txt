Title: Morning Delight on a Cold Winter's Day
Content:
C'mere, baby. Put me right there. Yeah, that's it. Now plug me in. Oooo you can fell my warmth right away, can't you, baby? Turn it up a little...my button's right there. Higher. Higher. Yes. Yes. Yes!
Yep, that's me and my Honeywell HZ-315 Quick Heat Ceramic Heater almost every day this winter. After I get my Honeywell started, I take a nice hot shower. She waits for me in the bathroom in a safe place away from the water; she hates water. She'd fry me if I got her...um...wet.
Truth be told, it is indeed my bathroom exclusively where I like to use the Honeywell HZ-315 Quick Heat Ceramic Heater. And she lives up to her name: "Quick Heat." I have a pretty big bathroom, but the house's heating rails are on one side of the bathroom, and the shower and the "his" sink/vanity are on the other. So it gets a wee bit chilly on my side of the bathroom in the mornings. Not a problem anymore. 
I just get the Honeywell HZ-315 going before my shower, and she takes goooood care of me when I get out. Seriously though...keep her where she won't get wet and don't forget to shut her down immediately after use, and she won't burn ya. 
I always unplug too as soon as I'm done. She cools down immediately, in fact she never gets too hot while in use...well, maybe the front a little bit.
So don't you wish you were hot like me? You know you want it now. Put this Honey in your cart.

Title: Creative Vision M-White
Content:
I am so madly in love with this product!  Just USB it into the computer and drag-n-drop what I want on it.  I did not install accompanying software as Windows Vista recognized it right away!  I mainly use it for songs only.  The touch pad is very sensitive and takes a bit to get used to.  Very easy to navigate!  Had no freeze ups as stated in other reviews.  It does however, get fingerprints easily...Problem solved by buying a cover!  Earphones are fine but purchased in-ear phone for the hell of it!  Purchased white because I wanted the entire player to be the same color.  Defiinately purchase an A/C adapter for this...USB takes 1000 years to charge!

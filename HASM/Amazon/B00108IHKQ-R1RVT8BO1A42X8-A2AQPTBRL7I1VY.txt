I purchased this lap-top as a birthday present for my wife, having had experienced excellent performance with a VAIO that I purchased for myself in back in 2004. I was a bit leary about making an on line purchase of such a potentially fragile item. Those worries were put to rest upon delivery, as it was apparent that extra care had been taken to ensure that delivery was prompt, and the product arrived in good condition. 
My only regret in making this purchase, is that I didn't pay more heed to the concensus on reviews of the VISTA operating system (which came pre-installed on the unit). In the past, I had always heard of, (but pretty well dismissed) all of the negative publicity surrounding the release of a new O.S., because I had never experienced any insurmountable problems with O.S. up-grades over the years, some just took some getting used to. With VISTA however, you can add me to the list of "whiners". So many things are incompatible, and there are so many "unexplainable" malfunctions, that after 3 weeks of unsuccessful back-and-forth communications with Microsoft Vista Support (via another PC I might add, as we were unable to even perform e-mail & on-line functions with VISTA), I finally gave up & "up-graded" to XP. Things have been fine since then.

I love this thermostat, i am waiting to see the saving on my heating bill soon.  I was able to program the thermostat to heat the house before my family awake in the morning and before we return home in the evening.  Otherwise the temperature is decreased dramatically.
I only had one problem though,  I forgot to set the setting for the weekend. So my weekends were cold for a minute.  But now they have been set.  If you are interested in purchasing this thermostat, you will not be disappointed.

Title: Great Radiative Heater!
Content:
There are a lot of reviews saying this thing is TINY, it's not that small. It stands roughly 14" tall and 10" wide, and puts out well more heat than a traditional space heater of three to four times the wattage. 
It's very easy to use, no maintenance necessary, absolutely quiet, powerful, precise heat directionality, and heats up very quickly (within 30sec).
       ---------------------------
The good: powerful, efficient, precise;y targetable, quiet, safe.
The bad: can be a bit bright to have facing you while you sleep, I just aim mine below eye level in my direction and let convection do the rest.

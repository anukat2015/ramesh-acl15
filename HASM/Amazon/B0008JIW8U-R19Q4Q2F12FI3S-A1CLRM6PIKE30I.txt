Title: too small
Content:
It's a cute little coffee maker and it works geat; but it's a little too small.  I don't who measured this as a 4-cup but it's more like a
2-cup.  I gave it to a teacher friend for her classroom and bought a larger coffee maker.  If all you want is one cup of coffee it would be just the right size.

Title: Aside from the headphones, awesome system
Content:
I have a massive CD collection. I have stored hundreds of my favorites onto a 6 oz. device. It's like carrying around several hundred CDs. I love it. It deserves 5 stars.But let me warn you all about the headphones. I am a runner--one of the reasons for me forking over the cash for one of these is so I can take my CD collection with me when I jog. But I swear, I could not get 10-feet w/o the provided earphones flopping out of me ear; in other words, they don't fit very well into my ear cartilage. The designers should have made a better earphone. Now I have to fork over [money amount]to get some new earphones. But still, the 5-star rating is warranted.

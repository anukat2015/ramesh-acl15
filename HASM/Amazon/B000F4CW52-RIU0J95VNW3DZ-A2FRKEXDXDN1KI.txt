Title: Had this vacuum now for nearly three years and it's still going on strong!
Content:
Before purchasing the Dyson DC14, I'll have to admit that I had been indecisive in getting a vacuum cleaner because other brands were coming with their own similar version and they were much, much cheaper.
In the end, I decided that I need to bite the bullet and look for a vacuum that would last me a long time and every review on Amazon, people talked about how durable and how the suction has lasted for years.  Whereas the cheaper versions on the market, not really.
So, I purchased this three years ago and I wanted to wait on my review and see if this vacuum would truly last.
And I'm here to say that my DYSON DC14 is still going strong.  I am just amazed how this vacuum continuously performs aggressively in removing dirt, animal hair, dust, etc.
It's easy to use and I'm glad I didn't go for the thinner, smaller version because for my house, that cannister would have been full to quick.  So, all in all, it was money well spent.
It was hard for me to purchase because of the cost but with all said and done, unlike other vacuums that slowly gotten worse overtime, again...three years now and it's still going on strong.  So, it was worth the money spent.
Highly recommended!

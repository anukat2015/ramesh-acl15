Title: Disappointed with textured touchpad & short battery life
Content:
I do not like the bumpy, textured touchpad - my finger catches frequently even with the lightest pressure and it is simply unpleasant to the touch, especially during long hours of use.  The experience is obnoxious enough that I am considering getting rid of this laptop after only a few days!
Battery life is only ~2 hrs, not 5 as advertised.
Otherwise, the laptop is fast and attractive.

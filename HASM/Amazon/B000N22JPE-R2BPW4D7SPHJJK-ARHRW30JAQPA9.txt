Title: Good coffeemaker with a few shortcomings
Content:
This coffeemaker replaced a dead Krups.  It makes very good coffee but it has a few design quirks that I think are going to be annoying in the long run.  The coffee filter basket is not able to stand on its own, so you must fill it with coffee while it is installed in the unit.  So, if you spill coffee it goes right into the unit.  This is a problem because the inside of the tank area stays wet all of the time because the lid incorporates the water jet that sprays hot water on the coffee.  The condensation stays in the machine and the whole thing stays wet.  Also, the tank has a very small opening in which to pour the water, and the gauge on the side is very hard to read.
I liked the Krups better, but their quality has deteriorated over the years and it seems that a Krups is only good for about two years before it croaks. We'll see if the Cuisinart is any better.

Title: Don't buy if you want to use the video/movie function!!!
Content:
We bought a portable DVD player with an iPod dock a month ago specifically for this new iPod, but Apple changed it's software so that none of the new iPods can be shown on older/unapproved DVD players! Also, if you want to plug it into your TV, you have to drop $50 to buy a specific cable! The iPod Classic will ONLY show video on equipment that has a special chip in it supplied by Apple.
Don't waste your money unless you are willing to buy all new equipment to show the videos on!!!

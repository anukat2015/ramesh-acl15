Title: Great Quick Cup of Coffee
Content:
This is the prefect coffee maker for people who drink a few cups of coffee throughout the day, but hate to clean and make the coffee. My wife makes a cup in the morning before work, I have one later in the day and we both get together for a cup at night and it's perfect. On the weekends when we might have several cups each I do use my conventional coffee maker, but it seems like a chore after using this maker. The water heats from cold very fast (under 1min) and so far I have not had any problems. I would highly recommend this coffee maker to anyone. The optional reuseable cartridge lets you use regular coffee or make hot cocco at a fraction of the price of the K-cups. Nice.......

Title: Cuisinart grind &amp; brew
Content:
Our Cuisinart is less than a year old and the front panel to open to clean the filter is constantly jammed.  The door does not slide in nor will it slide closed without a hard push.  Very disappointed with the product considering how much we payed.  I'm going back to a regular coffee maker

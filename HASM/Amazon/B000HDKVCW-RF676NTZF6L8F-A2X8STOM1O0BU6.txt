Content:
I am quite pleased with my new coffee maker. It does everything it says it will, hot coffee, prepared in less than 6 minutes, and the warming carafe keeps my coffee hot for hours. The complaint about the carafe dripping/leaking when pouring coffee is not occurring with my unit. Make sure you buy the filters, when you buy the maker. They're a bit more difficult to locate locally than I anticipated.

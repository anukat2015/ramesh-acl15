Title: Made in China
Content:
I just received the order of this coffee maker. When I opened up the box, the first thing I noticed is the print "Made in China". When I pay $65 for a basic function coffee maker like this one I expect something from Japan. I have some appliances at home from same brand they are "Made in Japan". Be aware!

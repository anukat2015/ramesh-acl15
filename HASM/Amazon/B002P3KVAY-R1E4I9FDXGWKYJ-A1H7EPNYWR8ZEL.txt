Title: A Competent Netbook/Notebook
Content:
I have the Acer Aspire AS410-2039, 11.6 inch, Black with Windows 7 Premium. Everything I have asked this little computer to do, it has done well - from Skype with video to photo editing with Adobe Photoshop Elements 7. It is fast and the screen is very sharp and clear. Acer has intelligently jumped the artificial barriers of Intel/Microsoft's netbook specs.
I still consider it a Netbook and is a considerable advance over my Asus 701 with a 7" screen. My new netboook is about 2 pounds lighter than my 15.3 inch laptop.
Highly recommended.

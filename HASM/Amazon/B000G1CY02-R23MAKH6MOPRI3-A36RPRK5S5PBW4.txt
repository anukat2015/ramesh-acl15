Title: Wow, is it on?  Oh wait... it is, but it is still 10 degrees in here.
Content:
Purchased this as an additional heater for an addition on our home, it does not put off enough heat to even notice it is on.  It may work in a really small room, but for a larger room it does not even seem to make a dent in the temperature of the room.  Mine is going to be returned.

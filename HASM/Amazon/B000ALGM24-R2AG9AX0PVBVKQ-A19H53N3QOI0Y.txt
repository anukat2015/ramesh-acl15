Title: Good Value, Easy Installation
Content:
I bought two of these, one for each of the up and down zones.  Installation was straight-forward and the instructions cover a lot of different scenarios regarding one's existing system to which the unit will be applied.  The feature which provides for anticipating the lead time to get to a set point is clever (for example, if you have set a low temp for the night and want the house to be at a higher temp at 7:00a, the unit calculates how early it needs to get started to reach the higher temp by 7:00a, based on the actual temp in the house during the night).  Also, it has convenient overrides (for example, Home Today - which puts the set point at the highest temp in the current program cycle).  The Indiglo dial (like a Timex watch) is also a good enhancement for night viewing. I'm convinced that this is an valid conservation measure which can pay for itself in a reasonable time span.
Since the purchase, I have learned that some other units allow independent programming of the fan (only), so one could, for example, stir up the air in the house for a few minutes each hour without turning on the heater/AC.  This should provide better economy and uniform temp in all rooms.  I don't know if Hunter makes one like that, but apparently that isn't a feature of this unit. I would check into it if starting over.

Title: Makes good coffee, filter holder moves around
Content:
The Elite Cuisine 4-Cup Pause-'n-Serve Coffeemaker makes very good coffee - comparable to our Cuisinart coffee maker, which is quite good.
The filter holder doesn't seem to stay put after you put coffee in it and swing it closed; the top of the coffee pot seems to snag on it - need to hold the filter holder shut while removing the pot.
Otherwise a nice product; quite small, but big enough to make two cups (all coffee makers have too small a cup serving).
I'd buy it again.

Title: Good for the price
Content:
We bought this heater last fall, and it kept us warm all winter while sitting on the couch. It's not going to warm a room, but if you want something to keep you warm while you're sitting at the computer, reading, watching tv, etc., this will definitely do the job. 
Our only complaint was the incredibly short cord.

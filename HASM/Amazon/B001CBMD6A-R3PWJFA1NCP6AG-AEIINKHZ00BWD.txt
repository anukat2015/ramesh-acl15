Title: Nice Camera, but defective
Content:
Received this through Amazon for Xmas.  "Error 99" repeatedly occurred.  Tried a different battery, different memory card, clean lens contacts as recommended.  Tried a different lens.  No fix.
Will be sending back to Amazon for credit.  Will have to think about ordering another of the XS.  Maybe try an XSI?  Seems people on this site have had focusing problems with that though.

Title: High maintenance/Pathetic design/Leaks all over
Content:
This unit will cool your place by 10 degrees within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. 30 minutes) but you will also need to empty the drain pan (for water) every hour or two/if that long/or else your carpets will be soaking wet from the drain pan that overflows. Even when you DO empty it on time, the design of the pan makes it very easy to spill water all over the place and DON'T forget the cheasy hose! Once you pull the drain pan away from the air conditioner, it continues to leak water all over the floor through that cheasy hose.

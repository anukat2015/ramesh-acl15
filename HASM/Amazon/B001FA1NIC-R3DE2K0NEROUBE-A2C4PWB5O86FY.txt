Title: Love It!
Content:
I just got this iPod and I love it! This is my first iPod and I am impressed with its features, sound quality and ease of use. The sound is supbeb, the games are nice if you're bored, and it was very easy to learn how to use. The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the battery life; it could last a little longer, but it's not a big deal. The display is nice and clear and you can see what you're reading.
If you're an average Joe who is looking for a decent media player at a reasonable price, then I would look into this product! (I got the 16 GB model for $150; not a bad price considering it's Apple!)

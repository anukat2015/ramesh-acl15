Title: Excellent.
Content:
I bought this heater two months ago and am enormously happy with my decision.  My room is insulated quite well but exceeds the manufacturers' specs by several cubic feet.  Still, the heater works like a dream.  After going through last winter with a $70 piece of garbage that caused the temp to fluctuate wildly, I am even more appreciative of the automatic temperature control of this heater.  I don't use the remote because I think the unit is more than effective without it.  Spend the extra few dollars for this one; you'll be glad you did.

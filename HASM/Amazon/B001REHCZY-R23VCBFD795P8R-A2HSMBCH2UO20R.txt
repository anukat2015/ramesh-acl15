Title: cheap plastic
Content:
This is a nice looking coffeemaker but the plastic is highly breakable. Do not accidentally drop any parts or you'll hear chunks of plastic flying across your kitchen! Don't even drop it in the sink. The filter came apart in three pieces. Please make one more sturdy since it's an item that people handle everyday. I'm a nervous wreck whenever I set the coffee!

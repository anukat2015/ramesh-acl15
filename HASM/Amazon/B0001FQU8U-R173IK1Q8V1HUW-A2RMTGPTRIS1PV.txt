Title: Poor packing--damaged product
Content:
The first unit I recieved appeared to have been dragged behind the delivery truck. The plastic casing was smashed in several places.  Amazon customer service promptly sent me another unit which arrived with a broken coaster. I'm keeping this one to avoid the re-shipping hassle, but dissapointed with the purchase.

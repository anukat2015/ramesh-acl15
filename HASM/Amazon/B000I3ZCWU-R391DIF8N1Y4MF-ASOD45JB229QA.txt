Title: Canon Rebel xTi: A Winner
Content:
With 3 weeks under my belt with my new Canon Digital rebel XTi 10.1 MP SLR, I can only say I remain thrilled and happy with my purchase. With my last quality camera purchase being a Canon SLR in the early 70's, I have been blown away by how "smart" this camera is and how easy to use. One can use it in automatic mode and not worry about the technical aspects, or go deep into manual customized photography. This camera is a great deal, and everything as advertised. Can't wait to add a zoom!

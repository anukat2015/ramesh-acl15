Title: amazing vacuum
Content:
Very pleased with this vacuum. I like how you can control the suction control. It's self propel feature is better than my upright Hoover! The canister has come along way from the old versions. It would be nice if the bagless canister held more dirt but it beats buying bags. The whole machine is VERY light so if you have a bad back this is your answer to lifting and pulling a heavy vacuum and the wand extends for the tallest person. I've had no problems with it.

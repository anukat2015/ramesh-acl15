Title: Junk!!!
Content:
All the ads made this sound really good, so I bought one early on.  However, it made horrible coffee --- I tried using different amounts of grounds but it made no difference the coffee did not taste good.  It tasted like instant coffee that you used to get at BK.  My guests did not like the quality of the coffee either so after a couple of weeks I gave the coffee maker to Goodwill.

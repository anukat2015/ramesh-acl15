Title: Well, Actually 3+
Content:
I bought this unit to keep my menopausal roommate comfortable in her room at the back of the house. I live in the central valley of California. We average over 100 the entire month of July, and upper 90s through August (just sayin', you guys who can get cooler than 78 by opening a window). My central air keeps the west end of the house tolerable most of the time, but the east end of the house just never cools off. 
So before she moves in, I tell her the back room gets pretty warm and she tut-tuts and assures me that she's one tough broad, and really she is. Only after three nights, she 'fesses up to not sleeping on account of she's so overheated back there. Begin the shopping for a small air conditioner. Here is what I found -- this one is pretty decent looking, it is very reasonably priced, it looks miles better than units costing twice as much. I shopped through Amazon, ordered the thing in 5 minutes or less and the manufacturer notified me within 24 hours that the unit was on its way. Well before the deliver-by date, the unit showed up on my front porch, well-packaged and in perfectly good condition. 
The only reason this is a 3 and not a 4 is that the set-up required some extra parts and finagling that we hadn't expected. On the other hand, two cranky, hot, menopausal women got the thing up and running within half an hour, and finished with a pretty decent set-up in another half hour the next night. Roommate says it's a little noisy, but keeps the room cool, looks pretty OK and is way better than sleeping sweaty. Her landlady says she spent way less than she might have for a better product. Both menopausal women less hot, less cranky and generally pretty pleased.

Title: Great While It Lasted...
Content:
I bought this for my dad at Christmas.  It performed very well for about five weeks.  Then it died.  Black and Decker said the s/n is out of warranty, so now we're in the process of proving it was purchased just a few weeks ago.  Hopefully we'll see a replacement, and hopefully it will last more than a few weeks or months.  My dad was really happy with it.  It was easy for him to program, it made decent coffee, and it kept it warm without compromising the flavor.  He never had any overflow problems.  From what we could tell, there is a hotplate, but it only comes on to warm the thermal pot at the beginning of the cycle.  Then it turns off.  Hopefully we'll be able to give the replacement unit a better review!

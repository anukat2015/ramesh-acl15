Title: Not worth it
Content:
As with other reviewers, I was interested in this product because of the positive reviews from others. I thought it would be convienent since I am the only one in the house who drinks coffee. I have only used it twice and I plan to return it. This coffee maker is very messy, spilling coffee grounds into the water resevoir and defiling my drink. The coffee is hot enough that the you nearly burn your hand if you touch the stainless steel cup, but unfortunately the coffee turns to a luke warm quickly. I would not recommend buying this product even if you are getting a good price.

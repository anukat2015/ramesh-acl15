Title: Great technology, but display isn't "pro"
Content:
When I pay between $1500-2000 for a 15.4" laptop, I usually expect to get an exceptional display, something that will do AT LEAST 1680x1050 resolution, and possibly even 1920x1080/1920x1200 (like my thinkpads).  The 15.4 MBP does 1440x900, which is simply subpar.  For professionals in music, video and gfx, that is not considered a "pro" resolution, it is considered a resolution for the masses that typically doesn't know the difference.  Its meant for those older folks who no longer care for high resolution displays, and want something they can see, in other words, HUGE icons and fonts.  This laptop isn't for them, but rather, this is for the PROFESSIONALS, as the name indicates.
Usually mac does a great job with the latest and greatest, but the display resolution is a huge let down.  Knowing mac, they intentionally scaled it down so that they could offer 1680x1050 in the next revision.  This is their typical M.O. with their ipods and appleTVs also.
I have a 17" as well, which does 1920x1200, and that is an awesome piece of equipment.  If you don't mind the extra price, weight and size, which is a considerable difference now I realize, get it.  The extra size and weight is well worth it in my opinion, and it will still be lighter than most PC laptops that are 15" displays.

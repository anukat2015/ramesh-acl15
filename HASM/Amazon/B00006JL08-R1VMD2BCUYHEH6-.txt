Title: Just OK
Content:
I bought this coffe maker 2 days ago and so far i am not impressed. The coffee tastes ok but is not kept hot enough. It also drips sometimes when you pause to get a cup during brewing. What really sold me were the water filter and the machine's sturdy construction. I really loved the black version, it looks so classy...too bad i had to get the white one to match my other appliances. So overall it is an OK machine but im my opinion too overpriced.

Title: Awesome Machine! Good customer service Great Coffee and Cappacino
Content:
This coffee maker looks Great! And Works Great!  I used the Espresso and the Coffee maker and i'm happy with both. I'm no coffee expert, but i brew only gourmet coffee through here and it works great. 
!!! I RECEIVED MY ITEM AND IT WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY !!! Called Customer service, and it turned out it was a defective part sent with the unit. They promptly sent me a replacement part at no charger. Works like a champ.

Title: Great!!
Content:
I've been looking for a light but powerful vacuum to use on my carpeted stairs. I'm a self-proclaimed weakling and I have no trouble carrying the canister up the stairs.  (My husband was getting tired of doing the stairs with our heavy vacuum!)  I have two dogs and we always have pet hair.  The pet hair attachment is awesome and picks up the hair with no problem - very powerful!  I'm definitely glad we bought this vacuum - so far, so good!

Title: Oil Odor is Sickening - literally!
Content:
The heater works well in that it warms the room, but the problem is the STRONG ODOR OF OIL which gives me a headache and makes me sick to my stomach. Evidently the radiator is NOT SEALED PROPERLY; if it were I wouldn't be smelling the fumes! 
A couple weeks later: I tried it again, and the smell of oil gradually decreased to zero after a few days of use if I used it on LOW setting, but whenever I tried the high setting it stank. 
The identical heater I had last year did not smell, but stopped working after less than a year. Are these supposed to be disposable?! I expected that if the oil was sealed inside that it should last a long time... Will see what happens with this one...
The manufacturer should warn you BEFORE you buy it that it will reek of fumes. I'm giving it the lowest rating due to the pollution factor and the health hazards. Sorry, I don't have a garage to pollute, and at any rate, it is still polluting the air. Silly me, I like clean air and environmentally sound products, and responsible manufacturers.

Title: Great, but not for long!
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker less than two years ago, and for the most part I loved it.  I did have a problem with ALL the markings wiping off (with just soap and water) within the first six months of use.  My problem NOW is...I feel for the amount of money I spent to have a trusted brand like Cuisinart...my coffeemaker should work.  As of today...it died!  It turns on, and thirty seconds later it beeps...NO COFFEE!  Will be writing Cuisinart...

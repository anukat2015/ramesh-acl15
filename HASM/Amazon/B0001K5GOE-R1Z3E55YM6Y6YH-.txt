Title: Amazing
Content:
Like many, I debated in my head about spending $500 for a vacuum, but I convinced myself that a Dyson would motivate me to vacuum my floors much more frequently.  It works wonderfully as advertised, and on top of that, it is beautifully designed.  I often leave it out just to admire the compact design.  My 6-year old stepson sat and played with it for an hour after bringing it home.  Form really does follow function with this Dyson.

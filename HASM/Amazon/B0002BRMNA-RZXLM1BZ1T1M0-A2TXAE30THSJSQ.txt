Title: Excellent product!
Content:
Regardless of the Ipud lovers who trash this unit, the truth is it is an excellent product. I have had mine for 6 months now and have had NO problems whatsoever! I've used half the space on the drive and have over 4500 songs on it! Two things keep this from being 5 stars. One is that the case belt clip is plastic and does not hold to your belt too well (which isn't a big deal, I keep the Nomad in my pocket- the beeper style spring type would be better) and that in order to keep all your albums in alphabetical order by artist you have to rename each song's album title "Artist-Title of album." An easy way to collect songs from various years (I like to have collections of hits grouped by year) is to just rename the album title of the song by the year of release. Viola! Albums arranged by year. Want to hear hits from 1957? Select the album! Songs form 1985? select the album! This is just fantastic!!! Highly recommended! Oh, and the earbuds do sound great!

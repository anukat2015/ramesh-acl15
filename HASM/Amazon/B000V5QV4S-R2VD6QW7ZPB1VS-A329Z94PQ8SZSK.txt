Title: Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera
Content:
The Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR is such an excellent advanced camera that I'm finding it difficult to express my feeling in ordinary language. I previously owned the 20D for about a year which I thought was excellent, then upgraded to the 30D which simply blew me away, and now a year and a half later I've splurged on the 40D - which has left me speechless! I can't imagine what the successor to this 40D can possibly improve upon - but I'm going to have to be satisfied with this one for a long time to come. My first SLR was an all-manual Contax D (1956) which still works BTW, then the Canon AE-1 (1973), and some digital point and shoots prior to the 20D. Given this perspective, I can only say that the 40D is truly an amazing piece of equipment. There's just nothing wrong, other than a rather extensive learning curve on how to use it properly.

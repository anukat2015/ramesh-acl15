Title: Small but mighty
Content:
I like the fact that this vacuum is small and light but it has incredible suction and a long cord and hose. It makes vacuuming almost fun. It works great - I've used it to vacuum my whole house - Berber carpet and linoleum - and to vacuum my car. It works great everywhere. I even vacuumed my front porch because of all the leaves that fell off my fern. 
I got rid of my large heavy upright with the short hose that gave me a huge backache every time I used it. 
The price was super too. I love buying from Amazon because of these reviews. It helps me to know whether I want to buy a product or not.

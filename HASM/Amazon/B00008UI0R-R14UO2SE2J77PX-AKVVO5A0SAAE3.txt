Title: Great product
Content:
Having used canister vacs for years while I was living with my mother, I vowed that I would never own one.  My mother's was clumsy and heavy.  Now that I am in a house with tile floors, I decided to give this vacuum a try.  It is wonderful: lightweight, easy to use and great performance.  All for a low price.  I would highly recommend this vacuum.

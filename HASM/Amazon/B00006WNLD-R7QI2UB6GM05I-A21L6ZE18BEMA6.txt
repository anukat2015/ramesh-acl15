Title: JUNK design
Content:
While sounding like a good idea, terrible engineering skills were applied. A cup here means a TINY cup. What's the point if I can't even use a coffee mug? The area to pour the water in is also narrow, and you wind up splashing some into the coffee container that is right next to it all the time. To top it off, apparently the thing doesn't seal well and the coffee grounds wind up bubbling into the water container so that the latter is always dirty. BAD.

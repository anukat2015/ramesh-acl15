Title: Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew, Brushed Chrome Coffee Maker
Content:
Coffee Maker works well except for 3 dumb annoyances:
a.) The grinder spins too long even if it is set at 4 cups capacity. Grinder spins beyond 15 seconds after all the coffee grind has emptied into the drip holder. Did the manufacturer ever tested their own machine?
b.) There is no light indicating if the keep warm feature is still on or not.
c.) Carafe's cover lets the coffee pour out so slowly that my grass grows faster than filling a cup of coffee.

Title: Nice for the Money
Content:
The Zune is a trusty player that is well organized and offers radio, where iPods do not. The button navigation is not as sleek as an iPod, but still functional. The install of the Zune is probably the worst thing about it. There are about ten different things that can go wrong. For instance, sometimes updated versions of WMP interfere. For me, I had a password on my administrator account that I was unaware of. I had to hack into my own computer to remove the password so that the Zune could access the My Music folder for all users. Anyway, the Zune is pretty, it holds music and video, so there you go. It's targeted to a young, hip crowd, but don't let that put you off. It's a nice player. Even my iPod devoted boyfriend was excitedly playing with it when it arrived. A few notes of caution: If you have an iPod and have downloaded music from the store, chances are you're going to have a hard time transitioning to a Zune. Also, when you first get your Zune, change the rip settings to .mp3. The default is .wma, which can't be read on many other players.

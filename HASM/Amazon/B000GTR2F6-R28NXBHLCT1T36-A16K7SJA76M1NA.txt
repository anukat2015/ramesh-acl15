Title: End Product Is Great, Hardware Not So Much
Content:
My wife purchased the B60 model for our home in December of '09. After 2 months of use it stopped working as it was designed - pump failure. I returned it and decided to upgrade to the B70 model. After only three days of use the B70 began having the same issues as the B60, the pump would run for about 2 minutes and the unit would shutoff. 
Again, I returned the brewer and replaced it with another B70 unit. For roughly two weeks our third brewer worked flawlessly. Now, we're returning it for a fourth. Same issue...pump runs for a couple of minutes and then shuts off.
I rated the B70 with 2 stars. If the end product, the coffee, wasn't such high quality I would have rated the B70 a 1 star. If you're in the market for a Keurig brewer I would wait until they redesign the pump before making your purchase. Too much money to buy K-cups and never get to use them and enjoy a nice cup of Joe. 
Footnote: we always use filtered water in our brewers as Keurig suggests.

Title: A great choice!
Content:
This is a great computer! My previous laptop was a 2003 Gateway that lasted me through the end of high school, all through college, and the beginning of graduate school. In fact, it still works pretty well, although it has a tendency of shutting off when overheated and/or when the power cord shifts slightly. So, given my relationship with the Gateway, I was reluctant to get a new computer. However, when my computer-savvy partner purchased this laptop as a gift for me this holiday season (he was more frustrated by my prehistoric computer than me), I found that the update was a wonderful change. I'm still getting used to the keyboard and touchpad, but this is likely because I'm used to the old keyboard (very chunky and close-together keys and a recessed touchpad). The screen resolution is clear and wonderful. Windows 7 has so many excellent features (especially in comparison to XP), that I'm still finding new things to do. The sound is excellent as well. I am not a fan of the special features of the touchpad (such as the ability to "pinch" with it), so I turned that feature off (I was accidentally minimizing screens and moving things around without intending to). I have also found that the built-in microphone does not offer the best quality sound. Other than that, I highly recommend this computer -- especially for those who, like me, are hesitant to "upgrade."

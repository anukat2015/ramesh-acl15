Title: Waste of money
Content:
Pros:  Progammable feature works.  Can make good coffee when making 6-8 cups. 
 
Cons: Making fewer than 6 cups of coffee results in coffee that's just not as good - even when using the "1-4" feature or using more coffee grounds.   
Cannot make more than 8 cups of coffee because the basket won't hold more than 8 scoops of coffee grounds.   
I got this for Christmas last year and by September, it wouldn't work any more and I had to get a replacement from Cuisinart.  
It's messy - the hole for getting water into the reservoir is small, and you have to use a measuring cup or other vessel because there is no coffee pot. 
Contrary to claims, the longer the coffee sits brewed on the heater, it does start to take on that burned diner-coffee flavor.  It just takes a little longer to get that burned flavor.

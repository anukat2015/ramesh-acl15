Title: great camera
Content:
This combination of camera and lens is very, very good.  Having had a few Nikon film SLR's and lenses,  I can appreciate the quality of this set.  The lens is pretty sharp and covers most of what you need. The camera has many, many functions and options to take just about any picture you need.  And, the resulting photos are fabulous.  I took a great photo still life of a Corona beer bottle and the photo gave the glass a wonderful visual quality almost like a soap bubble.  Capturing that kind of delicate detail is difficult. I wish I could have the D700 with full FX sensor, but the D90 is certainly no poor substitute.  I love it.

Title: Super mid-entry level DSLR
Content:
This was my 1st DSLR and I'm pretty pleased with it so far.  It feels pretty comforable in my hand.  I primarily use it for outdoor sports photography.  I'm still figuring out my way around it but I will grow into this eventually.  This was the best body I could get within my price range and it will be more than enough for a weekend shooter.

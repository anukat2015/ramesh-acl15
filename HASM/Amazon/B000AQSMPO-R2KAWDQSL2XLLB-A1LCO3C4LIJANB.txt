Title: very easy to use
Content:
My wife and I use this all the time, since we have different tastes in coffee. And for guests who drink decaf, it's perfect to brew them one cup, instead of brewing a whole pot just for them.
The only drawback is that the coffee cups you have to use with this product are very expensive. If you're a heavy coffee drinker like me, plan on spending more then twice the amount you would brewing pots.

Title: Coffee Maker vs. Farmer every 5:00 A.M.
Content:
Every morning I look forward to a good cup of coffee.  Since I bought the reconditioned Keurig B60 I get a great cup of coffee but one which is served by a neurotic old friend.. I often wonder if this morning the brewing temperature will change from 192 to 112 degrees or if the digital time will be true or five hours earlier or if I choose a small cup my old friend serves me an overflowing large cup.  If I exchange this coffee maker for one that has no flaws I will not be happy because I would miss all those digital quirks in the mornings.

Title: Worst coffee maker I have bought
Content:
I bought this unit to replace the old under counter design. I have limited space in my kitchen so this style is my best choice. The old models were laden with problems that I was able to modify and overcome.  This unit though nicely styled will only heat the coffee to 165º.  After 20 minutes the coffee is 145º.  It is also so weak that I need to double the amount of coffee I use.  This is unacceptable.  When I called B & D they said that it is way it was designed.  Thank the lady that sued McDonalds for spilling her hot coffee and now everybody must suffer.  I don't know if Amazon will take it back, but I will never buy a Black & Decker product again.

Title: shipping taking forever?
Content:
I know a lot of you are annoyed with Amazon for not shipping the ZEN Vision:M out ASAP. Trust me, I'm annoyed too. However, I ordered mine from Academic Superstore in mid-March. I don't have mine either and it's not Amazon or Academic Superstore's fault. You can't even get them on the Creative website. It's gone....everywhere. The manufacturer keeps pushing back the shipping dates. So settle down, I know it's taking forever (I feel your pain) but they are coming....slowly but surely.

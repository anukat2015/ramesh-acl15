Title: Superb Core Qualities With A Few Annoying Quirks
Content:
I just got the unit today and so far I have to say I'm impressed. This thing sucks like a son-of-a-gun. And, after all, at the end of the day, isn't that what a vacuum cleaner is all about? I know from others that this thing will be sucking just as powerfully five years from now as today. And for me, that's what seals the deal. I've been thru three Kenmore canisters in the past 15 or so years and they all lose suction after a few months. Here's a quick run-down of my initial impressions...
Pro's:
*Really pretty unit...very high tech
*Suction that will put all other vacs to shame...and it's going to stay that way over time
*Very easy to empty
*Never have to worry about having a spare bag
*Lifetime filter that you just have to rinse out every three months or so
*Effective tool storage right on the unit
*Very ingenous telescoping wand...easy to adjust
*Great cord retraction
Cons:
*An "instuction manual" from hell...ridiculously inadequate pictures only...no text...UTTERLY WORTHLESS
*Awkward hose attachment to the front of the unit...pulling the canister around makes you feel like you might damage the      connection
*Very awkward control to turn the tubine head on and off...you have to bend down and yank a red disk in and out
*I would have preferred a separate floor head in addition to the turbine head
*The turbine head is terrific on some carpets but can become "suck" on others making it hard to push
*There is no way to effectively wrap the hose around this little unit so you have to put it away completely 'unfurled'
*I would have preferred the on/off switch to be on the hand grip rather than a button you have to press with your foot
So, while the unit is not an ergonomic delight it does excel at what it's ultimately designed to do - suck. And it's nice knowing this comes with a complete five year warranty. Were it not for a few of the nit-picky ergonomic oddities, I would have given this a solid 5 stars.

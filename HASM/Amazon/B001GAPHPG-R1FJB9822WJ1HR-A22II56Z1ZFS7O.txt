Title: A Great Buy
Content:
I upgraded from the K10D to the K2000. Some would think this is a downgrade. It just ain't so. I needed ISO 3200 for my work as a newspaper reporter and photojournalism, but simply didn't have the serious money for the high end cameras. With a prime lens and a little post processing, I get very nice (sometimes outstanding) low light shots that get published. Focus speed is way faster that the K10D in all situations. The camera is small and light, and very user friendly. There are many in-camera options for creating the kind of picture you enjoy. I have used similar (and higher) level Canons and Nikons and for the money this camera can't be beat.

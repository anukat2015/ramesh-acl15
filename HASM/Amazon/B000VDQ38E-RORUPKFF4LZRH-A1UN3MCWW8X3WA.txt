Title: Not as good as I was hoping for....
Content:
We have a German Shepherd mix, so I thought the Pet Hair eraser was the way to go. It does all right (nothing special). I don't think its better than any other vacuum though. Its loud, the beater bar doesn't stop turning so I can't use it on the hardwood floors, and its top heavy. Also every time I empty the container I have to re-vacuum. Its very messy.
The attachments are nice, and like I said, it does the job.
Wouldn't recommend to a friend, or re-buy this product for pet hair issues.

Title: better than expected!
Content:
this little green monster eats up way more than i ever anticipated when i brought him home. its far exceeded expectations, especially for a cordless. nothing bad to say about the vac at all. however, i agree with the other reviewer(s) in regard to the lack of a stand/mount. kinda foolish the way it just sits there flopped on its side because the input for the power source is on the bottom of the unit. what were they thinking not including a mount/stand? doesnt take away fromt he functionality of the machine though! get urself one of these immediately! 
and euro-pro, get us all a proper stand, would you?

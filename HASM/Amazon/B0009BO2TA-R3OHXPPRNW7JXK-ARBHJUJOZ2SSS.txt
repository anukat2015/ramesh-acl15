Title: A disappointing lightweight vac with a short lifespan
Content:
Pro: Lightweight; cool design; plenty of cord for small rooms; convenient features like a retractable cord; swivel head makes it easy to reach underneath things.
Con: Cheap construction shows; the main attachment is held together only by pressing the tubes together, not by any sort of locking mechanism, so it frequntly comes unattached while in use; brush and crevice tools are too small to be of any use; cord retracter is fragile, and once it goes there is no way to repair it; there is, in fact, no way to repair anything on this, and it's too flimsy for that not to become an issue in a year or so.  
I bought this vacuum because it was small enough to fit our closet and had the design sensibility of more expensive products like the Meile but cost about 75% less.  We had to use the attachments from our old vacuum because the ones that came with this model were useless, and my wife refused to use it because the pieces keep coming detached mid-job. But I persevered by holding things together with one hand while I used the other to manuever the vacuum, and for light cleaning around our apartment it worked fine for about a year.  Then the cord started having troubles moving in and out of the machine, and it finally went off the track entirely.  Because the body is just plastic snapped together, there is no way to get inside and set the cord right, so the machine is done for.  Next time I'll bite the bullet and get a quality product to begin with--even for our light use, this just didn't cut it.

Title: Great product!
Content:
I am a college student living in Milwaukee and don't want to pay outrageous costs for heating my floor of a house.  My room is pretty small (about 9x10 ft) and figured that a space heater was the best way to heat my little room without spending too much money.
Like others have said, this has no fan, and because of this it makes absolutely no noise.  If it weren't for the lights of the lamps, it would be hard to remember if it were on or off.
Even at a low setting (only 400 watts) it puts off good heat.  It sits on my desk about three feet away from me and I have to point it away from my face as it feels it is going to melt off.  
The only downfall (which is not really a downfall, as it comes with a radiant heater) is that it needs to be pointed at you in order to heat you.  Since my room is pretty small, it actually does heat my room enough to be able to live in it.
Basically, if you need this heater just for you and don't mind it being relatively close to you, it is a great heater.  It will heat a small room, but don't expect it to take it from 50 degrees to 75 degrees.  It will not heat a large room!
Overall, I would definitely buy it again as it is very energy efficient and fits me just perfectly!

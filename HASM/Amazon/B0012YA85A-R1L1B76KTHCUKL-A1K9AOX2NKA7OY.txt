Title: Almost usable
Content:
I had high hopes for this product. Something I could finally afford and use to improve my limited skill set. But the first 3 pictures I took were completely out of focus using AF. When compared to my Kodak shot of the same scene, they were a dismal failure. This camera has a problem so back it goes.

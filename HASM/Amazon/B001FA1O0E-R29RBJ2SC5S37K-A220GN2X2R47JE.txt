Title: Amazing Device! So much fun!
Content:
With the iPod I find myself interested in so many things, I never thought I would be... it really opened the doors to podcasts, apps, music, video, games, mobile web browsing and so much. It's very convenient, I wished there was an option to upgrade to satellite internet just in case I ever get lost while driving I could find my way... this is the only thing bad about it, that your only choice of internet connection is WiFi... other than that it's so convenient and fun.

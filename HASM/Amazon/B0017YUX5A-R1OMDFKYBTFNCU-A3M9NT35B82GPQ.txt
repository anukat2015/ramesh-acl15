Title: Pros and cons....
Content:
I purchased a Hoover carpet shampooer recently, and was very pleased with performance and quality, so naturally I looked at Hoover's line of vacuums. The price for the canister was a bit much, I thought---but I liked the idea of the freedom it offered, having had uprights for the last 10 years. My first impression was that the quality of the plastic wasn't there, so only 3 stars--for example, if you open the top to reveal the two small attachments (the other two: floor/brush and upholstery won't fit anywhere), the lid seems like it wouldn't take much pressure to accidently snap it off. Also, when it arrived, the plastic window covering wasn't attached--no problem, it snapped right in---but it left me with an unsettled feeling about my purchase. The good news is that it's pretty easy to roll, the handle is adjustable, and for the first time in ages I can actually vacuum under my bed :) I also like the way the canister secures the handle; it doesn't take much more room than the upright. The suction is good, as I haven't seen my carpet's nap in a while; it's around 5 years old. Overall, I think if it were priced a little less or the plastic was more durable, I'd feel better...but with both Hoover products, my carpet is looking more like its old 'new' self.

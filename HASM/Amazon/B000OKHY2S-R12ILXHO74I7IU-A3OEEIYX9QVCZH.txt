Title: Pretty good.
Content:
I bought 3 of these and they work well on non humid days. They are easy to operate and stay filled for a good length of time. But if you are looking to stay really cool this is not for you. It keeps one room at a good temp. but you will never reach 75* if it is 90*- 105* outside, you maybe will reach 78*-80*.

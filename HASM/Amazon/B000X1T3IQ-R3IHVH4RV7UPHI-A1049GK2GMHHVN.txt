Title: Bulk Vs. Quality
Content:
After a lot of research and considering the 40d and the d300, who claim to perform a little better (?), this camera has something they don't have: Image Stabilization! This means lighter and smaller lenses. And if you add the excelent quality of Zuiko lenses, you got a winner by far. Just think about carrying canon's and nikon's huge, fancy and heavy lenses (if you want Image Stabilization) around in a trip, on long walks, and you'll know what I mean. If you want to get great shots and still enjoy your ride, this is the gear. 
Playing with the buttons and the menus is just a matter of getting used to, and taking shots with iso over 800 is not a daily thing.
All in all, outstanding quality, lighter gear and top of the notch optics, makes this camera the one to beat!

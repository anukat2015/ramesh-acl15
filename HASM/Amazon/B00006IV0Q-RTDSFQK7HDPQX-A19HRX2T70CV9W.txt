Title: So far so good.
Content:
We probably drink way too much coffee in our household.  We have used all different brands of Mr. Coffee-type makers and found them woefully lacking in durability and in producing good coffee.  We remembered back to the "old days" when percolators were the gold standard of coffee makers and we decided to give one a try.  The Presto coffee maker has produced great coffee for us and we are quite satisfied.  It's too soon to tell about durability but if it holds up, it is a good one.  There are no "bells and whistles" to it but we hope that will, in fact, increase its chances for good durability.  We recommend it strongly
It's two years later and we are still using the same coffee maker.  It just keeps on going and is great.  It has been a good value for the money.  We now use it to make coffee in the morning and then, we use it to heat water in the evening for tea.  We now recommend it without reservation.

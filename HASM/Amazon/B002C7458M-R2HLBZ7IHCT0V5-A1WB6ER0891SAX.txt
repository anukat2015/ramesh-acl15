Title: Don't be a sucker!
Content:
I have both PC's and Macs.  I have always loved my mac's.  But buying this laptop was a mistake.  I would like to think it was just one lemon, but my daughter bought one about a year ago and it has been taken in for service a couple times and it makes horrible noises that the apple repair person can't seem to hear.  My MacBook Pro is just falling apart.  It has never worked right always freezing up, way to hot and battery's going bad.  The beautiful exterior is coming off.  I don't know what happened to apple.  My daughter had a 13" apple laptop that was great for years.  We had a couple imac's over the years with no problems.   I am now looking for a desktop and would like to trust Apple products but for the $$$ I am going to go PC.  My husband and other daughter both have HP laptops and they are so much better in every way (like they work) than the MacBook Pro.  I was alway's backing Apple when it came to what computers to buy in our family, sorry to say there will be no arguement from me.

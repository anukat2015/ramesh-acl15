Title: PANASONIC CG885 CANISTER VACUUM CLEANER
Content:
AWESOME!  I have a Toy American Eskimo (long white hair) and a RED area rug in my living room.  My upright would not get up the hair. I used masking tape to clean the rug!   I did lots of research on vacuums and found the canisters were the most powerful. It was confusing because some had "dog hair attachments, etc.)  After reading about this vacuum, I decided it was what I wanted.  The day I received this vacuum, I put it together (simple) and went straight to the red rug.  I started vacuuming and it came right up - clean as a whistle (whatever that means).  After that I realized I had the setting on "med pile"...WOW.  I like that the off control, switch from Carpet to Floor is on the handle.  The control to adjust just from "xlow", Low, "Med" ,and "high" pile carpet is clearly marked and easy to adjust on with your foot on the sweeper part.  It DOES pull..it will take off with you if you do not have the height adjustment right!  The hose is long enough and the cord is xtra long - and automatically rewinds with a touch of the button.  Sweeper hooks on back of the canister for convenient storage. The bag could be larger, I read that it actually held as much as most - and because of the design would continue picking up effectively even when it "looked" full.  Haven't had to test that yet.  I LOVE IT !!  I took my old upright to a charity store.

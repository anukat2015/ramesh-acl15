Title: Great for Dust, Not Good for Anything Else
Content:
I've owned this for 3 months now. The pros--it is excellent at picking up dust. I have a child who is extremely allergic to dust and I've tried many vaccuums--this is the best for dust--the suction is really fantastic. The cons-- it does a mediocre job at anything except dust (e.g. bits of paper, cereal,crumbs). It frequently jams and needs to be unjammed. The cord is too short and it is awkward to balance on a stair when cleaning the staircase. It doesn't roll or operate smoothly--it frequently gets tangled in its own cord.
For my needs it works--the dust pickup is great. But unless you are hypersensitive to dust, this probably isn't worth the money or aggravation.

Title: Great Laptop for the Money!
Content:
I ordered this laptop about a month ago and have been very impressed with both the performance and the look/feel of the notebook.  This is my first ASUS after bailing off of the HP bandwagon for the last few years.  The slim design and light weight package are very attractive.  The keyboard gives a nice resistance when typing (almost as if it has some kind of magical 'type-assist'#....as well as plenty of space between the keys.  The other comments regarding resolution are somewhat right, depending on what you're doing with it.  The Video Magic software from ASUS allows for enhancement for videos, and I've been impressed with the output.  The only disappointment would be if you do a lot of work in PS CS4...the resolution isn't the best for fine-tuning high-res photos.  Not really a big deal.
The only other downside is that my webcam is upside down.  Jeers to ASUS for not yet addressing this problem with this model on their website.  I used a 3rd Party workaround and it seems to work now #in most cases#.
Otherwise, great speed....loaded CS4 in under 30 minutes and it boots Photoshop CS4 in under 10 seconds, twice as fast as my duo core HP.
Overall, for the price, this laptop is hands-down a GREAT value.

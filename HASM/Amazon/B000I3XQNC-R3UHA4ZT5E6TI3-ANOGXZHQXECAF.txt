Title: Canon Rocks!
Content:
I am now using this camera for almost 2 months. Its been a great experience working with this camera. The 18-55 mm wide angle lens itself has capture brilliant photos whether it is night or day. I also have the Canon 100-400mm IS Telephote lens which I used to take the far images is the exact match for this mate. I have been highly overwhelmed to work with this.

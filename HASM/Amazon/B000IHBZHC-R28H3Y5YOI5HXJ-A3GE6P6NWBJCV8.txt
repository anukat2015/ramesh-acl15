Title: Creative Zen W 60 GB
Content:
Creative Zen Vision W 60 GB Widescreen Multimedia Player (Black)I recieved this for my birthday almost 1 year ago. After sending the first one back, it locked up. I recieved a new one right away. The Zen Vision W is used 3 to 4 times a week, mostly watching movies. It works great, easy to use software, easy to load or delete. The picture is very good, much better than Ipod, which some other people have. I take care of it , but it is in a rough environment (work) and I haven't had any problems. Just ordered a heavy duty leather case, and JBL speakers. When we have standby time on the job, people like to share the videos.

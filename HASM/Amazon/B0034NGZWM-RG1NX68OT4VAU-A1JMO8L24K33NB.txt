Title: the one to get fore gaming
Content:
Asus is the number 1 selling laptop now and for a good reason.  They are not just affordable but reliable.  I have owned mine several months and have not had a single crash.  The graphics for games are smooth and the colors are vivid.   My only real criticism is that the number pad is awkward because it overlaps the arrows you use to move around so I mistype now and then which is annoying.   Otherwise, a great lap top and highly recommended.

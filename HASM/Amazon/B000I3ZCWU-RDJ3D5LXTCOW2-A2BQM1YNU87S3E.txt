Title: Fabulous Upgrade
Content:
Please see the previous review for the details, but as a former XT owner, I can say the XTi is a real step up.... not so much in terms of image quality, but user interface. Changing all the settings - ISO, metering, autofocus, etc. - has been greatly improved. And the new display make it easy to see what all the current settings are - no more shooting all day outside at ISO 1600 because you forgot to check the menu option. Overall, the XTi makes it easier to be a good photographer than the XT. And that's certainly worth a little extra money to me.

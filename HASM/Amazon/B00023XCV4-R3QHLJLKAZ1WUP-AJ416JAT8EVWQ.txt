Title: Honeymoon is over
Content:
After just 4 months of minimal use (Monday mornings only), our attractive Hamilton Beach 12 cup suddenly quit.  I should have listened.  It produces only weak, warm clear coffee as of yesterday. 
Irreconcilable differences. The required $9.95 shipping to return to the manufacturer is an insult.  Good bye Hamilton Beach

Title: Excellent product!
Content:
I do not have a single complaint with this coffee maker. The coffee taste is excellent and is always very hot coffee. It is easy to program and even offers a choice of 1-4 hours of "stay-on" time. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found that installing the water filter could not have been simpler. It is tall as some mentioned, but I cannot imagine not having to pull out any coffee pot from under a cabinet if that is it's location. The opening to the water tank is plenty large enough to pour into easily. I have had no dripping when pouring. It also looks great! Would definitley recommend.

Title: My only complaint is that I didn't buy two,
Content:
I'm getting another one, I love this sucker so much.
Energy efficient at 400 and 800 watts vs 1500 for a convection heater.
In short, if you:
1) stay pretty much in one spot during the day
2) have high ceilings or your home is really hard to heat
3) have dust allergies
4) use a heater just during your waking hours and pile on the warm blankets at night
5) are not bothered by some light being emitted from your heater
6) have cats or dogs
7) love how it feels when the sun warms up your clothes and skin
8) are concerned about energy efficiency
9) need a heater that won't burn anyone who bumps into it
then this is the space heater for you!

Title: Stay away from dell.
Content:
I have purchased a number of dell products over the past few years.  Quality has fallen and more importantly both the technical service and customer service has become virtually worthless.  I have had problems with two of the last three dell computers I purchased.  The current inspiron i bought makes a very bad noise when the hard drive spins.  I have tried to get this resolved using the technical support line.  To get to a dell technician you have to try to work through a phone message tree that requires you to enter 12 digit service tags, which the phone system cannot understand.  After a few minutes of useless attempts, the system places you in a queue.  This time it took me about 20 minutes of waiting to talk to the first technician.  While on hold, a recorded message trys to sell you an upgraded protection plan at additional cost that gives you speedier access to support from someone who in North America!  After getting a hold of the first technician who takes some minimal information you get placed on hold again.  It has been about 45 min and I am still on hold.  dell used to have good customer support.   These days computer makers are using components from the same vendors.  What you need to consider is the customer service.  Still don't know what is wrong with this hard drive, but mostly I waiting to get a hold of someone to do a return for refund.  If you are thinking of buying a dell, try calling the support line before you buy.  See how long you have to wait.  These days, computers are computers.

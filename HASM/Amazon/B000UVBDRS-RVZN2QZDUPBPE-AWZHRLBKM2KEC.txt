Title: My Zen
Content:
As a total MP3 player junkie I can ernestly say that I love my Zen. But! There is a but. We have issues. I read a bunch of reviews before buying this product telling how it died right after people bought it. Mines blacked out, but a simple reset and it was back to working. The problem with this is that it blacked out the 1st day i got it. It blacks our most of the time during syncing and I get fustrated with reseting it. It is other than that a very good player. The features are east to figure out and you can even add pics as ur background to personalize it. Syncing is easy. Theres no complicated software. Its a good alternative to an ipod. The battery life doesn't seem to be as long as it promises. It allows you delete tracks from the player without hooking it up.

Title: Love it
Content:
I love this camera. After consulting various friends with different Canons and other digital SLRs, I decided not to go top-of-the-line for the body and use the difference in price to buy an extra lens. After all, as one of my friends put it "the lenses last forever, the bodies don't". The extra features on the XSi are overkill for the average photographer, I think, and this camera takes lovely photos and is easy to use. Another lens with a bigger zoom is really a must, but the 18-55mm lens is a nice general purpose lens.

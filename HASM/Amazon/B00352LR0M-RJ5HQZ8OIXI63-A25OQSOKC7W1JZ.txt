Title: Let me clear the confusion...
Content:
ASUS N71JQ-X1 17.3-Inch Versatile Entertainment Laptop (Dark Brown)
The reviews prior to this one say what a great laptop this is but that it lacked a Blu-Ray player.  The description must have been off when most people first ordered this, and I would be upset if I had thought I was getting blu-ray player, but didn't.  That being said, and I knew what I was getting.  Let me be clear; this is an AMAZING value for what you're getting...even without Blu-Ray.  Think about it; you're getting an Intel Core i7 laptop, with a 1GB ATI discrete graphics card, 17 inch, high def screen, and a 500GB hard-drive...oh and 4GB of Kingston RAM...all for under $1200 (as of this writing)?  Are you kidding me?  
I love this laptop, and I was a lifelong HP guy, until my screen died after 2 years of use...the build quality on this is incredible, the screen is beautiful, and as for Blu-Ray...meh.  Everything's going disc-less digital anyway.  A few years from now, and everything will be download only anyway.
Don't let the other reviews fool you, this is THE value in laptops, from one of the most well-decorated manufacturers of the last few years.  Check out some sites on the net, do your research, and I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion I did...this is the laptop to own.
Good luck and happy hunting.
ADDITIONAL INFO (Posted 3/22/2010) after using this laptop for the past few days, I can safely say that this was a great bargain.  It's faster and more responsive than my previous HP that cost 3x as much.  Also, it came with DDR3 1333 RAM instead of the advertised 1066.  Nice little bonus.  Point being, if you buy this laptop, I doubt you'd ever regret it.

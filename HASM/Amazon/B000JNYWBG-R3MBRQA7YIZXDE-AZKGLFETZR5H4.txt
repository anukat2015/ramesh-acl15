Title: If you like music and 'gadgety' stuff on a single device, don't hesitate!
Content:
At first I wasn't sure about buying it, then I wasn't sure if going for the 8gb or the 16gb iPod touch. I ended up buying the 16gb and I couldn't be happier.
I don't use it that often, but when I do it does match up to my expectations. The web browser is really cool, the video player quality is the best, the photos look really really good and the timers, alarms, and the youtube dedicated application are very nice.
The main things I use it for are when I go jogging or when I'm in my car and it does the work like no other devide on the market.
The touch interfase is very cool and very intuitive, you don't have to struggle with the iPod to get to do something, it kinda reads your mind, everything is easy and quick!
So if music, wi-fi, videos, photos is what you want...go for it!
Oh, I finally bought the 16gb because my music folder is 10gb so I didn't want to select "the songs that I want on my iPod" I just clicked on "send all my music to my ipod" and there it is!
All the songs I like in there!!!
And it really is thin as a pencil!! Looks really cool and I would to comment again on the unmatchable touch screen! really cool!

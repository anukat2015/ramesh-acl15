Title: Beware
Content:
I bought this sweeper 6 months ago.  At first, the sweeper was amazing.  I couldn't believe how well it worked.  Now, the brush won't spin.  I have burber carpet and have to set the height to "shag" to get the brush to spin...so...I'm off to the service center 40 miles away and I am really hoping Bissell will stand behind it's products.  I really should have spent the extra $150-200 for a Dyson.  I would never recommend this sweeper to anyone.

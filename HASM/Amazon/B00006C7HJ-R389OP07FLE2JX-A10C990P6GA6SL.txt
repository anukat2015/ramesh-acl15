Title: Vornado Heaters in Yachts
Content:
Being a yacht captain, we need heat in various areas of the boat such as in engine rooms and bilge compartments.  This heater will turn off if it falls over.  Air circulation is critical to prevent mildew and condensation.  The heater air flow design is perfect.  I have about 12 of these heaters on other yachts I take care of.  Also, the Vornado fans are on the yachts as well.

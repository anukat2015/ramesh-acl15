Title: Love it!
Content:
I bought it for the gym. Its perfect, nice and small. (I used to strap the 30gig video to my arm.) I just put my workout playlist on it. It has on/off, shuffle, skip, pause, volume, and I love the built on clip perfect for attatching it to the end of you shirt or sleeve. Totally worth the money!

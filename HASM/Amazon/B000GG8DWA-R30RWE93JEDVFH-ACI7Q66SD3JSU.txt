Title: Small but nice
Content:
The small Quartz heater is perfect for taking the edge off of a small cold room like an office or small bedroom.  Especially useful if you like a cool and spouse likes it hot... put it in front of the person who prefers to be warmer.  It is easy to move around since it has a plastic handgrip rather than a metal loop (which can burn).  It is not meant for heating large spaces.  Love that there is no blower (why put blowers on quartz...makes no sense!).  Still screw up when trying to figure out which position the knob is indicating.

Title: Great Coffee
Content:
If you like fresh ground coffee without the hassle of grinding and then transfering the coffee, just put the water, beans, and pot in the thing and have coffee when you want, either now or program the time.
We use the filter that comes with it (first time to do this) and it works great.
We like strong coffee, so we use french roast, and it is good.

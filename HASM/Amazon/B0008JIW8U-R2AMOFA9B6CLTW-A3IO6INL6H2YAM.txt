Title: Dribble Pot
Content:
The coffee maker itself works fine. Brews pretty quick.  BUT!!!!   The damn "decanter", pot, whatever... DRIBBLES  every time you pour!!!  When i fill the back with the decanter- it dribbles water all over the counter.  When i pour out the first 2 cups of coffee- it dribbles coffee all over the counter. It's doubled my paper towel consumption!!!  Tried everything- lifting the lid to pour, pouring slowly, pouring quickly etc.  Haven't tried running it over with the car yet.

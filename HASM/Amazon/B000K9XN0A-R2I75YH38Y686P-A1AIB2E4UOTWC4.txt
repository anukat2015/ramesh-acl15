Title: Fine - if you drink your coffee immediately
Content:
My wife and I drink a lot of coffee throughout the day. We got this product hoping that it would keep coffee reasonably warm for long periods of time. The problem is, the moment it comes out of the brewer it's barely hot. If you set your cup down for 5 minutes, it'll be tepid. After 10 minutes, it's cold.  We've decided to keep our old one and just bought a simple carafe to pour the coffee into to keep warm. So far, it seems to be a process that works for us until we find something better. 
Also, there were several instances where coffee grounds overflowed from the basket into the carafe, as well a couple of instances where it made a mess all over the counter. The latter I chalked up to user error where we probably didn't have the door closed enough...maybe. 
In summary, this coffee maker is tolerable, but it has its problems. If you get a good one and drink you're coffee immediately after pouring it, you might be happy with this unit.

Title: Good A/C Unit
Content:
I've used this A/C unit for 3 years.  Other reviewers complain that it trips the circuit breaker.  It's never done to me ever.  Never tripped it's own built in circuit breaker, never tripped the building's breaker.  I'll turn it on at 8am and off at 7pm when the cool breese starts and it runs just fine.  As for removing water, there is a little hose you hook up to the a/c unit and run it inside the white 4" exhaust hose.  The water is blown out the window - It's totally automatic.  There's no need to empty the unit manually.  Never had a leak.  
The exhaust hose does get hot and radiates heat into the room, so I got some insulation designed for a hose from Home Depot.  Heat is retained in the hose and blown out the window.  
Noise - it does get noisy and when talking on the phone your friends know when the A/C is on.  But, I can watch TV with it on, just turn up the volume.
The window bracket cracked by the hole where the hose plugs in.  1/4" wooden dowel and hot melt glue gun to the rescue!  Glued dowel to both sides of the hole, Now it's stronger than stock.

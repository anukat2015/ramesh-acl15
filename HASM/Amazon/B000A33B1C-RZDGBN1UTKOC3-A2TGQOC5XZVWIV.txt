Title: Good heat, poor build quality
Content:
This heater was disappointing when looking at all the features it advertises.  
First, the good: nice size, very good heat production for a medium-sized room with reasonably good insulation and normal ceiling height, not noisy.
The bad: no thermostat reading, only a continuous dial like on cheap cars; timer that didn't work from the moment I removed it from the box; takes 1.5 hours to get room up to desired temp (although this is normal for oil-filled radiators).
It's really too bad that Delonghi can't spend a few extra bucks to build a timer that works well and would be reliable in the long term.  It's a great feature to have, for safety and convenience.  The way it's currently constructed, the timer, and therefore the entire radiator as packaged, is UNRELIABLE.

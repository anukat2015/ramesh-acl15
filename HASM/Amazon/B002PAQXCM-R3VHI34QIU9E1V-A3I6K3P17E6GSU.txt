Title: Decent but Not Perfect
Content:
Got a fantastic deal (not from Amazon) so I couldn't pass it.  Not a bad machine with excellent performance.  Read many people have sudden power failure problem online and I experienced it once about 30 minutes after turned on for the first time.  It just went off without any warning.  So far has not happened again yet.  Keep my fingers crossed.
PRO:
- Good performance;
- Acceptable track pad;
- Nice screen;
- Decent camera;
- Tons of ports;
- Great warranty;
CON:
- Terrible keyboard, left side sinks and feels like falling apart;
- Short Battery life (1.8 hour full performance);
- Lack of good security software (fingerprint scan + facial recognition);
- A little on the heavy side;
- The entire machine, especially around palm rest/track pad area, is very shiny and slippery, personal dislike.

Title: my little magic keyboaed.
Content:
I love my Apple 8GB Ipoid I call it my little magic keyboard. I have DSL. Interet and I can get on the web. with my Ipoid and search down load music and what ever. I've already down loaded tons of music and typed in my Drs.Appointments. their isn't much you can't do with this little machine that you can do with your laptop comouter. My only regret with my 8GB Ipoid is that I did not get a 16GB Ipoid. My honest openion I would say every one that can afford one of these must get them selves one.

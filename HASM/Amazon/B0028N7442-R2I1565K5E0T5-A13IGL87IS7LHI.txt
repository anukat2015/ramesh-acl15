Title: Memory slot could be Easier
Content:
I have no complaints on this Camera except for the SD memory slot is to difficult to take the memory out of the camera... period! One thing missing on the new flagship camera from Pentax is tethered shooting, the ability of a camera of shooting directly to a computer open a lot of uses for it, but that is something I guess Pentax didn't though was necessary to pas from the previous model to this one.

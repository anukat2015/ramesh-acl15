Title: Horrible vacuum
Content:
This vacuum cleaner does not clean!  The  suction is so weak that it won't pick up cat litter and cannot get pet hair out of a carpet.  The canister is so small and the suction so weak, that I have to empty it 3 times just to clean my 900 sq foot house.  Emptying the canister is a disgusting job.  I have to pick pet hair out of the filter with my fingers and out of the various parts where it gets stuck.  I also have to pick out hair that gets stuck in the nozzle.  The supposedly more powerful main attachment was unusable within a month because hair got wrapped around the spinning brush and even pulling the hair out wouldn't make it work.  I hate this cleaner so much and I am so disappointed to have spent a penny on it.  Next time I'm going to get one with a bag so I don't have to manually pick hair and dirt out of a filter 3 times in order to vacuum my house.

Title: Top of the Class.
Content:
For the first time since moving to digital photography a few years back I am completely contented...it's a nice feeling.
I started out in digital with a Leica Digilux 1, then Olympus, Nikon (D70 and D200), Fuji (S2Pro and S5Pro), and a couple of P&S's. 
With each of these cameras, even though I had some very good results, there was always a facet that I wasn't completely happy with.
Now, I feel like I've come home and the Sony A700 is what has done it.
There are many reviews out there that outline this camera's strong points and I won't try to duplicate them here, suffice to say that I have now sold my complete collection of Nikon/Fuji gear (all 29 items) and have replaced them with Sony/Minolta.
All of my old Minolta lenses are now image-stabilized (eg. 200mm 2.8 and 70-210mm 4.0 etc.) and the new lenses are a dream to use. The Carl Zeiss 16-80mm is a great walk-around lens and the CZ 85mm 1.4 is Auto Focus! The Sony (or Minolta) 50mm 1.4 also becomes an image-stabilized lowlight lens. 
I am now achieving a bigger percentage of crisper shots than ever before...straight out of the camera and it really is a delight to use from a handling point of view. I can't think of a single thing on the camera that I would want to change, and I'm usually hard to please.
One very happy camper.

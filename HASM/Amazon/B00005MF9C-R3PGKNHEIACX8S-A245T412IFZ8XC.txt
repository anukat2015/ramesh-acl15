Title: Brilliant!
Content:
This a great little coffee maker for a quick mug of pre-ground. No, it's not a Technivorm or a Capresso, and it's probably not going to last more than a few years at best, but come on, it's 20 bucks. It does what it's supposed to do just fine. For the reviewers having problems with a big mess, you are probably either using too much coffee or you're using fresh ground which will bloom more and needs a little more room in the filter than this one offers. One thing that can help with that is to use paper filters instead of the permanent filter. That will get you a little more room and may solve the problem. I read somewhere that has helped some and I think they were using Melitta #1 filters. For a scoop of pre-ground it does just fine and doesn't make a mess. I'm thrilled with it and when it breaks I'll buy another.

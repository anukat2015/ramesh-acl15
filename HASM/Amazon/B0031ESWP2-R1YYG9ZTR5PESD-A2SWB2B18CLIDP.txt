Title: Love it
Content:
This computer has worked very good for me, I didn't realize when I bought it that it had a numerical keypad, but I am really glad it does. Also I personally like the bubbles, makes it seem more unique. 
Main use for this computer is browsing the web and watching dvds. In the future I may also use it for school. The media center is nicely organized and I've had no problems with Windows 7.

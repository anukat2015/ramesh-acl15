Title: Downgraded Again
Content:
This has made cleaning tile floors a breeze compared to my previous vacuum/swiffer/mop/dry routine. The only assembly you have is attaching the handle to the unit with one provided screw. Easy. It pretty much works right out of the box. I agree with the reviewer who said that nothing cleans a floor like Cinderella-style scrubbing. She's right, but this unit comes pretty close. At worst, I will have to scrub the grout by hand occasionally. 
**update**
Though I still love my Flip-It, it has a few annoying (but not too troublesome) problems. First, When I am wet mopping, occasionally a small amount of water will spray out of the back of the machine. So far I have not found any leaks. I have found that the wastewater compartment needs to be emptied more frequently than recommended. When mopping, suction reduces noticably several minutes before automatic shut-off. Finally- and this is the worst of them all- when I turn off the machine, a small puddle of dirty water siphons out onto my nice clean floor! I place the Flip-It on a small kitchen rug waiting to be thrown into the washer when turning it off to absorb the mess. 
*** update ***
I am no longer in love with my Flip-It. I am ready to flip it into the trash! When using the 'wet' floor cleaner side, it spits water all over the floor and onto the operator (me). I end up with dirty water splashed all over the floor section I just cleaned, and all over my pant legs and shoes. What a mess! It seems that with time, the plastic wastewater collection reservior loses it's ability to stay firmly locked into place. As a result, I get the dirty water geyser at increasingly regular intervals. 
The cleaning solution no longer distributes evenly. I used to get five 2-inch wide swaths of solution when wet mopping. The solution now floods out of some jets, and not out of others.... and sometimes it is fine. 
Finally, the machine makes a noise like a jet engine winding down when I turn it off. It takes 5 to 10 seconds before it is completely silent. This does not sound like a lot of time, I know, but it is terribly annoying and worrisome.

Title: A really fine coffee maker
Content:
We have used this machine for about 4 months now and it is living up to my (high) expectations! I really miss my previous thermal carafe maker (which developed a bad condensation leakage problem) but this is an overall improvement. PLUSES: It serves coffee hotter than the carafe, but its gentle heating arrangement keeps the coffee from scorching inside the internal thermal-lined vessel. It also keeps the coffee reasonably hot for at least an hour if you choose to save energy by turning off heating element. The single-cup dispensing works really well; it flows quickly, does not drip, and is tall enough to easily fill a travel mug. It also does a good job extracting flavor from the coffee. The instructions state that one should use only three quarters of a scoop per cup and that is working well. It can also make A LOT of coffee (up to 12 full-sized cups). A good design engineering feature is that condensation on the lid runs into the filling tank when you open it. It is reasonably attractive. DRAWBACKS: It is bulky, and when full, rather heavy (the price you pay for an internal carafe). In order to fill the coffee basket and water tank, one must the open a rather tall lid all the way. If you keep your coffee maker under a kitchen cabinet, you will need to pull it all the way out each time you fill it.
    Final note: It uses basket-style filters. I bought a permanent filter which turned out to be slightly too tall and the lid did not close completely; because the filter was plastic, I just trimmed it to fit. If you want a metal filter, make sure that it will not be too tall.
    All in all, its relatively minor drawbacks are far outweighed by its other features.

UPDATE: After 10 months, I'm every bit as happy with it! I'd move my rating up to a 5 but the system prevents that.

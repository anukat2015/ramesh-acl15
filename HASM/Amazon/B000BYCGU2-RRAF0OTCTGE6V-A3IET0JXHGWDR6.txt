Title: Good coffee -- easy to use
Content:
I read lots of reviews before deciding upon this product.  I have used it over a year now, and I am very satisfied.  It looks great on the counter and it is very easy to use.  (My only complaint is that the body of the machine is not the same material as the carafe -- in certain light, this is evident -- otherwise, I would have given 5 stars!)

Title: This is the worst
Content:
Boy this sucks, I bought this heater from wal mart and came here to check if anyone else feels jipped. Even sitting right under the heater you hardly feel a thing and it outputs the same amount of cold air from the back as it does warm air from the front. Dont waste your money.

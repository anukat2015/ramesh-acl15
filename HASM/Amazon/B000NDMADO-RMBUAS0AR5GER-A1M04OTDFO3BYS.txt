Title: Great Suction VERY POOR design and engineering
Content:
Dyson knows how to build a vacuum that can really pull the dirt out, but has failed on all other accounts. The cord is so short that you have to pplug it in 3-4 times on one level of the house and the cord retract is so bad you have to hand feed the cord back into the unit. The telescoping wand collapses at will and the hose kinks up constantly. The canister is very small and fills easily. The telescoping wand only has 2 positions; all the way out or all the way in. The unit draws so many amps that it blows a 15 amp breaker with nothing else on the circuit. The attachments fall off easily and are cheaply made. There is no on switch on the handle- very inconvenient. The handle will not lock in the vertical position so you either lay it down or or hold on to it.  I returned mine after two weeks of use and went back to my 6 year old kenmore.

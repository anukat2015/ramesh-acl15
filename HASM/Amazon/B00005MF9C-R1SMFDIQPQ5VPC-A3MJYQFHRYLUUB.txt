Title: I like it !
Content:
I am a lady janitor and true to the myth janitors take lot's of coffee breaks. I was hitting up the local Dunkin Donuts twice a day.At $2.16 a cup it was getting to be an expensive habit for a lady janitors purse. 
I considered getting a Keruig brewer but the cost and the cost of pods was too high for my budget.I also wanted to brew Dunkin Donuts brand ground coffee. 
What I like about the Brew 'n Go:
*The price is perfect! 
*Small and light weight.It's quite small but I would not say this is "desktop size" 
*Brews fast! Takes only about 3-5 minutes to brew a cup.
*Brews a generous amount of coffee.
*Coffee is very hot! Yes, the outer mug surface gets hot but unless your tender skinned it not too hot to hold.The mug keeps it warm for quite a long time.
*I love that it shuts of automatically.
What I don't like about the Brew 'n Go: 
*It takes quite a few tries to peg down exactly how much grinds to use to get a perfect cup.Use too much and you end up with a bitter,messy cup of coffee mixed with grinds (That can happen even if use decide to use a paper filter) Use too few grinds and the coffee will be weak.So, keep in mind that there will be a learning curve to get to your "perfect cup" 
*The mug is nice however it does hold the aroma of coffee after just a few uses.I wash it just after finishing my coffee and I still cannot get the cup to smell clean.This may be an issue for tea/coffee drinkers intending to go back and forth from coffee to tea. 
*The power cord is rather short.This may limit it's placement or require an extension cord. 
Overall, I like it! The price is great.If you are on the fence about getting a Keruig personal brewer perhaps try this first as the price is much lower and the serving size is bigger! I use the #2 cone filters and they fit and work perfectly! The use of a paper filter is neater and faster than using the permanent filter.In closing I find it to be an excellent value.

Title: Be careful about size of coffee grind
Content:
I received one of these as a gift and loved it and used it every day (I am the only coffee drinker in the house). Then I bought some bulk coffee and ground it myself and tried that. It kept getting grinds out of the filter and into the water reservoir and I kept having to clean it. Finally after three months it just died. They sent me a new one (after $7 shipping and handling) and this one is doing the same thing. Now I am almost convinced it is a problem with the grind of the coffee itself (the instructions do not specify which to use). I used an auto drip grind but perhaps that is too fine. Before I was buying pre-ground coffee and had no trouble as long as I did not add more than the 2.5 Tablespoons that the instructions specify. If I added more by accident or did not measure carefully, I had trouble even with the pre-ground. So if you like your coffee strong, I suppose you may want to reconsider this coffeemaker.

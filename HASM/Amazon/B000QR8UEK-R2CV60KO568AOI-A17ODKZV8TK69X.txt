Title: Solid Unit, Satisfactory Performance
Content:
For the price, the 5812 can't be beat.  It supplements my forced air natural gas furnace and keeps two average-sized rooms warm.  The tip-over switch works and the cord has remained cool, even after running for 8 hours with the thermostat set halfway.  The fan does make noise, but it is quiet enough not to disturb your sleep.  
For a larger, uninsulated area such as a 1 or 2 car garage, you probably want something larger.  It is a definite bargain compared to the "infra-red" heaters I see advertised in the local paper for $300+.

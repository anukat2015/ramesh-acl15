Title: Regret buying
Content:
The 605 looked nice the few minets it work, the first thing I did when I got it was to install the firmware update, after that it no longer worked. I've returned it to amazon just waiting now for my refund. Took seconds to buy but I probably won't see my money back for weeks. From all the reviews Archos is not a good product and if you have to deal with Archos customer support it seems your really going to regret buying one.

Title: Great Camera..
Content:
I'm no pro, but I just wanted to improve my good eye for photography with a SLR that could help me "feel it more".
This is my first SLR, I upgraded from a Sony DSC 717 which is a great prosumer camera. However, I wanted to feel the freedom of a SLR in which I can use some different lenses and flashes to add a more professional look to my photos. I have had this one for one month now and have taken like 500 pics. It's incredibly quick to start and it feels way too god. I think that the black body is a huge improvement because it eliminates the cheap feel of the previous 300D.
No complaints until now. Software is good but not a replacement for PhotoShop.

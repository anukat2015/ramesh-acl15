Title: Pros and cons
Content:
My model is US version
Good:
Small size and lightweight.
Lots of RAM.
Usable keyboard for the size.
Small power brick.
Great looking display. 
Windows XP performance is great. 
The external vga / network connector clips to the power brick when not being used.
Bad:
Installing XP is possible but needs a good amount of operation system and driver installation knowledge, and needs a bootable USB CD/DVD drive.
Only 2 USB ports.
VGA and wired network are on an external connector, which is ok when you take into account the size. 
Screen resolution of 1600x600 is too small, try 800x600 or 1024x600.
Pointer stick instead of trackpad, not a problem in my opinion.
Ugly:
Vista, performance is pathetic. Install XP.
XP install of GPS and WAN support is in the early days.

Title: The best combination of price and performance
Content:
This product delivers, exactly as advertised. It is good on floors, powerful on carpets, and is also fairly attractive. Although the toggle on-off switch can get annoying, with that same toggle switch you can "dial up" the suction power of the vacuum, which comes in handy often. Onboard tools are easy to reach and easy to attach. The dirt cup, like I imagined, is messy to use and fills up quickly: I'd advise to empty it when you're taking out the garbage so that the dust doesn't float up every time you open up the trash can or throw something away. You can't beat the lifetime HEPA filter; it even comes with a tiny brush to clean it with. Other vacuums (like the Sanyo dirthunter canister) need to have their filters replaced at $15 a pop. The power cord can be retracted using a pedal with your foot - very convenient. The noise level isn't too bad - I wouldn't say it's the most quiet vacuum but I'm willing to handle a little bit of noise for a little more performance. This vacuum rates better than other canisters on carpets and it's really true. It weighs comparably to other canisters and is not too heavy for a small person to easily carry and maneuver. I was looking for a vacuum that would perform well at a lower price, and be easy to use and maintain, with not too much strain on the ears. I am surprised and glad to say that this Hoover delivers.

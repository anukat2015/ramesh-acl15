Title: Never buy Toshiba
Content:
I purchased the Toshiba P-205-S6237 approx 8 months ago.  This computer has been nothing but a nightmare (We had another Toshiba laptop which is also a piece of junk) Not sure why I bought another.  I will be taking it back in for its 4th DVD/CD drive next week.  Nopnem of them have worked long enough to download any software.  Now what good is a computer if you can't load software? If you read other reviews you will see this is a chronic problem with Toshiba computers.  This machine has spent more time in the repair shop then on my desk!  Toshiba Customer Service is the worst I have ever encountered.  On my first call I was on hold for 67 minutes, then disconnected.  Called again to be on hold for almost 1 hour then transferred to a technician for another 10 minutes.  They tried to talk me into running a recovery disk, which I refused to do.  They insisted it wouldn't remove everything from my computer, which it would.  Their technicians are not well educated and try whatever to get you off the phone. Every employee I spoke with, which was nearly a dozen, had very bad attitudes.  After all this I asked for an address to which I could send a chronology of my issues with this computer.  I sent the letter and never received any type of response.  So to me this means, they just do not care once the item is sold!  I have only one thing to say NEVER BUY TOSHIBA

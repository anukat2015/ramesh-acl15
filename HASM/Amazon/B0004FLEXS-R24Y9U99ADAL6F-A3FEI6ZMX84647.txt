Title: Best Buy in coffee makers
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker based on a Consumer Reports review. They were right on with this one....no problems! It makes good, hot coffee...is simple to operate and program the timer. No leaks or overflows...ever. Apparently that problem has been solved. The only negative is the hot plate has discolored but this does not seem to affect the performance.

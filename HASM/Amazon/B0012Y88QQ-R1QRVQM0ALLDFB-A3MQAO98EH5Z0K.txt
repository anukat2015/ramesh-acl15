Title: WOW!  You can't go wrong with the XSi!
Content:
I've owned the camera for 1 week now, and WOW!  This camera is simply incredible and the picture quality is outstanding!!!  The kit lens that came with it is also impressive when used in bright/outdoor environments.  (Some of my test outdoors pics and indoor pics with my window blinds open have been stunning.)  However, the kit lens is a bit too slow for handheld photography in dark locations unless you use the flash.  
    
For those of you new to photography, a "slow lens" is basically one in which the aperture does not open wide enough to collect the adequate amount of light in darker locations.  Therefore, the shutter stays open longer until enough light has been collected.  This also means that if your hand shakes, pictures snapped in dark enough settings will come out blurry.  This is not exclusive to the XSi as slow lenses on any camera will produce similar results.  If blurry indoor pics are not what you desire, you can correct this by using the flash, using a tripod, or...  
        
BUY A NEW LENS!  The XSi can use ANY Canon EF/EF-S lens on the market...and this includes "faster" ones as well!!  With faster lenses (ie, f/1.8), soon you'll be shooting like a pro indoors also!
     
In the end, when considering its wide range of features, customizable flexibility, and it's picture quality, I think any rookie or seasoned pro would be delighted with the XSi.

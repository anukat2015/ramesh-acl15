Title: Great little heater
Content:
This is a great little spot heater. I would highly recommend it. Perfect for heating your room or bathroom. Close the doors let this thing go for a little bit and the room will be really warm. It's very quiet, just a slight hum and it's small and portable. I usually just put it on high since the lower settings seem pointless. Probably not the best for heating a large, open space - such as your living room - but the price is right for this quality heater that has a lot of force to it and it still would probably work better than most heaters for that purpose so try this one before you get a more expensive heater.

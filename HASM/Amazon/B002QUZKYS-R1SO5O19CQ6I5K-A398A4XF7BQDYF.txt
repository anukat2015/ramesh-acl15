Title: Great Value
Content:
This laptop is a real standout for the price. Fast. clean. Minimal bloatware that was easy to remove. I'd easily recommend this as a basic laptop for everyday use.  The numeric keypad is a nice extra.  About my only concern is that the shell on the lid feels a bit thin.
1/1/10 Followup - I've had this a little more than a month, and things are still fast and clean.  I do see a little of the skipped letters others mentioned.  Not enough yet to worry, but we'll have to see (spellcheck is becoming my friend on longer documents).  For those inclined - installation of, and dual booting to Ubuntu went smoother than usual.

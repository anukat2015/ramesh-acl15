Title: Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera
Content:
since no one yet written a review for this camera body, I think I should write one just to give you some idea. The eos 40D is newly introduced in this August, Aug 07. One thing pops up to me is the LCD live preview. The LCD live preview is first introduced in Olympics DSLR. It allows the user to have live preview in the LCD like the most of the Non-DSLR do. It is useful to take pictures in a rather different angle such low in the ground.
  another thing is the 6.5 fps shutter mechanic. now you can shoot 6.5 pictures in a second up to 75 pictures. You will never lose any thing with this camera in continuous mode.
  The 40D now updated with a dust removing system which first found in the 400D. In my professorial opinion, it really doesn't useful. You just need to be cautious when you change the lens. 
  The most important update to me is now that 40D has a bigger viewfinder.  A bigger viewfinder means brighter, easily to focus, and bigger. Those entry DSLRs just aren't big enough.
In conclusion, the 40D is an affordable professional and serious amateur photographer's first choice. If you don't have one, you should own one.

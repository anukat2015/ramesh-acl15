Title: It meets all of my expectations!
Content:
The vacuum this replaced was an Electrolux that we purchased new in 1952. Even though the Electrolux brand has been passed along, this machine seems to be rock solid and well built like the old one.  It runs circles around it, which is still running in good order except that it needs a hose that we can't find and bags that are no longer standard and available.  The new one is easier to use and lighter.  The power head does a good job lifting dirt from our carpets and is easy to use. An added plus is the hepa filter, but we didn't notice much dust escaping the old one ether. I highly recommend this machine. We don't often see quality in appliances in this throw-away generation, but this machine sticks to the old values...and it's price is right!

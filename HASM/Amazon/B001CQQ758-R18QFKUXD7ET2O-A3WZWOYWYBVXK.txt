Title: heats as advertised
Content:
Heats as advertised.
Worked really well in my downstairs area. I bought this and another unit for my whole house (3 stories). I have been able to lower my thermostat 3 degrees by adding this unit and the Dimplex CS3311 Compact Electric Stove. So it has been better than expected
The only downside is that I wish they had a handle on both sides to eas the carrying when moving.

Title: Great Upgrade
Content:
I had a 10D for quite awhile now and it was becoming a bit long in the tooth.
I had thought of upgrading to the 20D or 30D when they came out.  Though each of those were nice upgrades I did not feel any of them were compelling enough to pull the trigger.
When the rumblings on what was going to be included in the 40D started happening, I waited to see what would happen and there were enough new features to justify the upgrade.
The ones that immediately caught my eye were
1.) Sensor cleaning
2.) Live View
3.) A big jump in megapixels from my 10D
4.) Quicker focus
In other words these were the main "wish" list for me.
I could not be more pleased with the camera and the results.  
Of course manual sensor cleaning is always needed despite built in sensor cleaning, but having the sensor cleaning and mapping features seem to be working so far and if it means the sesnor does not have to be cleaned as often, it is a plus.
Though I still shoot through the view finder the majority of the time the Live View is a nice feature and works well and I am glad Canon finally has it in their dSLR.
People sometimes get too caught up in megapixels, but the jump between the 10D and the 40D is a substantial one.  Going from 8 megapixels (if you have a 20D or 30D) may not be that noticable, but from 6 megapixels to 10 is noticiable for cropping.
The Canon 40D is also quick to focus and is good in low light.  As others have noted there are many other upgrades and features which also contribute to making the 40D worthwhile.
Bottom line is you have any of the D series and like them, you will like this camera.  Well worth the move from a 10D and probably the 20D.  The 30D is a bit closer call I would guess.

Title: A sad disappointment
Content:
Last year for Christmas, my wife gave me a gen4 Nano that I absolutly love. This year, I decided to return the favor and get her an ipod for Christmas. I gave it to her early so she could enjoy our Christmas cd's on it.
I have to say that while my wife does like it, there are obvious issues with gen5. Fist off, the outputs on the base of the unit have been reversed so the gen5 requires it's own mount to use it on any docking station! Why can't Apple stick with one body style for the nano. So now all the included adaptors in home theater systems are obsolete once again; makes no sense what-so-ever.
The gen5 has a built in speaker that is completly useless! Sound is emitted out of the base of the unit. At best it sounds like and old time transistor radio, only without the volume! The video recoder is very awkward to use with little relivence to listing to your favorite tunes.  The genius is still with us, another useless feature if you have an eclectic musical taste. The playlist feature works alot better and is much more fun. 
The unit works ok and we did not find any defects with it. We did not have any of the click-wheel issues that other reviwers have commented on. For me the bottom line is that Apple has takin a good thing and cluttered it with a bunch of new features. The Ipod classic would of been a much better platform for this stuff with it's 160gb's of storage. All of these features that have been added to gen5 take up precious storage space for your rockin tunes or arias, whatever the case may be.

Title: K100D+18-55mm zoom
Content:
I finally added the K100D to my Pentax collection. I started with Pentax SLRs over 30 years ago. Spotmatic, then ME Super, then ZX-7, a IR focus Point and Shoot along with many lenses and accessories. 
A few years ago I tried switching to digital and have not been really satisfied with the lack of the feel of a 35mm SLR. But liked the convenience of immediate download of pictures and ability to select, fix and manipulate the images prior to processing. 
Along comes the K100D and I couldn't resist. It has the feel and sound of the 35mm. It's been fun dusting off my old equipment and putting it to use again. Best of all it's been great to look at photography as a creative hobby again versus just point and shoot pictures that I got myself into with the other small digitals. Got a few great shots during that time but not many. I know that is all in the mind but having a great set of tools tends to get the mind going better. 
Anyway, the camera works absolutely wonderful. My old lenses, Sigma Auto Focus zooms from the ZX-7 work flawlessly with the K100. Have not tried the manual lenses yet. Image stabilizer feature is well worth it. Test shots handheld in low light conditions with slow shutter, over 400mm and macro are very stable. 
Guess I'll need to seal my 35mm bodies in a bag and wait until they are antiques to sell them. 
I do a lot of internet shopping, buying and investigations. Amazon had the best buy on the K100 with lense, shipping and Amazon VISA promo. It was delivered in 2 days. I was impressed with the product and service through Amazon.

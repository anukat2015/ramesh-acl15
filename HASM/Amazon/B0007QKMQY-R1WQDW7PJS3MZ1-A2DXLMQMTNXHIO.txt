When looking for a d-SLR for a class at school i desided on this Canon. i was amazed at how easy it was to use and how nice the pictures turned out for my class. This camera comes with an ok lens it gets the job done and is even lighter then the film camera i have. Most of the pictures i took with this camera and basic len did not even have to be adjusted in a photo program the color and contrast was already great. i also know someone with the orignal Rebel and the hand grip is a bit large and easier to hold but is by far heavier.
so great camera for the price and package but would recomend getting the case and extra battery and maybe another lens.

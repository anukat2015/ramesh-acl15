Title: Best Laptop I have ever owned
Content:
Best laptop that I have ever owned hands down.
- It's well built and feels very solid which surprised me given its low price. 
- It is powerful, I can watch HD 1080p video including YouTube videos once you update to the Beta Flash Player 10.1  
- The keyboard has full sized keys making it easier to type compared to smaller netbook.
- The 11.6 screen is excellent. I never had to do any horizontal scrolling to view any websites.
The only negative is that the layout of the keyboard is a little weird. Especially the tiny direction arrows. I've gotten used to it the more I type on it.

Title: Perfect in every way!
Content:
I have owned this computer for about 2 weeks and have been very impressed with it.  With the 2 gigs of ram and the 250gig hard drive, you have plenty of speed and storage.  If you find that this is not enough, you can upgrade to 4 gigs of ram.  I also have a 500gig external hard drive to supplement for storage.  Unlike a netbook, this has a 11.6" screen. Believe me this makes a difference.  I bought a Samsung 10.1" netbook about 3 weeks ago to run music for a quartet I sing with and was so impressed I wanted one for myself.  I found this little gem and have fallen in love at first sight.  I would tell you to get it.  You will not be disappointed.

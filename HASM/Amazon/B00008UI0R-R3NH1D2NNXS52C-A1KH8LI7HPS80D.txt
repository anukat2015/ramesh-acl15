Title: H I G H L Y Recommended!
Content:
After being an upright vacuum clean owner for several years now, I decided that it was time to consider a canister.  With bagless becoming more and more popular, I wanted to also consider vacuums with this feature.  Hoover has always proved to be an excellent manufacturer that makes durable and affordable products.
With that in mind, I first looked at the Hoover S3755 Bagless WindTunnel Canister, but then liked the S3765-040 much better due to the extra attachments.
The new Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum arrived today, took it out of the box, connected a few pieces and started vacuuming...so simple.  It is lightweight and the suction/clean capability is amazing.  After vacuuming, I emptied the dirt cup and could not believe the volume of dirt...bagless is the way to go.  
The WindTunnel exceeded my expectations and would H I G H L Y recommend it.  If you don't like this vacuum or write a poor review on it, you obviously have not used it.  
Compare it to the competition and then you will see why the Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum is the benchmark in it's class...the one vacuum by which all others should be measured.

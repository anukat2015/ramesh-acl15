Title: DON'T BUY IT!
Content:
Unfortunately, I bought the product on the Apple reputation--and returned it two days after getting it.   I never could get it to work due to problems with the iTunes software.  If it did work, it would only be fully functional with the cheap Apple headphones that are uncomfortable, would not stay in the ear during vigorous running or exercise, and probably do not deliver acceptable sound quality.  Don't make my mistake!

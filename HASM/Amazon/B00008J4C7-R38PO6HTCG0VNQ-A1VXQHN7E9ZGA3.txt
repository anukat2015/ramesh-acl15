Title: 2 years now worthless
Content:
1. The "turbo" air powered vacuum heads do not work well
2. Had to clean out filter every time it was used
3. Nut on fan blade came loose and burned up the motor
4. Their local repair shop charged $30 to tell me it was not worth repairing.
All true, do not buy!

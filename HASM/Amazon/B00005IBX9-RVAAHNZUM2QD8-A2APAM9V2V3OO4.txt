Title: It was a wonderful coffeemaker...
Content:
I only write this in hopes someone might have some suggestions.  I have used this coffee maker for 20 months and have had no problems.  I ran the self-cleaner yesterday and now it won't brew.  I checked everything I know to look at.  It just doesn't seem to want to pump the water thru or whatever.  Maybe a clog somewhere?  A note:  The filter is some sort of material not charcoal.  I just take it out and wash it out occasionally.  Thanks

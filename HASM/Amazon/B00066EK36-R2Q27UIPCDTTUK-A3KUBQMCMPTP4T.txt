Title: Product Issue / Rotten Customer Service
Content:
There are two issues with the SanDisk 256 that I purchased a few weeks ago.
1. If eq is changed from "normal" setting the music slows down and is garbled.  
2. After my attempt to get customer service to respond via email, my experiece with calling the SanDisk Tech Support was also a failure.  
My recommendation would be to buy a mp3 player from a company that stands behind their products and appreciates their customers.

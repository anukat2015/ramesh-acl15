Title: FANTASTIC SUCTION - LARGE BAG - BEST OUTDOOR VAC EVER, EXCEPT....
Content:
THIS IS THE BEST OUTDOOR VACUUM CLEANER I HAVE EVER USED OR HAD!   BUT, EVEN THINGS AS SMALL AS GUM WRAPPERS AND NUTS GET STUCK IN THE NARROW PIPE BEND.  HAVE TO REMOVE CONSTANTLY TO RUN HIGH PRESSURE WATER THROUGH IT.  LUCKILY THE FAUCET IN THE GARAGE IS HIGH PRESSURE WATER FLOW AND HIGH ENOUGH ABOVE THE SINK TO DO THIS!  
Other than that.... I LOVE This Vacuum Cleaner!!

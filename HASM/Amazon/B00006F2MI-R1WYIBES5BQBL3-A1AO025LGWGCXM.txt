Title: DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!
Content:
I gave this machine 1 star because the carafe does not drip -- and this is important!  However, for a household that brews several pots of coffee a day and likes a good, rich, bold cup of coffee, the Cuisinart Grind & Brew is a poor choice.  The grinder doesn't have the bean capacity for 10 cups (however, the carafe is really closer to 8 or 9 six-oz cups).  WEAK COFFEE.  If you grind a batch then turn it off and grind a second go to make a suitable pot, it is STILL weak.  Somehow the brewing process wastes coffee.  It backs up into the grinder and makes a royal mess.  Of course if you want to brew another pot in an hour or two, the grinder has to be hand-dried after you wash it with a bottle brush to get all of the wasted, caked, wet grounds out of the grinder.  Now here's the real kicker that nearly drove my husband over the edge.  Say you've washed the grinder and it's drying in your drainer so you decide to brew a pot of GROUND coffee, you still have to use the grinder!!!  It won't brew without it in place! so all that condensation flows right back up into the grinder, which stays perpetually WET and begins to pool in all the indentations here and there in the grinding chamber.  It's a mess.  The coffee us terrible -- even if you use plentiful, bold Starbucks coffee!!  Gosh!  We might as well have flushed $150 down our toilet . . .

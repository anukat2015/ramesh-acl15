Title: Don't Buy...Don't Buy...
Content:
(1) Poor picture quality.  Horizontal lines on vids due to low quality resolution.  Blown away by the amazing quality of iPod...but Zune is truely disappointing.  
(2) 50% thicker the comparable 30GB iPod.  In fact, even the 60GB-80GB iPod is slimmer.  
(3) Wheel mouse is difficult to use and not cool. 
(4) Cheap design.  Plastic snap-on to the surface looks like its going to break off. 
Zune is hand down NOT even nearly comparable to iPod's superior design, function and quality.  Forget Zune for Christmas.  Its absolutely horrible.  
By the way, the brown looks like the color of feces.  Overall player just grosses me out.

Title: very disappointed!
Content:
The 5-STAR reviews are all written by one or two people!  Do not believe them!  
What a major mistake Apple made in designing this thing.  It is so frustrating trying to deal with this accelerometer; it will drive you crazy! It is so annoying and unavoidable it will make you not want to bring your Nano with you. Just the slightest movement and the Nano goes into a different mode - I don't want it to go into a different mode! I was really looking forward to my new nano.  I am returning it tomorrow.

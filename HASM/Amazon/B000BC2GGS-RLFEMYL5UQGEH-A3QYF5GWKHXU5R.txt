Title: WARNING......DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
Content:
This product is like throwing money in the trash. All the while giving you a big headache. First, the company Kaz is VERY lacking in customer service. With just a 30 day refund/return policy (with restocking fees and shipping) .. clothing stores offer longer full refund time and this is an electrical unit versus cloth. I was complaining about the product not working right from the get go and all i got from the customer service rep was "try this.. try that...and don't forget you purchased it on-line from Kaz on October 18th even though you got it sometime in November you still only have until November 18th to return it and there will be a 20% restocking fee (which doesn't make sense since the company doesn't even make the product anymore) and you'll have to pay shipping". which by the way adds up to what the product cost originally. The product supposedly has a 5 yr manufacturer's warranty but I have yet to hear anything about that. Second, the product has 50% failure rate and is no longer being made because the company can not figure out how to fix the defect. Third, it does not produce constant heat and the thermostat has a mind of it's own and does not read the room temperature right. Fourth, it gets way too hot to the touch, why it got high safety ratings and why it was aired on CNN as being the best heater, I don't know. Fifth, it's way too bulky for the heat it puts off... when it works. Sixth, the instructions are completely lacking.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

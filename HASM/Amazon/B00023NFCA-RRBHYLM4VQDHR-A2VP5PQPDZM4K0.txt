Title: I would give it 10 stars but it is not an option

This is a real bargain right now and soon you won't be able to get one.  Don't listen to a handful of the negative reviews. KM still exists, but now will be making cameras for Sony. It is supported by Sony and new lenses will be available soon.  Digital Cameras are like computers these days.  In a couple of years as technology changes, you will want to upgrade the body anyway.

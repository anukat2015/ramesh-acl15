Title: Does it's job, and looks good to boot.
Content:
I have a small 900 sqft condo.  I don't even have to turn on the heater at all.  One unit warms up my entire living area rather well (about 550 sq feet).  Outside temperature is at around the middle 40f's, and without it, the living area gets to about 60f.  With it on at high, it gets to about a comfy 70f.  It's actually rather quiet.  That's one thing I didn't expect.  Wow, Say goodbye to turning on the thermostat.  It keeps my bedroom more than warm enough.
It has simple features.  It doesn't have its own temperature gauge, so it can't turn off and on whenever it dips below a certain temperature.  However, with my experience thus far, I found no need to even have such a feature.  
The construction and quality is very good.

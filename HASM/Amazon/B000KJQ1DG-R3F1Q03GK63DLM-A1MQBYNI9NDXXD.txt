Title: Nikon D40 rocks
Content:
Nikon D40 was our first DSLR purchase.  Before this we have owned only point and shoot cameras.  My colleague and friends convinced me to go for a DSLR.  After a lot of reaseach and much debate, we went for the Nikon D40 instead of D60 or D90.  I am glad that I went for the Nikon D40 because it is a great entry level camera.  I am an amateur and the feature set is just right.  It took me about 30 minutes of reading and playing with the camera to figure out the basic modes and start shooting.  Took it to Europe and it did a great job in taking the pictures.  My wife took a lot of pictures from a moving car and they came out great.  The pictures of the Swiss Alps were just amazing along with Lake Luzerne and other pictures
The only drawback is the basic lens.  It works fine on landscape.  However, the zoom is not enough if you want to take the picture of an individual who is more than 10-12 feet away.  If you want to do that, you would have to get an additional lens.  Overall,  I love the camera.  It is light, easy to carry and works very well for an amateur like myself

Title: Apple iPod - poor quality
Content:
I bought iPod nano 8 GB about 16 months ago; what I noticed is battery life started to get weak after few months of charging & discharging. About after 11 months of use the iPod just failed; would not even power up. When I took it to Apple store, they told me warrenty had expired and will not repair or replace it. I felt betrayed - if I had known this I would have bought a cheaper some other brand rather than wasting my money on Apple! I really didn't get the better user experience, quality, etc I was looking for with Apple. :(

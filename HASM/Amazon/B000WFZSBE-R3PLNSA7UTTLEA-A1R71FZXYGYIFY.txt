Title: Lasted 4 days.
Content:
After loading 10 gig of music the unit locked up.  None of the navigation buttons worked and I couldn't get off the song it was playing.  It was stuck in a continuous loop.  I tried all the described reset functions to no avail.  Its hard to believe Microsoft would make a product without their most important key stroke combination, Ctrl Alt DeL.  When I packaged the item for return it was still playing U2 War.  I realize there is a bad apple (Microsoft) in every bunch.  I haven't decided if I will give Zune another try.  I much prefer it over Apple since its not so proprietary.  If my next experience is more positive.  I will update at that time.  I'll give it two stars because I really enjoyed our brief time together and after-all, it is a MS product so I am used to my expectations being crushed.

Title: Fabulous vacuum
Content:
I researched this vacuum at length, debating whether to get a cannister or an upright, and after reading the reviews, decided on this one. It's a solid, well built little dynamo! I was amazed at how much dirt and dust were in my carpet, and vacuumed the same room 3 times, until there were just minute particles in the cannister.  The nap on the rug was raised and fluffy, and CLEAN! Although it comes with a hard floor head, I found that turning the beater bar off works well enough on other surfaces when going from room to room.  It also comes with a small rotating brush attachment that's perfect for furniture and stairs.  You can adjust the suction power on the handle with the touch of a finger, which somes in handy, as the highest power will suck up floor mats in a snap. The cannister emptys easilly, and the cartridge filter rinses clean under running water.  The only drawback is that the cannister fills quickly, and may have to be emptied between rooms if you have a large area.  Other than that, I would recommend this machine.

Title: Awesome vacuum
Content:
I am really lovin this vacuum. The suction on the hardwood floor attachment is fabulous, and that was what I was most concerend with when I went about purchasing a new vacuum. I have two large shag area-rugs and the main head does a wonderful job on them. Somewhere on the internets someone complained about the hose being cheap....it's not. It's stiff, and I'm hoping with use it will become pliable but if it never does I'm OK with that. Also, it is pretty heavy, I wouldn't want to be luggin this thing around if you have stairs to vacuum, unless you want to set it down on each step. On the other hand, if you have to carry it around, it will definitely build muscle, and as well all know, more muscle helps burn fat.......just puttin a postive spin on it. This vacuum not not look or feel cheaply made like someone had suggested. I have been buyin one cheap $100 vacuum year after year for the last 7 years and let me tell you, THOSE are cheaply made. This vacuum is sturdy work horse. I highly recommend.

Title: Loved it until it broke almost right away!
Content:
I loved the way the Vortex Digital Heater heated and the way it kept cool to the touch.  But within a week, the one I had started cutting off when it hit the set temperature and did not come back on.  I was worried that it was overheating all the time and called Vortex who told me I could send it in at my expense and pay $15 to fix it.  I emailed my Amazon seller (Louise at Pinnacle Packaging) who was wonderful and paid to have it sent back to her, and is going to refund my money.  I think I am going to buy another one only I am going to purchase it from a local store and make sure I can bring it back if the new one does the same thing.  I guess I am a sucker but I really liked the way the thing worked when it worked correctly!

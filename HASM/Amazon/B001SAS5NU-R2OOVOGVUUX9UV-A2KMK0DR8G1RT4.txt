Title: So far, so GREAT!
Content:
I just gave a refurbished DC21 for my mom for Christmas and it is fantastic!  She and my step-dad live in a tiny and DUSTY farm house with 4 dogs (Yes, they are the crazy dog people.) and they have gone through so many vacuums over the years that they had pretty much given up on ever finding one that worked for them.  The canister design is prefect for them because they can get under the couches and cabinets to pick up all the dust and dog hair...you wouldn't believe how much we got on the first trip around the house!  It picks up all the dog hair off the carpets and cleans the rugs in the mud room (entry way)...the ones my mom used to have to take outside and beat with a broom and they would still never look as clean as they do now!
Yes, the vacuum is a little heavy and maybe even a bit awkward, but it does the job better than anything else we have ever owned and it is well worth the effort.  My mom says she will think of it as her workout machine as well as her cleaning machine.  I would definitely recommend the refurbished Dyson to anyone that wants one but is nervous about taking the $400 leap.  It works just like new and comes with a 6 month limited warranty from Dyson.

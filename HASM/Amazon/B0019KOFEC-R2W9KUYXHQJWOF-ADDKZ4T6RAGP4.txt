Title: Good Little Vac For the Money
Content:
Bought this little number to replace my 29 year old Hoover Canister.  I mainly wanted it for the carpeted stairs. Although I have a bamboo kitchen floor and linoleum foyer that I would also use it on, the main reason for the canister was for the stairs. I have an Oreck upright for the rest of the house and no pets for extra goodies deposited on the rugs.
This vac is quite powerful but they need to revisit the lousy hose which gets totally tangled when doing steps.  Also, the air intake that opens when one rotates the hose is another pain.  My old Hoover had such an intake and it snapped into place which is what Eureka should have done.  Also, the rug attachments should snap into place not just be pushed on.  And the dog paw attachment should be a convertible attachment that can become just a flat valve opening that would work easier for someone on a stairwell (who does not have animal hair to contend with). Also, the bend in the hard plastic that attaches to the hose should be straight for someone who gets down on steps and is not standing above them but rather are on the same level as the steps being vacuumed.
But this is a sweet little vac and although I don't expect to get 29 years out of it, I hope it sticks around for maybe 10!

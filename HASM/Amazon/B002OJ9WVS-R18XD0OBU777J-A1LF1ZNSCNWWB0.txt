Title: If you live in Canada, it gets even better.
Content:
I just wanted to give a heads up to anybody living in Canada thinking of purchasing the Miele S4212.  I did my research online looking for the best deal for this S4212 and found it at [..]where they are currently selling the Miele S4212 Special Edition for [...] Canadian.  I just bought mine yesterday at my local Costco for $[...](I was surprised that it was $[...]cheaper in store to boot!) and I am loving it.

The Special Edition S4212 comes in the Special Edition Steel Blue Metallic color for $[...] CDN has all the above features plus:
- Miele STB 205-3 Turbobrush worth ~$[...] USD.  The Miele STB 205-3 Turbobrush attachment was designed to make cleaning effortless, and it delivers. It features a rotating brush that's activated by air drawn through the head, loosening dirt & collecting fluff and hair. Its buffer strip protects furniture from scuffing, too. It's ideal for cut pile and gives your carpet an excellent finish.
- Miele STB 101 Mini Turbobrush worth ~$[...] USD.  It is a hand-held revolving brush.  Recommended for stairs, furniture and upholstered surfaces where more aggressive cleaning is needed.
- Miele SBB300-3 Parquet Floor Brush worth ~$[...] USD.  The parquet floor brush is designed for wood and tiled floors.It has 2 soft rollers for an easy gliding action and genuine horsehair bristles that sweep gently over the floor surface,brushing dust particles out of cracks.
- Miele Style FJM Vacuum Bags Includes 4 bags + 2 Filters worth ~$[...] USD
*** Please note that the special edition does NOT come with the Combination Carpet/Smooth Floor Tool SBD450-3 worth [...]USD as standard.  The Miele Galaxy Rug & Floor Tool has lever which lets you switch between carpets and bare floors. For bare floors a brush strip along the front and squeege along the back pop out to provide soft, non-scratching cleaning action. Notches along the front of the brush allow dirt to easily enter the nozzle. For carpets and rugs, the brush strip and squeege are recessed, allowing the channeled steel sole plate to contact the carpet, pulling air through the nap to clean it. A soft, non-scratching roller under the elbow bears any downward pressure, enabling the nozzle to glide gently over the floor.
Anyway, I personally found it a fantastic deal with all the extras for purchasing this Miele S4212 in Canada and I wanted to share it with all of you.  Here's the link and enjoy!

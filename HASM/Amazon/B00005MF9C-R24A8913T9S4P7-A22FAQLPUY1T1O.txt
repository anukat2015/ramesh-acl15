Title: Great one cup coffee maker
Content:
If you want a quick and good cup of coffee this product fits the bill.  We have three coffee drinkers in our family and we prefer this one cup model over a larger capacity maker.  I want my coffee fresh, and even thermal makers don't satisfy me. It's also great when you are in a hurry.  No need to wait for a pot of coffee to brew. 
It can be used with your favorite cup or mug. You aren't limited to  the mug that comes with the coffee maker. It accommodates a small cup or a large stainless travel mug. Even though it comes with a pernament filter we also use a paper filter.  Yes, I'm fussy about coffee. 
It's an excellent value

Title: I got this item and I'm loving it
Content:
I just wanted to say thank you to both Apple and Amazon for making this a really good deal, I just ordered this Macbook Pro 13 to gift it to a friend of mine, opened it to load the Microsoft Office Mac 2008, and let me tell you this, the machine was so cool, fast and reliable. I'm going to purchase the higher specs one for myself though I really don't have any cons about this one but let's say that I want to avoid a later on upgrade to mine, the screen is so amazing, I own and worked on all kind of LCD's, computers (HP, Dell, IBM Thinkpad, Sony Vaio, Toshiba and others) and this by far was way better machine, the boot-up speed was fast enough to notice, every Vista or Windows 7 or whatever MS OS you may have is terribly slow compared to this one, it's got everything anyone could possibly need, Office software, iWork looks great, I've tried it at Apple store and didn't need it at this time because I ordered MS office (if you work on Excel spreadsheets and Access you would need this as iWorks doesn't support advanced Macros and other features comes from Microsoft, what you're not told when you but the Microsoft office is that each package you get (you pay around $120) for that, you get 3 licenses to be used on 3 different Mac's, so that's a really cool thing if you;re buying/own more than one Apple computer.
updates are reliable and secured and it only take few minutes to download them and install them, no waiting for 30-45 min on PC,
I just wanted to say that I really liked this product.

Title: A great camera
Content:
We recently upgraded to the EOS Rebel Xsi from a point-and-shoot Olympus camera primarily to eliminate picture-taking delay. It is our first Digital SLR camera and so far we've been very pleased. It has surpassed all of our expectations, it takes great pictures, is easy to use, and offers a lot of features for the price (Amazon was by far the cheapest). It's a great camera, we're having fun using it, and we'd recommend it to others.

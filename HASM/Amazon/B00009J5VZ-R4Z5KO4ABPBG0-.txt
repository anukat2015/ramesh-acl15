Title: Ipod/Itunes Rock!
Content:
I got a the Ipod 15GB as a great bundle deal at famous online auction. It came with a &quot;loaded&quot; powerbook G4 12&quot; for a fraction of retail.itunes/ipod rock! I was getting so sick of carrying all my cds around!!I know Ipods are the expensive MP3 palyers but if you buy it at auction it is worth it given the quality and how easy it is to use. The firewire makes it so fast to update change or add music to your Ipod. You can make as many lists as you want to listen to your music.The earphones are great, I also have a Radio Shack titanium Headphones but Irather use the ipod earphones since they are so small and give such great sound. I sometimes connect my Ipod to my home stereo and what a sound and I never have to change cds I just make a list and play it for as long as I want and hear as many different songs that I want!I also use my Ipod as a portable hard drive, a calendar, and an address book.Awesome little gadget!

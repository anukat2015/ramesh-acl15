This vacuum replaced a similar Hoover that I had for many years.  I chose to replace rather than repair the old vacuum because some of the electrical wiring were sending out sparks.  I decided that it was time for a new vacuum.  The power and suction capacity of this vacuum is wonderful!  My 19 year old wall to wall carpet has not looked so well for many years,  I particularly appreciate the ability to control the amount of suction.
I had my 3 and 1/2 year old twin granddaughters over for Halloween.  Their costumes had a lot of glitter that was all over my furniture and carpet.  I thought the clean up would involve my sitting on the ground for hours with a tweezer to pick up all of the glitter!  Instead, I used the vacuum on high suction and it got all of it with no hassle.  Thank you Hoover.

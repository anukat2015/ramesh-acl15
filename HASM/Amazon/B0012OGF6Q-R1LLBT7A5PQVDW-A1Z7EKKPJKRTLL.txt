Let me tell you folks this is a great camera this is my first SLR I moved up the ladder from point and shoot digitals to ultra-zoom point and shoot  to graduate to this and I am impressed I am considered to be an entry level  photographer and this camera with a little help from the manual and on screen instructions will make you a better photographer than you ever thought capable I have pictures of fireworks that I was able to slow the shutter down and really get the trails in the sky

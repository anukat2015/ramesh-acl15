Title: Only device for me!
Content:
While I no longer own this item due to an untimely, accidental crushing of the screen which resulted in it being completely unusable, this Zune model had me blown away in the month that I did have it. Having owned 2 iPod Nanos (1st & 3rd generation) and the Video (5th Generation), I can honestly say without bias that Microsoft's product is the better buy. The quality headphones. The wireless syncing. The lack of frozen screen episodes and inclusion of stellar battery life. The radio. I especially like the interface of the software better compared to iTunes. It's much easier adding the files you want. Definitely buying a new one when I save up.

Title: Dirt Devil Canister
Content:
If you are a canister person you will like this vacuum. I have had Dirt Devils for a number of years and this is the second vacuum of the same model. My first one lasted for 8 years. I guess you can make and argument for it only lasting 8 years, but at the end of the day, I felt I got my moneys worth out of it. The motor burned out but I liked it enough to get a duplicate. What I like about it are the mobility (easy to maneuver, sling it over your shoulder if you like), light and easy to clean. Just wash the filter on a regular basis in it will last a long time too. The attachments are good and they are strapped to the main tubes making it easy to access. It has a strong suction. Perhaps the only negative is it's a bit loud, but not that bad. I have also had good service for the one time I ordered a replacement filter. Bottom line, it's a good buy.

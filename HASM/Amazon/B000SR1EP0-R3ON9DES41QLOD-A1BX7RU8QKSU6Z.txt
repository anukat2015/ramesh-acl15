Title: Doesn't Last
Content:
Mine arrived fine but the heater broke within 7 months.  Some websites say that there is a one year warranty on it, but the company I bought it from informed me there is no warranty on it.  Right now it heats up but the fan stops running and then it overheats.  Save the money get a good radiant heater for winter and a window unit.

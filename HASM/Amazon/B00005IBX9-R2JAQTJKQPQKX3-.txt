Title: Cool design. Cold coffee.
Content:
Fantastic design. Great looks. Neat features.Ice-cold coffee.Anytime you can pour a cup and drink it right away it's too cold. That's the unfortunate case with this machine. I've been using it for about a week and I'm so disappointed.If you don't mind microwaving your coffee after you make it, buy this machine. I, for one, am returning mine today.

Title: Best Coffee Pot ever
Content:
This coffee maker makes the best coffee.  We had this pot 3 years ago but when we finally started having problems with it we did not want to spend the additional money to get another one like it.  That was our mistake I bought cheaper coffee makers but with the 3 pots a day we make they only last 2-3 months so by the time I bought 3 coffee makers in a year I could have just bought this one cheaper.  My husband was constantly saying he'd like another Cuisinart so for Christmas this year he got his wish.

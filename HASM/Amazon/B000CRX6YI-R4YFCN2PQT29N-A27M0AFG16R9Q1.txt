Title: WOW!!!
Content:
Fantastic!!! Don't worry about it being too much to handle, you can literally start by using it as a point and shoot if you want, and move into pro territory with it. You'll grow into it. I suggest the highly regarded
"Guide to Nikon D200" by Thom Hogan eBook. Over 700 pages. It's the REAL manual for this treasure.

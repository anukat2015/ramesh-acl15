Title: good product
Content:
I purchased this as a gift and the initial product did not work.  However, amazon was very responsive and replaced the product quickly and even paid for shipping.  The replacement works well.  I personally have had this product for close to 2 years now.  My only problem with it is that the size of the cup of coffee produced varies.  I always use the full cup setting and sometimes i get half a cup and sometimes more like a quarter of a cup.   My mom, who I purchased the new one for, reports the same issue.  But overall a good product for the price.

Title: Almost 5 stars
Content:
The UL30VT is a stellar machine...especially with an OCZ Vertex SSD.
The ONLY issue I have with this machine is the touchpad.  As a Mac user, I've become spolied by the fantastic touchpads Macbooks use.  With that said, I find the touchpad response to be jerky and inconsistent.  I am disappointed that multitouch and design was chosen over quality singletouch and function.  I find the multitouch functions to be useless because of the inaccuracy of the touchpad.  I also don't think the surface itself is practical for a touchpad, as it is so glossy that you have to use more effort than usual to glide your finger around.
It suprises me that I haven't seen more talk about this...
Apart from that, a great machine...almost perfect.

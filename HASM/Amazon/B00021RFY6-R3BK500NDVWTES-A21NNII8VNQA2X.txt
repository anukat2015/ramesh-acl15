Title: Worked great for 4 years until .....
Content:
I've loved this coffee maker; for four years we've awakened to delicious hot coffee. I love the programmable function.  It IS loud, but now we don't need an alarm clock. And it's messay, cleaning out the grinder can be a pain. All in all it was worth it until ... TONIGHT! I pour water in the reservoir to set up the machine for tomorrow's brew and it immediately starts pouring out the bottom! We can't figure out where it's coming from. Everything has been fine until now. I was wondering if anyone else had this problem.

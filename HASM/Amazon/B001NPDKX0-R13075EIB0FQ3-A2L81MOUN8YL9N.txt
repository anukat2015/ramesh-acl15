Title: A LARGE MACHINE
Content:
The HP is a monster. At 18.5" what does one expect. My 70 year old eyes don't see so well any more and I have no need to drag this thing on airplanes.The screen display on DVD or fish screen saver is great.I want to reach in, pull out a fish and throw it in a pan.
 I have personally built 25 desktop computers for my self and friends, but this is my first laptop.You can't build these at home. you know.
I like the machine, but I don't like VISTA, and the 64 bit operating system has rendered some of my system related programs, like Partition Magic useless.
I don't like the outside appearance,would have liked a color choice, but I am a FUNCTION guy.   YES,I would buy again but wish it was in purple!!!!!!
I don't deal with Amazon much, however service was great. In addition, free shipping, no tax, WHAT A COUNTRY!!!!

Title: Faulty image sensor.
Content:
When I first received my t1i it wasnt packaged very well, there was a lot of room in the box and on the top of the box the one and only layer of tape was broken. Now I'm not entirely sure if it was because of the poor packaging or because of faulty hardware but the camera didnt work properly. the easiest way to explain the fault was it looked like a dead pixel on an iphone or lcd monitor except for it was redish/orange square. it was on every video I captured. had it for less than a week sent it back yesterday.

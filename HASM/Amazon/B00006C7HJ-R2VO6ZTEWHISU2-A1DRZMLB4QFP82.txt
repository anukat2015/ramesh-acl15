Title: Vornado VH2 Vortex Heater
Content:
Vornado heaters have a reputation for superior performance, heating an average size room well through convective rather than radiant heat, doing so quickly and quietly and leaving few uneven spots. This unit is no exception. However, it developed a rattle in the fan within two weeks. Although it did not affect performance, it quickly became annoying. To their credit, Vornado sent me a prepaid shipping label to return the unit for repair under warranty, all shipping paid. However, their customer service did not respond promptly to my email, and I had to contact them by telephone to get my shipping label. My overall experience with Vornado products leads me to continue to recommend them with the caveat that they may be subject to some minor quality issues.

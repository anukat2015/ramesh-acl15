Title: Man's best friend!
Content:
Having a Border Collie and 2 house cats, we have battled pet hair forever.  Our new vacuum is doing an outstanding job cleaning up this problem.  It is important to read all the instructions about maintaining the machine to provide optimum performance.  I find this a very small time investment to maintain the suction power, brush action and cleanliness of our carpets and furniture.  The attachments work extremely well.  We have been amazed by the amount of debris with which we have been living.  The vacuum is very rewarding to use!

Title: Great camera for the price!!!
Content:
I have the Pentax K2000 which is a NO nonsense No frills DSLR camera. It takes outstanding photos!!!!...That's what it was made for!...No video...Just photos!!!...I made the upgrade to the new Pentax KX about a month ago & couldn't be more pleased!!!...This DOES do video!!!...720p High definition!...This has Live View & Orientation Sensor!...Still....like my K2000...it does what it actually made for....It takes EXCELLENT photos!!!!....I always am sort of skeptical when a camera has too many "Bells & Whistles"....I always think of that as a gimmick & that it will take away from the ability to shoot good photos.  That's why I originally bought my K2000 last year. Because it was designed to be a VERY nice DSLR camera made for taking photos...Which it does VERY well...After reading a LOT a reviews...I decided to buy my KX...AGAIN...I am very PLEASED....I am more concerned about quality photos than anything else on a digital camera & it takes very nice photos!...Of course, if you are a "novice", you will have to learn about different settings on a DSLR to get different results...I never really used the video on any of my cameras....I have a camcorder for that...but....I must say that I am impressed by the video on the KX also...I bought this on AMAZON for a very good price...I've tried other "Name Brand" cameras costing up to $250.00 more. I am VERY glad that I stuck with Pentax!!!!!!

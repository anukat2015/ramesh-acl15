Title: Neat Coffee Maker
Content:
Overall I really like this coffee maker! The stainless steel carafe is great! I only wish that the heating plate remained on for 10-20 minutes or so after brewing. It turns off right after the brewing is done. Which is a bit annoying especially when I set the timer for morning brewing and I'm running late. Plus, the "alarm timer" is called "delay" or something like that. Why not just call it "alarm" or "timer?"

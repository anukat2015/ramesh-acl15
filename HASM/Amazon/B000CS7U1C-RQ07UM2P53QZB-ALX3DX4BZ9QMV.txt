Title: Too Sensitive-Not a good buy
Content:
I purchased this product two weeks ago and I am ready to send it back packing. I am a former IPod user and wanted to try something new since my Ipod is no longer functioning. The Zen is a nightmare. The touch pad does not work properly, it takes you all over the place when touched slightly. The wheeled version of the smaller Zen's are much more functionable. I've already done a firmware download for the touch pad and it still does not work properly (and I've only had it for 2 weeks). This product is still in the testing stages and needs major revamping. 
The graphics and sound are great. Finding radio stations and saving them as presets has not worked for me, and I've tried it several times. There are just a few pros about this product, but many cons.
Creative should do a recall on this product, work out the kinks and then re-market.

Title: nice little heater!
Content:
I bought this unit specifically bcoz it has a thermostatic control.  I am not so sure it raises the temp to the exact temp that it states on the top, but just the same, I like that it shuts off by its self when it does reach a certain degree.  I had a unit before that just ran all of the time, which worried me and sometimes made the room I was heating feel like a boiler.  I use this heater for a small bathroom that sits off a garage, and it does great.  My mother has a different model by the same maker and I was at her house to use it this passed weekend.  Her's worked great as well and I feel confident to say that this manufacturer makes good stuff!!!

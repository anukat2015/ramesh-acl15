Title: Netbook or Notebook? Rose by another name!
Content:
Technically a Notebook according to Intel and Microsoft, but priced like a Netbook.  Intel and Microsoft won't allow more than 1G DRAM and 160G of HDD in a Netbook and they MUST load Windows 7 Starter and they MUST have an ATOM.  
If it is a "Notebook", based on a Celeron, there aren't any restrictions and they are ALLOWED to pay extra and load Windows 7 Home.  In this case, it looks like Acer made a great deal on Win 7 Home and the Celeron big  brother to the ATOM.  Plus it has just enough better graphics to run Win 7 home.  Most ATOM 270 or 280 units don't have the graphics strength.
Maybe it's just marketing on Intel's part, but look up the ATOM and Celeron family trees in Wikipedia to better understand what is going on here.  
This is a rose by another name and such a deal!
Another option is the Acer AS1410-2285 which has a dual core Celeron but a 160GB hard drive instead of 250GB. It's a trade off, but either is a good buy vs. the typical netbooks that are available with Win 7 starter.  The Acer units have twice the DRAM, a little bigger screen, a "real" Win 7 O.S. and much better graphics than any of the similarly priced netbooks.

Title: Great vacuum, great price!
Content:
We had company visiting for the weekend, and I was in desperate need of a vacuum ASAP.  I have 2 cats - one being long haired, and after much research at Amazon, I decided on the SmartVac for $175.  After 5 unsuccessful attempts to various stores looking for this magic machine, I purchased the Eureka Uno.  I won the lottery!!  Not only did I pay less, but the vacuum performs miracles.  I have a small loft apartment, and I swear I could make 4 cats with the hair it picked up.  My boyfriend and I continue to be amazed.  The pet paw is OK, but since the vacuum cleans to the edge of the walls, I did not even need it.  Buy this vacuum, and you will not be sorry!

Title: Incredible for dog hair on carpet and furniture!
Content:
I LOVE this vacuum. First, I bought it directly from Amazon for $143 with free shipping; it arrived in two days - WHOA! (Ordered Thurs, came Saturday at noon). I had just vacuumed with my old vacuum, which like every other vacuum I've had, was a hand-me-down. I was astonished at how well this vacuum worked. Its suction was intensely powerful, and I plan to keep it that way by frequently emptying the collection bin and maintaining the filter. The vacuum took approximately 6 minutes to assemble - 3 screws total ... it was so easy, especially for someone who didn't realize it would require assembly. The vacuum has a special accessory that flips down in front of the main part of the vacuum that touches the floor. The accessory is a rough fabric-type lint brush that grabs any lingering fur when you pull the vacuum, and then all the fur on the lint brush is sucked up when you push the vacuum back. It's really cool, haha, I love it! I used the accessories to clean my sofa, which was disgusting with fur. The turbobrush is really great at getting all the fur off of flat surfaces, but for crevices you really do need to use the crevice tool. Anyway, I think this is the best vacuum I've ever owned. It was entirely worth the $140 I spent ... just incredible value and quality. As other reviewers said, it is a little heavy but by no means unmanageable.

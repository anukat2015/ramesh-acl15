Title: Confused coffee consumer questions comments
Content:
I don't understand why this coffee maker gets such high marks from other reviewers.  First of all, the heating element is not very effective, so that first cup of coffee is neither hot nor strong.  Also, the machine is almost 100% plastic, making the unit feel cheap and flimsy.  The filter holder is hard to open and cannot be slid in place if the carafe is on the warming plate already.  These flaws earn 1 star in my book.

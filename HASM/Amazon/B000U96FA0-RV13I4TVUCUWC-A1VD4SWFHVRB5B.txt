Title: LASKO 5465  BEST HEATER!!!!
Content:
I bought it and love it.
Sleek stylish, quiet and puts out a lot of good heat.
And because it is up off the floor you can put it by where you sit in your Lazyboy and it will heat you instead of just heating the room.
The whole top part of this heater ocilates and is smooth and quiet.
The digital thermostat is great to.
I also like the remote that controls all of the functions of the heater.
If there cons I haven't found them yet.

Title: it's not broken but it keeps falling apart
Content:
The long tube that's supposed to nest into the longer bits of the tube or the attachments does not fit well enough.  During ten minutes of vacuuming, I probably have to pick up falling pieces about three or four times.  The two attachments (a brush and angled-looking thing) also fall off (as does the head of the vacuum) and do not fit easily back into their holding place in the canister.  The canister doesn't roll so much as gets dragged behind you since it constantly flips onto its side.  The vacuum also takes up a surprising amount of storage space since the tube loops out from the body.  In addition, the vacuum is difficult to get in and out of storage because the tube merely rests in place so it gets easily knocked over. There is also no good way to carry the vacuum when not in use.  I really really really hate this vacuum.

Title: Great Entry Level DSLR - Look At K200D - Recommended
Content:
We have used the "Pentax K100D" for almost two years now and have been very pleased with the ease of use, quality of images, and great selection of accessories. One of the biggest selling points was the compatibility with my large collection of "K-Mount" lenses and macro photography equipment from my ME-Super 35mm days.
The K100D is a fairly small DLSR and is great for people with smaller hands (like my wife). 
I really like that the anti-shake is built into the camera, allowing all of my old lenses to take advantage of the feature!
The 18-55mm lens that was paired with the camera is very good quality and worth the extra money.
Be advised, there is a newer Pentax camera out, the Pentax K200D 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens that replaces this model and could be worth a look.
Overall, recommended!

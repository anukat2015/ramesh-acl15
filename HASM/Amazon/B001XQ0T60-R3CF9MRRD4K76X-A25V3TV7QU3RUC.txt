Title: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
Content:
This electric fireplace/heater was great until it completely fell apart under its own heat. It lasted about 2 or 3 weeks and then I noticed something looked wrong. I opened the door to investigate and the back plate had fallen forward. When I opened the door, the door is connected to a side plate and the whole thing just came off. When I looked at what had happened, I realized that underneath the exterior which is made to look like metal there is this stuff that looks like recycled cardboard. The heat just broke it down. And it just tore loose. When I tried to turn it over to find the serial number which the seller had requested, the fake logs that were on the bottom fell out. The whole thing just seemed to disintegrate from its own heat. The seller was decent and gave a refund and they will make the effort themselves of dealing with the manufacturer who did not readily respond. I have been buying through Amazon for over a decade and have never had a bad experience before. I have never had to return anything before. This is a completely defective product. I would not have given it one star but that is the lowest rating allowable.

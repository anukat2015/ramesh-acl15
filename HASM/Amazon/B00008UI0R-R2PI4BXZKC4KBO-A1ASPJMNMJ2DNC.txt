Title: loooooove this vac!!
Content:
this is a great vacuum.  i own a cleaning business and i have clients with dysons, kirbys, electrolux, miele - and only the miele is better than mine - but mine is  about $1,100 less than the miele, so i'll take it!  it's lightweight enough to carry up and down the stairs and it will suck anything at all up!  I bring it to all of my cleaning accounts, it has been used in 2-3 homes a day for over a year now and it's still going strong!  looooove this vac!

Title: odor
Content:
This heater looks great, has all the features you could want, and heats up a room fast. The only problem is the odor! Has anyone else noticed this odor? When I removed it from the box there was a powerful chemical odor. I ran it for about four hours to see if it would dissipate, but it didn't. Is this a common trait for ceramic heaters, or should I return it? It's not a burning odor.

Title: First DSLR, great value.
Content:
This was my first Digital SLR camera so I spent some time researching it and other Sony models and Comperable Canon and Nikon models.  
I think the A300 is a better value because it comes with a better lens than the new models (like A330 and A380).  On the A300, the standard lens is 18 - 70mm while on the A330 & A380 you get a 18 - 55 mm lens.  The only advantage of a 330 or 380 is they come with an HDMI cable so you can see the pictures on your TV.  You get an RCA cable with the 300.  But this is for still shots only as these cameras do not take video.  The 380 has a 14MP resolution, so it is a little slower 2.4 frames/sec vs 3 frames/sec).
I prefer the 300 over the Nikons and Canons because of the lower price (about $100 less) and also because it is easier to use and has some more features like the ability to shoot through the LCD or viewfinder, the steady shot (in camera, not lens), 3200 ISO and the tiltable LCD screen so you can take pictures while holding the camera overhead or low to the ground.

Title: A must for pet owners
Content:
Our 19 year old Rainbow SE has never let us down.
Every time we use it we are just amazed (and disgusted)at the removed crud and hair we were previously ignoring and living with. 
It has never leaked, fallen apart, etc. 
Cleaning it is not exactly fun but would you rather have that stuff in your house or dumped elsewhere?
I'm currently replacing the belt for the power nozzle for only the second time since new.
If some owners had problems with their unit they should have had them fixed under warranty(ours was 3 years).

Title: 5 stars...for now(ipod noob)
Content:
I've had the 160g since the second week after they came out,didn't actually open the box till 2 weeks ago.I've been busy.So far I've been pleased with the ipod;all I've had before this for portable music were a few tape walkmans,then a basic discman,then a sony sport discman,and then the sony sport minidisc player.I've been using my minidisc player since at least '02,and wanted to wait till the ipods had enough capacity to let me have all my songs on it at once.Having to sit around re-recording minidiscs every 6 months to keep things fresh was a weekend-long chore,and I wasn't about to get an mp3 player that I'd have to do the same with.So I just went out and got the new big one so that I wouldn't have to worry about wasted time.Good thing I didn't fall for apple's sale involving getting rid of all the old 80g vids for practically the same price as the new,bigger one;apple's weak in that respect.That shouldn't be news to most.
It took me 5 hours to synch 92.87 gigs of music onto it,which was tedious,but I waited and it got done.Then the ipod screen pops up and says that I only have 148 gigs total."Kinda weak" I thought,but whatever--it's still a s___ ton of space.Then I tried throwing a few videos I had sitting around in a folder onto itunes and find out that it has to be in apple's format.The run-around begins.I had some buddies on a message board help me out,found a program,and was able to change the vids after dinking around with it.It takes a long time to convert an hours worth of video to mpeg4 or whatever it is.After a few days I put a handful of vids on it.
So far it's gone about 10 hours off the first charge(1 hour of watching vids included)and the batt icon looks to be 1/4 down,so the 40 hour charge factor seems to be truth so far.
I think the sound's darn good,considering I've upgraded from a player that had songs in sony's atrac3 format.I haven't tinkered with the equalizer because I want the battery to last,but I might check it out at least.
The video surprised me on it.the colors are awesome and the sound from the vid source is great too.too bad it sounds like apple is scalping people on that "special" $50 peice of plastic cable that should be $5,though.one reason I got this thing was so that I wouldn't have to lug around my stupid dvd case to parties;I just wanna plug it in and have 10 or so movies at my disposal.Guess I'll be lugging it around until apple gets the idea and lowers the price.what were they thinking?!allowing any cable to work with the video feature's gonna cause a massive NEW wave of dvd piracy--nah,not a chance.they'd have to ban the internet for that.another capitalist,bold-faced lie that fills their pockets,eh?I wonder if legal action could take place if they didn't advertise the "cable issue"?eh,apple stinks.
it sometimes takes 3-4 tries with the usb to get the ipod to take a synch,but it's no biggie.
in a nutshell:while apple as a capitalist-pig company continues to hunger for ways to screw their loyal,but mostly blind,customers,the ipod has been awesome so far in my experience.the set-backs are few,and except for the cable issue I'm happy with my purchase.

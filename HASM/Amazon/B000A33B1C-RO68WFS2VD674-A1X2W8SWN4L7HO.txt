Title: Disappointed
Content:
I really, REALLY wanted to like this heater.  I had indended to use it in my son's bedroom.  I followed the instructions to "season" the heater and burn off the oil coating and cure the paint.  After over 12 hours of running on highest setting the fumes in the garage were intolerable.  Fortunately, Amazon has a superb return policy and back it went.
Look elsewear.

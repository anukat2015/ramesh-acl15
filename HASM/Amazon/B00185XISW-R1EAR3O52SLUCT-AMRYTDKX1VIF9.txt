Title: The economic is tough, and you wont have to break your wallet to heat up your bedroom
Content:
Like many I have a whole house force air system and it is never balance right.  Adding one of these really take the edge off the cold room. I have it for a week so far, it is so awesome.  I highly recommend a purchase of digital thermostat switch along with it too.  I also measured the electrical consumption using killawatt device... not bad at all, it really use less than 400watt of power... So I figures 8 to 10 hours a day, it will translates 5kw per day and in NYC, the per kw cost of electricity in winter time is about 10c... so.. about 50c top every day to heat up a room...it is not bad at all.

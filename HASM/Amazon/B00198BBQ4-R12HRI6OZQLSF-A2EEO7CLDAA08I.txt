Title: Stay far, far away from any DELL products!!
Content:
The first year is covered under warranty.  They happily replace anything that breaks.  My DVD/CD player and powercord broke in the first year.  No problem getting replacement.  Then the next year comes....and the power cord and DVD/CD player breakdown again.  I pay my $200 to replace it.  6 months later, the same product breaks down again.  I receive the DVD/CD player and it doesn't work.  And, the technical agent refuses to provide any assistance unless I fork out another $45.  When I spoke to the manager, she told me to prove that I have bought so many DVD/CD players, and if I can then they would help me for free.  So, I broke out all my receipts, and told her every order number.  Then, she refused to help me, and said I must pay $45.  They are just awful.  Their product stinks and the customer service stinks.  Go with any other brand than Dell.  This computer completely falls apart after 6 months.

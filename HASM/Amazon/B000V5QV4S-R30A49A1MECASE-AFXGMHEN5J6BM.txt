Title: Pleasurable Upgrade
Content:
After shooting for a short time with a Rebel 35mm film camera, I then decided to go the route of digital with various point & shoots. Finally, after only looking for point & shoots with manual controls, I went back and got myself a digital SLR in the rebel XT. It fulfilled my appetite for fully manual controls, but i still wasnt pleased with the size (i have rather large hands), weight, color (it was silver), or the ISO speeds and noise.
I didnt have much money and was trying to decide whether i should go with a used 30D or 40D. I read a lot of info here on Amazon and a few other places. I finally settled on looking at a used 40D. To my surprise there was a vendor here that sold the body for cheap because it was an open box. The body had never been used but the lens was missing from the kit. 
After receiving my 40D i couldnt have been more pleased. It was the right size and weight. Felt very well balanced in my hand especially with a large 70-200mm lens on it. My Rebel had felt toyish with that lens attached. The ISO speeds could go well over the 800 ISO i was used to with the rebel. I also dont seem to get as much noise at those high speeds. 
The live view is the feature that beat out the 30D, but i dont find myself using it that often. Id much rather just look through the viewfinder. 
Im also liking the large aperture wheel and its placement by my thumb. Much better than having to press a button while spinning the shutter wheel like on the rebel.
All in all this was a great purchase. I use the 40D almost daily. i cant get enough of taking such great photos with it. I recommend this to anyone who wants a prosumer grade camera...

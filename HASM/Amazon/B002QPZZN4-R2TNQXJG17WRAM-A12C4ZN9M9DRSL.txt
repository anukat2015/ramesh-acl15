Title: Amazing features for the price
Content:
I've had this computer for a couple of days now and it's great.  I recently bought an Acer Revo 3600 and liked it so much, when my laptop died I decided to check out their other products.  I bought it when it was $599 and couldn't find anything close to its specs (which I think speak for themselves) at that price point.  It worked right out of the box...no hassles whatsoever.  It's very fast, but then again I've been using a 4 year old Dell, and I really like Windows 7.  I would have given it 5 stars except for a couple of things that I find a bit annoying, but these are personal preferences.  The big thing is that because it has a numeric keypad, the keyboard is shifted awkwardly to the left.  The first 2 days I had it, I kept hitting all the wrong buttons, but I'm starting to get used to it.  Another is that the right and left click mouse buttons on the touchpad have been combined into a single bar (click on right side for right click, left side for left click).  It feels a bit stiff/hard to depress and, because of the aforementioned awkward shift, I frequently hit it too close to the middle which doesn't accomplish anything.  Also, the cover is very shiny and shows every fingerprint, but it's hard to find a laptop today that doesn't have this feature.  Overall, it's a great laptop.

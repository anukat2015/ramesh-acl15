Title: great product great price
Content:
I bought this (almost 2 years ago now) to use for my bedroom which never cools well in the Texas heat.  You do need to use ice if you want it to cool the room, adding water only just doesn't do enough to combat the heat.  But I run it at night and in the morning I can tell a noticable difference in the temp when i leave the bedroom.  For the price you really can't beat it. If you can afford to spend $500 on a portable air conditioner thats great, for the rest of us this is a great option  :)

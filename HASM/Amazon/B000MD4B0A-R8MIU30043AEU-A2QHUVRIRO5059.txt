Title: Worth Every Penny
Content:
This mini player is excellent. The sound is great. It is very easy to load songs. Upgrading the software was fairly easy after an extensive search for the website on which it was located. I have not been able to figure out how to convert the videos in to the format recognised by the player. However, I know that will eventually figure it out. The CD that came with the player does not have virtual dub mentioned in the user manual, I had to download it from the meizu website. The battery life on this player is excellent. I have no regrets purchasing this product. I would highly recommend it.

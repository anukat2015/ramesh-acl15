Title: Dirt Devil 082600 Vision--an amazing vacuum for the price
Content:
The Dirt Devil 082600 Vision Bagless vacuum absolutely rocks for the price.  Some features that hooked me are that it:1) sucks up dog hair from a rug with little effort (WOW!),2) comes with two heads (the one not pictured works the best) that are designed to allow the pole to go far under furniture, 3) allows for variable suction speed,4) has an extra long cord with auto rewind button, and5) glides easily around the house.What a vacuum!

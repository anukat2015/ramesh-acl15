Title: Great new iPod
Content:
This is my second nano, had the 2nd gen before this.  The picture quality is great and sound is what I would expect from Apple.  The only grip I have is the changes to the docking strip rendering previous charging adapters useless, but I would also expect that from Apple. Overall great product.

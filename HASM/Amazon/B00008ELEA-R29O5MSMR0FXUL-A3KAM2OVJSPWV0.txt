Title: Back to Basics
Content:
I have bought several coffee makers over the years including one of the fancy "1-cup, quick brew models" and I just couldn't seem to get a GOOD cup of coffee unless I went to Starbucks.. Then I remembered that my mother in-law had an old perculator coffee pot that made a perfect cup of coffee everytime, so I went in search of one and I came upon this one and I love it! I wish I had gotten the 12 cup, but didn't because it didn't get very good reviews, however 8 cups just isn't enough for my household so we end up making 2 pots, not a big deal because it does make a pot quickly. I also love that I have no filters to buy.

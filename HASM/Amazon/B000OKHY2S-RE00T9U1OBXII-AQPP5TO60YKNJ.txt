Title: it works
Content:
i just ordered another one. i live around the inland empire california where the humidity ranges from 27%-35% and temps of 78f-93f in the past few days indoors with no ac. it does not cool a room like a ac but it is cooler than using a fan. you have to be in front of the swamp cooler to feel the cool air and cools from 2f-10f depending on the environment. i put it right next to my bed and i get cold in the middle of the night. just make sure you have plenty of ice to add into the cooler.

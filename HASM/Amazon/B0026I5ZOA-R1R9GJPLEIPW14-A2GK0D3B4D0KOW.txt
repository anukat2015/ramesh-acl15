Title: Sony's bad repair service
Content:
The computer stopped working about a month after I bought it.  It took Sony more than a month to finally repair it.  The repair service was simply horrible - both slow, unreliable and incompetent. That combination is hard to beat. The computer is now working satisfactorily but after this experience I would not buy another Sony computer.

Title: ipod for my husband
Content:
I was very pleased with the quick shipping of this product. Amazon always does a great job. My husband travels a lot, and always seems to get stuck in airports for hours at a time. He has a 2GB MP3 player, but he wanted something bigger to hold a ton of music, so he doesn't have to hear the same song in one day. I bought the ipod to solve this problem. It's easy to use, plus with it's slim, design he can put it anywhere without being in the way. I was very pleased with the bonus we got through Amazon for buying it at that particular time. We received 5 bonus downloads of music for free! Amazon made shopping for Christmas this year so easy and hassle free. Thanks.

Title: works great on my hardwood floors
Content:
Originally, bought this the first time I saw it at Linens-N-Things, then decided to see if I could find it cheaper online. Cheapest I could find was the J&amp;R Music and Computer World price at Amazon, but when I read the customer review that said, despite its claims, it didn't actually work on hardwood floors, I decided I had better test out the one I'd already bought since ALL I have are hardwood (90%), vinyl, and a bit of ceramic tile.IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY ON MY HARDWOOD FLOORS, picked everything up, and I have not admittedly swept or vacuumed them since before Thanksgiving, PLUS I had just gotten rid of some cats, so there was litter to sweep up - just make sure the beater bar is turned off, but the suction is turned on (which it is not turned on out-of-the-box), either that or you have a defective product.On top of that, it's lightweight, swivels nicely, is quiet (as vacuums go), easy to lug about the apartment, has strong suction power, the bag appears to be easy to replace, and the attachments are fabulous - I actually prefer the smaller size. The trim around my floors is carved and caked w/years of re-painting; so, it was hard to clean them w/a rag - the crevice tool worked like a charm. I also cleaned a couch w/rather rough upholstery, two chairs w/smooth, silky upholstery, and a my computer chair with the upholstery attachment; as well as sweeping the window sills and attempting even to sweep the blinds with the dusting attachment. All of them rated 5 star in my book...So unless you are really super duper concerned w/all that HEPA filter jazz another reviewer was complaining about, I would highly recommend this product. I've used really bad, old canisters, and mostly used uprights, and this vacuum is the best - if you have hardwood floors the canister is the way to go, but, even on carpets, I think I would prefer this particular model to an upright anyday, which are generally heavy and clunky to lug around, in my opinion (I originally tested the floor model on the berber carpet at LnT and it worked very well there, too, but I couldn't say for higher/thicker/whatever carpets).

Title: SanDisk MP3 Player
Content:
Love the player. Very easy to use. I use it while working out and I like the way I can just clip it on to my shirt. Only thing bad is that the USB cable that came with it was defective - won't plug into the player - so unless you have a spare lying around (I did) the player is useless.

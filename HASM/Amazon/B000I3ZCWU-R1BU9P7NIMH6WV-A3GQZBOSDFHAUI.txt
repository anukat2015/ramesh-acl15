Title: NOT an upgrade
Content:
bought the Rebel XTI with 2 stabilizer lenses.  Everything works as advertised.  I am really disappointed in the quality of the pictures.  I have a couple other low end cameras that give me a sharper focused picture than the XTI.  I live on a hill overlooking a valley with Zion national park on the other side.  I love taking pictures of the sunrises over Zion.  Both my old Fuji S5000 and my Fuji F30 give me MUCH sharper images.  I have had it for about 6 months and a few thousand pictures, so I guess I'll just bite the bullet and start over.

Title: first dslr, best pictures ever
Content:
having enjoyed my vivitar point 'n shoot until it broke, I was searchng for a new camera. almost bought a Nikon, until I saw the A350, 14.2 megapixels WOW beats cameras costing more. I love macro photography. The standard lens it comes with I don't think I've used it more than twice. I gota TAMRON 70/300MM 1:2 macro lens. In just ten weeks I have taken over 5000 pictures. Some of the best pictures I've ever taken. My friends say so too. Sony's website is great for tutorials. I work with color and light all day, so I think I have at least a little leg up.  This camera takes a great leap up.  Read the manual well. I read it, went to take pictures and when something turned out wrong I'd go back to the manual to figure why. The clarity, sharpness of the pictures are incredible! Cons? none that I can think of !

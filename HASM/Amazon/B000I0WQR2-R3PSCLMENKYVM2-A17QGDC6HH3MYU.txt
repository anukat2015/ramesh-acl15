Title: Bad Odor
Content:
I should have known when I opened the box and saw a label on the main unit that says the heater smells. The sticker says to run it in a well ventilated area until the smell disappears. The smell is bad, kind of like hot plastic and hot oil, smells rather toxic. It does not smell like heated dust. I put it outside for 2 hours on the high setting and it still smelled horrible. My wife will not allow it in the house so it went back to Costco. Fortunately they have a generous return policy. If you think you might return it do not install the handle -- once installed it can not be removed.

Title: Great while it lasts!
Content:
We purchased our most recent Farberware percolator to replace one that no longer perked long enough (it lasted 4 years). We have used this same model coffee maker for probably 30 years (since Corning quit making their porcelain model). We have owned @ 8 through the years. and since first trying Farberware, have not used any other brand.  However, with each new percolator, we have found that their life gets shorter.  This latest machine quit this morning, after less than ½ year of service.  They make a great cup of rich coffee while they last but they are no longer the reliable appliance they once were.  We're going to try a Cuisinart and hope for the same great flavor of perked coffee plus greater reliability.

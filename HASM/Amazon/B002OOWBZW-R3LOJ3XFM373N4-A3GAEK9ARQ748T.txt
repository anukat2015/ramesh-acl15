Title: WARNING, do not buy from toshiba
Content:
Think twice before buying any product from toshiba.  I bought a laptop from them this summer, and within 3 months, it stopped powering on.  Per Toshiba's warranty, you MUST send it in to their "repair depot".  You cannot get it fixed locally unless you want to pay for it yourself. 
They promise a 7-10 day turn around, but it has now been at their "repair depot" for 10 weeks.  The "repair depot" has diagnosed the problem 3 times so far, and each time it waits on a part for an average of 2-3 weeks. If all the toshibas in the country come to a few centralized locations, wouldn't you have the parts in stock? Customer service is a call center in India where they read from a script and they are utterly worthless. You can call their "repair depot" directly but you will spend a minimum of an hour on hold.  They refuse to replace the computer or offer a refund. Their only response is "you just have to wait".  Their "case managers" say the exact same thing.  
This is not an isolated incident.  Toshiba's laptop forums are full of similar stories. Please save yourself the trouble and buy another brand instead.

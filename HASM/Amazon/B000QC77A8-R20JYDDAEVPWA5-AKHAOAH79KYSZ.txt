Title: Very pleased
Content:
I purchased this unit to use in a sun or utility room which is not well insulated. The unit it fairly quiet and does a good job of heating the space. The body of the unit does stay cool while the grill portion is warm to the touch when it is on. I keep it a couple off feet away from the wall and curtains just to be on the safe side. I am pleased with the performance of the heater and was surprised it warmed the room up so fast. As of yet I have not seen it take a huge bite of my electric bill.

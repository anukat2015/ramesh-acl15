Title: Just what I was looking for
Content:
Being from the Midwest, Chicago, I had low expectations for this purchase after reading the product description and due to the high humidity we have here, though I read the opposite somewhere too, that the product works well in humid environments.  I generally would rather do with only a fan all summer but sometimes it becomes unbearably hot.  This product breaks up the heat and creates a nice cool breeze and some much appreciated relief.

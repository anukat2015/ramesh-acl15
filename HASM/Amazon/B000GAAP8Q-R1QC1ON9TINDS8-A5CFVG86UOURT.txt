Title: ipod nano, what's next?
Content:
for a older man to use this product is amazing from a haunch that predated back in the early 70's.  back then, there was no walkman in the market and the small transistor radio has been around in the 50's. by then a small portable cassette tape decks were in the market. so the haunch that i was discussing with a friend is, " would it be nice in the future to have a pocket size 'thing' that can be carried around in your pocket with a headphone to listen to a recorded music?". my dream come true. it is small pocket size friendly, affordable, the headphone delivers good sound for its size, but the battery does not last long enough for a long trip.

Title: Rugged
Content:
I had an early iPod and liked it but the hard disk died out of warranty.  I learned that all the iPods (other than this own) use a hard disk.  This uses flash memory which makes it much more durable.  If you are running, biking or hiking with your player or if you're prone to drop it, consider the shuffle.  If it had a menu and allowed you to select songs individually, it would be perfect.

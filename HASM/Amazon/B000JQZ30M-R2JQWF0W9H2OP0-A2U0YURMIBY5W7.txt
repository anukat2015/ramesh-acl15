Title: Lasko Oscillating Fan
Content:
Adorable urn oscillating fan, toasts my entire 750 sq foot apartment to 70-74 degrees inside when it's in the single digits outside! Central heat rarely kicks on, and my heat bill has dropped dramatically. Loved it so much I bought one for both my daughter and my mother!

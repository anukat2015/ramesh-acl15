Title: worst vacuum, customer service non-existent!
Content:
I got this Shark Power Pet Cannister Vac to vacuum up cat hair from my wood floors and area rugs.  I will say, at first this vacuum did a great job.  Now it's two and a half  years later and this thing is nothing more than a sound machine.  I only have one short haired cat and she really doesn't shed that much, especially living in california.  So this vacuum, specifically designed to pick up pet hair, shouldn't have a problem vacuuming up her hair.  It doesn't vacuum up anything, it runs at a really high pitch, and then it shuts itself off because it gets too hot.  I have changed the filter on this thing and it didn't improve the situation.  I have sent an email to the company and no response.  I would not recommend buying this vacuum or any other product from this company, as its customer service is non-existent.

Title: Motor Blew After 1year and 1 month
Content:
I felt I had researched cannister vacuum cleaners well and settled for this Hoover. We loved the power of this machine. However, I bought this hoover at the end of 2006 and the motor died at the end of December 2007.  In a two family household this machine was not overtaxed.  It was my first and last hoover product.

Title: the bad reviews were right...
Content:
mine died tonight, after just a couple months' use - button you depress to brew a cup of coffee wouldn't go all the way down, and when i pushed it a couple times successively to try and start the unit a noxious, burning smell began to emit from the machine.  it was also extremely hot around the sides and back, and i unplugged it for fear the entire unit might catch fire given the burning scent coming from it.  now it's sitting on my counter, dead, with an email just sent to black & decker's customer service unit.  steer clear, the warnings on amazon were right...

Title: Bought iPod Classic 80G mainly for music
Content:
This is my first iPod and I am really amaged with my first experience with this highly successful & top rated product. I could add my entire 30 GB collection of mp3 music with all mp3 meta info (such as author, album, and art work). The display is very clear and unlike my other mp3 player (30 Gig Creative Zen which dis not display art work), it imported album art images from hard disk folders and displaying with fantastic colors and contrast when playing. Now I have more space, I added my entire collection of family digital photos. As a bonus it allows me to use it's huge remaining space as a storage to keep all my documents and excel sheets. With all these, it still is a thin and beautiful device. I missed this until now and unnecessarily struggled with other mp3 players.
Quite happy...

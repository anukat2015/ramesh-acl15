Title: For a small room
Content:
This heater sits in my computer room and quietly heats me and the room. No fan, just radiant heat. This heater is not for a large room. 8X10 is probably the most to expect. I have another heater that I used, but the noise from the fan got to me, hence I bought the Optimus. Another advantage is the long electrical cord. The outside temperature is 40° and my room is a very comfortable 70° and I will now set the heater to low setting.

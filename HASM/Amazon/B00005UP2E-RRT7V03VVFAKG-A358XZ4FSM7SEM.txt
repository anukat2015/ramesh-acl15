Title: DIRT DEVIL 082500 BREEZE BAGLESS CANISTER VACUUM
Content:
I LIKE THE DIRT DEVIL BREEZE CANISTER VACUUM VERY MUCH. IT HAS A VERY GOOD SUCTION. I HAVE BIRDS, AND IT MANAGES TO PICK UP THE BIRD SEEDS FROM MY RUG VERY GOOD, AND ON BARE FLOORS,  IT IS AN EXCELLENT PICKER-UPPER. HAS VERY NICE ATTACHMENTS. I CAN EASY MOVE THE CANISTER VACUUM--- LIGHT. AND ALSO, WHEN IN THE FUTURE, WHEN THE FILTER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, CAN GET FROM THE DIRT DEVIL COMPANY OR LOCAL VACUUM STORE. EASY TO GET IT REPLACED...AND DO NOT HAVE TO BUY BAGS FOR IT. THIS IS A GREAT FEATURE TOO.

Title: Very pleased
Content:
We have used Bunn coffee makers for several years, so when our latest machine died we started looking for a Bunn again.  After reading the reviews on this coffee maker, we decided to splurge and go "thermal".  We always have the coffee pot on at our house, and none of us like the taste of "old" coffee, so this coffee maker was a perfect fit for us.  It keeps our coffee hot for several hours (I have even made a pot late in the evening and it is still lukewarm in the morning), without any of that overcooked taste...in fact, a friend commented on what good coffee we made! We haven't had any problem with the carafe leaking unless we tip it too far at the end of the pot to try to get that last drop.  I found the lid to the carafe slightly difficult to put on, as it is making a seal while it is twisted on and I have a weak grip in one hand, but as long as I make sure the arrows are lined up correctly and turn it slowly I can manage it. We did have to order Bunn coffee filters in order to use our home ground coffee, although the standard grind Folgers did okay with a regular filter while we were waiting for our Bunn filters to arrive.  All in all, we are very pleased with our purchase!  For those who are not familiar with Bunn, though, just a word of warning...don't put the lid down until you have the carafe underneath! :-)

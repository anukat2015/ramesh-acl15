Title: No More Plastic Taste
Content:
I picked up this machine last month at my town Big Lots store for $17.99 (what a deal!). Before I paid for the machine I looked at the reviews right from my cell phone and I read lots of complaints about a funny plastic taste, because of the price I decided to give it a try. Once I got home I primed the machine following the instructions that came with it, and after brewing my first cup I almost spit it!! Disgusting plastic taste that ruined my French Vanilla flavored coffee. The next morning I brew another cup and the same, later I discovered that leaving the pod on the machine right after brewing my cup of coffee solved the problem. I did it for one week, brew the coffee in the morning before going to work and left the pod in the machine instead of disposing it right after, I'll leave the pod on the machine all day and remove after I returned from work. I guess that the coffee aroma stuck to the plastics parts on the machine, who knows!! Now I am enjoying the best coffee ever.

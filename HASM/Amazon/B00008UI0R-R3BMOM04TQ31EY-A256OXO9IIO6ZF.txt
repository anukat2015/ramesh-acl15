Title: Plastic Parts Should Last Longer Than 3 Years!!!!!!
Content:
I believe that a vacuum should work well for at least 10 years, like the ones I grew up with.  I just had to replace the telescopic wand on my Hoover at $81 for the wand and labor costs on top of that, totalling $112.  Hopefully the powerhead will be OK since that replacement cost $125.  That is about how much a a whole new model would cost.
This Hoover's plastic parts all cracked and fell apart after only about two years.  I put up with it by wrapping cable ties around everything for a year or more until the brush head started to work only intermittently, depending on which way I twistd the wand.  I simply can't believe that better plastic would increase the price by that much.  Our last vacuum (Kenmore# had the same exact problem and we lived with that one duct taped together for a long time, too, because we couldn't afford a new one.
I am now reserching Mieles and if my repaired vacuum shows even a tiny sign of not working perfectly, I will go out and pay the $500 for the Miele with a smile on my face!  Since we spent over $600 in the past 7 or so years on two frustrating American-made models, we might as well spend about the same for one with a 7 year warrenty.
In all fairness, I think that the suction is excellent and it does a great job cleaning #depending, of course, if your plastic has held together...and you hold the wand just so...).  I think the motor on this will last quite some time, but that is no good unless you've got the rest of it working!
I have just about lost faith in almost ALL American-made products!  
Thanks for reading my rant!  :)

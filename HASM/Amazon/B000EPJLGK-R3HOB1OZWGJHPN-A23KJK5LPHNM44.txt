Title: Shuffle, Nano and now Video
Content:
I bought a shuffle in September which is great for working out.  I bought a Nano in October which my wife "borrowed" so I bought the video IPOD in November.  I have had it for a little while and love it.  I am able to download my favorite podcasts much easier and the fact that I can listen to them whenver I want is great.  The ability to buy single songs that I like on Itunes without having to buy the entire cd is also great.  How often do you buy a cd and only listen to 1, 2 or 3 songs.  Lastly the video capability is great.  I thought the screen was going to be too small but after watching a couple of movies and videos I will always travel with it and leave the dvd player at home!

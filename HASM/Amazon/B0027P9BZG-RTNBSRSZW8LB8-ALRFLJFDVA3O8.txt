Title: Sony Vaio VGN_FW465J/B
Content:
After using this laptop for 60 days, my only negative comments are that the battery
runs out very fast and that the built-in speakers have poor sound. I love all the features this laptop has to offer. I used Sony tech support twice and was very impressed with their product knowledge and genuine customer concern and caring. If you are thinking of purchasing this model-consider the larger battery and perhaps a pair of external speakers.

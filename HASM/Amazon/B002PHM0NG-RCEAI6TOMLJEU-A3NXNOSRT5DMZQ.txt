Title: Good Choice For a Laptop
Content:
I bought this laptop in pink from Amazon for $730 in December.  I wanted a laptop for surfing the Net, watching videos and Hulu, and managing my pictures.  This is probably too much laptop for me, but I wanted Blu-ray and well as good sound.  My second choice was a Toshiba Timeline, which got good reviews except for the sound. I was also getting used to my husband's Mac and didn't want anything too "cheapy".  I've been very pleased.
The computer itself is great looking.  The pebbled metal doesn't show fingerprints.   I bought the pink because it was cheaper than the silver, but I am a fan of pink anyhow.  It's more of a silver pink, not an obnoxious pink.  It's not something, however, that most guys would want. (My husband leaves it alone.)
The graphics are great.  The keyboard is huge and took no getting used to.  The quick web access button is fabulous.  It gets you online in seconds. The computer is quiet, unlike our HP.  It also stays pretty cool, unlike my husband's Mac, which is a great thing since it usually sits on my lap. Most laptop bags don't fit this, so it took me a while to find one I liked.
The only negative is the poor battery life.  I only get about 2 hours and 15 minutes at best.  That isn't a big deal for me, but you'll probably want to pass on this if you usually rely on the battery.

Title: quiet perfect warmth
Content:
My computer desk is at my window where I there are drafts and when the central heating is cycled off I freeze.
I also wanted something with low wattage to save on electric plus not have to worry about it tripping the circuit breaker.  True I do not live in the frozen eastern parts of the country but it is still damp and cold here and this little heater makes me warm and toasty. In fact it warms up my entire room just fine. 
I am glad I did not listen to the bad reviews because I almost didn't buy it. 
No wonder the good reviews far outweigh the bad. This little heater at 400 watts packs a punch and the 800 watts makes it almost tropical. 
I don't think I could be happier or warmer.

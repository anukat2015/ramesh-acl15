Title: Amazon gets no more business from me
Content:
I pre-ordered a Canon 5D2 on September 17.
I emailed Amazon on October 25 asking about the camera's ETA.
Amazon replied with an apology and stated that they would upgrade my shipping to next day when the camera was received by Amazon and was ready to ship.  I clicked the link on their email saying that I was satisfied and that the issue was resolved.
Around a month later I received an email from Amazon stating that my order had been removed by Amazon because I had not responded to an email of October 18  stating that I had to give permission for the order delay or my order would be removed.
I NEVER GOT THAT EMAIL! So they removed my order because I never responded to an email WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED!
But notice that my email of Oct 25 was answered by Amazon with that apology and quick ship assurance which I approved of by clicking their acceptance link that the problem was resolved.
When I spoke to Amazon "customer service," they would not reinstate my order.  SO, they effectively made me put my name at the bottom of another merchant's waiting list two months after I had ordered the camera from Amazon.  If they cared about my business, they would have done right by me ... but they don't care. This can happen to ANY Amazon customer at any time.
Rest assured that B & H would NEVER do this to one of their customers, and that THEIR customer service doesn't consist of robots with heavy accents.

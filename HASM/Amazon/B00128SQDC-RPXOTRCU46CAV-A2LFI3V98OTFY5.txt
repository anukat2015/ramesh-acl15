Title: Returning a defective camera is a pain.
Content:
The only problem buying from Amazon is that if the product is defective the return process is difficult and you never get to actually speak to a human. I bought the Nikon D80 as a present for my wife. She decides to open the box and get the camera out the night before a big family event, to take pictures of everyone. Of course the camera doesn't work. So off to a camera store (the following Monday) to see if they can determine the problem. Seems the lens is defective but the body works fine. Of course the "authorised Nikon retailer" cannot return the product unless they charge me a fee. Since it is only the lens that is faulty one would think one could return only that part. Since there is no human interaction with Amazon we ended up shipping the entire package back to Amazon. So much for using a new camera. Now we have to wait 14-21 days before we even get a response from Amazon on the return. Then they will probably credit my card and I still won't have a camera. The lovely email they send does not even allow for any response. On the off chance you get a defective product better to buy from a local retailer in case you have a problem. You don't save that much with Amazon to offset the hassle if it doesn't work. Books are fine but don't do electronics.

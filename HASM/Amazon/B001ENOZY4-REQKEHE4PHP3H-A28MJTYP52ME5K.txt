Title: Nikon D90 Meets All Expectations
Content:
My previous digital camera was a Canon Powershot (an excellent little camera) which I've had for several years. Prior to my vacation to Colorado this year, I wanted to invest in a serious digital SLR. After studying reports, handling different cameras at the local retailers, and talking to acquaintances about their cameras, I decided on the Nikon D90 with the 18-105 VR kit lens. I also purchased the 70-300 VR zoom lens in anticipation of the wildlife that is prevalent where I was going. It took me a couple of days to become familiar with the features and capabilities of the camera, which are very impressive. The controls and menus are intuitive and the 3" Hi-res viewing monitor is a joy to work with. The results on the trip more than met my expectations. The vibration reduction feature of both lenses worked well and my hand-held shots were crisp. The one aspect of the purchase that is less than stellar is the Nikon software program supplied to organize and view the photos.

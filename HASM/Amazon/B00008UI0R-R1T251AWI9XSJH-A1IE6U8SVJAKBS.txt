Title: Average vac at great price
Content:
This is an ok vacuum. I have had it for a month - it works fine. However, it is only ok for the price, I have owned better vacs before. People who say it's light never had a nice vacuum - this thing is quite heavy, but not as heavy as uprights (those i simply hate as a kind). People who say its quiet, never had a quiet vacuum, however it is not as loud as most uprights are. It does pick up most of stuff, but you have to empty it so often it is annoying. And  I find the process messy - I live in an apartment and cant empty it in my backyard. That being said, this vacuum is better than most uprights, but it definitely not as good as some high-end canister vacs. It will ideal for small places, don't buy it if you have a 5-bedroom house. I will probably buy electrolux next time.

Title: Wow...I'm impressed
Content:
I did not expect this heater to work as well as it did. For the price this is pretty much a steal. This heater is being used in my little work area in a big open space studio. I keep it under the desk and within 2 minutes i'm already getting toasty and warm. A big plus for me was that this heater is super quiet. I hate loud electronics and find them annoying. This heater goes pretty much undetected. 
I'd give it 5 stars if it came with a remote control, but hey you can't get everything you want from something that cost you $20 bucks

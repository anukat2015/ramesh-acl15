Title: DeLonghi DFH132 Heater Not worth the price
Content:
First unit shipped didn't work. Amazon was awesome in dealing with the replacement. 
Good news I can share is that you can sit this little guy in your lap and won't get burned, on the other hand that's the only way you'll get warm. Placing the heater directly at my feet, under a desk, was fairly worthless. That was all I hoped for in a cheap and dimunitive space heater, but my expectations were apparently set too high.
My advice: if you think this might work for you, buy it from a supplier with a return policy just in  case your experience is as disappointing as mine. In all honesty I think my wife's hair dryer would warm my work space better. Some lucky person will inherit it at half-price when it finds its way onto a tag sale table next summer.
Guess I ought to mention that my first test drive of the heater was not in single digit temperatures. It was early September in the Catskills, with outside temp at 55 (F) and inside  my office, circa 65 (F). Save your money and just adopt a couple rescue dogs for the same amount of warmth.

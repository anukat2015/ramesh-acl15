Title: high pressure reg yes no claimed 1-60
Content:
i have a mr.heater and i needed a regulator, couldnt find the exact one. so i bought this one claiming 1-60psi. i hooked it up and found the knob spins but know regualtion. it seems to regulate about 40-60psi.  i opened the package so guess i cant return it . it appears it hasnt been dropped and i know i installed it correctly. i really needed a adjustable regulator i thought this was it. now im out 40 bucks and have a heater that still doesnt work.

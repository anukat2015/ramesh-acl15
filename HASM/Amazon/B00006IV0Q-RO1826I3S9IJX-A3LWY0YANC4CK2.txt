Title: Simplicity
Content:
I've used every type of coffee maker around.  I look for all stainless- that means NO plastic or aluminum contacting the water----this has been a great product for me--I love perked coffee.  When I'm not using this I use a Cona glass vacuum maker---  I'm a purist about materials and coffee making.  Presto has been the most reliable of all my electric percs. It's all stainless.

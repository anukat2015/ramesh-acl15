Title: Was nice while it lasted
Content:
Was great for 2 years and it just recently burned up. The thermostat dial melted and a there was a terrible burning plastic smell. It would not turn off. I guess the thermostat went bad. Too bad...I really liked it before that. Heated my bathroom during bathing time and didn't make the room too hot.

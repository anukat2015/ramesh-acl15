Title: Does exactly what it is supposed to do
Content:
I bought Mr. Heater for the cabin of our 26 foot sailboat and it works great!  I leave the hatch open a bit and the heater heats the cabin nicely.  Definitely better than the Coleman "Black Cat" that I previously used.  After only 3 years of service it completely fell apart, burned a couple spots in the carpet and made a mess all over the cabin.  Plus it does not have enough B.T.U.'s to heat the cabin of the boat sufficiently.  Mr. Heater does the job easily.

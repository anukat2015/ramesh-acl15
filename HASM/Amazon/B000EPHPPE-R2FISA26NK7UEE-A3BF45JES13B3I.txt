Title: Love My IPod
Content:
I bought an 80 GB IPod and I LOVE IT! I take it to the gym with me every day, and often use while I do housework and other activities. The best part, it only cost me about $300 buying it through amazon because I applied for a credit card and got $30 off my first purchase.

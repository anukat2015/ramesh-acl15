Title: Great Product
Content:
I love this little laptop.  It plays movies, great battery power, and Windows 7 is a hit.  You may have to update the network driver is using a linksys router.  i had problems connecting my wireless until the update.  Besides that is a great buy.  I ordered 4gb's of RAM too.  Very fast.

Title: The worst computer!
Content:
I purchased this laptop a couple of months ago. It didn't come with any instructions, manuals, suggestions, etc.  The worst of all is that it crashes constantly!  It took me 10 minutes just to bring up this website because of the crashing.  The computer has a diagnostic testing to check why websites can't come up, but there is never a resolution.  It has the slowest system; and no, it is not my internet connection (we have other computers in the house.  I am finally writing this out of frustration because I couldn't log into a website I use every day, because of some error or computer crashing.  My husband and I both are ready to throw this one out the window, considering we primarily use this for the internet.  I wish I sent this one back!!!

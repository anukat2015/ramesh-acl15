Title: Amazon Great - Toshiba not so much
Content:
This laptop is everything that the other reviews said that is; nevertheless, I happen to be part of the statistic of malfuntioning units right out the box.
Windows froze three times during the starup process; then, after two long hours of executing its own repair tool, Windows came back and booted without a problem.
After transfering the information from my old PC (seamless process) it asked me to reboot to finish the process; this was the begining of the end.
The computer then tryed to boot for more than one hour over and over and over again; no success. I chose to run the repair tool from Windows again; and after two or three hours it finally booted properly.
At this point I have already set up the return with Amazon; who knows? maybe it is a Toshiba issue, maybe it was a Windows 7 issue; quite honest, I don't care; This is one the most frustrating experience ever. I'm getting a Mac.
As a side note, Windows XP was without a doubt the last efficient and easy to use operating system in a PC.
UPDATE*****I bought a 13 inch MacBook Pro; guys, this is not even a discussion, there is no place for Windows anymore. I have used Windows and PC for more than 15 years, back in the days of 3.1; all of my life was stored and written in Windows and it took me less than 48 hours to IMPROVE my lifestyle with a MAC. Again, no discussion, the Apple experience is flawless.
Good luck dealing with your sound issues and your greasy fingerprints, and of course, with the Windows nightmare.

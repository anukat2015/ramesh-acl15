Title: Great value. A lot for the money.NV7920u
Content:
I have had this laptop for over a week now. It offers a lot for the money. The i5 seems to fly. I am at a hotel now and it got onto there WI-FI with no problem. I could have saved $120.00 by not getting the blu-ray but now I am more up to date. The screen is so big and clear I see no reason to ever buy another desktop model. This is more than enough computer for what I use it for. I think the person before me must have gotten a defective Gateway. It is too bad for Gateway that their help and support people did not take care of him like Amazon takes care of their customers.
I have an eight year old Gateway and I hope I have as good luck with their new company and product as I did with the old one. If I have a problem with this one I will come back with another review and let you all know. Their support may hurt them in the long run.
 I cannot say enough good about the customer support, speed of delivery and courtesy of Amazon. SUPPORT is why people come back.

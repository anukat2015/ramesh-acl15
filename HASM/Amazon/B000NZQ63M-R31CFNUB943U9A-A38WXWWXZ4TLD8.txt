Title: The end is near for "compact" digital cameras.....
Content:
Nikon D40 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-135mm Nikkor Zoom Lens.
For $660 it's hard to beat the photo quality of the camera, and the range of the zoom lens.  In dSLR usage, the lens is 27-202mm (1.5x focal factor), very wide to medium telephoto.  The camera is insanely fast and very easy to use, and with a lens like this, you don't need to carry another lens around.
Thank you Nikon.

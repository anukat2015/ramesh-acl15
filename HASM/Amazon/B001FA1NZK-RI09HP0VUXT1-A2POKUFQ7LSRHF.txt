Title: Whoa!
Content:
This is a pretty awesome unit.  I have never seen a teenager so thrilled with her new Christmas present.  This unit has oodles of features and works really well, once you figure out how to get the software interface to work.  It's 'only' got 8 Gigs -- too bad Apple can't resist ripping you off price-wise and give you 16 gigs for that price.  But then again, they don't have to; 8 Gigs is enough for most people, the other features work flawlessly and these things are reliable.

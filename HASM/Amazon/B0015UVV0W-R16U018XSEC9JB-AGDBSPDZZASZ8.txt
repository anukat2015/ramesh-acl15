Title: Burning smell
Content:
This space heater worked great for last winter. This year, I turn it on and it almost immediately sets off my fire alarm. There was a scary burning smell. I've found that the smell doesn't happen when the heater in is "low" mode, but then my room heats up very slowly if at all. Plus, I am nervously smelling the air every five minutes. Also, the room temp always stays at 65 even when my room is definitely colder.  This means that the heater will shut off before you want it to. This product was way too expensive to only work for one season (I live in Los Angeles, so it wasn't even used very heavily), and life is way too short for possible fire hazards. I would not recommend it.

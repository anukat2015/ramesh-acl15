Title: works great
Content:
I pretty much agree with most of the reviews that I read before buying this vacuum.  It cleans very well - MUCH better than my old one.  The container that gathers the dirt is a bit small - I need to empty it once for about every 15-20 minutes of vacuuming.  Overall a good buy.

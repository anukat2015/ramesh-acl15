Title: Great canister vacuum cleaner for the price
Content:
For the money (paid $80) this is a high quality product: modern design with decent suscion power, powerbrush, compact, quality product. Easy and convenient to use in a smaller place or as a second vacuum cleaner. It uses reusable bags if you do not want to invest in (pricey) paper bags. Thumbs up to Sanyo. Buy with confidence.

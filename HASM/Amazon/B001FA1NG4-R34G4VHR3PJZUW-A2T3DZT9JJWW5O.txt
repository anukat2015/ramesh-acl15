Title: Great product, but some people are real idiots
Content:
some people are real idiots. they buy tons of music off itunes etc. for about 1$ a song. you should download Frostwire (it's free) and you can download as much music as you want and not pay for it (unlike Limewire where u only had a couple gb of downloading). 
Overall, the iPod was great,  love it. For people who have a lot of music (5000 songs+)and are planning to get more, then you might want to consider the 16gb so that in the future, if you exeede the limits of the 8gb, you don't have to waste your money if you want to upgrade to the 16gb.

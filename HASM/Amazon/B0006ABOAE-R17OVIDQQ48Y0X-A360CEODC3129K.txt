Title: You Get more than you pay for
Content:
The Mr. Coffee ECM21 is a great deal.  We have had the unit over a month and use it daily and occassionally twice a day.  Some have commented how cheaply made the unit is - if you want a $500 to $2000 Stainless Steel unit than don't buy this Coffeemaker combo.  This unit fits nicely on our small counter, a major factor in the decision to buy the Mr. Coffee machine.  Some have complained that the unit doesn't make hot espresso; I have found that by starting the steam with the frother and then switching to the espresso maker that the espresso comes out very hot.  The frother is simple to use and easy to clean.  A final point of praise is the small pot setting. With other coffee makers, making only 2 to 4 cups of coffee resulted in weak coffee, not the ECM21.  I would rather buy 4 of these units than 1 expensive unit.

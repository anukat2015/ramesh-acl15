Content:
We purchased the EdenPure 1000XL directly from the manufacture, BioTech Research (Canton, OH).  It took twice as long as we were told to arrive and the remote did not work right out of the box.  Within five days the unit started turning off and not coming back on despite waiting for hours and room temperture dropping to the point the propane furnace came on.  
In order to get the unit to restart I had to turn the "power" button "off" and unplug the unit for anywhere from 5-20 minutes before plugging it back in and turning it on.
Only after our experience did I look further into online reviews of EdenPure products which are not favorable. I also checked into BioTech Research (Canton, OH) through the Ohio Better Business Bureau and saw that BioTech has had numerous complaints from customers with similar problems.

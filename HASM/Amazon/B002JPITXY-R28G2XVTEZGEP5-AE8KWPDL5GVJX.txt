Title: A Music and Video Device
Content:
I would like to make clear that I bought the Zune for music and video purposes, Thats why I love it,
before buying it, I tried the Software which is far better than Itunes, Zune Pass great deal for music 
lovers, the device itself is beautiful, If you are looking to fill your Zune with Apps go buy yourself an
Itouch, Internet? buy a Laptop, This is a device to enjoy your personal music while on a trip, jogging etc.
I compared both devices and I went with the Zune because its just simply better for my needs, by saying this 
Im expecting to help finishing endless debates about Itouch or Zune, It all depends to people's need.
In terms of sound Zune rules by far, but dont use the provided earphones.
Display is crisp.
Finally, Im hoping MS delivers a higher capacity Zune, but Im very please with my purchase.

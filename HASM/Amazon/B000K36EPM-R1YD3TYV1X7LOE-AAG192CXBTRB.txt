Title: Worst coffee maker ever
Content:
I bought this coffee maker about 2 years ago, and it stopped pumping water through the coffee. I bought another one (because I liked the design... stupid reason) and have had it for a week and it's doing the same thing. I'm going back to Krupps or Cuisinart.

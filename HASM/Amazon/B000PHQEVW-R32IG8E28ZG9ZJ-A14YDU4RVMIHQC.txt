Title: mediocre
Content:
It didn't cost much, and holds plenty of material. 
Navigation is difficult without some sort of display. And I can't get the controls to work the way I think they ought to work. I downloaded a 30-minute podcast, and found something interesting in the last 5 minutes. When I went back to find it, I wanted to skip to the end, and then scan backwards to the interesting part. But, from the end of a recording, holding down the "back" key seems to take it to the beginning of the first file in the directory. 
Also, it's really, really, quiet. I've got it plugged into the Aux channel of my Scion's stereo, which was designed to accept an MP3 player. With the radio at max and the headset volume at max, I can usually hear the recordings fairly well. But, of course, when I put a CD in the player, I'm blasted out.

Title: Wasted $100
Content:
This machine was a waste of money. I received this as a gift to replace an old Mr. Coffee. The first one was mailed here-ordered from a retail company. It arrived with a broken carafe.  The company we ordered it from tried to find a replacement but gave up and suggested we just return the entire thing.  They sent us a new one at no charge.  
It worked great- for about four months. Then it began leaking badly-coffee maker side.  The company help line was constantly busy.  After a couple weeks we gave up and my husband took it apart and fixed the leak as best he could. We discovered the internal parts are quite delicate.  It worked again with lots of careful treatment for a couple weeks and then died completely.
After a couple months I gave up trying to reach the company and have simply resolved to not purchase DeLonghi anymore.
Compare this to our Mr. Coffee we had to put back into service-it still works and is ten years old. My parents have had a cuisinart (thermal carafe) for a couple years. They bought us one. I am skeptical of anything other than the standard brands at this point so we will see. Plus no expresso:(.

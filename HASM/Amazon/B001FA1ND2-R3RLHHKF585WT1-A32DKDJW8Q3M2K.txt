Title: Awesome Deal
Content:
Guys,
This is my first ever Mp3 player . I went with Apple because of the brand. This particular model because back is my color and sleek looks stylish.
Now the reason I got it through Amazon is for this is the cheapest you can get the model. Purchased it a month back for approx 135$ ( Apple store cost $150) 
I am not much of a 3rd party buyer, but since Amazon was the seller I did not have much doubts
Neat packaging and model arrived in perfect shape
Caution :I am yet to explore all its features . Know that a lot of people had trouble with shuffle , I just turned it off
So enjoy your music..and keep rocking!!

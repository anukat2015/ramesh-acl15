Title: This is a pretty reliable heater, with one small problem.
Content:
So I've had this heater for about two years now and it still works pretty well. It's able to heat a small room nicely. 
The only problem I've had with this heater began a month or two ago. The heater would shut off one minute after I turned it on. I thought the heater was broken, but it turned out the heaters had too much dust covering the fan's vent. All I had to do was vacuum out all of the dust and now the heater works as good as new. The only annoying thing about vacuuming the dust was that I had to actually open up the bottom of the heater to get out all of the dust, but otherwise the heater has been pretty reliable. Reliability is important to me. I had a DeLonghi Mica Panel Radiator HHP 1500 space heater that cost three times as much as the Honeywell HZ-2200 Mini Tower Surround Heater and broke after one year; so having a heater that can actually stand the test of time is really important to me.

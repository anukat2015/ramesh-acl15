Title: Few small buggers, but many, many great features!
Content:
Great little player!  Ive had mine for a few weeks now and it has not given me any trouble at all! It works well with MP 11, but, since Im more for the "drag and drop" method, I dont use it in conjunction with MP.  The CD it comes with is basically not needed, except to save as a back-up for future use (my computer, XP Pro- MC Ed, read the device immediately).  
When you connect it, you can simply drag music files from your hard drive to the folder in its directory labeled "Music".  It's all very self-explanatory.  The menus within the player are also very easy to understand once you get the hang of it (which would not be very long at all).  If you don't believe 8 GB is enough, there is an expansion slot for s micro SD card (for up to 2 gb more).  
It isn't very hard to view outside all the time. In direct sunlight is is difficult, but in the shade or on a cloudy day, the screen is still at least somewhat viewable. I was actually surprised! Battery life is great, as well.
Of course, as with many electronics, there are some very small inconveniences with this player. The side buttons, which are ">>" and "&lt;&lt;" can be kind of hard to press, I have to use my fingernail sometimes, but many may find this a very small issue. Also, the start-up time when you turn it on, takes about 15-20 secs (a very familiar issue with SanDisk products). 
 
There is no AC charger included (charges via USB), but there are some available via this site for next to nothing...literally.  Also, other accessories for this, though not available in most stores, are not hard to find here, either.
All in all, a great product for the price!

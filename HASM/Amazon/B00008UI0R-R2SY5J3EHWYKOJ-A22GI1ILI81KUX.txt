Title: Hoover Windtunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vac 3765
Content:
It's a great vacuum.  I just wish the warranty was longer.  My vacuum is 11 months old and I'm having to take it in for warranty repair.  I guess I should be glad it's not over one year old.  Anyway, I tried several vacuums, even the Dysons.  This vacuum surpasses all of them.  I have hardwood and tile with area rugs in our main floor and our upstairs is hardwood in hall and master, tile in one bath and carpet in the kids and guest rooms.  Anyway, this vacuum does fantastically on all floor surfaces.  I cannot believe how much stuff we pick up every time we vacuum.  I now know that we were probably filling vacuum bags every time we vacuumed, when we had bagged vacuums.  Anyway, if you like a canister, this is the way to go.

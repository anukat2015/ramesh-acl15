Title: Not worth it!  Flaw in the latest models
Content:
I had one of these a few years ago and it worked great! It lasted for a couple of years.  But, last month I decided to go back to this model because I missed the convenience of not having a carafe and it was horrible from the start.  The annoying "Cln" started flashing 4 days after I bought it.  I followed the instructions on cleaning the item and it wouldn't stop flashing that it needed cleaning. I reset it by un-plugging it. It still flashed "cln". I decided to clean it again, same problem. So, I returned it.  Got a brand new one. I thought maybe I had recieved a defective one.  But after only two weeks this one did the same thing! I had thrown away the box thinking that this one was good, so I couldn't return it again.  After a few emails with Hamilton Beach, they want me to cut the cord and send them $7.00 to replace it.  I really don't want to replace it with the same thing and I think it's outrageous that they requested S&H.  I've spent a lot of time cleaning, returning the darn thing. Now, I am out the 50.00+ dollars it cost me.  I am very dissapointed with Hamilton Beach, their product and their customer service. Never again.

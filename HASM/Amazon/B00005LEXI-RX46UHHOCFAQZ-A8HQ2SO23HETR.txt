Title: Great little emergency heater
Content:
In our recent bit of windy weather here in the Pacific Northwest, a number of us found ourselves without power for several days.  Without power, even those of us that had gas furnaces or pellet stoves found ourselves getting a bit chilly.
Fortunately, around my house, Mr. Heater came to the rescue.
No, it isn't big enough to keep my whole house toasty warm, but it was just enough to keep one room warm enough to be comfortable in a sweater, (even with a window cracked open for ventilation) and spelled the difference between being able to stay at home and having to try and find a hotel.
One bottle of propane lasted about six hours on the low setting.  The heater is small, light and easy to store and the propane cylinders are available at any hardware store.  (Coleman uses the same one for their propane lanterns.)  They were smart enough to print the operating instructions right on the unit, knowing that most folks will not be able to find an instruction book when this would be most needed.
If you live in an area that even occasionally loses electric power, this is a must-have item.

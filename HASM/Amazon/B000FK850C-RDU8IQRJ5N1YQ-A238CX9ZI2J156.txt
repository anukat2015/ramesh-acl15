Title: So far, so good,  Works great!!
Content:
I received this heater about a week ago and so far it has been working really well.  I have a large room to heat, with 10 ft ceilings (about 230 sq ft) and although it takes about 30 mins, it heats the room up from 63 to 70 degrees.  I love the ocillating feature and I love LOVE the remote.  It really helps to be in bed and not have to leave the warmth of my comforter to turn it on.  Its easy to move around, light weight, and does not get hot on the outside, despite the instruction manual saying that it does.  My only complaint, which is probably something I should have realized when I bought it, is that the heat it produces is a very dry heat, and I have had to get out my humidifyer to balance the dry air output.  Otherwise, my cat and I are very happy.

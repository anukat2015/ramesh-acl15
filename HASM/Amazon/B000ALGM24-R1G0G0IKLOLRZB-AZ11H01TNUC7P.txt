Title: Can't beat this unit for the price!
Content:
Read some good reviews for this programmable thermostat, and I needed to replace my old programmable thermostat which the buttons stopped working.
Setup is quite easy, anyone can do it. Easy to use and the features are great. I haven't see any others with as many features anywhere close to this price range. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced programmable thermostat, that also wants lots of features.

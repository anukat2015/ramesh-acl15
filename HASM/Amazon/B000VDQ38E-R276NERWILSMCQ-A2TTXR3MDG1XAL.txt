Title: disappointed -terrible vac-
Content:
i'm disappointed that we wasted a wedding gift card on this piece of "poop" vacuum cleaner. i strongly suggest DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM! we have a dog and cat -both of which don't shed a lot. the vacuum spits dirt, dust, everyting it sucks up back onto the floor -especially when we use the hose for baseboards and crevices. it somehow sucks in the smell of animal and blows it back into the air. the belt burns easy b/c the spinning brush element on the base of vacuum VERY often gets stuck and doesn't spin causing the belt to burn. the floor level dial doesn't seem to be of any use b/c the vacuum is a chore to push around. save yourself (and money) A LOT of frustration, headaches, and sneeze-fits. we contacted bissell and they were responsive but basically stated that it was USER error and we needed to clean it or take it for service...we haven't had it long enough (6 mths) for it to need service. DO NOT BUY!!

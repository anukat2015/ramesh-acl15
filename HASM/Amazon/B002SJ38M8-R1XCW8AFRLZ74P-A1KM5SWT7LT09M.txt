Title: A really great alternative to a netbook
Content:
I bought this for my wife and she LOVES it.  I played with it a little while when I was setting it up for her (moved it to LINUX), and I'm actually thinking about getting another one for myself.  :-)
I'm very glad I didn't go the true 'netbook' route and got this instead.  This has much better performance than any netbook I've ever tried.  Everything works very well and it really feels like good quality.

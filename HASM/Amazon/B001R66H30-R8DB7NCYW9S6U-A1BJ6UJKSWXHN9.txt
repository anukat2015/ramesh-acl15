Title: Not what I expected
Content:
I was sooo looking forward to this grinder/brewing coffee maker--especially due to the burr grinder---the one cuisinart I had before was never a consistant grind.  We've used it for 7 days in a row now, and it was time to clean it---impossible and a huge mess.  Hard to clean, and what felt like engineering a coffee grinder early in the morning when you haven't even had your coffee yet!  I'm sending it back.
Plus, we like our coffee pretty strong.  I set the program for strong and poured enough water for 8 cups. The coffee ended up much weaker than I expected.  I tried a work around by programming 12 cups but only adding water enough for 8 cups.  This made a big difference it was just the way we like it.   Thermal carafe it awesome.  And it tastes just as hot and fresh the first pour as it does 3 hours later.   I'm purchasing the same coffee maker but without the grinder, then buying a nice grinder as well.  Can't seem to find a grinder/brewing combo that hasn't left me disappointed.

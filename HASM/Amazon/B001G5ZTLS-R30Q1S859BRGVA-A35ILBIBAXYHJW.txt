Title: Worthwhile upgrade from 5D
Content:
Pros:
Fantastic image quality, with excellent S/N ratio, with very usable iso 6400.
Excellent resolution, esp when used with high grade optics
Excellent menu system
Very useful implementation of Auto ISO
Video Function is amazing.  
Cons:
Additional Battery is very expensive.
Canon should have included some video editing software. I have found the best over all simple solution to be power director on PC.
I wish all 9 focus points where cross type with extra sensitivity bellow 2.8

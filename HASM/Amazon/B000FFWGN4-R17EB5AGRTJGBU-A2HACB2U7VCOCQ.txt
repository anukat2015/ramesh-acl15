Title: Not worth the hassle
Content:
I bought this vacuum a year ago and it has been to the shop about 4 times now.  We have almost paid as much in repair as we paid in price! We have also had to fix it ourselves on many occasions.  It is not able to handle our animals fur and the canister is very small.  It clogs constantly and even the guy we brought it to for repair said it was not worth buying.  I am now looking for a Dyson to see if that works.  All this been said, I do have 4 animals and I vacuum every day, but I still think that this is not a good product.  I have always used Hoover in the past and I found them much better, I just thought I'd try this one out, but sadly to no avail.

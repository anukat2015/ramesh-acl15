Title: Great Camera!
Content:
This is a great great camera! I was undecided between the D80 and the more expensive D200. This is the best bang for your money hands down! Amazon offered the best price, and it was delivered quickly. I also ordered the 18-200mm VR lens. This baby is fantastic! This is a great lens that covers an amazing range. The lens delivery was a bit delayed and did not arrive when the body did. All in all, I would highly recommend these.

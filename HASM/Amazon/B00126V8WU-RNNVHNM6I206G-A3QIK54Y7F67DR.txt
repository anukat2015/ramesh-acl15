Title: Anybody want to by an iPod Nano?
Content:
iPod?   pffft...
4gb Sansa Clip works and sounds so much better.  Way more functions ie, TV's at my gym broadcast in FM - this has FM built in! Best of all, when working out, the controls are so much easier than the iPod wheel.  Ever try adjusting volume on your iPod when working out?  Not always easy, huh?  This thing is way better.  Seriously, check it out.

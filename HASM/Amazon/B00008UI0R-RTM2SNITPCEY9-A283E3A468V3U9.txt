Title: hard working vacuum
Content:
After researching many vacuums, I can say I am more than pleased with this one.  The setting for floors vs carpet is on the handle making it easy to switch cleaning modes.  It has suction control and a number of useful attachments.  However, because of the cannister's compact size, they don't all fit on/in the vacuum.  It's not a deal breaker though.  The cannister is easy to empty and clean.  The retractable cord is great for quick storage.  Overall design is great for small spaces, stairs, and it is surprisingly powerful.  I actually have to lower the suction level to avoid picking up my area rugs while cleaning!   It is also quiet for such a powerful vacuum.  No scaring the children or the pets!  If you have lots of hardwood floors and a couple of area rugs in your home, this vacuum will be perfect.   Oh - and you can't beat the value for this price.  Buy it!

Title: ehh, it's okay
Content:
The stuff I read about this unit was way worse than it is. Overall, I've been pleased with the unit.
When it first arrived it had a very small area near a leg/foot/wheel that was rusty. I'm on a remote island where shipping is an issue and so is humidity (EVERYTHING rusts so I needed a clean slate with complete enamel) so I sent it back. I received a replacement immediately...like two days or a day later, I was shocked and quite pleased. 
I ordered this from Amazon, not another vendor...and I think that's why the replacement came so quickly.
Folks have claimed it leaks. I haven't had that issue.
Folks claim it is loud. It has been quiet, only has like one or two quiet clicks (sounds of the oil moving around and getting hot, sounds like a drop of water or a click). 
It sends of a subtle heat but in a short bit, it heats the room/area adequately. I'd prefer it to be pumping out higher temp heat but so far, really, it has heated the room adequately...not too little and not too much and in just the right amount of time. 
It says it is best to use near a drafty area and I've found that to be true. I guess it fakes the unit into staying on because it has cool air affecting the thermostat.

Title: Fast and Reliable
Content:
I purchased this because of it's size and weight.  I got another notebook, a Lenovo T61 with faster processor so i decided to have a small computer comfortable enough to read e-books and browse thru the internet.  I wanted something much faster than a regular netbook with Atom processors.  This notebook (I won't consider this a netbook because of it's power) save my project.  My Lenovo crushed on me with 4 days before project deadline.  Out of desperation, I loaded Autocad on this computer, attached it to a 20 inch screen, no problem.  I hardly noticed the difference in speed.  The Acer handled the software easily.  it's totally Compatible with windows 7.  Project submitted on time.  This notebook also runs Adobe photoshop without any problem too.  I got this computer for $599 last month. Now the price is even higher.  I'm not surprised.  This computer is really a good buy.

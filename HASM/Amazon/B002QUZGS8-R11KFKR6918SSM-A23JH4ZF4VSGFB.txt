Title: NOT FOR INDOOR USE!!
Content:
I ordered this item after researching online for efficiency and price.  I intended to use it as emergency heat for my small home.  However, when I received the heater and took out the user's manual, I was immediately warned, in at least 3 areas on the cover page alone, the this heater was NEVER to be used indoors in a house, camper, or EVEN A TENT!  I never saw any warning in the product description online, and several reviewers even mentioned that they use the heater in their home.  BEWARE!  It is no doubt a fine product, used properly.  But:  IT IS NOT FOR INDOOR USE!

Title: Major upgrade from a point-and-shoot
Content:
This is a great crossover product from a high end point-and-shoot to a low-end DSLR.  It's exceptionally light and small for a DSLR.  You can set it to "AUTO" and, without learning a thing about photography, be taking great pictures.  
The single-screen readout of F-stop, shutter, aperture, ISO, and everything else is a handy way to get all the current settings at once.  On the flip side, the UI is sometimes inconsistent. For example, pushing the "zoom" button repeatedly zooms in on an image you've taken.  Pushing the "flash" button repeatedly does nothing - you have to push and hold the button, then turn the dial to change flash modes (for example to turn off the flash).  That is unless you're in one of the manual modes, in which case pushing the button causes the flash to pop up.  Hm.
There two non-obvious shortcomings as compared to a point-and-shoot that you may want to consider.  First, most DSLRs (including this one) don't let you preview the shot on the LCD.  You have to compose the picture through the viewfinder, then view the results on the (large and bright) LCD after you've taken the picture.  Second, you have to manually put on & remove the lens cap.  A minor thing that can become quite a pain, especially since Nikon didn't invest the $0.50 to include a little retaining strap - you're always mistplacing the cover. 
On the whole, I'm delighted with this purchase after shooting with it for a few days.  I can't wait to take it on the next family vacation.

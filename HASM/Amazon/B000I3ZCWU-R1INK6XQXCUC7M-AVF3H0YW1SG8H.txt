Title: One of the best affordable SLRs
Content:
This is my first SLR. With my little experience on photography, I can tell that this is a great camera even for the simple users for home photography. You can use the flash and regulate the photo brightness (add some shadow if the pic is over exposed, I use the free software Picasa2). You will need a very steady hand and a steady subject to click without flash under little low brightness or dimmed environment. 
I use lenses with Image Stabilizer and I have also found the Cannon's relatively cheaper fixed 50 mm lens going very good with the camera especially for low light photos. 
I would like to add that I do not know much of photography to comment well on this product.

Title: Not wowed
Content:
This vacuum does OK on my stairs but not for areas any bigger. My kids got crackers on the carpet and so I thought I would just take care of it quickly with my new hand vac, but I found it was a long tedious process to clean up such a small area. Next time it will be faster just to drag out the big vac. I'm a little disappointed. I dislike writing a bad review.

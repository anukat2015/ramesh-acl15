Title: A great little iPod for those on the run
Content:
I bought this iPod as a gift, as a matter of fact, I have purchased over a dozen of them for gifts, both business and personal.  Everyone loves an iPod (or so it seems to me).  I bought this one in pink (again, it was for a gift) and even though I am sure that Apple is coming out with a newer one with more memory and probably a lower price I choose this one because:
* It is great for those who run or walk a lot.  It fits on an arm-band better that some of the longer and larger models
* The screen is big enough for most purposes.  It is good for song info, pictures and ever a short video.  For movies I prefer my iTouch with it's larger screen
* Price.  Even if they come down this one is still a good value
iPods are fun, and this one is even more fun that my iTouch because it is smaller and cute.  How many electronic gadgets can you say that about?

Title: Do yourself a favor and look for a different model
Content:
I used this coffee maker twice and both times I got a warm cup of coffee.  Unfortunately there is nothing you can do besides "pre-warm the carafe" per the instructions to make the coffee hotter from the machine.    What's the point of a programmable coffee maker if I have to wake up early to manually warm up the carafe?   I'll box it up tonight to return it.
Do yourself a favor and look for a different model.

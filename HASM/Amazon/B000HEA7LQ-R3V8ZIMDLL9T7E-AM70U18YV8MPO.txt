Title: Works well - a solid product
Content:
I installed this myself in a new 900 sq ft detached garage workshop.  Installation was straightforward and it works as advertised.  More quiet and vibration free than I expected and has operated for a month so far without any problems.
45000 btu model is well matched to this size building (note that the building is well insulated R19 walls and R30 ceiling and tightly constructed).  No problems maintaining 60F above outdoor temp even with strong winds.
You'll need two fairly strong installers or some clever lifting devices to mount it to the ceiling since the unit is about 65 lbs.  It's built just like an 80% eff home furnace only smaller.

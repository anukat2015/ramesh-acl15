Title: Very disappointed
Content:
I've only had this player for 2 months, and I'm already trying to send it back to Creative Labs to get fixed because IT HAS STOPPED WORKING.  It doesn't turn on, and my computer doesn't even recognize it when it's plugged in.  I've tried the troubleshooting tips provided in the forums on Creative's website (i.e., reinserting the battery, holding down the Menu button).  I don't even use this player often; probably only twice a week at most.  From the few times I have used it, it worked like a dream come true: fast and easy transfers, great sound quality.  It comes with software to download, but you don't even need it.  Once you plug it into your computer, it's recognized as a removeable drive, so all you have to do is open up Windows Explorer and click/drag your files (music, docs, apps, pics, etc.).  The earbuds didn't fit well in my ears, though, so like other people have recommended, you might want to invest in another pair.  Also, I wish there were a manual lock on the outside so the buttons don't get accidentally pushed while the player is in your pocket.  There's a digital lock, but I feel like a manual lock would be more convenient.
Thank god I'm still under warranty (90 days only!).  If yours breaks after 90 days, Creative will make you pay for the repairs.  Good luck!

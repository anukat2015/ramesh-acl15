Title: Portable Air Conditioners just don't work well
Content:
I have tried 5 different units over 8 yeasrs (two being this one). Only one worked 1/2 way decent, and it still has problems. 
This one is the most powerful 110volt portable unit there is.
In general, they all end up leaking water all over the place. None of them seem to be able to evaporate the water as fast they are supposed to. By winter, I can expect the units to leak water everywhere, and the water light never comes on.
All 5 brands are cheaply made and by the same factory even though they are from different manufacturers.
If you are looking for portable AC. Better to skip it as you'll be lucky if you find a unit that satifies your needs. IF you are insistant, go with a better built unit. Google around for a unit built in the US, most likely it will be designed for server room cooling. Most likely that will run $1000-$3000. 
I am on my 5th unit and wish we had just spent the money up front instead of having to replace the unit every year as we are doing now.
These units are generally cheap and you get what you pay for. I would rate this higher if not for the water issue (I just cleared an 1/8 inch of standing water out of a 12 x 12 room).

Title: WHAT IS UP WITH THE TOUCHPAD!!!!!
Content:
Don't buy this notebook computer.  When typing the cursor jumps, WITHOUT WARNING, to some other spot in the document.  I type roughly 90 words a minute.  When I do decide to look up at what I am typing, I see that it is ruined.  The touchpad on my Vaio does not work AT ALL!  I wish I had read these other reviews before I purchased it or shortly thereafter.  I would have quickly returned it for a refund.  I was forced to purchase a wireless mouse to use since the touchpad doesn't function.  This thing is garbage!

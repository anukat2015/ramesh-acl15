Title: Efficient and Affordable
Content:
I had an old heater that only provided heat to a small area and burned you when it was on.  This heater works great in comparison.  It provides a nice amount of heat that doesn't seem to provide a burning sensation.  The adjustable thermostat and the second lower-heat setting are also nice additions.  I would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a efficient low-priced personal heater.  Receiving free shipping was also a bonus.

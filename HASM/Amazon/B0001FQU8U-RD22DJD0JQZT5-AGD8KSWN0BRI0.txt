Title: Noisy, and does not cool
Content:
I bought one of these a few months ago and just today hooked it up. It seems to be doing its job (on a fairly cool day), but it is sooooo noisy. White noise I can live with, but the condenser rattles and shakes in a way that is rather startling ("What's that???") throughout the house. Too late to return it, but I think it will be used only on the hottest of days. (I'll edit to tell you how it does on a hothot day when we get one of them.)
Edit: it does not cool even one small room. At all. Total waste of money. I can't seem to edit my rating down to one star, but it should be starless.

Title: I love this Macbook
Content:
Why not 5 stars? well first is the price. I would love to seen the price at $1499 because of the 2gigs of ram, I think if it would of come with 4gigs of ram at $1599 that would of been perfect. Next is no firewire! I can see why no 800 port but 400 come on, if apple is killing firewire just do it!
Now the things I like. The screen is LED! when you open the macbook its up and no waiting for the bulb  to go to full power. The  trackpad will take sometime to get used to, but its big, fells very nice, and smooth! keyboard is big, backlight is bright, I do miss the num keys. The superdrive is quiet and fells the about the same speed. 
I have 2 things that I love. The macbook does not get HOT! I'm writing this and the temp is 115F , and the fan rpm is 1999 so quiet. Next is the weight it is 4.5lbs I don't know why you would buy a macbook air now. for 1.5lbs you get superdrive, changeable battery, up to 4gigs of ram, bigger hard drive, and it fells almost as small as the macbook air.

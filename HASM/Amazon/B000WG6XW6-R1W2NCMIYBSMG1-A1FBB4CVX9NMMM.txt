Title: Great Buy
Content:
I'm really happy with this product, I've had it a couple of days and already I love it.  The touch pad is very responsive and sensitive.  The screen is bright and clear.  I've had no problems with the software or getting any of my music onto it.  I love the fact that the touchpad can also be used as a normal button.  It has a very sleek design, nice packaging and the headphones are amazing.  Immediately after putting in the headphones, even without music on, outside noise diminishes. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a lot of music or videos and wants a nice looking mp3 player with awesome work-ability.

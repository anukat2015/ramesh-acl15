Title: Nice at first, but it doesn't last.
Content:
I got this coffeemaker a little over a year ago.  Up until the other day, I would probably have given it 4 stars because it was fine.  Then one day the self-clean light started flashing, and then it went out.  The water doesn't go thru the machine anymore, it just gets stuck somewhere and produces lots of steam.  The owners manual says I should clean it by filling w/ water and vinegar, then press the self clean button.  I do this, but nothing happens. The vinegar won't do any good because it won't go through the machine.  It just sits there and makes vinegar-smelling steam.    I search online for ideas and find out that this coffeemaker is considered The Best, and highly recommended (!!!) ...but I also see a lot of negative reviews for other Cuisinart coffeemakers (DCC 2000).  I could send this machine back as it's under warranty but I am really tired of messing around with this. I just want coffee in the morning. I really don't care about programmable features, I just want a coffeemaker that will make good tasting coffee day in and day out--and will last more than a year.  Looks like I will be heading over to the hardware store to buy a Mr. Coffee.

Title: Zune... Nice Hardware, Bad Software
Content:
The Zune has a nice selection of music, and I like the way you can put pictures on it. I don't use the WiFi at all. I think that Microsoft had better make more things available for the Zune besides just music. It needs something like iTunes. If you are buying something the same price as a 30GB Ipod Video, you should get the same quality. Itunes has movies available. Microsoft needs this too to survive. 
Is there a way to convert iTunes video files to the Zune?

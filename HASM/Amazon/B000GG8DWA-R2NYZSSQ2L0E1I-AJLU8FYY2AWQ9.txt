Title: Does the job...
Content:
I had a Soleus MS12 personal heater which did a very good job of providing warmth to a small area.  The only drawback was that it was so bright that trying to watch TV with it in front of me was distracting.  It blew its heating lamps after three or four years of intermittent use.
Except for the brightness, I wouldn't have hesitated buying another one.  It was cheap enough that its relatively short life was not an issue.
So, I bought this unit.  Its brightness is no longer an issue, I can watch TV with it sitting in front of me and not even be aware of it.  The heat output is a mite lower than the Soleus, and I find myself using the higher setting now and then, whereas I rarely did so with the Soleus.
It serves the purpose and the cost is right.

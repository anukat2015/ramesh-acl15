Title: Big Mistake!
Content:
I bought this item as i needed something to cool off my living room in my small apartment. It claims to cool the surrouding room temp by 12 degrees. That is bull. Even with 50 plus ice cubes, both ice packs and a full tank of water this unit is worthless. My regular fan does a better job than this thing.

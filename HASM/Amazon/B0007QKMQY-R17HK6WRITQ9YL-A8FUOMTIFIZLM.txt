Title: Well worth he price
Content:
This camera offers a lot for the price. At 8MP it is all the serious amateur will need for good prints up to 11x14. It is very user-friendly and I judge user-friendly by how often I have to refer to the manual. All controls are easily accessible so it is easy to switch from 100 to 400 ISO or from flash to no flash or from aperature priority to speed priority. Also, there is vely little delay between shots. My only quarrel with this camera is that the resolution choices do not go low enough. If you know you want to use photos on the Internet, you don't need more than 200 KB; larger resolution settings use up memory space both on the memory card and on the computer and are slow to send with e-mail. But this is a minor complaint. I love the camera

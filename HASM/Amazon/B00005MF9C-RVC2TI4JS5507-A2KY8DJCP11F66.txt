Title: Very Pleased
Content:
I bought this coffee-maker instead of one of the more expensive Keurig ones. I wanted something to make just a cup of coffee as I do not really need a whole pot. This has been a great purchase and a much cheaper price than a Keurig. 
I'm sure the Keurig one makes great coffee too, but this one fit the things I was looking for:
Cheap
Good Quality
Single-serve 
I can see the problems some of the people have about spillage and such, but it is not too big of a deal for me. This was a great buy for me and would highly recommend it.

Title: Nikon D300
Content:
Product was shipped and received on time - good service. The D300 is a very sophisticated high end camera. I am an accomplished film photographer but my only previous digital experience has been a Canon PowerShot point-and-shoot. I knew it was time to get serious about digital and wanted a serious camera - the D300 is certainly that. I have a very long way to go before I will be able to take advantage of all this camera can do but suffice it to say that it will do everything you could possibly imagine and do it well. An additional plus for me was the ability to use all of the Nikon AF Nikkor lenses that I already had for my Nikon N90 film camera.
I would not recommend this camera for a casual photographer - it is expensive and you will never take advantage of all it can do; however, if you are a serious photographer or have plans to be one, this is a great camera.

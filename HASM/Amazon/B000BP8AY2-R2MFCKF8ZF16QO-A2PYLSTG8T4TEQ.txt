Title: Everything you need, and then some!
Content:
Seriously, why buy a 2 gig ipod when this is available?  2 gigs?  Check.  MP3 and WMA support?  Check.  FM radio?  Check!  Voice recorder?  You bet your sweet bippy!  
I got this thing for a song, and it came with everything.  USB cable, battery, everything.  It is amazing.  It can store a ton of songs and even has a backlit display.  Definitely one of the best purchases I have made.

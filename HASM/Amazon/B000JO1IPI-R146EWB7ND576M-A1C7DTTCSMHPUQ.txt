Title: DO NOT BUY APPLE
Content:
LOL LOL LOL LOL Amazon you have done a serive to these Mac users. You taught them that they are the ones buying junk ipod products. People read and listen, you have a choice. Do not buy apple products they only work with other apple products and since apple has about 5% of the market.... Oh yes for you, NBC cut it over to their website and opened it up to the rest of the 95% of the market. So they have not lost anything, they have made more money
That is what you get for buying worthless ipods and Apple products. Apple is proprietary and that is why the Amazon Unbox does NOT support it. The .wmv files can be played on a lot of software, such as Toshiba, Creative, iRiver, Archos, Zune, and any player that is playsforsure. As with the ipods and apple files, .m4p's, can ONLY be played on Apple software.
It has not gotten old hearing people just like you complain about spending a lot of money for nothing! LOL LOL LOL

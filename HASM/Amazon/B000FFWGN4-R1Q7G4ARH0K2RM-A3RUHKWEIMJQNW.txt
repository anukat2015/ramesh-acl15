Title: Bissel Lift Off
Content:
After our brand new dirt devil failed on us big time, I did a little research and decided on this Bissell since it is for pets and it was in our price range.  I have 10 cats and 1 dog and this Bissell has been great at picking up all the pet hair.  We only vacuum once a week and, wow, every week this vac picks up a lot of pet hair and dirt; we have had it for at least 5 months and it still hasn't lost any suction power.  Unlike our dirt devil which we returned within a month of the purchase, this vacuum does not overheat or stop suddenly, it just keeps going.  There were only two reasons why this vacuum did not get all five stars, 1) the hose, i think, is very short, and 2)some times the pet hair gets stuck at the upper part and to clean it, while easy, can get a bit messy.

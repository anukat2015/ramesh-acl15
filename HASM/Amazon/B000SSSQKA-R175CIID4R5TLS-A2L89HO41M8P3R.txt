Title: Great design -- except for head
Content:
I bought this item after reading the reviews and noticing that my once-beloved (and much more expensive) Kenmore canisters were being made with progressively cheaper and flimsier parts. My goal was to use this vacuum primarily on hardwood floors and an occasional area rug. I had reservations about the head design (combination unit for carpets and bare floors) prior to ordering, and unfortunately my instincts were correct. On the positive side, this vacuum is very lightweight, has good suction, and has a fantastic feature for connecting the wand to the base for storage. The one negative is a substantial one, however. With the main head in place, the vacuum does an abysmal job on dust and will only collect particles if it goes over them fully centered on the hose unit. So instead of cleaning my floors by vacuuming then mopping, I was finding myself sweeping, vacuuming the debris, dust mopping (or Swiffering) and then mopping. It was so frustrating that I actually bought a Kenmore bare floor tool and modified it to fit the base. This works dramatically better. It's just a pity the vacuum didn't come with an attachment like this in the first place since I couldn't find one that would fit without modification.

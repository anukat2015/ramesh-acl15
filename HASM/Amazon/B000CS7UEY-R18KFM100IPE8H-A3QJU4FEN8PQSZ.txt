Title: A great alternative to iPod, but ...
Content:
It's bigger and heavier, and not as elegant as most iPods. However, the bigger screen and more storage was what made the choice for me, at the time. I can store a few movies on this thing, in addition to podcasts and music and audiobooks.
The touchpad needs to be slowed down (and can be, from the settings).
Another point to keep in mind is that there are umpteen accessories made for iPod, and almost none made especially for the Zen. If that's not an issue, this is a great little player.

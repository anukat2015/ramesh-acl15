Title: Fast & effective, but keep toddlers & pets away
Content:
I have mixed feelings about this heater. I like the innovative design, but it has some shortcomings. Consumer reports listed this as their #2 Rated space header, and after having bought one based on that recommendation, I can see why it was #2 and not #1. 
THE GOOD: 
* DESIGN/OUTPUT: This unit is lightweight, and heats up fast (much faster than an oil radiator). Also, rather than older models using electric wires that glow red hot, this unit has a large 2 dimensional flat panel (behind a grill) that doesn't get hot enough at any one point to glow visibly - which reduces it's fire hazard. There's also much less of the ozone and acrid smell you get with older coil heaters. 
* QUIET: There's no fan, so it's very quiet. 
* MOUNTINGS: This unit can be mounted one of 2 ways - either on the floor atop it's detachable wheel brackets (easy to install, and very stable), or onto a wall with an included wall bracket (which, if your room layout permits, can be a real space-saving boon). I'd have liked to see a better wall bracket, and controls on the front rather than on the side (hard to read if mounted to a wall), but oh well. 
* ANTI-FROST SETTING: According to the manual, if you set the thermostat to "*", and the output to 2 (High), it can be used to help prevent frost in an unheated room, by automatically cycling on below 41F. 
THE MEDIOCRE: 
* SAFETY: The box cover shows a picture of a pair of hands and the word "SAFE" in large print. I find that to be a bit misleading, because when this unit is set to HIGH (Position 2) in a very cold room, the front grill will slowly get very hot ... not hot enough to pose a serious fire hazzard mind you, but definitely hot enough to cause yelps, minor skin burns, and melt certain types of plastic and nylon on casual contact.  Granted that this only happens in very cold rooms in which the unit has to work for extended periods at full power, but IMO, this still makes unsuitable for floor use in rooms frequented by toddlers and/or pets - it those circumstances, it should be wall mounted (out of reach) instead. 
* THERMOSTAT CONTROLS: The knob is analog, albeit marked with 7 positions - * (anti-frost), and 1 (cool) through 6 (max warm). Accordingly, it requires trial and error to get the thermostat's kick-in point where you need it to be. IMO, the unit would be significantly improved by adding a digital thermostat. 
* OUTPUT CONTROLS: This unit only has 3 settings: 0 (off), 1 (750 watt), and 2 (1,500 watt), and it has a big red LED. First, two settings is not enough ... at the very least, there should be 3 (Lo, Med, High). Second, the LED stays lit all the time, and merely serves to indicate whether or not it's plugged into a live outlet, not whether or not it's cycling on. A simple design change would fix that: they could mount a 2-color LED that would be off when the unit was off, green when the unit was on standby, and red when the thermostat kicks in the heater. 
* POWER CORD: The maximum output of this heater (1,500 watts on setting 2) seems a bit close to the maximum rating of it's power cord (which looks like 1,800 watt lamp cord). The manually even says that it's normal for the cord and plug to get warm ... uh, yeah. The unit needs a cord with a higher maximum wattage rating, and it'd be nice if it were slightly longer (and had a space to coil it) as well. 
Bottom line: It's a good, and innovative, space heater - but anyone with young children and/or pets should be careful how/where they use it.

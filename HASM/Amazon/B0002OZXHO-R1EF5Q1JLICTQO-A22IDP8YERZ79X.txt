Title: This thing has changed my life - for free too
Content:
Hi everyone!  I'm living proof that you really can get an ipod for free.  Not here to market my links though, on to my review! 
This thing has changed my life.  I added the iTrip to it so now I can play through any stereo equipped with a radio (including my shower radio!).  The battery life has been great. I only need to charge it every other day and I listen to it all day at work and sometimes when I'm sleeping. 
If I could make one suggestion - when you're listning to a song and press menu - artist - I'd prefer it to land on the artist you are currently listening to.  That's my only gripe - when you fill up your ipod (and mine's close) it can be a pain to scroll through all of the artists when you hear something on random that you like!  
Any questions - IM me: WinterGetsMe   Thanks and vote for my review!

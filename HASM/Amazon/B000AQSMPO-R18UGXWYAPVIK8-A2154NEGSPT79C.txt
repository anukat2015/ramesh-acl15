Title: It's a winner!
Content:
The Keurig B60 is perfect for my husband and me.  We don't drink coffee every day, and when we do, one cup each is enough for us. We are very happy with our Keurig.  Others have mentioned noise from the machine. We don't find it noisy at all. We are enjoying trying the many varieties of coffees and teas available.  That's another plus - we can each have whatever coffee flavor we want!

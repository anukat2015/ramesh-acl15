Title: Love the speed control and light weight
Content:
I bought this for reliability. I am sick of buying vacuums and disposing of them in 2-3 years. Sidenote...do not trust Consumer Reports for reviews. I kept buying their top recommendations and they fall apart.
This vacuum is lightweight, yet powerful. It has an adjustable setting that controls speed. When vacuuming the hard wood floor, we crank down the power and this vacuum goes ulta guiet! This is the best feature to me.
It does not clean our area carpets well, thus I give it 3 stars. If it last 7 years, it would deserve 4 or 5 stars. Maybe I will come back and update the review in 7 years. ;-)
If the vacuum came with a powered deep cleaner, I think it would deserve an extra star.

Title: Unfortunately, this product does not SUCK.
Content:
When my upright vacuum died after I had replaced 95% of my carpet with hardwood, I thought a cannister vacuum would be a better choice.  I have two other Bissell products (the Pro Heat 2X carpet cleaner, and the SpotBot) and have been happy with the performance of both.  Unfortunately, the DigiPro did not live up to my expectations.  There are some nice features, like the telescoping feature of the wand, and the unit is less noisy that the old upright.  And I sort of got used to the heavy wand and the clunkyness of it.  But now I find that the genuine Bissell vacuum bags have such a flimsy built-in gasket, that air leaks in at that point and there is no suction at the end.  Bissell customer support was not helpful and are not aware of any problems.  I will try to find the non-Bissell vacuum bags that I bought once before that had a stronger gasket, and save my pennies for a new vacuum that actually does suck.

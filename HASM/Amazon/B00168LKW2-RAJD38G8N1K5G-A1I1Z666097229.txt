Title: Baby it's ICE COLD inside!
Content:
DeLonghi PAC A120E was easy to set-up, because it included EVERYTHING!
I am just loving it. Comming home from work to a nice COOL place. Who could ask for anything more. I have not seen my Electric Bill yet, so I will only give it four stars.
*****update - I just got my Con Edison bill in the amount of $299.89! I was in a little bit of a shock (my normal bill is $115ish).  I guess i will have to cut down on usage.  I have all the lastest energy saving devises(cfl light blubs) etc., and I have to find more ways to save on my Con Ed bill.  Keeping cool this summer for me is a must!
Note: Con Edison did get a rate increase recently, so some of the cost is because of that.

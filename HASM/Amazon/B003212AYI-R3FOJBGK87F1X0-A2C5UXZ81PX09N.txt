Title: why is the hard drive on this new laptop obsolete?
Content:
This scant specification is a deviation from Sony's specification. The hard drive on this laptop is an obsolete Seagate ST412 with speed of 3200 rpm.  Sony's harddrive is a Serial ATA with speed of 7200 rpm.  BECAREFUL before purchase.

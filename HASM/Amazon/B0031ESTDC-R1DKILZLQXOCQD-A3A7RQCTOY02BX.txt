Title: Great machine
Content:
Fast, easy to set up.  Not too much crapware.  Keyboard is good size and screen is very clear.  Battery is amazing. 7 hours + is definitely possible if you're careful.  Most average use is more like 4.5 which is still impressive. Super light to travel with. Charger brick is fairly small.
Only downside I can tell is the glossy finish which picks up fingerprints way too easily.
All in all a great buy.

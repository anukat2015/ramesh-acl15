Title: So easy to adjust
Content:
This vacuum means never having to bend over to adjust the settings.  Suction control is ON the handle, as is the carpet/bare floor control.  With the suction on full power, you'd suck a throw rug up, but with just with a slide of your thumb, you can decrease the suction.  Leave the beater bar rolling (or not), clean your throw rugs.  Use the bare floor nozzle (or not) to vacuum tile and hardwood floors.  Dust cup is large and covered, so pop it out, bring it to whichever trash can you like and empty it.  Has an adjustable wand that's perfect for tall (or short) users.  Filters are all washable to save bucks. We have hairy dogs and this works great...futhermore, no doggy smell while vacuuming.  The hepa filter apparently works, too!  Pretty lightweight, easy to manuever and no brainer operation.

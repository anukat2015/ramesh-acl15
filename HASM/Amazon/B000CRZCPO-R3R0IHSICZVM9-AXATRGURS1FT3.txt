Title: Blown away!!!
Content:
What a camera! I have leaped from the basic point and shoot into the D200 world and have to say : wow! heavy, solid feel and great choice of lenses just as fantastic as the D200. Pair it with a 18-200VR lens and will for sure be astonished by the photo quality! I could not be happier after 6 months of use in a variety of conditions.

Title: This does wonders after a Pug, Husky and 4 kids!
Content:
I LOVE this vacuum!  I have a pug and a husky and between the two of them I always needed to stop in the middle of vacuuming with my old vacuum cleaner to unclog it!  The only reason I need to stop now is to empty the 'bag' because it picks up SO much!  I haven't used all the attachments yet but I'm sure they work just as well!  
My only problem with the machine is that when you have the pet-hair lifter down it doesn't do edging very well.  It is also a bit heavy so my old vacuum will be the downstairs vacuum and this one will be my upstairs and stairs vacuum.
Assembly was a tad bit of a pain but I was able to put it all together myself, once I found a screw driver!  The directions weren't very clear but if you can use common sense, you can figure it out on your own!

Title: Wiring labeling confusing.
Content:
I concurr with the previous post. Not only is the wiring label incorrect, but the scheme is also confusing to the self-installer. I ended up returning this thermostat and purchasing a Honeywell model #183788, which had extremely straightforward wiring with easy to understand instructions.
My advice: Spend the extra money and buy a Honeywell.

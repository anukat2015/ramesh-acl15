Title: Happy...Just a few annoyances
Content:
So far after more than two weeks with it, i can say i am a happily satisfied customer. Though i am annoyed by some quirks. The battery is a just a bit loose but nothing to worry, the sound sucks, and the keyboard is greasy. But none of these are dealbreakers. overall it fits my needs as a college student: lightweight, solid build and design, and Windows 7 is awesome. Way better than vista. And the price is just about right (though i got it cheaper than current price).

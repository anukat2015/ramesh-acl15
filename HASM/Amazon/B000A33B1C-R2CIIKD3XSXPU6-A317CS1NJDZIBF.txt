Title: Noisy noisy
Content:
I was very unsatisified with this heater.  It did a fine job of putting out heat, but I was shocked at how much noise it made.  whenever the heating element would turn on it made loud popping and splattering noises.  It sounded like boiling oil.  We had bought this unit to put in our babies room, but it makes way too much noise to be in a bedroom...and we're not talking "white noise", it's a very loud and annoying popping sound.
Thank goodness amazon has such a hassle-free return policy.  I sent it back.

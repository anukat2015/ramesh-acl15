Title: Great Coffee Maker, but...
Content:
I ordered this coffee maker based on reviews from Amazon and other sources.  The machine looks great in my kitchen and makes probably the best tasting coffee that I have ever had (I drink a lot of coffee).  The only downside I can report on is that the coffee maker's LCD clock needs a backlight.  The display is small and hard to read in all but the brightest light.  Plus, the caraffe automatically goes off after two hours which can be annoying.  There is a beep tone to warn you, but resetting the blasted thing is an irritation.  Other than that, I would buy another as I am pleased with my purchase.

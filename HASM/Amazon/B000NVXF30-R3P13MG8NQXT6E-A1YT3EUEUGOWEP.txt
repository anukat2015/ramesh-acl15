Title: Great Camera, Volatile Price
Content:
I ordered this camera through Amazon (actual vendor was Adorama Camera)on July 10th, and by the time I received it on July 14th, the price had dropped by $50.  (I still paid the higher price!) I've notice the pricing is very volatile for some reason.  Regardless, I really like the camera.

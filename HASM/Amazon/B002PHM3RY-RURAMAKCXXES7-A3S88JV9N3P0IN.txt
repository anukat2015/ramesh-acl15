Title: Nice design...  but DOA.
Content:
Nice little laptop - 11.6" screen is nice size - good hardware specs, and pretty quick for such a small machine - when it worked.  Got BSOD first time I turned it on, which gave me a bad feeling from the get-go...  After that, got BSOD every time it would turn on or wake from sleep, and finally wouldn't boot at all.  Returned after 3 days.  Maybe it's just bad memory modue, but ACER doesn't seem ready for prime-time.

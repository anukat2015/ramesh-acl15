Title: Good for small spaces
Content:
Hi Everyone, Ive been reading reviews and I was getting more confused,  not less confused! So I finally decided to just purchase one and see for myself! I first saw an advertisement for the Eco-Heater in Cat Fancy magazine touting it for pet rooms. We have two outside cats who come into the garage to sleep at night. We are in MS, so it's not the frozen tundra of the north, but we do get under freezing. Right now it's 10:30am and 35 degrees. My husband put in a insulated room of 7x7x6 for the cats. Most people have closets bigger then this! But it's in a totally unheated garage and the Eco-Heater warms it up great! It is perfect for pets who could other wise knock over a freestanding heater. It does get hot to the touch, but my cat rubbed up against it the other day and it didn't faze her.
But here is the caveat. I have a 14x14x8 bedroom with 6 windows and no central heat. I don't think even two of these would make it toasty enough. They might warm it up a bit, or if you could get them close to the bed. I'm speculating, but I really think these would work better in small enclosed spaces without drafts, such as a bonus room off of a bedroom or a small office, or if you have central heat and you just need this for supplemental heat. So I am not going to purchase these for my bedroom, because they are hard to get vendors to take them back and if I'm not happy with how they warm up the room I'm stuck with them. 3 of them might work, but then you are into $400.00. Plus I'm concerned with the reviews about the cracking and not lasting for more then a couple of years. Too much money if they don't last very long!
I hope this was helpful.

Title: Great Light vacuum
Content:
I read many many reviews for weeks before purchasing this vacuum. I have mostly hardwood floors, a few rugs, steps that need vacuuming and 5 cats. My previous Hoover upright vacuum died, and i am very glad i purchased a canister type. It has great suction, is light to carry and picks up all the cat hair. I can't believe I waited so long to purchase this. I highly recommend this product.

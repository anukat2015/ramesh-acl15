Title: Terrible product with ridiculous warranty
Content:
I purchased my first Vornado heater, a reconditioned model, and had to return it because it simply did not put out any heat on the low setting, smelled like it was burning on high setting, and the tip over feature did not work. Obviously it wasn't reconditioned very well, or is this just a bad product?Well, I got my answer when I decided to purchase a new Vornado thinking the first time was a fluke (I have owned a Vornado Fan which I like). Well, once again on low setting there was no perceptible heat and on high once again that burning smell. I left the heater on low but at the highest thermostat setting and checked on the room temp after 2 hours. The temp had gone up 2 degrees! On a whim I checked the manual and while reading it I came upon the warranty info. If something goes wrong with the unit within a year we have to ship the product back at our cost(most companies do this), but the company said to include a check for $ for postage! I called Vornado, however, and they said they do not require this-so why put that in writing? Very odd.Vornado products are overpriced to begin with and their quality control is non-existent. Have you ever wondered why there are so many reconditioned Vornado heaters for sale here? Now we all know why. Their heaters stink...

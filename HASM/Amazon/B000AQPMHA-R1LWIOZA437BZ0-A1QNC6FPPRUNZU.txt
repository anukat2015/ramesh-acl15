Content:
This is the fourth Keurig brewer I have owned in ten years and the only one that has been defective from the beginning. Two of the three--higher-end models--have died gracefully after years of service; the third, also a higher-end model, is still in service. This new one made a few cups of coffee at first, then stopped heating the water and turned itself off shortly after the power button was pushed. Now the heating element will not come on at all. No hot water, no coffee.
I am returning the brewer to Amazon for a refund. Having had good service from other Keurig models, I will probably order another, but certainly not another B40. Keurig brewers have been good, solid workhorse products in my household for years. I hope the B40 I am returning is just a lemon, but when quality begins to deteriorate in a line of products, one's trust in that brand begins to diminish.

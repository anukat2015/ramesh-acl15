Title: Nice laptop but the Amazon description is wrong about the Blue-Ray drive.
Content:
This laptop is really nice for the price I paid.  However, I was somewhat disappointed by the wrong technical description listed by Amazon.  The blu-ray drive is definitely NOT read/write capable.  It is a ROM (Read Only)!!  I contacted Sony to verify it.  Thought about returning it but decided it is still a good buy even without that feature.  By the way, I still prefer Windows XP over Vista.  This laptop did not change my opinion about it.

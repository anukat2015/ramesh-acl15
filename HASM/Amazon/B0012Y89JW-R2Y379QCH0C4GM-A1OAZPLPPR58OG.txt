Title: Good camera, okay lens
Content:
Great menu system,  easy to use controls with a wonderful 3" display.  The supplied lens is the downfall for me, the image quality is okay but the "feel" is distressing.  I know the lens is a trade off, offering a lot for the price but putting an "L" lens on the XSi is a real eye opener, brings the camera to life.  Were I to do it over I would easily still buy the Rebel XSi body but would purchase a good prime lens (fast Canon 35 or 50mm) and give up the benefits of the zoom.  Soon after purchasing the Rebel XSi kit I added a Canon 135 f2 L and was rewarded with some stunning photos with great "pop".  While putting a high quality (and high priced) lens changes the XSi from a good camera to a great camera the reviewed lens/body combination is a great move up for most of us and priced well.  Battery life is amazingly good and the RAW image files are supported by many software packages.  The body with a simpler, high quality lens would receive a 5 star rating from this consumer.

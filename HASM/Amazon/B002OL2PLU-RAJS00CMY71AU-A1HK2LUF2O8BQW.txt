Content:
this product like all archos products was released before the software was fuctioning correctly. This is my second achos product,  they are great til you have a problem or they come out with something new to replace your product then you are SOL.  The archos does media better than most other products but is it worth the headache.  I can't stand a company that doesn't stand by their product.  If your not buying this for media your wasting your money.

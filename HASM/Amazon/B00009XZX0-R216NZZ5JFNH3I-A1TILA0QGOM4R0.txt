Title: bigger is always better
Content:
if you're looking for a portable desktop/multimedia center, look no further. although it's probably one of the heaviest notebooks out there at 9.9 lbs, you'll soon forget about the weight once you see the enormous 17&quot; widescreen display. not to mention the blazing fast p4 2.8gHz hyper-threading chip and the 800mHz system bus. the dvd-rw is also a nice feature for home movie making and watching. because of the widescreen, it is able to house a full-size keyboard, which is always a plus when performing tasks that require lots of typing. the entire notebook is housed in a sleek, modern casing with a metallic blue outer shell, and silver metallic on the inside. it has all the ports you need, including an s-video out for connection to your tv, and four - that's right, count'em - four usb 2.0 ports for hooking up peripherals. it even has an SD drive for loading pictures from your digital camera.the harman kardon speakers, while a good idea, are a little on the &quot;tinny&quot; side, so the integration of a subwoofer would have definately rounded out the audio experience. battery life is a little on the short side, but what do you expect from something this powerful? i probably wouldn't recommend extensive traveling with this beast due to it's sheer size and short battery life (in addition to finding a laptop case that will fit it), but as a portable desktop going from room to room in your house, it should fit the bill just fine.

Title: Awesome laptop for an awesome price
Content:
I bought this laptop a few months back for school. I spent weeks looking at laptops and this one outperforms any others in its price range by a long shot. To find a comparable laptop, that also has ASUS's reputation for quality products, you would otherwise pay $1200 easily or more. Battery life is definitely as promised, which means I don't have to carry the wall-adapter with me on campus. Definitely worth the price!

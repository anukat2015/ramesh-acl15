Title: A great upgrade from 300D
Content:
I had 300D and I decided to upgrade to 50D. 
Today, I know I made the right decision when it comes to take pictures.
This camera is better in many ways so, I won't even try to desrcibe. There's some pro sites for that.
As for my experience, I love it. Pictures come out great and I feel like I must take pictures all the time.
If you have any thoughts whether to buy this one or not, DON'T HASITATE. TAKE IT!

Title: First Generation - Doesn't deliver!
Content:
Yes it's a great idea - but they haven't work out the functional flaws yet.  - It is high maintenance.  4 parts need to be taken out and cleaned and dried after each use.- The carafe drips on the counter, no matter how you pour or clean the carafe. (they should be ashamed!)- The water filter makes the coffee taste better - but you can't seem to get a strong pot of coffee out of it.  I think the cone style filter makes a better pot of coffee.- Has a compact case and looks good.- The black one is best, it gets so dirty inside, I can't imagine what the white one looks like.At this price - I'd wait till they have worked out the kinks in the design before purchasing it.  We've had it for 1 month - and wish we had purchased a non grind and brew with a cone filter.

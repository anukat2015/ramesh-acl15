Title: Good little Heater.
Content:
One of my ceramic heaters went bad, so it was time to look for a new one. I decided on this one because of price, type, and also energy used. It was a good price at under 30 bucks. Radiant heat, heats objects that then give off the heat, and not just heat the air. This is both good and bad, as anything too close is going to get VERY HOT. Keep ALL THINGS away from it. Read the instructions. The back of the unit gets hot too, but 8 inches away from the back everything is normal temp. Sides too. Also the top gets hot, and the heat rises. At 800 watts max, it is about half the wattage of regular heaters. Even my old ceramic heater was 1500 on high, so I save a little when using it.
Not too bad. On low, 400 watts, it will heat, or maintain temperature fairly well. The unit is VERY QUIET. Does not have a noisy fan blowing air.
  I have had and used the unit now for one month and I think it is very good. I use it in the garage when working out, and in my bedroom. The heat from the unit goes up as well as out, so it hits the ceiling and moves down, filling the room with a gentle heat. Just keep everything 3feet away from the front and all will be well.
   I tried using it in the living room one morning and it took several hours to raise the temp up about 4 degrees. So this is really a SMALL ROOM heater, where the heat is going to build. Or an area where you are close to it.
   It has over temp shut off and a tip-over switch on the bottom for safety. It has the control on the right side but then there was no room to put the control on the front as there would be no room and would get hot. So, I don't mind.
   A Good Deal All-round.

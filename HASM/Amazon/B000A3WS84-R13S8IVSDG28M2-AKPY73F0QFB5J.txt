Title: The Video Ipod
Content:
I go this ipod and it was great at first. I loved how much music I could store in it, the screen was impressive, i enjoyed watching music videos and tv shows on it and pictures. However, I ran into some problems. first, the battery died out fast in my opinion. Plus, it slipped out of my hand when i used it. it didn't fall very far but this small fall broke it. It looked fine on the outside but on the inside it broke. at least there is a 1 year warrenty which is a plus. I only had the ipod for 3 days and it already broke. they gave me a new one which is a plus for apple. this ipod shouldn't be used for exercising because the spinning hardware inside is VERY sensitive and it could break just from exercising or having it in the car. that is why I am going to return mine, because it probably won't last a day past the warrenty. its sooo sensitive and slippery. even with a case it could break. also, its hard to convert movies and put it on it. You have to have special ways to convert it etc. i want my ipod to last. i want an ipod to keep all my music in that actually won't break sooo easily.

Title: Fantastic with limitations
Content:
Of course this is a fantastic tablet PC.  A bit heavy for the tablet but it also offers full laptop functionality.  Battery life is not great unless you get the 6 cell.  A second battery is a must have for a serious business user.  Beyond these limitations, it is fast and easy to setup and use.  The HP reminders installed re: updated service protection plans etc are a pain and don't go away without manually removing the programs.  But the machine is rock solid.  Very happy overall with my purchase.  Feel free to email me with any questions you have about the product prior to purchase. dct1607@yahoo.com

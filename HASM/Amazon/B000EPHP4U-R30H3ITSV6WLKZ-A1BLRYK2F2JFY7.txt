Title: Impossible to live without
Content:
it took me a long time to get and ipod nano. and now that i do, i don't ever want to part with it.
It's fantastic. it's so incredibly small, i couldn't believe when i first saw. it fits on my hand, on any pocket, sometimes i even forget it's there.
i was scared of breaking it but it's very resistent and it has impressed me.
i love all the space it offers. i made the transition from a 128mb pendrive to a 2gb ipod.
there's no comparison. at first, i didn't had enough music to fill it so i had to ask friends for music reccomendations. i also used amazon's recomendations system.
i love all it's functions. i can read books or fics or even classwork. i can have all the lyrics to the songs. i can put thousands of photos.  especially icons, who show all their color and majesty on the ipod screen. 
i can make a million playlist for all diferent moods and whatever. i can order by album,artist,genre,composer, whatever i want.
if suddenly i want to listen to only a couple of songs, i can make playlists on the go.
i can listen to audiobooks and put them all there. not just a few chapters at a time. 
i can listen to my whole library or just one playlist. put it in random or normal.
shuffle all my playlist. or the artist. or the songs.
i can play when i'm bored.
use it as a hard-drive to transport things.
keep my calendar.
there's three things i always need. my cell phone, my camera and my ipod.

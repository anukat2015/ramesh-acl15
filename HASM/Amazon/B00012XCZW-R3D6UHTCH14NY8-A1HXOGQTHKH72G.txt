Title: Bunn Professional Home Brewer
Content:
We are coffee mavens, drinking many cups a day and will go well out of our way to get a special cup of coffee. The following comments regard multi-cup coffee brewers and not single cup machines with which I am familiar also. We have had Krupp and most of the other main brands and find the Bunn an excellent product. We are on our 2nd Bunn in 8 yrs. What's particularly special about the Bunn is that it keeps a constant hot reservoir of water so that when making a pot of coffee it is instantaneous.....as opposed to the conventional drip coffee makers that take 10-15 min to drip a pot of coffee. We are into instant coffee gratification. You can adjust the strength of the brew (we like it strong) with the amount of fresh coffee in the hopper or the amt of water poured through the machine. The "Professional" Home Brewer is different from the conventional Bunn Coffee Maker, it appears, by the quickness of heating a reservoir of water to almost boiling...it takes less than 10 minutes...(you can make 2, 10-cup pots of coffee in less than 15 min) and the top of the water reservoir swivels to control the "on" valve to allow the water to drip into the pot. This is a technical point and not important to the buyer....

Title: Paid for Themselves!
Content:
I live in the Rockies of Colorado in an all electric house.  My monster central furnance helped create a $300 a month electric bill.  I purchased three of these units - one for the bedroom, one in the living room and one in the kitchen/dining area.  My electric bill immediately went down to $180.  Needless to say, they paid for themselves in just a couple of months.  They are very reliable, give off a nice subtle heat and are very quiet.  I am quite pleased with this purchase.

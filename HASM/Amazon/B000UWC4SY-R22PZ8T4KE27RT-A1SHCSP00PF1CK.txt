Title: Don't buy it
Content:
I liked this coffee maker when I bought it because it is small (I am the only coffee drinker in the house), and it was cute.  However, I hate this coffee pot!  In every other pot I have had, 1 tbsp of coffee grounds to one cup of water has yeilded great coffee.  However, not so with this pot.  If I use that ratio, it is almost always way too weak.  I still have not figured out the right measurement, and am always playing a guessing game with this coffee pot.  Not recommended.  I wish I could return it, but I have used it too many times!  Just splurge and buy something more expensive--you won't be sorry.

Title: Perfect ?
Content:
The Macbook Pro is just awesome.
Once you get to know all the trackpad moves and most of the keyboard shortcuts, it gets really comfortable and instinctive to navigate in Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
I got the 2.26 Ghz for Christmas '09, and I have been really impressed so far. The OS runs really smooth and fast, and the interface is beautiful.
This is my first mac ever, and also was I have been expecting for a computer, but was always disappointed with PCs.
Furthermore, I like how running the terminal on Snow Leopard is similar to running it in a Linux distribution, thanks to the UNIX-based OS.
The only game I tried so far is World of Goo, which runs perfectly on this version of the Macbook Pro.
I might add further details later as I get to know my Macbook Pro better, but so far, I love it.

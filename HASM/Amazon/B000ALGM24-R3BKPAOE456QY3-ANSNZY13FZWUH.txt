Title: Good Buy
Content:
We purchased two of these items for our new house. We live in Arizona, so we need to have these to adjust for the hot afternoons. 
Upon opening it, it looks like a nice product. We were excited to try it! My husband (who is a handyman and knows what he is doing) installed it, and it took FOREVER!!! Not sure what the difference was, but it was probably due to the one that we removed. There was one set of extra wires on the house side. There were no directions that talked about this, so we searched all over the net to try and find information on this. There was no info at all! He finally figured it out and was able to get it to work. 
In all, we were happy with it, but not sure as to what the difficulties with our installation was.

Title: THE Best Coffee I've Ever Brewed
Content:
The machine is good-looking and fast-acting. Plus shhhh quiet for grumpy mornings. And the little ping-ping that alerts you that the coffee is done is great. Best of all: the cofee is hot-hot-hot, and you can keep it as hot as you like with a heat- adjustable warming plate. You do need to measure the water in the carafe--because the quantity guide in the water channel is almost impossible to see. I'll never go back to Braun again. Go ahead and splurge; you'll be glad you did.

Title: Flimsy, breakable, but cute
Content:
I've been using this coffee maker for less than a week. It's cute, shiny, and looks very nice on the counter. It makes good coffee.  It's simple to use.  BUT....This morning, I made coffee as usual, flipped the switch and after a few seconds, the carafe went *pop*, cracked and coffee went all over the counter. I can't find a replacement carafe that fits, because of the awkward shape. I was using plain tap water, not cold water, so there was no rapid temperature change that would explain the cracking. Just crappy construction.
I spent $40 for a week of coffee and now I have to buy another pot. What a waste.

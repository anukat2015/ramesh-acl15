Title: The best media player I have ever had
Content:
This player plays DRM wma very well. Files transfered easily through the standard cable. The voice recording is fantastic. I recorded the conversation in a very noisy conference room, and the voice quality is like I was there. It recognize SDHC. With a simple upgrade, you can transfer the files from SD card to the player. The vedios and photos are sharp. I can read the captions on them. It is the best media player I have ever had. By the way, don't buy the charger from creative.Nexxtech AC/USB Charger is much better

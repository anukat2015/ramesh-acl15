Title: This is THE best vaccum I've ever owned
Content:
I'm skeptical of reviews, having heard that many are planted by the manufacturers, dealers or competitors. However, all the positive comments about this vaccum are right on. I love it! I've spent hundreds of $s on Hoover Wind Tunnels (heavy, bulky)and other vaccums that I have to "feed" dirt to, that R 2 heavy, or that I should have come with earplugs because they're so loud; this 1 is worth every cent. It's quiet and cleans nicely. I agree with others that the cord should be longer, but maybe it's as long as it can be given the small size of the canister? While this vaccum certainly isn't inexpensive, when I think of how much money has been sucked into other vaccums, I wish I had bought this years ago. The old adage of "you get what you pay for" certainly holds true in this case. I have all new hardwood floors and I'm thrilled with it. It's amazingly quiet and I no longer have to literally feed dirt to a vaccum as I have with Wind Tunnels. I'm amazed that Consumer Reports continues to highly recommend those Hoovers; I have one in the garage whose belt broke every time I used it. Another one (I'm a slow learner) in the garage also doesn't work. Worse yet, I'm small and those puppies weigh a ton. The Miele is easy to take up and down stairs. I could sing its praises more, but it is a vaccum, afterall, and I'd sound like an idiot. Bottom line: buy it (and I assume their other vaccums are just as good).

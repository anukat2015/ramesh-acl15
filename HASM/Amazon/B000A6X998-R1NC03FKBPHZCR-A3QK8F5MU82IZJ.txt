Title: Too noisy.  Returned it.
Content:
I bought this to use in my office and bedroom at night.  The heat is very nice and warm.  But when it turns on, the noise is very loud and disturbs me while working and wakes me up when sleeping.  It's also fairly noisy during operation, but definitely that start-up is louder than I want to deal with. So I returned them today.

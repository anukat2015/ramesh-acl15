Title: Electrolux Intensity
Content:
We went out shopping for a new canister vacuum when my other one broke and stumbled up on this on clearance at BrandsMart for $88. It has awesome suction, cool design, and even gets around my baseboards since there is no hose. only drawback are the small bags. I have 2 dogs that shed and get pine straw and stuff stuck to their hair so I vacuum every couple days and I seem to be changing the bag after like 2-3 uses. We did go ahead and buy a few when we purchased but I am going to look into buying a large amount at once to save money. It is very lightweight and takes up very little space. We have hard woods, rugs, and carpet and it works well for all three. My living room rug has never looked so clean. I see why people pay the money for this brand.

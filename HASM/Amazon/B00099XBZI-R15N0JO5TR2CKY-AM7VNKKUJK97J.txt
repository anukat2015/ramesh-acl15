Title: Good for exercise
Content:
The 512 MB player doesn't hold a ton of songs, but is definitely enough room for songs to listen to while exercising. You'll want to purchase the arm strap specifically made for this player. It's available on the Creative site. The main buttons (on/off/pause; volume; and forward/back) are easy enough to work while jogging. The menu system is useless. For example, it let's you skip a folder, but nothing (on the menu or in the online documentation) tells you how to get it back in the play rotation.  I've had this player for over a year now and it has been on my arm while jogging in the elements (snow, rain, heat) practically every other day and is still functioning great. The ear buds that come with the player are pretty sad - they fall out and the foam pieces come off rather easily.  I finally had to replace them with something less annoying. 
Bottom line - if you can get this player cheaply, it's a good buy. Just don't expect it to be comparable to an iPod.

Title: Legacy Lenses OK!
Content:
I have been a loyal Pentax customer for the better part of 25 years. My first was a fully manual K1000 from 1981. ( Which by the way is still a great film camera ) I used that camera to fill the gap in-between great imaging, and quick imaging in which I use a "point and shoot" digital camera for my digital needs. 
     I have read reviews, and magazine ads waiting for a decent DSLR that can fill my all in one needs, and not fret about having hundreds of dollars of unused lenses, and filters in a case. 
     Well here it is! Though not really addressed in their ads at any length, The Pentax DSLR will indeed fit and use all their legasy K lenses!
NICE... all my zooms, wide angle, macro's and filters will be useful again in the 21st century. To my knowledge Canon, Olympus, Sony, etc have missed the consumer boat in engineering their cameras to use the lenses current customers already have in their posession. To be sure, the new lenses will allow for automatic metering, and focus. But for someone who already is comfortable in making my own exposures, and focusing, I can use my stock of lenses that were already invested in. 
     Thank you Pentax! 
     Oh and yes...ps... this camera does indeed make great images! Have no fear.

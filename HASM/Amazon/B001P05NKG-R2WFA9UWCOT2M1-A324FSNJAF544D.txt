Title: Went from a Dell to this
Content:
I gotta say, I have been nothing but happy with Mac. The computer runs really well and their customer service is top notch. I got this after my Dell crashed w/ the Blue Screen of death (no matter what I did that thing was never working) So, I invested in the macbook pro which is good for me because I am a filmmajor and this is what I need to use final cut. Great computer and great customer service. This was probably the best investment I made in my life!

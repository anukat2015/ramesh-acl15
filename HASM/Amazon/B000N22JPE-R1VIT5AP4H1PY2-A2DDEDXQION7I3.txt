Title: Still hoping for a great cup of coffee
Content:
After reading many reviews on many coffee makers, I finally decided to go with this Cuisinart.  I had to retire our Krups after 8 years and was eager to get a really good cup of coffee with a new coffee maker.  After only two pots, I regret buying this model.  It comes out much hotter than our Krups, but lacks the deep flavor I used to get with my old maker. I am using the recommended amount of grounds and filtered water so I expected to have delicious coffee.  I would return it but for the hassle of repackaging it so I will live with it and keep looking in the meantime.

Title: Still a pretty decent computer for some, but a MAJOR downgrade from previous generation.  No longer for creative Professionals
Content:
Good computer, but a major disappointment as it is downgraded in MANY ways from the previous model.  No longer useful for Art, Photography, Video professionals.  I have owned every upgrade to the Powerbook/Macbook Pro line for 9 years.  EVERY single one!  This is the first I had to return :(
First the good
-Very solid chassis, even more so than before.
-some of the benefits the previous generation had
-easier access to the hard drive for upgrade
-Improved Vid card
-Laptop that runs OSX, still the best operating system in use today!
The Bad (compared to the previous generation)
-Thinner by a hair, but wider and deeper yet a SMALLER battery?  Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)
-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)
-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)
-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean "for professionals"  this is definitely not the case anymore.   No button on the trackpad "neato" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)
-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)
-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.  
Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.
The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.  I would grab the absolute best of that generation, as it may be the last great model.

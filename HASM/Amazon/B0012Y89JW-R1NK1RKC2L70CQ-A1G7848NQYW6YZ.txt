Title: Fantastic for a photographer, overkill for snapshots
Content:
I'm really enjoying the Rebel XSi I purchased.  It has a tremendous amount of creative flexibility that really helps me to get the images I want.  Although the camera has several preset modes that essentially diversify it's point and shoot ability, the creative zones are the life of the camera.  If you aren't going to take the time to really study the manual, learn the equipment, and practice it's use - don't waste your money on any DSLR.  Buy a nice point-and-shoot and move on.  Having said that, it is nice to have the point-and-shoot mode for inexperienced spouses in addition to the creative zones.  If you ever worked with a manual 35mm slr or even the older computerized slr, this is a fantastic purchase.
A few small things to be aware of: 
1. You must purchase a top-end, super fast SD card if you want the camera to perform.  Don't cheap out on the card or there's no reason to buy this camera.  Be aware that the fast cards won't read in all card readers.
2. The packaged lens has Image Stabilization built in.  It's great for hand-held shooting, pushing your useable shutter speed 1 or 2 steps slower.   It's absolutely horrible for tripod shooting.  It will CREATE blur o long exposures if not turned off.  Fortunately, the on-off switch is easy to access on the lens
3. The camera feels kind of cheaply made.  I've had zero quality problems and don't expect to, but the touchy-feely could be a little better.  Of course, it shoots beautifully and I didn't buy it to pet.

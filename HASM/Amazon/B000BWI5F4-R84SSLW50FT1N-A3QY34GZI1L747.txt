Title: Quiet and great on pet-hair
Content:
I just removed all the wall-to-wall carpet in my house and replaced it with hardwood and area rugs, so I needed a new vacuum cleaner suited for the new floors. I originally had my heart set on the Miele, but I found that the Bosch had the same features at half the price, and it's still made in Germany.
It is sooooo quiet. My cat doesn't turn into a lighting-bolt and the kids don't scream at me. I like the variable suction control. I don't need much power on the hardwood, but when I suck up pet-hair from the area-rugs, I crank it up and it does great. I have very low, dense-pile rugs. I can imagine that this wouldn't work well at all on loose or deep-pile rugs. The attachment just isn't suitable for that.
I'm taller than most women, and I really like that it has an adjustable length on the wand, so I don't end up hunch-backed like I do with most vacuums. It's very light and maneuverable. I broke a rib a few days ago, but I was able to vacuum today. I never would have been able to do that with my old upright beast. All the wheels are rubber, so it doesn't marr the hardwood.
The only thing I don't like is the price of the replacement bags. I've ordered some original Bosch bags and also a set of generic bags to compare the performance of the two. The bags can also be difficult to find locally. I've only been able to find them online.

Title: Love the Shark hand vac!
Content:
I ordered this because I have two toddlers, crumbs and cheerios everywhere, and a really heavy Dyson (which is incredible for once a week cleanings but a pain to lug up and down stairs after every meal or snack).
The Shark sucks up everything.  I can use it for 30 seconds after each meal or snack, and the house actually looks like someone cares about it (if you ignore the rest of the toddler chaos).  
Really, really powerful for a hand vac.  If it starts to lose suction, you know it's time to clean the filter!  Clean filter = amazing suction!

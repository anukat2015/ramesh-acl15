Title: Nice Laptop - I'm Happy
Content:
Since my Dell laptop is seven years old, I've been looking for a replacement for the last few months. There are so many options that it was hard to make a choice. Since I bought a Sony Vaio for my wife recently - the VGN-NW270F, I had a good laptop to compare to this HP DV4.
You basically have two general choices to make: do you want a powerful laptop that can do lots of things, but has a shorter batter life or do you want a lighter less powerful laptop which has an extended life. I went with the power laptop which the HP is.
In general, I'm very happy and impressed. The HP is a bit smaller - 14" vs 15.6", but I actually prefer the smaller form factor. The 15.6 is more a desktop replacement size. They both have the same 320 GB hard drive and plenty of other ports and 4 GB or ram. I wanted an HDMI port and both have this feature. When you connect the HP to my 42" TV the screen looks sharp and stunning. I can now watch internet video and ripped movies on my big screen. One feature the Sony has is the ability to play Blue Ray disks, but since I don't own any of those, it's not a factor.
The HP does have a nice Recovery partition and a few other features, but I don't use them. The Sony has a better metal body, keyboard and track pad area (I use a real mouse.), but the HP is ok. 
Windows 7 is a joy to work with and even though I bought a manual, I haven't had to crack it open yet. I've gone from XP to Windows 7 without a hitch.
Pros
Fast bootup and performance
One click to turn wireless on and off.
Fantastic HDMI video to home TV
Cons
Case and keyboard not as nice as Sony Vaio.
Track area doesn't have the nice feel of a Sony
A little bit of junkware you need to uninstall.

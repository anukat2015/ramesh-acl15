Title: Pretty Good
Content:
I liked this coffee maker.  It was easy and pretty fast and the best part was the carafe.  It poured easily and neatly with no spills like you'd get from carafes with the little spouts.  
The bad things were that the automatic timer died after the first year and it has stopped working after about 2-1/2 years.  Also it seemed a little bit loud when it brewed.  It sounded like a steam engine in the morning with its bursts.  But that's not so bad, it it?  Hey, it's time to get out of bed and have some coffee!  Overall, for the money, I think it was a nice coffee maker.

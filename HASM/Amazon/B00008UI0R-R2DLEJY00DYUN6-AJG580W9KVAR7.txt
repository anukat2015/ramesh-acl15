Title: After one year
Content:
This could be the greatest vacuum cleaner of all time if it only had a bag.  If you own multiple long haired pets you especially will spend a good deal of time cleaning out the collection jar and the filter.  I seem to recall that bags were invented to avoid the messiness and dust flying all over the place which is just what happens with this vacuum.  Maybe if you live alone in a one bedroom apartment this is a great idea, but for a 2400 sq. ft house with family and pets--dumb technology.
Also the angled handle at the top makes it difficult to put a clothes hanger down the tube and dislodge jams that occasionally occur.
Note:  If you don't pull the cord all the way out, the unit will overheat and shut down.  Don't panic as I did; just wait for it to cool, pull the cord all the way out, and it eventually will reset.

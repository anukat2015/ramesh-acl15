Title: This product is a joke
Content:
I bought RS ARP-900E Portable Air Conditioner - 9000 BTU from Fry's yesterday. It is over $400. Today I am going to return it. Of course, it only takes a few minutes to set up and very easy for anyone to operate it. We set it up and tried for a few hours, and then we feel extremely disappointed. If you live in the South and your room's temperature reaches 90 F and you wish to use a portable air conditioner to cool the room down, good luck.  This product can only cool a little spot where it is pointing. The vent hose gets very hot and you can feel the heat like a little stove behind the air conditioner. So it cools down the air in one spot and heats up the air in another spot of the room. I read a customer's review before who believed to give it 10 years for the technology to develop.  Now, I understand why he/she said that. I'll say to give it over 15 years for engineers to work on it before it is put on markets.

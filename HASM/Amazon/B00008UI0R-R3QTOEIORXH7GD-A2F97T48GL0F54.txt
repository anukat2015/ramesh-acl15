Title: Can't beat it for the price!
Content:
I researched a lot of vacuums before purchasing this one. It does a great job and we couldn't be more pleased. We have almost all hardwood floors and this doesn't scratch them at all. The attachments are handy and enable you to get around chairs, under couches, etc. Good power, easy manuvering, nice retractable cord. The "dust bin" is easy to empty and doesn't make me sneeze all over the place like my old vacuum. This is our first canister and I would definately recommend it for folks with hardwood floors. Trust me, you don't need the $400 vacuum! We have a giant dog and 2 cats and this picks up all the animal fur.

Title: Problems solved
Content:
1. Shutting off automatically= Problem fixed by updating bios from www.toshiba.com2. Trouble reading CD contents and reading DVDS = unchecked the box for enabling digital cd in My computer's cd drive propertiesUnfixed things, Fan is a bit loud, and notebook on heavy side.  Besides these, it is a solid, reasonably priced notebook great for students or researchers.

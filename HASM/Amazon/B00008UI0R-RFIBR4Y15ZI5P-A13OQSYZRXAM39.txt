Title: This Sucks!!!!
Content:
Literally....the Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel has great suction!  It is awesome at removing pet hair from carpet.  Tools are easy to use and interchange.  Works great on hard wood floors.  This cannister vac is lightweight and rolls with great ease.  My only complaint would be inadequate tool storage.  This vac is a great buy for the money!

Title: Why Go Digital?
Content:
Choosing my first "real" digital camera proved to be a bewildering task! As I already had a nice selection of Canon L series lenses,I didn't consider other brands of cameras. Should I go with the budget Rebel series or opt for the (expensive) full frame cameras? A trip to the local camera store quickly ruled out the Rebel cameras as I felt they were a little small for my hands and a bit too light weight (I hesitate to say "toy-like" but I have become used to 
carrying a moderately heavy camera). Given the rapid evolution of the digital SLR camera, I'll bet an affordable full frame camera will appear within a few years, so I backed off purchasing a Canon 5d for the time being. The 40d (with the current rebate) fit my budget and offered enough features to make it appear to be the best buy. 
  Using the 40d makes me wonder my I was so timid about jumping on the digital bandwagon. Especially appreciated is the ability to adjust the ISO as needed and the instant gratification of seeing an image immediately after making an exposure. I figure the camera will soon pay for itself by eliminating the need to process and print the exposures I would consider "failures."
  I haven't really used the camera enough to make a full evaluation, but I suspect the 40d will prove to be as solid as my old F1 and EOS 1n 35mm cameras. Will the 40d make me a better photographer? Probably not! But considering the camera as a tool, it is a very nice machine.

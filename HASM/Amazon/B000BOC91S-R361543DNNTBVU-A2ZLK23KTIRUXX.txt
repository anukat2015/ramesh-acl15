Title: Does exactly as it says.
Content:
I have owned this for a couple of days now and this thing works just like it's suppose to. I did a test with a digital temperature probe and the air out was 20 degrees cooler than the air in. I do live in an area that has daytime humidity of less than 10% which is great for an evaporative cooler. In my situation it cools a room very well that is approximately 400 square feet.

Title: MacBook Pro is a Pro
Content:
I replaced my older Mac laptop with the MacBook Pro 15, and it's a world of difference.  The machine is quick, sleek, easy to operate and has very few glitches.  My problems have to do with the keyboard.  Although highly-touted (and the backlit feature is great), it's not great for a fast typist.  I also have a problem with the touchpad. It's not as accurate as some of the past models, sometimes reacting way too quickly and sometimes not responding.  Overall, though, it's a great notebook computer.

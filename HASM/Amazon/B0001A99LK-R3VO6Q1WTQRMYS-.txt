Title: Perfect iPod for the gym
Content:
I purchase my iPod Mini about 2 weeks ago, and it is everything I hoped it would be: lightweight, compact, puts out great sound, and holds more than enough music for working out, and will even get me through the work day without having to hear the same song twice, and I've only filled it up half way.Why the 4-star rating instead of 5? Well, the battery life indicator seems to be off. It can be fully charged, but only show half-power on the icon sometimes. I'm not sure if this is result of not conditioning the battery, or a design flaw. Also, on mine, the round scroll control wheel is slightly off-center (the wheel is set at a bit of an angle so the text is tilted). Also, because you can get another 11GB of storage space (plus added weight and size) for $50 more, the value isn't all that it could be. Of course, if you take Apple's suggestion that you shouldn't compare the Mini to other iPods but to flash-based MP3 players, this isn't a consideration.Also, the iTunes software (I used the Windows version) and store are great. Very easy to use, and it's a good deal at $9.99 an album.

Title: Piece of trash
Content:
This product worked ok for a few months. Then I started having problems with connecting to the computer with both XP and Vista on different PCs. Error message: USB device not recognized. This was with updated firmware. Search on Google revealed many complaints with this issue with no real solution other than the product or wire is defective. 
Also it had trouble renewing download rights with Rhapsody when it was able to connect to the computer, it often took 3 or more tries to get that to work properly. 
Then the earphone jack stopped working correctly, there were crackling noises and one of the head phones would not work unless the jack were twisted just the right way. 
Oh and let's not forget that the crystal glass surface developed scratches after a few months of nominal use. 
I am now back to Ipod and will never purchase another Sandisk product again. I guess you get what you pay for.

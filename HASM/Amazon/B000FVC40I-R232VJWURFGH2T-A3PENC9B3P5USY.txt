Even though this model is not the top of the honeywell line, I'm glad I made the decision to go with it.  I have three other brands in my home and none can compete with this model.  Heat fills the room quickly and there is a positive difference in the electric bill.  And by the way....I shopped around and couldn't find anyone that beat the amazon price.

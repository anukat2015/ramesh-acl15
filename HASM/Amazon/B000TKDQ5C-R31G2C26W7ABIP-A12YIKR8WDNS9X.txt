Title: Cute little thing!
Content:
I've had this for over six months now, and I can't believe it still works. It's small but mighty, great price too.
I use it all the time, it's semi-quiet. The cons: sometimes I think it blows air towards the back instead of the front and it's impossible to clean unless you take it apart.

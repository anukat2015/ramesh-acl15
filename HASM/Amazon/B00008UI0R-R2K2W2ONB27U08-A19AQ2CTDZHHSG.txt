Title: Zip, zoom, zuck!
Content:
I can't give this item 5 stars -part of the overall quality will be its longevity.  But so far it is a great sucker and I like the bagless system, and the filter you clean instead of replace.  It is a little heavy and awkward toting it around the house.  The canister needs to be emptied almost everytime I use it, so I wish it held more volume.  The little furniture attachment is wonderful.  OH!  The light on the front of the vacuum is ridiculous.  It does not aim towards the ground, so the only good it does is tell you that it is "on".  Most important is that something in the styling and sound makes my husband want to use it!

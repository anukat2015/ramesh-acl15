Title: archos 705
Content:
Before I give the cons I have to say this is the best PVP on the market.  Although this is all I wish an Ipod was it's not something that can be placed in your pocket.  It is big and bulky but with all the storage and the big 7 inch screen it's made to watch video.  The DVR attachment is also a good feature and works great.  No need to rent or buy a DVR from your cable provider as it plays through your TV.  Now for my cons.  This unit is a touch screen operation and one stylus is supplied but there is nowhere to store it in or on the unit or in the supplied case.  Even the inexpensive PDA's have somewhere to store the stylus.  I would imagine many will be lost along the way (they could always be stored behind your ear).  Also they sync up the music library with Windows media player but the player itself doesn't look at all like Media player 11.  It is somewhat boaring.  Archos chose to use Opera operating system, why I'm not sure.  They could have done better.  All said not every player has everything (not yet anyway) but this one comes close.  If size matter and you want a smaller PVP the 605 WI FI is just as good for about $100 less.

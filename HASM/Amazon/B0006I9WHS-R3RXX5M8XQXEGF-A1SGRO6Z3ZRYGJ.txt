Title: Call the fire department!
Content:
I bought my Honeywell heater to use in my office in the winter.  It worked okay for the first season, but I had it plugged into a power strip and you had to keep checking the strip to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. Even so, one power strip started smoking and burned. A colleague borrowed the heater and plugged it directly into the wall, and later, smoke and sparks started to pour out of the outlet!  The electrician said the entire outlet had melted and burned inside the wall.  Needless to say, I have now thrown the heater away. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you live next door to the fire station.

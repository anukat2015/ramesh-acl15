Title: Love love this Hoover!
Content:
After suffering through three upright vacuums, reverted back to a cannister model. Read your reviews and decided on this model.
Love love love this vacuum! It is powerful, easy to use, easy to empty and it is exactly as advertised. Has two handy attachments, the only two you ever use and they are safely stored on top so will still be there in years to come.
I will never buy an upright again, this is the only style for me, if anything were to get stuck, I can easily fix it. I certainly recommend this vacuum and recommend buying from Amazon, speedy delivery, free delivery and no tax! The best!

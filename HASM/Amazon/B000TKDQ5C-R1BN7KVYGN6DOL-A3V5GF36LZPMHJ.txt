Title: Great little heater, great little price
Content:
I bought 2 of these heaters for my kids rooms. The side of the house they are on is not heated well and I needed a way to compensate for it. I put one of these heaters in each bedroom, which are fairly average sized (one is about 10x15, the other is a bit smaller). Both rooms also have doors to the outside which are pretty drafty. These heaters warm up the room in about 5 minutes and keep them warm and comfortable. I recommend these for heating up any room that is not heated well or perhaps does not have heat. It should head the room quite nicely.

Title: Great for Me (a beginner)
Content:
I did alot of reaserch before i chose this camera. And i am so glad i did. It is everything the articals and amazon told me it would be.
I am a amiture photographer and love shooting outside. I could not have chosen a better camera. I love that with the lens you can be in Auto mode (for regular family photos) and then change to manual (for the great art shots) I am very happy with this camera. 
Just remember it is like a set of lego's. you always want more! Another lens or another filter or a different strap. Try and pace yourself and see what other people have before you get sucked into the Photographers black hole of buying equipment.

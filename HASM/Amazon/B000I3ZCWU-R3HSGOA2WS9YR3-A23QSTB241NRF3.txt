Title: LOVE IT!
Content:
I bought this camera about a year and a half ago, and have NEVER had any problems with it. I've taken thousands of photos, and so far, everything works perfectly. I'm amazed at the clarity of the pictures I've taken with it. I rarely get a bad shot. 
I'm curious about the problems people have listed in their negative reviews. Based on my personal experience, and the experiences of many of my friends who own the same camera, I'd have to say user error on the part of any negative reviews on this product. I figure if you can't figure out how to use an XTI (or one of the newer models Canon has out now) then you might want to try out a lower quality camera such as a Nikon. Nikon produces lesser quality, substandard cameras that won't make you feel bad if they break. Canon cameras are more professional, higher quality products and shouldn't be just given to any child to play with. If you want to give a child a camera to play around with, ANY nikon will do. Leave Canon cameras to REAL PROFESSIONALS.
I highly recommend a Canon Digital Rebel XTI to anyone who is looking for a true professional camera. 
Praise the Lord for my flawless Canon.
Amen.

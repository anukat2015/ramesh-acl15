Title: what a ripp off!!!!
Content:
I BOUGHT THIS VACUUM THINKING I WAS GETTING MY MOTHERS ELECTROLUX! IT WAS ON SALE !!! BOY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I COULD NOT GET THE BAGS, THEN WHEN IT BROKE I COULD NOT GET THE PARTS. I CALLED THE ELECTROLUX DEALER NEAR MY HOME . AND  HE EXPLAINED IT WAS MADE BY EUREKA!!! IF I WANTED THE REAL ELECTROLUX I HAD TO LOOK FOR AERUS ELECTROLUX. BOY IS THIS DECIEVING!! I RETURNED IT AND BOUGHT AN AERUS AND ARE VERY HAPPY.

OK, so I've been a Windows guy for years.  This is my first Apple product.  This is one of the best engineered products that I've had the pleasure of owning.  From the very responsive touch screen, the WiFi access, the zoom/pan touch screen, and the small form factor that works well in a pocket during a workout, this unit has it.  I liked the Touch so much, I put it on eBay and sold it.  I went ahead and bought an iPhone.
My only complaint with a lot of these portable players is that the amplifier is just isn't strong enough as there is some distortion when there is a fair amount of bass in a passage.  But, this isn't an Apple only problem.

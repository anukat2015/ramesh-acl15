Title: A coffee maker's a coffee maker, right?
Content:
That's what I thought before I got the Bunn. The coffee actually tastes better and brews faster. I was concerend about having the heat unit on all the time that keeps the reserve hot, but we have brewed coffee almost every day for the 4 months we've had it. I would treat myself to a starbucks occasionally, but I don't want to anymore. I bought some vanilla syrup and enjoy my own coffee just as much. It brews super fast, so even running late I can get a cuppa for the road. This coffee maker rocks.

Title: Do not recommend
Content:
Does not do a good job. Does not have much suction power so it cannot such up anything beyond very small items in carpet. One reason for this is the vacuum piping gets clogged up very easily. Should have been designed with a bigger pipe and/or filter at front to prevent anything that can clog the pipe from entering. Every so often you need to take the whole machine apart to clean out the pipe. Bad purchase.

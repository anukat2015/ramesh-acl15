Title: Disappointing
Content:
I owned the previous incarnation of the WindTunnel cannister and loved it.  It worked for many years, and the suction was very powerful.  When it came time to replace it, I was sure the new version would be great.  I have owned this vacuum for about six months now, but I was disappointed with it out of the box. The suction is nowhere close to as strong as my older Hoover.  This vac does not pick up popcorn or anything greater than "pea" sized unless you make sure you position the attachment directly over the item, and usually not even then.  Twice now, the hose has clogged.  The design of this vac makes it nearly impossible to clean out the hose without taking the handle apart with a screw driver.  I find it irritating, too, that the tool compartment will not open when the vac is on.  I have to power it down first--pretty frustrating after a while.  I'm surprised at the number of high reviews on this product. I've owned several great vacuums in my life, but this is definitely not one of them.

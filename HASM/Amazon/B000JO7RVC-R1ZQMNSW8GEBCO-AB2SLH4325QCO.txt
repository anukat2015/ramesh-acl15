Title: Good value
Content:
I ordered the 6th generation classic iPod from the Amazon store. Doing so actually saved me $15, as opposed to purchasing it from the Apple store, either online or in person. Better still, I saved that much even after selecting one day shipping. And I was also able to register my iPod for the one year warranty without any problems. 
As for the product: I've now had my iPod for a month. Thus far, I have no complaints. It's incredibly easy to use. I also use my iPod for transferring files. It's convenient, multifunctional and unequivocally money well spent.

Title: Loved it so much, bought 3 for the family
Content:
Bought the first one for my college-age daughter, who just loved it.  She has a docking station at her desk so she can quickly disconnect and throw it in her backpack.  Case is magnesium and built like a tank.  Dual-core processor is an order of magnitude faster than the Atom in netbooks.  Even with a 6-hour battery, whole thing weighs maybe 3.5 pounds.  Great keyboard, too.
Anyway, I loved the first unit so much, I bought a second one for myself, then a third for the wife.  Great machines, and now you can easily find them for $250 on eBay or as refurbs.  To me, WAY more sense than a netbook.  You can get serious work done on this thing, and it's still small and light.

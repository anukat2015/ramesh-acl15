Title: Good for Basic Heating
Content:
This little heater does a great job at its basic function- creating heat quickly in a localized area.  It is great when set on the high or low setting, or with the highest of the thermostat settings (80 degrees) it WILL cycle off and on again. 
Unfortunately, the "thermostat" controls simply do not work the way they should.  I have not had success with any of the lower thermostat settings (in 5 degree increments, going down to 60).  The unit simply did not turn on, despite the ambient temperature.
When I use this heater in my studio apartment I point it right at myself as I am sitting at my computer desk or towards my bed at night.  This was a great help in the Fall, when it was cold in the apartment but the heat hadn't been turned on in the building yet.  Occasionally there has been a warm day where the apartment heat didn't come on but it was still too cool outside to be comfortable with open windows.  It is nice to have this little heater on hand for intermittent use. 
Next time I will look for a version with a cool fan option, (for some reason I thought this had a cool setting, but it does not) and I will buy one without the thermostat, since it does not work well.

Title: this product is okay
Content:
THIS HEATER IS MUCH SMALLER THAN IT APPEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS SMALL, IT DOES THE JOB. THE HEAT BLOWS OUT AT FULL BLAST! THE NEAGATIVE WITH THIS HEATER IS THAT IT HAS NO OFF BUTTON. YOU CAN TURN IT ON BY TURNING THE KNOB AND THE HIGHER IT'S TURNED DETERMINES HOW OFTEN IT WILL GO ON AND OFF. IT CUTS ON AND OFF, BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN IT WOULD MAKE A ROOM EXTREMELY WARM. BUT OVERALL IT'S A NICE HEATER.

Title: SO FAR SO GOOD
Content:
This Acer laptop met all the specs I was looking for, at a price that was affordable.  It has met my expectations in every way.  The other customer reviews were good and helped me in my decision.  I did find that it's wireless connectivity was a bit weaker than other laptops.  When I was side-by-side with a friend who has a similar laptop by another maker, he was getting stronger signal reception and picking up more available connections than my Acer. Still, when I am in a wireless hotspot I do get good signal from that source. A few minor questions that led me to call ACER Tech Support were handled promptly, and in a very friendly and helpful manner. The only real problem that I had was that the system froze when I tried to burn the back-up DVD as instructed at initial bootup.  But Acer Tech Support again came through, cleared the Laptop, and mailed me the backups.

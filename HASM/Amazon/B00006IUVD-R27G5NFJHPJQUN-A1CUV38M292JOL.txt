Title: Very Happy with this coffee maker!
Content:
My apartment kitchen has no counter space. Reason for purchase #1. Bought one for my mom - loves it! Just purchased another one for work.  Works great.  Just the right size & price!!  I use the Melitta #1 filters @ work. Easier to clean. I decided to buy one after a co-worker let me use the one she keeps at work. Takes up very little space. The noise it makes does not bother me at all. Don't have to worry about coffee getting old sitting in a pot!

Title: Don't hesitate to buy
Content:
I purchased this product after my Kenmore hose split and it would cost me more to have Kenmore (or anyone else for that matter) repair it then to buy a new vacuum cleaner.  I always liked the canister model.  This one has so much power and it's so light weight.  The power head for carpeting does a wonderful job and the floor brush is much wider than most so it covers more floor in one sweep.  So far, I haven't had it long, I can't find anything wrong with it and the price is definitely right.  It's also bagless, so you save on bags.

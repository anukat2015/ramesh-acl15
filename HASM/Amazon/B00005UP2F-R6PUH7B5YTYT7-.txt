Title: Dirty, loud and ineffective
Content:
This is the worst vacuum cleaner I've ever bought and used and I do not recommend it, as even 159 USD (at the time I bought it)is too much for that model.The vacuum cleaner is extremely loud and noisy (even more noisy on wooden floor with its plastic wheels). Rather than sucking in the dirt, the revolving brushroll spreads it around. Cleaning the vacuum cleaner is a total nightmare, as by emptying out the dirt compartment into the trash can, I am covered by the dust particles and forced to breethe them in if I want to have it properly emptied. The filter in the dirt compartment is clogged with dust and dirt after each use.(I already bought the 3rd filter after using that vacuum cleaner for 6 months!!) I am still wondering why this vacuum cleaner has 2 dust filters, etc. , if there is no bag which keeps the dust when cleaning it. I do not recommend this product if you are an allergic or have asthma problems. I personally will go back and buy a vacuum cleaner with a proper dust bag and one without motorized revolving brushroll. This vacuum cleaner definitely needs improvement!

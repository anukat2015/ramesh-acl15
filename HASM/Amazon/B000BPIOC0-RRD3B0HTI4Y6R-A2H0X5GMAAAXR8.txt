Title: Good little heater
Content:
First I got one Honeywell surround heater which kind of disappointed me because of the lack of airflow. After a little while I got this and I was happy with this. Keeps my room nice and warm.
Pros:
- Nice heating power.
- 2 heat and 1 fan mode.
- Thermal cut-off (or something like that).
- Good airflow.
Cons:
- No thermostat.
- No tip over protection or other safety features (except one mentioned).
- Little too loud.
- Doesn't seem to stand very sturdy (not good if you have kids around).
Overall this is a good product and I would recommend it.

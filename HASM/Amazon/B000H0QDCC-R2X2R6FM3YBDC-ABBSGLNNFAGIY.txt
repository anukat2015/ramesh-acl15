Title: ZUNE
Content:
i just got my zune a couple days ago, i had read many of the reviews, alot of people were bumbed at the zune because the software didn't work or something like that... well i got mine everything worked great, all my friends have ipods(most are on their second or third because the first two had stopped working for some reason) and i took a chance with the zune i now i wouldn't trade it for anything, everything works perfectly, and the display is slick lookin and easy to use.
to all those who think the zune is a failure they should probably go out and try a zune out before writing reviews about them because its a really great product.

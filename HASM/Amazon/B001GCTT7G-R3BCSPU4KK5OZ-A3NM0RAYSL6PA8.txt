Title: Five very solid stars -- plus a few things you should know.
Content:
Who'd have thunk that Bill Gates would be bribing people to pan the new MacBook on Amazon?  Yet, the proof is in the pudding.  The new MacBook is, frankly, the best consumer laptop Apple has every sold, and I've owned just about all of them.  It's also the finest consumer laptop out there, but, I suppose, I'm repeating myself.  Yes, there are a few folks who elevate the lack of a FireWire port to the kiss of death, or complain about the "quality" of the screen, even though it is the same quality screen that made its appearance in the last iteration of the MacBook -- and, more importantly, it's a damn fine screen that no reasonable user could find fault with.  It's bright, vivid and clear, backlit by LEDs that truly make it quick to light up, easy on the eyes, and a beautiful display for watching videos or slide shows.  Those who complain are a lot like the folks who could be convinced that tap water is actually Norwegian glacier drippings, or that hand-rolled oregano is a joint.  Finding fault with the screen is just plain silly.  But, don't trust me.  Truck down to your local Apple store and take  a look for yourself.  It will really blow you away.  And as for FireWire, it would be a more versatile laptop if it was included, since a lot of older camcorders are FireWire only, and, as of yet, there is no FIreWire to USB 2 converter available to consumers.  My guess is that there will be in short order, but that's for another day.  So, if you really want to do FireWire downloading to your Mac, get an iMac or a MacBook Pro.  Simple as that.
But, here's why those petty complaints don't mean a tinker's cuss. First, this is a rock solid laptop, pressed from a solid block of aluminum and virtually scratch-proof.  It's expensive to produce this kind of light rigidity (no one else machines their laptops from aircraft grade aluminum), but it turns out to be indispensable for a workhorse portable. The MacBook opens and closes and feels like a fine Swiss watch. Going from the MacBook to any of its competitors is like going from fine Japanese or German sports car to a Chevy Impala -- the kind with chintzy appointments and cheap doors.  The kind that folds up in a crash.  Are you going to pay a bit of a premium for that kind of quality? Sure. But, even with this kind of off the charts fit and finish, the MacBook only costs $1299 -- and you can get an Apple certified refurbished unit for hundreds less.  But here's the real beauty part.  Apple laptops hold their value -- just like Hondas and Toyotas. I trade mine in every two years to get the latest and greatest, and usually get more than 50% of the purchase price in a trade in.  Try that with your Dell or HP.  They'll laugh you out of the computer store, and then the best you'll be able to do is to try to sell it as a commodity product on eBay for parts, maybe.  
But, apart from the terrific screen and off-the-charts build, you get an amazingly solid operating system that virtually never crashes. Sometimes an application with quit on you, but even that's rare.  And the OS X just keeps on keeping on. It's a thing of beauty, and the next version (Snow Leopard) is designed to take advantage of the MacBook's architecture to achieve blazing speed.  Not that the current version (Leopard) isn't plenty fast. It is. And then you have software programs have no equal in the Windows world for both elegance and ease of use. Just give OmniGraffle or Keynote a try if you don't believe me. Sure, there are some specialty Windows programs that aren't available for OS X.  No problem.  You can run Windows on your MacBook -- either by directly booting into it, or via fine emulation programs like Fusion.  Note: If you want to run heavy duty games, you probably should drop a few hundred more bucks for the MacBook Pro.  But, since most of those games suck, and are better off being played on a console or desktop computer, why bother?
Seamless integration with your iPod or iPhone, the great, exclusive software, a crash-proof operating system, and a beautiful design of both strength and lasting beauty ... don't listen to the MacBook bashers here. They truly have no clue as to what counts in a laptop or what consumers both need and want.  Frankly, I think they're just looking for attention, and to rally around some irrational clinging to their Windows laptops which they probably got on the cheap (you get what you pay for) or paid too much for and got little in return.

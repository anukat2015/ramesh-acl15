Title: Buy One of These
Content:
I bought this gem to replace my 10 inch Asus atom driven netbook. The atom netbook is great for size and mobility but just to slow. It would take 15 minutes to load up. This guy is quick. Also I find Windows 7 to be very smooth. I was a little worried that the 11.6 inches would be too big after I went to Fry's and looked at the 12-13 inch options on display, but it's perfect for carrying around the house and traveling. Everybody should own one of these--well worth the price. Great job ACER!

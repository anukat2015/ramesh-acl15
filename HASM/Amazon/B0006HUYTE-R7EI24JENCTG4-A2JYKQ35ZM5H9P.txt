Title: featherweight, but powerful
Content:
Strong features of this vacuum are its very light weight and its quite adequate power.  The relatively low price is also a real "plus."  The hose on this vacuum tends to coil on itself, so there's often some effort required to straighten it out.  However, the vacuum has a telescoping wand that is terrific for getting into tight places.  I've been running the vacuum for only a few weeks, so its long-term performance remains to be seen.  However, having had a top-of-the line Hoover require three costly repairs in six years (!) even mid-term endurance for the moderate cost Sanitaire will be a real improvement.

Title: Pretty good coffee machine
Content:
I have been using this machine for about a month now, and reckon it's pretty good.It's easy to use and makes a good cup. 
The lid to the reservior could use a little tweak in its design, as it drips condensation on the counter when you open it. You also need to be careful filling the reservoir, as there isn't a very large opening to aim for.
I do like the features, being able to set how long the burner stays warm and how hot the burner gets is nice. The clock and auto start features are both easy to use. 
Let's hope that it has longer life than the last two coffee machines I bought.

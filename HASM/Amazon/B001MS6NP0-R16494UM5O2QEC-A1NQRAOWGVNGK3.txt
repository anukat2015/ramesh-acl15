Title: So Far, So Good!
Content:
After researching the best pink laptop for a couple of months, I chose this Sony. This is my first laptop and I am a very basic computer user. It contains all but 1 of the best options I wanted. The color is beautiful and it operates great. I have purchased numerous items from the Internet and this is one of the top items I am very pleased with. I read numerous reviews like this to assist me in my decision and purchase.

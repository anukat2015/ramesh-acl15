Title: Great laptop in small package
Content:
I chose this model because I wanted a computer with the portability of a netbook with the power of a full sized notebook. I've been very pleased with it. Very quick computing, nice screen that's easy to look at for long periods of time (because lord knows I do), and GREAT battery life. I have only come close to running the battery down once. The only minor points I want to mention are:
-The small keyboard takes some getting used to. I made lots of typing errors until I adjusted to the smaller key size.
-The power cord tends to come unplugged from the laptop rather easily, with just a light tug.
But those are just minor quibbles. All in all, I'm very satisfied, and happy I went with this computer.

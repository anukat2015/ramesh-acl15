Title: Outstanding purchase.
Content:
We purchased this camera about 2 months ago and have been nothing but pleased with its performance thus far. What you have in this Canon Rebel XT is all of the function, expandability, and speed of your standard SLR teamed with the convenience and flexibility of digital photography with Canon Quality. I don't think you can beat the quality to price ratio on this Camera - it's the sort of investment that we won't be kicking ourselves for 3 years down the road.
The Pros:
1. As stated, function, expandability, and speed of an SLR built into a digital Camera.
2. The camera is built to last for quite some time - it's durable in its construction and the 8MP capability will produce super prints for years to come.
3. The battery: The life has been phenomenal so far - I don't think that I've seen the meter drop below "full," while taking photographs, and that's at taking over 400 photos at a time (not all at once though, of course). Plus, it's rechargeable - Kudos to Canon for their forward thinking
4. Speed, Speed, Speed. The camera acts just like a 35mm which means that it has a pretty fast processor. 
5. Cost - a very economical choice considering what you have in this camera.
The Cons:
1. Expect it to be heavy, because it is. 
2. There's no built in memory. So buy a compact flash card when you buy this camera as you will need it.
3. Related to the above: A good compact flash card is not necessarily "cheap."
Altogether, this camera is worth it. Buy a 1GB Compact flash and you'll be able to take more pictures at one time than most will need.

Title: Worth the Price
Content:
At first I wasn't convinced with this iPod because of the controls, but I have since come to enjoy them. I have had mine for about a month and the control still works fine, the headphones still sound great and I have enjoyed the portability that the design allows. It's a great iPod if you want to upgrade your old Shuffle for more memory or if you are replacing a higher end iPod.

Title: Terrible, terrible, terrible
Content:
I purchased two of these heaters last winter and I couldn't have been more disappointed. Neither heater made it through the winter. 
The major problem with these heaters is the thermostat. They can't seem to gauge the temperature in the room accurately. I had to set the heater to it's highest setting, overheat the room, and then turn the heater off to achieve any level of warmth in the relatively mild San Diego winter.  This juggling act would continue until I went to bed. Then I had to play another juggling act with the heater I had in my bedroom and hope I didn't fall asleep before the room was warm so I could adjust the thermostat so as not to not wake up in a sauna or a refrigerator. More nights than not this didn't happen and I woke up drenched in sweat or shivering.
Perhaps even more annoying than the juggling act was the sound of the heater constantly turning on and off. Any mid level setting would cause the heaters to turn on for a few seconds, then off for a few seconds creating a "whisp" sound as the fan spun up. Repeat over several hours. All winter long. My girlfriend hated the noise so much that she begged me many nights to turn them off and just live with the cold.
By the end of the winter the thermostat in one heater would never engage, no matter what settings were made, and the other would turn on so intermittently that it ended up providing no heat even with the settings maxed. Both heaters are now completely useless. 
Stay away from this heater. Far away.

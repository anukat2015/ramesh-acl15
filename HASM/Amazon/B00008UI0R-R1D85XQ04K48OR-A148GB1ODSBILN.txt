Title: Beware
Content:
Buyer beware.  I bought this vacuum nine months ago.  It does a good job vacuuming but it is already falling apart.  The screws came out of the body separating the top and bottom, the hose is leaking, the electronics have a mind of their own and the winder cord only works at random.  It is very heavy to use, children find it very difficult and awkward to use.  I contacted Hoover as soon as it started to fall apart.  They were worthless and happy to have more of my money by offering that I take it to a repair shop.

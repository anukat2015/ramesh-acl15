Title: filter not included
Content:
the heater puts out good heat,and convienent, perfect for my conversion van while scouting for fossils on cold days! NOTE Manufacturer strongly recommends using a fuel filter. (which is not included) to my knowledge they are the only person who makes them. They sell for around $10 including shipping, and should be replaced annually. Without it propane liquid can enter the hose/heater if it is moved while in use, causing it to smoke and rendering it noxious and unuseable.

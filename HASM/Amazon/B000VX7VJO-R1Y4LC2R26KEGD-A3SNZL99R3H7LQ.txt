Title: Love It!
Content:
After searching around for a single-cup brewer, I finally settled on this product.  This was after seeing the positive reviews here on Amazon.  At first, I was not too keen on the fact of using K-Cups, but now after a few weeks of use, I realize that they are very convenient and generally the coffee or tea tastes pretty darn good.  Also, with the My K-Cup, I can use whatever ground beans I so desire which eliminates the need to be soley dependent on other K-Cups.  All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it.

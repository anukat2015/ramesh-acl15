Title: A little more control would be nice...
Content:
Our new percolator, whom we have named "Bubbles," makes a pretty good cup of coffee on occasion, but a little more control over the length of brew time would be a welcome feature. Our previous percolator, "Betty," had this ability and, since both my wife and I like a stronger cup of coffee, it is one we should have included in our purchase considerations. There are times when all we get is a cup of hot water, which seems more like a defect than anything else.
While Bubbles makes a good cup of coffee sometimes, the price is reasonable, and we are working hard to adjust. Like Betty, she also emits an almost erotic series of moans and sobs throughout the percolating process.
I miss Betty.

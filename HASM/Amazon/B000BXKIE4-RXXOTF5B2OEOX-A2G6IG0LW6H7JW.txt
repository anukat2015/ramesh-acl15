Title: Buy Miele, as you get what you pay for!!!!!
Content:
Check for Warranty Repair Locations at the website prior to purchase... Our machine worked well given the positive Consumer Reports rating and low price for 6.5 months.  After that time, it failed to turn on.  The only repair location was a UPS trip away and it had to be fixed out of warranty, which means out of pocket.  Electrolux Customer Service is abysmal!  After calling and checking the website for repair locations and finding none within reasonable range, I proceeded to send an email to request a perhaps unknown site.  They responded 1 week later without detail and simply suggested I consult the website for alternatives.  By that time the machine had already been fixed, without their help, out of warranty, and for 25% of purchase price.  The entire circuit board needed to be replaced, which I have found to be a common problem and no easy task to fix at home.  Steer clear of this machine if you dont want hidden costs associated with sudden failure and inept and nonexistent customer service.  We miss our pricey, but oh so reliable, Miele that was worth every penny!  A vacuum should last more than 6.5 months!

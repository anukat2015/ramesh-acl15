Title: Awesome Vacuum!
Content:
This vacuum replaced a nearly 30 year-old Hoover cannister vacuum. That old vacuum did what we thought was an excellent job on our carpets, in fact, we had been told by several people working in the vacuum repair business that we would not find a new vacuum that worked nearly as well. So we kept fixing our old one until it finally just died. 
I did a lot of research before buying the Hoover S3765-040. I knew I wanted a cannister vac because they are easier to use on stairs. I couldn't see spending upwards of $300 on a vacuum. I checked the leading consumer ratings on vacuums and then the ratings on Amazon. I find that the ratings of real people are generally more reliable than product testing.
Even though this model was a "best buy" on another site, it still did not get rave reviews. Well, we love it! We have two dogs and a cat and contrary to what the consumer website said, this vacuum picks up loads of pet hair. It works equally as well on carpets and bare floors. And the edger is awesome! Previously I had to use an attachment to vacuum along the baseboards. No longer! The only drawback I can see is that the first few times using it, we quickly filled the cannister. But I think that was because the vacuum was picking up all of the dirt and pet hair our older vacuum left behind. This vacuum is quieter than the old one too.
The cost of the Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum was money well spent. An awesome vacuum at an affordable price.

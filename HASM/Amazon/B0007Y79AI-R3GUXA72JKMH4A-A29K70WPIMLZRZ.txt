Title: Must Have Item
Content:
Perfect for first-time iPod buyers!  Easy to use; excellent size for an active person whether running, hiking or traveling anywhere in the world.  Important to note: if you want to use your iPod while traveling without computer access, you will need a wall adapter charger (just plug it into an outlet while waiting for your flight. You can listen to your tunes while charging). The optional arm band is a good add-on for easy handsfree usage. Only disappointed that it didn't have more playtime with charges and sometimes it had the tendency to skip.

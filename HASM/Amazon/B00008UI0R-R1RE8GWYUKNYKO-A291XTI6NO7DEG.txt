Title: Best vacuum we have had.  And no more bags!
Content:
I'll keep it short:
No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.  We did a side by side comparison of another upright vacuum, and this pulled more dirt and more pet hair out of the carpet than the other one.  Not by a little bit, but by a huge amount.  I vacuumed the house before sending the other vacuum back.  Then immediately vacuumed the house again: it looked as though I never vacuumed it with the other vacuum; the lint bucket was full.
I hope this lasts 15 more years, because I never want to use another vacuum.
Oh, I did have to go out and buy a bristle brush attachment.

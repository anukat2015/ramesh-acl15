Title: Very nice MP3 Player
Content:
*UPDATE*
I've seen many people with the bad FM Radio reception issue.
Try using the earbuds as an antenna and that should solve the issue.
*UPDATE* 6/21/2005
I've own the zen micro for 1 month now, and no problems.
Im very pleased with this MP3 player.
*UPDATE* 6/24/2005
I read on another site that the Smart Volume reduces battery life by 50%. So make sure to turn off this option if you want extended battery life.
I just got the Zen Micro on 20th May 2005 and its working flawless.
PROS
- 5 GB is enough for me, also 1 GB plus the iPod mini.
- It has awesome colors to choose from.
- FM Radio and Recorder. I really like to listen to FM Radio.
- FM Radio signal is really good here. Performance in other areas may vary.
- Vertical Touch Pad gets a moment to get used to it, but its incredible.
- Extremely easy instructions and buttons.
- The Blue light is just awesome!
- LCD screen is easy to read.
- Its really tiny, really different from pictures.
- You can customize many features!
- Microphone included. (A really nice touch.)
- Awesome quality sound.
- The battery recharges when its connected via USB.
- Comes with some useful accesories, like the USB cable, AC adapter and the hard case.
- You can create playlists on the fly! You can delete tracks or playlists as well.
- User replaceable battery.
- Nice Look
CONS
- Earbuds have really good sound quality, but theyre too big(at least for me)
- Battery isnt 12 hours. With a full charge, mine lasted only like 6 hours, but I can deal with it.
- Seems sort of fragile, so handle it with care.
- It doesn't have iron parts.
- The belt clip is from really bad quality, although I cant find a really good use for it.
I think that this isn't the player for you if you have a crappy computer.(not to be offensive, but I havent had any trouble with the PC recognizing my device lately, and this computer rocks! :-P)
I love this mp3 player, and so far I havent had any problems, and I hope not to have them

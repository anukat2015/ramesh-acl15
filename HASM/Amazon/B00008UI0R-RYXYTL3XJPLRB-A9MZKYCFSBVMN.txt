Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
This is an awesome vacuum!  I was thinking of getting the electrolux but went with this for budget friendly and it is great, it comes with a vacuum nozzle which helps for that added cleaning for placees such as stairs or the car.  It comes with a few different utinsils that attach to the end of the hose. The vacuum is push button with 3 suction speeds with a display on the canister to show you your speed and if the canister needs to be emptied, you can switch the power nozle on or off for carpet or flooring, I love this vacuum it sucks so much out of the carpet it makes me wonder where all this dirt comes from, I really recommend this item! :)

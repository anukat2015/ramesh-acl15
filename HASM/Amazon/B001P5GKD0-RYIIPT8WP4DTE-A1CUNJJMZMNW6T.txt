Title: high performance; sub-standard housing
Content:
Yup, the MSI GT627-218US definitely has top-of-the-line display, memory, and video card.  But, I immediately noticed a problem with the Disc drive (difficult to close) and the keyboard which is really flimsy.  The keyboard kind-a "floats", and feels very weak - not solid in feel.  
From past experience with other non-brand name laptops (in which construction components fell apart after a few months), I was dissappointed that this machine doesn't feel or appear more "solid" in construction.  I will likely now purchase a Dell or HP, and compare which ones seem better constructed, then return the other machine.

Title: Its loud, but it works.
Content:
I got this for my spacious office which is ALWAYS cold.  Its loud, even at the low fan setting.  However, I also ordered a Coby ipod clock radio which seems to help me not be distracted by the noise.  I do kind of wish I'd seen the sale at Target 2 Holmes heaters for the price of one for $24...but I didn't and honestly I am warmer - so I don't feel the need to return it.
I bet it would be perfect for your garage watching football with your buddies.  ;]

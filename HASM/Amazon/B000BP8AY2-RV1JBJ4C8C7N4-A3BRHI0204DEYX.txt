Title: It's A No-Brainer.  For $29.99, BUY IT!
Content:
I bought my first Sandisk m200 series mp3 player three summers ago for $179.  It was the m260 4 gig player, which I packed with just about every classic rock and pop song from 1940 to now, and attached to my bicycle handlebars.  Today, I'm still using the same player and it works like a charm.
Since then, I purchased two additional m200 series Sandisk players - a 1gb and a 2gb.  I use them as a music source for our town street fair and my neighborhood's block party, among many other things.  I guess I'm hooked on this neat little player.
Two major advantages, for me, over the iPod are:
1.  They run on basic AAA batteries for hours and hours (I just ran one at a 12-hour party last week and still had about a quarter of a charge at the end)
2.  Copying files into these units is as simple as dragging and dropping onto a USB stick or external hard drive.
Yeah, iPods are slick and sexy, but I wouldn't trade any of my m200 series players for ANY of the available iPod models.  And cheez....what's this with the $29.99 price?  Even if this unit is used or refurbished, I would scoop it up right away!

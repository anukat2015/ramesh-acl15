Title: Acer Aspire 1410
Content:
I have had this laptop for about 30 days, and it is very good.  All the previous reviews cover pretty much all the details:
- Small size
- Bright LED display
- Great keyboard
- HDMI port
The lack of an internal optical drive was not an issue for me.  I have plenty of USB DVD burners.
The laptop looks fantastic on my 40" TV through the HDMI connection.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.

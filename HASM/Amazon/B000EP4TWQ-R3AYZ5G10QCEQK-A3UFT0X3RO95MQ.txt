Title: Enjoying the music
Content:
I had a great experience ordering my new Apple 4 GB Nano Ipod. I found it was about $30 less expensive than getting it from the Apple site or from a store near me. I had it within a week (worth it for the savings)and was able to use my Amazon credit card savings certificate.

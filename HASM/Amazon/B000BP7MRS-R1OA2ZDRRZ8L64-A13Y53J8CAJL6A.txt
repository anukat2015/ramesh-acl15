Title: It's Just a Great Coffee Maker
Content:
I replaced a new Mr Coffee - coffee maker that was simply miserable to use with this one.  I'll go through why I like it in this review.  If you don't want to read the full review - just know that it's a great coffee maker.
My one con:
The water level indicator on the side of the coffee maker tells how many cups of coffee you will get in the pot not how much water you poured into the coffee maker.  You always loose some water that gets trapped by the coffee grounds, some evaporates, etc.  It's just odd to me to pour 8 cups of coffee in the coffee maker and have it read 7.5 cups - which is exactly how much coffee winds up in the pot.
The pros:
It makes a great, hot and fast cup of coffee.  My wife said the thing must be turbocharged.
It has a Brita water filter which really helps remove the nasty taste in city water.  We use Brita water pitchers too.
I read some reviews that talked about the pot dripping when poured or steaming up or something.  After using this coffee maker for a month or so, everything works just fine and just exactly the way you would expect it to.
It has some neat features - clock, programmable brew time, programmable time for the hot plate to stay hot before turning off.
It has the V shaped basket which I believe makes a better tasting cup of coffee.
What can I say?  I bought it here on Amazon.  I'm happy with it.  I would buy it again.

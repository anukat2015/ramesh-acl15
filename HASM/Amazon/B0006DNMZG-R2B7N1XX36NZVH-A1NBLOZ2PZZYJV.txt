Title: Excellent for small, enclosed
Content:
Pros:
Small footprint
Heating element well hidden inside the machine
Redundant safety features
Relatively quiet
Competitively priced
Cons:
Thermostat is not as accurate as I like
Not good for "spot" heating, like warming up just the rocking chair area when watching TV.
This heater suits best for heating up small, enclosed spaces (about 14x14sq.ft.).  I use it in my bedroom and the result is great.  
The air outlet velocity is low and non vectorized by design.  It relies on low velocity, de-facto free, convection as a prime source of heat transfer.  This mode of heating carries an advantage for not drying skin (Example, a typical hot-air blowing heater  acts like a hair dryer!), and heat very evenly within a small area.  Thus make this a bad choice for "spot" heating.  
Advice the last person who gave this machine a bad rating.  You are like complaining about a Toyota Corolla not able to reach 200mph.  Please spend some money to insulate the place and buy a bigger heater, or two for your application.
The unit was solidly built, has overheat and tip-over sensor, and the heating element was located in a remote location and it's impossible to touch.  Therefore, it scores really high on safety.  However, please use common sense when using this unit (keep the unit away from small children, moisture, water, drapery...)
The unit uses a "Mechanical" thermostat and it does not control the room's temperature very well.  It would be better for Honeywell to change it to a digital thermostat.
Conclusion: Use it for what it's best for (small, enclosed space or 14x14 sq.ft.), and you will not be dissappointed.

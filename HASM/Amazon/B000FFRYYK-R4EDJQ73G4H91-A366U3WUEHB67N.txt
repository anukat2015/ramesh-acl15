Title: Please reconsider...
Content:
I always purchase Bunn coffee makers. However, I am extremely disappointed with this Thermofresh model. There are 2 primary problems with this model... problems that eliminate any advantage for buying it. 
1) The coffee temperature at brew time is not as high as it should be, therefore creating "warm" coffee that is supposed to stay hot in the thermofresh carafe. Rather pitiful. 
2) The carafe leaks unbelievably. No joke, if you don't pour over the sink you will be spending time cleaning up. I promise. ...and I hate seeing coffee poured into the sink. 
Please think twice before you waste your money on this high-priced junk. 
If you want a Bunn, and I usually recommend them, buy a different model.

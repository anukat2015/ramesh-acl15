Title: Very pleased
Content:
So far I am very happy with this coffee maker.  The pink is not too bright & it makes nice hot coffee.  The carafe seems pretty sturdy too.  I had a pink cooks brand coffeepot that was so bad I threw it out.  I read all the reviews on this model in all colors & almost everyone Likes this model.  I am hoping it will last for a long time as it looks great in my kitchen.  The 3 year warranty is nice too.

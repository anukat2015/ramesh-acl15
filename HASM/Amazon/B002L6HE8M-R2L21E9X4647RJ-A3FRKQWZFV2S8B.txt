Title: IPod really easy to use..
Content:
IPOD Nano is a terriffic product. Despite the limited instructions included with this product,any person (especially the techno illiterate as myself)can use this product easily.There is plenty of GB for lots of music,movies,TV episodes etc.It includes a video camera,a radio,a shuffle feature that is great to use for listening to your I Tunes selections in no particular order if you choose. The screen is bright and easy to see.The product includes earphones and a connection plug to your computer for downloading  and charging your IPod.The sound is great,not tinny at all. There was no problems with delivery as I received it a few days ahead of the delivery date.

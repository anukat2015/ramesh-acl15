Title: #1 choice for any one
Content:
I have been using the canon T1I for about 3 months now. This camera is really nice, i love how even though i didnt know a lot about slr at first this camera has a auto mode. I think this is a great piece to learn on or even for more experts to use. I mean for one the price is right, the camera is perfect, and it has every feature you can think of. 
I also have the 18-55mm standard included lens, the Canon EF Telephoto lens - 85 mm - F/1.8 - Canon EF, and the Canon 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens.

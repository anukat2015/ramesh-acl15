Title: Nice camera but...
Content:
I'm not going to go over the technical aspects of this camera. There are lots of other places that do that. Anyhow, I shoot professionally on the side, and this camera does just about everything well, except for sports photography. The autofocus and noise level is not nearly as good as its chief competitor. The high speed crop (8fps) reduces the quality of the image, and I'm not talking about megapixels. By the way, all you Nikon shooters (including myself) waiting for the D3H with 10 megapixel, 10 fps, and a 3-inch LCD screen, the wait is over... it's called the Canon EOS-1D Mark III. Because of the type of assignments I cover, I'm going to try out the new Canon EOS-1D Mark III when it releases this summer. I'll continue to shoot with the D2Xs for non-sporting events because it's still a very capable camera and the fact that I've already invested a lot of money on Nikon lenses.
8/23/07 - No! I probably made the jump over to Canon a little too soon now that the D3 is coming out in November.

Title: Exceptionally effective supplementary heat
Content:
We purchased two of these as a way of minimizing use of central heating in our big old house and we've been delighted with them.  The oil holds heat for a very long time once it gets hot, and we've been able to reduce the thermostat setting by just placing these in the rooms we're using at the time.  To our surprise there was a smaller impact on the electric bill than we expected, but a big drop in our oil use.  Just be sure to follow the instructions to run them full on for a few hours outside to burn off the coating they put on them at the factory.

Title: Spiffy Little Heater
Content:
This heater is an excellent choice for a small space.  Because it has a fan, it would not be suitable for a TV area.  And because it's not sold by Amazon, you'll have to pay shipping (but even with that, the heater is a bargain).  Compared to an earlier Honeywell unit of the same size that we had, Pelonis does everything right (whereas Honeywell did everything wrong).  The controls are on top (handy), the knobs are easy to dial, and the light goes out when you turn off the fan (the Honeywell's light  stayed on if the unit was plugged in (huh?). Note:  In the picture, the heater appears to be cream colored; it is actually white.

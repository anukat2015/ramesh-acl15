Title: Dandy Digital SLR
Content:
This is by far the best digital SLR in this price range.  Very easy to use, and the pix are spectacular. That I can use all the lenses and accessories from my old Canon 35mm SLR is a big plus.  I like being able to use it in the fully automatic mode, or use it manually at the turn of a dial.  The optical viewfinder is excellent.  You can't go wrong with the Rebel XTi. I should have bought it sooner!

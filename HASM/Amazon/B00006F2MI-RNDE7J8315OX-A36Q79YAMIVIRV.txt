Title: Just a Plain-o Good Cup of Coffee
Content:
Let me start just by saying that, for the money, this unit makes a great cup of coffee.  I would like to give my opinion on some of the other negatives aspects which other people have given this unit in their reviews.  Does the grinding system make noise?  Yes, but it is not what I consider loud, and I have yet to find a coffee grinder which is completely silent!  Is the unit made of plastic with an outer stainless steel sheel, or faceplate?  Yes, but with the price of metal these days (I work in that industry), this unit would be unaffordable to the average buyer if Cuisinart made it all metal.  It is a sturdy unit with good looks!  Does the steam stay in the unit and make cleaning difficult?  Yes, but if Cuisinart made the steam escape, consumers would complain that the steam condenses on their cabinets.  It is not difficult to clean.  You pull all the parts (4 total) out and run them under hot water and then wipe down the inside with a paper towel.  Is the unit too tall to fit under cabinets when opened?  Yes, but you only have the unit open to get it ready to brew or clean out.  Once it's running or for storage, it fits perfectly on the counter.  Finally, does the carafe pour slowly?  Yes, but I'll take that negative since the coffee stays hot and doesn't overcook sitting on a standard hot pad.  I will end with saying that this compact, good-looking grind and brew until is very well worth the money.  It filters your water, grinds fresh beans and keeps your coffee hot for hours after brewing.  The unit can be programed and has a nice safety feature which will not start the brewing process unless all the parts are properly assembled.  Here's to Cuisinart...cheers!

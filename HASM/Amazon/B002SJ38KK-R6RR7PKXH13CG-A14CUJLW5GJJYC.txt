Title: GREAT PURCHASE
Content:
Once again Acer and Amazon website provides a great product, love the size of the screen and the keypad.  And it has the full version of Windows 7, not just the starter win 7 so makes for a great little netbook for all your needs.  The website thru Amazon in which I ordered it was terrific, speedy delivery and would order from them again...all in all a great product, so if your needing a netbook that is between a netbook size and a reg. laptop, this is the one.....don't hesitate to purchase, you won't be disappointed.

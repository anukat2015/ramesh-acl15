Title: Thermostat problem
Content:
Same experience as the other reviews. The heat is great when it is on but after the first 2 minutes it shuts off for about 1 minute and back on for about 15 seconds. It keeps repeating this pattern. Very disappointing for a Honeywell product. Kaz Incorporated bought this division of Honeywell in 2002. Appears to have impacted Honeywell quality. I wanted to give no stars but the review rating will not permit this.

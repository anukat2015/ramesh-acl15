Title: Tried the rest, got the best.
Content:
I bought this vacuum after reading all the great reviews, and I just got my order in today, put it together (no screwdriver needed, thank you very much) and tried it out.  I was amazed at how well this vacuum worked. It made my old carpet look new again! This vacuum has such power and it's lightweight and quiet, compared to the many vacuums I have gone through over the years, this one is surely a keeper. Most people complained, however, about emptying the container after each use, but I would rather not have all that crud it picks up just lying in the canister.  I don't mind cleaning it after vacuuming four bedrooms, a hallway, and stairs. I most definately reccomend this vacuum.

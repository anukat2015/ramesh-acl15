Title: Works Great, but no control of music
Content:
This product works well and easy to use.  The problem I encountered is when you DL your music to it, it will sort your music into where it thinks it should be.  It will put your music into several genres, dividing a single album into many parts.  Then when you want listen to your music, it is mixed up.

Title: Good purchase
Content:
Not to disrespect the other reviewers here - I understand that some products work well in some situations and not in others.
For my own experience, this has been a great purchase, none of the problems others have reported.  I've had it for 3 years now (my building is a bit slow to switch from hot/cold for central air) and it's been great, no leaking, no electrical problems, just very reliable, cold air.  In fact I'm on here right now buying a 2nd one.

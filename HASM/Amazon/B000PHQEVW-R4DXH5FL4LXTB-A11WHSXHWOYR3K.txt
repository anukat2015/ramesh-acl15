Title: Great Value
Content:
We have four of these little stones in our family, mainly for use while exercising, and they are incredible.  For about $20 you would expect a cheap product.  But they have good sound, an ok battery life (~8 hours total use, lose very little charge when off, and they charge quite fast), decent sized memory, very small size, VERY light (you really don't even need an armband, just shove it in your shirt, the headphones are almost heavier than the stone itself), and virtually indestructible!
We had one accidentally go through the clothes washer (check your pockets) and then drier and it still worked!  About a month later, it took another whirl through the washing machine.  This time it looked like it had had it, so we bought another inexpensive brand player to replace it. 
After a few weeks the new player fell apart.  Decided to check the now very clean stone to see if the weeks of drying had done anything, and...worked great and is still going strong months later.

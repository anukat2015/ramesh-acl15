Title: good deal
Content:
I picked the Creative Zen as it was one of the ones recommended for listening to audiobooks, especially from our library system. It does bookmarking which not all players do. I did put a number of my CDs on it, though I tend to prefer actually listening on a sterro system. At any rate, it is a nice player though not all of the controls are obvious to me. For me, it is almost too small but then I am an old guy. Ironic, as this is to get around difficulty in reading books. I have enjoyed the radio feature though I would like to delete unused presets and still haven't figured that and a few other things out. But for the money, this is a very impressive buy and I am happy with it.

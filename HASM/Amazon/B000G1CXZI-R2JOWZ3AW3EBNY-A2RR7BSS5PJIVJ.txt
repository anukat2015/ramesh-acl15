Title: great little heater
Content:
i've tried 3 different heaters for my home and this is definitely the best!.....one room is 23' by 18' with high ceilings ~~~ after running a day the room was warmed up greatly (just remember to close all doors and blinds in the room to contain heat).....it was too hot running on the high setting for another room that was 14' by 17'....i highly recommend this product!

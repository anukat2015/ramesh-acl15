This is the best vacuum I have owned, it's lightweight, easy to operate and has all the attachments that are needed on hand. I was even able to assemble it out of the box without reading instructions! I have mostly carpeting throughout my house and the carpet attachment easily vacuums underneath sofas and buffets. It's also terrific on my vinyl floors and the retractable cord makes it easy to put away. Great job Electrolux!

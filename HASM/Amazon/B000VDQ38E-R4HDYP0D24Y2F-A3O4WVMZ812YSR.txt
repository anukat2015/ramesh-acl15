Title: Piece of Crap
Content:
It worked at first, but would become clogged so easily. It's a mess to empty too. After a few months it just stopped working. I lost a job and got a new one with less pay and can't afford a new vacuum now! Today I tried vacuuming up all the pet hair in my apartment and NO SUCTION. What a horrible product. And no..it's not clogged.

Title: great little pot
Content:
I purchased this coffeemaker after a morning of broken glass carafe.  I have never had a pot this small and bought it anticipating my eventual purchase of my "dream" Capresso model.  I am very satisfied.  The coffee is hot! Brews in about 8 minutes, but I am having difficulty with the sneak a cup feature- it has yet to work right. Price is terrific for a cup of coffee that doesn't disappoint.

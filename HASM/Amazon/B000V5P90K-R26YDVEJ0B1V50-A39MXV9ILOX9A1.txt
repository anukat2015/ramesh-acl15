Title: Great DSLR!!! Canon does it again!
Content:
Anyone looking for a decently priced semi-pro digital single lense reflex camera, look no more. It's fast ( 6.5 fps ), self cleaning and just downright feels more expensive than it is. I also have a 20D, which is a great camera, but wanted to have a spare because of the number of lenses I now possess (10-22mm, 17-70mm and 70-300mm). Yes, the 50D is coming out now, but unless you are blowing up your pix extremely large, there is no need for anything more than this one. I think the Nikon product is lovely, but not worth the extra $$$ for both body and lenses, when you see the quality of your photos from this SLR.

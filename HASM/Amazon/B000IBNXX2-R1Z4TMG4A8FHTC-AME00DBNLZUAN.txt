Title: Great player, TERRIBLE firmware and support
Content:
Got this a year and a half ago. Have Windows XP. Took several hours to get it to work on the computer. Kept showing up as "not connected" even though it was. Support was mediocre. Finally got it working. Then it suddenly stopped - was "not recognized" by Creative's own firmware, Creative Media Source Organizer and Zen Media Explorer. Web FAQ's and troubleshooting were extremely technical. I tried everything and learned a lot about my computer and Creative, but nothing worked. Some of the topics I clicked on even came back as "error" and I couldn't even get info for those topics.  Email support won't help because it's more than a year. I can pay $12.99 for 30 minutes of support by phone if I wish. I'll have to, but feel angry and stuck. Tried rating their support online and it would not let me - each time I tried to submit it, I got a new window that said "error"! Not even the Forums have been helpful unless you are an expert computer user. I'm intermediate and have spent several more hours this week trying to make it work. I'll never buy a Creative product again, despite the fact that the player itself works great, sounds great, looks great, etc. What good is it if I can't download music, etc.?

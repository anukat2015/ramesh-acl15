Title: The best coffee brewing system in the world!
Content:
I owned the B60 Keurig single cup brewer for about a year until I realized that I needed one at work!  I upgraded to the B-70 and can honestly say, with unabashed enthusiasm that the Keurig systems are simply the best!!  I have talked many of my colleagues into buying one of the units - specifically the B-70.  There are some nice options associated with this model including the four brew sizes, temperature setting, timer, and let's not forget the cool light-up water reservoir!

Title: Perfect heater for me
Content:
I am very pleased with this heater.  I use it to heat ME, while using my computer in the basement.  It does a wonderful job.  It also oscillates if needed, it can be used as a fan without heat in the summertime, it has a very convenient remote control, it looks good, it's reasonable.  I'm very happy with it.  I have no idea how it would work in a larger room, but if you want a nice heater for yourself, you can't go wrong with this one, in my opinion.

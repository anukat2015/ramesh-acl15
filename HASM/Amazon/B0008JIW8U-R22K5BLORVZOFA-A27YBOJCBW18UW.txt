Title: Great Little Coffee Maker
Content:
I had my eyes on the much more expensive Zojirushi 5-cup maker and therefore was skeptical when my wife bought this coffee maker. But this 4-cup maker from Mr. Coffee has won me over. It works flawlessly and brews just the right amount for my needs - 24oz. I measured the temperature of the coffee - 175F, which is spot on according to coffee brewing afficianados. The carafe pours without a drip or dribble. I haven't used the programming feature because I don't need to have my coffee waiting for me when I get up in the morning. I also put my coffee in a thermos right after brewing, so I needn't concern myself with the automatic off. My wife, who does not drink coffee and considers coffee makers to clutter the kitchen counter, does not mind me keeping this one out as it has a very small footprint. If you are looking for an excellent, affordable and flawlessly working small coffee maker, check this one out.

Title: okay so far, but where on earth do you get water filters?
Content:
Looks great,coffee tastes great, but absolutely not a word in the manual or on the box about where to get replacement water filters.  Odd, isn't it?  And not a peep on the DeLonghi web site.  You'd think they'd see the obvious moneymaking opportunity here.
Help!!!!

Title: The Best Product for Your Money
Content:
If you've never had a laptop before, this laptop has everything you need to get started. Windows loads in 3 to 5 seconds. The touch pad is very sensitive, so there's no need for a mouse. Every function of a PC keyboard is here in the key pad of this laptop. You can close the lid and save what you're working on when the lap top goes to sleep or shuts off. You can also have it do nothing when you close the lid. Fully discharging the battery by using your laptop unplugged will get you more time when it is fully charged again. I am currently up to 3 hours and maybe 15 minutes or more. Leave your power settings on "Power Saver" and the charge will last longer without seriously affecting performance. I have yet to see a difference other than the time it takes to fully discharge. If you want a laptop, Toshiba Satellite is the one to buy. It's cheaper than Wal-Mart.

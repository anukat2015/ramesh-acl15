Title: MY FAVORITE VACUUM CLEANER!!!
Content:
The Electrolux 69AA Oxygen Canister Vacuum couldn't be better.  It is easy to carry with its swinging handle and also pulls easily.  The cord pulls out easily and goes in smoothly after use.  All of the attachments are well thought out.  The power cleaner does a great job on the rugs, and the long extra flat floor cleaner fits well under quite low chests.  The small square hand brush cleans places I could never reach with a round one.  The suction is terrific and really gets the dog hair off of the sofa (Casey is not supposed to be there) using the little flat head.
All in all our house has never been cleaner.

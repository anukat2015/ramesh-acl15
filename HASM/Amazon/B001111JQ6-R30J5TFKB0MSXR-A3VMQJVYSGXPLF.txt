Title: Terrible Coffee Maker - coffee not hot
Content:
We bought this as a replacement coffee maker after our other Cuisinart died after a year. We call this the 'bad feng shui' coffee maker because it has a beep on it that is SO LOUD it feels like it is piercing our eardrums every time it goes off. Coffee tastes so-so and is never that warm. The thermal carafe is not thermal at all. Ours is brand new but we will be replacing it too.

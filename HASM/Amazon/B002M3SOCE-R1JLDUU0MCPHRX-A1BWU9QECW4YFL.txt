Title: iPod Touch
Content:
I resisted buying an iPod Touch until the newest version came out. I'm glad I waited because this one has all the features, storage capacity, and price that I could want. But by waiting I also missed out on a couple of years of fun with this cool little gadget. I'd done other iPod models and always was impressed with them. The Touch is a whole new way to use an iPod. I use it more for movies and apps than I do music, but the music is the easiest to access of any iPod I've used, as well. 
Now I have to buy two more of them for my adult kids for Christmas. They're so enthralled with mine that they keep dropping hints about getting one for themselves. It'll kind of put the fun back into Christmas to do this and I'll know that they're getting a good quality item that they can use for years to come.

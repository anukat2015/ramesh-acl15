Title: Cozy & Warm/Attractive Heater
Content:
I love the look of this heater.  Everyone comments that it looks like a small piece of furniture, like an end table.  The oak cabinet is easily cleaned just like any other wood furniture.
As for comfort, let me say I love being toasty warm and this unit does the job.  It will heat up to one thousand square feet.  It will not work well if you have cathedral ceilings, nor will any other heater.  The castors make it easy to move from room to room if you want.
We bought this heater on the recommendation of several friends who have owned this heater for several years and all are happy with it and have had no problems. At this time we have only one of these heaters, but are considering buying a second one this winter to place in another area of our home. 
Another nice feature of this heater is that it contains four 375 Watt infra-red lamps that can be replaced by the consumer.  Other heaters have bulbs that are hard-wired making it necessary to have them replaced by the maker.
This unit has a simple thermostat, not the digital display type with many selections.  My husband loves this feature because we already have too many appliaces and electronics with confusing digital displays.   
Highly recommended!

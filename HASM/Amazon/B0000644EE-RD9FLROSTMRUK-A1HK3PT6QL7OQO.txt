Title: Disapointed
Content:
We loved this pot when we bought it.  The design, the taste and temperature of the coffee;  but like everyone else our joy was short lived.  The cheap plastic top snapped off after 3 months. I have not contacted the company, but I will be doing so shortly. I wish I had read these reviews before I went shopping.

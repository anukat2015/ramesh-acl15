Title: Great for a small room
Content:
I have a bathroom in the basement and during the winter the temperature in the basement is usually around 60 degrees.  That is a little chilly for taking a shower.
This little heater is just perfect for heating up a small room.  I go downstairs in the morning and turn it on and it heats up quick.  This is a small unit so if you have a large bathroom you will need the next size up.
Installation was easy.  I did have one question on the wiring which I e-mailed to their support and received an answer that same day.

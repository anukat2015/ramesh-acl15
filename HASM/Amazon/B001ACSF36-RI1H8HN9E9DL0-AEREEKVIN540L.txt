Title: Whynter SNO 13,000-BTU Portable Air Conditioner
Content:
Pros: This air conditioner does have a lot of power and will cool a large area.
Cons: Produces a large amount of water. The manual does not explain how to empty the water collection tank.
The unit will stop dead in its tracks once it fills with water. I called Whynter to ask for directions, but they were not very helpful. 
They suggested buying a drain hose which I tried, but it did not work. I ended up elevating the unit tilted just slightly so that the
water would drain out of the back into a pan on the floor. This works, but the pan has to be emptied frequently which is a hassle. In 
hind-sight, I would probably buy a different brand/model.

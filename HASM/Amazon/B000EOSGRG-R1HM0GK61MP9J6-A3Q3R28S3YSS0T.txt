Title: Works great but it is smelly
Content:
When I read the first review on this vacuum about it being smelly, I thought maybe not all of them would have the same issue.  Since it was the strongest wet/dry cordless hand vacuum that I could find, I decided to order it anyway. It's a lot more powerful than our old 7.2 volt wet/dry Dustbuster. But, the smell that it gives off when in use is pretty strong. So, if you don't really need the wet pick-up feature too much (I don't pick up wet messes with the vacuum as often as I thought I would), I would recommend the Black & Decker CHV1400 14.4-Volt Cyclonic DustBuster. It's gotten pretty good reviews and our Black & Decker held up well over the years.

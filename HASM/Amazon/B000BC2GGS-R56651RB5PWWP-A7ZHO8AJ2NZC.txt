Title: Silent heater
Content:
I bought this heater because it was silent and had a thermostat. I was a little worried about the thermostat part of it because I have another Honeywell heater (Honeywell HZ-338 Sure-Set Ceramic Heater with Oscillation) that uses the same kind of controls and it doesn't work right at all. In fact I bought this heater to replace the other one because it was loud and would turn off and on every two minutes all night long. This new one works well and the thermostat seems to be much better at keeping the room a constant temperature. We did worry a little about the very hot grill, because we're using it in our two year old's room. But he's smart enough now to know not to touch hot things and it's mainly on when he's in bed. I would like it if I could have the unit off of the floor, but that's a minor thing. I would buy one of these again if I needed another quiet heater.

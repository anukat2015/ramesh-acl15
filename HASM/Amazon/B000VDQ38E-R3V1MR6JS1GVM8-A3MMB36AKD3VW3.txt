Title: Died after 2 uses.
Content:
I read all the reviews about this vacuum, and was pretty pleased with it when I first got it home.  It definitely picked up tons of dirt and hair that my old vacuum was leaving behind. I did notice that it made a loud, high pitched noise when I used it on bare floors, but a call to the service center informed us to raise the brush higher.  We had to raise the setting to "high pile" carpet to make it stop making the noise on our bare floor, which I thought was odd, then why does it have the "bare floor" option?
I was still ok with it until today when I went to turn it on and...nothing.  We have used this vacuum twice and it is completely dead.  Now I have to pack it up and take it to a repair center where it will take who knows how long to get a part in from Mexico.  I am told the repair will be covered under warranty, but at this point, I am not holding much enthusiasm for this vacuum and I would not buy it again.

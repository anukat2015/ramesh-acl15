Title: Excellent heating for its size
Content:
Great product. For its size the Holmes HFH105 heats a small single room very well. It may be a bit noisy but that should not refrain you from buying the product. Its not very expensive but you will see a definite increase in your electricity bill but a bargain in terms of overall energy cost savings.

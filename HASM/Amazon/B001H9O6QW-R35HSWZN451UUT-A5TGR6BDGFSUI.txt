Title: Bad Head Phone Connector
Content:
I returned it right away after I opened the package. The head phone connector wasn't working properly. If I plug all the way into the connector, I can't hear anything. I have to pull out a little bit to hear the sound. I've never seen any MP3 player with the same issue.

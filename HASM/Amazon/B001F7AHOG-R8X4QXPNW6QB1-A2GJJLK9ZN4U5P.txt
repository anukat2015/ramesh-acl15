Title: Disappointing quality/sound
Content:
I love the iPod but this has been a huge disappointment. The hard drive is really noisy when it changes songs, and it did not remember where it was paused in a couple of audiobooks.  I assumed this was a defective one and got a new one.  Amazon customer service is impeccable!  
The second iPod has a less noisy hard drive, but it reset itself for no reason in the middle of a song and then when I tried to re-sync it would not connect to iTunes. Once it finally connected, iTunes says that there is no music on the iPod and that it cannot be synched/recognized. This was after 1 day of use where it was not dropped or mistreated and never left the house.  My 5th generation iPod, 3rd generation and shuffle synchronized just fine, so it's not iTunes or my Mac.  
Also, I would say the music quality is not as good as the 5th generation with video.  It lacks depth on the new Classic.  The size of the device and the hard drive capacity is fantastic and I really like the ability to use the genius function.  I even like the slightly odd split screen.  I will probably try again with another one, but this is really disappointing.  My first bad experience with many years of Apple products.

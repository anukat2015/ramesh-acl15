Title: dangerous
Content:
I love the color.  that is why I bought it.  I had it for 2 months.  There is just a tiny plastic piece  which  hooks over the top of the glass caraf from the handle.  no more than 1/2 inch square.  this is all that holds the glass carafe onto the top of the pot.  It broke off.  very dangerous with a whole pot of hot coffee.  The bottom of the handle stayed attached but is VERY loose with out the top being attached also..

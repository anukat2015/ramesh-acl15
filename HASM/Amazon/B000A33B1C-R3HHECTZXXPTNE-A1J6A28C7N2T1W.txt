Title: Excellent -- warm and silent
Content:
I've been using the Delonghi since I got it in 2008 most every day through the winter and it's been just excellent. I use it in my home office to avoid heating the whole house when I work from home, which is about 4 days a week. It did smell some for the first month or so I guess, but then it went away. It's silent and warms the room just great.

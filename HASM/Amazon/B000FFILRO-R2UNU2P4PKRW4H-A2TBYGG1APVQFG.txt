Title: Love it - But!
Content:
I purchased this coffee pot several months ago.  It makes great coffee, but when I make 10 cups, it overflows and there is coffee all over my counter.  I usually make 6 cups daily and it is great, but when I have company and make more - well I am not happy.  Like I said I do use it daily and have no problem.  Fastest coffee maker ever - HOT HOT HOT!  Just don't know why when you make a full pot it overflows.

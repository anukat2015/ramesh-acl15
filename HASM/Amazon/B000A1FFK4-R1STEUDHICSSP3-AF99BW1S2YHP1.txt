Title: Crap
Content:
Made a single pot of coffee and water started leaking out of the cold water reservoir through the base of the machine and all over the counter.
Nothing obvious; no cracks, holes or any other visible leak points -- but the water just poured through the machine and out the bottom.
Unfortunately, I had already discarded the box -- so no returns.

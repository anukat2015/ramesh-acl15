Title: It is a cooling fan not an AC
Content:
This blows moist air on to your skin so it draws the heat away. But it does not cool the room. The only way to make the temperature in a room cooler than the outside air temperature is to use an Air Conditioner. But you don't need an air conditioner to stay cool. Moving air draws away heat, just like the way cooling fans cool computer CPUs. This air cooler just adds moisture to the equation so it cools your skin better than an electric fan that just blows dry air. So make sure that if you buy this that it comes in direct contact with your skin, or else this will not be effective.

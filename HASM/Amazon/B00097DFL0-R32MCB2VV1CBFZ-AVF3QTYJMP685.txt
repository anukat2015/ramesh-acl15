Title: Getting worse
Content:
I bought this product in the summer of 07.  I live in a room over the garage that gets the brunt of the sun and therefor reaches 78-80 degrees even with the AC on.  At first the unit after running for a couple hours would drop the temp to 72 on a summer day but no lower.  The first spring/summer I did not have to change the water at all.  The next spring/summer it could only drop the temp down to 73-74 and I had to change the water 5-6 times.  Now only less than 3 years later we are in the midst of our first 80 degree week.  The unit is only dropping the temp to 75 and I've had to change the water twice in two days.
Please read everyone's review about how hard it is to change the water.  I can confirm every complaint.
If I had to do it over I would have gone another route towards cooling my room.

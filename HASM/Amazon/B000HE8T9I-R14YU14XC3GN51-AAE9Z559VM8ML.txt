Title: Do Not Buy - All Negative Reviews Are True
Content:
My wife and I bought this vacuum and have regretted it ever since.  The belt for the brush constantly breaks.  We have replaced the belt three times in the last six months.  Just recently the belt broke and I noticed that the plastic cover at the bottom of the vacuum has worn out, due to the beater head rubbing and melting the plastic.  I called customer support and they told me that it would cost $29.95 for a replacement part, since it was not covered under the warranty.  After several attempts to explain the problems my wife and I have had, they still wanted to charge me for the part.  I finally told them that the vacuum was a lemon and I was going to toss it in the trash if it was going to cost me $30 every six months to fix it.  The customer rep finally said he would ship the part for free.  I am still tempted to toss it in the trash, but then we would be out $200 and have no way to clean the carpets.  All the negative reviews are true.  I whish I would have read them before buying this awful machine.

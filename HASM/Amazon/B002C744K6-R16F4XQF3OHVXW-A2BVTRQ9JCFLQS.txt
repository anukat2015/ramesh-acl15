Title: Mac is awesome.
Content:
I have been using Windows for 13 years now and I have been happy for a while. I built many Windows computers and even my current one (quad core, 8gb Ram) and used Windows Vista Premium 64x. Windows is a very good operating system, it is functional (despite what some say, Vista worked great after SP1) but it uses its resources terribly. 
With that said, this laptop is amazing. The screen is larger and so beautiful (using LEDs makes it very efficient as well). The backlite keyboard and the laptop in general oozes sexyness. But some may comment on the hardware included with it (small HDD, 4gb ran, nvidia 9400m) and they can get a really kick-ass windows computer for the same if not less more. Though if you think performance will be better, it won't. Mac OSX 10.6 uses the hardware provided and runs QUICKER than my Windows PC mentioned above. The laptop itself is thin and lite but is made of aluminum so it is durable. Speakers are great for a laptop and the battery life is 7 hours+ with some dimming. Only problem I have is i cannot connect my networked printer, but I am working on that.
Mac OSX 10.6 is a very stable, quick, sleek, fun operating system. The laptop comes with all you need to get started, just make sure you run the updating software ect. I thought I was going to have a hell of a time adapting to it, but I did so in less than two days. If your looking at this for a laptop GET IT. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

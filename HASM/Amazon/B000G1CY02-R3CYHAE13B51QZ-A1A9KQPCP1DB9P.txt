Title: Works well but sucks power and .....
Content:
The Delonghi HHP 1500 radiator works well but it sucks power. Can use up to 1500 watts!. Also what they don't tell you in the ads is that you have to plug it in to its OWN outlet/circuit and can't use an extension cord of power strip. It kind of makes it so you have to reallt plan where to put it.

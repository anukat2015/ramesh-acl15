Title: Excellent single bup coffee brewer
Content:
I'm one of those customers who had problems with the last model. In fact I returned mine twice for replacement and was sent this GT300 as the most recent replacement. Brewing a cup of coffee this morning I realized I needed to commend Black and Decker on the GT300. It has lasted me around 6 months now and I use it almost daily. On cold days like today, I use it six or more times a day. Sometimes I just use it to make hot water for some instant oatmeal or hot tea. 
1) It's durable - around 200 servings so far for me
2) It's versatile - it comes with 3 pod holders - single, double and specialty (cappuccino) or can simple heat water
3) It's easy to clean - the parts that get dirty most often come apart and reassemble easily
4) Pods are plentiful - works with all coffee and tea pods I've seen. You can even custom make your own pods with a "kit".
My only criticisms:
1) The "creamy" setting doesn't seem any different than the 7 ounce setting. 
2) Some cappuccino pods don't froth (Douwe Egbert), which may be more of a pod issue than a coffee maker issue.
3) The water reservoir is adequate for a cup a day. If you brew more than that you'll be filling it once a day or more. I can get about 3 cups per fill. This isn't a deal-breaker for me but a larger reservoir would be more convenient.
Overall if this GT300 lasts me another 6 months and dies, I would definitely still buy this model again.

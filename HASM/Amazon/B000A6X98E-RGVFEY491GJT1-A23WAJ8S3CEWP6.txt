Title: Good little heater but noisy
Content:
My title pretty much says it all. It takes a while to warm up and start putting out heat, but does well eventually.  Mine is three years old and I use it under my desk at work.  The fan is very noisy for a small heater, and gets noisier as it get more wear. If shut off when hot, the fan won't restart for several minutes.  By the growling sounds it makes, I expect the fan will sieze up entirely soon. The temp control is very coarse, almost useless. The phony orange "glow" spots on the grill looks silly too. No way I'd pay over $30 for one.

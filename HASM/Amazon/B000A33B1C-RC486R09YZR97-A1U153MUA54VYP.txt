Title: Delonghi TRD0715T Oil-Filled Radiator
Content:
I purchased this heater from the local Lowes after reading all the reviews on this particular product, and reviews on other heaters.
Pros:  Quiet (only pings once in a while heating up or cooling down); radiates lots of heat after initial warm up; does not burn fingers at low heat setting; Safe to leave on 24 seven.
Cons:  Cord needs to be more heavy duty and needs to be longer - since the heater cannot be placed next to a wall, and the fact that some apartments or houses do not have convenient outlets; it would be a lot better if it had a digital thermostat instead of just an adjustable thermostat; timer is a little daunting in figuring out.
So far, I am pleased with this product.  I am planning to use two of these heaters for my 600 sq. foot apartment this winter instead of fuel oil.  It already has been down in the low 30's two nights in a row here in the foothills, and it was just a wee bit chilly using one of the heaters, but not overly so.  I bought a second heater today. I am still tinkering with the adjustable thermostat. 
I grew up with a wood heater and this heater beats that scenario by a mile.

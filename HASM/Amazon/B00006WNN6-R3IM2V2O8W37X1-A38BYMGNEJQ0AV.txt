Title: doesn't stay on
Content:
I've had this thing for a day now and can't get it to stay on for more than a minute or two. The only way I can get it to turn back on is to unplug it for a few minutes (as the directions suggest), then plug it back in. Works great for another 2 minutes, then turns itself off again. Plus, what's up with heaters that have no handle or off switch, like this one? I'm returning it.

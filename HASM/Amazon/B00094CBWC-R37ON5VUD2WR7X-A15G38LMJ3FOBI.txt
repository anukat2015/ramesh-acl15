Title: No Noise Please
Content:
This heater warms the room very evenly; my husband and I use it in our home office (12 x 14 room). We have tried many different heaters only to find them either too noisy or too directional leaving parts of the room too hot or cold. This small in size heater puts out plenty of heat and has a very, very, small sound level that is actually pleasant for background noise while reading or doing computer work. We were so impressed that we bought a second one for our bedroom. We have lowered our furnace temperature and now use the heater to keep individual rooms comfortable. We both feel it is a good product and would recommend it to friends or family.

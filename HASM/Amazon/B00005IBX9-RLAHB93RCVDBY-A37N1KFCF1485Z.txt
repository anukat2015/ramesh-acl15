Title: Was worth the money...
Content:
I was so excited to buy this coffee pot after reading the wonderful reviews. I bought the refurbished one to save $$...and less than a year later, it hasn't been working the greatest. The drip got clogged and would take sometimes 2 hours to brew a pot (a little vinegar cleared that up) - but the carafe leaks. A huge pet peave - when you pour coffee and it dribbles on the counter. That is why I spent more money on one of these, to avoid the dripage - but, here we are again dealing with it. I am overall happy with the pot, I just wish I would have bought a new one instead of a refurbished one (no warranty on mine, a year with a new one).

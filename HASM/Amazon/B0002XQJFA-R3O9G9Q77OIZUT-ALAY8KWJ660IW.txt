Title: Great Camera - but check out the Rebel XT
Content:
I just got this 20D from Amazon last week.  I ordered the body only and the EF-S 17-85 IS lens with it.  Shipping was on-time.  Regarding the camera - it takes great pictures but man is it heavy!  With the EF-S 17-85 lens, it feels like it weighs 5 pounds when it is hanging from my neck or when I'm holding it.  The build quality is excellent, though.  However, I can't help but think I should have compromised for the new Digital Rebel XT.  The XT and 20D have nearly the same image quality (8.2MP for the 20D and 8.0MP for the XT) and have the exact same processor (Digic II).  However, the build quality of the XT is noticeably cheaper and flimsier than the 20D.  But, at a savings of $500 dollars, I'd highly recommend taking a serious look at the XT.  Its significantly lighter and will probably be around longer than the 20D (Web rumors suggest that Canon will replace the 20D around Christmas with a newer prosumer DSLR that will be rougly analogous to the Mark 1D (11.1MP, etc.).  As it stands, Canon has released a new prosumer model almost annualy since 1999.  And $500 dollars is still $500 dollars.  I would suggest going to a local retailer (like Best Buy) to play with both models before you make a purchase.  Either way, I would recommend buying from Amazon.  I have used Amazon.com for 2 years now and have had no complaints with them thus far.  Also, I would highly recommend checking out www.dpreview.com and www.bobatkins.com to read other reviews of these and other cameras.  I found these sites to be helpful when I was preparing for my purchase.  
The bottom line is that I am pleased with the 20D, the 17-85 lens, and the ordering/shipping process as well. I hope you find this review helpful.

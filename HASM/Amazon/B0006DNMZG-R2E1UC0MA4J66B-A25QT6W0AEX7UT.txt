Title: Good portable heater
Content:
I have purchased space heaters this season for two reasons: to make individual rooms more comfortable, plus having a heat source that can operator on a  portable generator if we have another major power outage.  This unit is light weight, quiet, easy to use, and was rated #2 by Consumer's Reports.  A fair price for  a good product.

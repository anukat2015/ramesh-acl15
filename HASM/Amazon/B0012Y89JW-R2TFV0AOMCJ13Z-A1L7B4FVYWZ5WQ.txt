Title: Canon Rebel XSI is an Excellent Camera
Content:
I have 2 DSLR's, a Nikon D40 and a Canon Digital Rebel XSI. Between the 2 I personally like the Canon, for the very better image quality, where as the Nikon has better Noise control. Better noise control DOES NOT mean better Pictures, far and away from it. On the Nikon I can get a fairly decent Photo at ISO 3200, but being the Canon doesn't have ISO 3200  I CAN'T COMMENT, but I will compare at 1600 and see what differnce their is.
As far as which I will carry with me at most times will be the Canon.
I have only had the XSI a few Days, and haven't had time to mess with Live view or things such as that, but will update in a couple of weeks or so
UPDATE:
I got around to messing around withe Live View feature and it will come in handy, BUT call me old fashioned, I still prefer the Viewfinder on a SLR when taking my Pictures, even though times have changed, I am just used to the Viewfinder for the past 20 years.

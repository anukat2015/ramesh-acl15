Title: Simply Good
Content:
This is a great MP3 player with great sound and good equalizer, and the other features like radio and the excelent quality of video display are things to enjoy! Also, the fact that accepts several video formats is a plus. The software is very good and easy to use.
Only Cons
- the buttons could be more modern fashioned... make it look very old style!
-the earphones are very... very common?
-may be the size sometimes make it not very portable and it's something to care about.

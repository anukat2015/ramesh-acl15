Title: too noisy
Content:
This heater warms up my home office nicely, however it's too noisy.   It's as noisy in the low setting as in the high setting.   If it was half as noisy I wouldn't be so disappointed.
Hi and Lo settings definitively vary in the amount of electricity they use, but I don't notice differences in noise.
I will exchange it for something that doesn't use a fan.  I still give it a 3 because it works great at the costco price.

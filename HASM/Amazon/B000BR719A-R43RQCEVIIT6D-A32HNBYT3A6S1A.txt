Title: Mr. Coffee Rules!!!
Content:
Great coffee maker...very easy to use.  The only down side is the white on the top of the lid to the pot will obviously get stained with coffee, but that is to be expected.  Very quick to brew, and it is great to be able to pour a cup while it is still brewing.  Definetely would get another...maybe a darker one next time.

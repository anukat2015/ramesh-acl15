Title: Get a Sony.
Content:
I bought this player.  So did my daughter.  Neither one of us dropped it.  Hers worked maybe 20 hours.  Mine worked for maybe seven, MAX.  They just STOPPED.  Chargers are still good, so it wasn't that, nor are we technologically incompetent.  Piece of junk.  Buy a SONY.

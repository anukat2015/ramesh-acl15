Title: Worst Seller Ever
Content:
I bought a Zune from this Seller and it was defective during its first use.  I asked for help; she told me what to do to get it to charge.  It did not work.  I let her know this and she said I could return it.  I inquired about recouping the cost of my return postage; she said she would pay it but it would have to be through Paypal. I agreed and sent back the Zune.  When I emailed her as to the status of my return shipping, she told me that since the Zune worked for her she would not refund my return postage.  She also accused me of lying about the amount I requested for return postage ($8.75 v. $4.75 which she claims was on the box, but did not take me up on my offer to send her a scanned copy of the receipt which I finally discarded thinking she was refunding my return postage - silly me).  I have filed a complaint with Amazon under the A-Z Guarantee on this.  Also very disconcerting to have a Seller call you a "liar" and "untruthful" in an email.  I simply wanted a product that worked when plugged in as a gift for a dear friend.  I have been doing business on Amazon Marketplace and Ebay for years and have never had an experience like this.  Apparently the Zune she sold me was "on a shelf" for a while which is why it didn't charge.  I never could get it to work.  Under Amazon's policy, "item defective during first use" is a reason to return it.  Instead, I am lambasted by the Seller and called slanderous names.  For the money you think you're saving buying from this Seller, go to the nearest Best Buy and rest assured that you're getting a product that works the first time you plug it in, and without the negative and meanspirited comments.

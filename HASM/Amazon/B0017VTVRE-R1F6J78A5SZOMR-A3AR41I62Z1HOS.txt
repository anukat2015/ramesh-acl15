Title: Best Meile we've owned
Content:
We had a Miele Flamenco (entry model) for 10 years that finally weakened due to 10 years of Collie hair. The dogs are now gone (RIP) and we impulse bought a Dyson, which was possibly the worst move of my life (negative review in my review section.) Whereas the Miele is light and powerful, the Dyson is clumsy and powerful, twice as heavy, cheaply made (wheel fell off, hand extension won't retract fully), and the attachments were always falling off. I love that the Meile has a foot switch to suck up the chord (Dyson's are old-school, wind it yourself.) All the attachments are in a little cubby in the front of the unit, and the bag is twice the size of our last Miele. It was worth the money loss to get a Miele again. It can get under practically anything, it's powerful but not too loud, and it's looks pretty cool to boot. I expect it to be around 20 years from now, 15 if we get more Collies.

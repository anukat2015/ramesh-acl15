Title: Not what I expected.
Content:
I've owned this camera for about two months now and it doesn't live up to what I thought it would be like.  I've taken well over 1,000 pictures and I've only gotten about 40 good pictures out of all of them.  My point and shoot camera has produced better crisper photos than this camera has.  
I only used the lens that came with the camera, so I'm not sure if it's just the lens that comes with the camera that's making it so bad, or if it's the camera itself.  I'll probably update this later if it's just the lens.  
Pros: You can switch out the lenses, it's pretty lightweight, it has a pretty good layout of buttons and everything is pretty easy to use.
Cons: Won't let you get up really close to something to take a picture, even on macro, It won't take a picture at night time (I've tried several times and it hardly ever takes the picture and when it does it takes about 5 mins to even focus on a street light), sometimes it won't focus on what I want it to focus on, it already has dust on the censor and I've never changed out the lens.
I gave it a 3 because I'm not too impressed with the camera, but I'm also not sure if it just needs a better lens.  So, it might be the lens, it might not, but if it's the lens, then it makes all the difference with this camera.

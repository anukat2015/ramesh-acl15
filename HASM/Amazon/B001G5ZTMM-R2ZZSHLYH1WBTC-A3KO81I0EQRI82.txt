Title: canon service
Content:
There's been enough reviews on this camera so this isn't a camera review it concerns sending my new 5D Mark 2 in for cleaning.
Canon no longer cleans the sensor, mirror, or focus screen for free if it's still under warranty. They told me they changed that and it is now $100 for cleaning. The California center is less friendly then the east coast center. The main dial on top of the camera, the one for manual, AP, etc was loose as well. They wouldn't tighten it unless I paid for the cleaning, they also wanted to replace the focus screen and wanted 200$ to do that. The focus screen cost 40$ and can be purchased through a number of qualified dealers and changed out by yourself in 10 mins. 
I've dealt with Canon for years and it used to be that the service center charged nominal fees if anything at all, all that has changed. 
It's a wonderful product but be careful if you need to send it in, even if it is under warranty expect a bill. Call them first so you know what to expect.

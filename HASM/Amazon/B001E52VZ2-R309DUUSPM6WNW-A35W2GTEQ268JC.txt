Title: Very Good Workhorse.
Content:
This is my second Eureka.  The first a Eureka  100 - a BIG Floor standing Model.  This died on me after fifteen years.  Was too big and heavy.
The Mighty Mite was ordered and delivered within one week.
Tried it out the same day - This machine S U C K S !! (I mean the DUST)
The lightweight is very handy.  Did my 3 Bedroon unit with upstairs and stairs without much effort.  The extra brushes, and long handle and tubes are very good for window sills and odd corners.  Does hard floors well.  
The free shippind was a great help.  With a little addition to qualify for FREE SHIPPING - I got the Bissell Featherweight Bagless, which I ordered together for a
really great deal.
 A very good buy through Amazon.   Very Happy with machine. Thanks Amazon for assisting  in the Free Shipping.

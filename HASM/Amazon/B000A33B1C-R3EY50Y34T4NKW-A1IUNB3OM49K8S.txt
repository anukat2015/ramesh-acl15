Title: Good Choice for Space Heating
Content:
I have previously owned a similar product by Delonghi and was very pleased with it.  We also own some heaters at work.  I like the fact that you can adjust the settings easily and the heat is comfortable rather quickly.  It takes up little space and is safe around pets and children.  A good purchase for the money.

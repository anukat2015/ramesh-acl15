Title: Short Life Span
Content:
I bought my wife a second shuffle after the first one failed at around a year. They were so cheap I just got another. The second lasted about ten months. Apple claims a one year warranty. This means they will send you a refurbished replacement. I have just sent the third replacement back as they have all failed. I do not believe there are humans that are concerned about my problem at Apple. Spend a few more dollars and get something that will work.

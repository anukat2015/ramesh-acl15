Title: Very good, solid digital SLR
Content:
I have had the D50 for almost a year--and have been very satisfied with it. (Over the years, I have had an assortment of SLRs and digital SLRs, from Canon and Olympus.) With the D50, I have taken some great photos (usually in raw) on trips in the States and overseas. Although it may not compare with higher-dollar digital SLRs (like the Canon 20D and 30D), it really blows away similar-dollar digital SLRs (like the Canon Rebel and Rebel XT). The Rebel XT may have more MPs, but it feels like a plastic toy in your hand. You click a photo, and it sounds and feels like a toy. The D50 is so much more solid. You click a photo, and it sounds and feels like a machine. For the price, the D50 is unbeatable.

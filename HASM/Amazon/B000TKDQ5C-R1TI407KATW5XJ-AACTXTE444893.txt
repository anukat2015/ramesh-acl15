Title: Cheap in Every Way
Content:
This heater is a piece of hot garbage!  I bought it for use in a 12' by 10' room here in Afghanistan and for the two weeks it actually worked it sounded like a lawnmower, the fan may have been off center.  It put out barely enough heat to warm my room when it was on and the constant noise kept me awake anyways.  After about two weeks of use I heard a pop, saw a spark, and smelled burnt electronics.  The fan does not turn anymore and the unit puts out no heat at all so I put it back in the box (I'm not allowed to throw away electronic devices here in Afghanistan and it's not worth the cost of sending it back).  I purchased a Honeywell Cool Touch Energy Smart Heater as a replacement and it was worth every penny of the extra $30 it cost me.  Do not buy the Lasko 754200, it is not worth any price!

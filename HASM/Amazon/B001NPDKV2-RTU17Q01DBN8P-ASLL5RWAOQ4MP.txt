Title: Great BANG for the BUCK!
Content:
I won't restate what have already been covered.   If you are looking for an inexpensive laptop that covers all the basic plus some, this is it.   Internet, email, games, movie watching, and portable.
I am a techie and while I agree that all the components are not the top of the line, it is an AWESOME laptop from my wife's perspective!!  The only thing that took some getting used to was the keyboard is like a full 101 PC keyboard.  It has a full 10 key which shifts the QWERETY over a touch.
I would recommend it and after owning it for 3 months, I would buy one again!   As far as the price goes, look around and don't pay about $420 for it.  You should be able to find this unit for around $399-$419 after rebates.

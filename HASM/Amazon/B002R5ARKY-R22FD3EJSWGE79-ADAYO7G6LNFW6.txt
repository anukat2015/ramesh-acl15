Title: Horrible Customer Service
Content:
Their customer service is terrible. They manufacture faulty laptops and try to evade doing repairs on them. Just search online to see all these issues. We didn't use the laptop for a good 6 months after we bought it and the mother board was a little faulty. It was a week out of warranty when it completely went out and they want to charge us 75% of the price of a new laptop to replace it. Just look at all the horror stories online. Horrible company that makes faulty products. Don't buy. Go with a Toshiba, I bought a very cheap one 6 years ago, upgraded the RAM on it and it still runs like a champ.

Title: Great for a very narrow use
Content:
The reason to buy this is to have a PC wherever you go.  It is the only PC I've seen small enough to carry anywhere, but still be functional.  That's where it's great and worth $900 for those willing and able to spend so much.  On the other hand, it is too small to serve as my primary laptop.   I bought an Asus eeePC when it first came out.  The keyboard is narrower than the Sony, and I could never get used to it.  While it is very small, the Sony is much shorter and thinner and easier to carry, and the AC adapter is tiny.  Like other Sony laptops, and unlike most Windows laptops, the screen is very bright.  The smallness of the fonts is not a problem in browsing and most programs because the font size can be adjusted easily enough without any major tradeoff.  Other programs, like Outlook, and working within Windows are much more eye challenging.  I've owned four or so Sony laptops over the years and always liked their size, aesthetics, and screens, but they are Windows machines and don't begin to compare with the MacBook Air, which is by far the best laptop I've ever had (which goes back over 20 years).  If and when Apple has a product comparable to the Sony Vaio P, I'll likely be one of the first purchasers.

Title: It's worth the money and not that hard to clean
Content:
Several cutomers rated the machine as nearly impossible,because of the hard process of cleaning the machine?   It's not hard to clean, the grinder just rinse it out because the water that's heated fogs up the grinder.  All the parts, just rinse it out or use some soap for that new clean feel.  The procrastinators-are they crying about cleaning, does that mean they never wash out their coffee makers, drinking out of the machine with the crud building up into a glob of mud-come on, after brewing the coffee at 6AM, by 10AM it's still warm-no worry about leaving the house with the thought-Did I leave the coffee maker on?!?Once the machine makes the coffee-it automatically shuts itself off, no hot plate to keep the coffee warm-then burnt along with your home.

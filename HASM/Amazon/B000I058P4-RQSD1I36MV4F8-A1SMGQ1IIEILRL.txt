Title: Lukewarm, metal tasting coffee
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker for the size and style but was very unhappy with it.  Even when first brewed, the coffee isn't hot and there's a strong taste of metal in the coffee.  Several washings in hot soapy water and several pots of coffee did nothing to get rid of the metal taste.  I'm definitely throwing this coffee pot BACK.

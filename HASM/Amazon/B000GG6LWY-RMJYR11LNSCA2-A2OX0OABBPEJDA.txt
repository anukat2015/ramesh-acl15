Title: Good price for the heat, but some chinsy worksmanship
Content:
[...]  Wife's very happy with it, since she's cold all the time.
Definitely got the "button" problem the other reviewer mentioned.  The button was very "chinsy".  Even brand new, you can feel somehow the button surface and the tigger below are not well connected.  Within 2 months, the button surface cracked and broke.  The larger issue is that every 5 - 10 minutes, the overheat warming light goes on and the heater shuts off to cool down.  How in the world it would overheat, I don't know (It's a heater!)  We returned to Sams right away, got a new one.  Will have to see how long this one lasts!
Suggestion: Keep your receipt, wait and see!

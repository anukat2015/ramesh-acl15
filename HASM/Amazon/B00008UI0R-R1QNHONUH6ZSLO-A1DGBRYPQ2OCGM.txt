Title: My first "adult" vacuum cleaner
Content:
Very effective even in a house with 3 long hair cats! Make sure the filter/dust container is fully inserted. Powerful, not clumsy, well designed. 
Disclaimer - I had it only for about a month so I cannot testify about wear and tear (loss of power over time, etc...) but so far - I am satisfied.

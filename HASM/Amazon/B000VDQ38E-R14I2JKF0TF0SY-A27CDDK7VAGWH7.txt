Title: Don't waste your money
Content:
At first it worked great.  Just like all the reviews said.  Now, about 3 months later, it is totally useless.   The lint brush on the front does nothing but move some of the hair around ( which never really worked anyway). I just vacuumed a 5x7 rug for 30 minutes and gobs of cat hair are left behind. After I am finished vacuuming I get down on my hands and knees with a brush to get the cat hair.  I replaced all the filters, empty the cup every time (sometimes twice) but nothing helps.    I only have 2 cats, so that should not be too much for a "Pet Eraser"! Just buy a cheap vacuum or keep your old vacuum before you waste your money on this useless vacuum.

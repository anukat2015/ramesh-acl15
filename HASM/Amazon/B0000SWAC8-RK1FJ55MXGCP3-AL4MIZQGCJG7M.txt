Title: Get Bags!
Content:
This is a fabulous vacuum cleaner! It really picks up the dust and dirt but be aware that it only comes with 1 bag...at least the refurbished one I bought did. The bags are fairly small and if your house is dusty or you haven't vacuumed with a vac of this caliber in a while, the bag will fill up fast. I only got my bedroom and the hall vacuumed before the bag was full and there were no more. The refurbished vac arrived the day after I ordered...lightening fast...but the bags were days behind and I got antsy waiting for them to arrive!

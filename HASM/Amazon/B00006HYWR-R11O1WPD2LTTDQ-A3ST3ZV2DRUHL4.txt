Title: Bad idea for runners...good otherwise
Content:
If you're looking for a product that will accompany you on long runs, this is not the one. The player comes with neck strap allowing the player to constantly move as you do. To keep it stable, you must use an armband (not included in this buy, see manufacturer's site for the limited edition bundle, same player with armband) or pin/tuck it into the waistband of your shorts. Then comes the fact that sweat (a big No-No) will get into the player, causing it to break very easily. This model is very volatile when it comes to any amount of moisture. I've only had the product for two months and although the sound quality is good and the downloading easy, it's not exactly practical for a workout model. I recommend this product for folks who aren't looking to take it into the gym.

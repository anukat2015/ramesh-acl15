Title: great little coffeemaker
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker to replace my old regular sized one that finally broke.  I'm the only one in the house that drinks coffee and I only have two cups in the morning so this was just the right size.
It makes 20 oz. of coffee - which is perfect for my 10 oz. coffee mug.  I haven't had a problem with it losing time or gaining minutes - I unplug it every morning when it's done anyway.  No problems with setting it up at night and having my coffee ready when I wake up, either!
And quiet?  I didn't realize how noisy my old one was until I got this one.  
Coffee quality is great.  I borrowed one from my mom for the few days between when the old one broke and this one arrived.  It was awful.  It brewed the water through so fast, I had a see-through clear brownish liquid in the pot when it was done - 2 minutes later.  I literally had to use twice as much coffee in that thing.  This Mr. Coffee 4-cup uses the same amount of coffee I've always used - 1 heaping Tbsp. per mug.  Brews an excellent cup of coffee.  And for the price - can't beat it!
If you don't need more than 20 oz. of coffee - this is the perfect coffeemaker!

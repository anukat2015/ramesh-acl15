Title: Light, powerful
Content:
Just received and tried. Vac is really light, really powerful, nice looking. Picks up dust no problem. Drawbacks: paper dust bag is small; probably it will require replacement once a week. Still unknown how much is 'lifetime dust bag replacement' for delivery. I let you know when I know. Hose is made of plastic, so, a lot of dust on it after vacuuming. In general, not bad for cleaning stairs, for example. Joseph

Title: great for carpetless floors
Content:
The dirt devil non-turbo attachment head works great on my wood and slate floors. The turbo head is probably good with carpet(though my house is carpetless) The best features are the telescoping wand and retractable cord. Light weight enough to carry rather than roll when in tight spots. Variable suction power is a nice feature too. And it didn't even seem to bother my cat.(Anyone know how to get HIM to vacuum up his own cat hair?)

Title: Very happy with my purchase
Content:
As an amateur photographer who has used a conventional film SLR (Olympus OM-1) for years and transitioned to digital with a lesser camera before purchasing the EVOLT E500 kit, I think I made the right choice.  The overall package of picture quality, camera construction quality, logic of controls, and general "feel" is right where I hoped it would be.
A couple of more specific comments:
Some reviewers have commented on the relatively small viewfinder.  I was concerned about it before seeing the camera, but as soon as I started taking pictures I realized it was not an issue.  I wear glasses most of the time and it is not a problem.  It can be difficult in brighter lighting to see the information to the right of the image in the viewfinder, though.
I find the menu system, particularly the ability to jump quickly into any part of it via the viewing screen, to be well done.  There are several pathways available to changing settings.
The kit lenses are only so-so.  Not long after I bought the kit, I upgraded to the 14-54 and 50-200 lenses, which are truly excellent.  Probably should have bought the body only and gone straight to these lenses.
The auto white-balance button is easy to press accidentally while taking a hurried action shot.  It just takes a bit of practice to avoid doing it.
The USB 1.1 means relatively slow transfer of images off the card, but I consider that a minor annoyance.
The LCD screen on back is superb.
In theory, at least, the automatic dust reduction system is a great feature.
Summary:
I have no second thoughts about this purchase.  I am really enjoying photography again, this time in the digital world.

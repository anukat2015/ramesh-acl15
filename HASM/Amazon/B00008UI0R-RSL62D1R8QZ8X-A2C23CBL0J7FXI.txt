Title: Love it!
Content:
I got my little "hoover canister WindTunnel" for Christmas. I am in "love" with a vacuum! The hardest test for any vacuum is to go from hard floors to rugs, or rubber backed throw rugs. I've worn out Kirby's, WindTunnel up-rights and a few shop vac's. This one wins hands down. Light weight, easy change vaccum, easy change parts for different jobs. One touch extendtion of handle, simple touch of your toe rolls the long cord in neat & tidy, easy store, and best of all that hepa filter washes up in the sink with the pop out catch all. Everything is nice and clean AND smells good for the next job.

Title: Good machine (but the key is the K-Cup)
Content:
After almost a month with the Keurig B70, I've finally come to truly enjoy my Keurig.
PROS:
* Sturdy machine
* Large water reservoir
* Reasonably quiet (main hum is during the priming of the pump)
* Reuseable Coffee Filter option - so not dependent on K-Cup vendors
CONS:
* Finding good K-cups that generate reasonable strength coffee
K-CUP RECOMMENDATION:
* Van Houte Coffee, Eclipse Blend
ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY:
My initial feeling was of disappointment after trying out the sample K-cups that came with the machine.  Setting the Keurig to the smallest cup setting, I was predominantely getting watered down coffee as others have reported in the list of reviews.
I ordered "Diedrich - French Roast Dark Roast" as it purportedly was a stronger coffee.  And, I did get a less watered down coffee.  But, still not what I was looking for.  Looking at the stream of coffee from the Keurig, it was still noticeably light compared to what one would typically make.
As a last attempt, I ordered "Van Houte Coffee, Eclipse Blend" which is reported to be one of the strongest coffees available in K-cup.  And, I finally got the strength of coffee that I was looking for.  The Van Houte is one of the more expensive K-cups available, but it is well worth the price, and it is still cheaper than getting coffee from a Starbucks or Peets.  I typically use 2 K-cups (a cost of about 80 cents in total) to fill a travel mug for work.

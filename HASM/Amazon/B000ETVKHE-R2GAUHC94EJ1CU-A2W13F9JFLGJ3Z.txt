Title: great mp3 player
Content:
just got mine a few weeks ago, and i love it. great sound, perfect size. fits right and snug in that little mini pocket just above the main pocket on your pants. the head phones that come with it are surprisingly pretty good. love all the features. the wheel irritates my thumb a little sometimes, but it's no biggie.

Title: Wonderful space heat
Content:
I bought this product to replace a Soleus heater I had got back quite a few years ago. I like the quietness of the product, and the heat it gives off.  I am always more cold than my husband, so I use this in front of me when I watch tv, and also take it with me when I work sometimes.  It throws off very good heat, and keeps our furnace in the room from kicking on.  The only drawback is when you are watching tv at night, it does throw off alot of light, so if you aim it right at yourself, it can be hard to watch tv.  I did go to the strore to replace the heater and could not find one, so I tried something else, I was not saisfied with it at all, so I came back and ordered it here online, and I am so glad I did!

Title: EFS-18-55mm beats my EF100-400mm L IS Zoom lens with XSI 450D
Content:
I used the following settings (1/200 sec, f/25, AWB cloudy, AI SERVO AF flash exp comp +2, user def 1 with +7 sharpness, +1 contrast, +2 saturation, +2 color tone, hi-ISO speed noise reduction on, highlight tone priority enabled, auto lighting optimizer enabled) with flash on and took pictures from 5PM to 7PM and I got the clearest resolution ever from a kit lens!!!!

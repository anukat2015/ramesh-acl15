Title: Toshiba Satellite-nothing but trouble so far
Content:
I have had nothing but trouble ever since I placed this order. First, the computer arrived with a hole in the factory box, so I sent it back (At my expense)and reordered the computer again. In Jan 2010, I started using the replacement computer and after one month it would not work on battery power. This laptop will only work when the AC power is plugged in and shuts off will the AC is unplugged. Numerous calls to Toshiba and 3 weeks later I received a replacement battery. It still will not stay powered up on battery power. I Have an $800 laptop that doesn't work unless plugged in to AC power.  Now I have to send it to a repair depot.

Title: Great laptop at a great price
Content:
At $649 after rebate I think this laptop hits a real sweet spot in the 13" market! I've had it for a week now and am really enjoying it. I also purchased a Samsung slim DVD writer since this mahcine doesn't include an optical drive.
Pros: 
- Runs very cool with the Intel processor - have never had the fan kick on
- No problem streaming video, and has an HDMI for for your HDTV
- Best looking notebook for the price 
- Very fast and quiet hdd
- I have to admit I really am enjoying Windows 7 - I skipped the whole Vista thing
- The back lit LED screen is beautiful
- With 4GB RAM the system multi-taks very well
- Battery Life - I get 5 to 6 hrs with my custom settings, cross country trips on a plane are now a reality
- The keyboard is great to type on, although the use of a fn key to use f1-f12 isn't for me 
Cons: 
- Quite a bit of crapware and bloatware to get rid of
- The track pad leaves something to be desired - buggy in that it sometimes locks up from resume or comes back as a magnifying glass. You can find out how to fix this in the forurms...
- The mouse buttons on the track pad are too small and require too much pressure to click.
I used to travel with a back breaking 15.4 Dell M65, this will be a joy to travel with, and I will use it more at home because of how beautiful the screen is, and it is completely quiet. In my option you can't go wrong here.HP Pavilion DM3-1040US 13.3-Inch Silver Laptop - Up to 10 Hours of Battery Life (Windows 7 Home Premium)

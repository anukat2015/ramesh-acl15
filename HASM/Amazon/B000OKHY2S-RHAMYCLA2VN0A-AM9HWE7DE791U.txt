Title: Only works in the sahara
Content:
Evaporative coolers, also known as "swamp coolers" DO NOT WORK if there is any humidity in the air.  Unless you live in a high desert, these devices can actually add to your hot sweaty misery by increasing the humidity in your house and possibly even warming it because of heat generated by the fan and pumps.  Higher humidity can even cause mold and mildew problems. Remember if the air is saturated with humidity the water in this device can't evaporate and it can't cool the air. 
High desert = Great
Anywhere else = Don't bother

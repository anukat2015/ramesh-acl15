Title: Breville single-cup Brewer
Content:
What can I say, I just love it. My husband who never drinks coffee has started drinking it since I got this, My 8 year old loves to make hot coco with it everyday. And I use it everyday too. I love the single cup teas and coffee's made for this brewer. I also love that you can use regular, teas, coffees and coco's with this too. My daughter for example puts the coco she wants in her cup hits brew and out comes the hot water, she then add some 1/2 and 1/2 and she has a great cup of hot chocolate. I wish I had bought one sooner. Well worth the price in my opinion. Also clean up with the k-cup is so easy. just remove and toss in trash. No more coffee grounds to deal with or filters. My family just loves it.

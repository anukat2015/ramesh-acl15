Title: For the price, its OK.
Content:
For $500, its decent, but the quality level is poor. The display is abysmal, with a viewing angle of a cheap digital camera. The blacks look blue when you move your head more than an inch in either direction from dead center. I suppose it is relatively sharp, but that's about it. The touch pad is just awful--as is the click pad beneath it. Both are either unresponsive, or clunky feeling (click pad). However, the keyboard is definitely good and feels tactile and responsive. The sound 'quality' haha...is a joke. Its hallow sounding and practically useless, I would use headphones instead. There are plenty of ports and they are located well. The battery doesn't come near the 4.5 hours quoted in the description. 
The bottom line is the physical laptop just feels cheap and is not at all enjoyable. From the clickpad being clunky and plastic feeling, to the sticky opening of the display. 
I would not recommend this laptop, even in this price range there are better options.

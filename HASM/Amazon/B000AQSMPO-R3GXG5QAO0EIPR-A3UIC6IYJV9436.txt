Title: i'll admit i like it!
Content:
I just ordered a new coffee maker off amazon, and it hadn't arrived before I went out of town and visited my mom and dad.
They have one of these contraptions.
At first I was horrified at the idea of "contained" coffee where its all premeasured, and etc.
I'm a french press and espresso kind of gal- I like it as close to as nature intended it as possible. Also I drink a LOT of coffee, and usually need to prepare a thermos for the hubby before he goes to work. Also, I like trying different roasts and brands, and didnt think you could do that with this.
HOWEVER. It works really fast. I dig that. And if you just want a quick pick me up without a lot of fuss, this is both the bees knees and the cats pyjamas.
The coffee WILL be the same every time if you use the prepackaged stuff. Also, i think that brewing the pods twice really waters the coffee down, so i'd prefer to use more(ie use the pod once and ditch it.)
Or you can buy your own and use the little thing that you can put your own in. using that with some community coffee i was able to brew a REALLY satisfying cup. 
I also like the darker roasts. Though they may not brew up as strongly as what i'm used to, for the average joe it would be fabulous.
So.
Even though I like to think I'm a snob, I have to admit I like this thing. It's well worth the extra $$ for the convenience, And i think that the bit about being able to satisfy a lot of people if they want different people in a short amount of time is FABULOUS.
So there.

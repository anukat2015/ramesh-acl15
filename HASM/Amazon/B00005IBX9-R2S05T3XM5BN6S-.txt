Title: Sleek Coffee Maker, Excellent Performance
Content:
The Cuisinart DCC-1200 is as good as the best reviews to date. I purchased the coffee maker three months ago after reading the reviews and noting both the positives and the negatives. The sleek design and exceptional performance make this a functional toy that is a true gift to myself. Other reviewers have noted a condensation from lid. I am in agreement with the solution that propping open the lid slightly after use ensures no drips behind the machine.Truly an exceptional item, among the few that make me feel like I'm treating myself every morning. Buy this!

Hi I just had to return the camera because it was not functioning correctly. I've used that camera before and I wanted another one because I was going to a convention and need a good camera. I had the camera for a few weeks and just took some pictures. When I went away, the camera's flash did not work right. It came up with an error code 5 and said to shut the camera off and back on. I did that but it still did not work. I believe the camera was a defect so I had returned it. I will still buy another camera from Amazon as soon as I'm credited for this one. I also had another problem with Amazon's shipping. I had ordered an extra Battery for the camera I believe on Nov 11, I was leaving for my conference on the 15th so I had the battery expidited. I was supposed to get it on the 13th or 14 th, the battery came on the 17th when I was away. I paid for the expidited shipping but I did not come!!Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Black)

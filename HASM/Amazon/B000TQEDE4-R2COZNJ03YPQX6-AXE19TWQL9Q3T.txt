Title: Cuisinart programmable thermal coffee maker
Content:
We are satisfied with the coffee maker, but we wish the thermal container could also be reheated.  Before purchase we did not realize that the carafe, while it holds the temperature for an hour or so, cold not be reheated. There is no heating element below the carafe, so once the coffee has cooled you have to reheat coffee in a cup in the microwave. Too bad there couldn't  have been a heating element and an extra glass carafe with choice of reheating.

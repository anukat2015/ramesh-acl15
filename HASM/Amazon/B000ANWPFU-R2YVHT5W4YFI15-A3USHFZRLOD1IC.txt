Title: Leaks Oil
Content:
I just bought a second of these units, having been pleased with the first unit for the last two years.  Excellent thermostat, good (not overwhelming) heat output - adequate for an average sized room... no problems.
UNTIL...
I noticed a 2" oil spot under the first (oldest) of my two heaters.  Fortunately, this unit was on a hardwood floor, so cleanup was easy.  However, I suspect the unit is kaput, because as it continues to loose oil, it will eventually cease to function.
Now, I am very nervous about the newer unit, because it is located on (new!) carpet.  If it leaks oil, cleanup will NOT be easy.  
The leaking unit has never been dropped or mistreated, though it has been running constantly for the past two months.  The leak is VERY disappointing.  I mean, of all and any quality control issues the manufacturer should ensure, NOT LEAKING OIL would have to be the first and foremost in importance.  
Too, bad.  And even worse, I suspect oil leaks might not be unique to this brand and model, though I have owned no others.  I would give these units five stars except for my experience in having one of them spew oil on my hardwood floor.

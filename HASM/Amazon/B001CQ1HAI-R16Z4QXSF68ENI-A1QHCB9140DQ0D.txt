Title: poor construction
Content:
THIS PRODUCT CAME IN THE MAIL POORLY CONSTRUCTED. THE SECTION THAT HOLDS THE COFFE BASKET DID NOT LINE UP WITH THE REST OF THE COFFEE MAKER AND THE LID, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO SNAP SHUT BARELY DOES SO BECAUSE OF THE MISMATCHED CONSTRUCTION. A TUBE IN THE WELL FOR THE WATER HAS A TUBE TO READ THE NUMBER OF CUP OF WATER WHEN FILLED. THE TUBE IS SWAYED, NOT STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN AND DOES NOT MATCH THE NUMBER OF CUPS IN THE CARAFE. SO IF THE CARAFE SAYS 8 CUPS , THE TUBE SAYS 6.  THAT SAID IT MAKES DECENT COFFEE AND I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO PACK IT UP TO SEND BACK SINCE IT DOES NOT GO BACK TO AMAZON. I ALSO WISH THE COFFEE WAS HOTTER, BUT IT IS AS HOT AS ANY OTHER COFFE MAKER I TRIED. MY RESEARCH SHOW THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL DRIP COFFE MAKER OUT THAT MAKES COFFEE AS HOT AS IT SHOULD BE.

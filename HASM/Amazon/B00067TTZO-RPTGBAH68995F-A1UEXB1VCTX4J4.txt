Title: Excellent player
Content:
I love this player. The sound is just fantastic. It is small and light.  My other player is a Zen Xtra - the menus are similar and it took no time at all to find my way around the Micro.  No problem between the player and my computer, not a single lockup.  There are loads of options in the menus to customize.  I like the equalizer.  The touchpad was easy to get used to.  I saw some people saying that the touchpad is too sensitive, but you can ajust that. I haven't needed to. I do use the hold button because I slip the player in my pocket.  I'm very happy with the battery life - though I've not timed it, I used the player for a few days before noticing it was on the last bar.  Not a single problem with it, I love it.

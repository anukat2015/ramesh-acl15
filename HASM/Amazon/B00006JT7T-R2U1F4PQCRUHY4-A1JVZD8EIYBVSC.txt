Title: Pretty Good
Content:
I would have given this 5 stars but it took awhile to get the remote control in sync with the unit.  I found that if you took the batteries out the remote and put them back in again, the unit will work.  It gives off decent heat and heats up a room in no time at all.  I have a sun porch that is all windows and has no radiators and it's perfect for that room. Do not let young children near this even when it's not plugged in.  My son shoved pennies in it and broke it.  It will probably cost more to fix then I paid for it so I might buy another one.

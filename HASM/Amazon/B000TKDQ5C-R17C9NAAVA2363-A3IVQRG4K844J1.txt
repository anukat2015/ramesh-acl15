Title: It is VERY LOUD!
Content:
Now, I realized that I should've listened to someone's complaint about the product. If you don't mind some noise around you, then it would work for you. It doesn't oscillate and it is also true that it shuts off when you turn it down to 2 out of 8[?]. However, it will make you keep warm, at least. I don't think it is good to be under the desk. It would fit better in the large space, although it is small. Who says that it is quiet? It is not true. I'm going to return it.

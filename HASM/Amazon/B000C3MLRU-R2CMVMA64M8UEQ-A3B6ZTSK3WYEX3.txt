Title: good, not best but good buy all around
Content:
This unit is good if left on, it uses less electricity, but doesn't heat as fast as a hot air heater.. I got this unit because it saves energy thus money, and it does exactly what i needed it to do. I suggest this unit if you want to heat areas that do not have high in and out ( as in outdoors) traffic, and you are trying to save money on the heat bill..
Great for basements!

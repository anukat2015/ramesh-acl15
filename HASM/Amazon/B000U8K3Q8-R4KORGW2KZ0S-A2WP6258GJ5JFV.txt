Title: Puts out heat, but flimsy
Content:
Recently bought this space heater after researching the "patented" heating process.  I had planned to buy the larger model, but this one was in stock.  It is small and lightweight--too lightweight for safety considerations, as it is very easy to tip over.  The base is smaller than the rest of the unit, which makes it even more unstable.  When it does tip over, the shutoff feature only works if it falls forward.  If it falls backward, it just keeps on running.  (I tried it several times, just to make sure it was not a fluke.)  It does put out a lot of heat for a small unit, but I could not see any difference between this heater's supposedly superior heating design and similar space heaters.  It might be useful under a desk or a small bathroom, if you were not worried about tipping it over and you bought it for less than $35.

Title: One start is an overstatement
Content:
I have probably used the coffemaker no more than 20 times; the coffee tasted great.  Then it began to leak around the bottom.  This morning, after putting in 6 cups of water and mopping 5 cups off my counter I decided to see if I could find a solution on line.  Having read various complaints not only about the leaking problem but about DeLonghi's customer service I decided to toss the thing in the garbage.  I will never buy another DeLonghi product.

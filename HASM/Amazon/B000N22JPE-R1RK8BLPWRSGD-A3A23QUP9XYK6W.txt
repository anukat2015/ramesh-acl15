Title: Excellent Coffee Maker!!
Content:
We have had this Cuisinart coffee maker for a month now and we absolutely love it.  When our Bunn konked out, we decided to replace it with a percolating coffee maker and we will never go back to a Bunn again.  Percolated coffee is so much better!  This Cuisinart is easy to use, doesn't take up much room on the counter and makes a wonderful, HOT pot of coffee.  I make 7 cups and it takes about five minutes to brew.  My favorite features of the product are: the handle on the carafe, which is designed ergonomically correct and is so comfortable to hold and the programmable auto-off feature.  My husband likes the programmable auto-on feature.  The coffee maker comes with a permanent filter which we used one time but found that it is too hard to get all the grounds out when dumped in the trash can (we do not put grounds down the garbage disposal.)  We use the disposable filters instead, which are easy to insert and easy to dump out.  I would HIGHLY recommend this coffee maker.

Title: Excellent Camera
Content:
This camera is everything I expected and more.  I wanted a digital SLR camera that could take good pictures in any setting and this camera fits the bill.  The price I purchased this for on Amazon was about $75 less than what I could find it in the local stores plus I signed up for Amazon Prime and received FREE 2 day shipping.
The camera is easy to use. It powers up quickly and fits comfortly in my hands. One of the questions I researched was the refresh time of the flash and any delay in taking the flash pictures. With this camera, I am able to quickly take multiple flash pictures. 
I'm an amatuer photograher and look forward to learning how to use all the settings available to me with this camera.

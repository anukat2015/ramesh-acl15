Title: "lukewarm" recommendation
Content:
We bought this coffeemaker to replace a Mr. Coffee w/ thermal carafe we'd had for over five years.  The machine itself still worked great, but the  digital time read-out was failing. Though the Mr. Coffee would have been fine to keep, I wanted a white coffee maker w/ thermal carafe to match our new kitchen.  The Cuisinart was the only option I could find for under $100.  Compared to the Mr. Coffee, the Cuisinart is just okay.  It's easy to set up, the brew time isn't too slow, I like the "beep" it makes when the coffee's ready, the coffee tastes fine, the machine itself is nice-looking.  What I don't like is that it only keeps the coffee really hot for an hour or so and, because the spout and top of the carafe are white, they stain easily.  (The ridge design of the spout makes it difficult to clean. Have to soak the top in a weak bleach solution, which probably isn't good for the seals.)  Also, we've just had the machine for two months and the shelf where the carafe sits has already become scratched from removing and replacing the carafe to pour coffee.  
I don't expect the Cuisinart to last as long as our Mr. Coffee.  I'd probably order the Cuisinart again but, if there were another "white" option, I'd choose that instead.

I switched from an upright to the Hoover Canister.  Takes some getting used to moving the unit & hose around.  The vacuum has excellent power, expels clean air, & is quiet.  Only real drawback so far is the  size of the canister but it is very easy to empty.  Would recommend this vacuum to friends.

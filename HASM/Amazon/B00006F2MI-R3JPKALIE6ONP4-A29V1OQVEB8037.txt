Title: Worked great till the grinder broke!
Content:
This machine performed great for about a year and a half then all sorts of things have started going wrong.  The door on the filter often pops open spilling hot coffee everywhere - had to tape it shut!  Then the little rubber stopper on the lid of the grinder broke off so we've got tape over that as well.  Next the grinder has gone "kaput!"  Not sharp anymore leaves huge chunks of beans and sounds like it's about to give out any day now.  Finally it doesn't always finish brewing.  If I put in enough water and beans for a 12 cup pot of coffee the darn thing will stop brewing at 4 cups!  So I have to turn it off and back on to get it to finish - sometimes I've had to do this several times to get one whole pot of coffee.  It's $25 for a replacement grinder via Cuisinart and I'm not sure if I'd rather just spend a little more and get a new machine.  Cuisinart is usually such a reliable name - which is why I didn't hesitate shelling out $149 for this coffee maker.  Have to say that Cuisinart missed the mark on this one!

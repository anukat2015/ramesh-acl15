Title: Never buy acer!!!!!
Content:
I bought an acer aspire 5517 about 2.5 month ago. I actually used it for about a month and a half after it stopped working. I sent it to repair center and I had to pay for it too. Then in about 2.5 weeks I got the computer back. But it still had the same problem, it turned itself off. I called them and now they agree to pay for my shipping.But I won't have my computer for another 2.5 weeks. So if you don't want to deal with all that don't buy acer!!!

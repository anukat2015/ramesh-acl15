Title: Tasted strange
Content:
The only difference between this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker and the one I bought and returned was mine said 5 cups.  It worked perfectly, didn't drip or spill or spit, made 3 1/2 cups of coffee with 5 tbl spoons of coffee to 4 cups water.  But it tasted like plastic.  I tried 5 times to make coffee that tasted like coffee and never did.  Other people had problems with the machine itself, I just couldn't drink the weird tasting stuff that came out of it.

Title: DeLonghi Oil Filled Radiator With Manual Controls
Content:
Heater works very well.  It is almost entirely silent, just occassionally there is the slightest sound as the oil heats up and the metal expands, almost like the sound of oil heating in a fry pan.  There is a slight click whenever the thermostat cycles the heat back on but all heaters do that as far as I know.  There was a strong smell initially but I checked DeLonghi's web page FAQ for oil heaters and it says about 20 hours of use at the high setting is needed to burn off a harmless powder that is used to protect the element while in shipping.  There are a lot of holes punches into all the radiator fins probably to increase the rate of heat transfer to the air.  They look kind of funny compared to other heaters but they obviously work or DeLonghi would not have put them there.

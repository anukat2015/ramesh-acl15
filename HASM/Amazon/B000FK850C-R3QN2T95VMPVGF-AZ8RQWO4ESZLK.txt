Title: Only lasted 1 month
Content:
Bought this heater 1 month ago-2/17 and it doesn't work anymore (today is 3/31).  Only used it on auto at night for the kid's bedroom.  And Amazon.com says it's too late to return it, my window for return expired 3/28.  Sadly, it stopped working on the 28th exactly, I just didn't have the time to check on this until today.  $87 down the potty.

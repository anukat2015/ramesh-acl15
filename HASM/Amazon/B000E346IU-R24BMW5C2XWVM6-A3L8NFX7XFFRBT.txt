Title: I Can SMELL The Heat
Content:
I just purchased this heater and have had it plugged in for about 10 minutes now.  The one thing I can tell you for certain is that this heater SMELLS -- and I don't mean that in a good way.
Some heaters smell of electricity when you turn them on and this one is no exception.  (I'm actually debating right now whether to go turn it off because I truly can't stand how bad it smells!)
Even if this heater could heat my entire home, I think I would return it.  The smell of electricity is very unpleasant -- and probably quite unhealthy too!
EDIT:  After several hours of use, the smell stopped.  This is a decent little heater -- though I think you could find better.  (Check out the Soleus MS-09 -- it's gotten some great reviews so far).  If you are content with an average heater, this one might be right for you.  It operates silently when the fan isn't on.  (As another reviewer mentioned, the "Quick-heat" fan function is basically useless).
Happy shopping!

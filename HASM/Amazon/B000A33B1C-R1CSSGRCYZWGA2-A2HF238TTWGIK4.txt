Title: Great but timer is noisy
Content:
Great heater, very simple, and does the job it's supposed to do. Other reviews explain more in detail, but globally it's not disappointing heating-wise.
BUT... BUT...
If you room is silent, and if you have a tendency to hear "little noises", then you will hear the timer doing "tic-tac-tic-tac...".
I returned the heater after a week because I couldn't sleep with that noise.
NOTE: not all the people will hear it. Again, I'm pretty sensitive to noises.

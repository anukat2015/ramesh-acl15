Title: Excellent machine with a small footprint
Content:
I searched far and wide for a powerful system with small form factor. For the same price with HP or Sony you'd be seeing less powerful processors and less RAM, possibly a smaller hard drive. I was thrilled to find this machine and at a pretty nice price on Amazon I might add! Pay attention to the Front Side Bus speed - it makes a huge difference. I also liked that the computer comes with Bluetooth and the Wireless card supports 802.11N. When it was delivered, it felt so light I wondered if the computer was really in the box.
The switchable graphics is awesome, the machine is plenty fast for what I need and it looks pretty slick.
Few things I don't like are the headphone jack in front and that the "Home and End" keys require one to hit Function. The volume is a low but I'd be connecting the computer to speakers or headphones anyway. Overall very pleased. The glossy screen has not bothered me one bit.
A definite winner in terms of features, power and portability at an affordable price (esp. if you buy it on Amazon...who lowered the price another $40 a few days after I bought it!).

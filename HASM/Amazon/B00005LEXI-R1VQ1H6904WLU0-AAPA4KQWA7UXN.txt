Title: Warm and safe
Content:
Mr. Heater has gotten a lot of flack over the years - but the facts speak - at $85 it sells for only slightly less than its original $100 price tag five years ago - and that's pretty good retention of value for any item nowadays.  
They've come out with a larger version which takes two canisters - however, this version can be run from any size propane tank - though most would want a more powerful heater for a larger space.  Mr. Heater is an excellent piece of gear designed for a specialized purpose - individual heat. It does get quite warm quickly - even around 30 degrees F, after about 20 minutes, I have to turn the dial to the moderate setting (it has two). It's easy starting - and quite easy to clean when the starting mechanism gets sticky (about two years of use under normal conditions - I use the same compressed gas duster with which I clean my computer keyboard).  Comes with clear, easy to follow instructions for accessing any part.  Mr. Heater is well-constructed, durable, and designed for safety.  Obviously, not a back-packing item (for that, the Brinkman portable is best these days {one wishes they'd make a lighter version})- but for home or base-camp use - very light, durable, and just large enough to be very stable, even in a tent.

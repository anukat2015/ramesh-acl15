Title: This vacuum really sucks
Content:
I have had many vacuums (Kirby, Eureka, Filter Queen i.e) But this one is great. I was dusting some light bulbs and the nozzle attached itself and I had to lower the power just to get it off. The bagless feature is wonderful, never saw how much stuff I pick up before. I highly recommend.

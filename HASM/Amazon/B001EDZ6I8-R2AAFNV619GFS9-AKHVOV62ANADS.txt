Title: Bad Smell, Blows Cold Air
Content:
We bought this at Menard's for about $30.00. Upon first use, the product emitted a very strong, noxious odor like burning plastic. We let it run for a while, but it didn't help. The toxic smell was overpowering. Worse, the unit blew cold air! We are returning it to the store for a refund.

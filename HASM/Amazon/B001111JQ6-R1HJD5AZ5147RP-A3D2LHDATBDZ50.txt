Title: Cold coffee
Content:
This coffee maker looked good in the store.  It has a nice design and the thermal pot seemed like a good idea.  Unfortunately it makes terrible coffee and the coffee is cold.  I tried running hot water in the thermal pot before making the coffee and that did not work.  I also tried using the 1-4 cups selection as the instruction manual said that it would run hotter coffee. That did not work either.  There is no heating element in the pad so the coffee will not get warmer over time either.  It was a disappointment.

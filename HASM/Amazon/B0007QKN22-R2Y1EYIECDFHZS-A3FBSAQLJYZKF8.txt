Title: Great Buy
Content:
Just recently purchased this camera to replace my old Canon 35mm SLR which had been sitting in storage for a couple of years since I bought my first digital.
Already having Canon USM lenses I got the body only and am very impressed with the results so far. I can honestly say that the only  photos that haven't come out the way I wanted them to were purely my fault. 
Gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons.
1. I am used to changing the focus from Single to Servo using a dial. Since I change this setting a lot I do not really like having to push buttons to do this.
2. They have made this camera a lot smaller than the 'traditional' Canon SLR. Mostly in the width...I did prefer the larger body size personally.
3. Having to push buttons to change the focus point really does annoy your subjects for portrait shots. (It takes some time) I know I should have bought another camera with Eye focusing if this was an issue for me, but it is just what you get used to I suppose.

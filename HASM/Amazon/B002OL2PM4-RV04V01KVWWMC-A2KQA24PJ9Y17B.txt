Title: Best Device Out By Far.....
Content:
Alright, lets get something straight people. The Archos 5 Android is a product out on the market for the non picky people. If your use to paying a large amount of cash for a device that currently changes every 3 months(Apple), stick with them. The Archos is more for the people who don't expect the world in it. For the more people who are civilize, and dont get caught up on into the "HYPE" of these other bull "BEEP" products. The Archos devices has always been for the more Professional type people, who enjoyed viewing there documents on the go. who elso enjoy the massive storage space for an outstanding price. So for all those critics out there who cant handle the many features cause there mind is use to just handling the basic features of your normal every day MP3 players........... please, give it a rest.
But on the other hand, the Archos 5 Android is SOOOOOOOOO HOT!

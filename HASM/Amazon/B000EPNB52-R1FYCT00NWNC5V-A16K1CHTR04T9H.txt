Title: Poor battery quality - a real bummer
Content:
While it looks functional, unfortunately this little guy has an extremely low battery life - making it practically useless.  I have not yet explored getting this fixed but imagine that once I do, I will end up having paid quite a bit more - ultimately not saving the money that I thought I would.
Too bad!

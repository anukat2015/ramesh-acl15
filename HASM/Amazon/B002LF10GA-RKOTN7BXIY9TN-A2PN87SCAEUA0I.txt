Title: not perfect, but Awsome for the price
Content:
At first use, I noticed that the keys lack beveled edges, making touch typing more difficult.  But it was easy to get used to.
The computer came with many junkware, which I took care of by simply installing XP.  Initially, the driver lacked features such as screen rotate * dimming.  But Acer quickly released updates that fixed everything.  Acer support was also great in helping me finish a broken windows-7 order.  The key worked in other computers.
The 1.4GHz cpu is barely fast enough to decode 1080p videos. However, because the single-core cpu lacks hyperthreading, the computer sometimes stutters when bogged down by a slow thread (e.g., writing to a flash drive).  Lacking HT is definitely a step backward.
The harddrive bay is a tight fit.  I have a WD 500G drive that is fraction thicker, and doesn't fit.  So other upgraders should check the dimensions. 
This little acer has all the essential functions built in.  For the price range and specifications, there's no other competitor in the market that comes close.

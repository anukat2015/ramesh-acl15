Title: Nice AC unit
Content:
We bought this unit last summer to cool our pop-up trailer, and it's done great.  While in Florida over the summer it ran almost 24/7 without problems, and with plenty of air flow.  You do have to drain the reservoir, but it tells you to do so periodically in the manual, so ours never ran over.
When our home a/c went out in May this year (San Antonio!) we ran the unit in our home office upstairs without a problem.  The attachments for venting the unit out of the window worked fine.  We didn't use the little plastic pegs for the window frame, but we didn't need them.  It didn't cool the entire two-story house, but the upstairs was fine.
I would recommend this unit.  I gave it a four because the unit is somewhat heavy - but then it IS an a/c unit!

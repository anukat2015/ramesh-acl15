Title: Consistently good coffee: Produces loads of trash
Content:
It make consistently good coffee, and hot water on tap for making tea. It's very easy to use, and it requires virtually no maintenance. We have one of these in our office, and it's been a solid performer and hassle free. However, one consideration is that every cup of coffee made produces trash - the coffee pod packaging, and for that I deducted 2 stars.
I'd consider having one in my home, save for the trash issue.

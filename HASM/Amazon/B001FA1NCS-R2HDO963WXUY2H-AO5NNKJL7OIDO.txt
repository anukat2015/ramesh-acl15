Title: Apple iPod nano 8 GB Black
Content:
Apple iPod nano 8 GB Black (4th Generation) This is my first player. I love electronic stuff! I'm not that into music these days, but am enjoying the audio books. Also love having all of the digital pictures of grandchildren so handy. I downloaded my favorite movie. How fun is that! It works well. The only thing I do not like is the Itunes store. It isn't as easy to find things as Amazon.com is. I'll probably get used to it eventually. I've had this little gadget for a couple of weeks and it's fun. I investigated different types of players (at stores and online). Once I decided on the iPod, I found that Amazon had the best price.

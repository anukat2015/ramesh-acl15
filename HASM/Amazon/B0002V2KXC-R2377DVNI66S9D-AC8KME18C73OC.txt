Title: Superb heater - nearly silent, classy looking & completely effective
Content:
I've been living in an apartment building owned by a slum landlord since the end of March this year. The building is decent. However, I've been told by the tenants that the landlord provides little to NO HEAT during the cold weather months. I wanted to be sure I was prepared. The Aloha 5120 BTU Home Hearth with Thermostat is classy looking, quickly heats a mid-size bedroom (with high ceilings) and performs nearly silently. Yes, the fire display feature is cool (a little cheesy actually), but I don't use it. It just needlessly burns extra electricity. 
The instructions for this unit contained repeated warnings about how hot the unit gets. I've had the heater on over night and nearly every exposed part of the unit was cold to the touch. The heat is emitted by blowers beneath the unit. The unit has two 750 watt switches. The instructions warned not to use the second switch. I followed this advice initially, but as the weather got colder, I finally had to flip the second 750 watt switch to warm the room sufficiently. I held my breath before flipping the switch, halfway expecting knock power out in the rear of all four apartments on this side of the building. However, not only was there was no calamity, the unit STILL DOES NOT GET HOT and heats superbly. I highly recommend this product (for performance and looks).

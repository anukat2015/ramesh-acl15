Title: Best DSLR I have ever used
Content:
I would have rated it 6 out of 5, but they didnt give me any option to do that. Absolutely amazing DSLR.
Its good for all:
- Beginners who have never even used a DSLR before.
- Professionals who love to shoot the mother nature.
- Mums/Dads who want to capture the best moments of their parenthood. Infact I bought it when my son was born to make sure I capture his early years using the best available camera, and did it paid off or wat..??..
The only minus point that I can think of right now is that "like any other DSLR/SLR" its bulky..so you would have to get used to the fact that you cant carry it like any point2shoot camera in your pocket.. you would need proper bag for carrying this.
- Great battery Life
- Amazing Clarity
- Great speed
- Great Flash for night mode
- Good lense
- Great photography otions/modes.
Great product!!

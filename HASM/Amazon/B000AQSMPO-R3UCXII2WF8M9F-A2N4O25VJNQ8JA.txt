Title: I love my Keurig
Content:
We've had our Keurig for about a month and I couldn't be any happier.  It is so incredibly easy to use.  Before, I would make 6 cups in my regular coffee maker - just in case I wanted more later in the day.  More often than not, I would end up throwing cups away.  What a waste.  Sometimes at night, I would like a cup of coffee, but to rinse out the pot, grind the beans, measure, blah, blah, blah just didn't seem worth it.  With our new Keurig, I can have a cup of coffee in 60 seconds ANYTIME I want it!  No more wasted coffee!  
We also worried about finding the K-Cups locally or if they would be any good.  We've tried several of them and haven't found a bad one in the bunch!  Newman's Own and Tully's are our favorites.  Timothy's is really yummy as well.  Plus, we've ordered online - such a breeze...and Bed, Bath & Beyond stocks several varieties in store for those days when you're running low and have forgotten to order :)
Overall - LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!

Title: Absolutely outstanding
Content:
This vacuum replaces a 25 year old Kirby, and I am amazed at the difference. From Pergo, tile, to carpet, this vacuum conquers them all. I can mop about twice the amount of floor now before having to change mop covers because so much more dirt has been removed. Plus, the dog (who was convinced the old vacuum was the devil) doesn't even bat an eye when we are using the Electrolux because it is very quiet. We have had this vacuum several months and remain very pleased with our purchase. Getting accustomed to the hose head and cannister takes  some patience, but once that is conquered, it is worth working through the learning curve. I highly recommend this vacuum.

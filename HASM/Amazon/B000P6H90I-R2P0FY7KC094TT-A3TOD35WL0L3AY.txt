Title: reasonable
Content:
I used this item intensively for the first 6 months following purchase and then a bit more moderately for the rest of the time. I used it while conducting high impact exercise outdoors. the item was exposed to all kinds of temperature, the rays of the sun and humidity.
The armband broke after about a month of usage.  After about 5 months the paint started to come off.  after about 8 months some of the buttons wouldn't work as well.  But, I continued to use the unit for over a year.  It still works, but most of the buttons don't work well...I think i subconsciously misplaced it, to justify getting the RCA S2501 with the wireless headset.
I got my money's worth, with all the abuse I put it through, plus, I was ready to move on.  Our relationship, RCA 2001, was good while it lasted.  LOL!
Not perfect, but again nothing is, everything breaks eventually, and thank goodness!!!! Cause I definitely also tire of them!

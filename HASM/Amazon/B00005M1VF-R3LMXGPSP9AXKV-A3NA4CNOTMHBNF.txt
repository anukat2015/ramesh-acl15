Title: Very disappointing
Content:
This looked like a good idea for coffee making. It arrived and did not work at all. The switch-button to turn it on is very flimsy and would not turn the machine on. I had to call Amazon (always very cooperative) and pack it all back up and send it back. I would not order this machine again because of the poor design of the on/off button.

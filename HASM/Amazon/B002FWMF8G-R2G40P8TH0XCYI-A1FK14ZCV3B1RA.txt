Title: I love this Frappe Maker! Bye, Bye Starbucks!
Content:
I was so excited to be getting this machine because I am a huge fan of Starbuck's Caramel Frappucinos, but not the price. So, I had high hopes that this would solve my price issue. So, I broke this thing open, washed the necessary parts, and immediately tried it out. At first I couldn't get it to power on, which was my fault. You have got to have the lock on the bottom of the blender part lined up with the arrow on the bottom of the appliance. You won't even see the power light if it's not lined up properly. So, after looking back through the instructions, I realized my mistake and I was on my way. 
I followed the Caramel Cappuccino Frappe recipe in the book provided and I was so pleased with the outcome. It calls for butterscotch-caramel dessert topping (pictured above), which I couldn't initially find, so I used Smucker's caramel topping and that worked great too. It also called for dark roast coffee or espresso, but I just used regular Folgers because I'm not a fan of super strong coffee. This was so delicious! I am NEVER going back to Starbucks and paying almost five dollars for a frappe again. I even put the drink in my Starbuck's tumbler (pictured above) that I purchased from the store. This appliance blends the ice even better than Starbucks. It is just amazing. My husband couldn't believe that I made it when he tried it. We are just so very pleased with this machine and I would recommend it to any frappe fan that is tired of paying those ridiculous prices.

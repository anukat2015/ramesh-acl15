Title: Great alternative for those who can't use window or wall units.
Content:
Over all I am very pleased with my purchase got mine from [...] , the ac works exactly as it should with no problems, a lot quieter than actual wall and window units I have owned in the past, my previous 8,000 btu wall unit did not cool my room at all during that 97 degree heat wave here in New York a week ago so I looked in to a stronger unit and a portable unit. I love the automatic louvers and how they circulate the air to the directions I set it to, this unit dehumidifies very well even in 85% humidity you can feel a very noticeable difference upon walking in my room. The remote control is great as it has a lcd on it which lets me see what I pressed and lets me know the temperature and every thing with out having to get up to look at the unit. 
This unit comes with every thing needed to get it running right out the box, and took about 20 minutes to set up, as soon as you turn the unit on it only takes about 15-20 minutes before you notice that it is cooling and I am very pleased that I can finally cool of in this heat, if your looking for a portable ac with great features, 10,000 btu's and a price tag of $299 then I really suggest buying this unit only cost me $322 plus shipping and taxes after a 20% of coupon. Summer is just getting started so don't torture yourself in this heat...

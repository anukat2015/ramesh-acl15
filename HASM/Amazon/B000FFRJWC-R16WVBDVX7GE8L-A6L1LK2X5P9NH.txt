Title: VERY good vacuum! WORTH WAY MORE THAN IT COSTS
Content:
This is a very good vacuum if you're only doing carpet and not hard surfaces.  i really mean it when i say it's a very good vaccuum.  the person reviewing before complaining about the 3 empties of dust cup is evidence of that.  it's picking up WAY more then other vacuums.  i even tried a dyson out in the store and that was laughable compared to this one.  the dyson left trails of dirt on the home depot floor.  they also said there's no upholstry attachment??? HELLO!!!!!!! the POWER PAW!!!!! DUH!  it's amazing, it rotates just like the regular vacuum so it really gets the cat hair and does a great job on the stairs.  
it has a great ergo handle the lifts and lowers for comfort.
no filter in dust cup which is a huge plus
GREAT PRICE!  worth WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more.
there are a few quirks in design.
hepa air outlet placement, in the front so if you're doing hardwoods and stand it up, things blow around.
the hose is weirdly attached so you really have to push it through the hole to get it to extend and it always goes back in while you're vacuuming.  
the attachments fall off so i just store them elsewhere
the cord should be retractable that would be STELLAR!
i am very happy with this vacuum it does a bang up job and i'll just have to stick to swiffers for my hardwoods.

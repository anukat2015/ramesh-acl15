Title: AWESOME.
Content:
This vacuum completely exceeded my expectations. GREAT purchase! I had pet hear that my lower-cost Bissel was just pushing around on my carpet, it was so embedded in, thanks to having multiple pets.
On the first run, this vacuum got virtually everything up, with ease. The attachments are great, and easy to maneuver around stairs, etc.
I never take the time to make a review, but this REALLY warrants a GREAT one!

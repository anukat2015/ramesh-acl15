Title: Great First Time DSLR Package
Content:
Until now I was one of those people who had never owned an SLR type camera. This being my first SLR I was a little worried about understanding all of the settings that are available. I was pleasantly surprised to see that when using the auto settings it does a very good job at taking pictures equal to or better than my point and shoot. The greatest part about this is that now I can work on learning all of the more advanced features yet still switch back to Auto mode when I need to take a quick picture. So far almost all of the dials and menus are very straight forward. If you are experienced using a point and shoot that was made in the last few years then this camera should be a breeze to pick up and use. I haven't opened the manual yet and I still have managed to play with most of the settings and not render it inoperable. I think this is a very good camera for someone wanting to try their hand at more professional photography. As a side note I noticed this camera got a bad review for not being a Nikon or Canon. I read all the reviews by that person and almost 99% were all 1 or 2 stars so I would take that review with a grain of salt.

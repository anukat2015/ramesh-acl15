Title: Avoid HP products, they don't honor their warranties
Content:
I own this model and have for about 11 months.  I had a problem with the Ethernet port which required it to be sent in to HP for warranty repair.  HP told me it was customer related damage, which it wasn't.  They wanted me to pay $400 to fix the problem.  There is a reason HP is dead last in the customer satisfaction and service according to Consumer Reports.  Avoid HP at all costs, there are much better companies.

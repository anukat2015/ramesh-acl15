Title: Carina Canister Vacuum
Content:
Great vacuum--very light which makes it easy to get a job done as a 5'3" woman who hates to vacuum.  I've had better vacuums in Germany that were similar, but given that the selection of truly light canister vacuums in the US is sparse, this one does just fine.  There are 6 different settings depending on the level of suction, and the attachments worked well for upholstery and crevices.

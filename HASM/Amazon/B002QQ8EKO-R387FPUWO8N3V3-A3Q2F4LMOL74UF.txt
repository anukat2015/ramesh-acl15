Title: Macbook 13 inch great, not sure about Snow Leopard
Content:
Just bought our second Mac for the family (also have a 24" iMac), and we
are very happy with this laptop. The only issue we have encountered is an
issue with DVD and image (.DMG) file access in Snow Leopard, which seems to 
be an OS issue, not specifically related to the Macbook.
I also upgraded the memory from 2GB to 4GB with 3rd party RAM, and that was
easy (once I got the small casing screws out).

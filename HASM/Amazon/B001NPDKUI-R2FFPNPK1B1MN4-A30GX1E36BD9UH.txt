Title: Hassle, hassle, hassle
Content:
I bought this for myself for Christmas and have had nothing but headaches for 6 months.  It repeatedly disabled the internet connection and I had to call repeatedly - so much so I've used the same ticket number for 4 months.  The first time, the technician had me connect it so she could mess with it and she royally screwed up my wifi - taking an hour and a half to do so!  After 5 hours this Sat. and one on Sunday, HP has had me send them the laptop for repair.  I now consider it a very expensive DVD player and will never buy another HP product.

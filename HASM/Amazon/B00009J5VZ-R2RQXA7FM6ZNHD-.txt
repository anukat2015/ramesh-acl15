Title: A Solid Device
Content:
Solid is the word I would use to discribe the 15 GB iPod.  It works as advertised. Further, I have had absolutely no problems using it with my Vaio, which was both a surprise and a relief given all the horror stories I've read about PC users experiencing serious compatablity issues.  The only criticsm I have of Apple (or should I say Musicmatch) is that the media player that is included for PC users could have been a little better.  Its incredibly slow and its "track tagging" feature doesn't always work the way it should (I've tried Ephpod and it works much better/faster than Musicmatch, but I didn't feel like purchasing a full version of MacOpener in order to use it on a permanent basis). Perhaps with Apple's release of iTunes for Windows (which is supposed to happen by years end), my issues with Musicmatch's media player will be cured.The only thing I would suggest to any and all prospective purchasers of the iPod who are also PC users is to check and make sure that your iPod functions properly soon after you purchase it.  CHECK EVERYTHING, ESPECIALLY THE BATTERY.  The battery of the first iPod I bought of this model didn't work.  It wouldn't recharge using the adapter it came with - a common problem.  Luckily, I was smart enough to purchase the service plan that was offered by the store I bought my iPod from.  I brought that iPod back the day after I bought it and the store had to replace it with a new one per the terms of the service plan.Not much of a review, I know.  But like I said, it works as advertised.  If you need to know all the things it can do, just read Amazon's review or go to Apple's web page and read all about it.

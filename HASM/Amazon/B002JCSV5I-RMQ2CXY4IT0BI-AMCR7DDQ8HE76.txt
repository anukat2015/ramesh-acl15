Title: AMAZING Camera
Content:
This is my first DSLR, and it has sparked a passion for photography that was merely an interest before buying this camera.  I have absolutely zero complaints so far (had it for 4 months now).  It might be the perfect entry-level DSLR, and the only problem I have with it is that it makes me want more lenses and an even better Nikon.  Love it.

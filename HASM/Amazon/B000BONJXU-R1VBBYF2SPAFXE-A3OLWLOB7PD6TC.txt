Title: It Sucked
Content:
I wanted something inexpensive for work purposes, when the product was delivered, it looked just fine for what I needed. I put the battery in, and nothing worked. So I went through a bunch of bullcrap. To make a long story short, I payed almost $24.00 to recieve this item,sending it back cost me another $5.00, and they decided to refund me $14.40 for a piece of junk that I never even got to listen to. So all together it cost me $15.00 to write a review for nothing but a hard time. I suggest you don't waste your time on this item, or money.

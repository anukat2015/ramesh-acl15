Title: Couldn't be happier!
Content:
These mini iPods seem pretty expensive for their approx. $250 price tag especially when you know that you can buy one with 15 GB more space for only $50 more. But here's a reason why their so popular! They may have less space but they are also MUCH SMALLER. Lighter and even more portable. I appreciate that for snowboarding.
Plus, the offer below actually works, I got mine for free... I even saw it on the news! They get their iPods from amazon... :)

Enjoy your iPod!

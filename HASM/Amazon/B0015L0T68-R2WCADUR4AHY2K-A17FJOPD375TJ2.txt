Title: Love it!
Content:
I love the SanDisk Fuze. Plenty of space for me for my music with the 4GB but you can also pop in flash card and upgrade it to 8GB.  I imagine you can put a bigger card in there but I bought a 4GB one.  I mainly have used it for music so far and it's easy to use.  I also like the FM radio on it for when walking outdoors.  This was fancy enough for me since I'm not a big MP3 player kind of guy but I really like this unit.  Can't beat it for the price!

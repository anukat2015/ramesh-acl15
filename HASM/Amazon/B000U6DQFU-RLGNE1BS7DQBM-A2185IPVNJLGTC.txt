Title: Do not buy
Content:
With new hardwood floors, I bought the Kurv to vacuum up dust in the corners and piles of dust from sweeping. Whoever engineered this didn't try it themselves.  The fan from the vacuum has been designed to blow on the pile you are trying to vacuum, defeating its purpose.  Also, you cannot set the thing down on a counter or surface... it rolls off.  Brilliance, I tell you!

Title: Works with an external timer
Content:
This heater is exactly what I needed. I've had it for a few days now, and it works perfectly.
I primarily wanted a heater that would work with an external / plug-in / wall timer. You know, the thing with the dial. So many heaters have a "timer" which is actually just one-time automatic shut-off, so you still need to turn it on, and set the timer, each night. I wanted something that would turn on and off at specific times of day, and there aren't many if any.
This heater has three rocker switches for power, heat level, and fan speed; it has a dial for temperature. There are no toggles or digital settings or anything. That means you can cut power to it, then restore power, and it's right back to where you left it -- same temp setting, everything. I have it plugged into a heavy duty timer rated for 1875 watts.
Beyond meeting that specific requirement of mine, this is a great heater. It delivers on its promise of even heating. It circulates the air very well, and automatically adjusts both fan speed and heat output. Much better than heaters that simply cycle. It's also very quiet -- I didn't believe its "whisper-quiet" claims, but it's true.
One step down (VH2) and you lose the automatic fan and heat level ("A" is for automatic). One step up (DVH) and you get digital, which probably won't work on a timer.

Title: My tile floors have never been cleaner
Content:
Between my dog and kids, my kitchen floor never stays clean. I really liked the Bissell Flip-It because for once my floors were truely clean - you should see all the dirt that comes off of the floors versus a mop which just pushes dirty water around. After the first time I used it my husband commented on how clean the floors looked which he had never done before. It is easy to use and would recommend that people buy it.

Title: Best Vacuum Ever!
Content:
I was concerned after some of the reviews, but needed a powerhouse vacuum for dog hair everywhere. This is the one. I have hardwood floors and carpet and it cleaned better than any vacuum I've ever owned. Got all the hair off of our couch, too. I love the attachments tucked into their own little spaces right where I can use them as needed. Researched for cheapest price and this was it; free shipping, no tax:a no-brainer. Had no issues with putting it together, the sound, or being too heavy like others mentioned. My husband is even impressed with it; I'd never pay $500 for a vacuum cleaner, but I don't think you need to with a super vac like this one.

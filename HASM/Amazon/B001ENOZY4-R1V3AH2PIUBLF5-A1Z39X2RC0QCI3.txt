Title: Amazing Camera
Content:
This camera really exeeded my expectations about a DSLR.  This is the first DSLR I own but I've tried several different DSLRs and now stick to Nikon.  D90 rocks!
Lots of customizations, real freedom for creativity on non-auto modes, ease of use, really smart focusing mechanism (11 smart focusing points), cotrols (function and positioning on the body) are designed to help the artist frame, focus and compose the shot the best way.  No words for image quality...
My best purchase ever!

Title: Its a good small heater
Content:
This is a good little heater if you have a small room. I'm actually using this heater at work, where my favorite feature for this product, the thermostat/controller, lets me feel comfortable about walking away from my desk without shutting it off. It'll shut off once it reaches your desirable room temperature. And like most women who work in offices are always cold when the AC is blasting, I would turn on my heater, which doesn't keep me warm and toasty, just keeps me from freezing to death.    This product did not get a 5-stars rating because personally I would like to see this heater give little bit more heat. I guess its hard to combat a full AC cold blast with a little heater (its like having a window open in the winter and trying to heat up the room). However, I would think in a small room where there cold air is not constantly coming in, this heater works well. Good Luck!

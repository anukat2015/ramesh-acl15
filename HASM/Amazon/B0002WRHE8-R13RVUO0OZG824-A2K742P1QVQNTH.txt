Title: Beat the COLD!
Content:
My best friend recommended to me to buy this heater for use when I'm out back giving my Beagles a cleaning after they come in from a hunt. I have a 10 foot by 10 foot shack with water and a hose and after washing them off the heater makes it easier to keep them warm while I dry them off. It also keeps me warm and makes this dirty job as nice as it can be. The dogs also like it because they stand in front of the heater while waiting to get dried. The fan helps move the heat around and I'm sweating by the time I get to the last dog so I turn it down to the medium setting. My dogs and I love this little heater.

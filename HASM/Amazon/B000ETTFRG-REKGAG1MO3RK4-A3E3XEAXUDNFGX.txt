Title: Good product
Content:
I've purchased two Sansas, a 4 GB & this 6 GB model for my late teen boys. Both are operating flawlessly...the smaller version going on 6 months.  Buy the largest GB capacity you can afford if purchasing for someone who is somewhat an avid collector of tunes.  My son filled the 4 GB version amazingly fast--the only complaint that's been lodged.

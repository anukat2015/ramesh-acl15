Title: HP dv6-1361sb
Content:
The HP dv6-1361 is a great overall buy. well suited for the more experienced computer user that requires a more advanced machine for more complex tasks as well as the gamers who like to be mobile. After much searching the laptop was the best suited for my application and budget at the time. I am extremely happy with the purchase. Here are the pros and cons of the system
Pros
Windows 7 Professional 64bit
4 GB DDR3 memory
2.53 Core 2 Duo Processor
1 gb ATI graphics card
Full Keyboard
Bluetooth and WiFi 
15.6" Wide Screen
Cons
6 cell battery life is only gives 1.5 hrs not 3 as advertised. I will recommend the 12 cell high capacity battery as an additional purchase
Antivirus only 60day trial

Title: Hot feet!
Content:
It works as advertised.  The foot warmer setting quickly heats up cold feet in slippers.  It gets so hot after a while that you have to turn it off.
My only complaint is the cost.  It's really just a piece of molded plastic with some heating elements in it.  There's not even that much plastic to it; the back of the plastic foot rest is hollow.

Title: Canon Rebel XT Good Value for money
Content:
I purchased the Rebel XT with reservations regarding its plastic body.  I was worried about scratches and durability.  I've used this camera and find that some of the shots I've taken were far better quality than I've been able to obtain with other digitals, The only exception is my 30 year old Canon SLR.  I like the quality, but find that the lenses will cost about the same as the camera.  Altogether this is a pretty good camera for the cost.  the weight is very light and with some care, this should last quite a few years.  This is good for an intermediate user who'd lilke to move from the traditional SLR to the digital. This camera has room for growth. 
I like it and would recommend it to friends.

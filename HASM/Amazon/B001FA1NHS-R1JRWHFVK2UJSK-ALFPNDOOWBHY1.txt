Title: I love it!
Content:
I have the 4th Generation Ipod Nano in orange. It looks beautiful and it works perfectly. I do wish it would have come with more detailed instructions for setting up as there are alot of options in the menu and the buttons I push that I have no idea what they mean. 
I bought a cover for it to protect it while it's in my purse, but would also recommend some kind of screen cover to cover the glass part from scratches, etc...

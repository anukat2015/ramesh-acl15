Title: Decent heat but not overwhelming
Content:
I purchased this Holmes Quartz heater about a month ago for my wife, who likes a *lot* of heat. She did not find it adequate -- it puts out a decent amount of heat, but it is not "burning" by any means. On a freezing day it does not heat her 12x12 office to 75+ degrees as she likes it. She switched to a heater with a parabolic "satellite dish" to focus the heat directly at her. That parabolic heater does not warm the office either, but it heats up anything right in front of it, to the point of discomfort, which is how she likes it!
I'm not "cold-blooded" like my wife, and I find the Holmes heater quite acceptable. Running it for 15 minutes warms up my 15x15 office for a few hours on a freezing day. The fan is a bit noisy like a typical desktop oscillating fan, but it's just more white noise in the office. The safety features are good, and maybe you'll like the thermostat control, though a simple on/off switch is enough for me.

Title: good vacuum
Content:
We have owned a lot of vacuum cleaners. It seems like we needed a new one every couple years because they keep burning out. Two dogs don't help - that's for sure. Well, after years of complaining we finally bought an Electrolux and it was worth the difference in price. IT really does a great job of pricking up all kinds of goodies off the floor. Now I'm sorry I didn't get one years ago. I hope it lasts...

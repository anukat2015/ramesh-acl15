Title: Durability and Performance
Content:
I think everything to be said about the quality of the camera and its performance has been said already. I've used Nikon cameras for years from a Nikkormat from 1967. Always dependable, always the best quality. As for the D40x, a story: A few weeks ago, I had it with me and through a bad set of events, it was kicked off the back of a scaffolding to land on a concrete floor 8 feet below. I was horrified. However, the only damage to the camera was to one of the prongs that holds the lens to the body. I sent the entire thing in to have it tested and checked for damage. None.
Another small point vs. the Cannon Rebel xTi, the shutter sound is much less obtrusive, but still satisfying. I enjoy pointing this out to a friend with a Cannon when the bird he is photographing flies away and I get the good ten frames.

Title: Excellent!!!
Content:
Better than any other cordless I've used and I've used many! 100% better than the red cordless Electrolux which died in less than a year. Powerful suction for a cordless, glides like a breeze, picks up everything from dog hair to grass to small pieces of dog biscuits. Easy to clean. Just pop out the filter and give it a few bangs in the trash bin. Sleek design. Long handle makes it easy to use for someone over six feet (like my husband) Great Product.

Title: Blu Ray, HDMI, HD, core 2 dou -- WOW ---
Content:
I am a self proclaimed apple fan (not a fanboy) -- as I a have an imac, macbook air, 2 iphones, and too many ipods to mention - and all I can say is that this is a sweet computer - I always keep a pc around b/c I dont like to run parallels or other programs to run on my mac --- and I usually use a netbook just for size.  I saw this at bestbuy (699) and was intrigued.  The specs are awesome and the fact that it has a bluray drive with HDMI out sealed the deal.  So far so good -- it's really fast -- at least compaired to my old sony viao w netbook (I tried the new viao x but that was slow as molasis too - actually took a 15% hit -- 200 bucks - to return it).  It is pretty nice looking -- I kinda dig the texture.  It is really heavy -- I would not use this to carry around all the time (macbook air is much better for that) -- but overall this is a great computer at a great price (sorry amazon - it is cheaper at best buy and not even on sale there)

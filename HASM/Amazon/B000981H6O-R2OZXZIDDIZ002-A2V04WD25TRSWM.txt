Title: Short life span makes this a disposable vacuum
Content:
This vacuum is the reason I am currently browsing Amazon in search of a great cordless vacuum! 
I owned this for about a year when I started noticing that shortly after I turned it on, the power would gradually decrease until it was barely operating. The culprit was a dying battery. 
I was informed, however, by my friendly vacuum dealer that the replacement battery for this vacuum costs nearly as much as the entire vacuum. So...my vacuum ended up in the recycling bin. 
Besides the short battery life I experienced, I found this vacuum to have an especially irritating design: it has vents on the side of the motor box that blow air out. If you are trying to pick up pet hair from the floor, this can create a real challenge, if not an impossible task. I would have to sneak up on the hair most times to try to avoid the air flow blowing it away.

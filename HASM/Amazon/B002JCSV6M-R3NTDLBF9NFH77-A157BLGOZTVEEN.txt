Title: Great Outdoors Camera
Content:
I have been interested in photography since the old film slr days. After graduating from the p&s cameras, I moved to the D60 upon its introduction.  I feel like I mastered that camera and decided to move up.  After much research, I decided on the D300s.
The camera was delivered yesterday.  I ended up staying awake all night playing with the camera. It is heavy and well built, and when you look at it, you know it is a real camera!  When you pick one up, you know it isn't some point & shoot. This camera is a serious piece of equipment. My 18-200 f/3.5 VRII seems to love this camera. AF is super fast, and just "feels right" on the D300s.
Now, there is going to be a big learning curve between me and this camera. As my wife said, "There are a lot of buttons, knobs and stuff" on the camera. Just read the manual.  For my money, this is an excellent camera and am very glad I purchased it.

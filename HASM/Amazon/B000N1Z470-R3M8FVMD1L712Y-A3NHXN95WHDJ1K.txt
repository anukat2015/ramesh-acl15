Title: My husband loves it, I think it's pretty nice too.
Content:
It's lightweight and easily carried from one room to the next.  It heats up a small room within a matter of minutes.  It has a thermometer so it can shut off when it reaches a certain temperature and then kick back on when the temperature gets below the desired temp.  (Or you can choose to set the timer and just have it run constantly for a certain time frame).  It comes with a remote control.  What more could you ask for in a portable heater?  It's a great value.  My husband is amazed at how quiet it is.  I personally think it's a little noisey but I'm extra sensitive to that.  It's nowhere near as noisey as a dishwashing machine or major appliance.  My only complaint is that it wakes me every time it kicks on during the night.  (I'm a REALLY light sleeper.)  I love the warmth but I hate getting a terrible night sleep.  It doesn't wake my husband and he raves about how 'quiet' it is.

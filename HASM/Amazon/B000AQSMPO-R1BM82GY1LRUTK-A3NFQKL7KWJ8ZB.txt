Title: Love the coffee and the customer service
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a gift for Christmas and loved it so much I bought a second one for our lake house. The convenience, selection of coffees available and the quality of coffee I drink every morning have completely cured me of my Starbucks habit, much to my husband's delight. 
The other day I dropped and broke the reservoir for my coffee maker. I called Keurig to ask if I could purchase a replacement reservoir. After verifying the serial number, the said they'd send on right out, free of charge. What a happy surprise!

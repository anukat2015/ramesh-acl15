Title: Good little workhorse
Content:
I actually use this fan in my shed to keep my motorcycle warm and it does a great job for a small area.  My motorcycle won't start if it is below 45 and this is a great way to take the chill off the morning without having to remember to plug in the heater.
It  would be be better if it had an actual thermostat that indicated the temperature instead of a dial that you had to guess the temperature.  But that would probably add to the cost.

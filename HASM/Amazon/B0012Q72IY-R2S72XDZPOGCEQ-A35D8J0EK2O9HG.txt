Title: Great camera for the price
Content:
I was upgrading from a Sony point and shoot digital camera.  Before the Sony, I had a Minolta SLR film camera way back when. I wanted to get back into a SLR.  I would not have considered the Pentax K200D except for the fact that Consumer Reports rated this a best buy. I had also looked at the Canon Xsi and the Nikon D60. They seems flimsy compared to the Pentax. I liked the fact that the K200D has in camera stabilization instead of in the lenses and a dust proof weather resistant body.  Pentax seems to have very high quality lens. The Canon and Nikon I believe both have live view which I did not care for.
I've had the camera for a month and have been very pleased with it. It's easy to use, menus are intuitive.  Some people thought the camera was a bit heavy but I have not found that to be an issue at all - feels solid in my small hands.
The batteries that came with the camera (Energizer Lithiums) only last about 500 shots so I am trying some rechargeables (many people suggest using the Enelops). 
I bought the camera in December and then learned it was no longer being made.  Did that change my decision?  No, I am still happy I made the purchase.  I did not like the newer models because most of them have video which I am not interested in.  
All in all very pleased with purchase!

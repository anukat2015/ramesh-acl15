Title: This Lasko heater is terrible.
Content:
I bought this product based on the reviews on here and because I live in South Florida where we don't have central heating. It worked for about 4-5 weeks and now will not turn on at all. I started to do research and found that this was a common problem with Lasko heaters. I think it might be a problem with the electrical supply which might have also caused the power cord to get dangerously hot. I have hard floors which didn't pose too much of a risk from the heat of the power cord but if you have carpet then I would seriously reconsider. On carpet it seems like it could pose a fire risk. Anyway, this is my first review of a product and because I can't stand cold weather this really upset me that it broke after mild use. Also, to compare, I borrowed a friend's sunbeam space heater and that one was smaller, produced more heat, and the power cord never heated up. The sunbeam wasn't as modern looking as the lasko but when its cold, it doesn't matter what the thing looks like...I paid $50 for a good looking broken piece of ****. Amazon is great, this is just a rant on the Lasko product.

Title: Incredible Value
Content:
This little coffee maker is perfect for people who are the only coffee drinker in the house, live alone, or want the ability to quickly brew just 1 cup of coffee. I've used mine hundreds of times and it is still going strong. The re-usable filter shows no sign of wear and is still working great. The travel mug that comes with the unit is very cheap and not even worth using...but what do you expect for 12 bucks for the entire package? This is an incredible value even after you throw away the crappy travel mug. For best performance: grind your beans fine and brew directly into a coffee mug.
Word of advice: don't cheap out on your coffee grinder. Get a quality grinder brand like Bosch and the grinder will last for many years and the motor will stay strong. If you get a cheap grinder you'll end up replacing it and spending more in the long run. If you want good coffee, you can cheap out on your coffee maker, but not on your grinder or beans.

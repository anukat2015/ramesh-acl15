Title: Most suitable for tea, do not use for coffee - Made in China
Content:
I purchased this item in hopes that I was going to get a percolator made in the great country of Britain.  Unfortunately, it is of British design, but like just about anything with a plug nowadays it's made in China.  I have no doubt that it is wonderful for tea, but it is completely inappropriate for coffee.  The basket is very short, and when the water percolates into the basket, the grinds float up and then out into the coffee.  We were having to strain the coffee, and still ended up with grounds in our cup--a lot of them.
We even attempted to use a paper filter above the grounds, but it still floated grounds up.  It is essentially an 8 cup tea maker.  I would NOT attempt to make coffee in it again.  I have since returned the item to Amazon, thankfully.  We are now using the Farberware 12 cup percolator and it makes coffee quite well.  If you've never tried perc'd coffee, you should.  I cannot drink drip coffee without gagging.
Unfortunately, Farberware's is also made in China.  It appears just about all the coffee percolators are made in China.  Maybe one day we'll learn how to manufacture items in our country again.

Title: Nikon D300 is all I expected and more
Content:
I have had my D300 for about four weeks now and have fallen in love with it. From the 51 point auto focus to the built in editing capability it is a fantastic camera. The combination that I use is the D300 with the Nikon 18-200mm VR lens and it allows me, for the most part, to carry only one lens and still allows me to "get the shot".
The clarity of the LCD, the fast focus, the placement of controls, and of course the 12 megapixel resolution are what serious amateurs and professionsl are looking for in a camera. 
This camera replaced a Leica Vlux-1 that I thought would be my camera going forward. I was so disappointed with the quality of the images that I sold it to get the D300 and I have not been disappointed.
If there is a negative it is the weight of the camera and lens when traveling internationally and doing a lot of walking from tourist site to tourist site. But in fact the weight is necessary to get the quality and stability of the body and its ability to absorb shocks and keep out dust and moisture.
I would recommend the Nikon D300 to anyone who is a serious photographer and is looking for outstanding image quality and flexibility when shooting in the field.

Title: Great Starter dslr Camera
Content:
Even though this is a slightly older model, it is a great starter dslr camera.  I bought this last January as my first dslr camera.  I chose it because it was 10mp unlike other starters which were fewer.  It also had good ratings despite not being as popular as other brands.  What sealed the deal was that it was lighter than a lot of other dslr cameras.  I have not been disappointed.  The pictures I have taken have turned out great using a variety of lenses.  Its menus and features are easy to use and you can switch lenses quickly.  Being small and lightweight, I can take it almost anywhere without it being a strain on my neck and shoulders.  I recommend this camera for anyone moving into the dslr field.

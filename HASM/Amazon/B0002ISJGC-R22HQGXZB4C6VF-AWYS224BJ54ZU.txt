Title: Bad, Bad, Worse than Bad
Content:
Does anyone that owns this product have a problem with pouring from the pot? Either the water going in or the coffee coming out?  I end up with a mess all over the counter; I have to keep a dish towel right there for quick clean ups.  It is absolutely ridiculous! A complete mess.  Whoever heard of a coffee pot that will not pour!  I am taking this product back to the store and NEVER buying a Black & Decker product again!

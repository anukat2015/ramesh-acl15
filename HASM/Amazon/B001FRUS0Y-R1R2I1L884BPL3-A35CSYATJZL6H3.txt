Title: Great Computer Just Horrible Battery
Content:
The computer is great and have had no problem internaly other than the battery. The battery only holds about 30 minutes after a year of college student use. I have looked for replacements and most are over $200 giving me a reason to buy a new computer instead of a brand new battery. I love sony and the style they put into their computers but the battery power makes me secound guess buying another one.
Pros: Very fast for everything I have to do. Easy to navigate and to connect things. Tons of music and videos and bearly half way through filling up the hard drive.
Cons: Battery...

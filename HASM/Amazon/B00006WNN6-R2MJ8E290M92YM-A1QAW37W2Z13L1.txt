Title: It blows  :(
Content:
I wanted something to put under my desk at home since I'm on the computer a lot.  This heater blows out warm air right away, but turns off for no apparent reason, is difficult to figure out and lacks a lot of features.  
There are two dials on it that are impossible to read without picking it up and looking at it closely.  There is no ability to move the direction of the air to blow up or down, left or right.  It just blows one direction.  Also, it seems to use up a lot of electricity and has caused me to run outside to the circuit box several times.  It shuts off whenever it wants to... even if it's still very cold under my desk!  There is no way to make it start up again until it wants to.  
I wish I knew these things before I bought it, because I wouldn't have.  There are better space heaters out there in this price range.

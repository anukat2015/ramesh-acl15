Title: From PC to Macbook - GREAT laptop!
Content:
Like many of the reviews posted here, I am also a converted PC to Mac user now (been using windows since Windows 98 came out).  Just before purchasing my macbook (which is the 2.4 ghz model with 128 gig SSD), I had a Dell Laptop with almost identical specs.  For the PC laptop, within the first day of using it, I got the B.S.O.D. (blue screen of death, aka the blue error screen) 2 times.  After many failed attempts dealing with the cust service (we all know how great Dell C.S. is.. absolutely horrible), I decided to return my Dell laptop and get my first ever macbook.  All I can say is that I've had this laptop for 2 months now and have not had ONE problem with it.  I updated all of the software updates with no problems at all, installed all of my mac programs that I bought with no problems, and pretty much coasted through everything else.  In addition to the problem free experience I've had with this laptop, the programs open up almost instantaneously.  There are no holdups at all and the laptop DOESN'T get hot by just browsing the internet (you guessed it, the Dell laptop got hot just after starting it and use it moderately for 5 minutes).  So, if you're at all curious which Dell laptop I got, it's the studio xps 13, aka M 1340.
So, in conclusion, if you're on the fence about getting a macbook, I HIGHLY recommend jumping over and getting it.  I also highly recommend the solid state drive.  It helps with opening up the programs much faster.  So, what are you waiting for...  Check out what you've been missing!

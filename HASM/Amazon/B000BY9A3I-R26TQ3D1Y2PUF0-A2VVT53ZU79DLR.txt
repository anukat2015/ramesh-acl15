Title: Better description for product would have helped
Content:
I agree with many other reviewers that the product is not described well enough to understand what it does well and what it doesn't do well.
Pros:
- Good on bare floors
- Great waste emptying feature
- Good filter cleaning brush
- Relatively quiet
- Adjustable speed well-placed
- Fairly light weight
Cons:
- Cord is way too short for a house vacuum
- Air-powered vacuum head gets clogged with hair quickly and stops spinning. Very difficult to clean to get it re-started. Basically, this vacuum should be advertised for bare floors
   only.
- Attachments are mounted too low on wand and fall off frequently (fixable)
Some reviewers have noted problems that were obviously manufacturer defects rather than actual problems with a properly-functioning unit (overheating, changing suction speeds when wand is flexed, etc.) Reviews like these should be about how the company responded in terms of full replacement or refund. There was one review like this that was not encouraging as to company response.

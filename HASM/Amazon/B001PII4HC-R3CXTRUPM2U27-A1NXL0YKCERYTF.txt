Title: Wow what great little laptop!
Content:
Pros - A great little laptop that you can fit in your purse or large pocket. Its very easy to use and I installed alot of programs with out any trouble. Even my husband who doesn't like small fine print fell in love with it. Some say it boots up slow but mine always boots in about a minute which is fast enough for me.
Cons - The battery is not 4 hours but only about 2 so buy the extended battery with it to stay in business longer.
Fine Print took a little time to get use to.
Mouse is different but you a just fast to it.
I wish it had more usb ports but you always can buy a device to make more.
No cd rom drive but you can buy it external.
Over all I would diffential buy this computer again. I give it 5 stars!

Frankly I am disappointed, this Toshiba Satellite m505 runs much slower than the other 3 year old laptop that I own of a different brand. In fact the other laptop has a slower processor speed and just 2GB of memory. The reason why I was attracted to this one was due to your claim that the battery will last up 8 hrs, and that is not exactly true. I noticed at full charge it may perform well for just 2 hours. Could it be I have a defective battery? Sad to say no bluetooth. On the other hand the sound system and a lighted keyboard are a plus.

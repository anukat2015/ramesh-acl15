Title: did exactly what I needed
Content:
When our boiler broke, we were stuck using portable electric heating for a little while. We used the HCH4953-U Ultra to keep our large (15x24)living room warm, and it really did well - raised our indoor temperature from 60 to 66/67. It was pretty quiet - you can hear a little air flow, but it's not enough to keep you awake. At night we moved it into our bedroom, and had no problems sleeping. It was perfectly adequate for a large room in autumn in Boston (outdoor temperatures ranged from 30-65), although I don't know how well it would fare in, say, the dead of winter. But, based on my experience, no complaints - we were really comfortable. The thermostat is adjustable, so we could set the temperature to within five degrees, which is fine; for us this was about keeping our house from being really cold, not fine tuning the temperature to within one or two degrees. The heater seemed pretty safe - it didn't seem dangerously hot or anything. And it's small and light and easily portable. All in all, a great product. We have an older, noisier space heater, and we couldn't sleep with it running - this one was a great improvement.

Title: Completely worth every penny
Content:
Apple iPod classic 80 GB Black (6th Generation) OLD MODEL has got to be my favorite portable music,video, and photo device. The reason for me purchasing a iPod classic and not a iTouch is because I have always enjoyed watching movies more than anything else; ofcourse you can watch movies on a iTouch with a larger screen. But the highest amount of GB is about 26 GB on the iTouch.Unlike its predecessors the Apple iPod classic 80 GB Black (6th Generation) OLD MODEL has even greater battery life for watching movies, and will last about all day. Except playing games does lower the battery quicker because it requires more interface, and is just battery consuming. I have only about 25 GB space left over on my iPod.With all the movies, shows, music, pictures, and more. I use this iPod everywhere I go. While on the my way to College or just plugging it to my car. I have not hade any single problems with my iPod and will recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a quality product for your buck. Also purchased the iPod 30 or 80 GB iPod Classic Bundle 15 accessories. Was also worth every penny check it out if your deciding on this product.If you do enjoy movies and do not want to pay about 4.99 for each movie on iTunes. Then you might want to purchase a iPod Video Converter. I recommend Xilisoft Video Converter, but you might need to purchase a registration code. This product will save you in the long run of purchasing movies on iTunes.It will burn DVDs to your iPod in just a little amount of time with no extra payments needed.

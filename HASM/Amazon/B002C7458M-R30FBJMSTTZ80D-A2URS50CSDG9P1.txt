Title: Another Convert
Content:
Didn't take to long.  Long time Dell small laptop user, this 13 inch MacBook Pro just "smokes" the PC in almost every category.  The hardware, cords, and info are just packaged to get running fast and with ease.  Even plugging in the power cord  has a "magnet" type grab from an inch or so out and does not have a top or bottom!, nice, simple, and creative.
I agree with the weight for a small unit, but seemed to get comfortable quickly.  The "one piece construction" could not be any lighter and does give you the feel of a solid, indestructible machine.  CD/DVD player has played all types of movies with good volume if not using ear plugs or head phones.
I thought of buying the 3 year warranty extension but found that way to pricey.  Shall stick to the one year plan and bank on the come.
All In All, first impression mirrors so many others who has switched to a Mac and really been impressed with the style, basic programs, and overall functionally.  I look forward to adding some software in the near future.

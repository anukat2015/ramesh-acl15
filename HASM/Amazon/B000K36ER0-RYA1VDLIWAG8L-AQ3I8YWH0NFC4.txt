Title: Disastrous Design
Content:
First the pause and serve stopped working, arguably the most important feature of a coffeemaker. Then, inexplicably, the water *ALL* leaked out from the bottom just all of a sudden. I've only had this for about 8 months. Trashed it today. For shame, Mr. Coffee, for shame. Products like this are what's wrong with America.

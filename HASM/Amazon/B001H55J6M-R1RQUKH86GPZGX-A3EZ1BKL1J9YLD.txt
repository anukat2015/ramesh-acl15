Title: Absolute stunner
Content:
This one is my 5th or 6th laptop. I have used HP, DELL and original compaq. So this is my first Lenovo and I am blown away by this one to put it in short.
People who complains about Lenovo's looks should shut up (including me). This one is much more good looking laptop than how the photos look. Black, sleek, shiny, sexy and super light. In fact to me it looks better than the white MacBook I have.
Well, this one is definitely not a dumb blonde sort of laptop. It has got some good hardware too. The contrast and vibrancy of the led backlit screen is just awesome. Keyboard feels very comfortable. Did i tell you it has got a full keyboard which is pretty neat considering the screen size. Stays cool after long hours of use. By long hours I mean upto a week. I normally restart my laptops once a week. Fujitsu hard disk with Lenovo protection keeps things secure. I have been using it for about couple of weeks now and have no complaint.
If I have any complain then that wud be for the mouse keys and absence of any media. The mouse left and right click buttons are little clumsy but works just fine. Somehow there is absolutely no media that comes with the package. No driver cd, no restore DVD no software package. nothing at all. However the setups and drivers are present in a separate partition in the hard drive. So this is not a major complaint.
To sum up, if you are looking for a mid-range good quality, light weight, medium performance laptop then this is THE one. Dont think twice.

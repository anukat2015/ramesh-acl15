Title: Attractive but Powerless
Content:
If the rating were based solely on looks, this heater would get 5 stars.  It's a unique and attractive product.  It is also very quiet.  The problems with this heater are:   1. It doesn't put out a lot of heat.  Even on high power and at the highest temperature setting, you can barely feel it if you're sitting more than a couple feet away.  It hasn't warmed any room in our house bigger than the bathroom [although the instructions say not to use it in the bathroom -- and also not to use it in the shower(!!)].   2. The range of oscillation is quite small (even my easy-to-please husband noticed it).   3. As much as we move this heater around, it would be very nice if it came with a handle.  4. Interestingly, the remote for this heater will control our Lasko fan and vice versa.  This can pose a small problem if you have the two near each other.

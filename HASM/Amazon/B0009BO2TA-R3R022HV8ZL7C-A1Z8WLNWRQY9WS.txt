Title: Everything You Need and Nothing You Don't
Content:
I have a vacuum, but I don't like lugging it around when I just want to do some quick vacuuming so I've been keeping my eye out for a canister that will clean but is lightweight and goodlooking.
This does the job and more! Pretty unexpectedly it's more powerful than I thought it would be and I does more than I thought I needed.
:: Adjustable suction for when you want to clean the curtains, not lose them down the tube. But if you need full power, it's there.
:: Attachments that go from cleaning bare floors (well!) and rugs (good!) to cracks and crevices - even the dust that collects on the top of my books.
:: You don't want a vacumm cleaner that blows dust into the air, this one doesn't. The bag keeps the dirt inside it, then three other filters catch the rest.
I'm not sure why reviewers are being so hard on this model. Maybe they're expecting things you can really only get with a cleaner several hundred dollars more. As for comments about atachments falling off, the attachments work fine - just make sure they're fully inserted and you'll be fine. 
P.S. With the amount of suction this canister has, the attachments it offers as well as being lightweight and easy to operate, I use it way more than I ever expected. How's that for a great review?

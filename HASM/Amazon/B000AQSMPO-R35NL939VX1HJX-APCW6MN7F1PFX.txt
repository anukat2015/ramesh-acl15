Title: Very Noisy
Content:
I recently bought the B50 machine.  A few of my friends had them and enjoyed the convenience, hang the extra cost.  Since my husband hasn't been drinking much coffee lately, I decided to treat myself.  The machine is very noisy, making a loud grumbling noise.  I called Keurig and they gave me the run around.  They said noise is because I have it on a hard surface (Silestone); I need to get a large mouse pad to put under it; the noise is normal. I explained that my friends' machines are not noisy.  They said this is the way the machine should sound and that's that.. I had no other choice but to return it to where I had purchased it.  A manufacturer who will not back their product doesn't deserve to have it on the market.  No customer satisfaction guarantee on this expensive machine.

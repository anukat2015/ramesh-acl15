Title: Wonderful Laptop
Content:
I have had this laptop for over a month, and I absolutely love it.  It is a replacement for my Dell Laptop that has decided to move onto greener pastures.  This is my first Toshiba, and I use computers for work all day.  This is a wonderful laptop it has plenty of power thanks to the i7 Intel Processor, which was the main selling point for me.  I needed a laptop that would hold up and be able to handle the Adobe products (Dreamweaver and Photoshop) that I use regularly and so far no issues at all.  The speakers are very good, considering this is a laptop and the speakers are built in.  I LOVE Windows 7 it is SOOOOO much better than Vista!  The Webcam is wonderful and does a very good job as well.  Overall, considering this is a budget priced laptop, when you factor in the i7 chip, 500GB HD, and 4GB DDR3 RAM.  I am very pleased and I without any reservation recommend this product and I would purchase it again if I had to do it over.

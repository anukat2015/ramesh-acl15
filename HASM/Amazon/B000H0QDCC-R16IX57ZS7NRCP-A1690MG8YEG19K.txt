Title: Better than I thought and Almost There
Content:
I originally bought this out of curiosity, thinking I could return it if I didn't like it.  I was intruiged by the wi-fi, and to see what kind of effort MS would put forward.  I bought mine after the first firmware release, so off the bat I didn't experience the software issues that others seem to.  I downloaded the latest from the zune web site (I do this with everything, the CD in the package is almost always dated). Hooked up my Zune and the music synced up.  The user interface on the device is the best out of all the MP3 players I have owned or used in the past, my Creative ZVM and Zen Xtra (own) and Ipod (used but not owned).  The large screen is tops for visibility (my ZVM is clearer but not overwhelmingly)and the up and down and side to side navigation was strange at first but now I love it.  Above all it sounds fantastic, better than the Ipod, and hair better than my Creatives.  Videos transfer with the Zune software easier than my ZVM, never used an Ipod for video, and I don't do a lot of video.
On the down side, I haven't got to play with the Wi-Fi, but I haven't run into anyone I know with one, so sill interested but until it becomes more widespread I will wait.  Even more disappointing to me and this is mainly what cost it a star and keeps me from replacing my Creative Zen Vision M is lack of support for [...] and audio bookmarking.
I like it enough to keep it and I am getting one for my wife, so I will probably end up testing the wi-fi shortly.  I will hope that Audible and MS will address the audio book thing in a firmware update coming soon.  Overall it was a great first shot for MicroSoft, but they shouldn't rest on this.

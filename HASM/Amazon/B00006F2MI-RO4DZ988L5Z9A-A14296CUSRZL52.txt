Title: I really love this useful gift from a friend!
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a gift and I really like it. I personally would not have purchased it for myself because of the high price. The coffee from this machine is really delcious! The thermal carafe feature is also a real plus. I have read some of the other reviews and I noticed that many people don't care for the noise of the grinder...for me, I think of the sound as a welcome sound of morningtime and a reminder that to me that I will soon have freshly ground brewed coffee! Another complaint that I wish to respond to is the "leaking". Personally I have not experienced any leaking. I have brewed coffee twice a day everyday since Christmas and have been really delighted every time. I purchase my beans from Costco (if anyone cares) and I also use regular ground Yuban sometimes if I don't feel like bothering with the beans. I guess I must admit that I don't like the slow pour. The slow pour is tolerable though, since I understand it is like that for a reason (hot coffee sealed inside thermal carafe). One more thing....the coffee maker is really good looking. I have stainless appliances at home and this cuisinart looks fabulous on my countertop. It has a very sexy design. Did I say sexy? Well, it's really nice...I like it.

Title: Bunn Number Three
Content:
This is my 3rd bunn in past 25 years. They make great coffee,fast!!
The only problem with this one is the decanter. It's real messy! Spills water pouring in the pot and coffee pouring in the cup. The other two had different stile decanter, round bottom with a slim neck. Worked great. I'll buy another in 8 to 10 years.

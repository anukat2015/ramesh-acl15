Title: Excellent DSLR for its price
Content:
I bought a Nikon D40 three months ago and returned it. Don't get me wrong, the Nikon D40's imaga quality is exceptional but the AF is a miss. I returned it and got the Canon XSI. The Auto focus was still a miss and I kept getting a "busy" error message even on broad daylight! So I returned it again and finally got the T1i, and am glad I did. This camera's autofocus is pretty fast and, for some reasons, the OS works well on this camera although the XSI has the same lens. The pictures are clear, crisp, and vivid; however, I still think that the Nikon D40 has the best image quality of all three.
This camera is very easy to use, just like the XSI, but this one has faster Autofocus and it works 99% of the time. I don't care much about the video as I do not use it often. Also, the LCD is very bright, and you can actually view it in direct sunlight! Also, Canon lenses are affordable than Nikon's, and there are so wide selection of canon lenses.
In the end, Nikon's IQ is exemplary, and Canon is second. Of course, this is only my non-professional opinion and it is only based on the kit lenses that came with the cameras. I don't think you will ever go wrong with either brand.

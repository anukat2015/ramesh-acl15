Title: Just add talent, and maybe a lens or two
Content:
Great DSLR overall. Invest in a few high end lenses if you want more, but be careful not to blame the camera. The live view LCD has its own sensor, and you have to be careful not to judge the shot by what you see there. Battery life is great. Solid, professional feel, controls, weight, etc. Super camera that will give professional results to the amateur and ease of operation for the pro who can finally start to lighten his(her) bag.

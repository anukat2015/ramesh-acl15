Title: well made laptop
Content:
my first purchase of a laptop. Contains plenty of memory to run your programs smoothly. Using it mainly for school but have been playing some games on it. Experience no lag in the game whatsoever. The wireless internet does not read on the first start sometimes so I have to restart the laptop and it usually works again. May be a compatibility issue with my router (netgear), works fine at a friends house who uses linksys.
webcam is one of the best ive seen. very clear picture
overall good laptop

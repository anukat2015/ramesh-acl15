Title: Do NOT buy!!!  Beware!!!
Content:
I purchased this vacuum cleaner a couple of months ago.  When I first started using it, it worked great.  The vacuum was very powerful and the suction was great.  It cleaned carpets and bare floors with ease.  After using it twice, the light came on indicating that the bag was full.  Although the bag was not completely full, I changed it.  The third time I went to use the vacuum, I noticed that I was having great difficulty picking up dirt.  I then realized that there was absolutely NO suction coming out of the hose.  I checked to see if anything was clogged but it wasn't.  Then all of a sudden, the suction resumed and the vacuum worked again.  The next time I vacuumed, I had the same problem, no suction and no clogs.  The light indicating the bag needed to be changed stayed on all the time even when the bag was new.  I called Hoover's customer support and they told me that sometimes there is a malfunction with the light and that it shouldn't affect the vacuum's performance. I used the vacuum a few more times and constantly had no suction and had to check the hose to see if something was stuck.  There was never a clog so I don't understand why the vacuum just stopped working.  BUYER BEWARE - DO NOT buy this vacuum.  I returned the vacuum for a full refund and will NEVER buy a Hoover vacuum again.

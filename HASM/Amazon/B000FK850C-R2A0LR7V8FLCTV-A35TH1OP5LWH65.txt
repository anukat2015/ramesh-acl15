Title: not so good
Content:
I have found that the electric fan-heaters in general are a weak option for heating needs even in the temperate climate of the Bay Area California. This model in particular has struggled to do any good for me. The oscillation moves much too slow and the fan is just not powerful enough to blow whatever heat the ceramic may create.  It is really only useful in a very small room (say a bathroom or equivalent) when you do not want to heat the WHOLE house. However, it may still take around two or more hours to get a room from 50 to 60 degrees. I would recommend using a parabolic or a more powerful fan model if you are not scared of the increased electric bill that ANY of these little heaters will generate.

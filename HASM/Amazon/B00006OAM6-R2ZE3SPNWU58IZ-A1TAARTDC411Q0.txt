Title: Great heater, not built to last.
Content:
This heater WAS great, but stopped working after only 5 months.  I should have sent it back when I first assembled it.  I noticed the tilt clamp was not only difficult to assemble, but didn't really function well(tilting).  So we basically had to put it on the floor.  We enjoyed the warmth, up to 20 feet away.  I wouldn't buy another one though after it konked out so soon, the tilt quality, and the size as well.

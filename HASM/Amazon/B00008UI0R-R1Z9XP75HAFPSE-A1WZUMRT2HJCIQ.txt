Title: Disappointing over time
Content:
When we first started using this little vacuum we were in awe of its suction. It really gets stuff up. After a year of use we find there are some problems that take away from the machine's appeal.
First: we aren't rigorous housekeepers and we have a big dog that sheds. 
The problems: #1 - throwing the belt. This happens every other time we use the vacuum. It wouldn't be so bad if they made it easy to put the belt back on its shaft - a dedicated hatch, maybe. But you have to loosen four sunken screws on the bottom to take off the top cover. In other words, you loosen the screws and then turn the head over to take off the top and the screws fall out. If you are careful you can avoid the screws falling out but why is it an issue in the first place?
#2 - Capacity.  Once a week, 8x8 rug, dog hair. Empty the canister every time. And it goes over the "full" line at that.
#3 - Falling handle. Don't quite know how else to say it. The carpet head had a detent in it that is supposed to hold the four-foot tube vertical when you need it to. It would work fine if there wasn't a heavy, springy hose attached to it. Whenever you stop you need to place the handle so it is propped up somewhere.
Like I implied, we are not the greatest vacuum testers. But this thing annoys me when I use it. 5 stars for suction, -2 stars for useability.

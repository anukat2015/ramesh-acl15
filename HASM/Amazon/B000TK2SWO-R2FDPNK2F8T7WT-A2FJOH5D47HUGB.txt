Title: Dayton warms things up
Content:
This item arrived with adequate instructions and I had already had the electrical work plumbed in for 240 V, so the installation was a breeze. This was installed in my basement, so that I can work in my woodshop during the winter months.  The heat output is excellent.  I'm not sure of what the monthly increase in electric costs will be, but the ability to use the basement is a plus anyway.  You can adjust the direction of heat flow, heat output and the built-in thermostat allows for shutoff when the desired temperature is obtained and turns on again when needed.  Good item for the price.

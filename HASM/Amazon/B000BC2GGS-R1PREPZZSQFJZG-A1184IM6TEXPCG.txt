Title: Excellent heating for small to mid-large rooms
Content:
The heater worked perfectly right out of the box.  No setup necessary, you just plug it in and it works.  Heats my 12x14 bedroom with ease, and has heated out 16x22 living room with ease as well.  Its wonderful because it is silent but it is also incredibly fast at heating whatever environment its in.  The only downsides to it are its very large footprint and that it doesn't retain the last temperature setting you put in it - you have to set it every time you turn the heater on (its default is 75 F).
If ever I was in need of another heater I would buy another one of these.

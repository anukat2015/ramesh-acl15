Title: Works great!!!!!
Content:
The only cons I have are that iTunes is crappy and that vista and iTunes always run into problems.  I would recommend not upgrading iTunes.
Also, DO NOT download from Amazons mp3 site.  I lost several songs during the download and the music selection is way behind.

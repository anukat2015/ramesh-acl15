Title: The best ever!
Content:
I had this model for a year-to year and a half, then it died unexpectly. I bought a replacement (cheaper) Mr. Coffee and realized how spoiled we have become with the Braun. The coffee tastes SO much better and is much hotter than any other machine I have owned. After a week of Mr. Coffee, I went back to Amazon to see if I could find my old Braun model. There is was! We are so happy and content with it - I don't know what will happen if/when this one dies. It is worth it's weight in gold! (Maybe I should buy another to store away, just in case...)
The absolutely ONLY bad thing about this machine is that I am forever spoiled!!

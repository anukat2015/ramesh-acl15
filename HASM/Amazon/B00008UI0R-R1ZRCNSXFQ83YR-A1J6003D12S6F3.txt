Title: Fantastic
Content:
I purchased this vacuum to replace my 9 month old eureka. It's the best purchase I have made. I wish I would have looked at this Hoover sooner.  The suction on it is everything the description said it would be. It's lightweight makes it easy to go up and down stairs with. So far it hasn't given me any trouble, my eureka has been in the shop 4 times, but my Hoover is going strong. I highly recommend this Hoover Wind Tunnel.  Stay away from eureka products.

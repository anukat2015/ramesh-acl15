Title: very pleasant surpirse
Content:
I wanted a vacuum cleaner for bare floors (one without a rotating beater brush that scatters debris) and this one fit the bill.  When I got it home, I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it performed.  Strong suction, light weight, and ideal for bare floors.  Couple the performance with the low price, and I could not be more pleased.

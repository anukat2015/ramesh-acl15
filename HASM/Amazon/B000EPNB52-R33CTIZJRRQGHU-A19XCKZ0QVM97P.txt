Title: iPod is Awesome
Content:
This is my second iPod. My first was a "mini" which the nano makes look like a "jumbo". It's very lightweight, sound quality is typical of these devices. The battery life is outstanding (again, compared to the mini). I've only had it for a month, but the battery so far is lasting over 8 hours. I haven't completely run it until it is dead yet, so I don't know how long it will really last. Awesome!

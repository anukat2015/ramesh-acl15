Title: Who needs a Mac?
Content:
i ordered this laptop on Amazon when I saw it for sale at $699.00, but then got an email from Amazon telling me they were cancelling my order because of the item's availbility, I got so mad, but then 5 days later I saw it on Best Buy for the same amount, ordered through Bing Cash back and I only hade to pay $22.00 more than on Amazon (including Tax).
So far I love this laptop, very quiet and fast, the keyboard is excellent, even though I am not interested in watching Blue Ray discs on it, it is a plus that made me go for it.
Design is nice too, used the battery with Wi-Fi for an hour and downloaded about 2 Gb of files from internet and I still had an hour or so remaining of battery power.
Very Light, only 6 lb.
And of course, Sony's movie editing software is awsome.
I definately would reccomend it.

Title: Not Hot
Content:
Always, Amazon sends out their products swiftly which we appreciate.  The coffee maker is attractive and easy to use.  If one wants coffee that is not bitter, use a filter along with the one that comes with the machine.  Our only complaint is it does not make the coffee hot enough.  We still have to put our cup in the microwave to bring the temperature up.  We would love to find a machine that makes HOT coffee.

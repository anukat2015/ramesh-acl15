Title: Great Product
Content:
I don't normally give 5 stars to anything but this product deserves it with one minor exepction below. I give it a 4 stars since there is not a 4.5 stars option.
We have owned it for 15 months and have had no real problems with it at all.
With the clear dirt container is easy to see when it needs emptying. The suction is quite adequate and the power head works well. We use it on both hardwood floors and large area rugs. It is easy to pull around. The telescoping wand is a good feature. A concern before the purchase was the effectiveness and durability of the cord retractor. Much to my delight it continues to work well with no problems. The filter is easy to remove, clean and replace. 
The hard surface head has a bit of a funky fit to the wand but there has been no probem with it coming off. It did cause an initial concern. The locking pin for the power head gets pushed in when the hard surface head is attached. Because of this, pet hair got caught under the holding spring for the pin; keeping it from extending all the way out when the power head was attached. This caused the power head to come off when the wand was pulled toward you. At first I thought it was defective but just before I called Hoover to complain I noticed the hair trapped under the spring. Upon removing the hair the pin extended all the way and the power head stayed on the wand with no further issues. 
I definitely recommend this product.

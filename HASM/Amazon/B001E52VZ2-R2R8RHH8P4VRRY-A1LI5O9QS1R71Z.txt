Title: Cleans well but a bit flimsy.
Content:
The Electrolux 3670G Boss Canister Vacuum 12 Amp has a strong motor and creates good suction (which might be even more effective if the narrow hose & wand had a wider diameter to allow easier airflow). Easy to carry while in operation. Nice long hose and wand, and power cord is long enough for small homes and apartments. Noisy but who cares. The machine and all attachments are of thin plastic, so don't let kids stand on the hose or any parts.
Ergonomics are bad: plastic corners that could have been gently rounded are a bit sharp, sometimes uncomfortable to handle. Power-on button on top of machine is small, demands operation with thumb, not foot. Cord winds up manually UNDER the machine, which is tedious but easy and normally keeps the machine from rolling smoothly when cord is wound up. Bags on this model have good capacity, considering it's a lightweight portable. Included "10-inch floor tool" works well on bare floors, okay on low carpets, not so good on thicker carpets or rugs (maybe there's a heavier/wider floor tool available?).

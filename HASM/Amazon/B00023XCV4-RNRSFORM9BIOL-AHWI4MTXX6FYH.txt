Title: user evaluation
Content:
Percolator makes very good coffee and keeps it heated very good.
However, inside the pot, the nut that secures the bottom electrical assembly to the pot is corroding in many spots.  the corrosion is pitts on the surface of the nut. 
Otherwise the percolator functions very well.

Title: BRRRRRR
Content:
I purchased this heater to supplement a new bathroom built onto my home. The room is 16' x 21'and I was skeptical that it would be warm this winter, but with this heater I no longer have that concern.  It keeps this room very cozy; in fact when I first started to use it I set the Comfortemp setting and quickly realized that was just too warm.  I now use just the thermostat and it keeps this room nice and toasty. There are conventional heating vents from the furnace but something extra was needed because of the size.  This heater comes with a terrific price tag and I like the fact that it does not get hot on the outside so as to cause burns if touched. I recommend this if you are looking for a smaller, but functional and inexpensive heater.

Title: Mediocre Heater
Content:
I bought this a month ago during a particularly cold period. Here's what I've noticed so far:
Pros
-Energy efficient. This is nice because it means I can justify leaving it on longer. 
-If it gets bumped, it turns off. I use this on carpet and safety was a concern. 
-The heating settings are nice. You can set it for different temperature settings and when it reaches that temperature, it'll turn off. It's useful for if you want to leave the heater on at night without worrying it'll get too warm.
-The rotating feature is pretty nice. Nothing special about it, but nice.
Cons
-The cord is short. VERY short. You'll ever need to leave this right next to the outlet or get an extension cord.
-It's not that effective. To warm one, small room, I have to make sure all doors that lead to another room are shut and leave this on for a long while. 
As for the noise, it's not loud, but its definitely not silent. You can hear the fan. If you're looking for a silent heater, this isn't for you.
Overall: It's pretty good for the price and it has some nice features, but overall, it's a pretty weak heater. 
UPDATE: After reading the comment, I looked underneath and sure enough, there was more cord. It still isn't that long of a cord but its better than what I thought, so I gave it an extra star!

Title: A great product but no provision for hanging
Content:
I bought this to provide heat to a bird. It's made of metal and has no means to hang on a wall or cage. An adhesive backed velcro style tape is provided but I wasn't interested in sticking that on my wall. The cord comes out of a side so if you divise a method to hang it on your cage, the cord is easily accessible by your bird. My solution was to put it on an art easle very close to the cage but not within reach. The panel is not hot to the touch, but I have not measured the temperature on the perch my bird uses near the heat panel (four or more inches from the panel).

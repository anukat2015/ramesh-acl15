Title: Great price for a great product
Content:
Heats up the room well, easy to use controls.  Heater and/or fan creates a strange low frequency rhythm that might bother some sensitive people a little.  Be careful about using on same circuit as other high amp/volt devices like hair dryers or vacuums.

Title: Great Laptop!
Content:
For the money, you can't beat it. That said, it does have it's minor problems. I don't like the mouse pad all that much and the "eco-utility" had problems from the start. Neither one of these problems are game changers for me though, just simple annoyances. Since I listed the bad points... Here are the good points: The battery life is great, the keyboard is very responsive, the computer is super-sleek, the resolution is awesome, Windows 7 is pretty cool, the computer doesn't weigh much at all, etc. I could name a bunch more, but you get the picture.

Title: Show me the filters
Content:
What good is a bagless/dustless vacuum when replacement filters are nowhere to be found? I've searched the Net far and wide and have turned up empty-handed. You would think that ... would at least stock them as a service to its customers. Also, the design is flawed. The handle to the dirt compartment is positioned right above the handle for carrying the vacuum. Imagine the mess you'll have on your hands when you accidentally unhinge the dirt compartment thinking you're reaching for the carrying handle. Alas, you get what you pay for. Please-- do yourself a favor and pass on this one!

Title: doesn't suck
Content:
It doesn't do a good job sucking up the cat litter from the carpet or the cat hair.  If I'm patient with it, and keep trying, the motor gets too hot and shuts down.  Very very disappointing item.
It's easy to change attachments/empty the receptacle and the filter works well.

Title: Very good.
Content:
A very good mp3 player. It had bigger space and was cheaper that the IPOD. I used it so much that I had to replace the battery and I easily bought a battery on ebay (it was cheap too!). Something you cannot do with an IPOD. Overall a quality unit. A little bit on the bigger side, but it was able to hold my entire music collection. The software that comes with it, makes syncing it easy.

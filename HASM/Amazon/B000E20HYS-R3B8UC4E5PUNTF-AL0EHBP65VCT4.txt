Title: LOVE this machine.
Content:
Pros- Heats super fast and always mixes perfectly, keeps cocoa at a nice hot temperature.  
Cons- some cocoa can burn to bottom, but comes off with soaking and scouring.  Makes cocoa making too easy, you will drink way too much.  Cannot fill to a full 4 cups or will spill over even with lid locked on. 3 cups max.

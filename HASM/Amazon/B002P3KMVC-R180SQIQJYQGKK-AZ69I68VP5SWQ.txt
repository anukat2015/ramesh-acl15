Title: Battery life not what it claims to be
Content:
I purchased this laptop on Thanksgiving week.  It is now end of January.  My laptop (not running anything except Mozilla and Google Desktop, clocking in 5% of CPU usage) is showing 34% battery remaining for an expected 1 hr 54 minutes.  Do your math.  This laptop really has a battery life of 6 hours.
I have another ASUS computer (Eee 1005).  Same battery situation.  
So if you are purchasing this laptop because of the "phenomenal battery power", better think again.
I also would like to see Blue Tooth on this laptop.  It doesn't come with one, and I have to use a mini USB-bluetooth device.  
Otherwise I have no real issue with this laptop.  Yes, it is light.  Screen is too glossy and reflective.

Title: Great But Limited!
Content:
The shuffle is great and compact and works well in conjunction with working out. It's always reliable, and seems to hold a charge for quite some time. On the down side though, you can't see what you want to play (there's no screen), and there are also no commands other than on/off. You also can't organize folders - all types of songs go into one long playlist. At 2gb, it holds a lot, so you may have to go through a LOT of songs to get to the one you want. At the price though, it's almost worthing have separate shuffles for different folders.

Title: Very happy with this camera
Content:
I already have a Canon Elan IIe, but it's time to go digital.  While looking into digital SLR's, I saw that this was the best bang for my buck.  Tons of features and a great price.  When you compare it to its competition, the Nikon D80, the price is a lot better.  It seems that with Nikon, the price gets raised a bit due to its name.  But that doesn't always mean its better.  For my needs, this is great.  It's good enough for a beginner and is more than enough camera if you decide to grow and get more into photography.
My only problem was when I got the camera, it seemed to underexpose pictures.  I literally had to keep the exposure compensation up about a stop or so to get normal looking photos.  I looked online and saw this was a big problem with a lot of people, so I returned the camera and had a new one sent.  The new one is fine and works perfect.  Unfortunately, when I called Canon they denied the problem even though it's all over the web on every forum and review.  But hey, the new camera is fine....must have gotten one of the bad ones.  Maybe they're working on it, who knows.
Also, the kit lens is just OK.  It's a bit slow, but for the price I don't expect a 2.8 or 1.4.  Maybe consider buying the body only and using the extra money for a better lens.
All in all, I'm happy with it!

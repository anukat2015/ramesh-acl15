Title: Way to go Microsoft!
Content:
I'll leave it to others to point out the many advantages of the Zune, and simply say that the fact that this product costs $350 on eBay says something about customer demand for it. I've been trying to get this player ever since it came out, and only succeeded today. (Our local Wal-Mart had two left.)
The bottom line is that there are only three or four significant disadvantages for the Zune compared to the iPod Classic:
1. Battery life - the battery life is the same for video (5 hrs.), but the iPod Classic has 30 hrs. of audio life compared to the Zune's 20.
2. Using it as an external hard drive - This is a reason why many people buy a hard disk player instead of a flash player. I can't understand why Microsoft couldn't allow this.
3. Notes - Notes on the iPod can be very useful. I'll miss this feature the most.
Besides fixing the above problems, my number one recommendation is that the photo sharing feature be expanded to include other devices, especially WiFi-equipped cameras. That way, you could wirelessly unload your camera pictures to your Zune when your camera is full - not to mention being able to start sharing the pictures with other Zune owners immediately.
But the number of ways the Zune bests the Classic should make Apple hang its head. Windows Media Center TV show syncing, wireless syncing, a screen twice as large, beautiful graphical interface, customization (the norm for Microsoft products), magnetic earbuds, updated software...
Finally, would everyone stop comparing the iPod touch to the 80GB Zune? A product that costs $50 more while giving you only one-tenth the storage space is not a comparable product.

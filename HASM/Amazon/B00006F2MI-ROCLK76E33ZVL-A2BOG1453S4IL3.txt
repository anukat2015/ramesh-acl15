Title: Complete Waste of Money
Content:
My wife bought this coffee maker for me from Amazon about two years ago.  Since then, I have been through the original coffee maker plus two warranty replacements from Cuisinart.  Each time, it would seem to work fine for a few months, but then it would start leaking water, then make sparking sounds, and finally it would spew electrical smoke everywhere.  This last time I gave up and tore the thing open.... you can see the results under "customer images" unless Amazon removes them.  
Cheap, dried-out rubber water hoses connected to the resistance heater by cheap clamps result in water being spewed directly onto the exposed electrical connections.  
Why did this same problem occur three times in  a row?  Maybe because I only use it on weekends and the hoses were drying out during the week?  Maybe they sent me two re-furb units as replacements that already had partially dried-out hoses?  Who knows.....  just stay away from this cheaply constructed and poorly engineered waste of money.  Cuisinart should be ashamed of themselves for charging $150.

Title: Great portable laptop with more than enough power
Content:
I had purchased a 10" Asus netbook but I was sick of it after a few hours of squinting at the screen. I just couldnt be productive using it.  I decided I would try again with this laptop and its so much better. Well worth the additional $200. Everything about it is perfect for my needs. Super portable. Good battery life. The cpu was a concern of mine initially but it really has plenty of power. Ive been a mac user for several years now and I have to say that I am pretty impressed with Windows 7 too. Very elegant and has *borrowed* some UI features from OS X. Works for me.

Title: Solid Coffee Maker with Great Carafe
Content:
I had this model under the Black and Decker brand for over 10 years and was very satisfied with it. My favorite point to this coffee maker was the insulated carafe. It kept the coffee hot enough until I finished the pot. It needed no burner to keep on or over-cook the coffee. The carafe's best feature was that it poured out without dribbling all over ( something most all coffee makers fail at ).
When the switch finally did break, I was given a gift of the Cusinart 4-cup cofeemaker with a stainless steel carafe. What a piece of junk it was. The carafe poured more coffee on the couter than the in the cup. Also, the warmer burned the coffee in the carafe ( YUK ). The Cuisinart lasted a few months and then broke ( YEAH - I could get rid of it without insulting the gift giver ). 
I searched Amazon and found this Jerdon model which was the same as the Black and Decker which well-served me so many years. Of course, I bought it. When it arrived I could not have been more exicted - it was like Christmas morning to me.
The only difference from my original was the coffee grounds basket. The original had a cone-shaped basket, with a filter. The cone shaped filter does make a little better flavored coffee, with less grounds ( fortunatly I kept my old one for some reason and use it ).
I highly recommend this pot if you are looking for a small coffee maker.  It works and the price is right. My only dislike is that it's not made in USA.

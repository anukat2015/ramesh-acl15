Title: You Don't Want to Buy This Coffee Maker
Content:
First the good:
--It looks nice sitting on your counter.
--The beeping sound to signify the end of the brewing cycle is nice.
Now the bad:
--You will never get anything but a warm cup of coffee out of this coffee maker.  And if you add milk or cream to your coffee, the result is lukewarm at best.  You will aways have to put your coffee in the microwave.  This is true no matter how close you follow the directions, and no matter how creative you get. Even if you remove the carafe from the unit after the brewing cycle is completed, your coffee will only be warm. The instruction manual says to completely fill the carafe with very hot water and let it sit for 10 minutes before brewing in order to heat up the carafe.  Okay, during the morning rush to get out to work, who has time to let their kitchen faucet run for a few minutes to get hot water (especially in the winter) and then wait for 10 minutes with the water in the carafe and then wait for the brewing cycle to end?  
--The carafe is stainless steel - no glass lining (which is the best insulation material)  Not sure who the genius is that thinks stainless steel is an insulator.
--The Pause-and-serve mechanism broke on the third day.  I went to pull out the carafe to grab a cup and coffee came splashing down all over my hand.
--This isn't a huge deal but the clock is so bright I'm fairly certain it could serve as a beacon to guide large ships sailing past rocky coast lines.

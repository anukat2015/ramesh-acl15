Title: Good hardware, poor software
Content:
I was excited to have an alternative to the iPod, but this is a poor designed product. 
1) It syncs only half the time. My new Dell XPS system detects the Zune, but the Zune software doesn't. After rebooting it'll work. I updated the firmware, software etc, still nothing. 
2) The Zune Marketplace software is looks simple, but it's slow to repond. I found albums dissapearing from my library for no reson. Adding files is very slow, and deleting songs and video is from the Zune doesn't work.
3) All videos must be converted and this s VERY SLOW. No drag/drop.
4) The Wifi feature is a joke. Not once have I used this feature because nobody has a Zune to share with. 
5) No bookmarks for Audiobooks.
6) Doesn't sound as crisp as the iPod. I listened to the same track side by side and the Zune highs are muffled. 
7) EQ doesn't EQ. It's either sizzle and boom or flat.

Title: 7 hr battery? Not so
Content:
I bought this because it's supposed to have a 7 hr battery. It dies around 3-4 hrs. All I run is the internet (browsing, not playing music or videos) and MS WORD. I also have an Acer Aspire One which does last 5 hrs like it says. I think the screen size (more than double) is eating up the energy (I do keep the setting on bright, it's not worth eye strain to save energy).
I still gave it 4 starts because I haven't had any problems with it. It's easy to type on & has a full # pad. I can shut it down with a bunch of browsers tabs open and when I re-start those tabs will open right back up where they were.
The Harmon Karmon speakers are better than average for a laptop & the sound goes to a decent level unlike some laptops.
The glossy black is beautiful and does get fingerprints easy, but they are also easy to just wipe off!
Lastly, if you're going to buy online, I recommend Amazon as their customer service is 2nd to none!

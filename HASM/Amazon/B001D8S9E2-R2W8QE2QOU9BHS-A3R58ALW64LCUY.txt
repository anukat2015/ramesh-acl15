Title: Super cool Macbook
Content:
What can I tell the world about this Macbook..hmmm
I have wanted to get a macbook for ages but never had the money, but I finally got it and have not regretted selling my Toshiba Satellite. The Macbook is indeed the real deal and feels like a real notebook; it is very light, slick, fast and just a beauty to look at.. an amazing piece of technology...
Pros
- It is very light and much faster on Vista than my Toshiba. (I use parallels virtual machine)
- It works very well with the iphone... syncing my iphone with iCal, Address book and iPhoto is too easy compared to working on windows..
- The unibody design is awesome, a smooth architecture which i have no complaints about.
- You cant see the speakers but they sound good. a friend has the previous macbook version but this one sounds much better.
- Mac has built in sensors for adjusting to different light conditions and its brilliant.
- Your iphone headset works on the MB like on the iPhone, it pauses music in itunes, quicktime and skips to next song etc.. mac technicians are really good..
- The computer is very intuitive. i cannot get my hand off the touchpad, had an external mouse but cant do the gestures with it so i only use the trackpad instead... four, three, two finger gestures are just BRILLIANT... This touchpad works exactly like my iphone and makes switching windows and SPACES a breeze...pich pictures to enlarge or shrink and make text larger in Safari.
- You may have heard everyone talk about the screen, yes it is really nice under the right conditions, pictures look nice and bright indoors.
Cons
- The screen has a crazzy glare when used outdoors, the sun will totally spoil the fun.. you have to make sure you stay away from direct sunlight... Obviously you get this with other glossy screen laptops.. even my toshiba had this glare...
- Definitely wish it had the firewire, that totally sucks
- The battery life when i run it on wifi and surfing net, playing music etc was shy of the 5 hours mac had previously advertised..came to about 4 hours which is not 5 but still pretty cool.
No more windows notebooks for me, from now on its Mac!!!

Title: Good Purchase. Heats up big room quickly.
Content:
Moved into a new place that didn't have central heating, got rather cold at night and in the morning so I searched for an electric heater. Never bought one before, but I came across this one and purchased it. Very happy with the purchase, it is dead silent, heats a rather large bedroom well and keeps it warm through the night so I am not freezing in the morning.  Has great options, you can leave it on and just constantly running or set it at a certain temperature and it will turn it self off when it reaches that temp. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a reliable, silent heater for a decent sized room.

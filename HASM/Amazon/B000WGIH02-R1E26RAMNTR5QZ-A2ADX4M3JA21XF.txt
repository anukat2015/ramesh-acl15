Title: Great item and great price
Content:
I bought the P2 about a week ago and it is great. I got it primarily to watch tv shows and movies on it and I am very happy. The sound is great and the video quality is outstanding. Here are some good things about each feature from what I have seen.
-The touch screen is great because there are not a lot of buttons to get dirt or dust into. So if I spill something (which I have not yet) or get finger prints on it, simply wipe it off. The buttons it has on the sides are convenient for adjusting volume and using play/pause without distracting from what you are watching, though you can do the same functions by touching the screen.
-TIP-There is a hold button so you do not press any buttons nor touch features by mistake. Out of the box, when hold is used, you cannot adjust volume nor pause even with the side buttons, BUT within the settings you DO have the option to operate just the side buttons while on hold. 
-Audio sounds crisp and clean. The radio signal is clean and sounds good. The sound quality is only limited to the quality of whatever music/video you put on the device. I have not used the supplied ear buds yet, but I have used the HP ones from my laptop and the audio is awesome. The bass alone is outstanding, so movies are a good experience.
- Among other settings you can change the menu style to any of the templates on the P2, and you can also download many many more and even make your own using the emodio software. 
-IMPORTANT- Out of the box the supplied software is buggy, and extensive research confirmed that it was in fact the software and not me. If you have trouble with the supplied software in the box, go to emodio.com and download the Emodio software. It looks the same as the one that comes with the P2, and works perfectly. 
-The P2 stores pictures so you can use it as a photo album. The "finger slide" time between images is a bit slow but not a concern to me. I think I can wait the 1/2 second it takes to shift between them lol.
- The video capacity is decent and determined by the settings you choose for each video. There are various settings before transfering a video over to determine how good it will looks, such as bit rate, frame rate, and overall quality. This will take tweaking to get the quality that is best for you. I found a happy middle that looks good for me and allows for more storage on the device.
-Out of the box the P2 does not have a lot in terms of content, which you will see. You get the good stuff when updating the firmware, including games, subway maps, and blue tooth capability, and a few more. All very useful.
- Bluetooth. This is cool because it is possible. I do not have much use for that feature, but again I mainly got it for watching videos. You can transfer files from your cell phone to the P2, provided your cell have Bluetooth as well. You can also use the P2, through the phone, to make a call.
**This really serves no purpose to me because while you can connect to your cell, & even dial out on the p2, and use it rather than hold the phone to your ear, you still have to hold the P2 up to your mouth to speak into the mic. it is cool if you are laying down, or otherwise close to the P2's mic, but I don't use it myself. 
That about covers it for what I have used and what I know about it so far. If you are wanting wifi or to watch live tv, etc I would go with an ipod touch. However I have no need for that and I am happy with what I have.
Overall I totally recommend this little gadget to anyone looking to listen to crisp clear audio or good looking video on the go, or otherwise away from household devices. The only drawback I can think of is also a good thing. The touch screen is very sensitive, so you don't have to apply much pressure at all. I can't stress how literal that statement is. The only down side to that is if you don't have the hold button on, and you barely swipe it by accident, you can click out of whatever you're watching/hearing. Other than that, yeah...go get it =)

Title: Awesome!
Content:
This thing is wonderful! Has great suction and picks up stuff I did not even know was there. Love the on-board tools!
The 3 things I do not like:  1. Its pretty heavy. 2. The crevice tool is difficult to replace after you have finished using it. 3. The instructions for assembly are not at all clear.
Other than these, I am very happy with my choice.

Title: Small, powerful, but pricey!
Content:
I considered many PC options, Toshiba, MAC, Samsung, Acer, Dell and Sony.  At the end of the day, the Toshiba, while very dependable and my current workhorse of 4 years, Toshiba has annoying function popups, the unit latch is broken and the power button will not turn off unless I push down with substantial force.  The Macs, too pricey and didn't offer the features I needed in business.  Acer, did not care for the layout although the features were impressive. Samsung, I really wanted the X360P but the price was never be lowered over 6 months.  Dell, had that experience once before, Support was comical and frustrating.  So, Sony it was.  A little pricey but with the size, power and features I needed in my work, it was my choice.  I'm in the process of removing many of the annoying Sony software so that I can work without sales pitches and quirky helful notes.

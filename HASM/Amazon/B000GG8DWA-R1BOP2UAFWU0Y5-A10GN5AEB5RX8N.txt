Title: Quartz Heater
Content:
This heater puts out a really hot, instant heat. It reminds you a bit
of a sunlamp, intense direct heat. It is great for "spot" heating but
is not meant to heat up a room, as it heats objects and not air.
This product does what it was intended to do and is an excellent preformer
and not all that bad on the electric bill.

Title: I really, really wanted this vacuum to work
Content:
I really wanted this vacuum to work, but I ended up sending it back because of its abysmal performance on a very low-piled carpet.  This model only had mediocre performance on the concrete floors in my unit and it fared even worse on the newly installed Interface FLOR (Modern Mix) carpet tiles; the vacuum's suction would barely pick up fuzz and pile remnants stuck to the face of the carpet.  
I was also disappointed by the unit's cheap-looking components.  The components seemed like something from a dollar store; the plastic may have been durable, but the appearance, design, and feel seemed cheap.  The only pros to this vacuum are its small form, the canister's aesthetics, and it's refreshingly quiet noise level.
I would definitely not buy this vacuum again, and I would have great difficulty trying out a different Bosch vacuum after this experience.

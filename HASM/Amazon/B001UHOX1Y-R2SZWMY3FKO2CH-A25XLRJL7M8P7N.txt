Title: too hot, bad touch pad, no PGUP/PGDN
Content:
I bought this computer to finish a book. It was adequate but has several things I don't like:
1.  runs very hot
2.  poor touch pad; way too much drag
3.  no dedicated pageup/pagedn keys; this is something I continue to miss
4.  heat outlet on front left; when I use FN/Arrow up or Arrow Down, my hand is   
    hit all the time by the hot air.
5.  awfully slow startup running VISTA (even when in sleep mode)
I'm returning to Toshiba, which I like a lot better....

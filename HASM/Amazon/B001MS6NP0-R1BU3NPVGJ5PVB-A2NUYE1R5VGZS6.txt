Title: Cooler fan noise
Content:
I bought one Sony Vaio VGN-CS115D on OCT 2008 and after four months of use it started to make a noise that became worst and worst. Now I am having a problem with the cooler fan and I have to buy one new, because I am not on Canada and how is difficult to find the spare fan. I called Sony phone and lost a lot of time until I got the wright sector. Now I am waiting the new cooler fan as it is supposed to arrive just on 3 weeks.
After 1 week of waiting the coolerfan arrived, it was exactly the spare part I needed, so the problem was solved.
Bu I will keep my classification because it is a mechanical problem that happened in lass than 1 year.

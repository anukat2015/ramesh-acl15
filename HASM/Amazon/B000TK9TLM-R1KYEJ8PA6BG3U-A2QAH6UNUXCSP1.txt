Title: Helped preserve my carpet during a winter crisis
Content:
I ordered the unit on a Tuesday using ship next day as I needed a space heater to help me dry out an area where ice damage had breached my home's wall.
When it arrived, I had the unit on NON-STOP 24/7 for a week while I exchanged towels during the day to keep my carpet dry, but depended on the unit to keep up the vigilance while I slept.
The little unit did its job and even afterward when the daytime temperatures remained below freezing for another two weeks, I used it to complement my heat pump.
It did very well, by raising the temp of my open Living Room by nearly 5° and my entire first floor (~500SF)by roughly 4° (based on differences between my programmable thermostat setting and actual temperature)
It is fairly quiet, insomuchas it sits about 6' away from my TV and with the TV on, you can only hear it when it is in oscillating mode.
I am very pleased with its performance and would definitely recommend this to anyone who had a small home or space to warm up.
(and kudos to Amazon for immediately refunding the shipping charges when it did not arrive on the day it was guaranteed as I had paid extra for overnight shipping.)

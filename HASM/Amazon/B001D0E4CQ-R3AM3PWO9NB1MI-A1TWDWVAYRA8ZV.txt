Title: Beautifull!!!!!!!
Content:
I decided to buy this as an upgrade to my Archos 605 (160 gig). I figured I'd keep one in my car & use as an mp3 player & take the other to work to watch movies at lunch. The differences: The 505 right off the bat has a much clearer picture, touch response screen is more sensitive, sound is about the same, internet - much faster!!!!! Not really using it for internet access, but definately faster. Most important: IF YOU WANT TO TRANSFER MOVIES / CD'S WITHOUT PAYING ARCHOS FOR EVERY LITTLE UPGRADE, PLS DO YOUR RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AS THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS AVAILABLE THAT WILL ALLOY YOU HASTLE FREE TRANSFER W/ NO PROBLEMS!!!!!

Title: ibiza needs improvement
Content:
ibiza it's just ok. I had several problems with it. First the sound needs to be improved. I was never able to use wireless internet because of connection problems. Writing text is time consuming. To use it wirelessly at home, you have to have expensive wi-fi wireless connection and that's not a good deal.I was never able to make it work when Wi-fi was available.It took me a while before I had it replaced as the operators will suggest ideas to fix it. These ideas did not work, but wasted a lot of my time. The front pad gets stucked, and then the options run wildly up and down making it very diffcult to make a selection. When I asked for help, the operators are not familiar with the device, but they try very hard to be helpful. Ibiza has a short battery life-span not recommended for trips longer than 6 hours unless you purchase a car charger.Ibiza is a good idea because it is compact, it is actually much cheaper than a cd library collection,  downloading out of your home is possible (needs improvement), it is available with a 30 GB memory, and you have tons of music without having to purchase individual songs. Download times are rather fast and that is great.

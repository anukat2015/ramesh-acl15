Title: Good first half of DIGITAL photography
Content:
I've had the camera about a month now, taking many, many, many pictures of my children, my daughter's fifth birthday, etc. I look forward to getting outside when it dries up out there, but this camera has performed great. Combine it with something good that will handle the .NEF files (or just shoot .JPG), and the world is your oyster. Great camera, would buy again.

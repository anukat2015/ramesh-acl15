Title: Nikon D40 Camera Kit
Content:
The camera has many features that a newbie to SLR cameras will have to master.  However, you can take the camera out of the box and shot just like a point-and-shoot without missing a beat.  The fast shutter speed helps catch those moments when children are moving at break neck speed and your point-and-shoot is still focusing.  A great starter SLR.

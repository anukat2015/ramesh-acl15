Title: Awesome Personal Media Player
Content:
Have had the new Zen xfi 32 for about a week. I absolutely love it! The display is crisp and clear. Navigation is straightforward and simple. The sound quality is very good, although like others I find that the Crystalizer does tend to make some pieces sound a bit tinny. The built in speaker is surprisingly loud and distortion free for its size. Earbuds are better than average quality. I already have a pair of UEs, so these are a nice extra. Pictures and video are amazingly sharp and vivid.
The xfi housing and navigation buttons are so much nicer than the previous Zen. The unit has a quality feel to it that was lacking in the plastic housed version.
I tend to prefer single purpose tech toys rather than combo devices. My cell phone is a phone. My digital camera is a camera, etc. Again, like others, I have no interest in the wifi capabilities, fm, or other bells and whistles, so I haven't played with those.
What I wanted was a really extraordinary PMP (never an iPod) and I got it.
My only complaint is that I like to create playlists where the songs play in a particular order. They kind of have a flow to them. I have not found a way to do that yet, so if anyone figures it out, please be so kind as to post here. Allegedly, the songs play in the order you add them to the list but I have found that is not necessarily the case.

Title: For what its worth
Content:
I choose the UL20 as my next laptop mid-April 2010 thinking I had bought my next all around mobile machine. In general I agree with the positive comments here about it but sorry to say, I no longer own it. After about 10 days the hard drive failed (of course at a point of critical need no less) outright. I'm around enough technology all the time not to get too 'upset' about it, things do fail, but after having spent the necessary burn in time getting the machine setup to my preferences, installing and authorizing software, removing unnecessary software, etc. I was a bit disappointed to say the least. I've used many, many Asus Motherboards and other products with great success in the past (CUSI-FX anyone?) so was a bit surprise to end up here.
When it worked, I liked the overall form factor (thin, light), speed (sometimes a bit of a delay - HD issue?), keyboard feel, battery life, price. 
As others have said, I didn't like (hated?) the touch pad or the sensitivity of the buttons (too hard to press). Unlike other touch pads I've used, without a border or edge, it was too easy to move your finger off the pad and have to re-orient or look at the touch pad to 'recover' where your mouse is and resume moving it. While I'm not happy to have wasted my time with the machine and have it fail, in some ways I'm a bit relieved that I won't have to use this touch pad any longer -- simply too disruptive to my productivity.

Title: Superb coffeemaker
Content:
I am delighted with this coffeemaker. The decanter is designed so that coffee doesn't drip or dribble out of the pot as you pour. This is important to me, because I had an ongoing problem with that on the Mr. Coffee coffeemaker I had before. It was a real pain having to wipe up messes every time I poured a coffee with that one. Not the case at all with this one. Also, the Cuisanart gets coffee very hot for a homestyle unit, which surprised and please me. I also like the handy feature of being able to set the auto shutoff -- up to 4 hours. 
The only two features that I don't care for are minor, in my view. As others have noted, the clock has no lighting. That seems odd, and makes the clock unreadable in the dark. But since I have other lighted clocks in my kitchen, it's not a big deal. Also, the hole you pour the water in is small, so you have little room for error. But it's not that hard to do, so again, the advantages and superb performance of this coffeemaker outweigh the trivial negatives. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this same coffeemaker again.

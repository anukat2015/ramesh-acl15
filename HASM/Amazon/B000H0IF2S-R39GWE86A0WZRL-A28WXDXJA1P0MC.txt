Title: Love it!
Content:
I love my shuffle! I like how you don't have to listen to the songs shuffled if you don't want and I love the clip feature. 250 songs is just right for me. This little baby is perfect for exercising or when you're on the go and you don't want to worry where you'll put it like the full sized iPods. I'm PO'd I bought mine before Apple decided to come out with colored shuffles. Not cool Apple. Not cool. :) The only drawback I've noticed is it doesn't have the option where you push a button and it makes it so if the dial is pressed on accident the song or volume can't be changed. 
EDIT: I found out it does have the hold mode, you hold down the play button for 3 seconds. Awesome!

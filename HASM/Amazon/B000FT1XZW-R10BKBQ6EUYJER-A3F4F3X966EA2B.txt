Title: Portable radiators for comfort and efficiency
Content:
I purchased two portable oil filled radiators as a member of my family used two last year to warm rooms without warming the whole house.  Even with high electrical rates (150% the national average), the cost of radiant electric heat equals the heat of $4.00/gal heating oil. Thus, as the cost of oil remains over $4/gal this makes the electric heat more economical and efficient.
The radiators arived in perfect, new condition and work as advertised.  I'm very pleased with them.

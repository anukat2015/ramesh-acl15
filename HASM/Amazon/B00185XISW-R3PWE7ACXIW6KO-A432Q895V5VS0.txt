Title: Does Not Work - Severely Over Priced wall ornament - Heat Radius 3 ft Max
Content:
Forget using this to heat any size room larger than a very tiny 3x5 bathroom.  Running 2 of these 24 hours a day in a 9x10 room only raised temp 2 degrees.  Not Green as they do not provide adequate heat for energy used.  You are better off buying a less expensive heater that uses somewhat more electricity but provides substantially more heat output.  I have since purchased a SoleusAir Micathermic Flat Panel Heater at less than 1/2 the price of one of these, but it puts out at least twice the heat than two of these "Eco-heaters" combined using about the same amount of electricity (976 watts vs 800 watts).  The Micathermic Flat Panel raised the room temperature fast and can be wall mounted or rolled around on included wheels.  Not so with the "Eco-heater" which can only be wall mounted and does not provide any heat more than 3 feet from the device.  Lets just say you have been warned about the pitfalls of the "Eco-heater" and if you buy it, you will come to regret that decision because it will not live up to the hype.

Title: Heavy and not easy to use
Content:
I bought this vacuum because I thought it is quiet and light. In fact the carpet brush is very heavy and loud, it is difficult to get to the corners. It looks good and has rather good suction but it defenately is not what I call money well spent. I was looking to get Miele Luna which I used before and I should have done it. Overall it's not your favorite vacuum and I would never get it as a gift.

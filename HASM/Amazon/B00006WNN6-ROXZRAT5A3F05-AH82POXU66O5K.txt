Title: DeLonghi DFH132 SafeHeat Fan Heater
Content:
DeLonghi DFH132 SafeHeat Fan Heater - excellent purchase.  Works great. Does exactly what the advertisement said it would.  Works off of a pretty accurate thermostat for a little space heater.  Keeps the temperature just right.  Completely safe, no parts inside that light up.  This is the only type of space heater that we consider safe.  Does not get hot on the outside.  No parts to burn yourself on.  We plan on purchasing a couple of more of the same safe heaters for our other rooms.
Thank you for making a safe space heater that works so well.

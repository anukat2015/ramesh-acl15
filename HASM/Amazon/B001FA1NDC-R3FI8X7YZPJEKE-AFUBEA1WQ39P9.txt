Title: ipod nan0 8gb review - an honest opinion
Content:
The pros are it's small and simple to use. The cons are that it's not really as "big" space wise as you may think. The head phones are very average...but with a quick upgrade to Bose - you really hear the difference. The "stock" headphones don't stay in your ears well if you are doing anything physical at all. All things said and done...spend a few more $$$ and get the bigger hard drive.

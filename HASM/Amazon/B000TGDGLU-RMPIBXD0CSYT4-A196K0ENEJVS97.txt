Title: Not satisfied with this heater.
Content:
I was looking to purchase a silent/simple space heater to keep my bedroom toasty at night in my 14 x 12 bedroom. I thought this heater would do the trick after reading SO many positive reviews on amazon, but this simply wasn't the case. The heater arrived and I excitedly opened the package and began to heat my frigid bedroom. The other reviewers that mentioned the smell were right on, the thing stinks for several hours so I left it in the basement to burn off whatever chemical(s) it was treated with. After it passed the smell test, I put it in my bedroom and switched it on for the night. I'm a somewhat sensitive sleeper, so I instantly noticed a high pitched "buzz" coming from the heater that was slightly irritating. Also, when the heater is "self-adjusting" the temperature, it will continually make a loud click (sometimes multiple clicks within a period of a few minutes). The sound was loud enough to warrant a startle reaction. Last night, on the low setting, I was awakened by a loud buzz from the heater. I awoke, turned off the heater, and today it's being sent back to amazon. I will try a different brand. It earned one star because it did heat the room, but lost 4 stars due to the rickety performance.

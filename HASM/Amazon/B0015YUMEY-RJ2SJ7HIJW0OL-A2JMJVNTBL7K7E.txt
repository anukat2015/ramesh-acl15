Title: Almost a perfect laptop...
Content:
Almost a perfect laptop....
I owned 4 IBM laptops prior to this Macbook Pro 15, 2.4GHz, 2GB Ram,160GB HD.
I used my Thinkpad X series for 3 years and finally it is now experiencing random blue screen of death (due to faulty aged motherboard or memory modules), which I am reluctant to buy replacement parts or repair (old 1.8GHz Centrino).
This is my second Mac (I bought an iMac 20" one year ago and really love it).  I've had this MBP for 3 weeks now.  The first unit I got had a faulty number "2" key on the keyboard.  I had it replaced and the store gave me a brand new one right after testing it.  He said it rarely happens for a mac to have faulty keyboard.  I bought the MBP right after the Leopard was released, hoping the Leopard would come preinstalled.  But it came with Tiger instead and has a drop in kit in the box.  It took me over 2 hours to upgrade to Leopard.
I won't take time to do what others have done; I'll briefly just go over some of the features I hope it could improve/should have included.  Let's face it, it is a $2500 retail laptop, it should come with a lot of features not found on a sub $1000 laptop computer:
1. louder speaker (louder and better low end sound) (some Toshiba and HP has much better sound than the MBP)
2. even though I probably won't use it, but a finger print security scanner would be nice
3. more USB ports (I think it has room for at least 2 more)
4. better cooling, it gets so hot after a while it became not laptop-able.
5. longer battery life (it gets about 3.5-4 hours now.  With the technology improvements on other aspects of the computer industry, I think it should be at least 5-6 hour range for even DVD movie playing.)
6. higher megapixel for the built-in camera. (it's only 2.0MP now)
7. upgrade option for 512M video card (it's only 256M now)
One week after I bought it, Apple offered the option to upgrade to 2.6GHz for another $250.  I didn't think the 0.2GHz was worth $250 so I didn't go back to the store to get it exchanged again.
I play a lot of music on my MBP that's why I really thought the speaker quality was not good enough.  Of course one could always add another external PC speaker, but I am just comparing to what I heard on other Toshiba or HP laptops in the same size/price range.
Overall:  Highly recommended.

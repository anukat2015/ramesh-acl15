Title: Bunn Home Coffee Brewer
Content:
I have used Bunn cofee makers for years and this was to replace one that I had used for about 15 years. It is every bit as good as the old one was but with some nice additional features. I would recommend it to any one looking to either add or replace a coffee maker. It makes excellent coffee in just a few minutes, no waiting for the water to heat and then go through a ten to fifteen minute cycle prior to having fresh coffee ready. If you will note this is the coffee maker used by the majority of restaurants and nearly everyone loves their coffee.

Title: Perfect so far
Content:
Can't complain about anything right now.
One big MAJOR change from my previous laptop is that this new one does not trigger the breaker of the power plug in a plane (i fly a LOT for work). On my previous laptop (gateway),  as soon as i started a 3d game,   the breaker was shutting off the power.  Now it don't. Amazing !

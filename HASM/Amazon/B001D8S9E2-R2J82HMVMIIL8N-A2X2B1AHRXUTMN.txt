Title: Great, except for under boot camp (Windows)
Content:
Overall, I really like the new MacBook.  Great construction quality and great software included.  The new graphics are a really nice improvement over previous MacBooks.
My only complaints are with using it with Windows (under Boot camp).  The trackpad is completely unusable and the sound drivers cut out a lot.  Also, there seems to be a bit of vibration from the hard-drive that is noticeable when the computer is on my lap.

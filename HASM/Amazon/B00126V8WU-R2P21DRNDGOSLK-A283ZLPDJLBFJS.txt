Title: DON"T BUY THE SANSA CLIP!
Content:
What a rip-off!  The little plastic clip broke within a couple of months.  I called their "customer service" and they promised me a one-time replacement, free of charge, five months ago.  Despite repeated contacts, they have never delivered.  Then they reversed course, claiming the plastic clip was an "accessory" (never mind that the product is called a Sansa CLIP) and saying that it wasn't covered under warranty.  They are telling me to purchase a pack of three clips for $15, which is a significant percentage of the original purchase price.  Don't buy from these rip-off artists!

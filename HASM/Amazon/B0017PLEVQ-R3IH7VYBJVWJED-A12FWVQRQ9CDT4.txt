Title: Miele Great Motor not so great accessories
Content:
Pros
* Cleans well
* Extremely quiet and pets tolerate it better than most
*When you turn it on, the motor gradually revs up. Automatic suction also protects the motor from getting burned out if something gets clogged in the nozzel. Great variable height and speed.
Cons,
* Crevice tool is too short (compared to Kenmore or other cheaper models)
* Floor brush, attaches clumsily to the side while not in use
* Top of the canister tends to scratch easily so don't use it in the garage
* Brushes have to be cranked 'just so' to fit into the canister
* After 6mo the 'bag full' indicator always indicates that the bag needs changing. Give me a break! 
* Hose does not swivel well
Summary. For $1K, somewhat disappointing. Great motor...but the accessories that are needed to do heavy duty cleaning are sadly lacking. 
The company needs to improve on the details. Outdo the competition on the accessories by adding an LED light to the bare floor brush. Accessories should fit easily into the canister. A 2' longer cord would be nice.
If you want to sell more,fix the details!

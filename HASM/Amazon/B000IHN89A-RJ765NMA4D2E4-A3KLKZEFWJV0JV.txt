Title: Pentax K10D problem
Content:
I truly wish more on line retailers would use the US Mail to deliver.  98% of my packages arrive within 3 days and the price is quite competitive i believe. I would even be happy to pay a FEW dollars more for this.  This provider uses DHL which takes 10 days or so to deliver...and offers a 2 or 3 day delivery for a LOT more money.
The camera worked perfectly, taking stunning photographs for 2 days and then froze-up.  The return process involved the provider sending me a DHL return label via DHL (10 more days) vs e-mailing it, the return via DHL (10 more days) and they assure me that the replacement is on it's way but as it's only been 5 days since they sent it I still have almost a week to wait.
I didn't look for user performance reviews of this camera before purchasing it...shame on me.

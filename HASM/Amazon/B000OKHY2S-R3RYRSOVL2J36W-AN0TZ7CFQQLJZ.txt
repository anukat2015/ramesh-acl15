Title: IT'S COOL
Content:
This product works very well if you follow the directions, use the advice offered by some other reviewers here (like proper water and ice mixture, leave a window open, and don't use in a humid climate), and if you only use it for a smaller room. It does what it claims to do. It's a fan that blows ice cold humid air. It cools a 150 sq. ft. area of my house by about ten degrees, but I put other plain fans around it to help stir that cool air around. My only problem is that it's a bit of a pain to take so much stuff apart to clean it and that it goes through water a bit faster than I thought. It's well worth the money, but if you have a larger area, you need a more powerful machine.

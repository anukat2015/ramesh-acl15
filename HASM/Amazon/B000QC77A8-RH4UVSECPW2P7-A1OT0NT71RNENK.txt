Title: Great heater
Content:
This is a great heater and works every bit as well as the model it replaced. I am using it to heat an open area including the living room, kitchen, and hallway and it has worked fine when the indoor temperature was at 58 degrees. It takes a while for it to start bring up the temp (30 to 60 minutes) We have not gotten the evere cold yet but I'm guessing that this heater will need to be supplemented by our central heat but should reduce how much of that will be needed. definitely worth the money. Note: I now live outside of Elko, NV where the winter temps can get to -20.

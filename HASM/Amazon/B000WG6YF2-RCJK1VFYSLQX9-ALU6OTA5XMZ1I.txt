Title: big disappointment
Content:
Zune 8 GB Video MP3 Player (Blue) I ordered this with the car pack for myself. The first one Amazon sent me had an earphone plug that required the plug to be half-way out of the socket and was directional. I was sent a replacement Zune right away, and was very happy with it. However, now that a few weeks have passed, the Zune has completely quit working. It only functions when it is plugged into my computer. I've recharged the batteries, but the buttons no longer work and it is completely dead without being plugged into my computer. I already have a media player on my computer, so this makes the Zune  useless. Doesn't work in the car without working on its own...so I am returning the whole package to Amazon.

Title: A great save.
Content:
For the first month or so, this vaccuum has really done the job well and we greatly prefer this bagless version and the oversized wheels. The only bad thing about this vaccuum is it is a little on the heavy side, and some of the add-ons could be better designed. For the price, I this is actually a very good deal for the power and options, and does a lot of things well that only a much more expensive vaccuum would do.

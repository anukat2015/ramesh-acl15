Title: Great job, the first 2 times
Content:
I've had a Bissell that was given to me. It's been a long time since I've been vacuum shopping. This is like the journey that never ends. We went into Walmart and saw the Infinity for about $155. Our budget was set at $200 and we thought this would be great.
When I got home I looked up reviews on this one and they weren't great at all. I hadn't even opened the box when I considered taking it back because of the bad reviews that I'd seen. Against my initial thoughts, I decided to open the box and give it a shot. After all, some of the reviews were great.
My first impression after assembly was that the handle was wobbly. It was quite annoying. Again, I decided to overlook that and see how it handled.  The real test was using it on my carpet in my office. The carpet is an ivory and I have a dog with black fur. Just imagine how bad this carpet looked with black hair in it. When I first went over the carpet I wished I had a camera handy. The before and after was astonishing! You couldn't even tell there was dog hair in the carpet. It was amazing!!! It goes without saying that I had to clean the canister out with all that this sucker picked up. The second time I used it, still a good job but not quite the same as the first. After the second time it was down hill from there. After 10 days it wasn't even picking up the carpet deodorizer I had sprinkled on the floor. I checked the vacuum to make sure that it was cleaned. It was. I definitely could not overlook the lack of suction. We returned it and now I have no vacuum. The search is back on and I'm tired of looking at them. 
I gave this vacuum a generous 3 stars because initially it did a fabulous job.

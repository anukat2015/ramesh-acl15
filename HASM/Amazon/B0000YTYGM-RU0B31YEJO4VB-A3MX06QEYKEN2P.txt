Title: Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Coffee maker
Content:
So far, my favorite thermal programmable coffer maker and I have had many. This is my second one. The big plus in this coffee maker is the thermal carafe. It is the only one that I have tried (I have owned at least ten) that will keep your coffee hot and fresh for an extended period of time. Besides that, it makes a good cup of coffee. This is the only model that has this particular design carafe. In my opinion, a big mistake. This unit comes in only a twelve cup version and is very tall. I had to remove the rubber pads on the bottom to fit under my cabinets. No big deal. The carafe has a pour through lid without having to unscrew it. When upright the lid seals. This  in part is what helps in keeping your coffee hot and fresh. According to Cuisinart this is also the downside for some owners. The lid has a type of ball valve float which will gum up or stick after continued use without cleaning. This is the fault of the customers who feel it is too much trouble to run some white vinegar and water through their coffee maker or are ignorant and don't take the time to read the cleaning instructions. A big step up for this coffee maker would be for Cuisinart to redesign it to include a cleaning mode button with an alert when cleaning is necessary. It would also be nice to include a water filter and removable water reservoir. A ten cup model would also be appreciated, but keep the carafe design. It's winner.

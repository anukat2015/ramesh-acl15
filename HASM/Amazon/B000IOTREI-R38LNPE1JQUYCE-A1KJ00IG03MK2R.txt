Title: A good heater but with some design flaw.
Content:
The heater is very good at warming up a small area, like if you put it near your sofa when you and your family watching TV together.  Every around that area should feel warm enough.
The heater comes with a safety alarm system.  The alarm will be activated when the heater is about to be tipped over.
What I don't like about this heater is its lack of a handle at the back of the unit like those handles that you will find on most other heaters or room fans.  A very simple and stupid design mistake.  You can't move it around until it is turned off and cooled down completely, or unless you are wearing heat insulated gloves.
The heater comes with a footlight. The footlight is dim enough not to wake you from sleeping but bright enough to prevent you walk right into it by accident.  But there is no way to turn off the footlight unless you remove the bulb inside, which is another design fault.
Despite its fault, I would still recommend this heater for its cheap price and its efficient heating performance.

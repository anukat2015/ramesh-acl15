Title: D40 is the best DSLR for the money!
Content:
I bought my D40 as an upgrade to a D50, which was my first DSLR. The D40 lacks a few features the D50 had. Most important the D40 can't focus early (Non-AF-S version) lenses. Also the D40 lacks of a top status window and dedicated buttons for ISO and White Balance found on the older D50. Obviously Nikon was trying to keep cost down and build a lighter and smaller camera. They have succeeded! The compromises are generally over come by the camera excellent image quality, robust (fast!) performance and ease of use. In all these regards it is a better camera then the older D50, which was a ground breaking entry level DSLR. 
What I like Best:
1>	Auto ISO works great (once you figure out how to turn it on in Program Mode) Picture at ISO 1600 are very usable.
2>	Nice LCD display. Big upgrade from my D50! Picture in review mode are very easy to see and edit. The LCD's integrate information display easily makes up for a lack of a top status window and with a push of a couple buttons you can quickly change most setting.
3>	Very powerful Internal Flash and excellent AF lamp. No red eye! Nikon's TTL metering with a flash is the best in the business and the D40 also sync up to 1/500 of a sec for excellent fill flash in bright condition.
4>	Highly customizable menu system and excellent in camera editing functions. The color balance filter with color histograms is an unbelievable feature to find on a entry level camera.
5>	Price vs. value, easily the best deal in a DSLR out their today.
What I like least:
1>	As with the D50 the Matrix Meter on this generation of consumer Nikons tends to overexpose most of the time. This can be adjusted by turning exposure compensation to -0.7.
2>	My D50's Auto White Balance could never adjust to indoor incandescent lighting without a flash and the D40 still has this flaw. You can of course adjust it manually, but this is still a big problem for a camera intended for the point-n-shot crowd.
3>	The D40 is noticeably smaller and lighter than the D50 and in many ways this is a good thing, but I am still struggling to get use to the smaller grip of the D40. I loved the grip on the D50! The D40's small grip isn't a problem with the complementary 18-55mm kit lens, which weights almost nothing. But the D40 seems a little hard to handle when I mount larger zoom lenses.
Daytona 500 Update:
After writing this review I took my D40 to the Daytona 500. Using a Nikkor 18-200MM I was able to take some of the best pictures of my life. The burst rate of the camera was a little slow, but at 1/1000 of a second I was still able to catch many great shots of the Sprint Cup cars zipping by. As would be expected, freezing the action became increasingly difficult as the sun began to set. Then it occurred to me that the camera flash syncs at 1/500 of a second. I set ISO at 1600, set shutter priority to 1/500 and popped up the onboard flash. I was able to get a very nice shot of Ryan Newman and Kurt Bush coming to the checkered flag, even though they were going 185 MPH and I was over 100 feet away from the track. 
No way your going to find a better digital camera for the price!

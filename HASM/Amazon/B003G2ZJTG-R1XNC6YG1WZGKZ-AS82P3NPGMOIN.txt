Title: New Macbook Pro 2010 Model.
Content:
Honestly, this is absolutely wonderful. I was waiting for this model to be released since January, and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out. I'm just really happy that I waited to buy, because this thing kicks a$$! Still pretty pricey, but I've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund, and finally got to use it. Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel. If you can afford a new laptop, and are in the market for one, of course, then definitely go for this. Great overall. Screen is a bit glossy, but that's not too bad.

Title: Love it!!
Content:
This is great!! I have no idea how much money it's saving me or not, but I love that I no longer have to even worry about the temperature -- it automatically goes where I want it. I read a review about a guy who had to start over in programming it because he shocked it and erased everything: Well, the same thing happened to me. I now know to touch a doorknob first if I'm wearing slippers. That's the only problem. Otherwise it's simple. I definitely would not spend more for a different brand-- this is a great deal!

Title: Average experience
Content:
Was totally hyped up and pre-ordered this notebook before it even came out. Unfortunately there were several drawbacks that made me ultimately return it. 
1. The keyboard key's kept jamming and making unnatural sounds.
2. The deal breaker was here. My hard drive wouldn't stop making noises no matter what I did. It was very noticeable and loud compared to all my previous notebooks.
3. Whenever I lifted up the notebook, it would suddenly start whining.
4. The limited display view was also somewhat of a disappointment.
Despite the faults, I was still fairly impressed with the notebook and had asked for a replacement. 
Unfortunately, the replacement I received had a dead pixel right in the middle so I ended up asking for a complete refund.
Great service from Amazon as usual, but buying from Asus again is very iffy for me.

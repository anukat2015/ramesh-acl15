Title: wonderful but to much power?
Content:
Well the thing worked great.  Boy did it really add some heat to the room.  How ever i used it for o i say about 20 - 30 min at work and it blew the fuse of my room and two offices next to me!! not good at all.  i would not say it is the heaters fault all though my office building is not old or anything.  But if you are sure you wont blow the fust then this heater is the one for you!!

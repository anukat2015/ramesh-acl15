Title: Amazing lap for the price
Content:
This lap is an incredible bargain. I changed my old Dell D610 (intel centrino) and so far this lap flies with the i5 processor. The startup is fast, about 15 seconds, and shut down takes about 7 seconds. Perhaps the only complain will be battery life (2.5 hrs). Oh well, about the color, as someone else said, it doesn't bother me since i never see it while i am using it.

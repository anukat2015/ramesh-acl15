Title: Quiet, fan-less, warms up immediately
Content:
I don't know what's special about HQH355-U, but I can tell you the Holmes HQH355 that I have looks the same and IS fan-less. It also has a 4 hour timer that's activated whenever you turn the power on, but you can deactivate the timer with a simple button push. I'm very happy with it, quiet and it warms up immediately.
I mainly use it in my bathroom when I cut my hair without wearing anything. My wife turns it on while making up. Very convenient, the heat comes up immediately and no worry about forgetting turning it off.
I disconnected one of the two quartz, so it works with only one quartz at 500W instead of 1000W (there is no 500/1000W switch on the HQH355). No temperature control, but this might be a good thing as the quartz makes a loud noise when it is lightening on from cold status. Kmart stores are selling them for $45.
I gave it 4 stars only because a 500w/1000w switch should be there as it has two quartz and the timer should be 1 hour or, even better, 1 and 4 selectable.
Update: I returned this one and bought a SoleusAir MS-11. It is totally quiet, the quartz do not make any noise while lightening up, unlike this Holmes. So I can add an inline thermal control to it, about $10 from Homedepot. It has a 800/400W switch and a switch to turn on/off the oscillator (which is also very quiet). No fan inside. I feel more heat from it even it is 200W less than this Holmes. Even at 400W, both quartz are on, just at lower lightness.

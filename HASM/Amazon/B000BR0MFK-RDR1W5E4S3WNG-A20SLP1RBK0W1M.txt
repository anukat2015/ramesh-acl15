Title: Ipod nano video 8 GB
Content:
I have been fan of the iPods, this is my 4 th one. The product works well. has crisp video and sound. battery life is reasonable, especially in music mode. Works well with iTunes despite my gripes with the software digital rights management. Make sure that you have backup of your own CD's, especially if you are using multiple PC's

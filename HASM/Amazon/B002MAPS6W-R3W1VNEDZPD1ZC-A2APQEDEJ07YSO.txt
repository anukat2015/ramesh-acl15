Title: Nothing beats it - period
Content:
The first gen clip was awesome. But it did have a few niggles for myself. Mainly, I had to build playlists by using folders, but could not see the folders. So sometimes, the playlists go corrupt and I got nothing to play. This one shows folders! And you can play whatever is in there. It has a great battery life, custom EQ, excellent sound output, the OLED display does show lines, but you really have to look for them. I have not even used the FM or the voice recorder features yet. In the past I have used ipods, creative zen players, and this easily outshines them all (although the zen had better playlists options - but I hated the user interface). I had to buy this after I dropped my first gen in a restaurant and "it walked out". Oddly, someone left the skin behind and took only the player. I was easily able to copy my backed up music over to this one. It is very light, can clip on anything, but you may need better head phones.

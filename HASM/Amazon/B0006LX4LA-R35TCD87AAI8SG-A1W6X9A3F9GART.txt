Title: We drink the coffee quickly...so any negatives are mitigated.
Content:
There are two of us who use this coffeemaker.  The coffee is very hot initially...but keeping the coffee hot on the "warmer" is not an issue as we finish it rapidly. The coffee is good flavor and we are fairly well satisfied.
However...it is impossible to tell how much coffee is in the carafe unless you take off the cover and take a peek (who is up to that the first thing in the morning?).  If there is coffee in the carafe and you start another pot...you are in for a spill all over your counter.
Care must be taken when pouring the first cup...CAREFUL it could spill because of the  small removavable plastic cover on the pour spout of the carafe. When initially pouring water into the pot...a hole in the back at the maximum fill level will prevent over-filling...but, overfill with water and you have a spill.
Over all...the coffee that is made is good and hot (but we drink it quickly..."after any spills are cleaned up". Never the less...the above mentioned "negatives" are more an avoidable nuisance than they are a problem.  
Would we purchase again?  Very likely as it is compact, seeming well constructed and the brewed coffee is very good.

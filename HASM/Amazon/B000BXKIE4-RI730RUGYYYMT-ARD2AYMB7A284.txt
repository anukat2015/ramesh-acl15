Title: Disappointing
Content:
The canister is lightweight, quite powerful and reasonably quiet. BUT the power nozzle is heavy, noisy and turns in only one direction. The power nozzle also is self-propelled and takes the person vacuuming on a speed race around the carpet.
The floor brush is wide and makes for quick cleaning of wide expanses of floor. BUT, it is so wide as to be awkward getting into corners and around furniture.
The telescoping wand is convenient. Storage of two of the tools on the handle is not; the tools keep falling off.
The power cord is short.
The hose is too flexible; it kinks easily. 
I would prefer to have the on/off button on the handle of the cleaner not the cannister.
I have had this not even a week, and already I am disappointed in both the design and the materials used in construction.
Added three days after the intial review:
The crevice brush is not long enough to reach in many common crevices, such as those in a car or under a refrigerator.
The prongs of the plug had to be separated a bit so the plug does not fall out of the wall socket.

Title: Casio EX-FH20
Content:
This camera is slightly hard to find. But is a very respectible point and shoot, if that's how you want to use it.  The controls are standard Casio and function well. The only weak area is the 20x zoom.  A little shaky without support and the picutes are not of steller quality.  Otherwise, a very good camera.

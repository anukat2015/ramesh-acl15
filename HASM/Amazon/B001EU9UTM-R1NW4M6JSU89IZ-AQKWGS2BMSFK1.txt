Title: Very Happy With This Espresso/Cappuccino Maker
Content:
This is a lot of machine for the money.  I was using the Mr. Coffee Modern Steam Espresso/Cappuccino Maker - ECM250 and they would last almost a year.  This is a real step up for not much more money.  I make a cappuccino every morning and need a reliable machine.  It is much faster than a steam espresso machine and the other plus is not having to release the pressure after you use it.  The large water reservoir is nice too.  If you make espresso and cappuccino often, I recommend this machine.

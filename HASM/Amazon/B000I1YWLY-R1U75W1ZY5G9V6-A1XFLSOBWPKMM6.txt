Title: A piece of garbage
Content:
I took a chance on this vacuum after reading the mixed reviews.  Big mistake.  Within the first couple of weeks, it only worked when it felt like it.  After 3 trips to the Electrolux warranty center (45 minutes away), *I* finally figured out that it was a connection issue where the hose meets the canister and where the powerhead attaches to the hose.  Yes, both places.  The warranty center told me nothing was wrong because it worked for them perfectly on cue.  I contacted Electrolux and demanded that they send me to a new powerhead and hose.  Then it worked well for a few months.  Now the connection issues are starting again, and the retractable cord no longer works.  I'm ready to throw it in the garbage.  I'll never buy another Electrolux product again.

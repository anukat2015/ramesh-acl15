Title: Great user interface
Content:
Wonderful user interface and dj mode makes this player a jewel to operate. Ripping dvds and compressing to an .avi file size is time-consuming, but within a few days you can store some of your fav. movies for replay anytime.
Only downside is the manual is underwhelming, but the online forums for the anti-ipod crowd are growing. You can quickly grab neat navigation tips by just searching the forums. The included software works well, and is fairly easy to use - still, it is not as user friendly as iTunes. The tradeoff is the open architecture.

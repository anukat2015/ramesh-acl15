Title: Great Starter Camera!
Content:
OK, so I'm not a professional photographer (not for lack of desire or talent, mind you!).  I'm actually very much the novice when it comes to camera equipment, but I'm learning.  I've had one form of camera or another since the age of 7, though, and I know what I like.
I got my Evolt 500 kit from my husband, Christmas 2007.  This is my first GOOD camera and I'm wondering how I ever got along without it!  I love the image quality I'm getting.  I love the ease of use.  I love the feel of it and, as I saw someone else write, the very satisfying sound of the shutter-click!
I realize I still have much to learn about cameras and all of the bells and whistles that go with them, but I would absolutely recommend this camera to other beginning, aspiring photographers.  I'm having a blast with it!  By all means, this baby gets Five-plus stars from me.

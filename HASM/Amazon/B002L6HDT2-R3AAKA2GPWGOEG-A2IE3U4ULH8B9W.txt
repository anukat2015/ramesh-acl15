Title: Outstanding!
Content:
It's amazing what this little guy does for the price. I've had iPods in the past, but never a Nano. The camera feature is neat, but I think the best thing might be the radio. I love the fact that you can save songs that you hear on the radio and then download them from iTunes later. Haven't used the pedometer or stopwatch features yet but what a great idea. This little guy has everything! This Nano is great! Small, light and easy to use with tons of options... and the price is very reasonable!

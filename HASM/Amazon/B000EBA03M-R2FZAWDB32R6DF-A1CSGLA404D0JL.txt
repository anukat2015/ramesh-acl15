Title: Olympus for Christmas
Content:
So far I am very happy with this camera!
It is easy to use & easy to take great pictures.
I have used it many times, since getting it!
The only thing that would have been nice would have been for it to have had some kind of memory card in the package. 
Upon opening it on Christmas morning, of coarse you want to use it right away to capture the occasion.
Especially since there is no internal memory.
Over all Great Camera, Great Package (except missing memory card), Great Price!

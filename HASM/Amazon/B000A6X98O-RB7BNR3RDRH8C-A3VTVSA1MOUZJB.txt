Title: EHHHHH!! it's ok.
Content:
When I first got this heater, I thought it was pretty good. A 4 stars because it was a little bit noisier than I expected but that's just how most portable heaters are. 2 months later I noticed that there is this annoying whirring/clicking noise that sounds like something came loose within the machine itself. It's definitely very annoying and something probably is loose inside the machine. I am going to bring the heater back to costco and try to exchange it for a new one. WIsh me luck cuz i don't have the receipt.

Title: Good Suction, Expensive
Content:
Despite the fact that the Dysons have never been a top pick on Consumer Reports (even though they consistently rate high for brand reliability), I went ahead and purchased the DC23 Turbinehead from Target for $399.
As people often find when purchasing a new vacuum, they pick up a lot of dust and dirt in the carpet that their old vacuum left behind. Mainly because most older vacuums just lose suction even if you replace the filters and maintain all the parts. I find that to be frustrating and disappointing, and that's mainly one of the reasons that I went with the Dyson -- I'm hoping it lives up to their tagline (Never Loses Suction). 
The suction on the DC23 is good. The turbine head attachment spins quickly and pulls in cat litter and other little particles in the carpet. I was revolted by the giant thick dust ball I picked up in just one bedroom with the first use. The DC23 does it's job well. So here's the run down of what I like and don't like about this model:
Likes
-Excellent suction, vacuums well. Easily picks up all the cat hair and cat litter I throw at it.
-Small, light weight and portable
-Beautifully designed -- it's shocking to look at this model next to all the Hoovers, Dirt Devils, and Bissells of the world that look like something straight out of the 80's. Also glad they are moving away from the yellow plastic!
-Easy to empty dust bin, no bags
-Because of the small head, this vacuum can go where most uprights cannot -- under beds and tables.
Dislikes
-It's a little expensive, however, will be well worth it if it actually lasts a long time without losing suction
-Storage is a little flimsy -- the hose just sort of hangs out off of the vacuum and the head attachment very loosely attaches to the canister base.

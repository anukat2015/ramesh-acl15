Title: Overall a good vacuum but couple of design flaws
Content:
After few uses I noticed a couple of issues. The hose is too rigid and doesn't rotate easily when moving around. It also needs to be wire reinforced. I had it collapse on me when moving around. The cord doesn't retract too well. Seems that the spring loaded mechanism is too weak. I have to help it. The bulb in the attachment burnt out after 1 use. The suction is good and cleans carpets really well. Our apartment has mostly carpeting, so I don't know how it cleans hard wood floors. It's on the heavy side too. Previously I had a Bosch canister vacuum. While the Hoover vacuum cleans better, Bosch was much lighter and smaller. I guess it was smaller because of smaller motor. Overall I like this vacuum. We'll see how it holds up over time.

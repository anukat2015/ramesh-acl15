Title: The Good and the Bad
Content:
When you drop over $300 on a vacuum, you expect to be wowed. While I like the Dyson DC23 Turbinehead Canister, I don't LOVE it and find some rather annoying flaws in its design. 
First, the GOOD: 
-GREAT Suction
-It's bagless--I love that you can see what you're sucking up! 
-Looks pretty cool--I don't know if this is exactly a PRO
Now, the BAD (based off of what I've discovered after a few uses) 
-Hose length seems shorter than the average canister
-The hose attaches to the LEFT of the canister which makes for awkward right-hand vacuuming. Should attach to the front to be fair to both right and left-handers 
-It is heavy
-The handle is awkward and takes some getting used to 
-The actual "head" (as in turbinehead) of the vacuum needs to be wider and while I appreciate the ability to maneuver it by a turn of the handle, that capability makes the head more cumbersome to use 
-Does not work well on carpet

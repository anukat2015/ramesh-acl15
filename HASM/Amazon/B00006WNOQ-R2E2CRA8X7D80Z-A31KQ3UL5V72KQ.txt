Title: JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!!
Content:
I would give this piece of junk 0 stars, but you have to give it one. It worked for about a month of light use, and then it stopped. I called customer service at the company (Honeywell/KAZ, not the people who are selling it on this Amazon spot), and all they would do is allow ME to pay $10 to ship the piece of junk back to them! So now I've paid twice. DON'T BUY IT!!!

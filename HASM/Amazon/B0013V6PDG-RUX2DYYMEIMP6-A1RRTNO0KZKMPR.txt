Title: Warm but not Toasty
Content:
I recieved this as a Christmas gift-and I am happy I got it. 
My office is located in a single story building that is on a carpeted concrete slab. Regardless of how high the temperature is cranked up, my feet are always cold. It seems that the concrete just sucks the heat out of them.
I installed the Toasty Toes in the slanted position and have noticed a definite improvement. Although the one reviewer is correct in that you are limited to a certain position to keep your feet on it, if you are computer bound as I am, it doesn't make a difference. The platform can be adjusted to improve your comfort level and that helps.
Is it a space heater-no, but it never pretends to be. There are two power levels, 75 and 150 watts, designed for warming, not heating. It doesn't compare to a 1000 watt space heater, but it makes no noise and doesn't blast so much heat that you become hot.
It is a simple product and may be a little over priced, but the Amazon price is about the best you can get. So if you want a simple, quiet, subtle heat source-this is the one for you.

Title: Too Expensive Here - Dell's Cheaper
Content:
When Dell sells this on occasion for $6,700, why spend $1,000 more here? Which goes to say that if Dell can sell it for $1,000 cheaper and still make money, why is this camera so expensive here and elsewhere? There's no doubt the camera is the best camera ever made but the price is too high. Shop around and save money.

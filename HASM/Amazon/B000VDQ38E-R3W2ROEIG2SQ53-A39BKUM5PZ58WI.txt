Title: Destroys carpet
Content:
My wife used this vacuum all over our brand new home (new construction). She used the "High Carpet" setting and it still frayed the tips of the carpeting over several places in the house. If you use the hose attachments, the roller keeps spinning while the vacuum is upright. I have roller-length carpet burns all over my new carpet. I did some testing on a spare piece of carpet we have and the different carpet settings make absolutely no difference whatsoever.
Needless to say I'm very upset, and Bissell was less than helpful on the phone when my wife called. I will be calling them this week to expect a full refund.

Title: Has completely changed everything
Content:
I had forgotten where I was supposed to meet a client one day and had no way of checking my email (no blackberry or near computer).  I found out that the Ipod touch was for more than music and found my mobile email device.  I bought the Ipod touch 8GB and now I can constantly check my email freely/for free.  Though low on memory I use it for one app, to hold my photos and to check my email and leave the memory/video role to my Zune 120 GB.  The Ipod Touch is the perfect mobile web product allowing me to check and write email with ease.  If you do any sort of business or are in college get an Ipod touch.  Do it (of course only if there is abundant Wi-fi). Do it.

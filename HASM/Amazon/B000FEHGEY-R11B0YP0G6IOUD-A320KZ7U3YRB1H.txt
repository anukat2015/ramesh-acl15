Title: Don't buy this product!
Content:
I was looking forward to this style of four cup coffeepot as far as ease of use.  The product is very flimsy and has been trouble since day one.  The swing basket often comes off it's pins and the inner basket is difficult to remove.  Definitely not worth the price!  There are cheaper alternatives to making a small pot of coffee.

Title: You get what you pay for.
Content:
The quit and dirty:
What this camera does well: 
1. Zoom
What this camera does not do well:
1. Take pictures in bright light - the camera can't balance the light and dark portions of a frame.  I tried every setting and it just does not work. Part of the picture is over exposed and the other part is underexposed. Forget taking pictures on sunny days. This camera just can't handle sun.
2. Take pictures in low light - the camera can't adjust the shutter speed and aperture in low light.  Unless you have a tripod ALL low light (including predusk) images will be blurry.
3. Preserve batteries - This camera eats batteries like I have never seen. Two days max for heaving use.
4. Take decent video - the video and sound quality are poor. While you can zoom in and out in video mode, the autofocus is so slow that zooming cause significant amounts of blurred video.
If you still want to buy this camera after reading the four cons listed above, then you are not serious about photography.
I took this camera on a 10 day trip to Europe and within the first two days, knew that I had wasted $150 on the purchase.

Title: Not good for room or office!
Content:
While these are very quiet heaters, they don't really work to warm up a room. You don't feel the warm, unless you are sitting right next to it. They don't heat up even a small room or office. I had better luck with the Lasko and the Holmes small ones with fans. I just got the small grey Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater and it works great, the cost is the same as this one (twenty bucks) excellent job at warming up my 12'x12' room. Also the small Holmes HFH416 with temp. settings is a very good one.

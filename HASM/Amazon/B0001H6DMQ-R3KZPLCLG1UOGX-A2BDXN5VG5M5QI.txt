Title: Try the WindTunnel "Electronic" Canister Instead
Content:
That model costs just a few dollars more and comes with an additional powered hand-held tool, and also a hard-floor cleaning tool, both of which this model lacks. The lack of adaquate tools means that this model is very difficult to use on stairs or for cleaning large hardwood floors.

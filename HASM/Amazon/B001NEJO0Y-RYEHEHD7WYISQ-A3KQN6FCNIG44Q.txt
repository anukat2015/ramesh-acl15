Title: FANTASTIC LAPTOP
Content:
I ordered this laptop from Amazon.com along with several additional products. I paid for the fastest shipping. I got the other products from Amazon.com almost immediately, but the laptop never arrived. I called the customer service department (located in India.....at least in my experience). I attempted to explain my frustration over the fact that I paid for the fastest shipping, but only received the products that would do me no good without the computer, all to no avail. I requested that rather than having to wait another four days for the laptop, would they please overnight it to me. The representative stated she could not do that. I attempted to reach a United States representative for Amazon.com, but that was useless. I cancelled the order and bought the computer at Best Buy. The next day, the computer from Amazon.com DID arrive, after the customer service representative told me "it can't be done". I refused the shipment and after several telephone calls (again, ending up in India) Amazon.com did refund the shipping charges. 
The fact that I had to deal with Amazon.com's customer service department in India has pretty much turned me off to them. I live in The United States of America, not India.

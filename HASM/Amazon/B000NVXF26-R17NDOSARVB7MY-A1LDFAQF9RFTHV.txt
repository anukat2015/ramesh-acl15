Title: E-510
Content:
Before I bought this camera, I searched the web for equivalent products. I was slightly biased in that I already owned a Olympus camera (E-300). However, what I was looking for was a camera that had 10 or more mega pixels, and had image stabilization as I planned to use it for nature photography; animals don't stand still. Light weight was not a as important but nice to have.
This camera met all of my expectations. The image stabilization works quite well. I had one surprise; the lenses were also lighter than their predecessors. I highly recommend this camera.

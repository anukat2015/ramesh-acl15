Title: Zune HD has screen flicker issues not resolved!
Content:
Since it was released, the screen flicker has always been issues for many users. Search on Google about "Zune HD Flicker" and you will see what I am talking about. I just purchased this yesterday 12/27/09 and I have already noticed the screen flicker issues. I wish I had known about this issue earlier so I don't have to waste my time going about returning it. So I am posting here so you know before you purchase this item. This actually affects both 32GB and 16GB version of Zune HD. Other than that I am quite happy with it, I like the music subscription service where you can stream or download albums. I am just hoping Microsoft get their act together to fix this issue and make it one of the better players on the market. but so far it has been no luck, and doubt it can be fixed by firmware update. It seems like a hardware shielding issue.

Title: Good Machine BUT it's  4 - 5oz cups NOT 32 Ounces
Content:
Just got this coffee maker and it's really great.  HOWEVER when I read the manual I noted that it said one tablespoon of coffee for each 5 ounce cup.  
"Huh?" I thought.  And you know what?  It's 4 five-ounce cups of coffee NOT 4 eight-ounce cups.  So this coffee maker really only makes ONE LARGE MUG plus a warm-up splash.  
This is NOT Mr. Coffee's fault I learned. Just about ALL coffee makers when they list number of CUPS actually mean 5 ounces (a European metric) NOT the American 8 ounces.
So beware. If all you really want is a large mug plus a splash/warmer, get this.  It's really cute and quick.  But if you really want 32 ounces of coffee, this will NOT do the job.  You need to get a coffee maker that claims to make 6 cups or more (6 x 5 = 30).

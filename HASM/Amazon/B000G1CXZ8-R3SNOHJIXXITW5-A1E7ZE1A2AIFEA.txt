Title: Nice heater, quiet
Content:
So far, this heater works well.  It's quiet, and the oscillating feature is nice.  It has a small footprint, so it doesn't take up too much room in my living area.  Only negative is that the heat doesn't carry too far, so you need to be sitting very close in order to feel the warmth.

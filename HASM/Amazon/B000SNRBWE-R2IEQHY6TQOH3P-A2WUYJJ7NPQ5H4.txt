Title: Poor quality, horrible service
Content:
I bought this to replace my venerable super performing Samsung that after ten years, the hose cracked.  I am sure it would have run for many more but the part was no longer available.  Making matters worse, Samsung no longer builds vacuums.Unfortunately, I decided to replace it with this Panasonic.  This product exudes cheap all over.  It is very weak in the suction department.  Don't get me wrong, it sucks big time in the quality department.  Out of the box the on/off switch was intermittent.  Sometimes it wouldn't turn on and sometimes it wouldn't turn off.  I called Panasonic and they instructed me to drive it from Reno, NV, to Sacramento, CA, 120 miles or so away.  I argued with them for several weeks and eventually they agreed to provide me a pre-paid UPS sticker although I had to pay to have it packed.  Off it went on 11/21.  Unfortunately, Panasonic is unaware of who services their junk and the service center refused it.  As Panasonic issued the sticker it was then sent on to Virginia Beach, VA, some 3000 miles away.  On 12/10 they called and said it was fixed.  I learned today, 12/26, after numerous calls and long waits, it was still there.I hope it gets lost should they ever return it so I can buy from someone else.

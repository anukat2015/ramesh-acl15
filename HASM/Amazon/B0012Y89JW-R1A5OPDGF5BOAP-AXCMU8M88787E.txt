Title: Great dSLR for the price!
Content:
For an enthusiast, I'm very impressed with the image quality from this camera, especially for the price. I was even impressed with pics taken with the kit lens, but I primarily use a 28-135mm as an "everyday" lens (but much bigger and heavier than the kit lens). The kit lens was simply lacking in zoom capability for my typical shooting needs, but the kit is probably a better indoor lens. Still tweaking camera settings to get optimal results, but I'll probably have to tweak again after adding a polarizing filter. Overall it's lightweight (for a dSLR), fairly comfortable in-hand, and easy-to-learn menu system.

Title: Great Camera!!
Content:
This camera is excellent!  Takes great pictures - very easy to use.  I know nothing about cameras, so this one is perfect for me!  I feel like I'm taking professional pics!! You can click one picture after another very fast, so there is no pause - you are actually taking a picture of what you see - there isn't a delay like in other digital cameras.
The only thing I don't like about the camera is having to look through the view finder to actually take the picture, but I can deal with that!

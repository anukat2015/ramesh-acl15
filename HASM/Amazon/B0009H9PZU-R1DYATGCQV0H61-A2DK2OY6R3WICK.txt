Title: iPod PWNED...film at eleven!
Content:
MP3 players are pretty much the norm in today's society.  If you own a computer, CDs and/or music files, and love the convenience of taking your music with you, there simply isn't a better way to go.  Of course, the larger your music collection, the larger "size" player you'll likely need.  Then there's the "other stuff" to consider; features, file support, the player's physical size, etc...it can be akin to buying a new car.
If you've been searching for an affordable, compact player with a decent-size hard drive and features you wouldn't normally find on a standard player, may I recommend that this is the one for you.  It may not be the newest model on the lot, but it's nice, reliable, slim and trim, and seats up to about 8,000 songs comfortably (depending on what format they're in).  I've owned mine for about a year and a half now, and so far it's performed beautifully overall.  Not only that, it was about a hundred bucks cheaper than the 20GB iPod at time of purchase.
So if you'd care to hop in, let's break this thing down a little further to give you a better idea of what this beauty can do:
THE GOOD:
--First off, the size of the hard drive.  She'll hold about 5,000 tracks in .mp3 format, which is the standard format for most music files.  Some music files, depending on where you get them, can be in different formats (like .wma) which are smaller and have slightly less sound quality.  If you want a conversion, 5,000 MP3s = about 8,000 WMA files.  As you can see, this model has quite a bit of trunk space, and unless you've got a monster music collection, you'll have plenty of room to spare.
--That's all fine and good, but what about the sound quality?  As MP3 players go, it's great!  The sound quality (depending on the file, of course) is top-notch, and with 31 different equalizer settings, you can pick the right one to match pretty much whatever type of music you're listening to.  (And if you don't like any of the default equalizer settings, you can tweak your own and save them as a custom setting.)
--Want to talk about some more features?  How about a 2" LCD screen that lets you look at pictures saved on the device?  There's also an FM radio, text document reader, built-in recorder with mic (you can record either sound or the FM radio signal), a browser to look through the files on the device, an alarm clock (you probably won't use that too much, but it's there if you need it), plus the standard repeat and shuffle features for music playback.  It's got a pretty decent battery life on it as well; about 12 hours of continuous play on a new player.  The battery's internal, though, and can't be removed without completely disassembling the player.
--User friendliness...this is always a big issue when you're looking for electronics of any kind.  Usually, if you can't work it at all in the store (without the manual), chances are you won't take it home.  You can pretty much take the iriver out of the box, and after a few minutes of playing with it, will get the basics down.  The menu is quite uncomplicated and self-explanatory.  As far as transferring files, there are a couple of ways to do that, and they're both painfully easy.  The fastest way is to just drag and drop from your PC's hard drive into the device (after all, the iriver's basically a portable external hard drive) using Windows Explorer.  The iriver works brilliantly with Windows Media Player as well, though (version 10 and up; version 10 comes with the installation CD in case your PC has an earlier version).  With Media Player, you just connect the device to your PC (standard USB connection), open Media Player, hit "Sync", and forget about it.  Media Player will transfer all the music files in your hard drive to the iriver automatically (although it does take longer overall), and if it comes across a file that's already on your device, it will be skipped over.  (You can pick and choose songs to transfer as well, but that of course takes more time.)  As far as text files and pictures, they can be easily dragged and dropped using Windows Explorer.
The touch-sensitive up/down arrow "clicker" is very smooth and responsive, scrolling through your music is ultra-quick (handy if you have a lot of music to peruse through), and there aren't a lot of other confusing buttons on the thing (power, forward, back, pause, and player lock; that's it).  The lock feature is easy to turn on and off, and will help conserve your player's battery by keeping it from turning on accidentally.  If the player ever locks up (like I said, it's a hard drive; it's gonna happen eventually), the embedded reset switch is easy enough to get to.
THE BAD:
--Not that there's a lot of "bad" to speak of, but one aspect that can be irritating is the power/USB cable that comes with it.  The wonky design hassles things up a bit; the connector is unique to this device (in other words, you can't hook up any old AC adapter to it), and it's designed in such a way that the USB cable is grafted onto the AC connection.  I'm sure someone thought it was a good idea, but for traveling it just makes things awkward.
--As said before, even though the internal lithium battery is rechargeable, it's not removable without complete disassembly (and that's next to impossible).  As you may know, a rechargeable battery can only be charged a few hundred times before it dies.  After a year and a half, my iriver still charges up pretty quickly, but the battery only lasts maybe 8 hours (a brand-new one lasts about 12-13 hours).  I'm noticing the battery's "memory" is filling up, and will maybe last another year or so before it only runs on AC power.  Be warned; it's best to let the battery run out completely before charging it each time.
--Virtually no accessories exist for this device.  We all know about all the cool toys you can hook an iPod up to...where're the boom boxes and carrying cases for the iriver?  The company kind of dropped the ball here.  As far as carrying cases go, it does come with a soft plastic skin-type thing with a sturdy belt clip (which is actually pretty durable, but a veritable magnet for dust and dirt and difficult to clean).  It is compatible with standard FM modulators and portable speakers through the headphone jack (in fact, I'm listening through my PC speakers now), so it's at least easy to share your tunes with the world.  (By the way, iPod accessories will not work with this device; although the connector is similar, it's not the same.)
THE UGLY:
--Nothing ugly about it.  Definitely a keeper!
I'm a very "latest and greatest" type of guy when it comes to electronic toys and the like, but I've been very satisfied with this player for as long as I've owned it.  While it won't hold my entire music collection, it will hold a big chunk of it and will keep me in tunes wherever I go.  It's light and compact (about the size of a deck of cards, and just a skosh heavier), it's very simple to use, and it's pretty durable for the most part (I wouldn't go jogging with it or anything, but I have dropped it once or twice without a problem).  A "search" feature would make the interface perfect, but scrolling through files goes fast enough without testing my patience.  Yeah, there's pretty much nothing in the way of accessories (at least a leather or even metal carrying case would be nice; I've ripped the soft plastic case a little just taking it off and on my belt), but that's not even a showstopper.  Overall, if you're looking for a good player that won't break the bank and don't care if it's an iPod, this is the one to go with.  No, it's not the latest and greatest, but it's good workmanship for a very good price (especially now), and you'll get a lot of use out of it.  And isn't that the bottom line?

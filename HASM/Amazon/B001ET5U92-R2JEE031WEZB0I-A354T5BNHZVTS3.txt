Title: Are you kidding me?
Content:
Having dabbled in photography quite a bit over the years, I knew that Nikon made a great quality product.  I had no idea how great until I bought this camera body.
I also purchased the Nikkor 70mm-300mm, 85mm f/1.8, 50mm f/1.8 and the 35mm f/1.8 lenses.
I read the manual, charged the battery and held on tight as I turned the camera on.  The room lights went dim and I knew I was in for some fun.  :)
I also bought ASIN:0470457724 Nikon D90 For Dummies by Julie Adair King because a friend and professional photographer mentioned that this model could be overwhelming for an amateur.  She was right.
In just a few short days, though, I have learned to adjust the aperture, shutter speed, ISO and white balance to turn out some beautiful shots.  There are hundreds of settings and tricks you can use to get the shot right.
Of course, editing software is a plus, but this camera takes such beautiful raw (not just RAW) pictures, editing isn't as necessary as without a DSLR.  The 720p, 24fps video is a plus, too!
If you are just getting serious about your photos, or if you really want to capture that perfect shot without spending your life's savings, the D90 is your ticket.

Title: Canon EOS Rebel XTi Review
Content:
The Canon EOS Rebel XTi is very versitile in the settings that can be used both for the first time digital SLR user or the experienced user.  This camera will function with all of the newer Canon EF AF lenses as well as all of the older EOS AF lenses.  The processor is fast and allows for multiple shots.  The camera works well in low light situations, and fast action shots.  Battery power is good for about 450 shots.  Great features at a reasonable price point.

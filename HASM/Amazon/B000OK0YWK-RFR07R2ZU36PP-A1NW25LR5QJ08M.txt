Title: Zune can't be used as a portable harddrive.
Content:
The Zune can not be used as a portable harddrive like the Apple iPod can.  If Microsoft were to fix this via a firmware update then I would give the item four stars.
However, lacking that feature is a real negative when you consider nearly all other players have it.
Otherwise; I do enjoy the zune interface on the zune itself; it's fast and very clean and well organized.  The zune software for the PC could use some work to make it more user friendly; but it is better than iTunes.

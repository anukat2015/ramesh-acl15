Title: Dysons are the Best, but this model has a couple of drawbacks...
Content:
I am a huge fan of Dysons in general due to their superior quality of dust removal. I like the handy stowaway design of this model and the colours etc are funky and modern. The only negatives are that the handle doesnt lock very well once extended and keeps sliding in, and although the size looks manageable for a small apartment and small person it is relatively heavy and not that easy to lift up stairs etc.

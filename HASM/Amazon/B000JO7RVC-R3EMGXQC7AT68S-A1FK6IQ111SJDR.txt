Title: Fantastic Device
Content:
Bought this for my husband, and it's been great.  He uses it daily.  He was recently hospitalized a couple of days for tests and this thing really saved him from severe boredom.  It seems strange to say, but once you start watching a movie, you really are not aware of the tiny screen.  Right now he has 10 movies, about 15 audiobooks on it, plus music and still has 63.3 GB of space left.  We bought some special software ($40) so that we can convert our DVD's to play in iTunes and it works seamlessly.  The downloading from iTunes has been seamless, as well.

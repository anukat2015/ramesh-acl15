Title: Coffee maker for pods and ground coffee
Content:
SL13 comes with 3 pod holders: single pod, double pod and ground coffee.
Pod coffee comes out weak because the pod holder diameter is a bit larger than Home Cafe and Senseo pods and water can flow around the pod instead of through it.
I had better results with the ground coffee holder, though I felt compelled to put filter paper (2.25 inch diameter) under the coffee.

Title: I got the best!
Content:
I was looking into the Canon Rebel Xsi and came close to buying it when a friend asked, "Have you looked at the 40D?"  It was out of my price range, but after testing it in a few shops, I loved how it felt in my hands.  I agree with other enthusiasts that the Rebels are too lightweight, and I'm a big guy so I need something sturdy to keep up with me.  Had I held the Rebel during beach shoots, I would've been a little overprotective of it, feeling it would drop at any moment (even with the strap). Not the case with the 40D.  
I love the 6.5 fps. It captures incredible images.  The colors are vivid and professional-looking.  Much better than my Canon A620 point-and-shoot.  I've moved up to a camera I respect, and the price difference is justified.  I love what it does, but more importantly, I love the anticipation of what it will do once I master it.

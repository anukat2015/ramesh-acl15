Title: Super user friendly dSLR!
Content:
This is my first dSLR and it has converted me into an avid photographer.  It takes great pictures in auto mode and is amazingly simple to use.  Also has a handy no flash mode when you want to quickly disable the flash.  Large, easy to read LCD screen has big icons for picture modes and doesn't drain the battery.  The charge seems to last forever.  I could not be happier with this camera.  I have used the Nikon D70 and D80 fairly extensively and the Canon feels newer and faster.  This is a great camera!

Title: Good value but strange delays
Content:
I've only had this thing a few weeks, and overall I think it's worth the $$, but I've noticed a strange issue.  I put in a 2 gig card filled with music.  When I first turn the thing on it takes an inordinate amount of time to 'boot up', as if it wasn't built to handle 2 gigs of music.  The problem seems to be worse when the battery is getting old.

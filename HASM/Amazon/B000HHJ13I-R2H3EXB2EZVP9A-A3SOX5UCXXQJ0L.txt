Title: ice box..with lots of extras
Content:
This thing works EXCELLENT....not very noisy..quiter than most portable a/cs and way way quieter than window models...of course.Dehumid. works Great. this thing has a heater too.it blows hard (lol) and is ice cold.  has cool oscilating flap things.Keeps  room chilly. digital readout in color on the unit and has a nifty remote..could have used some backlighting on the remote but its all good. i bought this to keep my home recoding studio nice and cold. the room is about the size of a 2 1/2 car garage... my stuff used to overheat now all is chill. worth every damn penny, although i bought it from ebay brand new in box for $599.00 exactly with no tax (except Texas) and free shipping.

Title: Repair Issues on Handle of Hose
Content:
This is the only Miele S4 Galaxy I have ever repaired.  I have repaired  several Miele Orions.  They all have the same problem.  The radio controlled hose controls.  This technology is new, and has had problems since day one.  They all have been warranty repairs so far, but expensive parts after warranty period.  Great cleaning, but some major technology problems in the hose.  The antenna for the radio controlled hose also has some issues.  The antenna will bend over and point down, which causes difficulty when trying to change the speeds up and down, and turning the vacuum on/off from the hose can be challenging as well.  Best idea is to avoid this canister.

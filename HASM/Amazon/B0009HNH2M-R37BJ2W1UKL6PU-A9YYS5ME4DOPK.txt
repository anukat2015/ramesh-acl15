Title: One of the best vacuum cleaners I've ever had
Content:
This is a very nice product from hoover.  I've had 2 dirt devils that seem to die after about a year.  I like the bag (much better than a filter IMHO), the power cord is self winding which is great, and great to use on the stairs.  But best of all, my cleaning lady loves it, and says it's one of the best vacuums she has ever used, even better than some electroluxes (don't waste your money).

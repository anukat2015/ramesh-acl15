Title: Very powerful and versatile vacuum.
Content:
My cleaning lady requested that we purchase a canister vacuum so she could be more thorough at getting at hard to reach areas like under beds and furniture.  After reading the reviews, I decided to buy the Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum.  It arrived in just a few days and was easy to assemble, and the operating instructions were very intuitive.  The first time it was used it picked up a tremendous amount of material that apparently my previous vacuum was leaving behind.  In addition to the motor driven beater brush main vacuum head, it has a nice, small vacuum driven beater brush attachment for doing stairs, upholstery, etc.  The dirt cup is convenient and easy to clean.  I recommend cleaning it after every whole house vacuuming.  I am wondering about long term durability, as it is mostly made of plastics (as were all the other brands I had reviewed).  I just wish someone was making vacuums from steel/alloys like they used to do.  That being the case, I would have given this product 5 stars.

Title: love it
Content:
I got it to replace my 300D (the original Digital Rebel). Although it is smaller, with the Canon Battery Grip it fits my hands just ok. The pictures are amazing, I see the most improvement at higher ISOs. I am not too crazy about the fact that they went to 10 MP, increased dynamic range or a fullframe sensor would have been nicer. But maybe next time. One change I am not crazy about is a green status light on top of the camera that shines when the unit is on (at least it's not blue like so many LEDs today). I intend to put tape over it to cover it. But these are insignificant complaints. The camera is great, very fast operation (card writes, switch on time...), battery life is amazing.

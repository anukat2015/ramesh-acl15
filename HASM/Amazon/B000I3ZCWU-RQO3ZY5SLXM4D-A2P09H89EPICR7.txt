Title: HATE IT!!!  "BUSY" ALL THE TIME!
Content:
OK,  I am not a professional photographer or anything, but this camera is driving me nuts!!!  I bought this camera from Amazon about a year ago and I mainly use it to take photos of my 1 yr old daughter.  After taking about 20 shots while using the internal flash, the camera starts giving me "busy" errors and I would have to wait about 15 seconds before I can take another shot!  I literally have to wait for 15 seconds on EVERY shot after the error appears!  As a result, I would miss a lot of great shots of my daughter, because the flash has to recycle itself!  I have read different forums online and many other people are getting the same problem, but Canon refuses to admit that there is anything wrong with the camera.  I have had many Canon cameras before this and I never have any problems.  Even my Canon SD450 point and shot takes photos using the flash and NEVER gives this error.  This camera costs a lot more and performs very poorly.

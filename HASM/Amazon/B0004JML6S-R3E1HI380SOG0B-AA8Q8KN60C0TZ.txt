Title: Quality and Pot Problems
Content:
I purchased this coffeemaker for my wife for Christmas. She is an avid coffee drinker who always has a pot brewed. This was definitely the wrong choice! The overall quality of the coffemaker is poor at best but the most aggrevating problem is that it is impossible to pour a cup from the glass decanter without half of it dribbling down the side of the pot onto the counter. Pour it fast, pour it slow, the same results. Only had it a month and already shopping for a new coffemaker and it definitely will not be Krups!

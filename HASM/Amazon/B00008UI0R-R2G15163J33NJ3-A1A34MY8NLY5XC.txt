Title: It's a vacuum
Content:
The style of this vacuum is very nice. It's easy to pick up because of the attached handle and pretty light weight. The attachments don't seem to "snap" on and can fall off during use. The bagless aspect is wonderful although hair seems to be a problem when it gets wrapped around the filter area.
The on/off switch on the handle is great. No looking for the vacuum body. The only downside is getting used to it so that you don't accidentally turn the thing on or off.
All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Title: Great little inexpensive coffee maker!
Content:
I've had two of these Brew 'n Go's (one at home - the other at work) for almost 2 years, and I've never had a problem with either one.  The permanent nylon filter basket is nice, but as another reviewer mentioned, the filter will allow some residue to slip through into your cup.  I simply use a #1 paper filter (or cut down a #2) and that eliminates the residue factor. I roast my own coffee beans, and making single cups of coffee ensures I never have to dump half a pot of 'gourmet' coffee down the drain. You can't go wrong with the great performance and price of this little coffee maker.

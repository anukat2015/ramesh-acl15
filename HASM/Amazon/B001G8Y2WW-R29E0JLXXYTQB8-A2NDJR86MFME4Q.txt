Title: Cuisinart grind and brew
Content:
This is a great coffee maker for the price.  It has a 10 cup thermal pot which is plenty big for us and keeps the coffee very hot without having to have the coffee maker plugged in and wasting electricity.  The coffee tastes great.  The grind then brew option is wonderful to always have freshly ground beans and a programmable timer is nice also.  The only negative is that the bean grinder is a bit loud but I've never encountered one that wasn't.  When we bought ours there was a $30 mail in rebate which made the price quite nice.

Title: Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens
Content:
Received the camera, open the package, charged the camera and the next day assembled the parts.  
I eagerly turned on the camera but it failed to power up.  Repeated the effort many times but no action.
Had the battery checked out at a local shop.  Battery was fine.  They were unable to power up the camera.  
Camera was returned.  I then ordered the same camera from a competitor.  It works great.

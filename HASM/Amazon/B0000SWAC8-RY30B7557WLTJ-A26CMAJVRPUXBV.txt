Title: Too Easily Broken!!!!
Content:
I am a house cleaner and one of the houses that I clean for has this vacuum.  I find that I am having problems with the rug attachment releasing and the prongs bending.  The owners had to get new parts and now I think they are starting to wear again.  This is a new vac and I am very careful with this equiptment.  I would never purchase this vacuum!! I think it is terrible.  Definately not made like they used to be.  I use alot of different types of vacuums and this is not made well at all!!!! The cleaning power is great so much that it feels like the rug attachment is going to snap off, very powerful!!!!

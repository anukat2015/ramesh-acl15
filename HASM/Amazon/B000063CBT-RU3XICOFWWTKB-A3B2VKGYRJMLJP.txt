Title: I really like this machine!
Content:
I think it is a shame that this coffee maker is getting such poor reviews.  This is a good machine that does what it is supposed to do.  I have been using this machine daily for two months and have no complaints.  
The Brewed coffee is excellent, even in small batches, and the expresso maker does a terrific job.  
At $50 you can't find a better deal then this machine.

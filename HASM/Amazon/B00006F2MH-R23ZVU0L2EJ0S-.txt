Title: ULTIMATE DISAPPOINTMENT !
Content:
After three mornings of inferior coffee, I will be boxing up my new purchase and returning it. The coffee is weak. I have increased the amount of beans and that has helped only slightly.  I love hot coffee (nickname....asbestos mouth) but the coffee remaining in the glass carafe becomes so hot, as to be scalding.  If you pre-program to have coffee ready when you get up in the morning you will not need an alarm clock!  The grinder is so loud that it woke us with a start and sent the cat running.  I agree with the other reviewers who did not like the mess in the grinder (damp grounds)and the many parts to be washed and dried.  Modern technology should make our mornings easier.  I thought this was the answer.......but it was the ULTIMATE DISAPPOINTMENT.

Title: Best in a small room
Content:
This heater is silent, easy to use, and takes the chill out of a room, but is best for a small, enclosed room.  It cycles on / off and doesn't throw off enough heat to be dangerous (but children should be kept away from any appliance like this.)  We haven't seen our first electric bill after plugging in, so the jury is still out as to whether or not it offsets the fuel oil bill.  It's great for warming the hands after walking the dog!

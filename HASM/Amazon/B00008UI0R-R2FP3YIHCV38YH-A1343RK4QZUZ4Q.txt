Title: Great Buy!
Content:
PRO
Quiet, powerful and easy to operate.
CON
The filters clog easily and the hose does too.
The Dirt cup capacity -- this needs to be emptied after each cleaning which can be quit messy.  Empty outside.
Overall, I'm very satisfied with the unit. It's quiet, compact, and does a superb job of cleaning

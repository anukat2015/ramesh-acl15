Title: Excellent choice!
Content:
We are very happy with the Rebel XT.
Most digital cameras, in my opinion, seemed to still have an artificial or "cold" quality, but the Rebel XT has an organic feel to the quality and "warmth" of analogue photography, but has the convenience of digital.
It has very high quality, but a low price!

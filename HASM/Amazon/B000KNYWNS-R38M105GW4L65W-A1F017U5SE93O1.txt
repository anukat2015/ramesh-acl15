Title: Used it for 2 days, and returned it!
Content:
I bought this AC to keep my bedroom cool at night and while I'm at work. I have a chinchilla that needs to be kept in a room cooler than 75 degrees.
The AC works great for the first hour or two that it's on - but after it's been running for awhile, it starts blowing out room-temp air! 
I woke up sweating last night at 3:00 and had to switch to the swamp cooler in the house to cool off! Then today I left the AC running for my fur-baby and got home to a room that was 77 degrees! The noise was the least of my concerns - I trusted this thing to keep my pet cool, and it failed me!
I would not trust this AC to cool anything now!

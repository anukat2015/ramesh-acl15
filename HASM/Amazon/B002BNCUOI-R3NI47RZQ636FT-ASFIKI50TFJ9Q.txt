Title: Awesome for Linux
Content:
I agree with the comments about HP support. They are overseas, know little about the product, and are idiots. 
I repartitioned the drive (after shrinking the Windows partition with instructions from ubuntuguide dot org) and installed Kubuntu 9.04 Linux within 1 hour. Everything worked right away -- from webcam, to wireless, to video, to VMWare. This is one of the best laptops for Linux. I consider myself proficient at computers, so I also installed a few other OSs (on multiple partitions). No problems. I love this laptop. It is fast, and the widescreen great for movies. After 2 months I have discovered no problems (other than that Windows Vista sucks, but we all knew that, and the need to remove all the junkware that HP pre-installs.) But don't use the recovery disk(s) -- it wipes the entire hard drive clean and wipes out all your data. I learned this the hard way. HP sucks at software (and support), even though the hardware is great.

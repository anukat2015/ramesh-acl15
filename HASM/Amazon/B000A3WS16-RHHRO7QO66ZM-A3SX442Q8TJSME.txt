Title: Great New Features...but Some "Caveat Emptor", Too
Content:
The battery on my 3G finally turned in its notice. So I upgraded tothe 30gb iPod with video.
PROS:
- The video! The screen resolution is amazing. Coldplay's "Speed of Sound" video, with its amazing rainbows of colors, makes your iPod come alive.
- The iTunes Video library! A very worthy selection of videos are available for you to make your own. Christopher Walken dancing in "Weapon of Choice", Stone Temple Pilots' trippy "Days of the Week", Foo Fighter's "Learning to Fly", Alanis' "Everything"--great stuff. 
- The memory! 30 gb is twice what I supported before. More than enough room (for now)!
- The podcasts! I've been a huge fan of Jack Horkheimer's "Star Gazer" program on PBS. Now I can watch these episodes as podcasts right from the palm of my hand. 
CONS:
- Yes, the biggest is the battery. And not so much because the battery for video will last--yes--an hour or so, but because once again Apple is totally...TOTALLY... misleading prospective buyers. Since when did Apple get so crooked?? The specs state "up to 2 hours". Sure--maybe with the backlight off. But me, personally, I'd like to see what I'm watching. How do they think people can actually watch whole movies on this thing?? Do I smell "class action, part II" here?
- The lack of support for older perihperals. You won't find one of those interface ports on these. So toss away your former accessories. 
- No firewire support. It's all now totally usb, baby. And the included white USB cable is about three feet long. You don't get much distance from the pc to the tabletop. 
- No dock connector. Although if you have an old iPod dock you can still use it. Just pop out the old cable and plug in the new USB cable. 
- No instruction manual. There's a .pdf file on the disk that you can drag and drop to your pc desktop, but no opportunities for bathroom reading here. And am I the only one who finds Adobe Acrobat a bit annoying? 
- The screen scratches. I'm so paranoid about this that I've just left the cellophane sheet on (the one that that comes on the iPod when you first get it). I just peel it back and let it flap back down to eliminate bubbles. 
There you have it...

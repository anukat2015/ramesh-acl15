Title: Great coffee! Only a few recommended improvements
Content:
I am very happy with my new coffee maker.  Great coffee and quick and more quiet than my previous one (krups).  Two things I would change - you cannot tell how much water you are pouring in when you look into the coffeemaker...it is dark and the numbers are pretty much useless.  You have to go by the carafe to measure water. I wish I could see the cup marks better on the coffee maker.  Second, I wish you could turn off the beeps as an option for when coffee is done.  Other than that I am very happy with the product.

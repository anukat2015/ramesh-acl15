Title: OK, but doesnt pick up well enough
Content:
Very disappointed with this product.  It makes a noise like a jet engine about to take off, the vacuum head is heavy and cumbersome to manoever; the cord is ridiculously short, but worse out of all, it doesnt pick up small bits on carpet, eg fluff, threads, beads and generally the bits you are trying to vacuum up, its not that it moves them around or pushes them out of the way - it just does not pick them up at all!
Took it back to the store after 1 day.

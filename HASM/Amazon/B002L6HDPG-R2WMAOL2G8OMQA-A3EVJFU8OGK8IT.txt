Title: Truly awful sound quality for playback
Content:
Cool radio but the playback of mp3 and AAC is so so so bad. This was a replacement for my nano 2nd gen to play in the car but I sold it back to Gazelle after a month or trying to make it sound good. Get the Creative Zen X-Fi or a Sony player, awesome sound quality on both.

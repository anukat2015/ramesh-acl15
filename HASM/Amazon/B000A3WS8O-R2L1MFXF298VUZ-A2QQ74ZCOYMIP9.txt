Title: Not bad
Content:
I bought the 60GB refurbished.  It took a long time to get to my place ( i think i ordered from digimedia?) and the tracking information was non-existant until the item was delivered. I got the Ipod and it only had a small scratch on the screen and a few small ones on the back, but no big deal.  I have had a few problems with it freezing and refusing to charge and I don't know if that is a common problem  with all ipods or if its just because i bought a used one.  I don't know.  Was 175 dollars refurb.  Just an FYI, the apple store online sells the 80 gig refurbs for 169 and do not charge shipping.  The just don't always have them in stock.  Buy refurbished from apple directly and you get the manufacturer warranty.

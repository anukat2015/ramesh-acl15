Title: worried about clicking noise
Content:
I bought this product because I trusted Mr. Coffee brands makers to be quality devices. It does brew coffee differently, and the coffee is weaker and murkier, and it never brews five cups and "exhales" the rest of the coffee long after you've poured your cup... however, I marked that to the basket and things I didn't like, and it felt cheaper than most Mr. Coffee machines, but I could live with what I felt were poor design features, but now, starting two weeks ago, when finished brewing, it makes loud clicks. Repeatedly. Very loud, almost alarming clicks.  
I am worried there is a short within and it is potentially dangerous to leave it plugged in on even on for any length of time. 
I am throwing it out. Very disappointed in Mr. Coffee for this model.

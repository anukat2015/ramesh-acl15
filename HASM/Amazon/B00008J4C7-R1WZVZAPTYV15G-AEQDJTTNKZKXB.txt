Title: Vrrroooommm!
Content:
Just got home from Target, and couldn't wait to plug in my new roadster...  Pulled the canister out of the box, and attached the hoses,&#60;br /&#62;
plugged into electricity and vroom, off I went...  Zipping across my wood floors and sucking up anything and everything in my path with a huge smile spreading across my face.  Cleaning isn't my favorite thing to do, but with a vacuum as nifty and zippy as this, and excellent suckage, it sure doesn't hurt like it used to...  I used to be afraid of sharks, but this is one great white that I love to play with... ; )

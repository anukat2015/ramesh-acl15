Title: Parts busted on first use!
Content:
I was so excited to be getting a decent vacuum cleaner and yes it was great on the hardwood floors but then i gave it a run on the rug and on came this fancy rotator brush which then busted 10 seconds later.. i haven't taken it apart yet but i think the belt is busted. thank goodness there is a simple nozzle for the floors i can use cause god knows i am too lazy to get the broken one fixed. disappointing. why do they need to put those stupid rotating brushes in vacuums anyway?

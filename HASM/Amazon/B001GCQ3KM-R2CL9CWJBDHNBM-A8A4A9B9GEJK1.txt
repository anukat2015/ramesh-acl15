Title: Sansa Fuse is the best MP3 player I have found
Content:
Great MP3 player, Audio quality blows away the ipod's
I got the 8 gig version and put in a 16 gig micro SD card, it will support 32 gig cards as well but could not find one local.
the new firmware also supports flac lossless audio :)
Menu system is good, they are working on ROCK BOX port for it.
[...]
get one you will not be disappointed!

Title: Love it!
Content:
I've used my new Cuisinart 4-cup for a few weeks now and I love it.  It makes a great cup or two of coffee and is easy to clean.  Unlike a few other reviewers, I like the lid - it stays on great, controls the pouring to a smooth stream (no gushing) and easily lifts off for cleaning.  I have not had any leakage of water from the resevoir to the heating area - it's a tight unit and works great.  I would like to get about 15 more minutes in before the auto turn-off feature kicks in on the weekend.  I've owned Krups, Braun, Mr. Coffee, and a few no-name makes before and this one is the best so far.  It's streamlined and takes up very little counter space - no more worries about chipping or breaking the carafe as it's stainliess steel.  Highly recommended.

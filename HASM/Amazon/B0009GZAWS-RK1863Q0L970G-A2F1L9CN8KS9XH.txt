Title: Perfect Affordable First-Time Digital SLR!
Content:
I was vacillating between the Canon Rebel XT and the Nikon D50 for my first Digital SLR. The Rebel has more megipixels than the D50 but I like the larger and solid feel that the Nikon has. I was also wanting a package that provided a kit lens that had acceptable quality but kept the total purchase price down. I could not get the Rebel XT with a lens for under $750.00 but I was able to buy the Nikon D50 with a Nikkor Auto Focus 28-80mm Zoom lens all for under $600.00. The kit lens that came with the Nikon provides average quality while the lens that comes with the Rebel XT is below average.
I was able to view samples from both cameras on the digital photography web site called dpreview
I liked the color saturation and balance of the Nikon D50 over the samples from the Rebel XT and that played a big part in my decision. I know the Rebel has features that the Nikon D50 does not have but the D50 meets my needs. The known compromises that the D50 has is a non-backlit settings/status display on the top of the camera and no depth-of-field preview.
The Nikon D50 works well with my Mac OS X and iPhoto with out having to use a card reader. I am able to plug the camera into my USB port and import with iPhoto or use Photoshop CS's File Browser to preview the images on the virtual disk that my Nikon D50 creates on my system's desktop finder.

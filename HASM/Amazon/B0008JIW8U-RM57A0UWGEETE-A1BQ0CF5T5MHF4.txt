Title: served me well, but it's not without problems
Content:
i had no issues with filters folding over or grounds getting into the pot. i did, however, experience a small amount of coffee spilling out of the carafe while pouring. i also found it impossible to pause it in the middle of brewing without having coffee spill all over the plate. a bit disappointed now b/c the carafe just shattered on the tile floor and replacements don't seem to be easy/cheap to get.

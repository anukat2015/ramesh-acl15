Title: Review of Soleus MS10R Space Heater
Content:
I am very happy with the Soleus MS10R Reflective Space Heater. Basically it is like a fan only it is a heater. It has a safety switch that turns it off, a remote operates all functions, which include a timer, 2 settings for the heat level and the thing oscillates back and forth so it will more efficiently heat a room. The unit was on sale for an excellent price. The shipping and handling charges were reasonable. The unit only took a few days to arrive, and that was in the middle of the Christmas rush! In fact I was so happy with the one I ordered for myself, I ordered 2 more for each of my kids to use in their homes.

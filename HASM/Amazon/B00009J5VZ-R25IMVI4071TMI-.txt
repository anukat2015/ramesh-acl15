Title: A great MP3 player
Content:
I've had this MP3 player now for about 2 weeks.  I love it.  The sound quality is excellent, the controls handle well, and the size and weight rock.  I reviewed several before deciding on the iPod and I'm not sorry.  Why only 4 stars?  Like everyone else, I'm not thrilled with the software.  It works but that's all I'll say for it.  Also, the cost is considerably more then other comparible players.  Those are the only downsides that I've found.  If you buy it, you wont be sorry.

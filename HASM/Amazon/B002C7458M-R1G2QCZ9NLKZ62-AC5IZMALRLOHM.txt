Title: MacBook Pro question
Content:
Question here - not a review: Some previous buyers have indicated that since mid September, select customers received OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard. Earlier, in the product description, even AMZN had a SL logo right under the price. Now, it's gone. The actual description never changed from OSX 10.5 Leopard. Can anyone confirm that they have or haven't received 10.6 since mid-September?

Title: Love the Keurig B60
Content:
I've been through several Home Cafe single serve machines and none lasted longer than 6 months, the free Gevalia machine lasted two months and then I got a Keurig. Best cup of coffee I've ever tasted.  Love the convenience of single serving since I'm the only one in the household that drinks coffee.  Assortment of coffee available is awesome and using the bold & extra bold coffees you can make a nice strong 11 oz cup of coffee.  Brewing temp adjustability is great.  Other coffee makers didn't get it hot enough so if you added refrigerated cream it cooled too quickly. I'm in love! LLR

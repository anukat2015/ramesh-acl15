Title: Best Heater Ever
Content:
With a 1842 - 18 room house the heating is all on one line. Can't turn off any rooms. Average heating cost per month pre- Lasko $850.00 oil/$250.00 electric to keep the whole house at 65 constant temperature. Now with the Lasko we can turn the house heat back to 55 and use the Lasko in the room where we are sitting or sleeping. Safe, clean very fast warm-up heat and our total bill for February with all the snow was only $650 oil and $205.00 electric. BIG DIFFERENCE. Most importantly the Lasko kept the bedroom at 70 and very comfortable. Units are light weight and easily moved room to room. We are believers and recommend this unit to anyone.

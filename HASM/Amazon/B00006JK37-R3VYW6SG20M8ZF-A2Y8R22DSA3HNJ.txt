Title: A Dream Come True!
Content:
This camera is the answer to my dreams.  Not only can I see what I'm shooting right away, I can rest assured that I didn't mess up an entire wedding or photo shoot!  The quality of the photos are AWESOME!  One of the best things that made me buy this camera is the lenses to my other Nikon AF's fit this one (besides the fact I've been a long time Nikon fan).  I was a little skeptical about the price, but this has me convinced that there is nothing better than this camera.  With a 512 MB memory card, I can get over 150 of the finest quality pictures.  I print them out on my hp photosmart 1215 and they are perfect!  Add Photoshop, and we got game!!The battery on this seems to last forever!  I've done 2 photo shoots (with animals!) and played around with it quite a bit, and the battery is still at full level.  Instructions are easy to understand, it's easy to download, and it is just plain SWEET!I've still got a lot to discover with this camera, but so far, it's worth the money!  If you're a serious amature or a pro, this camera is the best.  I'm ready to get rid of the old "film cameras" and buy another one!

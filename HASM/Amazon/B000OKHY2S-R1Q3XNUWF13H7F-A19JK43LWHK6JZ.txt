Title: Who says it doesn't work?
Content:
I used the air cooler for about a week and it is terrific!
for those who says it does not cool down your room, it sure does not. It's a cooler not a conditioner!!
Read the product description before you buy it.
How good it is?
When i add ice and water and put a ice pouch on the top..it's chilling like an air conditioner!
when i just add water. It's cool like the ocean breeze but do not keep your windows or doors closed it will make you wet.
even when you don't add water and turn the cool air off..this thing blows out cooler air than normal fan.
So i give it 5 star. easy to use and easy to clean.

Title: light weight, flexible and good performance
Content:
We have purchased this model basically to enable younger members of the family to use the vacuum - uprights were just too heavy.
Model is light and easy to operate.
It works very well on the carpets, stair and furniture (hand held tool is good)
What we could wish for would be more suction on the hardwood surfaces.

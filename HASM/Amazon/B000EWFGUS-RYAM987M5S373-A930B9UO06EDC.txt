Title: Cheap...and Cheap!
Content:
Worked fine until I needed to take the lid off the carafe to run it thru the dishwasher, after which the top of the carafe could not be re-snapped into the carafe...and, with subsequent attempts, finally broke the plastic insets.  Now the carafe won't hold the lid.  Great!  New product, bad engineering, broken within a week.  Bad purchase!

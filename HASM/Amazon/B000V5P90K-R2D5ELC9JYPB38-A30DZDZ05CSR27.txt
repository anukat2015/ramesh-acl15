Title: A great all around camera/lens combination
Content:
I'm not going into all the lurid details, but this is a GREAT camera and the 28-135 IS is the lens I use day to day with it.  It gives a very good range of focal lengths and the IS feature helps with the camera shake at slow shutter speeds that all zoom lens suffer from.
My only caveat is that they're a bit heavy together.  Not nearly as bad as some though!
If you can't afford the 50D this is an amazing value and the images are superb.  I've printed up to 12x18 with this 10 Mpixel camera and had good results.  Depth of colour and sharpness are first rate.
I recommend it highly.

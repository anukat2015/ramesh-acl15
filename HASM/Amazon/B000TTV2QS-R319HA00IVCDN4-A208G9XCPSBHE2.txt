Title: Great Little Heater
Content:
I was looking for an additional heater and purchased this model based on customer reviews.  After a week of use I have nothing but positives to say about this device.  It is quiet, easy to move, settings are simple and easy to adjust, love the remote, and it heats really well.  Granted, I am not asking it to melt ice burgs, I am just want it to heat rooms by a reasonable  amount.  
The heater has been in our 13x18 bedroom all week and keeps it at a constant 70 at night, normally 63/64 without heater.  I moved it to our large open living room/kitchen and it had no trouble getting the entire room up from 67 to 72 and keeping it there.  This is a huge space open to main hallways so it took some time to heat up, but it kept the temperature at that level all day once there. This device exceeds my expectations!  You will have no trouble keeping a smaller space nice and cozy with this heater.

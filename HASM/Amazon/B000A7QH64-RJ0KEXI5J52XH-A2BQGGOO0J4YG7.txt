Title: NOT GOOD IN MY BOOK HERES WHY!
Content:
I BOUGHT THIS MARCH 3RD, USED IT TWICE, WENT TO CHARGE IT, AND IT WONT TAKE A CHARGE!
I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY ARE ALL INDIAN, AND YOU CANT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THEY SAY.
ANYWAY THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD SEND ME A NEW CHARGER, THAT WAS 4 WEEKS AGO, I HAVE CALLED 4 TIMES, THEY NOW TELL ME THEY DONT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL GET CHARGERS IN!
I AM AN ENGINEER, SO I GOT OUT MY TICK TRACER AND ITS SHOWING THERES CURRENT FROM THE CHARGER TO THE VACUUM, SO WHEN I TOLD THEM THIS, THEY SAID THAT IF THE CHARGER (WHICH THEY DONT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL GET) DOESNT WORK THEN CALL THEM AGAIN!
THEY ALSO TRIED TO MAKE ME PAY FOR A NEW CHARGER!
I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS UNIT TO MY WORST ENEMY.
CUSTOMER SERVICE STINKS, AND SO DO THIER REPS.
JUST WARNING YOU ALL, BECAUSE I BOUGHT THIS DUE TO ALL THE "SHINNING REVIEWS" ITS NOT WORTH IT IF IT DOESNT WORK.

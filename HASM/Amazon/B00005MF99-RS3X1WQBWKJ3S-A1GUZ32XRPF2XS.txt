Title: Save yourself the time, money and headaches
Content:
I am an avid coffee drinker and bought this machine with hopes of a dependable coffee maker in the morning.  What an absolute dissapointment!  The first time brewing the brew basket clogged creating quite a mess of coffee grounds.  Next effort produced quite a leaking problem.  The next morning the machine completely shorted out.  What an absolute waste of time and money.  My impressions of Black & Decker have been dropping over the years, but I thought "how can they mess up such a simple design?"  Surprise!  In my estimation, Black & Decker has reached a new low with inferior products.  Avoid this coffee maker and save yourself the headaches.

Title: Satisfied so far! :)
Content:
Ok. Our regular coffee maker broke so we went shopping for a new one. We decided to take a chance and purchase 
the B66 Keurig (from Sam's. Cheaper than Amazon's price btw). 
We've had it a few days and LOVE it so far! It is SUCH fun to now have so many different flavors and varieties of coffees, 
teas and hot chocolate K-cups to choose from. (The Sam's package comes with 72 K-cups in it). Now every day is a new
adventure in taste tests of different brands and flavors, lol. Now there is much less waste of coffee than using the 
regular coffee maker (we had a 4-cup maker and due to husband only drinking less than half a cup and me drinking one 
to two cups, coffe would get wasted). 
We also bought the 'My K-Cup' attachment (at Bed Bath and Beyond Stores for 15 bucks) and love THAT even more
so we can use our ground coffee or loose tea or hot cocoa powder as a regular day to day, (and cheaper) option. Every cup we've made so far (including
using the My K-Cup) brews the perfect cup! I think the machine is quiet and efficient. 
This will be a great conversation piece for parties and gatherings, but also good for individuals who may 
have varying tastes and don't like wasting coffee.

Title: 1st Generation Zune - Not even close
Content:
I've owned a 1st generation 30gb Zune since the first of 2008. I've applied all available software/firmware updates. It has more working against it than for it. But I use it everyday because I don't want to risk losing my iPod Touch.
The main complaints are the horrible software; the USB 1.1 transfer speed (takes literally hours to load movies); the lack of any ability to organize videos in any way and songs only into basic groups; the way it doesn't remember where you left off while listening to songs in a very long list; no way to delete files from collection but keep in player (deletes without asking when re-connecting); scrolling and more scrolling, clicking and more clicking (no shortcuts).
It's not all bad: Good audio quality; video is passable but nowhere near the Touch; good size and comfort; good battery.
Like I said, this is my everyday player but if I didn't have my iPod to fall back on, I'd be disappointed.

Title: Toshiba Satelite U505
Content:
Good: 
Nice looking.
Decent screen.
Lightweight.
eSATA port
OK:
Relatively quiet,
Bad:
Keyboard is ***BAD***.  Typing is at least 25% then on a good keyboard. Especially the space-bar is weak. Many times words flowtogetherintooneword, because the space bar did not register my strokes and I have to go back and separate them like this: "flow together into one word".
Mouse-pad somewhat bellow mediocre, too.
Stupid:
The shining LCD light above the mouse-pad and also above the keyboard.
There probably is a switch somewhere where I can turn it off (I hope, but I have not yet read the manual and don't know how, hopefully it can be turned off. But it is indeed stupid. It does not help to see the keys, on the contrary, it blinds one's eyes.
Would I buy it if I knew all this?
Unfortunately not. Keyboard while a very cheap part, is very important. I don't want to return it because I have spent a weak loading all my files and programs. I will buy and external keyboard.
I wish someone from Toshiba would read this and change their keyboards.

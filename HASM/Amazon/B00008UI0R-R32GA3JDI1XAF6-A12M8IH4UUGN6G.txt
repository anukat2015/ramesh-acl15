Title: Much better than an Oreck
Content:
This vacuum picked up dirt than my oreck hadn't been able to reach--talk about your deep cleaning power. I was also very impressed with the variable speed/suction power control--makes getting around power cords so much easier.
Year later update: still works great and was just told by a Lowes salesperson that no canister vac was as good as the uprights (was looking for replacement belts). I told him he was just flat out wrong. This hoover may be bulky because of the canister--but it cleans so deep down--it's worth it.

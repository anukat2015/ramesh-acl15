Title: GT 300 AWESOME COFFEE MAKER
Content:
The GT 300 is a great machine. I wanted a coffee maker that would make one cup of coffee for when I am in a rush to get to work and don't get going fast enough. :)  It makes enough to go in my travel mug and it's off to work I go.  With my GOURMET coffee. What could be better?  Not a whole lot, it makes my coffee fast and hot.  I also have the extra pod accessory so I can add my own coffee.  I love this coffee maker, even more than my 12 cup.  It makes NO MESS!  It is a neat little machine. I hope you like it as much as I do.

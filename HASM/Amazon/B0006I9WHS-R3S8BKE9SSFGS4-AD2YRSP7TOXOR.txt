Title: Thermostat limits performance near room temperature
Content:
The Honeywell HZ-315 Quick Heat Ceramic Heater is typical for products in its class. It consists of a heating element, a fan and a thermostat in a plastic housing (metal grill). 
Because it relies on a fan, it's fairly noisy, enough to be distracting if you're listening to music or other entertainment. It's a fairly "clean" white noise, not rattly.
The thermostat doesn't go up high enough, so the unit may shut off before you're ready.
The unit is compact: 7.5" high, 6.5" wide and about 6.5" deep not allowing for placement clearance.
I was able to operate the unit in a variety of positions, meaning the unit can run tipped over, though it seems to be stable and well balanced.
The advertising on the box says: "Quick Heat, Heats you warmer, faster*". The * refers to "Honeywell Test #SM-0102". Google and the Honeywell web site have yet to learn about SM-0102, so the question remains: Warmer, faster that WHAT?
Overall conclusion: This unit is much nicer than the noisy old coil heaters I grew up with. I would give the unit another star if the thermostat range went up 10F. I find KAZ's hype and lack of information annoying - Just give me the facts, please!

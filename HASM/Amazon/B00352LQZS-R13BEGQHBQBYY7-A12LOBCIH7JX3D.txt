Title: first notebook
Content:
This is the first notebook I have purchased so maybe my experience (or lack of) is affecting my review.  One of the reasons I got it was to replace my older desktop, which the Asus does a great job at for a notebook.  It is larger than many other models an offers plenty of screen and key board space, it is quite at home on my desk.  But I also wanted the versatility of being able to travel with it, and if you don't mind lugging around close to ten pounds it does that as well.  The problem with going mobile is the battery life, you only get about 1.5 hours before the battery warning comes on.  I compromised this feature for all the other great features it does have: crisp, clear and large screen; blistering fast speed, great sound; solid build.  All in all it is a great notebook but not sure if it is worth the money at over $1000.00 with so many others available at far less, but again I haven't experienced them either so maybe not.  I am happy with mine and would recommend it to anyone that can afford it and is not looking for the best value neccessarily, just looking for the best.

Title: Junk
Content:
You would be better off buying a simple single or double burner infrared bottle mounted heater. I had my Mr Heater just over a year before I trashed it in frustration!!!!! It would go off for no reason and the many parts that make it function also make it susceptible to any little dust particle that may clog the system and there is no way to bleed the lines to get rid of air in the lines so you may spend quite a bit of time trying to get it to light. A big thumbs down I did feel a lot better when I slammed it in my trash can

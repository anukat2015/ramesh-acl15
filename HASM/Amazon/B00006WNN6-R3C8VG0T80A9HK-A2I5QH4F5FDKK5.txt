Title: I love my little heater
Content:
I keep the heater on my desk and it works great.  It puts out enough heat for me to feel cozy at work.  I don't think it would be so great in a large area, but for what I need/want it for, it's perfect.  
My old heater started making a scary noise and I junked it.  When I first got this DeLonghi heater, I was a little disappointed because the heat wasn't as strong as my old heater.  But, then I remembered I would have to move the old heater away from me frequently because it would start cooking me!  So, throughout the day, I would have to move the old one towards me and away from me, towards me and then later away from me.  The DeLonghi heater gives me a nice, steady comfortable warmth the whole time I have it on.
I've had it for 3 months and use it for several hours 5X a week, and I'm very happy with it.

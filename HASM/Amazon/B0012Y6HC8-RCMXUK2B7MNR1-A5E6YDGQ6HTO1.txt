Title: Very poor autofocus and noise performance
Content:
This might be a quality control issue but about 50% of my shots are out of focus. I have used a 350D for years and was planning to upgrade to 12 MP - but I am very disappointed. I am always using center point autofocus and have used several different lenses - Canon's 50mm/f1.8, the Canon 17-85mm IS, Sigma 10-20mm, Sigma 30mm/f1.4 - with all lenses there are focus issues in many many shots.
In addition, I can not attest to the low noise comments. I see lots of chroma noise even at ISO 400 which was never the case with my 8 MP 350D. This one is going back today - I guess Canon has serious quality control issues, though the noise issue can not be explained by that.

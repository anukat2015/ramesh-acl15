Title: Don't Buy This Piece of ****!
Content:
I am very dissapointed in Cuisinart.  I read the reviews that said it was hard to clean before I bought the machine and I thought - oh those people are just complaining - I can clean anything and it won't take me as long as others are saying.  Well - everyone who rates this machine very low is right. It makes an incredible mess of coffee sludge.  The grind part won't even come out of the machine, and I have had the door open many times with coffee and coffee grounds all over my white tile countertops.  Try to get that out of white grout! 
Do not buy this machine.  On their website, Cuisinart doesn't even give you a number to phone and make a complaint.  They just want you to buy their products - with no customer support.  I will never buy anything Cuisinart again!!!!!!!!!

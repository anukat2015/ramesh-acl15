Title: Nearly as good as my old 5.5 gen.
Content:
I got the 16gb ipod touch last summer, when it was the largest ipod available. I am extremely impressed with its durability, the chrome backing is absolutly torn to shreds (Ditch the chrome backplate apple) and its been dropped and kicked and scraped all over the place. I highly reccomend buying the 2.0 update. its well worth it. The apps available make the ipod touch a truly enjoyable product. That being said, i believe the 5.5 gen. was the best ipod ever made. But after it was stolen from my locker at the gym, i decidded to go all gimmicky and get the ipod touch. Aside from the fact that you cant download java player for a hightened online experience, this is one hell of an ipod, and its not fragile at all. This thing is an 8 millimeter thin tank.

Title: Stunning Improvement Over Canon Point-and-Shoot
Content:
I initially held off buying a SLR, not so much because of
the expense, but because I did not want to be confronted with
the complexity of the different control options.  I was using
a Canon A-590, which is an 8 MP point-and-shoot.  The A590
is a great camera which gives excellent results.
I have had the Xsi for about a month now, and was surprised
to find that in the full auto mode its even easier to use
than the A-590.  If you are intimidated from purchasing a
SLR by the bewildering complexity of control options, don't
be.  You don't have to use them if you don't want to.
What has really stunned me, though, is the astonishing
improvement in image quality with the Xsi.  I compared
it directly to the A-590 and found a staggering improvement
in detail and resolution.  This difference goes far beyond
what could possibly be attributed to the slight advantage
the Xsi has in the number of pixels (12 MP vs. 8 for the A-590).
So, the Xsi is highly recommended for taking stunning 
photographs, far higher in quality than a cheaper point-and-shoot
with the same specified resolution.

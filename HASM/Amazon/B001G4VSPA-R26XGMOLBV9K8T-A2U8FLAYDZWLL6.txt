Title: Save Your Natural Gas $$
Content:
Purchased this unit at Costco for $54.99 5 days ago.  The target room for the unit is 18X15.  Using the unit on the low setting with the thermostat turned all the way to the right, it took 30 or so minutes to change the room temperature by 5 degrees.  Impressive!
Pros:  Extremely quiet, slim design, ceramic=safer than oil filled, designed for long-term use, tip over heater turns off, lightweight and portable.
Cons: No dial to choose temperature in degrees, no timer.
I highly recommend it for spot heating when you don't want to over use your furnace when you only use a smaller area of the house.

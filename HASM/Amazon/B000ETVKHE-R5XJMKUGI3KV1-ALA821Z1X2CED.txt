Title: Great iPod alternative
Content:
Didn't know what to expect at first since I had bad luck with a cheap Chinese iPod clone but I read all the reviews here and decided to take a chance. Well now I see what all the raves were about! I am totally impressed with my new toy! I put the majority of my favorite songs, some you tube videos, some video podcasts and a slew of pictures and I still have over 2gigs left, with the capability of expansion with the SD slot. The photo quality is superb, videos are clear and totally watchable despite the somewhat small screen. Pictures can be put on a slideshow while you listen to your favorite playlists. Battery life is excellent and cheap USB chargers are available for under $20 which is something you may want to consider for travelling, otherwise the USB computer port works fine. Sound quality is superb also and it is very user-friendly. I have only two complaints, one is with the operating/conversion software which I had to download and the metal back developed a slight discoloration perhaps due to perspiration. Really helps pass the time on airline flights and bus/train trips. I highly recommend it and it's priced right too.

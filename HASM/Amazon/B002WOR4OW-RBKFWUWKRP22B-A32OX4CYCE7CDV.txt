Title: Don't buy
Content:
I purchased a G72GX and in two days it crashed. Tried calling customer support and emailing with no result. Took it back to the store  where they tested it and advised it had a software problem. I exchanged it for a new modle. The new one started acting just like the old one with screen lock up and "Not Responding" message. After 10 days this unit lost wireless capabilities then crashed. Erased all I had loaded on it and would only come up in safe mode. Couldn't change to normal mode at all. Called the Geek squad and was advised to return the laptop to where I purchased it and exchange it for a different brand. Come to find out the store had pulled all of G72GX units due to poor performance issues and exchanges.
Geek Squad advised ASUS was not a reliable brand and had many issues.

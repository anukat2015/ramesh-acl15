Title: Mr. Heater is the MAN!
Content:
IMO, nobody does small heaters better than Mr.Heater.I live in a total electric house in rural West Virginia. In the effort of being prepared for a power outage, I have decided to go with propane as my back up heat sorce. Since buying the Big Buddy, I have not suffered a power outage. Though I do turn my thermostat down as I leave my home for the day. In the evenings when I get back I usually fire up the Big Buddy between 4,000 to 9,000 BTU while the furnace is trying to warm up the house. It makes a huge difference in taking the work load off of my electric furnace in trying to get the temperature to an acceptable level in the house. I have a larger 20,000 BTU ventless space heater, and think that the Big Buddy is almost as effective. Between the two propane heaters I have no worries that my home will stay nice and warm even when the electricity is out.
I don't think that I would run the Big Buddy on 18,000 BTUs to long with out a protective mat to keep some of the heat off my linoleum. 9,000 gets it pretty warm. I bought the power adapter so I wouldn't have to keep batteries on hand. The fan does help move the air into the heated area, but I think it is almost as effective without it. I also bought the EZ Fill Propane Coupler. I have about 15 1 lb bottles. I decided it would be best for me to refill small bottles instead of hooking the heater to a 20lb cylinder.
The Buddy Heaters are the way to go, if you are looking for something compact, but effective. I have used lesser BTU rated heaters, and seem to get way more fumes, with less fuel efficiency.

Title: Best Heater Ever
Content:
This is the best heater hands down. It is EASY to use, does what is says it will do and is Energy Efficient. It gets very hot on low and the range of motion with the low swing oscillation is great. It is QUIET!!!!  And the best part is no blowing air.  And it adds a nice glow to a room.  When I set the timer, the heat remains for a long time after it shuts off.  I researched, purchased,returned and used almost every type of heater from the vornado to a holmes...This one is the best..it is a keeper.

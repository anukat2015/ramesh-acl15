Title: A fun DSLR!!
Content:
This was my first DSLR. I will remain an amateur photographer but this opens ups avenues I never could enjoy with point & shoots and my old 35mm SLR!!
I purchased Olympus Evolt E520 10MP Digital SLR Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 and 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 ED Zuiko Lenses and got the free 12 month interest free deal using the Amazon store card.
I also purchased from Amazon: Lexar Professional Series 8 GB 300x UDMA CompactFlash Memory Card as I figured why skimp on the media with a nice camera; the Olympus FR-36R Flash; the Olympus QuickPro E-520 DVD; an extra Olympus BLM-01 Lithium-ion Rechargeable Battery because why find you ran out of power at the wrong time; the Sto-Fen OMNI-BOUNCE OM-600 - Flash diffuser; a Lowepro Nova 200 AW Camera Bag; Zeikos High Resolution 3-piece Filter Set (UV, Fluorescent, Polarizer) for the Olympus E-520 and finally Olympus M+ 2 GB xD-Picture Card Flash Memory Card as the camera can hold CF and xD at the same time (nice to have a back up to the CF!).
The camera bag hold all that plus a small gorilla tripod!
This camera is just so much fun I hope my computer and computer external drive can store all the shots I am getting!
I hope Olympus comes out for some more lenses for the camera in the standard price line.
I really studied a lot of sites on cameras and understood that Cannon and Nikon are the market leaders. However, I got my Olympus Camera with two lenses at a very competitive price from Amazon. While professional photography editors may opine on the nuances between the brands, I just felt my 'all-in' package would serve my just as well and it does!
If I could, I would have uploaded a picture I took with the camera.
I have a lot to learn but I am pleased with the product and performance of this camera!

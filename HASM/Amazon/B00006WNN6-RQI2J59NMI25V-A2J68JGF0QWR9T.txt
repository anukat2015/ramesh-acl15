Title: Works Great But Fan Won't Shut Off
Content:
This is a great unit, especially for the price.  However, it just started malfunctioning (used for 2 months) and now the fan will not shut off unless you unplug the unit.  It sounds like the thermostat switch has gone bad.  Still heats great though -- you just now have to ALWAYS unplug the unit, otherwise the fan keeps running.  No response as of yet from Delonghi and the store where I purchased it will not exchange it as it's beyond their 30-day time period for exchanges.

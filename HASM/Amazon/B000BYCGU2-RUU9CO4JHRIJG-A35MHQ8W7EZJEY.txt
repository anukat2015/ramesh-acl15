Title: Nearly ideal
Content:
I had this coffeemaker for 2 weeks already. I have a Capresso coffee grinder for a few years and never had problems with it - decided to give their coffeemaker a try. The styling is superb and the controls are effortless and intuitive. The programming works great, and the clock is plainly visible even when the kitchen is brightly lit. There is no innate problem with an overflow, as long as you won't go over the "max" marking on a side. The red indicator ball, albeit small is clearly observable.  
The machine makes very good coffee, and even though the liquid temperature is fine by me, it's not brewing as hot as my old Cusinart used to. That's not a defect in my opinion, because it's still hot enough to wait a couple of minutes before talking your first morning sip. I don't bother with a water filter, because I only use bottled water, however I do grind my coffee and try to get only the best beans. For about $190.00 I may've expected a bit more for the money, but I'm not disappointed and will recommend it.

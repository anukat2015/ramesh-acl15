Title: Difficult to use
Content:
We have had trouble with it dropping the internet and freezing up. HP has been helpful but it is a pain to spend an hour ever few days to get it up and running again. I thought it would be fast and it isn't fast at all. I have other computers in the house that run much better so I don't think it is anything that I am doing.

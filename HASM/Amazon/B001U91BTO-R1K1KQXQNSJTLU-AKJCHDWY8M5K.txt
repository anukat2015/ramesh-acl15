Title: ideal vacuum cleaner
Content:
Since we have wooden floors through out, I bought this vacuum cleaner for the rugs. Suction is good and adjustable. This vacuum cleaner is light, easy to carry stairs up and down. The big wheels are a good design feature, it makes it easy to move around when using. I have had it over a year now, and I am still content with this cleaner. The only drawback are the bags, they are not cheap.

Title: Will never buy a HP product again!
Content:
I bought this computer three years ago and it has been giving me trouble for almost the entire time.  
The picture and sound quality are really the only things good about this pc.  This computer is ideal for watching movies.
The adapter is HORRIBLE.  The cord of the adapter keeps breaking (it actually almost caught on fire once) and I've had to replace it FOUR TIMES.
Additionally, the computer gets very hot pretty quickly.  I've had it shut on me so often, these days even when the pc isn't hot.  I'm so frustrated with this product that I will never buy a HP product of any kind again.

Title: Different then the B70
Content:
I give this 3 stars just because it is a Keurig and the single serve system is great. 
I do however have a beef with this model. Not only is it more expensive than your BJ's or Costco it also lacks certain features you get when you purchase the B70 model. I just bought mine at BJ's and I am returning it to purchase a B70 model. 
The differences are:
B70 ( Platinum )
Cup sizes up to 12oz
Adjustable Temp
Lacks the 72 K-Cups instead you get 12.
B77 ( Select )
Stops at 10oz
No Adjustable Temp.
Bonus 72 K-Cups instead of the 12.
If you don't care much for the differences then the extra K-cups might make it worth the buy. I would still suggest you get it from BJ's or Costco since this price is $30 more here than they have it for.
I wanted the 12oz so I decided to forgo the extra k-cups and I am going for the B70 (Platinum).

This heater does a fantastic job!  I live in an older home built in the 30's.  The insulation is not so good.  The living area I have been heating is about 800 sq ft.  I purchased 2 of these heaters and could not be more pleased.
Last year I used a gas log fireplace along with a central heating unit.  I was still cold, so I purchased a ceramic room heater.  It ran all the time and there was still a chill in the room.  For the last 2 months, I turn the logs on and get the temp up to about 74 then turn off the logs.  I turn these 2 delonghi heaters on and they go as the stand alone heat source for most of the day. The temp stays at about 70. I don't need any type of humidifier to moisten the air, it is just a comfortable, warm heat.  I have hardly used any heating fuel and the electric bill is extremely reasonable.  I can't recommend this unit enough.  I have pets and no problem there either.  It gets warm to the touch, but not dangerously so.  They are sturdy units and haven't tipped over nor do I fear they will.  I am going to save a lot of money on heating my home this winter and I'm going to be a whole lot warmer in the process.  Give this heater a try, you won't regret it!

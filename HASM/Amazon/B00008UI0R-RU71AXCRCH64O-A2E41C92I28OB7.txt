Title: A nice Surprise
Content:
I found this vacuum VERY easy to operate.  I love the fact that the main canister filter and the HEPA filter are both "WASHABLE" so as long as you take care of them, they should last as long as the vacuum.  Strong suction (this vacuum REALLY sucks!!! and that's good). My vacuum came with the optional furniture attachment and the hard floor attachment.  The canister is EASY to empty and it separates the dirt the fibers (light stuff on top and heavier dirt on the bottom), it seems to help keep the air flow going.   I have owned ONLY uprights until now, and LOVE this vacuum.

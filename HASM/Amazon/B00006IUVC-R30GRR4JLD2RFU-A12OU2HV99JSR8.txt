Title: An avid coffee consumer
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a gift from my mother.  Upon using it the first time I was disappointed to see that only 4 cups of coffee made it into the pot.  I found the rest of it on the counter.  I have examined the maker and found that it is leaking from the bottom of the water resivour somewhere.  This happens each time no matter how many cups I try and make.  I cant return the maker as I have not recipt and mom lives out of state and has not kept the recipt.  Tast of the coffe that I get is great.  Feel this is a bad designe or I got a lemon and am stuck with it.

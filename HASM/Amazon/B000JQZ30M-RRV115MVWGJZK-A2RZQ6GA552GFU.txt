Title: Great for small rooms
Content:
Love this heater, works great for my home office space which is a 10x11 room; lightweight and decorative, works in any room of the house appearance wise.  Often I will move it to larger rooms, doesn't heat up an entire large room but has sufficient heat output to take the chill off even in the bigger rooms...for the money it was a great investment.

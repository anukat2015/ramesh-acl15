Title: Dirt Devil Featherlite: Hose adapter to base unit easily cracks
Content:
Good buy for the price, but the hose adapter to the base unit easily cracks.  The adapter is so flimsy and is weakened from holes for the latching, that it cracks after few uses and then pieces fall off so that it can't retain the connection during use.

Title: very good product at a very good price
Content:
I like this product.  The complaints about having a small dirt storage container and not tracking well when you pull it around by the hose are valid but it does clean very well.  I have no problem with the controls or the handle (something others have noted problems with).  I have two small concerns about this product;  the cord is not long enough and the vacuum will not fit on a stair when I am doing them (have to set the vacuum on the top and bottom landings to do the stairs).  It has great suction power and is easy to use.  PS:  One benefit of buying it from Amazon was Amazon's price was $100 cheaper than what the local vacuum cleaner shops wanted to charge for it.  Shipping was fast and it arived well packaged.  The packaging was a good thing as the shipping box was damaged at delivery but the vacuum itself was just fine.  Very good buying experience for a very good product.

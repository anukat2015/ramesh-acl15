Title: HP Pavilion DV7 --Great Laptop
Content:
This is the second 17.3" Pavilion I have purchased, the first one is a year old, not a single problem. So far the build quality appears to be excellent and the price competitive for this class of laptop. The battery life is good as well as the WiFi which allows me to use the PC anywhere in the house with no communication problems. Amazon had the best price and as always delivered ahead of their promised date.

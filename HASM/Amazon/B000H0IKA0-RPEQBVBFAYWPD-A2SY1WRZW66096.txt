Title: Excellent Value, for a Little Guy
Content:
I received this for my birthday and have used it for a week now.  The most difficult part of set up was getting it out of the box.  After that, it was so simple you mom may be able to do it all on her own.  I was very surprised at the volume and clarity for such a small item.  Fun and easy!

Title: Don't waste your money
Content:
Unless you like cold coffee, this coffee maker is pretty much useless.  Machine functions as do most except there is no heat plate to keep carafe warm.  And the carafe does not keep the coffee warm but for a few minutes.  Even if you preheat the carafe, which is a nuisance and waste of water and energy, the coffee is still cool within minutes.  One must also use a measuring cup for water to accurately determine the number of cups to be brewed as the carafe has no markings for number of cups. Again, a nuisance.  Useless and worthless.

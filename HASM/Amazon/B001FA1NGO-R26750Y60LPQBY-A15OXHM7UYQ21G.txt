Title: Very pleased - excellent product
Content:
Purchased this for my nine year old daughter, she has had no issue figuring our how to use it (I load the music for her using iTunes). I limited the volume to ensure her ears are not hurt and this feature is password protected so she can't undo my settings. I'm very pleased with the quality of the product. The shake to shuffle feature is great.

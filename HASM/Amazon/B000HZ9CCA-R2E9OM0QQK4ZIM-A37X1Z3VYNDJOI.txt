Title: Sansa e280 review
Content:
The e200 series of sansa is a set of players that are easy to operate, have sleek design and good sound quality.
It's main disadvantage is that it has a low volume output.
I would recommend anyone that is sick of the limitation i-pod world dictates to consider the sansa player as a great alternative.

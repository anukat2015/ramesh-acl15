Title: Safe and Effective
Content:
We were looking for a safe, energy efficient heater, to run in our bedrooms (2) at night eliminating the use of our furnace.  This has been the perfect choice.  We have a 1 year old and this heater is NOT hot to the touch when running, tip over protection, shuts off after running 4 hours continuously.  I love the 4 hour shutoff.  If you keep the bedroom door closed, the heat generated in those 4 hours is enough to keep you warm until morning- big savings on heat/electricity.
IF your looking for continuous very hot heat, this is not the unit for you.  Blows continuous warm air....and it does the trick!

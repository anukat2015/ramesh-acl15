I wish I could be more useful in this review, but I purchased this product as a gift for my daughter, who is very computer literate. She reports to me that she "loves" this laptop! What's important about this is that she has previously owned at least two other laptops and two desktops, all PCs, and all of which she gives quite a workout. Thus far, she reports liking the Acer better than her previous Dells, Asus, and Gateway products. All but the Gateway gave her good performance and good service. But she likes the performance and features of the Acer Aspire best of all. She also has good things to say about Windows 7. Just for the record, I am a user of both PCs (Dell & HP) and Macs. I am typing this review on my Macbook 13 inch, by far my favorite computer. My next purchase will be an iMac.

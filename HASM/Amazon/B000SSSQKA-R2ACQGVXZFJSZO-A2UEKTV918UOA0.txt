Title: Expected something better
Content:
Based on other reviews I thought I was getting a small, good quality vacuum cleaner. I was very disappointed when I first turned it on. Even though it has very good sucktion it doesn't pick up small pieces from my rug. I have to bend and remove them manually. It takes me three times longer to clean the rug than it used to with the old one. I'm giving it one star for being very operable. Besides that it doesn't function as it's described.

Title: Waste of $100
Content:
I'll split this review into two parts, the vacuum and the water cleaner.
The Vacuum:  Embarassingly pitiful suction, no rotating brush, and the machines sticks on the squeege from the water cleaning side making a back and forth cleaning motion difficult.  This vacuum couldn't pick up small dustballs, little scraps of paper, or loose dirt.  The suction part of it is so far back that it's impossible to get into corners or near edges of walls and no attachment to supplement.
The water cleaner:  Pitiful. Uneven distribution of water, uneven suction of water, the brush falls out any time you move the machine from left to right even gently, and the brush was almost spotless after 15 minutes of cleaning on 'heated' mode with floors that hadn't been mopped in 2 weeks.  The 'heater' fails to  produce even tepid water.  The squeege leaves puddles every time you pull back and any small variation in your floor will leave large streaks of water.  On my tile floor it left puddles in all of the grout.  Water in the 'dirty' water collection bin was as clean as the water coming out of the cleaning solution compartment.  The cleaning pad is in the dead center of the machine's base, so you can't clean within 2 inches of the wall going front to back, and more than an inch going sideways.  The really sad sight was how dirty the mop water was after I turned off this garbage and cleaned my floor the old fashioned way.
Horrible design, worse functioning.  This machine took more time and did a worse job cleaning than a $5 broom and $10 mop.

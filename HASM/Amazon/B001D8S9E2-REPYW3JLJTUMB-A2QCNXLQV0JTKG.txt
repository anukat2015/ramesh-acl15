Title: Most Excellent
Content:
What's not to like?  Perfect size for traveling.... lots of speed, memory and a nice size hard drive.  Runs cool and the battery life is great.  The aluminum chassis is easy to keep looking new and feels rock solid.  The screen resolution and clarity is awesome...  
Cons:   None that I have found at this point....

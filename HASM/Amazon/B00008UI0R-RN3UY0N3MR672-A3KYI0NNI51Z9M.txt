Title: Small but Powerful
Content:
This vacuum is amazing. I have two of the hairiest dogs man has ever seen and the s3765 has done an amazing job staying on top of that hair. We had bought a $450 Dyson vacuum and that was terrible it would get loose hair off the carpet but it did not really clean . We returned that and got this vacuum and WOW. Thanks to all the people that reviewed this product before me . This has to be the best all around vacuum ever!

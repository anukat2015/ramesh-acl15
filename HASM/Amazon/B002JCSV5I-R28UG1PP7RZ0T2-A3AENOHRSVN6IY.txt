Title: Poor Quality Control - See Dirt/Hair Thru Viewfinder
Content:
Dirt or what looks to be a hair can be seen when looking thru viewfinder(not rear LCD screen). While this does not show up on picture nonetheless it is distracting when looking thru viewfinder and is unacceptable for a brand new out of the box camera. Annoying thing is that I recieved two of these cameras in a row with this same problem(1st from original order and 2nd a replacement for 1st). Therefore I really have to question Nikon's quality control and inspection standards. Too bad focusing screen can not be taken out so as to clean pentaprism and topside of screen. Most film cameras allowed this and some other DSLR's allow this. Calling Nikon about this was like talking to a wall. Really bad customer service. I want to note though that Amazon service has been great.

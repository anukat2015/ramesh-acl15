Title: Good Service but incorrect display by Amazon
Content:
The review of the seller - good service - I received this coffee maker within 3 days of my order - great service.  The review of Amazon - not so great in this instance.  My original search was for coffee makers with grinder, so my assumption (my fault) was that the 10 that displayed had grinders on them.  Not so; when I went to wrap this gift, I didn't see 'grinder' on the box so additional search on Goggle provided this model did not have a grinder.  I contacted the seller (3 tries) but finally was able to get the information necessary to return the product.  Once I had that information, the return and credit for the return went smoothly althought not for the entire amount of my purchase.  I paid for the shipping to return the item, but then didn't receive the total amount of my purchase from the seller.  Shopping online didn't prove to be any time or money saver in this instance.  I did not attempt another purchase through Amazon as Christmas was coming and I needed the gift so I bought it locally at about the same price I would have paid on Amazon.  Lesson learned - online shopping doesn't replace hands on, take the time shopping that is needed to avoid returns. Time is money, yes, but time not spent can also be costly.

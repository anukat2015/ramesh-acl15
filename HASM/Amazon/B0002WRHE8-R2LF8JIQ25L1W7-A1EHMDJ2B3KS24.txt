Title: The Best Of The Best
Content:
This Is A great Little heater. You can use it with 1 LB cylinders or 40 lb tank. And you don't need a regulater like most heaters becouse there is one built in side. If you  reed the manual you will see this. You do have the option of using a quick disconect hose and with this you do need a regulater. witch is in the manual. and a filter for the oily resdue. also most heaters ask for a 100 lb tank only no less. with this buddy heater  you can use one 20 lb tank or two 20 lb tanks. I use one 40 lb. Also i see some reviewers say thay don't like it becouse it don't last long using the 1 lb cylinders witch is true. but thats why thay call it the portable Buddy. There is a fitting called a ( MAC COUPLER) that screws on the 20 or 40 lb tanks to refill those cylinders and save moneyMac Coupler Propane Refill Adapter $2.99 shipping.

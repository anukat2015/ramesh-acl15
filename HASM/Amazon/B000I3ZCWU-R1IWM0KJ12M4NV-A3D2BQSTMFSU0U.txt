Title: A great entry into digital slrs.
Content:
I've had this camera now for about a month. It's an exellent camera for entry-level users and will have some longevity. The lens selection is well supported. It's a bit small but I really like it that way because it's easier to move about without distracting your subjects. Great image quality at 10.1 MP and the internal cleaning system is an exellent feature to this camera. If you're on the fence then I suggest  buying this camera.

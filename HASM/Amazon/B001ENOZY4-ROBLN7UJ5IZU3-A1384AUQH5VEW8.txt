Title: Great camera - highly recommend
Content:
This camera has more features and capabilities than you will ever need! Fortunatley it takes great photos in automatic mode too! The 18-105 lens is useful for almost any situation. I also bought the 300 lens, but rarely use it. Before you buy a DSLR though, I suggest you consider how you will use it. My best photos are spontaneous pics taken with my Olympus Stylus 710 or Nikon Coolpix. I can always have one of these cameras with me, and can be taking pictures in an instant. The DSLRs are bulky and usually in the carrying case in the car or at home. It takes a few minutes to get it ready unless you already have it out on a picture-taking expedition. I always have one of the compacts with me, and the D90 nearby.
While you are buying, I suggest you go ahead and get a good carrying case or backpack, basic UV filter to protect the lens, and a lens cleaning kit. Also suggest you go for the larger memory card...8G plus if you can.
I almost went for the D5000 because it has some neat features not found on the D90, but at the end of the day I felt like the D90 was more robust, and had a better feel to it. I also considered the Canon TSi, but again felt the D90 was a better constructed camera. (the Canon lenses didn't seem to operate as smoothly or precisely as the Nikon's)
I've had my D90 for a little over a month, have taken lots of great photos, and do not regret spending the extra $!

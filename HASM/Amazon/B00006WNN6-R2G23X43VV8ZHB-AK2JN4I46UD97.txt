Title: Delongi space heater
Content:
keeps cycling off even when turned to the highest setting, guess is a safety feature, but still leaves area cold at times before cycling on again.  Probably needed a stronger one even though we wanted something safe and small.  
I don't understand why it cycles off when the area is still pretty cold.  Still, it is really the only one that would fit safely where we are using it.

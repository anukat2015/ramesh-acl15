Title: Great Upgrade from Rebel XT
Content:
I looked at the 50D, the Rebel T1i, and the 7D.  Although I was very tempted by the 7D I could not justify the price premium in my mind.  The controls are easier to operate and the LCD panel on the top of the camera that gives you all of the settings is what swayed me from the T1i.  It feels great in the had and the weather sealing is a big plus, you also get lots more control and settings than in the Rebel line.  This is a great camera and a very good upgrade for me.
If you have the funds the 7D has a lot more features and seems worth it, but for someone like me, an amateur who just is really starting to get more serious, it was just too much at this stage.
I could not be happier.  Additionally, I purchased the GGS DSLR LCD Optical Glass Screen Protector for Canon EOS 50D Mark II Digital SLR Cameras to protect the GREAT 3 inch screen on the back (I damaged my screen on the Rebel and really had issues seeing the info on the LCD), and would definitely recommend this as an accessory.

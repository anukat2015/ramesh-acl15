Title: Great vacuum for small apartment
Content:
I was looking for a small vacumm for my one bedroom apartment in the mid-west and after doing a lot of research, I purchased this one.  It's working out great.  I didn't realize my carpets were so dirty until I used it and saw what was in the dirt canister.  It seems to have really good suction with both the powered carpet brush and the hard surface attachment. At my other home, which is a small condo out west, I have had a Dyson Canister Vacuum for about four years which I like very much.  This vacumm works as well if not better for a lot less money.  The only other difference is the Hoover needs a little more room than the Dyson to store it.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
I was very disappointed in my Pavilion because this was the first HP product that has given me trouble.  It arrived in good condition because it was well packed.  In a short time I had it up and running.  At this point a five star rating.  However, the next day when I tried to boot it up, nothing happened.  After HP tech support  (somewhere in deepest India) couldn't solve the problem, he started giving me instructions on how to send it in for repairs.  I told the tech that I didn't buy a reconditioned computer.  I wanted a new one.  He said no company would exchange this dud for a new computer.  Since I knew better, I just humored this fellow (whom I could hardly understand) and listened to him explain when the container in which the computer would be sent back would arrive.  I called Amazon.com, explained the situation, and received credit for the purchase before the box from HP arrived.  The one star rating is for this particular computer.  This one just happened to be a dud.  I rate HP products very high generally.  I also give Amazon.com a five star rating the way they handeled this transaction. By the way, I would give the HP tech a zero rating for his mastery of speaking the English language.

Title: great when it works. . .
Content:
I bought this mp3 on Amazon back in late March '09.  I was looking an mp3 with FM radio and since Sony is suppose to be good, I bought this model.  It's great. . . FM radio pretty good.  My own music pretty good.  I even downloaded some podcasts from NPR.  Loved it. . . until today. 
I called the Sony Customer service and they said it would need to sent in to fix which would be $77.00!!!  I just bought this in March.  When this mp3 works, it is great.  If you are willing to pay $90 for several months of use, I would recommend this mp3.

Title: It will capture the beauty of the world around you.
Content:
I have photographed from earthly little creatures to amazing bodies of heavenly magnitude (see the ladybug and the moon photograph in the "share your costumer images" file, for example) and I can't help the thought that this is what art-photography is all about! I am no pro. I have no photography background. All I have is just a strong desire to capture the beauty of the world around me and my Olympus Evolt E500 does the job perfectly. Try it! You will be delighted.

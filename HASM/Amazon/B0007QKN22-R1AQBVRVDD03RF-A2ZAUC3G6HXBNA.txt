Title: DSLRs; worth every penny of the extra hundred or so you spend
Content:
I researched DSLRs for the last year before choosing the Canon; I had a Fuji finepix that I loved, but I wanted something more advanced now that I know what I am doing with a digital camera.  I also wanted speed; my son plays soccer and football and the regular digitals are too slow for fast-moving bodies.  So far, I am extremely pleased with the fast-action sports photos I have taken.  After playing with the camera for a few months and reading the manual thoroughly, I realized using the manual Tv mode outdoors and setting the shutter speed to around 1600, I get crystal clear, "action" photos so detailed you can sometimes see the letters on the ball and the dirt flying up, etc.  With the shutter speed set at that speed or even a little lower, I can still take multiple pictures per second like in the sports mode, but much clearer and crisper.  I will never buy a regular digital camera again after having a DSLR;  I also purchased the 55-250 IS lens for the further away shots, and I feel that the lens is a must-have for anyone who wants to take great shots from a distance.  So far, so good!

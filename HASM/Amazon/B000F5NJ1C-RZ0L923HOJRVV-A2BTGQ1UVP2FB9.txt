Title: Pretty good for a cheap MP3 player
Content:
I've had a chance to use it for a month, and remembered to update the firmware to the latest version from the Archos website. (N.B. you really should do this first, after saving the files, because I found that the internal disk needed to be reformatted after the firmware upgrade).
The unit behaves as advertised and the UI is reasonably snappy (when it's not waiting for a 2-second disk spin-up). The OLED display is almost usable in bright sunlight, but adequate everywhere else; photos are a bit grainy on it. I bought the unit for its bookmarking capability, which works exactly as it should. The separate charger input is very handy when not around a computer -- the power jack matches the plug-and-voltage of many wall-warts being made today. File write speed to the unit is about 1 MB/s, not unreasonable.
Biggest complaints: The firmware sometimes falls down on certain files, seeming to "hang" while reading them for a long time. Archos decided to make this unit run on closed-source firmware, so future fixes for this misbehavior are highly unlikely.
I gave it 4 stars because it does nearly all of what's promised, for a cheap package; and because I have the perspective of using some truly badly-designed personal electronics in the past.

Title: Loud, finicky thermostat will return..
Content:
i bought this unit based on the positive reviews about this fan being fairly quiet and the temperature regulator feature but as soon as i saw the remote and plugged the unit i was very skeptical and well, it did not meet my expectations. 
first, the fan on the unit only has 1 setting and its LOUD. The 2 quiet settings is probably just a marketing come on for potential buyers but it does not really exist. Instead the "HI" and "LOW" settings is for the power it consumes/uses. I'm not exaggerating the noise level at all. It drowns out both the ceiling fan and the stand fan I had turned on to test the effectiveness of the temperature regulation feature which by the way jumps from 67 degrees to 79 degrees within a few seconds.
I'm enthusiastic about updated appliances that incorporates today's technology as I'm an avid DIY'er, professional engineer and circuit designer but it is just disappointing when I come across a like this that barely performs it's advertised features. 
This is one appliance that cannot do it's job properly and is something that i would not recommend.

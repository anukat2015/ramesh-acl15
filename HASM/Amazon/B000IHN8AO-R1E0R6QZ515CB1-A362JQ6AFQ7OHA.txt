Title: Delighted
Content:
I have had this product for just 1 month now but have been delighted with the performance and quality. A key driver for me in selecting this product is that I have used Pentax for many years so the ability to continue to use the range of lenses and other accesories was important. I am happy to say these have all worked well.  I have used non SLR digital cameras over the last couple of years and the key frustration for me has been the speed of focus and taking multiple shots at sporting events. I am delighted that those days of frustration are gone.  There are many features I am yet to investigate but am happy to say the camera has met all my expectations so far.

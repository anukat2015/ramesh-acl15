Title: Thumbs Down on Hoover Duros
Content:
I have had this vacuum for 2 years and I hate it.  It is heavy, cumbersome, always tips over. A pain to change the bag the attchments etc. I do not mind vacuuming but this machine makes me miserable.  I am in search of a better vacuum and cant wait to get rid of this one.  My next one will not be a Hoover based on my experience!

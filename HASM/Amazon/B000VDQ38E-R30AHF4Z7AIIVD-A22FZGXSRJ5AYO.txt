Title: Piece of Junk
Content:
Worked great for the first few times I've used it, but after the first four months I started having trouble with the brushes which had trouble rotating on any kind of surface when the vacuum was in use.  Today, the motor for the brushes died completely (and started smoking) and it wont pick up anything.

Title: Shuffle off to anywhere
Content:
Love the small size, small price and clip-on feature.  The Shuffle, like all iPods, has flawless sound quality.  One problem - the Shuffle does not come with a usb adapter to allow you to conenct to a stereo system & speakers. [ASIN:B002M3SOMO Apple iPod shuffle 2 GB Blue (4th Generation) NEWEST MODEL]

Title: Leaks Water and Bad Support
Content:
After 3 months this unit leaked very bad. I sent it in for service only to be told it was dirty and needed cleaning at a cost of $100! All though it is a nice working unit there is an obvious defect in this unit and it should be corrected before this unit is continued to be sold. Not recommended at all.

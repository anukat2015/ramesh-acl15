Title: THE BEST BUY!!
Content:
My sister just purchsed the ipod photo 40 gb after thinking a lot if it was a good idea, but recently she decided to buy it because she saw me that I had an ipod 40 gb (not ipod photo) and she saw that it was better to carry it than carrying mini discs and of coarse cd's, but she was afraid that it were very difficult to use or something like that, but I explained her that at least mine was very easy and that nowadays the ipod is the thing we all must have and they are releasinf lots of fun accesories for it and now that the screen is with color better!! 
so she bought it and started to install the itunes in her laptop and she was excited about it so I taught her how to import her music cd's to her library and to transfer them to the ipod and she was surprised how easy it was and now she can't wait to use it.
She is very happy with it and I am with mine too even though is not the color screen but it works the same way.
Now if you are buying an ipod make sure you buy ipod photo don't worry about the price because is worth it.

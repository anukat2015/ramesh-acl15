Title: Pleased With Purchase
Content:
I purchased the Dirt Devil Vision about 2 months ago and am quite pleased with it.  At first I was a little overwhelmed with all the attachments, hoses, and things.  This was my first canister vac and I would have appreciated more guidance form the instruction manual. I quickly mastered switching attachments and enjoy using it (as much as anyone can enjoys vacuuming).  I was amazed at the dirt it picks up and I love the retractable cord. I think it does an especially nice job on furniture (we have two cats). The canister is heavier than I expected so using it on the stairs is more difficult than I expected.  I think it's a great vacuum for the price.

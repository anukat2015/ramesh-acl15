Title: HORRIBLE product, HORRIBLE company, AVOID
Content:
I purchased 3 Gateway computers for my family and guess what?  They ALL broke down within 2 months, believe it or not.  This one was the fastest to.  The wireless did not work from the start.  The DVD burner did not work.  Like all the laptops I purchased, the lid was very sticky and you have to use 2 hands (one steadying the notebook) when making even the tiniest adjustment to the lid or else the whole notebook will raise and then hit the surface it's on.
When I sent this in for the repair, it took 4 weeks for me to get it back.  Then, the lid wasn't fixed at all (just like the others), all my data was erased even though it was only peripheral problems.
Just a horrible product and a horrible company.  I should've listened to everyone who told me not to buy from Gateway.  Never again.

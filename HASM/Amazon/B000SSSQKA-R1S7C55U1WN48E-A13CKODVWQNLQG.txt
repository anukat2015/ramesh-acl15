Title: Cord Too Short
Content:
I'd like to add my vote to all of the positive reviews and features; this is a lightweight, powerful and *inexpensive* unit that has replaced my $400 Kenmore (mainly because of the weight).  Also I think it's fairly quiet, at least relatively speaking.  Panasonic wins again!
On the other hand the cord length is a disappointment.  I guess 17' is less than I'm used to.  I have to change outlets quite a bit.  Please consider that before you buy!

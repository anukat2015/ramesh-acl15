Title: Beautiful Looking Junk
Content:
First, no one in the Kalorik customer service department knows what size cone filters this thing takes. That being said, I have yet to make a pot of coffee. But in conditioning the coffeemaker by running 3 pots of clean water through it, I see that it is leaking puddles all over the place. Next, the area you have to pour water through is a very narrow track around the filter, one inch wide at the widest, to about 3/8 of an inch wide -- nearly impossible without dripping all over. If you accidently get water in the filter area, it goes right through to the hotplate. If this isn't bad enough, what looks like copper/stainless in the photo is actually just copper color silkscreened over plastic. The brand name is in large stainless colored plastic letters. There is no stainless on this coffee maker, save the stainless ring around the bottom of the glass pot. Finally, it is noisy -- really noisy. I bought this to replace a 23-year old coffee maker that was much quieter than this. Oh, and did I mention the ungodly amounts of steam that comes right out the top vents? If it's under a low cupboard, it could do some serious damage in time. Also, it is HOT!!! (obviously, it is steam). Needless to say, I will be returning this pronto. Nice to look at if that's all you want it for, but if you want to actually make a pot of coffee and not ruin everything within a few feet of the coffee pot, then you can do way, way better than this -- and probably for half the price. Also, the picture is misleading. The large band of "stainless" at the bottom of the pot is actually just black plastic on the one I received. Too bad, it couldda been a contender.

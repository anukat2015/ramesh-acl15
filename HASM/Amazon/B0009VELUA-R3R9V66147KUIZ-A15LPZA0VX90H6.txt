Title: Still love it 1 year later
Content:
I saw a slew of hateful reviews but bought it anyway.  I knew it would be great and it still is.  It keeps coffee hot, tastes great, coffee doesnt ever taste burnt, timer is simple and I use it every day.  I just read the supposidly most helpful negative review.... complaints about the tiny fill hole.  Doesnt everyone keep the coffee pot near the sink and use the sink spray thing to fill coffee pots?  Wouldnt this make life easier?  There is a water level indicator on the side that you can see how much water you are putting in it easily.  I rinse it daily and on the weekend give it a good wasing, no big deal. So simple to set up at night.  One of my hands squirts water into the water hole and the other fills the basket with coffee, I know it takes less than 50 seconds to do this because I always do it when heating my kids drink in the microwave. Easy easy.  I am glad I gave Cuisinart another chance after their totally evil evil evil grind and brew horrible piece of junk..... but that is another story.

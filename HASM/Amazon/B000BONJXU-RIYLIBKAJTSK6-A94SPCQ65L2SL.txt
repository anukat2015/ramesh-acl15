Title: Best kept secret in consumer electronics
Content:
I'm extremley grateful to Amazon and all the great reviewers for steering me towards the Sansa M230's direction. I've had it for a couple of days now and I love it. I'm not much of a music fan so at first I was lukewarm about purchasing an mp3 player. I didn't need to hold 1000 songs, so I needed something that was cheap, reliable and didn't have that cheap iPod wannabe look that so many other mp3 players had. The Sansa fit my needs perfectly. I would suggest everyone get one, even if you're not much of a music fan. I personally use it for listening to podcasts as well as music and it's a nice balance, and also 512mb might not seem like a lot but it does the job for me. The controls are very easy to figure out. Compared to the iPod the Sansa's advantage is its price, the more solid and compact design as well as the fact that you have option of picking a online music retail store of your choice instead of being married to iTunes.

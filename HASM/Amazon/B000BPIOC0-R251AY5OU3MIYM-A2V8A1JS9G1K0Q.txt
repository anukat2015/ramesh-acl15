Title: A GREAT LITTLE HEATER FOR THE MONEY
Content:
I bought this heater for my son's room downstairs where he has a large slider that lets in the draft.  It kept his whole room warm throughout the night and he is very happy with it.  Now he is back at college and I am using underneath my computer desk, which is also downstairs and gets a draft, it warms up the whole area.  It does not get super hot, even at the higher temperature, but I find that it is enough. The one downside is that tips over too easily, the base should be wider to totally support it.  I'm sure it is fine on a hardwood floor, but I have always used it on a carpet.  It does have automatic shut off for safety, but it is annoying to have it fall backwards.  I now prop it lightly against something and it is fine.  I paid $18 for it at Kmart, and you can't go wrong at that price, but keep in mind the possible "tipping backward" factor!

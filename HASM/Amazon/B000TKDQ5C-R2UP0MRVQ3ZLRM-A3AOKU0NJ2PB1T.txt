Title: I love this heater
Content:
I use this heater to keep away the chill (overactive AC at work).  I definitely does the job without taking up much space.  It is now very cozy at my desk.  I like the fact that it cycles on/off so once I set the desired temp. I don't have to fiddle with it for the rest of the day.

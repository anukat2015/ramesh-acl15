Title: The camra I have been waiting for
Content:
I have been taking pictures since 1978. I have used many different camera brands and types, both film and digital. This is my favorite. Pentax did a very good job making the controls user friendly. I was able to figure out 85% of the functions without ever opening the well written manual. That is always a plus in my opinion.
The file size is huge. It allows for major cropping. It will work with all of the old manual Pentax lenses as well as the new auto-focus models. For someone like me that has old glass, it will save you a lot of money. The other plus is that there is a lot of high quality glass available on EBay that will work with this camera, if you don't mind using manual exposure. I have taken beautiful pictures using lenses from the late 70's. 
Overall if you are looking to step up to a DSLR I think it would be hard to beat the K20D. I enjoy using it everyday.
Do your part in stimulating the economy. Buy this camera!

Title: Coffee Connaisseur
Content:
This is a great coffee maker in design and function on that I love it. The down side that I see is the grind function which I will explain. For a standard drip coffee maker the grind of the coffee should be about 1/16 in size ground particle that would be on dial number grinder between 3 and 4. The grinder it self on this coffee maker is just like any other and works as it should. The problem is the non-removable metal screen the holes are too big and allows the grind to be to big for a drip system. The size of the grind that goes into the coffee filter basket is ideal for a French press but not a drip system so the result is a coffee lacking full flavor and aroma. So my score is a 3 for design and function with negative 2 for not producing a good brew of coffee if it was not for that I would have given a 5

Title: Great upgrade from earlier models
Content:
I am coming from an E-300 and I can say this is definitely worth the upgrade. This camera with the 70-300mm lens is a great, inexpensive and portable set-up for nature photography. Overall, I do prefer the physical build quality over Nikon/Canon in this price range.
Only negatives for me are no video and being a bit behind on low light performance.
I would point people to the very detailed DPReview on this camera.

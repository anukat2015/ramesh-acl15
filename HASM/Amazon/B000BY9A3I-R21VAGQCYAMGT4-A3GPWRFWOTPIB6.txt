Title: Great vacume for the price
Content:
We recently built a new home with a lot of hardwood floors and our old vacuum quit working.  My wife and I didn't want to spend a lot of money and needed something for our active family to include her two new kittens.  The Dirt Devil vacuum is outstanding on the hardwood floors.  It gets around easy because of its light weight and the handle gets under furniture with ease.  It also has a really cool auto-rewind for the extension cord.  The only reason I wouldn't give this vacuum 5 stars is the carpet feature.  It does well on carpet but not great.  However, if you have a lot of stairs, it does better than an upright because of its ease of use.  It also does really well picking up the cat hair and my kids actually use it in their rooms.  I would definitely buy another one the next time I'm in the market.  Very good vacuum for the price.  No need to spend hundreds more.

Title: A good vacuum cleaner for a small apartment.
Content:
This vacuum cleaner works fine. There are however two drawbacks. It is noisy, and the plastic it is made of is really cheap, so much that you can't help thinking that it is gonna break in your hands.
Though, it fulfills its duty. If you want not to spend too much money when buying a vacuum cleaner for a small apartment, this one is a good choice.

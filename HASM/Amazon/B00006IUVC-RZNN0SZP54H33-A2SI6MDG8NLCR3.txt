Title: The dribble cup of carafes
Content:
We have the basic Versabrew at work and it just boggles the mind that the engineering on this carafe made it through whatever Quality Assurance program B&amp;D has. Maybe none based on this dribble cup carafe.  There is no way to pour liquids out of this thing without it dribbling/leaking/spooshing down the side and bottom of it and all over the counter/floor/dog/shoes.Maybe this was their gag line of coffee makers?I give this two stars based on the fact that it does indeed make coffee.  It gets an F- in engineering.

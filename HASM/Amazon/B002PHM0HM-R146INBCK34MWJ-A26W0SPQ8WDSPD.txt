Title: Great Laptop for the Price!
Content:
This has many of the bells and whistles of a much more pricey laptop. I paid $1749 plus tax and shipping was free when I got mine.  I've had it since Christmas and so far it works great, even with on-line video gaming. It's size packs more power than any others I had in the past and it has a cool design and shell.  It is a perfect laptop for any college student as it will handle even the most demanding software. I got it thru Amazon and then got extended warranty plus damage coverage for most anything through SquareTrade Warranty on-line.  I also like the Windows 7 that came with it.  It is a huge improvement over the last Windows operating system.

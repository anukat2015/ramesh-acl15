Title: It's OK...
Content:
Well, it is an okay vacuum machine, but I really do not think is strong enough. It is very good for carpets, but that much fo hard floors. 
+ Easy to clean and wash
+ come with 4 attachments, great
+ very aggressive for carpets
- it is quite heavy and big
- hard floor vacuum is not strong enough
- does not have cleaning sensor

Title: Great camera that holds its value!
Content:
I have an E-3 and bought this as a backup.  I use Olympus cameras and lenses for professional work including weddings and sporting events.
High ISO is not a strong point of the system, but their glass is second to none!
The supersonic wave system on olympus works while others can only begin to try and get their dust removal system up to par.
I shot a motor vehicle accident for the local paper during a hail/ sleet storm. Camera and the 50-200mm were soaked.
got home. not one issue!

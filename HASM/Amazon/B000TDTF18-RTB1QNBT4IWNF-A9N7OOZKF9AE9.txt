Title: This machine rules period.
Content:
Front loading and with a permanent filter (like bagless vacuums, no need for paper filter; trees saved, hassle saved, money saved). The perm-filter is a fine mesh screen of copper color. You can take the filter out and use a paper filter if you HATE MOTHER EARTH. 
It's easy to load water and coffee, because, hey, we're bleary-eyed and in need of caffeine, not complexity. It also looks cool; function and style.

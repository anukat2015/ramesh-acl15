Title: Inconsistant quality control with holmes?
Content:
I bought one of these heaters for my dining room, and then decided to get another one for my living room.  The 2nd one came packaged as if it were already used and maybe returned.  I plugged it in and it emitted a strong chemical odor, so I sent it back and got a refund.  I contacted Holmes and they sent me another one.  This one worked for a few months and then started blowing cool air.
So, it's the luck of the draw with holmes heaters.  You might get one that works really well, or you might get a lemon.

Title: "Funnest iPod ever", but wifi buggy under firmware 2.1
Content:
This is a great iPod as others have said in their reviews but a couple of warnings:
1) WiFi connections to routers using WPA encryption are a problem (hopefully will be fixed in future firmware update). There's a thread on Apple Support Forum with 6000 views so this is a common problem. Since WiFi is a big part of this ipod's appeal you may be disappointed.
2) Many accessories for Touch 1G (chargers, etc.) won't work with the Touch 2G.

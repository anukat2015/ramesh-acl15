Title: Wonderful
Content:
I love this camera. It's a bit of an upgrade from the Kiss N, which I mainly use. It definitely comes in handy. It's a lot safer to take everywhere than my Mark, ha. Great screen, I know some people have issues with the sizes of the screens. I really can't complain about this camera. The weight could be better, but then you wouldn't have such a great camera. I love the settings, the manual, the design, everything. It's wonderful.

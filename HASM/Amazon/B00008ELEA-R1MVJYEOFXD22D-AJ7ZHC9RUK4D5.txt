Title: Pray you won't need the warranty!
Content:
We have used Farberware Percolators since the 1960's. Our last purchase, an eight cup, lasted only one month. Still in warranty, I called to make a claim. I found the "customer service rep" so uncooperative and plain hateful that I decided to skip the warranty and go elsewhere. The "lady" that I talked to is meaner than water moccasin.

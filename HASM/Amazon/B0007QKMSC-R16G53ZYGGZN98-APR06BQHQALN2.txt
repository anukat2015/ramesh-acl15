Title: No CF card
Content:
I just got this camera as a gift.  It came in a timely fashion.  I have a Canon EOS 650 so many of the features are similar.  I was disappointed that there was no CF card included in the box.  There is nothing in the description of the product that states the CF card is sold seperately.  The manual eventually tells you the card is sold seperately but not until you get to the part about inserting the card.  I have purchased other digital cameras online and they have come with a basic card.  Perhaps you could make note that the CF card is sold seperately?  Thanks.

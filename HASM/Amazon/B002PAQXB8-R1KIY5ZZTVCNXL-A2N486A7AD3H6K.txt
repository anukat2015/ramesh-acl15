Title: A desktop for your lap
Content:
Having held out to upgrade my home computer until Windows Vista went away, I'm very glad I did.  It gave ASUS a chance to move beyond motherboard production into full-blown computer manufacturing.  And a good move it was!  I'm very happy with this unit.  It's fast; it's loaded with features (some of which I didn't even know it had); it's got a two-year warranty; battery life is double anything I've experienced before; and I absolutely love the lighted keyboard.
As for Windows 7, it's taking me a while to get used to it.  XP is still near and dear to my heart and ingrained in my brain.  But the quick boot-up, and ASUS' ability to start up for certain purposes without even using Windows 7, are winning me over.
So far my only complaint is about the glossy black finish -- which probably is better than a police technician for collecting fingerprints.  I prefer the black matte finish of my Lenovo.  I was intending, in fact, to purchase another Lenovo, but the ASUS won me over.  I would highly recommend this unit to anyone who needs a real work-horse for the home office.

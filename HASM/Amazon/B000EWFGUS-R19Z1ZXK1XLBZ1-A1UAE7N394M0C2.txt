Title: Great, except for the coffee pot cover
Content:
I bought this coffee pot because it's supposed to be quiet.  Believe me it is.  It makes good coffee and is easy to use.  My only gripe is the lid.  Most coffee pot lids snap onto two pegs on the pot.  This cover has closed up holes, so the pegs on the pot have to bend some before the pegs will slide into the holes on the lid.  Well, it didn't take long (3 weeks) for one the pegs to fall off.  I'm not sure how loose it will be when the second peg falls off.  It's too bad to have such a goofy lid attachment scheme on an otherwise great coffee pot.

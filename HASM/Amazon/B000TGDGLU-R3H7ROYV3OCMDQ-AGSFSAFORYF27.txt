Title: Great space heater for the money.
Content:
Takes about a half-hour to really heat up, but it keeps the living room here warm on chilly nights very well, the 'Comfortemp' button makes operation as simple as it gets. If I was ever looking for a second space heater, I'd definitely buy this one again.

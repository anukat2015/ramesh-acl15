Title: Coffeeless in Syracuse
Content:
As so many other people have found our Platinum $150.00 brewer does exactly the same thing, it shuts itself off for no reason.  This is our second brewer the first one was sent back as it was defective also.  This time I cannot get ahold of customer service and they take at least a week to answer any emails.  I SUBMITTED A REVIEW ON THEIR SITE AND THEY DIDN'T POST IT.  It seems they only post reviews of 4 stars or better.  Keurig is horrible do not buy their produts.

Title: Decent coffee maker
Content:
We're generally please with the coffee maker.  I think Cuisinart has overextended it's brand.  I used to think Cusinart products were well designed and well made.  I no longer feel this way.
The coffee maker makes decent coffee and the thermal carafe does keep it warm.  We've had for about 2-years now and the black paint covering the portion of the coffee maker where the clock and the controls are, is beginning to rub off.  This is a poor design.  The coffee maker is beginning to look a bit tacky as the paint rubs off.
Other than that, we've been pretty happy with it.

Title: Good Supplemental A/C unit
Content:
I work for the Air Force and due to budget cuts they (Air Force Leadership) has been trying to save money by shutting off A/C in our offices on the weekends and increasing the temp during the work week.  Not the best thing to do in west Texas in my opinion.  Anyway we work a lot on the weekends.  This unit works great at cooling down our office.  As the other reviews have stated it is a bit noisy.  It ran for about 4 hours a day for two weeks and almost 8 hours last weekend and it hasn't had to be drained yet.  I did drain out about a cup of water before writing this review.  That tells me that the auto evaporation is working fine.  I would recommend this product.

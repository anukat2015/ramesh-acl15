Title: Great Entry Camera from someone that wants more than a Point and Shoot
Content:
I bought this camera a year ago from Amazon and have absolutely loved using it.  I was able to learn a lot about the creativity modes on this camera but for those of you that don't have a big interest in learning this, if still comes with the different auto settings that all Point and Shoot cameras come with.  I think that this would be a great gift for someone that is wanting to learn photography without a huge price tag.  Then they can always upgrade later on if and when they out grow this one.  Canon's Rebel line has been pretty awesome on adding features that the prosumer's cameras have but without the big price tag.  So save yourself a little money and get a great camera!

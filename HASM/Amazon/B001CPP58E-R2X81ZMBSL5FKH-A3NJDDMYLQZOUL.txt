Title: Some Signfiicant Disappointments
Content:
This heater has some very positive and some very negative attributes. On the positive side, this little heater puts out a lot of heat. It's perfect for heating our bedroom quickly. 
On the negative side, it is sometimes difficult and annoying to use. The beep it sounds when turning it on or turning up the heat or adjusting it in any way is unbelievably loud. It simply cannot be adjusted if anyone happens to be sleeping anywhere close to it. 
Second, the thermostat does not work well. I will run it in one room and then move to another, much colder room. When I plug it in and turn it on, the heater indicates that the room has already reached 72 degrees, when it clearly is much colder. The issue is rather that the internal temperature of the unit is higher. This is annoying. In order to make it work in the new room, I have to adjust the desired temperature much, much higher. 
Third, there is a supposed safety feature that turns the heater off if it is tipped. In previous models, this feature was in fact triggered when the heater tipped over. In this model, there is a lever on the underside that must be pressed in in order for the heater to turn on. This means that it will not function on most carpets and cannot be moved without shutting the thing off and making it emit the loud beep once it's back in place. I have to place a magazine or book under the unit for it to work and slide it along the floor in order to move it. 
While the unit puts out a decent amount of heat, had I known what a hassle using the heater would be, I probably would have purchased something else.

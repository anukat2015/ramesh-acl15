Title: Sad
Content:
I received this as a gift for Christmas and it seemed like it was going to be an easy to use and easy to sync to my computer. I plugged it in and the back light on the device was not working and it has to be sent back for a new one. I however was able to sync it up to my computer easily, and moving the music and videos on and off of the device was very easy with the Zune software. The sounds with the supplied headphones are mediocre at best. I would suggest looking for a better set of headphones. I contacted Amazon and let them know what the issue was with the backlight and they have shipped out a new device and it should be here in a few days. I have to say Amazon made it easy to return and replace.

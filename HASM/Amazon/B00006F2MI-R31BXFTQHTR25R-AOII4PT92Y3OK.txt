Title: A great little machine if you follow the rules
Content:
Works great as long as you adhere to some lessons gleaned from reviews: 1) Use a paper filter.  The included gold filter doesn't allow adequate brew time.  2) You gotta clean it.  Every time.  Even if you don't use the grind function.  Just rinse and wipe or put it in the dishwasher.  I'd give this unit 5 stars if I didn't have to clean it even after a  nongrind brew, necessary because the brew process steams up the grinder.  If they can put a man on the moon ... etc.  (Not sure they can still put a man on the moon though.)  3)  The dribble-when-pouring problem popped up once, but was easily fixed.  Results from the complexity of the thermal pot cap, which lets brewed coffee in, but doesn't let heat out.  If you get this problem, rinse out the cap and wiggle the little in/out flap a couple of times.Bottom line: great coffee, thermal pot keeps coffee hot for hours without burning, intuitive controls, easy to set timer, some cleaning annoyance, but worth it.

Title: Effective but loud.
Content:
This heater is fairly loud compared to the other forced-air space heaters I have used.  I returned it because it woke me up at night whenever it switched on.  There was also a barely-audible sqeal it started to develop as it oscillated.  If you are a heavy sleeper, or have a large enough bedroom that you can tuck the heater in a far corner, this probably won't be an issue for you.  One other complaint is that I had to reset the thermostat every time I turned it on, because it doesn't remember the settings after being turned off.  Otherwise, it did the job nicely.

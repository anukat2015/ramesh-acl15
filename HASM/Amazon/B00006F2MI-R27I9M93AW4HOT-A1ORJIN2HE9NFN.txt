Title: BACK TO BASICS
Content:
I was really looking forward to not having to grind a bunch of beans and store them for use in my current Cusinart paper filter coffeemaker.  Now, I have to get beans out twice a day (I drink coffee in the morning and at night) and have to clean the top grinder unit and clean out the filter unit before each use. This coffeemaker is very irritating.  The carafe hold 50 oz. of coffee which isn't that much if you use a typical 8 oz. coffee cup.  The carafe needs to be tilted at a much steeper angle, which in itself isn't a problem.  But, it is almost impossible to get all of the coffee out of the carafe.  So I really don't even get the full 50 oz. I am almost ready to change to become a tea drinker! If this unit cost maybe $40 the irritations would be acceptable, but for $120-$130 I consider it a rip off.  I would like to see Cusinart recall this coffeemaker and refund everyones money! I'm going back to my paper filer, ground coffee only, coffeemaker.

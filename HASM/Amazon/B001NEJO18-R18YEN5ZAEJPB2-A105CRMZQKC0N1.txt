Title: A computer of missed potential
Content:
This is a fast, complex laptop all but ruined by the Vista operating system, hard disc restoration system and very poor unwanted software like Norton 360.  It mysteriously crashed the first week and I had to use the recovery system, losing a lot of work and files in the process.  I guess I will keep it but I am disappointed with it.

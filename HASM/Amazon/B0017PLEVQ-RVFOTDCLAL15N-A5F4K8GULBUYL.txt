Title: Half Baked
Content:
I have now owned the Miele Aquarius for over two months.  I opted for the premium power brush and for an additional rough surface floor brush.  Although the suction is good and the filtration is probably good, many of the design details seem to be half baked, as follows:
The canister must be lifted from a hardwood floor by grasping both the front and rear.  Otherwise if I grasp only the handle, the rear wheel housings will swivel and scrape the floor.
The tiny wheels have plastic "ramps" that will rub against the edge of a higher floor when being pulled onto that floor.  If the highter floor is hardwood, you had better lift the canister first, and by both the front and rear per the comment above.
The tiny wheels with their plastic ramps do not cross over the power cord easily.
The in-board location of the swiveling wheels combined with the leverage of the hose exiting the canister vertically allow the canister to be tipped over easily.
The brush parking feature is nice, but it blocks the retraction of the power cord.
The power button and the cord retraction button are angled such that my foot usually slips off before they have been effectively pressed.
The parquet brush pushes fine dust ahead where it is not accessed by the suction.
The hose is actually a bit long and sometimes gets in the way.
The power cord is not as long as that of my Hoover Futura.
The detach mechanism for the power brush often gets depressed and separates as I clean underneath beds.
The power brush shuts off as the brush angle becomes nearly upright.  Although this is meant as a convenience feature, it becomes a nuisance as I vacuum tight spaces.

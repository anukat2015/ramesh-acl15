Title: Finally!
Content:
I just got this vacuum and I love it. I have three dogs in the house with hardwood floors. This is the first vacuum I've had that actually gets embedded dog hair out of the couch. It has great suction and the floor attachment moves in such a way that I can get completely under furniture with low clearance--it kind of flattens itself. I only had to unplug it once thanks to the long cord and long hose, which is also nice. I like the smaller bag (but not too small), 'cause old dog hair can stink, so I'd rather dispose of it more often. Great vacuum for the money!
Downsides: I wish the cord came out from somewhere else but the bottom or had some kind of clip to hold it in place. Not really an issue, but more a design flaw. Also, the suction reducer thingy is in a bad spot. It's where you actually hold the vacuum, so you can inadvertently open it. I pinched the heck out of my hand while closing it once, but I am super-clumsy. 
Still the best vacuum I've had.

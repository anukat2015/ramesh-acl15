Title: Good heater, but kind of finicky.
Content:
I don't agree with some of the reviews. I don't see that it's a fire hazard at all. My Big Buddy was delivered last week. Here's what I found:
My elevation in Virginia, About 800 feet 
Ambient temperature, 72.8 (in my house). Outside temp 29.0
1. Running on high on ONE Disposable Cylinder caused unit shutdown after 50 minutes. (Pilot started to flicker, cut out and then gas shut down). Single bottle was covered with ice (I assume that's bad...)
2. Running on TWO Disposable Cylinders got me the balance of three hours smoothly and well. 
3. No fumes observed at all. Some moisture, but cracking the window an inch kept it under control. 
4. A lot of heat. Too much for my wood floor. I had to put it on my brick mantle. This might scorch tile. 
5. It kept my upstairs (1000 square feet) at 72.5. Only a loss of 0.3 degrees over three hours. Better than expected.
Suggestion: If you are trying to run on high with disposables, use two of them. This is not in the manual.
I don't know how it works with tanks, or whether you need to feed one or both inputs. 
My unit did not come with the AC adapter. The batteries work.
If you bump it gently, it shuts off.
Conclusion:
For 139 bucks, it fits the bill well enough. It appears to be very well made, but the safety features make it tempermental. For my use as an emergency heat source, it's adequate.

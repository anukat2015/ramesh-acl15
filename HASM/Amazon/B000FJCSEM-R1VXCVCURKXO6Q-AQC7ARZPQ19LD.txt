Title: FH-797 Fujitronic Swamp Cooler
Content:
This cooler does not have a pump. It's the kind that has a kind of a ribbon that is dipped into the water tank. Water crawls up this ribbon and the fan blows on it. You'll have to fill the water up about every 4 hours of high speed. It holds about 2 gallons or so. The timed functions work very nicely. In the remote, it was very difficult to insert the batteries. Very tight in there. This product falls somewhere between a fancy fan and a pump type cooler. In AZ I think I'd rather have a pump type product. It's all plastic and can be damaged with a drop on anything hard. On the plus side though, it uses very little power to run. It can be run from the floor and moved about with ease. The manual deflector can be set to not blow directly on you.

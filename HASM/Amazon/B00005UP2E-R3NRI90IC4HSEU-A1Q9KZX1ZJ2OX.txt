Title: Was great for a few months...
Content:
I have a dog, two cats and a toddler. All super messy and giving me credo as a vac expert. I need to keep my floors cleared, but suffer from major back problems. I was ecstatic about the carrying option of this model. It was nice as a semi-backpack for a spell. Back pack vacs do not come cheap either!
Mine was super for about four months, then the suction left and the little belt clips broke (super flimsy clip design) and I cannot say the performance is worth yanking it around the house ANY more. I hate to throw it away, but it has for years been replaced by the brand that, "doesn't lose suction". 
So the cost effectiveness of the item was not too bad if you think of it as disposable. Not too great for landfills though...

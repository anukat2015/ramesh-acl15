Title: Worthwhile Accessory to Buddy Heaters
Content:
If you have a Buddy Heater, this item is a must have. The buddy heaters work off of three different sources:1lb, 20lb and 100lb containers. The 1lb containers connect directly with the heater. The 20 and 100lb tanks need an adapter and either a regulator or filter. First, realize the price difference and waste of using 1lb tanks. Your two options for connecting to the 20lb and 100lb tanks are either this adapter hose/regulator kit that stores neatly on the underside of the Big Buddy Heater or to buy the adapter and a filter piece seperatly. 
A 1lb tank costs almost $10 a pop.
A 20lb tank costs almost $20 to refill ($1 for 1lb)
- the 20lb tank costs $40 if you need to buy the tank as well

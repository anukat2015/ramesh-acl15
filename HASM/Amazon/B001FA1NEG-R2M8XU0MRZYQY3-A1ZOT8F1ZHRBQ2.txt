Title: Great MP3 in Nice package!
Content:
4th generation Nano is elegant.  8 gigs is huge amount of storage.  Can hold music, video and several audible books.  Aluminum case with curves.  Menu has talk option so you can hear the different categroies.  Also audible click option when you change categories.  Battery life is surprisingly long between recharges.  Put into Aux jack in car and place thru car speakers.  Better yet hook into IPOD interface in some cars and menu is visible in display.  Very satisfied.  Only shortcoming - like all Apple IPODS - the battery is not user-replaceable.  I have seen do it yourself stuff on web for olderer modeles but I think the 4th generation case can't be opened by the user without ruining it.

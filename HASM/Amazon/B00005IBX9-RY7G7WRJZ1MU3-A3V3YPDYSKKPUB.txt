Title: Only buy if you prefer Dunkin Donuts to Starbucks
Content:
I bought the Cuisinart 1200 one week, and four pots ago.  I was replacing a Krups Pro Aroma that had lasted about seven years which I loved.  However, after reading reviews I decided to give the Cuisinart a try instead of a new Krups (I had reward coupons from Best Buy and they didn't carry Krups) what a mistake.  One pot is weaker then the next.  This morning I tried seven scoops of beans, I grind my own, using the same beans I used to only use six of in the Krups.  Today's pot was so weak neither my husband nor guest chose to go for the customary second cup.  I had my second, but it needed to be black and barely had taste.  I should say that I don't like Dunkin Donuts because I find their coffee weak.  If you like Dunkin and not Starbucks this could be the coffee maker for you.  I do have to say that the carafe does not leak and that the machine was very easy to use.  A lot of people comment on the temperature, and I found it to be hot enough.  I found some issues with the water reservoir but would have been willing to live with it if the coffee was good.  I am returning the coffee maker and currently debating between the Krups FM or KM 12-cup models.

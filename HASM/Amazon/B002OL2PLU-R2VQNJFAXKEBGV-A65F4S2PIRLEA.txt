Title: "Very Dissapointing"
Content:
This product is not stable. Many times lost connection from the internet. I cannot even play youtube for I experienced many times the screen will just freeze. Video playback is excellent. The resolution is very, very good. So, if you are looking for a replacement to your netbook, dont think about buying this product. it will just dissapoint you. The system is very unstable.

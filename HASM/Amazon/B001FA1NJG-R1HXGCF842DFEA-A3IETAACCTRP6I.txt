Title: 1 Star?
Content:
I have read most of the 1 star reveiws and they are almost all human errors. They don't know how to work the Zune or their computer. I had a 30GB Zune until it spent the night in an inch of Powerade. So maybee Zunes need to be water proof. I wasn't mad though because it was a good excuse to upgrade to the 80 but then the 120 came out and I love it. Plus I'm sick of how people will do anyting for an ipod.

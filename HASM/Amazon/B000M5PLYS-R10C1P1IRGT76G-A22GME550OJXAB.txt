Title: Great heater, works well
Content:
For such a little unit, it sure works well. I've used a delonghi (sp?) unit that was worth 70 dollars and 3 times taller than this unit... and the end result is the same. I've brought this to my friend's place and that room is quite large.. like 14feet by 9.. and it warmed up the sleeping area nicely. can get really hot if needed and can be used to maintain a room temperature as well. I would gladly buy it again if this were to break somwhere down the line.

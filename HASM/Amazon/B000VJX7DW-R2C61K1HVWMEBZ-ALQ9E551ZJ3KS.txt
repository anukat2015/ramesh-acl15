Title: Best Yet!
Content:
I have a D100 to compare my new D300.. The D300 is so far more advanced that I feel like a little kid playing with a toy. The ability to take good pictures in low light without a flash using a very high ISO and pushing the compensation settings to 1.7 makes it a pleasure.  I visit museums that don't allow flash and now have some really good pictures of my subjects. I use the burst speed and continuous focus for my radio control car racing and have great pictures almost movie like. I like the large viewer and the amazing number of choices that can be programmed. The dials are conveniently located. The only drawback is that I can't use my Capture 4 software with the D300.

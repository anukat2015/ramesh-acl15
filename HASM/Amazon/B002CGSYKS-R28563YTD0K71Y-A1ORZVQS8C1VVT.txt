Title: Fantastic Camera
Content:
Was tired of my big canon 40d and big lenses. Great pictures but too large hour after hour. This camera took an indoor shot with no flash at over 1000 iso and looked excillent!
Very portable and the depth of field looks more 3d than just a flat sharp picture. I have owned an e-300 and e-510 and new olympus had a major idea with the high end Zuiko lenses.
Have 2 panasonic lenses and they are excillent also and made in japan.
World class camera minus a built in flash.

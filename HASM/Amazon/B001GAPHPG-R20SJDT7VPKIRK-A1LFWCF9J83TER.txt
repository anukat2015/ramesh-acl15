Title: Great camera for any camera buff
Content:
I take more bad pictures than good... with this camera set up, I am able to take more pictures faster than I could with my old 35mm SLR and I am also able to filter out all the bad to find the good without the expense of developing the bad along with the good.  I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to transition from point and shoot to digital SLR...  very easy to use and fun at the same time and the picture quality is awesome.  You can't beat the deal of getting a camera body and two lenses for one low price... I'd say, if you are interested, get it while you still can.

Title: Amazing, yet affordable
Content:
I had an older desktop compter, and had been thinking about an upgrade for some time... When I wandered accross this Laptop on Amazon, I was amazed at the price and features.  
This laptop has done everything I've asked of it... I loaded a few older games onto it, and they run without any problem  (Star Wars games).
I ordered a copy of MS Office, and have used the wireless and wired internet connections in my travels... 
The battery time is really good, so I can unplug for an hour or two without worry.
Windows Vista (and the new version of Office) taking some getting used to, but I just keep going until I find what I'm looking for.
If I have to say something negative about having my own laptop for the first time, it's that I am not used to having a cooling fan right there in front of me. The desktop computer sits under a desk, where I can mostly ignore the fan noise.  The laptop gets louder when it needs cooling.  
A few really nice things, the front headphone jack, so I can listen quietly to my video games, and the excellent speakers so I can listen out loud when I want to...  
The huge screen...  Really, if this is a 15.4 inch, then I'm glad I did not find larger. This screen is huge to me.
I'm still getting used to the glidepoint sometimes sending my cursor running random directions, but I'm considering buying a mouse.
This is a wonderful laptop. If this model isn't available, then check out other Acers for a good bargain, but quality laptop.

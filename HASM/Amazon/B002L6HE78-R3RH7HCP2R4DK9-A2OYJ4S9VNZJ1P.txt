Title: First time iPod buyer who is totally satisfied!
Content:
I have never bought an iPod or anything from Apple for that matter, and so I was starting out with a clean slate so to speak, when using this product.  Not only were my expectations met, they were surpassed by far!  It only took me a few minutes to get used to the controls and the menus.  The sound quality is great, and so is the storage capacity- only a minimal amount of the 8gb is used up by software.  
I want to address the battery issues that people have brought up- there are a few things you can do to make it better!  I have yet to have a problem with my battery, and I am constantly hitting the next key (which lights the backlight up) and playing games while on my breaks at work or watching tv.  At worst I have had it get to being almost red by the end of the day so I charge it before bed.  If you want to improve the life of your battery, charge it fully the first time you open it, then let the battery completely drain before charging it again.  Constantly charging it from half full causes the life to slowly deteriorate.  If you set the backlight to only stay on for 5 seconds (which is enough to read a song title, etc) then you will improve your usage time exponentially.
Overall it is an excellent mp3 player, and the extras you get along with it are great!  I love the games, they're easier to play than mobile phone games.  And the accelerometer feature is fantastic!  I love being able to shake it to go to the next song, as silly as it is.  I haven't tried the video camera very much, but I do love the FM radio, it picks up more stations than my regular radio!
Definitely worth the money, I would really recommend it to anyone!

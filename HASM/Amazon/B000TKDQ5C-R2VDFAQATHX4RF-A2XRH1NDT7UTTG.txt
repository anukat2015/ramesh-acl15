Title: noisy but very warm!
Content:
love this little heater! i keep it by the bed at night or next to the couch when i'm watching tv, and it makes a huge difference. people seem to complain that it's noisy, but i'm fine with it bc it's not to the point that i can't watch a movie or read a book with it next to me.  the difference between the "1" and "2" settings is very subtle, but i guess "1" is low and saves energy. anyway, i would definitely buy this again and recommend it to others

Title: TERRIBLE on Carpets...AWESOME on Tile Floor...
Content:
I would first like to start out by saying that I wish I'd never bought this over-priced hunk of plastic. I've had it for about 7 months now and HATE it! I was trying to avoid the high cost of a Dyson, and instead ended up with this nightmare...DO NOT BUY THIS!
That said, this vacuum is HORRIFIC on carpets. My house is half light colored berber carpet and half tile. I have three some-what plush area rugs in dark colors. On the area rugs, no matter which height setting I set it to, I would roll over dog hair or crumbs over and over, and it would still be on the carpet. Now, that's just what I can see...I can't imagine all that's NOT getting picked up on the lighter carpet that I haven't noticed. 
However, this vacuum works better then any others I've tried on tile floor. On the lowest setting it picks everything right up, no pushing dirt around, or shooting it out the back of the vacuum onto my feet as my Dirt Devil does. 
So...where does this leave me on vacuuming days? Having to drag out TWO different vacuums to clean my house. My trusty old Dirt Devil for the carpets, and the Infinity for the tile floors...I really hate vacuuming days. Save yourself the hassle and just get the Dyson.

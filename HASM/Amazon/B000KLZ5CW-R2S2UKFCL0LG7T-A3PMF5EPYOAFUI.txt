Title: A waste of money
Content:
The unit has several problems:
- It cannot cool down a room larger than 100 sq. feet in size
- The drain bucket gets filled up within a half an hour and thus needs to be dumped out or it will profusely dump water all over your floor
- It is too loud (compared to other portable units and window units)
- The drain bucket does not sit right when placed where the water comes out (it needs to be titled upward, and thus holds even less water)
- On really warm days, it failed to cool off my apartment by more than a few degrees (still over 80 degrees in the apartment even if it ran all day)
- You cannot aim the air up or down, so it blows at the ceiling (maybe has something to do with how well it cools?)
- The customer service from the manufacturer "whynter" is absolutely terrible, they offered me no advice other than to make sure I have it set to "cool" and not "heat"
- The customer service from stacks and stacks is no better, they do not return calls, emails, and their automated voice system on their phones says that you have called outside of normal business hours even if you are within business hours
I can keep going, but overall it is not worth the money; it doesn't do its job, and will damage your floors from the water that will spill everywhere. You are better off buying one where the drip hose can be extended outside of your window.

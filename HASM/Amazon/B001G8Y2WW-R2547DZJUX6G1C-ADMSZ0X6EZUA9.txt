Title: Cuisinart DCB-650BC Grind-and-Brew
Content:
I bought this as a replacement for an older model Cuisinart. The new model is works exactly like the old one. Same features as the old one, brews a pot of coffee in about 10 minutes. Just put in your favorite coffee bean and you'll get the perfect pot of coffee. Other Reviews have complained about cleaning the coffemaker, it takes about 30 seconds to clean out the grinder and coffee basket and get ready to brew a new pot. The thermal pot keeps the coffee hot all morning.

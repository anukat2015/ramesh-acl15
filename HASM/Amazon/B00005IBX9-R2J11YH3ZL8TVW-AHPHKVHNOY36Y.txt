Title: The Best Coffee Maker I have ever owned!!
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for 3 years!  It makes the best coffee.
Pros:  
Makes great tasting Coffee
Simple to use
Brews Fast
Washable Coffee Basket!
Very attractive design
Carafe temperature control, less hot...more hot
Cons:
Hard to keep stainless steel finger print proof, you need a stainless steel cleaner to keep it looking sharp
Cost of replacing the charcoal filter...after mine wore out...I just started brewing coffee without the charcoal filter and it is fine
I would definately HIGHLY RECOMMEND this coffee maker!!  I LOVE mine

Title: A Review of Complaints
Content:
I researched my new coffee maker for a long time before deciding on this model and, after a month of use, am still satisfied with my decisions.  I thought I would give my opinion on the common complaints about this model.1. It's too tall.Yes, it is tall, and you'll probably have to pull it forward to fill it, but this has been true of all my coffee makers.2. The resevoir area is small and difficult to use.Again, true to some extent, but workable.  I make a point of always programming my pot so I don't have to deal with it when I'm groggy, but still occasionally splash - then again I'm a Klutz.3.  You can not &quot;seat&quot; the pot correctly leading to &quot;accidents&quot;.Again, true - but you'll only only do it once - and if you're reading this you've been duly warned!!4. The Brewing Alarm is Loud and Obnoxious.If the Cuisinart people are reading this, this really should be an OPTION!  However, given that it is not, it doesn't bother me.  If you're bedroom is close to your coffee maker it could be a problem, but I don't find it that loud.5. The included filter clogs with small grounds leading to &quot;accidents&quot;.I use a paper filter - for me it's less messy - and I think there's a health reason for using paper anyway, but this could be a real concern if you want to use the gold filter and small grounds.All in all I am very happy with my choice - if the situation changes I will post it here.

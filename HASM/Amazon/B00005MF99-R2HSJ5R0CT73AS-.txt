Title: Fantastic Idea with a Bad Design
Content:
I bought my Smart Brew Plus at Target about a year ago and loved the idea I could snatch a cup of coffe while the pot was brewing.  I think this is a wonderful concept that has great merit.  Sadly, the carafe that comes with the system doesn't hold up to even my light daily use.  The flimsy clips that hold the carafe on, broke off during the first month.  I limped along for quite a while with this problem.  Now, the plastic ring around the top has separated from the glass part of the carafe.  As it brews, coffee gets trapped in here and is impossible to get out.  A replacement carafe costs almost as much as a new pot!  Additionally, the burner ring became warn after about 4 months of washing with only a damp cloth.

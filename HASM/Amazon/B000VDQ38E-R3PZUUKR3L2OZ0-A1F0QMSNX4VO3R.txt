Title: Not just a sales gimmick!
Content:
Nowadays we are inundated with a whole slew of products vying for our important dollar by making claims to make our lives easier and do all of the things we wish something could do, only to find out these products fall far short of such claims, and we are left with another useless purchase to fill our closets or attics.
Not so with the Bissell 3920! After spending weeks researching vacuums both online and at stores I convinced my wife to take a chance on this one. We own a 2 year old Australian Shepherd mix who's hair has found its way into every crevice of our daily lives. Inviting guests over is a chore involving a few hours of sweeping, vacuuming, dusting and brushing our dog... and we still find ourselves saying "oh don't sit there, that's where he lays down all of the time and you might get hair all over you". The ritual lint-brushing my wife and I partake in before we go out anywhere can be time-consuming, exasperating and sometimes comical.
After convinced on trying the Bissell 3920, we researched for the best price, and found that going to Sears we could save $10 versus shopping online, despite the temptation of free shipping. We brought it home, and I set it up fairly quickly.
SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRE:
When you open the box, you will find that the hoses, the little attachments, and the handle are separate. The instructions are simple but I believe that they could improve them by using photographs rather than drawings, although for it's price I can't blame them for saving a few pennies. It does come with several screws that you will have to put in, requiring a MEDIUM to LONG length cross-tip (phillips) screw-driver. The head of the screw-driver shouldn't be too small or fat. Take your time, don't get frustrated, and don't crank or bend things, it's all pretty easy when you're not in a rush, and one person should do just fine.
PROS:
- Extra long cord! Granted it takes some time to coil back up, but all my life I have had the issue of having to constantly unplug/re-plug the vacuum every so many feet, particularly in rooms with lots of furniture. With the cord on the Bissell 3920 I can plug it into the dining room and vacuum the entire living room while having plenty of slack left!
- Bagless. Easy to empty, no trips to the store for land-fill clogging bags!
- Powerful! This vacuum absolutely pulls everything out of our carpets and rugs, and using the hose only seems to give it more concentrated power unlike most vacuums I've used. 
- Assisted Drive? Haven't read it in the manual, but I noticed that while vacuuming that the Bissell 3920 practically drives itself forward requiring little to no pushing effort... life saver on the wrists!
- Effective attachments. The hose attachments do an exceptional job at pulling hair out from furniture... even the ones that our dog has "claimed" for a long time! No need to be slow with it either, I've found that a rapid back and forth action with the hair-getting attachments work better than a slower sweep. Cracks and crevices of furniture no longer hold a safe-haven for fur!
- Long hose. This hose is exceptionally long. It's long enough to reach the top of the stairwell while the vacuum is at the very bottom! I use it regularly to get above door and window sills WITHOUT a foot stool!
- Bright light. You can practically use this thing in the dark! Ha!
- Maneuverability. I love the way this baby easily turns and gets around furniture and for as big as it is it will get pretty far underneath couches and other furniture saving you time from having to whip out the hose or move furniture!
CONS:
- Noise. It's not the quietest, and the turbo pet hair erasing hose attachment does sound like a turbo, but it isn't like you're using it all the time, it's so powerful and deep cleaning that it gets brought out less than our old vacuum!
- Cord. Like I said earlier, takes a minute to wrap if you unwrap it all the way. Not really a con considering the benefit, but I dream of the day that the vacuum companies devise a self-contained retractable cord!
- The Hose. Yes, folks, if you pull on the hose the vacuum may tip over. But I blame this on the user. I have found that if you hold the hose about half-way and then extend the hose from your hand RATHER than from the vacuum you will have NO ISSUES. The BEST way is to hold the handle of the vacuum as if you were pushing it (with the front part locked up) and have the hose in your other hand. Trust me, it's simpler than it sounds.
- Dust spew. I read from others, and experienced my self some dust spewing out of the open tube when you use the hose. But after a minute of examining, I found out that it will only do this IF the vacuum itself is sitting on a dirty part of the floor. A easy solution to this is vacuum that spot up FIRST, THEN use the hose.
- Messy Canister. Yes, the canister leaves some dust and whatnot around where the canister is pulled out. Just take a damp cloth and wipe it. It is still better than dealing with a bag.
- Weight. It's really not that heavy, but lugging it up and down stairs might be difficult.
Don't blow your money on that exorbitantly priced "Dyson"! This utilitarian masterpiece will get every bit of your furry friends' hair, and do an exceptional job at cleaning EVERY nook and cranny of your house that you will never look at vacuuming as a difficult futile effort ever again!

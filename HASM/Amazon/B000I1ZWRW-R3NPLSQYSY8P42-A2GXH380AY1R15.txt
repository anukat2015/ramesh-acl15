Title: Incredible move from APS to DSLR
Content:
Long ago I shot a Pentax K-1000.  Soon after I was shooting the digital APS cameras.  Now the DSLR's are affordable; I saw what my father was shooting with his EOS XT and now the XTi is out.  I bought an XTi along with the EF 24-105mm lens, image stabilized (IS), L-glass.  After a month of shooting I can only say "wow"!  Spend the money on the lens.  Depth of field and color is excellent.  This more than blows away my old point and shoot digital camera.  Every time I download pictures there are at least a couple where I say wow, I can't believe how good that is... I'm just a hobby shooter, I dabble in photography, but this camera makes me feel like a pro.
I would also highly recommend the Cannon EX580 external flash.  Again like the lens, a little bit of cost, but in many of these pics using a bounce flash I can almost not tell I was using a flash at all.

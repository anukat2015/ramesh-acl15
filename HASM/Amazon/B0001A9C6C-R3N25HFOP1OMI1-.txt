Title: Saved by the shell

I bought this item to destroy it.  I wanted the 3.7Gig CF dirve inside this little marvel for my PDA.  It would have cost me much more then $250 to purchase this drive on my own.  While examining how I might extract the drive I noticed how sleek and light the Mini was.  I reasoned that this little dive probably has better battery life then my old generation 20Gig ipod.  Just for fun I plugged it into my Laptop and made an playlist of less then 3.7Gigs.  Now as I leave for my business trip this week my old heavy ipod is staying home and the Mini is going with me.Love the neat belt clip, love the earbuds.  Don't be fooled by Apple's in-ear phones or the Sony ones.  I've tried them all and the stock ipod earbuds have WAY better bass.I have yet to see how long it lasts (my 20Gig ipod is still going strong after 2 years now) but so far, I am very impressed.  My PDA will just have to limp along on my old 2Gig flash card.

Title: Easy to use but leaks
Content:
I owned this same model 5 years ago, I got it with a gevalia membership.  I liked it because I could make a quick cup of coffee but it started leaking after a year.  I contacted gevalia and asked if they would replace the coffee maker because I had a bunch of pods to use still.  They said no so I canceled my membershop and threw the coffee maker away.
I saw this on Woot yesterday for only $9 + $5 shipping.   [...]    I decided to give it another go, without the expensive membership.
$66 is a rip off and I hope nobody orders it from here.

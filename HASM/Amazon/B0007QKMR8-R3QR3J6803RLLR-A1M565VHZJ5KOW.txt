Title: My Camera arrived 20 days ago, and it DIED today.
Content:
I was very happy with my first digital SLR.  I have been snapping photos every day with my XT.  Today, at my daughter's birthday party, no less, the camera died without warning.  I took a few shots, turned it off as carefully as ever, and set it on the table.  When I tried to turn it back on a few minutes later, it wouldn't work.  No LCD, wouldn't turn on.  NOTHING!  I assumed it was the battery.  Took the battery home, charged it, and it still doesn't work.  Since the company's policy is 15 days to return an opened item, and I've had the camera for 20 days, I am wating to hear about any exceptions to the returns policy, or whether Amazon will step in somehow and do what is right.  I am sick over this.  Did I just throw $600 out the window, or will Canon, Vann's (the independent company) and Amazon do what is right.
Read other 1 & 2 star reviews.  The same thing seems to have happened to others as well. Perhaps these cameras have a fatal flaw.  I am discouraged, disappointed and disheartened.  Buyer Beware!
Will update!
UPDATE - 6 months later:
With Amazon's help, I was able to get another XT instead.  (Why should I have to send a 20-day-old camera for repairs?!?)  I've had the 2nd XT for 6 months now, and LOVE IT!  It's a great, reliable camera for a first time SLR owner.

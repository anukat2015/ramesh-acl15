Title: finally a real vacuum cleaner
Content:
In the last 10 years I have purchased 5 vacuums.  They are all out at the curb for the trashman.  This vacuum does everything the others did (combined), but with adjustable suction and great suction, quieter, easier to maneuver and has all the attachments that I need.
I recommend this to everyone.  It is great on all heights of carpet, but is especially great on hardwoods and tile.

Title: Pleasantly Surprised
Content:
To be honest, my initial reaction to this vacuum assembled was not great. It is huge and very heavy. Don't even think about getting underneath furniture or in corners without the attachments. Then I used the pet hair attachment on my couch. It was amazing. It sucked every last strand of cat hair off of the furniture. I continued on my way, clumsily maneuvering this giant thing about the house, hating that I bought such a huge vacuum. Then I looked at the canister. It was full. After two rooms, the thing was full. Now, I like to think that I keep a pretty clean house. Cleaner than most. In fact, I vacuumed two days ago with my old one. This thing managed to find an entire canister full of dust and hair in two rooms. Needless to say my opinion  changed immediately. I now love this vacuum. It's still big and heavy, but if it continues to do the job it is doing, I will be pleased.

Title: THIS ITEM IS NOT BLACK
Content:
I purchased the U50 not only for its good specs, but for its slick looks. In fact, I passed up similar machines simply because I didn't like the colors they came in. When the U50 arrived at my house, I opened the box expecting the beautiful black shown in the pictures. The beautiful black advertised in the product headline. Unfortunately, the machine that came out of the box is midnight blue with metallic sparkles. Might look good on a muscle car, but not so good on my laptop. When I called Amazon, they claimed they only stock the U50 in one color: black. Furthermore, Amazon's return policy on "open computers" only refunds 85 percent of the $1000 I paid. So, begrudgingly, I'm keeping this laptop. But I didn't get what I paid for and I won't be buying another computer from Amazon. If you're less superficial than me, I think you'll be happy with this machine--other than the color, it's really nice.

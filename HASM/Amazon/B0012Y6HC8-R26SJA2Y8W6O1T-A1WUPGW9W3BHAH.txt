Title: Great Camera - Nice LCD - Good Software - Easy PC Integration
Content:
Not much I can say here that others haven't already said, I'm just adding my vote to a well thought-out and functioning camera.  Canon has been taking accolades for their digital camera line for years, and this model continues to be a joy to use and own.   I'm super critical of tech stuff as I'm a 27 year tech-head veteran.  
Battery life is very good and memory is cheap compared to what it was.  I would stick with a Class 4 or Class 6 SDHC memory card.
While not a professional photographer, from the technical aspect of combining this unit with a PC and their software, they've provided a nice solution.  The software is fairly decent, not the best, but does the job.   Bundle it with Adobe Lightroom or just a simple Google Picasa and you are good to go with managing your photos.    
Both Lightroom and Picasa can view the RAW images and touch-up with this file format is exceptional.   The CameraWindow software and bundled utilities allows you to use a laptop to control the camera and settings, preview images on a larger screen, and instantly store into RAW/JPG file formats to disk.   This is a big bonus when in a studio environment.
Their Zoombrowser image viewer is very functional and usable.  While I'm now using Picasa and Lightroom to manage the images, Zoombrowser is certainly capable for any novice to intermediate user.
I use a 50mm lens, 18-200mm IS lens, and 580II flash as my primary equipment.  The only thing I could imagine getting next is a L series lens. 
Nice job Canon!

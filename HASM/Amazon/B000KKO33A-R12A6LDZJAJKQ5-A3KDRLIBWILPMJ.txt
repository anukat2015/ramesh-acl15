Title: Probably the best heater out there, but still some issues
Content:
I like this heater, and use it, but find that I cannot use it indoors without tripping my smoke alarms.  That's after rigorously adjusting the heater for a clean burn, warming it up for a half-hour in the garage first, and even using odorless fuel.  Mind you, the heater isn't smoking - far from it.  It's as clean a burn as I've ever seen from a kerosene heater.  Nonetheless, I can't use it indoors - period.  So I use it in a machine shed where I don't have the issue.  Your mileage may vary.
Pumps out tons of heat and the lighter works flawlessly.  It's well made, though the handle isn't stiff enough for the heater's weight.  If you're not careful when carrying the heater with full fuel, the handle can slip and detach, dropping the heater.  Used within its limitations, it's the best heater of its type out there.

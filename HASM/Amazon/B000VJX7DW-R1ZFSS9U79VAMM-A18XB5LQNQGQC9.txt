Title: Best Prosumer DSLR So Far
Content:
The Nikon D300 is the best DSLR so far made for the advanced consumer market. The features included in the D300 are or are almost the same as the professional Nikon D3 professional camera that is over three times the price. Best buy that I have made in a while and I am quite satisfied with the 18 to 200 mm lens and the SB-900 flash that I have purchased for it.

Title: Best MP3 player out there- no doubt about it
Content:
I got this Ipod as a Xmas gift, and I think it's awesome. It holds up to 500 songs, which is just plenty. It also holds podcasts and photos, and it's the only ipod compatible with the new Nike accesorie that you can buy for it. I love how thin it is, it fits nice and snug in my pocket. It it also hard to break AND hard scratch because of the titanium outer shell.I've dropped it many times and it still looks like it just came out of the package. There's really only one problem I had with it, and that is that it requires Itunes 7.0 or higher, which took kind of a long time for me to download on my computer (if you have broadband, than it should be no problem downloading.). Besides that one con, I think this device is Flawless, take my word for it. This MP3 player is completly worth your money.

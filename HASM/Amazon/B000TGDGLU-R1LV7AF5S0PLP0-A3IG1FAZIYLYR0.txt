Title: Delonghi 7707 Oil Filled Heater
Content:
I have owned a similar DeLonghi heater for 14 years which has been fantastic, so I decided to purchase a new one  which I planned to use in my home office. I have had the 7707 for about two weeks now, and I have decided I will be returning it. It functions just as good as the older heater, but it gives off this very potent oil type smell. Being that I work in my home office all day, and not knowing what is causing this smell, I am choosing not to be breathing this all day in an enclosed area. When I first turned it I didn't think much of as I thought it was just an oil coating or something on the heater which would burn off after a day or so, which is why I have kept it for two weeks, but it us still just as strong and the smell is not limited to my home office. 
Very disappointed.

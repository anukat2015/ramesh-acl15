Title: The good and the bad of it.
Content:
Stylish, sleak and complete. When I was in the market for a new coffemaker, the features, design and Cuisinart reputation attracted me right to this machine. However, one critical element to the best cup of coffee is lacking. The thermal pot just doesn't keep the coffee hot. After about 45 minutes the best you'll get is luke warm, over an hour its tepid and much over that its down right cold. Not exactly the "keep the
coffee hot for hours." promised in the user manual. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it either since the machine automatically shuts off immediately after completing the brewing cycle. 
On a lighter note, the clean up process is no where near as drastic as mentioned by some other reviewers. A clean pot is a necessity for a great cup of coffee and this particular unit, is extremely well designed to allow easy removal of all critical parts for quick and thorough cleaning. I also love the fact the machine has a water filter.

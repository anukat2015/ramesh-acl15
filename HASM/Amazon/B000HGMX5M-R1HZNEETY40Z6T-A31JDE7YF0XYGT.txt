Title: Excellent Digital
Content:
I love this camera.  I have several small digital's (Pentax A-10 and W10) but wanted something to replace my Nikon 8008 film camera.  The D80 is the ticket.  All of my AF Nikon lenses work with this camera, so I could save money and purchase this model instead of a cheaper one.  Bonus; the camera is so easy to learn to use.

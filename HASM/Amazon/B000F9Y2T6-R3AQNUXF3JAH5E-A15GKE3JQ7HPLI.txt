Title: Bissell Flip It
Content:
Recently purchased to replace the one I had for many years. It's great for all the floors in my home, mostly oak wood, shiny tile and matte tile. I remember the first time I used it when it first came out and although I thought my floors were clean, the squeegee and the suction pulled up all the hidden gunk in between the floor boards, and I was emptying mud from the collection tank. It also left no streaks or spots. Yes, there are some drips and drops when finishing, but it's worth the wipe up for the clean it achieves.

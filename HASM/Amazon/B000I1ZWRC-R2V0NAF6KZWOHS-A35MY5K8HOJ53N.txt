Title: Great for travel
Content:
I love this camera!!! I noticed many people saying the same in all the comments I read, and after purchasing the camera and using it for the past 3 months I absolutely agree with them all. I LOVE this camera! Its easy to operate (especially for a beginner as myself) and light enough for people transitioning from a point-&-shoot camera. The sensor cleaning is very helpful (particularly when one travels to areas where there are a lot of dirt roads). The software that comes along with the camera kit is also easy to use and a great organizational tool. 
Now I need to look for a new lens, the one that comes with the kit does not have a far enough range for me, and you will definitely need more if you travel much. 
Cameta Camera was super fast in shipping the camera so a big thumbs up for them.

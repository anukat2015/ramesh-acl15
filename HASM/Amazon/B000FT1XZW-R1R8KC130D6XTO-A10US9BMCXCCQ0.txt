Title: DeLonghi heater
Content:
Our DeLonghi heater has been working great.  Our heat pump went out in a spare room; it was really cold weather.  When heater came, we plugged in heater with both lo and hi going.  In minutes, the room was warmer; soon, we turned off the hi heat and let the lo take over.  We have had an old DeLonghi for twenty years or so.  The whole family has used it from time to time.  This new one is just as good and seems like it cost less than our old, original heater.  If we ever need another, DeLonghi is what we are buying.

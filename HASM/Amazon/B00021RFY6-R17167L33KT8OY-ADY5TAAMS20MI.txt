Title: Love it
Content:
The cleaning is quick and easy, and the coffee is delicious! 
As many others have said, this is the best cup of coffee I've ever made! Makes the perfect half caff/half decaf coffee ever. The coffee stays hot for hours, especially if you choose the "1-4 cup" option, which double-heats the coffee no matter how many cups you're brewing.
If you're looking for a new gadget and great cup of coffee, look no further.

Title: My husband & I made a bet...
Content:
...about how long the basket latch would last. 
The basket door is latched by a thin fin of the filter basket that's supposed to sit in a slot on a nubbin of plastic sticking out from the machine. What a massive, massive pain this is. *Really* massive. The nubbin of plastic is simply too small, and the slot too shallow, for the thing to hold. No matter how careful you are, the basket pops open again & again. Try to close the top and the basket door pops. Sometimes the basket door slips open while the coffee is brewing. I imagine this could get pretty exciting.(!)
The drip pause feature works about 1/3 of the time.
I'm pretty tolerant of quirky appliances but every time I make coffee these two things make me wish we'd bought something else. 
On the positive side: 
-the carafe keeps the coffee hot for a long time. Nice job!
-there's a sweet little hole on the back of the fill area to keep you from overfilling--I feel I'd have to be asleep to not notice if water were pouring out the back. 
-the timer is easy to set.
We have other Cuisinart appliances that we like a lot. This one is just a design dud.

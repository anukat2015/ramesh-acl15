Title: Great Player at a Great Price!
Content:
You really can't beat this player, especially for the price!  I was using a Sony Net-MD player and the issue for me was space.  MiniDisks just didn't hold enough.  With 16GB on the player and another 16GB or more in the SD slot, I can put all my songs and podcasts on the player.  The negative comments I have seen about the sd slot are not an issue for me.  I just use the SD cards for podcasts and the player's memory for music.
The sound is fantastic, every bit as good as the Sony, which was known for good sound.  There is plenty of volume and the equalizer function is nice for tailoring the sound to whatever headphone or earphone you are using.
If you are looking for a good inexpensive way to protect your Zen, I would recommend bestskinsever.com - unbaetable protection at a ridiculously low price.

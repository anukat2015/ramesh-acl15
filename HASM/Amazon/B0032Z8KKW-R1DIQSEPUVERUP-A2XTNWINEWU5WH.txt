Title: Great
Content:
I would like to say this is a great laptop.  I am really enjoying my new laptop.  It is very fast, looks good, and the 500 gb hdd and 4gb of ram are more than enough.  I put it to the test and tryed to make it slow down and ran three different movies at the same time and it never slowed down.  Of course you could not understand them because they were all running but the speed is great and the processor is pretty good.  The only problem that I found with this computer is the battery it only last about two hours, but that is a quick and easy fix. Other than that I am pretty well pleased.

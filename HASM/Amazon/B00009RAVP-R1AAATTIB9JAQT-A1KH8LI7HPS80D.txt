Title: An AMAZING Heater that saves me money!
Content:
I cannot stand gas heating; too expense and drys out the air, now who wants that?  Welcome to the smart heating with the Soleus Air MS-09 Oscillating Radiant Heater.  Why heat your entire home and waste money, went you can be warmer by only heating the parts of your home you actually use.  
More importantly, I am FINALLY warm, without drying out the air in my home.  One thing I have never like with gas heat is it takes all the humidity out of the air.  What's the problem?  Winter months are dry to begin with and your skin begins to quickly feel it.  
By using the Soleus Air MS-09 Oscillating Radiant Heater, it saves me money and my skin...HIGHLY Recommend!

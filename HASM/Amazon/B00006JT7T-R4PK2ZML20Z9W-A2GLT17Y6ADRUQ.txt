Title: Great Heater since 2005
Content:
I bought this in October 2005.  It heats a small room to almost TOO hot.  I have used it in every room in the house at one time or another.  Last week, I noticed I only have the "low" speed.  The "high" seems to have stopped working.  On low, the heat doesn't radiate very far.  I live on the high setting (just for distance).  You can't beat the thermostat.  I did not have any trouble syncing it...just read the directions.  I am would replace this again in a heart beat except for the current price.  I bought this on a special for $35 at the time.  It's hard to pay almost double for it now.  BUT, it is likely worth every penny if you want a great heater with thermostatic control for a bedroom or small living room.

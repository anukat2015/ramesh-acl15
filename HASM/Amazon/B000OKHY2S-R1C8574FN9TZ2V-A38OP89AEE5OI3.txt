Title: Good
Content:
Instead of using a fan blowing HOT or WARM air to your face, this product will blow COMFORTABLE air, not COOL or COLD. If you put 2 or 3 trays of ice cubes, It blows out much more COMFORTABLE air. It must blow DIRECTLY to you in order to feel more comfortable. Good idea to cool a work table or computer table.If you expect this product to cool down your room, you will be disapointed. It uses approx 60 watts of electricity

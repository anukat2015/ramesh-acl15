Title: What I want, when I want, where I want!
Content:
I love this product. Owning over 2000 cds it really is easy to load music and play what I want, when and where I want. The software is excellent and the sound quality is great. Wish that it could rip directly from a CD, and having to charge it with the computer is a bit of a drag but does not offset my enthusiasm. 
   Optional outlet charger should be included as an incentive to buy the product. Apple could easily afford to do this. However, I am thrilled with how easy it is to use and carry around. Lose the tinny earbuds and upgrade to better hearing as soon as possible and you won't be disappointed that you did so. 
   I really recommend this 30 gig unit; it holds over 7,000 songs and you can edit music easily to change songs around should you have it fully loaded. Would recommend that you learn to manage your itunes manually as soon as practicable as it gives you the best controll over what you load into the unit.

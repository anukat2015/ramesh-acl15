Title: A must have
Content:
This camera is simply an excellent photographic tool. I think it is a camera each photo amateur should have. The image quality is superb, providing you use other lens. The kit lens is ...ok. And OK is an overstatement. But is you use it with the 80$ 50mm 1.8 the image quality is unbelievable. The controls are good and very simple to use.Battery life is excellent too. Maybe the viewfinder could be better but for this price I do not think you have any other camera that is better than this one. It is a great camera to learn on and if you invest in better lenses you will unleash the potential of that sensor and image processor.
Buy it with no hesitation but I would recommend buying it without the lens (body only) and buy the 50mm 1.8 lens.

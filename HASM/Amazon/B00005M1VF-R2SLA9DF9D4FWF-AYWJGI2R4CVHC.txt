Title: Not a good experience
Content:
Based on the other high reviews, it seems this may very well be a great coffeemaker.  Unfortunately, my experience with two of these machines was not good.  Both were defective.
I returned the first machine because it would not hold water.  It gushed OUT of the bottom of the unit.  I returned the replacement machine because it had the opposite problem -- the water stayed IN the unit.  I was not inclined to try it a third time so I opted for a different brand & model.  
I do think this was a fluke.  Cuisinart is usually a very reliable brand.  My experience, although frustrating (and I really hate re-packaging things and standing in line at the post office to return them), was not terrible.  I would not let this sour my opinion or decline to try other products from them in the future.

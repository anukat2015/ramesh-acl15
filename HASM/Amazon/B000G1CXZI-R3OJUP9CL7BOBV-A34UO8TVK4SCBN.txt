Title: DeLonghi Heater
Content:
I've had this heater a month now and it works great. I use it in a rather large bathroom with high ceilings. The best thing about the heater is the timer. I set it to go on about 1 hour before we have to get up and the bathroom is nice and warm. The heater is small enough not to get in the way and big enough to warm any closed in room. A great product that I would definitely buy again.

Title: Fast and easy!!
Content:
I have been using this new BUNN My cafe for several weeks and I really like it.  It keeps the water hot all the time so when your ready to make a cup of coffee or tea it's ready instantly. My wife likes tea and I drink coffee so the tea setting works great for her and the unit comes with two Pod holders so we make one for coffee and the other Tea. It's and expensive unit but really has a commercial quality look and feel.  I would recommend this to the busy family always on the GO!!

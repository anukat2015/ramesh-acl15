I LOVE this player,this is my first!! I just plugged it into my computer to charge it, then just clicked and dragged songs from my media player library!! And I haven't even installed the program CD it came with yet, it is SO EASY!
The display is beautiful, and the controls couldn't be easier,even when you're not looking, the sound is Amazing for such a small clip on.
I use it to work out, I've charged it once and it has stayed charged throughout the month (I work out 3x a week!).  
I would recommend this to anyone, even my dad who is technology challenged can handle this :)

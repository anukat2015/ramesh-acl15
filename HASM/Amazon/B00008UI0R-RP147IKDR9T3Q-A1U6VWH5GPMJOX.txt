Title: pleasantly surprised
Content:
I thought I had to spend $800 to get a good vacuum.  My friend did all the research and had bought this one, so I did too. I am so happy with it, it makes me want to vacuum, which is very unusual!  The suction power is what gives it it's edge. It is easy to use and although a bit heavy,(30lbs?)it rolls around following you so you dont really have to pick it up much. I highly encourage anyone to buy this product.

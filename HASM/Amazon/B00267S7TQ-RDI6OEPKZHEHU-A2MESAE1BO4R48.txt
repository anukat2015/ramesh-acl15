Title: D90 quality in D3000 body for little more $
Content:
Highly recommended.  If you are new to SLR/DSLR and looking for a entry-level DSLR to begin with, then Nikon D5000 will give you Nikon D90 or Canon T1i picture quality for only little extra $ on top of entry entry DSLR Nikon D3000 or Canon XS.  I really believe the extra $ is well spent for the picture quality coming out from Nikon D5000 especially in low light condition or indoor.  A lot of people against it due to missing build-in moter to AF the non-CPU lens,  which is not really a major issue to most of the new entry DSLR users if they do not have old lens on hand.  In adiition, there is no reason that the D5000 LCD is not good enough if all Nikon D3000/D40/D60 and Canon XS/XS1 LCDs can provide you good picture viewing results.  That's why the lower resuolution LCD display than D90 and T1i display LCD is not bothering me too much.  However, the picture quality is much better than Nikon D3000/D40 or Canon XS/XSi and even up against Nikon D90 or Canon T1i picture quality, which is the super value come and shine from D5000.
Please check dpreview.com and see the Canon Rebel T1i review.  The professional reviewer even mentioned the Nikon D5000 provide great picture quality even compared to Cannon T1i.  You cannot go wrong with D5000 unless you have a lot of older lens from previous SLR/DSLR needed built-in motor body or you are using more D90 features instead of P&S replacement, then D90 might be better way to go. 
Otherwise, skip Nikon D3000 or Canon XS/XSi and go for Nikon D5000.  It is the best vaule entry DSLR if you are looking for both better picture quality and greater user friendly unit.

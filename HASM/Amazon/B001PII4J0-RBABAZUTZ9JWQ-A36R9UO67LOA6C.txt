Title: Just Crashed!!!
Content:
I bought this Sony Vaio after having own othe Vaio laptops for a long time and being worry free.  But with this one, after just six months of use, it just stop working.  Took it to the local authorized Sony dealer and they told me the mother card was damaged and that the repair was going to cost almost the same as this laptop cost me.  Since I Bought it from outside the US, I've been having trouble getting a second oppinion.  Too bad for a product like this one.

Title: Superb value for the price
Content:
For the value this is the best vacuum out there. I have previously purchased the DC17 Dyson (too expensive for what you get, it was easy to switch to the wand but to me not worth the price difference and it sucks just as well), the Bissell Healthy home (super duper heavy with no self propelling, and extremely hard to empty, you always have to use your hands). So after long reserach and product reviews i decided to opt for this vaccuum. The suction is superb, it sucks the dirt and sand right out of the carpet (even though i do not use shoes in the house). The vacuum is also easy to push and pull (i am a healthy 39 year old and i could not vacuum with the bissel healthy home). This vacuum is extremely easy to empy with no hands getting dirty. Now the cons: The brush bar never turns off (no button for it), you have to make sure that the basket is seated properly because it can be easly inserted inproperly. The section where you plug in the house can disconnect from the vacuum if you did not put it on tight, and the dust will go in your room instead of the canister. Besides these minor things i rated this vacuum a 5 star due to the price and value.

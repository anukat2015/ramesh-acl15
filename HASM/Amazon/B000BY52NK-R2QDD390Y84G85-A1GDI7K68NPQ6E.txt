Title: D200 Review
Content:
This will be a short and succinct initial review of the Nikon D200 Camera.
The D200 is my upgrade to my (now backup) Nikon D50. Most camera people already know that if your are a Nikon person: buy Nikon; if you are a Canon person: buy Canon. My quick discussion will not address the alternative choice to choose another camera maker.
The D300 is out and so is the D700; yet, Nikon still manufactures and sells the D200. Why would you opt for this camera over the newer models? I cannot lie: There is nothing the D200 can't do that those more expensive and newer cameras can do -- except megapixels (10 vs 12). 
I will say this once: You Are Shooting RAW aren't you?
If yes, then my previous paragraph is succinct enough.
If no, then the nuances and menu options and myriad labyrinths of roundabout searching for more control of your shots will have you befuddled in no time on all these cameras. The D90, D80, D70, D60, D50, D40 have scene control modes that might justifiably satisfy all your shooting needs. I personally find the modes on my D50 totally useless and use it in P (program), A (aperture priority mode), or M (manual) mode always. I'd love it if Nikon made an entry level DSLR with these three modes only as an entry level camera without having to fight with all the "scene sensing modes" built into the camera.
Back to the D200. What I love about this machine is the ease of access to all (at least the main) controls of the camera on dials, toggle switches, and buttons on the camera body, without having to search through arcane menus to edit the controls. (The only control I use that HAS to be accessed through the GUI is the "Image Optimization --> Sharpening" control.
If you are shooting RAW (as most pro-sumers and Pros are ought to be) then these nitpicks are meaningless.
Here is my advice to any D90 to D40 user: if you are considering upgrading to a Pro level Nikon please condsider first: Shoot RAW for at least 1 Year. Next, upgrade your glass (using Nikkor lenses for forward compatibility), and take a photo developing and retouching course using digital tools (i.e., photoshop, lightroom, apple aperture, etc.)
If you aren't shooting RAW then this camera simply isn't for you.
And I would say that about any camera regardless of manufacturer that costs over $600.
Good day,

Title: I love my Shuffle!
Content:
I've owned my silver iPod Shuffle (G2) for about a year and a half now, and have used it extensively. I primarily use it when working out, and love the unassuming size and weight of this mp3 player. It holds enough music for more than one workout, and the battery seems to last forever! It is so light, I just clip it to the silver chain I wear around my neck and it pretty much stays out of the way. It's heavy enough not to flop around, but light enough for me not to really notice it. I don't need a screen on it to show me the song/etc., because I know what's on it and where it is in the loop. My biggest complaint is with the headphones. I would have liked to see Apple include a more workout-friendly and comfortable set of earbuds. But with the new price for this, it is a GREAT value and you can pick up whatever headphones work best for you. I bought my wife one from Wal-Mart for $49, and it came with a $15 iTunes gift card! 
Tip: set it for circular play and not shuffle, and you can easy move through songs to the one you want.

Title: not as good as it seems! this thing is EMBARASSING
Content:
this is a great player in terms of battery time, price, syncing audio, video, FM player, awesome! however, the organization and playing capabilities are the WORST i've seen. 
1) once the music is in your player, you cannot edit albums, artist names, NOTHING. you have to sync the music back to your computer, change the name and then sync it back. but wait! if you change the name of the artist, you now have the old and new artist name in your player, silly you! don't forget to delete everything you've sync'd (total pain in the ***).
2) if you have only one song from an album, the player plays that song, then stops. no continuous play for you! you better be glued to the player to make the 5 clicks it takes to play the next album (which is really awesome when you're driving a car), or you better take the day off and settle down and spend 38 hours making individual playlists for each and every single artist because that's the ONLY way to play all the songs from one artist. 
so i say, don't buy an ipod, but don't buy a creative zen either. the cowons are way better.

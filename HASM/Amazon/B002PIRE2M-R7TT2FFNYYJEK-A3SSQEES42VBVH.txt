Title: Goldilocks Machine
Content:
I purchased this after weighing the pros and cons of the big-screen 7 pounders and the tiny screen 2+ pounders. I liked the horsepower of the bigger units but did not want to lug a boat anchor around all of the time. Once I looked at the true netbooks I quickly realized that (for me) the 9" screens and small keyboards were just too tiny to do functional word processing and spreadheet manipulation. Plus, I am not a big fan of the Atom processors. But to each their own.
I settled on this because it has a reasonably powered Celeron dual-core processor and the 11+ inch widescreen. At just over 3 pounds this is the perfect compromise for me. I did not upgrade beyond the provided 2GB of RAM. The installed and included Win7 runs very smoothly. I installed MS Office 2007 and was pleasantly surprised at how peppy everything felt. The flat keys on the full-size keyboard took a bit of getting used to since I normally use keyboards with the scalloped indentations. Battery life has been prety close to what is stated. I know I have used it for at least 5 hours on one charge.
Since this has no CD/DVD drive, I did find it necessary to buy an external drive. I bought one for about $75 (probably could get one cheaper but I needed it for a trip). If you need one, I recommend a drive that draws power directly from the notebook.
I also bought the 12" Targus notebook sleeve--the one with the external pocket. The AC adapter for the notebook and my wireless optical notebook mouse will both fit in there. The notebook fits perfectly into the main pouch.
All in all, a great little machine.

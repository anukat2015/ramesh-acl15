Title: Pleasantly surprised
Content:
I was looking for a replacement machine after my Dell XPS M1330 unexpectedly died on me. I was initially primarily looking at netbooks, especially the ASUS Eee PC line but wanted more power, while maintaining the light and small form factor at the same time.  I happened to stumble across the machine upon a recommendation from a friend.  I have been using it for about a month now and am extremely pleased.  Windows 7 runs very smooth, and almost all of my applications run without problems.  I am able to play movies without skipping and ouput them to my HDTV via the HDMI output, which was an important feature for me.  The screen is excellent as well.  
I have two complaints.  The mouse is difficult to use and I am quite prone to accidental "double clicks" while moving the mouse around.  I may try to get an external mouse, but this is somewhat annoying.  Also, the space bar is quite flimsy and is not always responsive when I type, which is also annoying when typing out lengthy papers for school.

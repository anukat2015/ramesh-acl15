Title: Pretty good, haven't gone back to film--yet
Content:
There are a lot of things I dislike about digital SLRs.  
I've been a big fan of 35mm black and white and color slide film for years.  With film, I get very graceful degradation (grain).  With digital, low light noise is not as pleasing as pushed 400-speed film. I also seem to get more chromatic aberration with digital.  Finally, I really dislike the smaller sensor on digital SLRs.  It makes all my lenses more telephoto, and increases my depth of field quite a bit.  I miss how my 50mm/1.8 EF lens looked wide open; the ability to really blur the immediate background came in handy.
It takes an impressive digital SLR to make up for these issues.  The XTi has been my first digital SLR, and I haven't yet gone back to film.  Besides the convenience of processing (with Lightroom), the XTi performs well.  Its low-light sensitivity, on-camera JPG processing, form factor, and interface all work well for me.  The biggest feature I'm missing is a decent spot metering mode.  I still break out my Pentax spotmeter (1 degree) occasionally--although with digital, it is just not as much fun as using the zone system and waiting for the negatives.

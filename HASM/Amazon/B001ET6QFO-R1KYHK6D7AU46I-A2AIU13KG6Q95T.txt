Title: 1st dslr and happy with choice
Content:
I purchased this based on word of mouth references as well as online references. It IS a different ballgame from the P&S format I was used to but I knew this going in. It is fairly intuitive and any new owner just needs to take the time to understand all its capabilities. The camera arrived okay but I was a little concerned; the camera and lens were packaged securely in the Canon box but that box was so loosely packaged in the shipment box from Amazon that it was literally bouncing around like a rattle inside (not good at all for an expensive photo item!) but it seems to have survived okay. What I have learned now is I should have purchased the body only and shopped for better glass. While the kit lens is adaquate it is not as good as I wanted for this body. All in all I give the body two thumbs up!!!

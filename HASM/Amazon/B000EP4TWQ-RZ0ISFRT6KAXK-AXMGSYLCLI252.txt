Title: Oh GOD------
Content:
Oh GOD is right!
DON'T BUY THIS IPOD!
I purchased one a couple months ago...and this is the story:
The box arrived at 3:30 AM - 3 in the morning! I rolled out of bed and sleepily opened the front door. A very irate looking UPS man thrust the box into my arms and said "I hope you choke on it!" Needless to say, I was very perturbed. I put the box down and fell back asleep. I opened the box that morning, the sunshine flooding my house. I remove the iPod from the packaging and a very disturbing odor filled my olfactory organs...it stank like whitefish! I gagged and dropped the fishy piece of electronics. After vomiting 6 times, I cautiously placed the bad-smelling iPod back into it's lair. I was very very disappointed! I spent the whole day staring out the window while some scratched CD played some old Beatles tunes. My day was ruined...my life no better. I called UPS and informed them of my "situation." They promised to come back and return it. They did come back, 4 weeks later! My whole house stank of spoiled whitefish! Even the mailman dared not step in the vicinity of my abode. I never got my new iPod and am not sure if I even want a new one...all I know is that if not for a wonderful product called EnviroClear, a odor-eliminating spray, my life would have been ruined. Indeed. EnviroClear saved my life!
PS---Don't buy an iPod, unless you like spoiled whitefish!

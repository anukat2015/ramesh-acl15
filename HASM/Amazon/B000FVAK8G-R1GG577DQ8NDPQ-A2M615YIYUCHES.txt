Title: Good for bedroom
Content:
If you are looking to heat up a fairly open space i.e. living room, den, or family room do not get this heater.  But if you want to heat up your bedroom for those cold nights then this is the heater for you.  It heats up the room without cooking you.  The digital thermostat is nice, I like to set it at 72 for a moderately toasty feel.  If 72 is your chosen temperature what this unit does is raise the temperature to 74 then shut off then turn back on at 70, so basically you will have a constant gradual 4 degree swing.  
The unit is heavy, so storage may be a problem for some but overall it does what it is supposed to do.

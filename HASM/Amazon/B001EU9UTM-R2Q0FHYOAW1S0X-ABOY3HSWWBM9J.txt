Title: A bargain that works great
Content:
I bought this machine in February 2010 at Target. I had reservations about buying a low end machine from a maker known for it's price point products. Not to worry. It has exceeded my expectations in every way. Everything worked perfectly out of the box. 
The unit warms up in just a couple of minutes and makes nice espresso, assuming you are using a quality coffee to begin with. It produced adequate crema and has low suspended solids, so the portafilter is doing it's job. In my opinion, the espresso I get from the Mr. Coffee ECMP50 is better than I typically get from the coffee chain stores and nearly as good as the best from a recent trip to Northern Italy. Maybe with more experience, I can equal the Italian espresso experience... I think the machine is up to it.
The steamer works well for milk steaming and frothing. There may be better on the market, but this one has no obvious shortcomings. Well, maybe one.. the rubber tip of the frothing wand is not easy to remove for cleaning.
There is a "shelf" on the top which gets warm after 20 minutes or so and is a handy place for the tamper and other items. I suppose it would warm cups, but I'm not patient enough to turn it on a half hour before I need it.
It is quiet enough, but being a light weight unit, it vibrates when the pump is running, so you need to hold the cup(s) still while it is brewing. I solved the problem with a piece of rubber shelf/drawer liner. Shelf liner works great on the top shelf too.
I've had no leaks or other problems. I would recommend it and would buy another as it seems to be a terrific bargain which does what it is designed to do with excellence. I'll change my rating to 5 stars if it holds up for a year or so.

Title: Love this Camera!
Content:
I'm seriously just a beginner. So If you know a lot about a camera, this might not be the review for you. For me, as a beginner, this is an amazing camera. It's taken beautiful pictures. My only suggestion to someone buying this camera who doesnt know about camera, would be to buy a canon 50d book with it. The manual is a little hard to read. Now that I'm getting used to all the functions, I'm just ammazed at what it can do. I couldnt be more pleased with this purchase!

Title: Average Vacuum
Content:
When I was looking for a replacement for my great old Hoover I had for years, the Bissell Healthy Home was rated very high. Since I have a multiple pet household I was torn between the Bissell and the Dyson. I could not see paying that much for a Dyson so I bought the Bissell. It was great for the first couple of months, after that, it is no better or worse than any other vacuum. 
My one major complaint about this vacuum is it does not have a well balanced design and falls over backwards if I stretch the hose out any distance. I am not talking about stretched to the max, but just past the normal length.
Overall it is about average and I will not buy a Bissell in the future.

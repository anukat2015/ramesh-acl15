Title: Don't let others talk you out of this - It is this best!
Content:
I'm a techno guy and have a lot of gadgets, but this is the best that I have had.  It even has me thinking about switching over to apple/mac stuff.  It works and does every thing I want it to do the way that I want it to.  I like to use audible.com and they give you $100 credit toward an mini-ipod with a year membership.  I love that I can fit all my audio books on this thing and not even think about space.  I've had it for a week and it just works really well.  And the controls are just fun to use.  Fun and works great, get it and enjoy the cutting edge of portable players.

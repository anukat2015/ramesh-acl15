Title: Makes coffee; but design is complete garbage
Content:
After decades of making coffee pots, you would think that Mr. Coffee would figure out how to make a pot and lid that doesn't drip all over the counter as you pour coffee into your cup.  The part of the lid over the lip of the pouring area catches the coffee and drips it over the side and onto the counter.
The coffee doesn't stay very warm.  If you expect to brew a pot and pour a cup anytime after a half-hour you will get a luke-warm cup.  Our last Mr. Coffee didn't have this problem.
If your paper filters are not COMPLETELY tucked into the side of the basket, the water will catch the edge of the filter and fold it inward.  The grounds then float over the top on the filter and into the pot.  Super.
Good things?  Let's see...  A white cord; easy to clean; lid doesn't stain very quickly (like others do); brews fairly fast; quiet; timer is easy to set; not completely hideous to look at.
I would pass on this coffee maker.  It's annoying to have to clean up the coffee drips and not be able to get a hot cup of coffee after you are done with your first cup.

Title: Works well for me
Content:
I'm very pleased with this coffee maker. I especially like the removable water tank. I use filtered water so I don't need to worry about the unit's filtering system, which, honestly, seems a little cheesy for such a nice unit anyway. My only criticism with this unit, and with most coffee makers in general, is that it doesn't produce coffee that is hot enough for my taste. I usually have to microwave the cup of coffee for 30 seconds to get it hot enough for me. I have yet to find a machine, though, that can produce really hot coffee. Perhaps this is the downside of of rapid brewing.
The carafe does dribble a little, as others have mentioned, but usually just when I'm pouring out the last cup. This is really no big deal for me, I just pour the last cup over the sink so it doesn't make a mess on the countertop. The carafe keeps coffee hot for a long time. The digital display is pleasant, but not exactly intuitive. This unit requires keeping the instructions nearby when time changes are required.
Overall it's a good device that I'm pleased with. It's very attractive and the quality of construction is evident for the most part. I like being able to remove nearly all it's parts for cleaning. I won't need to buy another coffee maker for several years, so despite it's steep cost compared with others, it will last a good, long time.

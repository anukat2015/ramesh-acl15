Title: Very good--most of the time
Content:
The heater works very well--most of the time. I use it for extended periods to heat my small trailer and once in a while it seems to get overwhelmed and stops working. As per the directions, I unplug it for a while and after 10 minutes or so it starts working again--most of the time.... Sometimes it takes longer than 10 minutes.... I'm not sure why. All in all, I'm glad it's here--most of the time.

Title: Great and easy camera
Content:
This is a great camera--smaller than other SLR's, great pictures, good response and easy to learn/use.  Only complaint is the lens cap--I wish that it was somehow connected to the camera.  I'm constantly taking it off in a rush to catch a picture of dogs or kids in action and then I have to remember where I left it.  But, I knew this about the camera when I bought it and it didn't keep me from purchasing it.

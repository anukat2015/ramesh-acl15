Title: Do not buy from this company
Content:
This company makes products that are useless.  Unfortunately I did not read the other reviews before purchasing from them but now am experiencing first hand there shoddy workmanship, if you could even give them that.  Used it for two days and worked ok, now just blows hot air.  now I have to deal with all the hassle of returning, which I can probably only exchange it for another lemon.  These products are a waste of money and given all the other  negative feedback, this company should be reported to the better business bureau if they haven't already

Title: Not impressed.
Content:
I bought this vacuum based on the Electrolux reputation (we have a 55-year-old Electrolux at the cabin that still works!), and I am very disappointed.  I had heard that Kirby vacuums go through belts like crazy but rarely would you ever change one on an Electrolux.  The Kirby I've had for 5 years is using the original belt.  I've gone through 2 belts on this Electrolux in a couple of months!  I wish I could return it.

Title: not efficient
Content:
For Product Features it states that it uses 30% less energy than other heaters. Well, guess what. It also puts out less than 30% of the heat than other heaters. They don't want you to know that. That is why they don't tell you the btu output.
It's impossible for a space heater to turn electric energy into heat energy more efficiently. (unless its a heat-pump)
Weather the heater uses tungsten, quartz, ceramic, etc. You still have the same formula: 1 watt = 3.41 btu

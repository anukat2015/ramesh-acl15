Title: Great heater!
Content:
I haven't seen the electric bill yet so I'm giving this heater 5 stars.  I had previously bought one of the propane Reddy Heaters (RLP50VA see my review on that) to heat my garage but that heater was completely unsuitable for that task.  This one is perfect, it heats up the garage quickly and is quiet and clean.  It is a 240v heater and requires a hardwired installation so is a little bit of a pain but I wired everything up and had an electrician friend come check out my work before I turned it on and all was OK.  Needed a 30A dual pole circuit breaker and 10/2 wire along with a junction box and flexible connecting cable but it was worth the effort!  My garage is a garage under (standard Colonial) 26x22 so the ceiling is insulated but nothing else is.  Living in NH, a heated garage for working on the cars is pretty much a necessity and I would recommend this heater highly.

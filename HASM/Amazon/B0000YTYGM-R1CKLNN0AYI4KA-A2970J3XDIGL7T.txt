Title: A capable coffeemaker
Content:
Tired of burnt coffee taste, my wife and I decided to finally break down and buy a coffeemaker with a thermal carafe.  I did the research and, while this isn't the highest rated model I'd read about, it seemed to have the best blend of availability and ease of use.  We've had the coffeemaker for over a month now, making coffee in it every single day, and we've experienced no problems.  No leaking or overflow as some have complained about, we just make sure everything is lined up right and the coffee filter door is fully swung shut.  The brew is good and really quick (it takes just minutes to brew a half pot, which is what we usually do).  The materials of the coffeemaker itself (not the carafe) are surprisingly cheap-feeling, although they have given us no problems (it doesn't feel of a higher quality construction than the free Gevalia coffeemaker we replaced).  That said, the carafe is a piece of engineering genius.  The lid works well to keep the coffee hot and the whole carafe feels high quality.  Overall we're very happy with the purchase and have no complaints so far.  Yes, the beeping "finished brewing" notification is surprisingly loud, but unless you're really picky and high maintenance it shouldn't bother you too much.

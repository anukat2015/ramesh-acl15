Content:
I've been using for about a month this camera and I can only say it is AMAZING!  Before this Nikon I used a Canon Xti which is very good as well but didn't have the video capturing option that I really like.
Something the description of the Nikon D5000 doesn't mention is that the highest video definition is 720p but I can tell that even though it is not full Hd (1080p) the quality is amazing.  I used to record video with point and shoot cameras and this Nikon D5000 is really outstanding!
When I bought it I thought the Vari angle LCD was something I would barely use but today I can say it is very useful specially when taking pictures close to the ground as those of my new dog sleeping over my slippers.  What I don't like about it is that it takes a lot of time focusing so sometimes I just turn off the Autofocus and do it manually and also it takes more time to take pictures.
Both lenses work very nice and they feel very solid; I like them very much.  The VR function (vibration reduction) is very useful when taking videos and when using the zoom specially with low light conditions.
I strongly recommend buying a high speed SD card in order to be able to capture longer videos and capture lots of pictures leaving the shooter pressed down.
Finally I would say I really like the picture and video quality, ease of use, battery charging time, lenses compatibility.
I would like a battery pack for this camera.
Lovable!

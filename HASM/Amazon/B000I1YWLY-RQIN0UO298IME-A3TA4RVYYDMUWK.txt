Title: Best vacuum we've ever had
Content:
We have only had this vacuum for about a month -- not really long enough to provide a thorough rating, especially regarding its durability. The vacuum is used primarily by the house cleaner, who comes every 2 weeks. She uses many different vacuums in many different homes, so can readily make comparisons. She says she really likes this vacuum. It is easier to maneuver than the Hoover junk it replaced, and picks up dirt WAY down in the carpet. The first time I tried it out, I did so in our (carpeted) living room. This room doesn't get much traffic, so the carpet appeared perfectly clean. You can imagine my bewilderment when I saw a white powder in the dirt container; i.e., where did that come from? It then dawned on me that over the years, she had used deodorizer powder on this carpet (you sprinkle it on and vacuum it off). Obviously, the old vacuum was incapable of sucking up the powder that had gotten down to the carpet backing, and it had built up and remained there for years. This Electrolux was getting it out. VERY impressive!
Two other features are equally as impressive: (1) Noise. Despite being very powerful, it is hands down the quietest vacuum we've ever owned. (2) It has features we've never had in any other vacuum, like a 3-height-adjustable power brush and a telescoping wand that makes it easy to clean cobwebs out of corners on the ceiling without using a step stool. And just in general, it is amazingly well engineered.

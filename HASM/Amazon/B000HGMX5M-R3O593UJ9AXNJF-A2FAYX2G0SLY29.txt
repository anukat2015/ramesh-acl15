Title: Serious focusing problems
Content:
Before you buy this camera, Google "D80 autofocus problems".  This camera has major autofocus problems and lots of people are experiencing it.  My next door neighbor has this camera as well and she's having the same problem.  I love all the bells and whistles on the camera and all the different options, but my Kodak Easy Share takes better pictures.
I had a Nikon N70 before I bought the D80 and I loved it.  Based on this experience, I will probably never buy a Nikon again.

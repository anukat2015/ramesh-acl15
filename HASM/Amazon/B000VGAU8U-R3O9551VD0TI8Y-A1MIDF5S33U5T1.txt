Title: Not to Expectations
Content:
I like the look of this coffee maker- and the removeable water tank (no water to spill while filling).  It brews relatively fast, coffee tastes good, but no automatic shutoff!!  The on/off switch feels flimsy and the entire base the pot sits on gets VERY HOT- (not just the warming plate, but the whole bottom, too).  I'll be returning and keep looking....

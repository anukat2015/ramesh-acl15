Title: Complicated
Content:
I have owned this Coffeemaker for one week. I will admit it makes a great cup of coffee and the coffee does not get bitter. BUT, You must follow instructions completely and carefully, or you will have a very hot dangerous mess. 
  The carafe must be closed with dots in a certain position for brewing. You must be sure the carafe is closed completely (dots again) to keep coffee warm. A few times we had the bottom of the filter get stuck and that caused an overflow of hot water and grounds. Once causing a burn. Now I must check the pop-up valve to be sure it is the correct position. There is no shut off button to stop the flow of hot water and hot grounds.  I had a party and it was frustrating teaching everybody to open the coffee pot, much less help by making a pot. I would never make coffee without supervising.
 Too much hassle! Too many overflows and 1 burn.

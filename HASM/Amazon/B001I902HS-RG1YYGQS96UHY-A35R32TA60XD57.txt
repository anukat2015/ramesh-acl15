Title: Exceptional vacuum cleaner!
Content:
I got this a few days ago.  At first I wasn't sure if I liked it or not because honestly, I wish it was a different color.  Anyway, the performance of it has won me over big time.  Before I got this one, I was using 2 vacuums to do my floors and furniture.  Now I can do my furniture, hardwood floors, bathroom floors, furniture AND get under the bed!  It does a great job and I even gave it what I call the "flour test".  I wasn't sure if it had enough suction so I sprinkled about a teaspoon of flour on a low pile carpet we have in our kitchen, and it got it in one swipe without the motor head turned on.  Then I used it on my furniture and wondered if it was getting the cat hair.  When I was done, I used one of those sticky lint removers and I didn't get any fur!  I wasn't sure I would like pulling a cansiter around to do the whole house, but it is worth it when you see all it does and does it quietly.  Totally satisfied and would buy it again.

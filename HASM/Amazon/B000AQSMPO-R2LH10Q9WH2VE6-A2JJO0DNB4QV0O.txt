Title: Makes fresh coffee at home accessible for lazy people!
Content:
Before acquiring a Keurig, drinking a cup of coffee at home basically just wasn't a good use of time. The hassle of grinding beans, brewing a pot (and dumping out all the wasted extra coffee!), cleaning up, etc etc made at-home coffee pretty unappealing. The Keurig, however, is absurdly easy to use and requires no cleanup if you're using "official" k-cups (rather than filling the [optional] k-cup perma-insert with your own coffee/tea). Most people would agree that few things in life are better than a fresh cup of coffee. With the Keurig machine (and the *huge* range of k-cups available now from excellent coffee companies), you can always have a fresh cup brewed for you in about 10 seconds. Nirvana on your counter.

Title: I hate this coffee maker
Content:
I previously owned a Krups with the ProAroma feature, and was very impressed with how good the coffee was.  It started to leak from the water tank, so I bought this item, and regret it.  This model is no better than a very reliable Mr. Coffee I had for about 7 years.  It makes the coffee taste like plastic (after multiple cleanings and running water through the machine without coffee), and it is very user unfriendly and difficult to program.  Also, it often gets bubbles in the side indicator that is supposed to show you how much water you've put in, and so almost every night I have to dump it out and try to start over, or else it's off and I don't have the amount of coffee I thought I would.

Title: Cheaply made
Content:
The one piece that keeps this unit attached firmly to the mounting plate on the wall is a very flimsy piece of plastic.  As soon as I tried to mount it for the first time, the piece snapped.  Now my fancy new thermostat is accented by some fancy new duct tape.  I have a hard time believing this model tested for physical quality.

Content:
i just recieved this product today and i must say that it is amazing i. but i tried installing the software on my desktop but it didnt work so i just synced it up with windows media and it worked just fine. but then i tried to play some movies that i had already on a SD card on it but they werent in the right format so i installed the software on my laptop and hooked up the player and im gonna tell you the conversion software sucks and i would use another conversion software but i dont know what format to convert it into so im just gonna let it do its thing

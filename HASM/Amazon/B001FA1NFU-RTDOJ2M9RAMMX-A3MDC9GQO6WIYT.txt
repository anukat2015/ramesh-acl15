About three years ago, I bought a 30 gig iPod classic with my own money and absolutely loved it. About this time last year, however, I decided that it was time to upgrade. I agonized over what to get. I knew I wanted less memory, since I didn't even use half of the space on my old one, but should I stay with Apple, or try a different, cheaper brand? Since I was asking for it for Christmas and wouldn't be paying for it, I decided to go for the iPod. I love this one so much that I gladly would have payed for it myself and felt that it was worth every penny. The transition on my computer from one iPod to another was surprisingly easy; it took less than half an hour for me to completely set it up. I love all of the little iPod details that I've become accustomed to, like the click wheel. I like the new features too, like shake to shuffle and cover flow (which turned out to be much less annoying than I had feared). There are a few cons, such as when I occasionally drop it or move too fast and it shuffles to another song, or when I turn it to the side and it goes into cover flow, or when it occasionally freezes and won't reset. But overall, it was a very good upgrade from my old one and I would definitely recommend it.

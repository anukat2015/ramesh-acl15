Title: I have two and one is not working as well
Content:
I have two that got about 3 or 4 years ago. I have one in my office and I use it all day (every day of the week) and works great. The other one is at home and about a month after i got it, the button stayed in an odd position, however it worked just fine but now the sensor is not working and it turns off or it thinks you are pressing on it so just changes temperatures. It is odd. Any way the one at work I just love the one at home I hate. So I guess I am 50/50 on this product.

Title: Works great and can cool multiple rooms
Content:
This unit is just right for taking the edge off of a hot day in an otherwise temperate climate (like the Bay Area).  Can cool down one or multiple rooms 5 to 10 degrees.  The output vent fits just right into a sliding door.  Perfect if you don't have the option of installing a higher-output window-mounted unit.  It also runs quiet, indoors and outdoors.

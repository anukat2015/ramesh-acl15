Title: powerful little cleaner
Content:
This little vacuum has great suction and the bag holds a lot of debris for its size.  I needed something to do above the floor cleaning, such as the car, lampshades, books, etc.  It does the job very well.  It is a little loud, but not nearly as bad as the Kirby that we have for everything else.
The two-way dusting brush isn't very good, it leaves black marks on the baseboards and doesn't get into the corners very well.  But I grabbed the dusting brush from the other vacuum and I am all set.  The attachment for pet hair works very well.

Title: Probably got a returned piece...
Content:
Everything was OK except for one thing. The radiator came pre-assembled in the box, an indication that it was probably sold to someone else first and was returned. I have bought this earlier too a couple of times and one has to assemble the wheels etc. oneself. The power cord too was not packed as new. And sure enough,after about 15-20 days we noticed that the the piece was short circuiting somewhere...and one of the power buttons would work unreliably. We got slow in returning the piece and are stuck now. This was the first time Amazon sent us such a piece....so if the same happens with you, be warned.

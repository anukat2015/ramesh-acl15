Title: Not as good as I expected
Content:
Pro-
Goood long battery can be switch
Light
quite and not getting hot just warmmer when runnign geforce card
Lots of connection
Semi fast cpu
nice key in the keyboard
run smooth in older pc games and low setting in some newer game
Cons-
Screen is not good no matter what other said it just too wash out coor and very bad view angle
Mousepad is very cheap and not response well
Not smooth in 1080p video playback, lagging. but is acceptable in 720p
Whenever put the screen down it auto sleep.
A bit over price.

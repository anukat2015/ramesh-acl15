Title: QUICK, NO MESS & DELICIOUS COFFEE
Content:
I have had the Keurig now for about 3 weeks and I love it. I started out with a Senseo (which is now at my work.) Then I was looking into a Tassimo and read the reviews and people kept refering to the Keurig and I had not heard of it before. I went online and looked into the Keurig and I was satisfied with the reviews and the wide selecetion of coffees and teas. I gave it a shot and I love it. It is very fast and simple and there is absolutely no clean up.

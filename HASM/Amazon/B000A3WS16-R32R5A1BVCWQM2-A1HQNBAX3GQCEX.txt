Title: Great product for your money
Content:
I got my ipod last October and I'm really glad I did.  It was my first ipod, let alone mp3 player.  This gadget is a must have if you want music, movies, and photos in one sleek device.  I reccommend getting the white one if you don't want scratches to be as noticeable.  That is one of the problems I have: it scratches pretty easily, the screen especially.  However, the screen is large enough for movie viewing with excellent picture quality.  
Another problem is that you have to buy a wall charger separately.  The box comes with a USB charger and some cheap headphones that don't deliver great sound.  At first, they did, but after a few months I had to turn the volume way up just to hear a song normally.  Also, they hurt your ears after a while.  My advice: buy some other headphones!   
If your old ipod is kind of worn and not functioning like it used to and you want a gadget that can hold your movies, I recommend getting a video ipod.  It is well worth the money!!!

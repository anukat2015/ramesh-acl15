Title: Terrible Vacuum
Content:
Let me start my saying "DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM". I have owned it for two years and it has only worked for about two months. All together it has been in the shop for about 6 months. The wand has been replaced four times because the connection to the powerhead keeps burning out. By burning, I mean that it smells of smoke for a couple of uses and then stops working. My parents have owned an electrolux for 30 years, so I figured I would spend lot more money and get a good vacuum. Well, I was wrong, I actually purchased a $500 Eureka. Save yourself the time and buy a $150 Eureka. Still not the greatest of vacuums, but at least you got what you paid for.

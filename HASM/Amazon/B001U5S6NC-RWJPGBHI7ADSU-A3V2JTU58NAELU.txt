Title: NOT ELIGIBLE FOR WINDOWS 7 UPGRADE
Content:
Right now I am quite annoyed with Amazon for posting that this computer is eligible for a Windows 7 upgrade.  I contacted Acer and I have been informed this computer is NOT eligible, so if that is a reason for you to buy this computer, look for another one and make sure it is- you can't believe it just because Amazon posts it on the item page, apparently.  I have never had any problem with Amazon in the past, so I am surprised by their false advertising.
As for the computer itself, it has had a few issues.  First of all, it cannot find the webcam to be able to use it for video making.  Second, I turned it on today and got a horrible blue screen which my son tells me has to do with factory installed drivers.  I am no computer geek so I really don't know what he is talking about, maybe people reading this will know what I mean.  It has also gone into hibernation and I could not get it out!  Being that I don't know a lot about computers you can take it with a grain of salt, but I may be returning this, I haven't decided yet.  
I am really disappointed because it is very comfortable to use, fairly lightweight, and it doesn't get hot like the old Compaq I have.  I bought it to do simple things, like surf the net, word processing, run Cricut Design Studio, and Adobe Photoshop (which I don't have installed on it yet).  It runs Design Studio just fine, for all of you Cricut users, the screen is ample in size to get a good view of what you're creating. 
I bought it when it was $473.00 which I think is a great price, but now I see there may have been a reason for that!!

Title: Works like a charm!
Content:
I just received this and used it on my ceramic tile floors. The great advantage is that you vacuum an area and then flip the unit over and mop it. It took some getting used to because the suction works great! My floors really got clean and I would recommend this to anyone wanting to save time. I had previously used a Swifer mop and found it so lightweight that it didn't do any deep cleaning of the floor surfaces. Glad I got this!

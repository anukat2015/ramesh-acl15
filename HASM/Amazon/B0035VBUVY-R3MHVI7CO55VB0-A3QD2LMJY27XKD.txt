Title: Good budget notebook
Content:
Just got this today. As a test for the processor and ram I downloaded Wow. It runs at about 23 fps. Which is better than the desktop I had that had an AMD processor. It is a new experience working on Windows 7. It is pretty nice, but will take a little bit to get used too. Over all very satified at the moment.

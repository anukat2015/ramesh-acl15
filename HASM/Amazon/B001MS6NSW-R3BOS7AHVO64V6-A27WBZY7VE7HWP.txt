Title: Excellent hardware. Less than satisfactory customer support.
Content:
It's a SONY Vaio. So it delivers the promised quality and carries on its reputation.
But it's SONY America. I am not happy with their lack of response in regards to my general inquiry about the product to this day. Dell, on the other, has always been responsive and willing to help me for whatever issues. I purchased this Vaio because it happened to be a good deal at the time.
I'd recommend SONY Vaio if you know what you're doing.

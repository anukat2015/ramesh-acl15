Title: LOVE IT!
Content:
I am really happy with my new iPod nano! I've wanted one for a while and I couldn't believe how much this tiny little unit can do. It's been pretty easy to set up and use (although I'm still figuring some of the more advanced things out). I highly recommend it to anyone. The only complaint I have is that I am having a very hard time finding a case for it (mainly becuase I am really picky), but the product itself is aces.

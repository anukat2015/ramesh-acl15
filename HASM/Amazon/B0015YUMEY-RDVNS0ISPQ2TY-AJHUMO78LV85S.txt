Title: A great piece of work
Content:
This is certainly Apple's premier effort so far.  It is compact, yet with a screen just enough longer than the G4 laptop to make a significant difference.  Memory and hard drive space are ample for most users and can be increased at need.  Add a Cinema Display and you've got the virtual equivalent of a desktop, with portability. I've encountered a glitch or two, but Apple's 90 day extendable phone service has been instantaneous and has solved every problem so far. Get's top rating.

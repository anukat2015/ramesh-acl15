Title: BEST GRIND &amp; BREW !
Content:
I have owned EVERY coffee maker that GRINDS &amp; BREWS and I have found that every one except this model is extreamly hard to clean. EVERY part of this coffee maker comes apart and is easily washed. It is excellent and with it's 1-4 cup setting you get the proper strength brew everytime! Another nice thing about this partiicular model is that it serves HOT coffee not lukewarm like some other brands. It also has a charcoal filter and I must say based on years of coffee making experience this is the BEST grind and brew machine available!

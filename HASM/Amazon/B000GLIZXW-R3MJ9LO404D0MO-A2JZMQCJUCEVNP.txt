Title: Love, love, love this thing
Content:
The flames are extraordinarily realistic...the only thing is they cut off at the top and sides in a kind of semi-circular shape that makes it look fake...however, everything folks have said about the fire and logs themselves looking real is absolutely true.  (HINT: If you have an iPhone or iPod Touch, check out the App Store for an app called Ambiance.  There are a few fire sounds on there that are the perfect accompaniment.  Hook up a speaker/dock on the mantle and squint and it's as good as the real thing.)

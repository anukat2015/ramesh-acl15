Title: Great all day long!
Content:
I first saw a Keurig coffee maker when I was visiting someone in the hospital, and fell in love with it. At the time, I didn't realize that they also made home units.  I saw a Keurig at the store, and almost bought it on the spot. Instead, I visited the Keurig website and the B70 model because of the greater water capacity.
I am one who leaves the machine on full time. While a previous reviewer likes the auto-on feature for "morning only" coffee drinkers...that's not me!
First thing on rising, I make a double mug of one of the Extra Bold coffees. I have several favorites (Cowboy Coffee, Jet Fuel, Dark Magic, et al) so I skip around. A little later I have another double mug.
During the day, I generally switch to tea, and at night to herbal teas. I personally go through 6-8 k-cups per day. And when we have guests, the quick recycling time is a great blessing.
I have had this machine more than 2 months, and the "new" hasn't worn off. Don't know how I got along without it.  I have a great variety of coffee and tea flavors on hand for guests. This coffee maker is great!

Title: Great Value and quality for the price
Content:
I read the reviews and did a little research on my own and decided to buy this machine based on past experience with DeLonghi. The coffee is more than hot enough, especially if you use the cup warmer. The time to make the coffee is fine under normal mode and does take quite some time when you use the aroma setting, but it is worth the wait and if you dont want to wait around just set the timer. The pull out design is wonderful and I havent spilled any water since we started using. For those who want stronger coffee take out the enclosed filter basket (which is sized for just enough coffee)and put in a standard paper filter, there is plenty of room to add even the Starbucks recommended amount. Replacement carafes, I have seen them as low as $ 15.00 on Amazon. Bottom line, I am very pleased.

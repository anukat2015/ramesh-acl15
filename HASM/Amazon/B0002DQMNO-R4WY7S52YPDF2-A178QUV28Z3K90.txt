Title: Outlet?
Content:
It heats and installs just fine. However, I bought for the bathroom because it says has an outlet.  The outlet is not a typical 2 prong kind, rather something that looks like a headphone outlet.  Sorry I don't know electrical terminology.  Anyway, you can't plug anything into it as described. Waist of money.

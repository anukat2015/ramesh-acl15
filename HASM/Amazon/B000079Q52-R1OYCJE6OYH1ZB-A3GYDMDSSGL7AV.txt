Title: The future looks bright.
Content:
I live in an old house with 10' ceilings through out, poor insulation, and drafty single pane windows. Wife and I have this set up oscillating in front, in between, and facing us on recliners. This is as we watch TV. It is bright! Too bright on high to watch TV with this thing staring at your face. It is manageable on the low setting and keeps us warm. Am able to turn the thermostat down to 56, in the Indiana winter. 
   Overall I am pleased with this.  It is "cool to the touch" when in use, doesn't get hot. I really like the use of the remote.  Just remember It must be facing you for effect. On a side note mine runs around 450W on low and right at 800W on high. No biggie, I think it's supposed to be 400W at low. Mine also hums a little as it oscillates.

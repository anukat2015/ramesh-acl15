Title: Olympus Evolt E500
Content:
I use to have a Minolta 35mm in the past, but this camera and the lenses that come with the camera is by far the best!!  The pictures are clear and very colorful.  I like to take photos of old churches and old towns or buildings and I use the Sepia setting, it makes the photos look old and antique.  The black and white photo setting takes excellent photos as well.  The viewing screen is larger than other cameras, and clear.  I am not an expert photographer its just a hobby.  This camera is great for beginners and up.  It is so easy to set up and start taking pictures. I recommend that you get the 2GB compactflash card.

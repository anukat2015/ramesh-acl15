Title: good camera
Content:
Replaced my E500. It works much better indoors then the E500 did  and the image stabilization is great. I am able to get good photo results taking hand held pictures of the moon with my older 150mm kit lens and a 1.4x teleconverter attached. The other camera I looked closely (and have used a fair amount) is the canon T1i.  I like the ergonomics/feel of the Olympus. In my opinion, the Canon is a better indoor (i.e. low light camera). It also has a movie mode and a much nicer view finder.I find that the Olympus starts to introduce "noticeable noise" in the picture above ISO 800, I would only use ISO 1600 in an emergency and 3200 is not really usable. That being said the camera takes a better picture out of the box then the canon. I find the color more accurate and pleasing to the eye then the canon and it takes a better outside daytime picture.  The Olympus has the advantage of an articulated lcd viewer ( a feature I did not think I would use but have found it useful) and most of the control dials are lit in the dark another feature I have found much more useful then I anticipated. I am pleased with the camera. I would recommend that if you do  lot of indoor photography not using a flash then the canon (or other non 4/3's camera might be the way to go) otherwise I think the E620 is a very good choice. Lastly,  you should get a hands on feel for what ever camera you are thinking about buying because I think ergonomics have a bigger impact then people often realize.

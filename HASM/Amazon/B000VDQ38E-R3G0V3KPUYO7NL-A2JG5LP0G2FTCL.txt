Title: Astonishing  performance
Content:
I just purchased a top-rated Hoover upright vacuum and thought it was doing the job, but didn't like the dog smell. (We have three cats and a Collie in the house.) Our housecleaner told us about the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser vacuum. I was skeptical and yet intrigued. After reading the Amazon reviews I took a chance and bought one. My "scientific" tryout of the new vac consisted of vacuuming with the new Hoover then with the Bissell (incidentally costing less than half as much). I was astonished at the results! The Bissell not only came up with large amounts of hair but with dirt and sand as well. I could hardly believe my eyes, and immediately ordered a second Bissell from Amazon as I never want to be without one  again.

Title: great little heater
Content:
no complaints ..cheap, and does a geat job!! remember this thing is small, it willnot heat your garage or even a large living room..it does however heat a bathroom or a small bedroom...one consumer review states he puts his feet 6 inches from this heater? i dont know how he can do that without cooking his feet??

Title: A good little heater
Content:
We've used this heater in the two-story addition off the back of our house, both in the 'sun room' on the 2nd floor and the 'mud room' on the 1st floor.  It works like a charm for these small rooms, and is helpful when trying to overwinter plants.  When I run it, I put the heater on a granite tile on the hardwood floor (instead of directly onto the wooden floor).  This is just my over-cautious neuroses: the base of the unit does not ever feel 'hot'.  Follow the manufacturer's directions for spacing and placement.  It can dry the air out quite a bit, so if you are using it in living areas, I would also consider the use of a humidifier.

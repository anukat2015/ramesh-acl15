Title: First time in my life, vacuuming was a pleasure
Content:
Very nice hold position. Weight is mostly on canister, so effortless to vacuum back and forth. Looks and feels like the "iPod of Vacuum Cleaners". 
Does a fine job of the vacuuming. The power floor attachment pulls itself forward a bit which means no shoulder fatigue which I used to get from another vacuum clenaer I had.
Nice size. Not too big, not too small. 
Took me about 90 seconds to put it together for the first time. Pretty much ready to go out of the box. Whole thing is a nice manageable weight too, so you can haul it upstairs of downstairs easily enough.
Great price.

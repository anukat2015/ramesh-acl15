Title: Ideal 1-cup coffeemaker
Content:
I purchased this coffeemaker because I get up several hours earlier for work than my husband and by the time he gets up the big coffeemaker would have already turned off.  This 1-cup coffeemaker is perfect for me because I brew the one cup when I get up and that is all I will drink anyway before heading off to work.  Some others had said the coffee wasn't hot enough, but I drink it right after it's been brewed, so I haven't had that problem.  The cup of coffee won't stay hot because there is no warmer with this machine, but the whole idea is to drink it once it is done brewing, not to let it sit there.

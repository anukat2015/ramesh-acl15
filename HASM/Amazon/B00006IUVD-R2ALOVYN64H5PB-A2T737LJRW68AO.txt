Title: Great Travel Coffeemaker
Content:
We had purchased a Brew 'N Go for a cruise about a year ago, as my husband likes his Starbucks coffee and there are no coffeemakers in rooms on cruise ships.  We liked the coffeemaker so much, we bought one for our parents.  The unit is compact, the brewing is quick, and we augment the metal mesh filter in the unit with a #1 filter to ensure a smoother coffee. If you are a road warrior or want to ensure your own coffee while on vacation, this is the way to go.

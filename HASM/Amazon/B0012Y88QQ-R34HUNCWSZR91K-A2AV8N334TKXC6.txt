Title: very impressive camera!!
Content:
i really love this camera it's my first slr and i'm just stunned with it's amazing performance. clear and crisp looking photos. and especially at low light. the noise doesn't really bothers me 'cause even at iso800, the noise is still acceptable. the kit lens is a bit slow in terms of AF at low light, i'd suggest to get an upgrade as soon as you can. but still, the lens works great for me. i have no complaints with this camera. i think this is one of the best entry level camera we have these days!

Title: to me it's a work of art.
Content:
I would agree with the most of the reviews before me, it's just a nice pc and I love it. I don't want to go into specifics but I'll tell you that every time I use it, I discover something new that I like it.
 About the battery life so what, this is a big laptop, it's not made to be carryed around, so if you are looking for battery life buy a little netbook, it will last 10 hours they say,
Anyway, to me its a great buy and I enjoy it a lot.

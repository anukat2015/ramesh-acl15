Title: Wonderful product
Content:
This coffeemaker is very attractive and produces a flavorful, excellent pot of coffee.  It has all the necessary bells and whistles (delayed brew, coffee-ready signal, auto shut-off).  The only unfavorable comment I have is that pouring the water into the coffeemaker is unnecessarily awkward. I'd love to see an outside indicator for water and an easier-to-use (perhaps larger) water well.  Otherwise, this is a great product.

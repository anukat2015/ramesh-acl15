Title: I hate this horrible piece of junk!
Content:
This vacuum does manage to pick up some pet hair and dirt, so I guess it has that going for it.  But it leaves a lot more behind.  This is a horrible machine.  It's bulky and cumbersome, and I get nothing for my efforts because it seems to have no effect on my carpet. My steam cleaner is always getting clogged with the pet hair this stupid piece of junk leaves behind.  I should have gotten a Dyson when my old, cheap vacuum died.  My husband said it was too expensive, so I bought this awful machine.  I'm such an idiot.  I should have told him to mind his own business and bought the vacuum I wanted. I'd rather live with the dirt and hair than push this thing around. I dread vacuuming because it makes me so angry I'm afraid I might hurt someone. I feel like Bruce Banner.  I'm perfectly normal most of the time, but once I start vacuuming I turn into the Hulk.  I just have to talk about vacuuming and I start to see red.  Why have I lived with this for so long?  I'm getting a Dyson for Christmas.  I don't care if I have to buy it myself.  Actually, I'm at the point where I'd prefer a broom to this piece of garbage.  Horrible!

Title: Perfect iPod For Tweens
Content:
I don't think there is much that I can say which is really "new" about owning an iPod. I just wanted to assure any parents out there that this one is probably the best model for your tween. 
The Nano 4th generation comes in great colors, is light, slim, yet has a big enough screen for your kid to see the album artwork for the songs they are listening to. The controls are big enough for little hands, and my 10 year old loves how you can shuffle a song just by shaking it. (I think that's that cool too:-) 
There are a variety of games available in the iTunes store for the Nano which are age appropriate as well. All in all this is a good investment for the responsible tween in your house who loves music!

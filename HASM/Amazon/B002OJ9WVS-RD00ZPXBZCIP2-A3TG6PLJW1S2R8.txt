Title: SUPERB PERFORMANCE
Content:
I've been doing lots and lots of investigation on what type of vacuum to buy.  I have 2 semi-long furred Siberian Forest cats, hardwood floors, ceramic tile and an area rug.  Never knew what a Miele was.  Went online to see reviews.  Went to several dealers to get educated and even went to an Oreck dealer, which was my second choice because of a low-priced model on sale there.  Light weight and power were important to me.  I used to own a Rainbow and was always extremely satisfied, but due to the price and pulling it around the house (too large), I finally opted for a Miele S4212 Polaris - AND - let me tell you, I was amazed by the power, ease of handling (beneath beds, couch, etc.), ease of storage, low noise.  Even the cats were intrigued and didn't run from it.  My Miele moved around the house effortlessly and I didn't need to use the high settings at all.  The power is almost overkill.  I don't like that the bags are expensive, but I am in love with this machine.  Was originally looking for an upright or electric broom thinking a vacuum following me would get caught on furniture and I'd have to yank and keep moving it.  Not true.  I'm having a love affair with my vacuum.  By the way, in my opinion Consumer Reports does a huge disservice to this company by barely reviewing it at all while recommending a couple of Sears products which are far inferior and very heavy to this baby.  I advise yoU to buy and try.  You will not return it.

Title: Simple to use, basic coffee maker, what I wanted
Content:
Single, wanted a 4-cup brewer.  This arrived within 3 days of ordering, packed well, all in good condition.  Simple on/off switch.  Water container pulls out for cleaning, nice feature.
Glass pot is wide at bottom, narrower at the top, pours well, stands well.  Uses #2 wedge-type filters, I ordered Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100 Count (Pack of 6) by Melitta, they came with the coffee maker.  Fit well into the filter holder.  I have no issues with their quality, coffee filters through fine for my expectations (though others have complained about them).
Only minor weakness is the loose fit of the filter and lid within the glass pot.  The filter actually goes 'in' the glass pot (perfectly fine by me), then the lid goes on top (then place into coffee maker).  The pot lid does not snap on or hold, it simply sits on top.  Note it FITS well, it just does not snap, so you must hold it with your thumb when pouring.  This is stated clearly on a note put into the glass pot (in packaging).
So except for that minor item, I'd have given it a 5 star rating.
I'll add it seems to brew at a good pace, allowing the water to soak thru the coffee, and the window makes it easy to pour water up to your cup level.  I use '3' for a 12oz cup, roughly.

Title: Best Digital SLR for the money
Content:
After four months I am convinced this is the finest digital SLR for this price.  You can pay more, but why?  I got the D200 with the Nikkor 18-200mm lens.  This is Nikon's best wide angle to telephoto zoom lens and it is the camera's weakest link.  I'm surprised that Nikon has priced this camera body for just $1500.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase this camera.

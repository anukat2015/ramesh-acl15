Title: Can't beat 'em
Content:
I've owned several of these coffee makers over the years and they have all served me very well.  I've never experienced the melting plastic issue that another reviewer described.  Two things I do for ease in filling - I make a black mark to indicate the maximum fill capacity (which is slightly higher than the raised line that Black and Decker puts in there) using a permanent marker (Sharpie extra fine).  A small black mark I can see first thing in the morning but that raised line I can not.  And also I fill the coffee maker from my Brita pitcher.  The pitcher has a narrow spout on it that allows for way better aim than a coffee mug.  And I want to use filtered water anyway to prevent mineral build up.

Title: I agree
Content:
I agree with all of the reviewers who really like this machine. It's small, light, has great suction and is versatile on both hard wood floors and rugs. The attachments, however, do seem a little chintzy, maybe to keep the light weight. I guess we shall see in a couple of years how long they last. I used to own a Samsung Quiet Storm, which was much heavier, noisier and was always in need of parts. I think this unit will be a lot better.

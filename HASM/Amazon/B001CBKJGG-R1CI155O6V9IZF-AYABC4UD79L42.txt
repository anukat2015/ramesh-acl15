Title: Canon Rebel XS is a Great Camera
Content:
I love this camera.  I already had one.  My kids gave it to me for Christmas.  My father wanted a Camera and he asked a professional photographer what he would recommend.  He told him the Canon Rebel.  I could have told him that.  So, I ordered one for my dad thru Amazon.com.  The camera was a little slow in shipping but otherwise just great!!!!  We love this camera.  It is so easy to use for the beginner but advanced enough for the professional.  You can not go wrong!!!

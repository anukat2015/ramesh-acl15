Title: Absolutly perfect! You will not be disappointed...ever!
Content:
I have had this camera for over a month now and shot dozens of scenes. It has yet to fail me and the results are wonderful. The colors are so crisp and bright. There are 15 different scene modes available for the less than average camera operator and they are fabulous. I just shot a fireworks display over the weekend and the results were amazing. I've had several people tell me they thought a professional photographer took the photos. That felt good! It's very easy to use right out of the box but yet there is plenty to learn for those that wish to become more advanced. The price is awesome, you can't touch a competitor camera for this price with two lenses. I can't say enough good things about it. Don't hesitate, you'll love it!!

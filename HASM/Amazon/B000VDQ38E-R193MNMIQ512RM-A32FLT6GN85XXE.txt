Title: Absolutely mazing!
Content:
I am in love with my vacuum! We have two big dogs, one who sheds fine little hairs and one who sheds big clumps of fur and until last week it drove me insane. Now, I grab my Bissell and in 15 minutes the hair is gone from the floor, the furniture, the corners, under the bed, the curtains....
The tools are great for the sofa and chairs and this weekend we're cleaning out the car! We almost bought a Dyson but I'm glad we saved our money.

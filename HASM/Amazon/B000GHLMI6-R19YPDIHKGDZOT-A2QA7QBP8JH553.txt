Title: terrible customer service
Content:
The coffeemaker works OK.  Included in the box was an order form for the gold coffee filter.  I ordered it, but the one they sent did not fit.  I called, and they said they understood the problem but that "Hamilton Beach and Hamilton Beach accessories are two DIFFERENT companies, so it's not our fault they sent the wrong one."  But, they said they would fix it, sending me a new filter free of charge.  
What they sent was a new BASKET, not a filter.  I called, again, and was given the "two separate companies"  line.  Yeah, so?  HB sent me the wrong thing.  She told me no, the basket is slightly different, try it, the filter will fit.  Yes, the filter fits the basket, but the coffeemaker lid doesn't close! 
So she refers me to HB accessories, where I'm told that HB messed up, and that they are two separate companies, HB accessories did not make the mistake, HB did.  
Her solution was for me to mail the filter and basket back, and then they would send me the proper filter. See, I ordered the wrong one for my coffeemaker.  NO, I only filled out the order form that was included in the coffeemaker I bought, there was no selection of models, just a list of accessories that I assumed went with the model I purchased.  I had to wait for a manager, so I could explain that that they had made the error, not me, and they needed to just send me the filter for the appliance I had bought. 
A customer should never have to deal with this "two separate companies, so it's not our fault"  thing. When the accessory order form is in the box, and has the HB name on the order form, HB IS responsible for filling the order correctly.  Passing the blame to another division is not for the customer to hear.

Title: Great concept, good coffee
Content:
I knew I wanted my next coffee maker to have a thermal carafe -- for energy efficiency, better taste, and no more worries about turning the machine off. This machine shines in all those ways, and I am surprised how liberated I feel not having to worry about having turned off the coffee maker (somehow this concern would always arise mid-commute). This machine turns off as soon as the brew cycle stops; the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot so no heating plate is needed. 
My only complaints, which are noted by other reviewers, concern the design of the carafe. It is difficult to completely empty. As a result, the carafe cannot be used to fill the water tank, as getting the last bit of water out will cause some spillage. I use a small pitcher instead. And yes, the carafe pours slowly. I assume that this, and the difficulty emptying, are by-products of a design that effectively keeps the heat in without needing to open of loosen the lid to pour.  Although they produce a bit of a hassle, for me these problems don't negate the benefits of the thermal carafe. The coffee stays warm, even when the carafe is only partially filled, allowing me to drink it leisurely through the morning with consistent flavor from first cup to last (3 hours).
The machine is a bit bigger than my old bare-bones coffee maker, but fits easily under the upper cabinets. I do have to slide it out to open the lid and use, but I did that with my smaller model as well.  
I would absolutely buy this again.

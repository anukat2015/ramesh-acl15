Title: Simply superb space heater
Content:
I use this to keep my office warm.  It keeps the entire space a nice even temperature.  I also use it to circulate air when it is a bit warm.
Keep in mind that this heater is not a radiant heater.  It produces instant heat, but only directly in front of it.
Because this is a space heater that is designed to heat the entire space, it takes time to heat up a cold room, just like an air conditioner takes time to cool an entire room.  There is no 120 Volt - 15 amp heater that will heat an entire large, cold room in seconds.  If you expect this to, you will be dissapointed, but if you expect it to heat the entire room to an even temperature, in the time that physics will allow it to, then you will be satisfied.
If you want instant heat, then you need to look at a radiant heater, which will provide instant heat to things or people in the room, but will not circulate and heat the air in a room like this one will.
Edit;
I've been using this heater for a year now.  I like it so much, I just bought another one to heat my grandmother's room.  She likes it warmer than the rest of us.

Title: This Heater Works
Content:
As a certified electrical inspector, I here's an observation on feedback given by a previous review.  They cited a problem at the electrical outlet.  As described, this is not a problem with the heater.  It appears to be an improper electrical connection at the wall outlet.  Current building codes (2008 National Electrical Code) in place throughout much of the US require state of the art circuit breakers (Ground Fault or Arc Fault) that most likely would have prevented the overheating at the electrical outlet (not the heater) problem they described.  
  In our experience this heater works great.  We bought it for a fairly large basement bedroom which otherwise has marginal heat.  Our daughter loves the automatic control and the quiet warmth.

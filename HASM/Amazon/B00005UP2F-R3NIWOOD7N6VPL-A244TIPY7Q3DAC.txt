Title: Dirt Devil you ROCK!
Content:
What a great vaccuum!  I had recently sold my cumbersome and dirty Rainbow unit and was thrilled to come across this lightweight, easy to handle machine.  I have a few small complaints about the design, but nothing that detracts from the performance.  Mainly, it's hard to find a good place to actually hang onto this thing while vaccuuming.  There isn't a well-defined handgrip area, so my hands fumble around a bit.  It's also kind of a nuisance to have to remove the beater bar unit, power cord and all, just to use the bare floor attachment, but that doesn't take much time and really how else could that work? I had also hoped it would be even lighter still than it is - my Mom has the Vision Breeze and I vaccuum her house with it on the shoudler strap.  But no matter!  That incredible retracting cord is sooooo long I can get my entire house clean without switching outlets!  I do have to literally scrape the filter clean - I have long hair and it gets balled and matted up in the filter after a few uses.  But overall, what a great machine.  Well worth the money.

Title: I am in love with this camera
Content:
Is it sick to be so besotted with a piece of machinery? I am totally loving owning this camera. The battery life is amazing, the photo quality is crisp and while the auto function is great for an Digital SLR beginner, the manual functions are challenging enough to keep things interesting. I decided on the 28-80mm lens which for my purposes - strictly family and friends photography - is totally sufficient. The software is easy to install and use - check out the 'muvee' function for a great way to liven up looking at a million photos of your kids - a great way to keep grandparents happy while not boring them to death with a standard old slideshow. If it could make coffee in the mornings, I'd marry it.

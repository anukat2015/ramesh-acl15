Title: Deafening
Content:
Everything about this heater sounds great: 24 hour timer, digital display, remote etc... But there is one drawback I should have noticed that was omitted from the desciption -- The Noise.  This tiny heater is about as loud as a personal hair dryer.
A shame it's this loud because it cancels out every other redeeming factor.  I returned mine for a refund.  2 stars.

Title: The Melitta One:One makes no Senseo (groan)
Content:
I bought this machine wanting to compare it to my Senseo.  There are more pod options for this machine than for the Senseo, so I decided to give it a try.  Well, let me say the Melitta One:One just doesn't compare.  I was expecting the same European style coffee with crema on top - the kind the Senseo delivers.  Not only was I disappointed by the complete lack of crema, but the coffee was much cooler than coffee that's delivered from the Senseo.  This coffee machine delivers typical American style coffee.  There are two options, a 5oz. cup and an 8oz. cup, but the 8oz cup is like watered-down diner coffee.  The 5oz. cup is a little more acceptable, but the coffee quality is horrendous.  I'm used to Peets, Seattle's Best, Batdorf & Bronson, etc. type coffee and this is no comparison.  To me, the quality of the coffee pods produces something like a higher end grocery store type of coffee (not even as good as Millstone).  I do like the overall design of the Melitta better, but trust me... if European style coffee (with crema) is what you want, stay away from this machine.  Do yourself a favor and buy the Senseo.  Do a search online for alternate pods for that machine - there are plenty that are being sold overseas, but for some reason the companies haven't brought them here yet (why do companies always give us inferior products?  Chocolate made by Nestle is the same way).  Anyhow, podhead.com is also planning to come out with superior pods for the Senseo in the near future and senseopods.com has them currently.

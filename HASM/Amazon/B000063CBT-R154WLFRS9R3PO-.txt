Title: Works well for us.
Content:
We just got one of these to replace a Braun that we had for many years, also to replace a Salton Espresso machine that had broken. First of all, they must have corrected the carafe problem; we have no spilling problems at all. In fact, this one pours a lot better than the Braun did. My wife works for a coffee company and brings home all sorts of coffee blends. We tend to grind our beans at brew time. This coffee maker definitely makes better coffee than our old one did. Could be because the other one was old, but I think it because of temperature and speed. This on takes a little longer to brew a pot full because of the &quot;pulse&quot; action, but the resulting coffee is more flavorful and less bitter. The espresso could be hotter and it does seem to be a little weaker than with our old maker; just use a little more coffee than usual. We do like the little attachment that allows you to brew directly into two cups. Overall, we are satisfied that it was a good buy.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
I have owned the Antares with the power nozzle for two year, and I am looking for a new canister vacuum.  So I went to Amazon to read some reviews and boy was I surprised of the praise for the Antares. I was not sure they were talking about the same machine.  I have been back to the dealer twice. The first time because the power nozzle would  no longer attach to the wand. After 15 minutes of frustration I resorted to my 20 year old Electrox so I could finish cleaning.  The Antares  does not work on carpet.  Our house is bare floors, orientals and berber area carpets.  It takes at least four to five swipes to get lint and/or pieces of leave or anything light tracked in from outside, forget cat hair. My old Electrolux that now tends to overheat does a better job in one pass. Since I hate to clean the faster I can get it over with the better so I am still looking. 
 Electrox is now way too much money and and from the research I have read, they are not like they use to be.

Title: Perfect camera
Content:
I couldn't be happier with this camera.  I also have a digital Rebel (first generation) which has a lot of miles on it, but this camera outperforms it.  Maybe because I've used a lot of Canon digitals, I'm used to the controls and menus, but I do find them pretty simple and easy.  I like the iso/burst mode and other controls handy on the backadn also the larger screen is a nice.  I also looked at the Nikon D40, but thought the 10mp vs 6mp could be handy at times (MP is not everything, but with a large enough card, it can't hurt either).  Buy a big memory card because you'll want to shoot a lot!  Quality is first rate and Canons other lenses work perfectly with it.

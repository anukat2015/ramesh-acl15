Title: Great heater.  Short life.
Content:
I ordered 4 of these and absolutely loved them.  Silent, but they kick-out lots of heat.  If I had reviewed this 1- months ago, I would have given it 5 stars.
There is a down side however, and it's a big one.  One year after buying these two have already died and one is showing signs that it has less than a week to live.  A 75% failure rate in 12 months!?  It's too bad.
I have been a DeLonghi fan for years and this has been a huge disappointment.

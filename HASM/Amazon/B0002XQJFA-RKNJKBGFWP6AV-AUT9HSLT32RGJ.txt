Title: Simply the best affordable digital SLR camera
Content:
I upgraded from a digital rebel to the 20D. I am an aviation photographer and need the speed that this camera provides with a 5fps shutter and 26 image buffer (large jpg). I was very satisfied with the battery life of my digital rebel, but the 20D does even better with up to 700 images per charge with the BP-511A battery. For a backup, I can still use the BP-511s from my rebel.
I have not experienced any lockups or Err99 messages, just outstsanding photographs using Canon L lenses. The camera also works well with my Canon 550EX flash. I'm the type of guy who only reads a manual as a last resort. I haven't needed it with the 20D. Eveything is intuitive and easy to find.
If you are looking for a professional grade camera that will produce photographs that you can be proud of, buy the 20D.

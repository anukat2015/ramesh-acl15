Title: Very good but not incredible
Content:
This is my first MP3 player, and it fulfills my needs pretty well. A few issues: the "shake to shuffle" feature is just a terrible idea if you're going to be wearing this item during a vigorous workout. It was constantly shuffling in the middle of the song. On the plus side, turning this feature off was pretty easy. If you are primarily using this for music and not for video, the great video screen is probably overkill. The touch-sensitive wheel is not that easy to use; I'm constantly overshooting my menu selection and over- or underadjusting the volume. I'd been very impressed with the control wheels on older, full-sized iPods that I had tried, and this one doesn't measure up in terms of usability. Other than that, so far, so good.

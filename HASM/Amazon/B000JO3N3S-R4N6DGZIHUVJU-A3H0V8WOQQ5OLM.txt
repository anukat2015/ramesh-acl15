Title: Great Product!!
Content:
This has been a very good purchase. Small, really easy to use, great sound, etc. The only flaw i found is in the control wheel. Sometimes it's too sensitive and it will advance 2 positions instead of just one. Doesn't happen often, but i've picked it up. Nonetheless, it is an amazing product.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
I ordered the Acer AOA110-1722 computer on September 27, 2008. As of today, October 21, 2008, almost a month after, I have not receive it. I keep calling Amazon for quick updates but I am getting the same answer "we do not know by when we can send you the computer". The shipping date is like a moving target. I have had at least 4 and keeps changing. The last one I got is by October 23, 2008. We will see what is the new excuse to postpone it one more time.

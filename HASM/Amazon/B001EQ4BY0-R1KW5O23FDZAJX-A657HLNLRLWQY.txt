Title: Great Camera for "Prosumer"
Content:
To be fair, all these digital SLRs are just unbelievable achievements, but they get compared to each other, so small things can seem bigger.  This is an amazing camera, and so are most of the others.
Compared to the 500D, this one:
- costs more
- is sturdier (and heavier)
- has NO video mode
- has the same processor at its heart
- has a better user interface
I have found the auto-exposure is imperfect, but that's not so unusual -- I just often prefer tweaking photos slightly from the recommended exposure using the manual setting.
I am frustrated that the "bulb" setting expects you to hold the shutter button down for the entire exposure (by definition, bulb photos are long photos, and holding a camera steady while holding the button down is a challenge -- not to mention a pain.  Who wants to do that for even a minute, let alone super-long exposures?  But I am told this is industry standard.
This DOES work with my 15-year-old Canon EF lenses.
The Live View feature is surprisingly limited, but often nice to have available.  Certain features don't work when using Live View.

Title: Makes weak coffee
Content:
I bought a replacement for this after about a month of use because the coffee is disappointingly weak and lacking in flavor - the water doesn't seem hot enough. I got tired of using twice the normal amount of coffee to get my two cups of joe in the morning - and no matter what, it made good Sumatra taste like Folger. Quite disappointed; I've had good luck with other non-thermal carafe Mr Coffee machines in the past (and in fact, that's what I just replaced this one with.)
Also the lid is a bit of a pain to get used to - what's wrong with traditional screw-on lids? Those work very well. And finally, the spout is poorly designed and it's really hard not to drip coffee all over the counter when pouring.
I could have lived with the last two flaws, but couldn't take the weak, nasty-tasting coffee. I would not recommend this if taste is a priority. It did keep the coffee reasonably hot for an hour or so, but you have to "pre-warm" the pot with hot water to keep it hot for longer.

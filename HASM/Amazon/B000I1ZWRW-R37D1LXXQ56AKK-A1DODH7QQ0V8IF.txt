Title: Great Upgrade from Point & Shoot
Content:
Bought the Canon Digital Rebel xti in May, and it is my first digital SLR. The controls are not as intuitive as a point & shoot, and there is an overload of buttons, settings, etc. Now for the good news.
The picture quality is fantastic, especially in more demanding settings (low lighting, quick movement, etc). The Canon has a very good speed, and you can capture close to 2 frames per second. I also looked at the Sony alpha, but after reading several online reviews by owners, the Canon is a superior ownership proposition, and great VFM. Enjoy!

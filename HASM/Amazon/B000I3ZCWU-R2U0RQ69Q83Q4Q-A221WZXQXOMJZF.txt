Title: excellent product
Content:
This camera works great. I mainly use it in a studio where it sits on a tripod. The only thing I find wrong with it is that I can't view my model in the large LCD display. I have to look through the small viewfinder which is kind of awkward. Overall, though, very happy with this camera.

Title: Perfect for dorm
Content:
There are two dials and they are difficult to read but it is not as complicated as people are making it seem:  
The LEFT DIAL has three settings: "o" (means NO heat), "1" (means heat level 1), and "2" (means heat level 2).  
The RIGHT DIAL is the "thermostat" and it ranges from "o" (off) to "6" (allows the room to get hot).  
I only use heat level 1 and just turn the "thermostat" to 6 and my heater NEVER cuts off when doing this.  If you treat the "thermostat" (right dial) like an on/off switch it works great; either have it off or on 6.  The numbers in between are well intended but not really practical.  
I don't know what people are expecting out of a 15 dollar heater; I wanted it to heat my room and it does great, when it gets too hot I turn the heat off and leave the fan on, simple.
I bought this for my dorm room and it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  My room is about 170 square feet and this little heater warms up the whole room in less than 15 minutes on the "stage 1" heat level.  On "stage 2" level the room gets hot in about 3 minutes but then the thermal cut off kicks in b/c the heater gets too hot, so I never use "stage 2".  Once the room gets warm I just flip the heat off and use it as a fan to keep air circulating and it works great.

Title: Already malfunctioning after two months of use
Content:
Bought this heater in October, and already malfunctioning. Good while it worked, kept things warm like it should. Suddenly would start shutting down after ten or so minutes, unplugging or turning the unit off and back on did nothing. If it costs $80 some dollars I would expect to at least get a couple years out of it at a minimum. Returning for a partial refund.

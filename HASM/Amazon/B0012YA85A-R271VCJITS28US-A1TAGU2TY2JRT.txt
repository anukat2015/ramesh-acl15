Title: Great value for the money
Content:
I've used Canon products for years...high end, usually. I decided to try this camera when I got the bug to buy a new one but didn't want to spend a lot. Consumer reviews were high, and with good reason. I have gotten some of the best photos ever with this camera, especially with a nice lens. The lens that comes with this package is decent, but I'd go with the bigger Canon EF 28-200mm lens. I finally did, and yep. All the reviews were right.

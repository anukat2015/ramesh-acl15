Title: Shipped a different model
Content:
This one-star rating is not against the product, but is posted because I was sent a totally different model and specs.  The model listed on the box I received was a Q860 and not a Q830.  There is nothing I could find on the Q860 online, so it must be a new model introduced by Toshiba.  However, this version comes with an i5 (not i7) processor and no blu-ray.  The hard drive is larger too, but that is a plus.  If these differences do not bother you then I am sure you will be happy with your purchase.  As always, Amazon provided great customer service and is providing me a full refund that includes shipping costs.

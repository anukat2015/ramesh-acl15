Title: Most Used Appliance
Content:
I love this little appliance!!!  Definitely has more than paid for itself over the past year or so.  In fact, it's really crazy how many times I use it -- sometimes several times during a day!  Just so easy to use and has great suction!  If it ever does go kaput, I will be lost until I get a replacement.  The replacement will be another Shark NOT a Dustbuster, which we had before.  The suction is so much better on this.
I hate housework and have found a way to keep things looking nice without dragging the vacuum out everday.  I keep my Shark charging all the time with the long extension on it (I use that one the most).  Every morning, I go grab my little Shark and take a quick walk around the house.  First stop is the kitchen floor.  I must be a messy cook because each morning I do a quick sweep with a broom and then use my little Shark to scoop up the little pile.  No dust pan needed!  Then I walk quickly from room to room, looking for lint on the rugs or carpet, crumbs, just anything I see that needs to be picked up.  That's it--just a few minutes of touch up and my house is ready for whoever might stop by.  
It is particularly useful for a couple of problem areas:  I have glass inserts on my coffee table and dust/crumbs seem to get caught there--this makes it so easy to keep clean (again without having to put the hose on the big vacuum)or lifting out the inserts to clean around them.   The other is my bathroom and kitchen rugs.  They are a dark color and show every single speck on them.  I used to use a lint roller every day--this is so much easier and cheaper!

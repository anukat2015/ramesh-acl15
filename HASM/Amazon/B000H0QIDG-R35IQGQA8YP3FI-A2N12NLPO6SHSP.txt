Title: Apple ipod Shuffle
Content:
You had to rate at least one star--I wouldn't rate Blue Proton that high. I bought the Apple Ipod Shuffle from Blueproton through Amazon.   I understood there was a 15% restocking fee if I didn't keep it.   When I received it, it didn't work and I have written to Amazon twice as well as directly to Blueproton twice on how to return it.   Blueproton never answered so I considered their customer service to be extremely poor and no longer wanted to do business with them. I returned it via returned receipt and contested my charge on the credit card.  Blue Proton returned the package.  I wouldn't recommend buying anything from Blue Proton through Amazon.  This has taught me only to buy directly from Amazon not secondary stores.  The contested charge will stand now.

Title: Comfort Zone CZ530 Deluxe Radiant Heater
Content:
Don't waste your time or money on this sorry excuse of a heater. This heater is just another Chinese made piece of crap!!! I bought mine from a local industrial supply house and took it home to try it out. It didn't work, so I took it back and got another. Before leaving the store, I made the clerk plug it in to the wall outlet to see that it worked. Everything seemed okay, so I took it home. Well, after two to three months of use it no longer works. The fan runs but the heating elements are completely out.I gently wiggled the heater and sparks came out were the heating elements exit into the right side of the interior of the case. These heaters are like most Chinese made products. They are junk when they leave the factory!! Even with a one year warranty, it is just not worth the aggravation.

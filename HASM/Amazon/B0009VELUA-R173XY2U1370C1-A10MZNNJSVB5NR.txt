Title: Don't waste your money!
Content:
PLEASE don't waste your money on this!  We bought it on looks and brand name, but after a few months, the timer light went out.  We thought about calling, but still loved the coffee, so we just dealt with it.  After a year, it just QUIT!  Repeated calls to the manufacturer have us still waiting after TWO months!  They even had the nerve to charge us $10 shipping....and never sent the coffee maker!  It appears we are on some HUGE waiting list.  They did offer to 'exchange us' to a carafe type coffee maker, but after looking at those, I noticed they were cheaper and also not what we wanted!
DON'T buy this!!!

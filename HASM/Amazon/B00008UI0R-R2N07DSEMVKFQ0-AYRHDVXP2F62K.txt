Title: Poor design; multiple failures in first 12 months.
Content:
In the first month, the yellow collar holding the filter broke. The unit works without it, however. The contraptions holding the powerbar to the wand allows hair and debris to become trapped, causing the powerbar to slip off until you wrench the spring back and clean out the debris. Objects become lodged in the bend of the handle and cannot be reached with standard household implements (I used a 14" surgical tool). The slide switch failed twice and now the vacuum appears dead altogether. I give up. I won't even mention how much I disliked cleaning the dirt trap and drying filter, only to have it mildew in the Florida humidity, because that was a given, I suppose. No more Hoovers for me.

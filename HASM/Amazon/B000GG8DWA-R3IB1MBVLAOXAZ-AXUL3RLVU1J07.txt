Title: warm only right in front of unit
Content:
I bought this unit to warm up our bathroom especially after showering. Overall we like it since it is very quiet and others have said it is relatively energy efficient. However it does not really warm the whole room in a reasonable amount of time but it is very warm right in front of the unit which is nice when comming out of the shower. I think it does warm up the whole room but just not quite enough and our bathroom is not huge by any means.

Title: Great Laptop with great price
Content:
I received this laptop a few days ago, it was packed well and arrived safely. The set up was easy, it took maybe two hours to create three recovery discs. Well, no one like to spend time on it but you have to, and almost every computer need you to burn your own recovery discs now days.
Screen was bright and clear, HD indeed. Processor is super fast, plus higher front bus speed and 4GB DDR3 RAM. The 500GB HD is one of the biggest all laptops featured. It runs cool, and not much junk softwear as other laptop.
I have compared all different brand, and narrow down to Asus and Acer (my wife has a Asus with T6600 processor, it runs fast and cool), Asus has two years warrantee, Acer only one year, but Acer has a faster processor and more solid key board. It's the best deal on the market now.

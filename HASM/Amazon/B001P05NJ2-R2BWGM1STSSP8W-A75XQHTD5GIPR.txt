Title: A quality product -- I'm hooked
Content:
Having used windows for almost exclusively, I was reluctant to switch to a Mac. But I needed a new laptop after my Sony Think Pad died of old age, so I took the plunge. I'm very happy I did. 
Aside from everything you've heard about the Mac operating system, the thing that really impressed me was the quality. It is the best built laptop I've ever held. The aluminum body is light but strong. The slide-in DVD loader is superior to the flimsy trays on most lap tops. Despite the occasional glare, the screen is sharp and clear. I prefer the gloss as it makes pictures and videos "pop" off the screen. The keyboard is comfortable and has a great feel. Even if it were a windows-based unit, I would be impressed by the quality workmanship of the product. 
The graphics accelerator is also impressive. Call of Duty 4 runs smooth with fast frame rates. I set the game to its optimum graphic settings and it runs much better than my current desktop setup (which uses a top-end nvidia accelerator from three years ago).  This laptop has some muscle.

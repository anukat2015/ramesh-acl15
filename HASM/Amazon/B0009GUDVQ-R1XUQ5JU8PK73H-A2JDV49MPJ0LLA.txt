Title: Sony MP3 Player (NW-HD5)
Content:
After resisting the Apple iPod for months I finally got tired of toting a laptop along just to play music on flights while travelling and following a favorable review of the new Sony NW-HD5, I took the plunge and got one.  To be brief....it is a great device. I have found that even the in-the-ear headphones that come with it are more than adequate and have stopped lugging Bose noise cancelling headphones around as well. The Sony was easy to set up and the battery life really is one of its strong selling points as it easily lasts for long international flights with time to spare. Navigation among playlists or songs by genre or artist is a snap. The controls are large enough that they do not accidentally get pushed yet the entire device fits into a shirt pocket with room to spare. I think anyone who wants an MP3 player and who does not want to follow the herd with Apple will like this Sony product.

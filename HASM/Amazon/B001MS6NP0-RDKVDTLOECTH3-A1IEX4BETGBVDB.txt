Title: Stylish, good PC, NOT a Mac.
Content:
This PC gets the job done without even looking like a PC yet make not mistake, you still have to put up with the endless list of updates every other time you log in, download a bunch of drivers when you do upgrade to the new operating system, find your way out of compatibility issues especially 64bit-related and so on and so forth. So if you want a mac killer just get a better mac. If you just want a "nice" (that what people call mine) -decent (and not really impressive) PC for your buck: this is a great choice.

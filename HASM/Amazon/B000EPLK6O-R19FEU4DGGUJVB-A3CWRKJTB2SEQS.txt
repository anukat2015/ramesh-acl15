Title: Filter Ineffective - Advice Provided
Content:
I was willing to pay the extra (rather exorbitant) price to get the filtered water for taste (filtering DOES take away bitterness if your water is office-type water). I tested it with and without the filter and could not tell a difference. So, why keep this when you can get the same results for $20? Additionally, all of the parts involved are cumbersome for an office environment. It was returned.
The coffee is hot enough (I wouldn't want it any hotter). Three stars for average coffee, but poor value.
Tip to get filtered water: buy the PUR CR-6000 2 Stage Oval Water Pitcher for $16 from Amazon and get REALLY well filtered water for your $20 coffee maker. Again, filtering the water helps quite a bit with the bitterness.

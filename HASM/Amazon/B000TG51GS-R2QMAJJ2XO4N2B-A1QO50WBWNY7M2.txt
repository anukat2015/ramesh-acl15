Title: Nice heater - great value
Content:
I bought this heater during the Friday deal. For that price this heater is great value and a real bargain. It seems well made and has decent features. I have used it both in the tower and horizontal configuration and it provides heat quickly - feels real nice when you enter a freezing room. I am ordering a second one since we were taking it all over the house. The controls are easy to use once you get used to it. I had to refer to the manual a couple of times to understand what the various symbols on the dial meant - but it was no big deal.

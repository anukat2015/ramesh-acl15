Title: Two tries, two problems
Content:
I bought this machine because of its Best Buy rating in Consumer Reports.  All I can figure is that CR got some sort of perfect specimen.  The first machine I received had a problem with the clock -- it would keep minutes fine, but the hours went all over the place.  I set it up in the evening, reset it in the morning (after it didn't start brewing at the time I had programmed), and it was off again by the time I got home.
Since I drink coffee every day, I figured I'd use the coffeemaker until the replacement arrived.  That came a couple days later...and the lid was broken.  Needless to say, I'm not asking for another replacement.
I'm pretty disappointed in this machine because the coffee brewing aspects seem to work well.  The carafe is well-designed and hasn't dripped, and the machine is easy to set up, use, and clean.  Hopefully B&D will fix the electronics and plastics problems someday.

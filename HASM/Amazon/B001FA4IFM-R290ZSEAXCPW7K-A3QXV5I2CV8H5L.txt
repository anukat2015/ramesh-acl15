Title: should be 5 but
Content:
Fantastic heater. I have 3 now. Great heat, almost no noise. Temperature setting sometimes is difficult to manage, as it's either too hot or too cold for the auto-temp function to kick in, but if you keep it on the floor rather than elevated, it helps. Still great heater. Only thing I would note is that I just received our third (we gave the second as a gift) and this new one has a slight rattle. Still even with the rattle it is quieter than most, but as soon as I took this new one out of the box and turned it on, we found this slight defect which was disappointing (though not as bad as having a Toyota Camry). I am going to see if they will send me a replacement.

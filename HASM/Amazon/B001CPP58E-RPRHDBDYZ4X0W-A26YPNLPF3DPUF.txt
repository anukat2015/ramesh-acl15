Title: DeLonghi DCH4590ER Heater
Content:
We have a travel trailer and a pickup camper.  This is the 4th heater we have purchased from this company, and they are wonderful.  They preform circles above other heaters.  This last one is nice because it has the remote control.  The temperater control is just a little off, it reads about 5 degrees less than the room accually is, but that is no big problem.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs a little boost in room temerature.  We like it so much, we ordered another one to have as a spare.  The price was certainly great.

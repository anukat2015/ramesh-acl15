Title: Hoover Windtunnel Really Sucks!
Content:
It's the best vacuum I've ever used.  Not so great for small area rugs, but I love it.  Even more-so than the very expensive Meila I used to have.  Emptying the garbage out of the bagless cup can be a little messy, but the cleaning ability is fabulous!

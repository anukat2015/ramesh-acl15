Title: love the touch
Content:
i have a 1st gen and a 2nd gen, they both rock, the 2nd gen is faster and has the ability to raise and lower volume by a outside button. only flaws seem to be youtube videos sometimes freeze, and web pages seem to get "stuck" every now and again. turning the unit completely off "hold down the power button untill the red off slider appears" and restarting it clears up the glitches. i love my ipods.

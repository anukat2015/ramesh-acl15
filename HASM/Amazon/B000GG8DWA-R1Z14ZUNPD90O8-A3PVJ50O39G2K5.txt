Title: cheap, quiet
Content:
This is a good deal. Mine has worked fine for the 8 months or so I have had it. I like quartz heaters for when I am working in one place, like at the computer. They don't heat the room air very well--they only heat what they are pointed at. This one has 2 heat settings, and the low setting is 400 watts, which is lower than other brands. I keep it 3 feet away and it keeps me warm for 4-5 cents an hour. There is no fan--something almost all the others have. I like this. The unit works silently.
Two things to consider: The safety switch on the bottom is a push button that turns off the heater if it falls over. It only needs to be extended very slightly, however, to break the circuit. This means that if it is on an uneven surface the heater may not come on. I wrapped a little tape on mine to make the plunger a bit longer so it would sit on an uneven stool. Make sure if you do this you do not defeat the switch. It is there for a reason.
Also, the control wheel on the side cannot be read from in front of the heater (Design team!). I used a magic marker on the edge of the wheel: dash, double dash, and zero--for low, high and off.
OK, I am a bit anal....

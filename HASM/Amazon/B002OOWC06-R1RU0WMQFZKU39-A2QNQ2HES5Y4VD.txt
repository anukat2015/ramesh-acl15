Title: sweet laptop
Content:
Had this for a week now and love it. Fast,light,good battery life. I didn't realize how slow my old laptop was.The n wireless card working fine and fast with a dlink 655 router.Did the recommened updates on the toshiba bulletin board.Sound is fine considering the size of the laptop. Also bought the toshiba dvd burner and made rescue disks with no problem. i was nervous to buy this I always had a dell.Go for it!

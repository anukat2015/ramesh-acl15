Title: Why I bought this from Amazon...
Content:
I haven't had time to play around enough with this comp to review it, but I will at a later date. 
Like some have mentioned, this product is available at some other retailers for a lower price. However, if you use the Payphrase promo going on right now, you receive 5% cashback within the month to use towards future Amazon purchases. Then, I just got an unexpected email giving me a $20 credit for Amazon Videos on Demand. And, you can get a free year subscription to Wired, if you so desire. So, with just the 5% cashback alone, I'm looking at pretty much the same amount I'd pay at the big blue store with their 7.5% local tax added. As an added bonus, I don't have to deal with them trying to peddle all their additional geek squad services and extended warranties, and Amazon brings it straight to my door. Easy decision. I heart Amazon.

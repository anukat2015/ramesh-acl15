Title: Serious Equipment for Serious Photography
Content:
This is not my first camera, but it is my first Digital SLR and it provides everything any of the previous offered or lacked. It is only worth the money if you are serious enough to explore all its features and learn how to use them quickly when you need them. It has re-ignited my interest in photography and gives me the tools to correctly expose difficult scenes.
There are options to cover all situations. In the past I know I should have bracketed exposures, but did not spend the time. NO excuse with this camera. Previous cameras were limited to 24, 36, or 100 exposures per media, but here a 8gb card will allow for 520 RAW(NEF) exposures or thousands of JPEGs your choice.
Excellent operation, exterior finish, and produces exceptional photos. I have coupled it with the NIKON AFS 18mm-200mm lens. It is still lighter and more compact then my previous SLR's with smaller zoom lenses.

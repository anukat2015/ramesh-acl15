Title: Can I Get An Answer?
Content:
Sunbeam SFH436-UM Bath Fan Heater with Digital Timer
This review is not a praise review so it may not get published. I did not think the instructions easy to follow.  It took a while for me to learn how to set the time, and because I can not get a straight answer from Sunbeam, I unplug the heater each time I leave home.  When I plug it in the socket again, I have to use the time set mode to stop it from blinking.  Why do I unplug it?  Because the safety instructions advise you to, "Always unplug the heater when not in use."  
It has a wonderful device that will shut off the electric current leading to the heater if danger of electricution could occur, but in spite of the fact that the heater has a digital timer so you can time it to turn on when you are not present, I am following the safety instructions until I find an answer. Think of it, what is the purpose of having the timer if it needs to be unplugged when not in use?  I believe someone overlooked this sentence when they printed owner's guide.
I have been trying to get an answer from a Sunbeam technician that knows the mechanics of this heater, but I have only been able to communicate with customer representatives, and they don't have the information I need.
I do like the heater.  It heats up quickly, and when I find an answer to this question, I think I will appreciate it even more. 
UPDATE:  I received my first electric bill since using this heater.  It consumes a lot of electricity.  Although it heats quickly, I will be using it only as necessary.

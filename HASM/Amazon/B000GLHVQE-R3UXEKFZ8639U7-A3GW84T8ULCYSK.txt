Title: great little heater and and very attractive
Content:
I bought this heater to warm up my home office which is located in the basement and I have been very pleased with it.  I wanted something more attractive than the typical space heater that would still do the job.  I am very pleased with this product.  On low setting it warms the room nicely.  It is obviously not a real fireplace, of course.  I like that the glow from the fire allows me to tell by looking if it is on which helps me remember to turn it off at the end of the work day.  It makes a very low quiet humming sound when on.

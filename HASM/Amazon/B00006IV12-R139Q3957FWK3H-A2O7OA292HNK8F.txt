Title: Annoying control button
Content:
Length:: 1:41 MinsI bought this heater because of all the positive reviews on Amazon. It's small, inexpensive and heats up a room fairly well. However, I don't like this heater because you have to keep pressing the "one-touch" button over and over again to change the temperature settings or turn off the unit.

Title: Rebel xti
Content:
I have had a progression of Canon cameras beginning with the SLR Rebel 2000. When I moved into digital SLR it only made sense to go with a name I could trust--not to mention I  could use the lenses I already had! Over three years ago I purchased the 6.1 mp Canon Rebel. Almost two years later I handed that one down to my amateur photographer daughter and bought the 8.1 mp Canon XT. A month ago I gave the XT to my daughter, who passed the Rebel along to my son--and bought the 10.1 Rebel XTi for myself! Now there are three very happy members of my family. These cameras are everything the consumer and expert reviews promise--ease of use if I want to go auto, the ability to capture some great pictures by playing with some of the manual features and nothing but praise from everyone for the results. My whole family highly recommends the Canon Rebel for any photographer who loves great pictures.

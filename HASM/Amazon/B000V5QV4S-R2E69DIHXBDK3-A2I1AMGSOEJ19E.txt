Title: Just what the photographer ordered at a better price
Content:
Great camera!  Perfect the advanced amateur and the beginning professional. A great camera to grow with as well.  the camera is managed by buttons on the back rather than an involved menu.  Hence it is easier to learn and easier to make adjustments while shooting.  I upgraded from the 20D and it was worth the price of admission. With the introduction of the 50D, prices on this model came down.  the bigger LCD is great and so it the option to magnify an image before moving on.
I would highly recommend this camera.Canon EOS 20D 8.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)

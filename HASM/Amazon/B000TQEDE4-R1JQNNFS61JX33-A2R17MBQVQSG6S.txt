Title: cuisinart coffee machine
Content:
I have had this machine about a month now and am very pleased with it. The stainless thermal pot keeps the coffee pretty hot for about 2 hours. Freshly brewed coffee will burn your mouth if not careful. My husband gets up an goes hunting at 5:00am and when I get up at 7:00 the coffee is still hot. Great price and good value.

Title: Lengthy Review - Would Rate 3.5 Stars If I could

The bad
- Track pad is truly horrible, there are two different drivers for the unit, and results vary. The track pad will loose where my finger is even if I stay within the dimpled area. This could be due to a scroll section built in but it's annoying. Using the track pad regularly eventually results in highlighted text, unintended of course. Track pad placement is not centered on the keyboard layout; it's centered on the chassis. When resting my palms to type the right thumb will hit the track pad making the cursor do unpredictable things. 
I spent two hours trying to 'get used' to this broken horrible hardware implementation. Eventually I was wondering if my hand eye coordination was to blame so I ended up doing my own `controlled' experiments and still witnessed the cursor do odd things. I couldn't take it any longer and plugged in a Logitech Bluetooth mouse. To my dismay, unlike my 2.5-year-old Asus M50 laptop this one didn't shut off the track pad automatically when a mouse was plugged in. I had to find that setting and change it myself by going into Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > ELAN (tab) and check the box "Disable when external USB mouse plug in". Now the track pad will disable when another pointer is detected. 
Asus user forums suggest that this is a driver issue and the track pad can be fixed with this work around: Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Device Manager > Mice and Other Pointing Devices right click and select Properties then press the button > Update Driver > Browse my computer for driver software > Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer > Select "Standard PS/2 Port Mouse" from the list and click Next. The track pad worked much better, but the placement of the pad isn't optimal and I still hit it with my right thumb causing loss of cursor placement when typing fast. 
ELAN hardware driver is a major failure in my opinion. The work around is to use a generic device driver until they get their act together. Also the physical location of the track pad is a failure on the design team. Removing one point for this bad implementation.
- The Nvidia G210M is no longer supported. I purchased a new laptop with a graphics chip that's not only obsolete, but retired. Drivers from Nvidia's site will NOT work to update this chip. Drivers from Asus own web site are out of date when compared with the latest WHQL driver release for the G210M chip. There is no fix for this issue. Asus will have to work to release specialized functional drivers, the likelihood of that is low. Removing half a point for this issue.
The Good:
- Served the purpose I purchased this device for. I wanted to build an HTPC (Home Theater PC), but it was going to cost just as much as this laptop for one self-built `set-top' device. Instead of needing a device at every TV now I have this slick laptop I can plug in via HDMI to any of my HDTVs. I run SnapStream BeyondTV Link to connect to my BeyondTV server in my house. I plug in an HDMI cable from my UL30VT to any of my flat screen TVs and it's like having a mobile TIVO unit. High definition video even works wirelessly, something that is mostly due to SnapStream's software, but also due to the robust processing power of this mighty little laptop.
- SILENCE! This laptop is quieter than any HTPC I've ever heard, built, or read about and it's the quietest laptop with discrete graphics I've ever used. Even water-cooled PCs are going to be louder than the UL30Vt. The only way I can imagine a more silent unit would require 100% passively cooled system with a solid state hard drive.
- Lightweight and compact. There was some internet chatter about the top cover being specially treated plastic; as far as I can tell it is not plastic. The cover is metal, likely aluminum but I'm not testing the alloy to find out the molecular composition. The cover looks slick and professional. It sucks up fingerprints like crazy and getting them out will require cleaner. The laptop is very light and easily held. However the screen flexes a bit too much for my tastes. There's no way to lock the lid closed. Not a huge issue for me, but might be for some. 
- The screen is nice but the color reproduction isn't very accurate. Response time is more than enough for games and video viewing. The brightness should be turned down from 100% unless you are using it in direct sunlight. Off axis viewing is horrible. Don't try and huddle around this screen with more than 2 people. The LED screen uses very little power, so that's the trade off.
- After installing the high definition sound drivers from Windows Update, under optional updates, I was able to get sound via the HDMI cable. To do this the laptop must be in video output mode to only output video via HDMI. If the laptop screen is being used at all the audio device for the laptop speakers will be used and sound will come through those instead of the HDMI-connected screen.
- Keyboard is great. I didn't think I'd like this style keyboard but the key action is plenty for a good tactile response and the layout is close enough to a standard keyboard that the only key I've flubbed is `delete'.
- Speakers are much better than expected. There's no way to get super lows out of laptop speakers, but these are very clear and not horribly tinny. This is a huge feat to do in such a small form factor. The speakers fire out the angled front underside of the hand rest area. Sound will get muffled if you have the device on a soft surface or your lap, but bounce very well off a desk or table.
- Power consumption is wonderful so far. I'll have to report back on how much high definition viewing I can get on a full battery charge at a later time. If the battery power meter is an accurate indication it would appear that I might be able to get 3 hours of viewing via HDMI from a full charge.
The Odd:
- Partition D: is senseless. Why not just one large partition? I changed that with Windows 7 Disk Management easily enough, but still kind of annoying to have one 116 GB partition and one 335 GB partition. 
- There is a 14.65 GB recovery section on the hard drive that could only be recovered if the entire drive was formatted and an operating system was loaded from scratch. The included restore disc will NOT work for that purpose it's not a full Windows 7 disc, so the user would have to buy another copy of Windows 7. If you do reclaim this ~15 GB of space the recovery feature won't work on your unit ever again.
- There's a lot of bloatware to uninstall. This is sadly normal for most pre-configured computers these days. Trend Micro was one of the first nag-ware items to be removed, stop the service from the taskbar and shut down the app from there too, then run the uninstall. Unless you want the games from Oberon Media uninstall anything from that publisher. After uninstalling all the games from Oberon, go and delete the folder that's still at C:/ Program Files (x86) / Oberon Media. There are a lot of things in the taskbar, I'll have to figure out what they're all doing and remove some of them. 
- Built in camera provides a laughable resolution. I didn't even know they made cameras at 0.3 Megapixels still. I think maybe these were repurposed from used cell phones ;)
- Battery life isn't accurate. Like many other laptop manufacturers the battery life claims are blown WAY out of proportion. Using the UL30VT to surf the web, do some email, and a bit of web code will result in about 5 hours of continuous use at the maximum. There is no way I can see how anyone would get 10 hours or more out of this device unless it's just in standby mode.
Conclusion:
The laptop serves the purpose I got it for. It is an HTPC in a multifunctional attractive shell. As a huge bonus it's so portable I can bring it to work every day. It plays some games fine enough.
The switching graphics turned out to be a double-edged sword. It allows a fantastic power savings but the implementation is so specialized that there may not be a graphics driver update available for the entire UL##Vt line. That realization was very disappointing. 
Price point is perhaps a bit high but I'm satisfied overall with the purchase. I would recommend this device to others looking for a portable yet reasonably powerful laptop.
I'd probably give this 3.5 stars if I could but I'll rate it at a 4. Just make sure you factor in a mouse with this purchase and that you're ok never being able to update your video drivers.

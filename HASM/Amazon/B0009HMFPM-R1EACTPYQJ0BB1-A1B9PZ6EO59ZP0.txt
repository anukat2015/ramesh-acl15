Title: Barely puts out heat
Content:
It delivers what is advertised, but few people (including myself) actually realize how much heat 100W is.  
It basically takes a 100W light bulb and spreads the energy across a 3x2 ft panel.  It will raise the temp under your desk a degree or two, but if you are expecting "radiant" heat, you need to look elsewhere.

Title: Olympus E500 - Great For Manual Camera Users
Content:
This camera takes amazing crisp clear pictures. Much better than my old Olympus D-540.
This is an especially wonderful camera if you're a photographer looking for a digital slr for manual use.
However, If you can afford it, I recommend buying the Canon EOS instead.

Title: Love it!
Content:
Great buy!  Like other reviewers, I'd agree that this could be improved with a swivel hose and a better release mechanism between the hose and the rug attachment, but a side from that it works better than any vacuum I've had in the past few years ~ including a much more expensive Kenmore upright.  Great suction ~ really gets the job done and I love the upholstry attachment. Plus the variable suction control works great when you want to tackle an area rug. I would definitely recommend it to any one who wants to get the job done without breaking the bank.

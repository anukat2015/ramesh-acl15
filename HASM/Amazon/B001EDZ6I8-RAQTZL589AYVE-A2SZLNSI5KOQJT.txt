Title: LOVE This Heater - Great for Under Your Desk - Great for Hot/Cold Office Issues
Content:
My boss & I are always going back & forth on office temperature settings.  Last year, he gave me a fleece blanket, but this year it was the Vornado Foot Heater/Space Heater.
The heat portion of the foot heater comes out of the middle, not the sides as you'd expect looking at the picture.  The switches are at the top (heat settings for 1 switch & on/off for the other switch).
PROS:
Great personal heater for under your desk
Warms nicely/efficiently
Bumps are nice for massaging feet
Easy to reach (with foot) on/off & heat/fan switches
Easily portable
CONS:
Out of the box, the heater smells horrible when first turned on. It took a little while for the smell to dissipate 
You can get sleepy because of the foot warmth 
Overall, I think this is a great product and am looking forward to using it for years.

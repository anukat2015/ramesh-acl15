Title: Great coffee; VERY quiet
Content:
I've had this machine now for about 2 weeks.  I purchased this one because it stated it had the "quiet brew"   The B60 apparently does as well per manufacturer website, but Amazon did not specifically mention it on the B60 page so I got the B70 to make sure (though it costs more).   I am glad I did.  This thing is super quiet - when you initially turn it on, you'll hear water boiling for a few seconds (not very loud).  When you push the brew button, all you will hear is the sounds of water dripping in your cup.  Nothing else.  
Coffee wise, I am very happy.  I like STRONG tasty coffee, not that diluted colored water stuff.   You'll find it with this machine (go for the "bold" types of coffee for strong coffee).  
The timer is very useful.  The machine turns on automatically at 6:30 so that I can have my coffee in SECONDS when I get to the kitchen (no waiting time, push the button and it's ready).   It automatically turns off a few hours later so little electricity wasted.   
Compared to Tassimo which I have had for past 3 years:  this is MUCH quieter and more variety in coffee available.  Cons: no cappuchino or expresso.   Thus I'm keeping my Tassimo which I'll use for when I feel the need for a nice cappuchino.

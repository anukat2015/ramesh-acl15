Title: Great Pot!
Content:
Well I have no vices left except my coffee--and this lets me indulge deliciously.  One thing that I would have liked is a transparent line in the coffeemaker itself with cup numbers, so I could see where I'm pouring to.  But I've learned to rely on the decanter, and what a great one it is--no spills.  I had loved my Krups for years, but couldn't stand the daily water-spills when I poured water from the pitcher into the Thang.  This one also and most importantly makes GRRRREAT coffee.  We usually make 10 measured cups of grounds with 9 cups of water to get it how we like...and we savor the flavor. Enjoy!

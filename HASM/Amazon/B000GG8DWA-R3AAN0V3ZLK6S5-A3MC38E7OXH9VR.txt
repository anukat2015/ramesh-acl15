Title: A Very Quiet Heater
Content:
I've been using two of these in two different small rooms for a year now.  Each of them is combined with a Lux Products WIN100 Programmable Thermostat.  
This heater is unusually quiet.  I am a light sleeper, and I find it almost impossible to get a good rest while using a heater that has a fan, but I have been sleeping fine while having this heater only four feet away from my bed.   
I am now buying two more of these heaters which will be used together to heat a large room (12 x 17 feet).

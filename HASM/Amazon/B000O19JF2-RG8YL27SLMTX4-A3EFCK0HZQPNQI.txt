Title: My first digital SLR
Content:
I took a while converting from film to digital.  My first two digital cameras (back around 2000) were sold within a week of purchase.  Somewhere around 2004, I bought my first point-and-shoot digital camera, and it was good enough to keep.  I have upgraded one or two times, but finally had to get an SLR.
So you're reading the advice of a hobbyist, a casual taker of pictures, not by any means a pro or even a knowledgeable amateur.  And my comment basically amounts to one thing: the picture quality just blew me away.  It's not just a question of megapixels, either: as many have pointed out, the most important actor is probably the glass (lens).
But to the original point again: the picture quality from this camera is fabulous.  After a year of using it, I am starting to get the urge to own a D300, but I am also thinking about upgrading the lenses.
Still, in my opinion, this camera doesn't need an upgrade.  I could use it happily for the next two decades.  It's great!!

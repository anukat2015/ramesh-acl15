Title: Great camera!
Content:
Purchased this camera for it's large sensor (vs. a point and shoot), portability and highly rated image quality. Thus far this camera has exceeded my expectations. I still use my Nikon DSLR, but at this point, I'm usually reaching for the GF1 as I head out the door.  If you follow the photography blogs you'll discover that many of the reviewers purchased their own cameras when they had to return their test models. This is an indication of just how great this camera really is.

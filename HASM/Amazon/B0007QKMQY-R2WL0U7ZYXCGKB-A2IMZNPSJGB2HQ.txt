Title: The Best Camera I've ever owned...
Content:
... with the constant advances in technology, however, the latest camera you buy will tend to be the best ever.  This is one great camera for the price.  i tried the Nikon D50, Olympus E500, Pentax *ist, and went for the Rebel XT.  They all had features that I liked but the Canon stood above the rest.  If you like shooting in available light, Canon is head and shoulders above the competition.  The speed of the camera is very impressive as well.  I'm not going to get into all the specs of the camera since they have already been covered.  You can't go wrong with the Rebel XT.

Title: The Best!
Content:
A great notebook! It is light and portable, and has a great design. I switched for Windows Vista(AHH) to a MacBook with Snow Leopard (awesome!).This mac has fantastic graphics, and a wonderful display, do not regret buying this! It s absolutely perfect! It is blazing fast too! I love the mac operating system! 
Dont live with PC, get a MacBook! :)

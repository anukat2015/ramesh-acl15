Title: Better than most people will tell you.
Content:
I've always been picky when it comes to computers. This is my second computer to have a Celeron processor. The first one was crap. Nothing but crap. It overheated all the time and was very slow. I decided to buy this computer after a few of my friends told me that it was better than the previous generation of Celerons. They're right. This computer is capable of out-performing some of the higher-end processors - even with a single-core processor. 
The computer itself is very good. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a good, fast, cheap laptop.

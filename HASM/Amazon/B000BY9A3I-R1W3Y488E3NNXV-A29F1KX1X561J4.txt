Title: Love it!
Content:
I've only had this little guy for about a month, but I love it!! I tend to buy cheaper vacuums and replace them every couple of years, so I can't say if this is super-quality, but it's exactly what I was looking for. I have a small 2BR/1BA house with hard woods, linoleum and area rugs - this is perfect for that. Putting it together was a snap. The power on the handle is brilliant and is not just off and on, you can slide from low to high power so you can choose which speed is best for the exact job you're doing at that moment, and the ease of switching out tools is wonderful. I can also use tools from my old Bissell (like the pet hair remover) and it fits right into the handle (where the broom stick would go) and it becomes quite a powerful little handheld tool! The retracting power cord is a great bonus and the dust bin (while small) is a breeze to empty! The only thing I would ask for is a better way to store all of the extra components, right now I have to sort of dangle the extra carpet head from a hook that it surely doesn't belong on, but other than that, this thing actually makes me 'want' to vacuum!!

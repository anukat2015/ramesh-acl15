Title: Cool toy, BUT...
Content:
If you dont have an iPhone already and not willing to switch to AT&T to use it, I would say this is as good as it gets for a "iPhone" minus the phone function.  I returned mine because it was too pricey for my use of its function.  Dont get me wrong, because this is a cool toy to have and to show off to your friends.  But I didnt want to carry iTouch and my cell phone in my pocket.  If you dont have any type of iPod, this could be one for you. But remember, Steve Jobs will continually plan ways to make you spend more money on his products... it's always gonna be bigger capacity, smaller, or just a wow factor added to the equation.

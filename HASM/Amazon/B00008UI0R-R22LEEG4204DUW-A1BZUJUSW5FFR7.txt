Title: This vacuum sucks...literally!  I LOVE IT!
Content:
This was a gift for my birthday after owning a vacuum that didn't do anything.  I am so happy my fiance bought this vacuum, it has three levels of suction and it REALLY sucks up all dirt on any surface.  My carpet looks new again after each time I vacuum.  In addition it comes with a flat floor attachment for the kitchen/bathroom floors as well as a stair attachment!  The stair attachment spits a little so you have to keep your distance but otherwise, it's a dream come true.  The floor attachment is adjustable and the canister is SO EASY to remove and empty.  I love this vacuum because instead of vacuuming twice a week, now I only vaccum once a week.

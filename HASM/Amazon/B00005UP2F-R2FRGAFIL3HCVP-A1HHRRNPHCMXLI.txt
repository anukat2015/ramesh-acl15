Title: This little vac is awesome
Content:
I decided to buy this despite all the bad reviews, and so far, so good.  I've had it about a month, and use it for everything in my home, including carpet, porcelain tile, hardwood flooring and lineoleum as well as my couch and chair and my bedspread and pillows.  I'm a new homeowner, and the 4 different flooring surfaces to clean were a bit daunting until I realized that this vacuum will clean them all without having to change attachments.  You can easily turn off the brush when going from carpet to hard floor, and this thing sucks up pet hair like you'd not believe out of the carpet and off the couch and chairs.  I have two cats who won't stay off my chenile couch, and this vacuum is powerful enough to suck up all the cat hair.  I can see where people have complained about accidentally pulling out the canister by reaching for the wrong handle, but I'm careful to grab hold of the handle on the body.  It's extremely lightweight, and portable enough to tote up and down three flights of stairs to clean up after the cat litter that goes everywhere.  I loved this so much that I bought one for my mother who had an older dirt devil canister vac which she loved, but had a broken strap.  My favorite features are the METAL extension tubes (I've not seen those on any vacumms since I was a wee kiddo) and the retractable cord.

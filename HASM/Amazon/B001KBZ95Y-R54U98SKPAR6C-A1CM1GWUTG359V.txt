Title: Carafe Handle Broke After A Few Months of Use!
Content:
I love the smallness of this unit, particularly as I am the only coffee-drinking person in the household! It is simple to use and easy to clean. Great for a quick morning coffee!
 
However I was very disappointed after purchasing this some months ago when the handle of the carafe became 'unattached', making it but unusable. I unsuccessfully tried many times to reattach it, which didn't work. 
I have since purchased another brand - A beautiful Cooks brand from JC Penney on sale. Hopefully more luck with this one!

Title: Grinder Basket
Content:
This is a great coffee maker. Best coffee I ever had using fresh coffee beans.  Ground coffee is great too, but I prefer the fresh coffee beans.  The ONLY problem I am having is with the grinder basket.  The blade unit is very loose.  It seems like when the water is pushed up to wash the coffee ground down into the filter basket, water is getting under the grinder blade unit, which is causing coffee to drip down against the back wall of craft unit.  I called about this problem and was told to contact Dependable Resouces.  They want the whole unit back because they don't sell parts.  We are buying the same coffee maker again and ordering another grinder basket from Cuisinart Parts & Service.  Now I can make Ice Coffee and Hot Coffee at the same time.

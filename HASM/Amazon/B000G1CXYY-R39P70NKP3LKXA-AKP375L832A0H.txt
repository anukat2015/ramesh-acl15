Title: Good for my purposes
Content:
This little heater is easy to use, will not heat up a 12 x 20 room to make it toasty, but that's not what I wanted it for.  I just wanted it to take the edge off the cool room when we had the prolonged cold spell we had (have?) here in Florida.  It works just fine for that purpose.  I doubt if it has enough "umph" to warm a room in a northern climate unless you leave it running constantly at max and then it would help but not be enough, but it does just fine down here.  It seems fairly well built, it has two wattages and a couple of fan speeds. It has a small "footprint" and can be placed almost anywhere in an open area and is fairly stable (as in it doesn't seem easily knocked over).  It seems reliable too.  The fan makes a little noise but nothing too intrusive.  I would buy another if I needed it.

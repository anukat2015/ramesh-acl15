Title: hot coffee hot
Content:
I dunno who needs to scrutinize every little detail, but this thing does what it's supposed to do. I have had it for a month now, and everything works as advertised.
Coffee stays 'steaming' hot in the thermos for a couple of hours. Set the timer in the morning and this coffeemaker never has to infringe on your morning routine.
My girl gets up at 5:30 a.m. and coffee is ready, hot, and waiting for her. She has a cup or two, and when I get outta' bed a few hours later, coffee that is still in the thermos is STILL hot!
Any little detail people complain about, ie. pour speed, or plastic heat-catching cap (for top) causing brewing problems, etc. : deal with it! These are not inconveniences, these are 'darwin-istic' features, ifyaknowwutimean!
Good product for us.

Title: don't waste your time and money
Content:
This is the third heater I've purchased in the last month. The first 2 were Lasko oscilating fans for "medium" sized rooms and they did not do the trick in our 85 year old home with a large living room and dining room. I didn't expect much from those considering they were under $40. So I took each back and kept seeing this heater and it was said to be used in "large" rooms. Finally, i thought, this is perfect! It was the last one so I figured it must be good!
I got it home very excited to get warm again! I plugged it in and kept in mind the booklet said it could take 20 minutes to really warm up. It's been 5 hours and although the heater is hot to the touch, hot enough that if you actually touched the metal you would get a pretty bad burn! I set the temp on the highest setting (which was 85). The room temp according to the heater was 70 and its only at 72! That's not even close to 85! 85 might seem a ridiculous temp but this room is quite large. 
Although it is very easy to set up and the digital reading is a plus, the fact that is is so large and gets so insanely hot and does not even perform the task of warming my living room I don't recommend this product. It was twice the price of the other smaller heaters and they did much better than this! I will be returning this as it is definitly not safe to have my 1 year old son around or my cat. At least the others put off more heat than this for a cheaper price and could be moved up high so the cat and child could not get hurt. 
I am very disappointed!

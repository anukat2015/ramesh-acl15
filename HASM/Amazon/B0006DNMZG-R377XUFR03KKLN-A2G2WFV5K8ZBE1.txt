Title: Fierce little heater!
Content:
I purchased this HZ-2200 on Amazon consumer rating.  Must I say the consumers were right on!  This little heater is much better than what I anticipated. Within 60 minutes on high, it will warm a moderate size room.  Afterwards, turn the thermostat to where it will regulate to room temperature.
I do recommend this product.

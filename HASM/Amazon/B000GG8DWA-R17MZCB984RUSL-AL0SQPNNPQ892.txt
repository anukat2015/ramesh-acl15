Title: Great Little Heater
Content:
We've had this heate for about a month.  We have a large open space that cannot be efficiently heated up, so we  needed something that heats our body without heating up the entire space.  This heater works great for that purpose. Even at 400W, it's toasty warm. We bought a second for our computer room. Though this is  not a space heater, it does warm up the room if the room is small (our computer room is about 8 x 10 ft). The heater doesn't take up much space, it's totally silent.  The heater also is set at a good angle. when we are sitting on a chair, the heater points at our feet and and lower leg.  When sitting on the follow, it warms up our body. So we didn't need to sit in an ackward position to get warm like we did with the Presto Parabolic heatdish that we end up returning.  Cons: the setting on the side dial is hard to see frm the front. We just make some marks on the front side of the dial and the problem is resolved. The cord is a little short, appx 1 meter long. Of the 2 we bought, only 1 released the odor other reviewers mentioned, but the odor burned off in a couple hours so it's not an issue.

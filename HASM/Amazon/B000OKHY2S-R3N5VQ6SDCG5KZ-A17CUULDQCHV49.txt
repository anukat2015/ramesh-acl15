Title: Great price for what it offers
Content:
OKay so my apartment is so !@#$ hot in Tucson, AZ that my poor, defenseless ferret would die if the rickety window A/C went out and I wasn't here to turn it off, wait 30 min, and turn it back on.  
This product (evaporative cooler) didn't affect the overall temperature that much (or at all really) but it creates a nice little "comfort zone" in front of it. 
Anyway, I'm happy enough to now buy a second one for the other room of the apartment.

Title: archos
Content:
its a neat product, looks good, has a big screen, is sexily slim and light. 
But since its a mobile product, i.e something you take with you on a long drive or on a flight, its battery life of only 4 hours is a limitation. And i assume that like a laptop, battery life reduces with age. makes it a bigger problem.  If i am on an international flight thats 10hrs, i cant charge it up any where midflight.   Battery life is a concern. should improve, or offer an extra battery as complimentary.

Title: Good MP3 Player, works well with Linux
Content:
Music works well with Linux - Grip or similar to rip .wav files off your CDs and convert them to .mp3; and just use regular file copies (bash or Nautilus) to move or remove files on MP3 player.
Voice recording is also good.  Creates .wav files with date in name, easy to transfer off MP3 player to Linux.
FM player is fine.
No documented method to put pictures or video on to player except included Windows "Media Converter" application. The JPEG pictures apparently need some specific format - a regular JPEG file does not work. I do not intend to use this for pictures or video, but I would add one more star if these were documented for use in Linux.
The CD also includes a Windows only application for access to the Rhapsody online music store. According to the Rhapsody web site, Mac and Linux users can use the Rhapsody service via browser.

Title: Great Camera, easy enough for novices
Content:
Product came as advertised and in just a couple days.  You can use it immediately out of the box without reading the guide, if needed (however, would suggest reviewing the operating guide) especially if you know something about photography.  Picture quality is excellent.  We replaced an Olympus 400 point and shoot.  Reason for replacing, picture quality and speed of shooting, with the Olympus would have to wait a bit between shooting pictures, sometime missing the photo you wanted to take, not the case with this camera.  Lots of options with the D80, more than we would probably ever use or need.  However, we love the camera.  Suggestion with one 4G smart media card on normal setting can shoot over 1000 pictures on one card, ond the fine setting you get about 500 on one card.
Now trying to find a good photo software package that is easy to use and not a huge computer hog.  Currently have Photoshop Elements 6.0, but seems to be a computer hog and a large learning curve.  Trying to find something different.  Any suggestions?
Have only had the camera for a couple months so still learning all the options.  Would put us in the category of novice or just above the novice in photography.

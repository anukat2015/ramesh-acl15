Title: Best Vacuum
Content:
all I can say is this is the best vacuum I have ever owned.  I mostly have wood floors and the bare floor attachment is by far the best, bigger than any other I've seen and it does great on the carpet as well.
It is bagless, and I guess that is a minus for some people, but I don't mind it, I just empty it into the trash in the garage.

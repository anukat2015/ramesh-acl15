Title: Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Vacuum
Content:
I read a ton of reviews before purchasing this vacuum because we were tired of spending so much money replacing vacuums that didn't live up to their hype. We have a Black Lab and white carpet throughout the house, so you can imagine the challenge previous vacuums have faced. We were very interested in purchasing the Dyson Animal vacuum based on early reviews, but simply couldn't justify spending so much on a cleaning tool! We waited until we had enough saved before making the decision, and I wanted to do more research before buying the very expensive Dyson.
Other users on Amazon recommended the Bissell very highly- even against the Dyson! Not only did we save hundreds of dollars, but we are VERY happy with the results of the Bissell. It comes with amazing tools to help pick up stuboorn pet hair on furniture, stairs, and along baseboards. I show everyone of our friends with pets the vacuum when they visit, and they can't belive the price difference with the Dyson. There is also a GREAT attachment on the front of the vacuum that works like a magic pet hair eraser for heavily coated areas. Very inventive! Works great- we love it. We also love the money we saved!
Thinking about getting one? Trust the reviews and make the purchase- you will not regret it!

Title: Truly remarkable.
Content:
A little context...I've shot a lot with a D200, even more with a D3, and most recently with the D3x.  Most of my work is in fashion, with a small bit of commercial product work here and there.
I must say - the images this camera produces are truly stunning.  Paired with a suitable lens, the detail is amazing...and other qualities, the more subjective ones like contrast and color, are hard to describe but are excellent and for my work, exceed the D3's already excellent capabilities.
But all the detail in the world can't help you if you can't count on the camera to deliver the shot...and that's where handling comes into play.  The D3 is, IMHO, the best-handling DSLR body in the world - a combination of the autofocus system and the camera controls (and the metering system, but I'm usually shooting in manual so don't rely on it often).  The D3x handles identically to the D3x (save for the frame rate), which is exactly what I would have hoped for.
I use this camera mostly at ISO 100; the files delivered are amazingly noise-free.  Sure, any camera can deliver at its base ISO...but you truly need to study these files to really understand the cleanliness and enlargement potential.
All in all, this is exactly what I hoped Nikon would deliver.  Sure, I'd rather it was cheaper...but if you want the best image quality in digital 35mm format that money can buy, this is it.

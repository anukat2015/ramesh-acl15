Title: Excellent!!!
Content:
First, I want to say that I am NOT a housework freak, but I can't believe how well this vacuum cleans.  And it's so quiet - I am amazed. But seeing as how I own so many German made products already, I shouldn't be surprised. The quality, ingenuity, and engineering excellence make this product a pleasure to use. The time it takes me to vacuum is cut in half, that's how effective this product is. I share my home with two large dogs and it picks up all their fur in no time. The parquet floor attachment I bought separately cleans the wood floors wonderfully even under the sofa and armoire. I am so glad I bought it; I only wish I hadn't wasted so much money on the Hoover's, Eureka's and Dirt Devil pieces of junk that I've had in the past and just hated. YAY!!! I finally have a vacuum cleaner that I love and love to use.

Title: Best I've had!
Content:
This item works fantastically.  I have a North American Grey Wolf who hates to go outside.  She has an extremely thick heavy coat, with a long outer coat, and a fine soft under coat.  Living in Tx, she sheds constantly... Year round... Never stops.  
This vaccuum is the best I have ever had. Picks up all the hair like a champ.  I almost forgot the color of my carpet until I got this vaccuum. Debris container is a little small,  the cord storage wrap hooks could be further apart (requiring less wrapping), but that is just nitpicking.  As a whole this item works perfectly.  I've had it for several months and it still works just like the day I got it.  Picks up dirt you can't even see.  When this one dies, I will defenitely be getting another one just like it. (if it is still available, and I hope it is.) If you have a lot of pet hair to get up...no worries...this is the one.

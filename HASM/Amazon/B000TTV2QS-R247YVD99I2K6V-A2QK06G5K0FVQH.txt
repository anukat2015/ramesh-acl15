Title: Wish it were stronger
Content:
My apartment is pretty wide open, so this doesnt spread heat too well if its in the living room.  I need to sit within 3 feet of it to feel any heat.  It works best for me when i have it in my room with the door closed.  Then its perfect.  The remote is very handy when in bed.

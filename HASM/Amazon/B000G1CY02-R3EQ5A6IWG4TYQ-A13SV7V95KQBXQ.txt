Title: The best - for small ~ normal sized rooms
Content:
I live in MA/NH area, right now our outside temp is: 20~40F. My interior temp is kept at 56~60F without this heater. For my small bedroom that measures 12' x 13' x 8' (150 sq.ft.), I only need this heater at low setting + #5 on the thermostat dial to maintain a comfortable temp of around 65~70F. For my office that measures 11' x 13' x 8' (140 sq.ft.), same thing. This heater is SILENT, so it's perfect for bedroom. But for my living room that measures 12' x 13' x 9' (150 sq.ft.) with open design (no closed door), this heater is insufficient. If your area is of open design with tall ceiling, use a heater w/ fan instead. But this thing is beautifully made. One big complaint is that DeLonghi chooses to use a huge sticker that leaves stubborn residue on the front, it took me well over 40 min. to get rid of that while assembly time was a mere 10 min., so lame, have they heard of easy-peel stickers that leave no/minimal residue? Also, check your local LOWES stores for this heater, cheaper & local pickup...

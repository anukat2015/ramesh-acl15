Title: Twice the camera compared to the D200
Content:
I owned a D200 for a few years and really loved the camera and the quality of the images.  Many reviews don't give the D300s the credit it deserves compared to the D200.  The D300s has many new features that increase the users ability to capture amazing images.  
I recommend purchasing David Busch's "Nikon D300s Guide to Digital SLR Photography" to learn all of the new features and to get the most from the camera.  His book is an easy read, though rather thick.  The illustrations are large and very useful.  He has a sense of humor and reading it is fun while you learn about the camera.
I've not spoken to any photographer who owns a D300s that doesn't love the camera.  You won't be disappointed.

Title: An excellent piece of machinery from Nikon
Content:
I did not buy this camera directly from Amazon but I am a frequent client of this site.  Despite that I am still on the learning curve of this device, I am extremelly impressed with the features it offers and with the gorgeous shots I am getting with it. Nikkor lenses are very fast and accurate that obviously complements perfectly the camera. The auto program will allow you to start shooting great pictures from the very beggining until you start to tweak all the feaures this baby has. It is indeed true that beats more expensive cameras like the Canon EOS 5D, specially comparing its performance with the amount of money you have to spend to get a couple of extra mega-pixels and a full-frame sensor. A job well done Nikon!

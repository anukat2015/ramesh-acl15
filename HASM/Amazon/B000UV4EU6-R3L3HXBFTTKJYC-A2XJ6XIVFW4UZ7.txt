Title: im a bit dissappointed
Content:
ok, so my other mp3 played broke last year around this time because my mother washed it. i was going to get an ipod, but my friend bought this and i thought it was cool so i asked my mom. she said yes, of course, because it's a whole lot cheaper. when i got it, it worked great. we were confused about putting music on, but after we understood it was breeze easy. 
when it started to have to reset a lot, and my favorite songs were always the ones that never went on right, i new that i had made a mistake. the lighting gets weird like every time i would turn it on. i would have to shut it off a lot because the screen went black. the volume is good. it holds pictures. the ear phones didn't last long, but had really good sound while they did. 
i would not recommend it to a friend. i feel betrayed by mine. haha p.s. my sister dropped my zen in juice two weeks ago, so i get to pick another mp3 player.

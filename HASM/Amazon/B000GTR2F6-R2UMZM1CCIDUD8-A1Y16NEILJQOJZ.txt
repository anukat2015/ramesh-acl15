Title: Love this Brewer...
Content:
I have been using this brewer about 1 month now.  
There are lots of options that can be programmed.  My favorite is the ability to turn the machine on at a predetermined time in the morning (I chose 5AM) so the water is hot and ready to go.  Then I have it set to turn itself off 3 hours after the last cup has been brewed.  Even if it is off, you can turn it on at any time and be ready to brew in a few minutes - it even remembers to turn itself off 3 hours later.
There is some vibration as the brewer fills the cup and then again as the brewer refills itself after brewing.  It only lasts 10 seconds or so and is not annoying at all.  The noise is sort of on the level of an electric can opener.
The coffee maker fits perfectly on the counter under the cabinet above even when completely open.  The water reservoir is easy to fill.  The coffee maker is nicely designed and looks amazing sitting there on the counter. 
It was fairly expensive - but well worth it.

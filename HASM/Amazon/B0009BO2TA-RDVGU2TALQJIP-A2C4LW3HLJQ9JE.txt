Title: Bad Orange!
Content:
Usable for small apartments or dorm rooms with bare wood/tile floors. Still, for 20 more bucks you could get a canister vac that doesn't fall apart, have tiny, toyish-looking attachments or smell like burning plastic everytime it heats up. I wish I'd repurchased my old canvac, Dirt Devil's Breeze. The filter on the Breeze is expensive to replace, so I went with the Hoover. Oh well, as I said, it'll do - for now.
PS . . . and *now* is three months after I wrote my initial review. The little orange Hoover is dead, killed by rust - throughout the wand and I suspect the motor as well. What a waste. Definitely don't buy this if you live in a humid climate.

Title: Nice, Attractive, and Powerful
Content:
I have had many HP PC's and Laptops, though they are not always the best option they usually carry more bang for the buck. This Laptop is no different dual core processor and 4 gigs of ram. So far I have had it over a year with absolutely no problems. It is very fast and can keep up with my memory extensive programs like (photoshop, lightroom, and Capture Pro 5.) Also it can handle multitasking very well with very minimal bottle necks/ overloaded memory. I have run lightroom and photoshop while downloading music and buring cd's all at the same time. Yes I am that good, but I lived on computers all of my life. I bought this laptop because it is made for artist and I am a photographer by trade. On of the things I loved the most is that when I show up at a job everyone compliments me on the design of my laptop. The only better laptops in my opion is a mac, sony vio, or a lenovo w700. I dont know about the reviewer below and why their laptops failed. But I believe that it may be due to user error or the way they took care of their equipment. But mine has been flawless and geourgous.

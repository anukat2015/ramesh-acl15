Title: When it's working, it's great
Content:
So you either love this vacuum or you hate it.  I've had mine for three months and have been able to vacuum with it 3 times.  I keep sending it to the repair shop because the power stops turning on.  One of the other reviews mentioned that if you leave it plugged in it shorts out the power button, this is true even if you only leave it plugged in long enough to move some furniture.  When I have had a chance to use it I have loved the job it does, it really has great suction and the filters are fabulous absolutly nothing is coming back out.  The power head is very noisy.  Be sure you check the return policy, I bought mine from another retailer here on Amazon and they won't take it back past 10 days (it was in the shop for the first time at 10 days) and Electrolux won't take it back either so I'm stuck with the thing til I can afford a new vacuum.  At least I'm not paying for the repairs the Electrolux warranty is covering them.  Still I'd like to vacuum more than once a month. ;)

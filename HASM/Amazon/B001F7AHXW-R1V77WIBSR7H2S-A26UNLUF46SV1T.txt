Title: So Here's A Legitimate Review...
Content:
So, instead of reading the reviews from JLabs, I thought I would submit my own.  I just received my iPod Classic 120GB.  It is my third iPod "Classic", having had a 3G and 5G.  We also own two 2G Nanos and one 2G shuffle.
So far, the Seventh Generation iPod Classic has been the best overall that I've owned.  My one complaint is similar to others in that the 7G does take a little extra time to execute commands.  I think that this is a small price to pay for all of the extra features, however.
My favorite thing about the 7G over the 5G is that it will play podcasts continuously.  Previously, I would have to scroll back through the menus to go to the next podcast in a list.  I also like the new EQ profiles Apple has added in the "settings" menu.  Given these settings, I can get just the right audio out of either my Bose Quiet comfort 3 headphones or my Shure earbuds.
Overall, I am VERY pleased with the current iPod Classic.  LOTS of storage in a small package...and great sound on top of that, what more could you ask for?

Title: Piece of junk!
Content:
I can't believe there are any positive reviews of this piece of junk.  After a great deal of research, we decided on the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser because our dog sheds a lot.  It worked fine for about 3 months...and then stopped picking up pretty much anything from the floors.  Its works so poorly sometimes I think it ADDS fur to the carpet.  I've tried to unclog it, use different settings, frequently empty it...it just doesn't work.

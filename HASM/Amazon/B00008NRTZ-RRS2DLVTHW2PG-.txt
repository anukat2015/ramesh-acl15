Title: 5 Star Performer
Content:
I am a big fan of canister vacuums, and when my old one recently broke I turned to Amazon to research all the latest models. I decided to buy the DigiPro because of the many features it offered for a great price. I am pleased to report that it performs better than I expected, and I was happy with my old one so I expected quite a bit. I like how it allows me to control the amount of suction power, the adjustments for various carpet heights/hard floors, and the ability to turn on/off the brushes. It has washable HEPA filters so there are no expensive filters to replace and it even has a light that comes on when it is time to change the bag. The cord has a push button retractor so the cord rewinds itself and stores out of the way. I have 3 kids, 1 dog, and 1 cat, so needless to say I have plenty to clean up. It's nice knowing that tucked away in the closet is a great vacuum that can help me tackle any mess. This vacuum is definitely worthy of a 5 star review.

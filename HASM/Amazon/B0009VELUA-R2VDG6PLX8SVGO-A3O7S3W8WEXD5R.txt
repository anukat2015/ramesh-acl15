Title: Think twice...
Content:
The first time I purchased this coffeemaker, it worked for about a month and then stopped.  When I lifted it, I noticed that there was a lot of water on the counter and down the back of the coffeemaker.  I also noticed that there was a little opening on the bottom of the coffeemaker that was sitting in the water.  I wondered if the water getting into the coffeemaker was the problem.  I returned the coffeemaker to the store and got another one, because I really liked it other than the leaking problem.  This time, on the way home, I stopped by another store and picked up a wire mesh desktop letter tray.  It looks tacky, but I turned it over and put it underneath the coffeemaker.  The water drips through the letter tray and doesn't pool under the coffeemaker itself.  Since then I've had no problems with it shutting off and it has been almost two years.  However, the clock has never worked and therefore, I've never been able to program it.  That wasn't important to me because I don't wake up to an alarm and would rather make the coffee when I needed it.  I mainly purchased it the first time because it didn't require a carafe.  I also like the clear beeping that signals when the coffee is done and when it shuts off after two hours.  It is easy to clean because the reservoir that holds the coffee lifts out.  This would also be the way you would have to fill a thermos because the dispensing area is not tall enough to accommodate some take-along thermal cups.  I may not purchase this particular product again, but I will find another coffeemaker that doesn't require a carafe.

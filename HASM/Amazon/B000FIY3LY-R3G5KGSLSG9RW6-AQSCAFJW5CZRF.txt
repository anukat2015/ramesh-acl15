Title: Variable quality
Content:
Little noisey, but works well. I use fans to enhance the cooling efficiency for larger spaces. Update:  Was very happy with the first one of these, the second one got banged up on shipping and was missing parts-did not appear to be new as advertized by Amazon. Since it is a heavy unit I haven't shipped the last one back and have yet to get anyone at AMCOR to supply the missing parts requested.  Mixed experience on this.

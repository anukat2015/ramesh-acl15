Title: One fine, fast D-SLR!
Content:
The D50 has all the Nikon quality I've come to expect. Images are excellent, of course. But the thing that most impresses me is how fast this camera is in every way that matters. When you turn it on, it's ready to shoot--no perceptible warm-up. When you press the shutter release, it shoots right then--not half a second later like many digital cameras, which miss critical shots. You can shoot in rapid sequence--no waiting around for it to process the last shot. It focuses fast, too. Spring for the extra money for a high-speed SD card and you'll get screaming transfer times, too.
The only complaint I have is the little rubber cover that hides the USB and other ports is a little hard to get smoothly all the way back into place. A pretty minor complaint.
An unexpected bonus compared to all the little digital point-and-shoot cameras I've used is the D50 has a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of 4:3. This means you're shooting the same aspect ratio as 35mm film (36mm x 24mm) and it conveniently fits a standard 4x6 print at your local photo processor without any unwanted cropping happening.

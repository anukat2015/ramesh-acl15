Title: Lovin' it.
Content:
Got this B70 several months ago. It still works beautifully. It is very pleasing to the eye. The filler system is top notch and keeps from halting in the middle of pouring a cup of coffee. I love the fact that you can do tea and coffee or even just plain water for a hot chocolate mix. Of course there are also K-cups for hot chocolate (even a yummy White Hot Chocolate). We move ours from home into our RV when we go camping and traveling. Works just as well on the road. There are many many different k-cups to choose from and the hardest thing about the Keurig B70 is the decision regarding what flavor of coffee or tea you will make in it.
It does make a loud hum when filling prior to brewing the cup, and again right after. However, I have had other brewing systems and they are louder and more grating on the nerves than the Keurig B70. The reservoir is on the side and is very easy to fill. I feel it is much easier to fill than other systems I have had. 
The K-cups are no mess, where as I have had other pods you have to lift out that are hot and dripping, no problem like that with the K-cups.However, if you wish to use up the pods you have left from the old brewing system, there is a little cup that you can purchase that fits inside the K-cup holder and allows you to insert the pods. You can even brew loose coffee by using the item made for that in the k-cup holder. The amount of beverage brewed per cup is adjustable, which is another great feature. The fact that the light (blue and very pleasing) is on to show the reservoir is a great idea. It lets you be able to see exactly how much water is left and that the brewing system is on.
A great little machine!

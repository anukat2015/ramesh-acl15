Title: 6730b - A great computer
Content:
I was looking for a new laptop for business use and decided to try the HP 6730b after an evening of research.  I was looking for a basic machine with a reasonable amount of processing power and a high resolution display, and no "crapware."  After about a month of use, I can say that this computer has exceeded my expectations in every way.  It comes with windows XP, but with an option to upgrade to Windows 7, which I have not done.  It also came with MS office preinstalled, which I plan on purchasing as soon as the trial period expires at the end of March.  The display is clean and crisp and the keyboard and mouse have a very good feel to them.  It does not have one of those glossy finishes that you often see on new PCs these days, so it does not attract finger prints and smuges as readily.  It also comes with a finger print reader built into the mouse pad; however, I have not tried this yet.  I guess it is for logging in via touch instead of typing a password.  It also seems to have some other interesting features/software built in, such as presentation software from HP to help you manage switching between normal use mode and presentation/projector modes; although I have noe yet mad use of these features.
Overall, I am very happy with this machine and would purchase the identical machine again.

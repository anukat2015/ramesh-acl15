I have owned one for 4 months now and am very pleased with it.  The reviewer that claims it can't take sharp photos is an idiot (he is no doubt the problem).   I have seen 30x40 prints shot with this (by Will Crockett) and they were amazing.  If you love Fuji film you will love the way this camera "sees". Fuji has tuned their software and electronics to record images with that fuji look.  Sure the body is plastic but I'm more interested in the quality of images and the images are simply the best.
10/04 I've now owned this camera over a year, I've had no problems and have am still very pleased.  Battery set-up could be better,and will be in the up-coming S3, but the this camera is all about image quality and I still believe it's the best of the bunch.
1/05 - Sold this camera last month.  Image quality was great but needing two type of batteries, and highh energy consumption are a major pain.  The CCD died on me, in the summer, while on a job, but was replaced by Fuji free of charge.  I'm awaiting my d200's arrival.  As happy as I am I'm glad to see it go.
2/05  I have my D200 now and really love it.  Higher battery consumption than my d70s but of course it also has a larger brighter monitor.  check out the D200, it rocks!
2/07 I love my D200 but still think the Fuji sensor results are closer to film and I look forward to the upcoming S5.  The D200 body with a Fuji sensor, it should be a great combination

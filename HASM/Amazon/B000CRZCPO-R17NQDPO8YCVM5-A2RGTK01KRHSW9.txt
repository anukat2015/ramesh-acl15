Title: Upgraded from D50
Content:
I upgraded to this body from the D50.  I was torn between the D80 and the D200, but after making the purchase, I have absolutley no regrets.  The amount of control over settings, and easy use of controls is great; though there was a learning curve.  Pictures are BIG sharp, the 5fps is amazing, and it's built like a tank.

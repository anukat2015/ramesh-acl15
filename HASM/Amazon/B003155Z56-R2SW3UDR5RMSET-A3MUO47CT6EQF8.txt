I also have an HP DV4t, half a dozen older Toshiba, Sony and HP notebooks, and a whole gaggle of netbooks. So I'm kind of addicted to cool portable hardware.
Among the myriad laptops & netbooks I've owned and used, this one is not the best, but certainly above-average.
Stylish, Core i3 is quick, memory & HDD are roomy. The screen is bright, color saturation is good but mildly washed out relative to the better panels out there. The 8" 1600x900 panel on Sony Vaio P-series is the worst color I've ever seen; this one is above average, just not the best. Beware that this unit (Amazon's, specifically) does not come with a backlit keyboard, which is part of the standard U505-S2005 build spec on Toshiba's website. I bought & installed the backlit keyboard separately, but it cost another $60. So actually this isn't a great deal, it's a cut-rate edition for a cut-rate price. If the backlit keyboard, bluetooth and slot-loading DVD don't really matter to you, then save yourself maybe $150 and snag one of these. Overall it's a very stylish case wrapped around some respectable hardware. However, if you don't care about the relatively compact 13" LCD or the fashionable presentation of the dark brown case, you might be just as well served with a standard 15.4" unit from HP or Acer, with similar hardware, for a couple hundred bucks less. That's true of any laptop that charges a premium for its design.
If you do care about the style and compactness, U505 is a great option.

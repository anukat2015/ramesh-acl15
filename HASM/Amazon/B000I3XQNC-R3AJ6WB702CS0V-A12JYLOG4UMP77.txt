Title: I'm in love
Content:
I'm an amateur photographer and I still have yet to take any classes to improve my knowledge but with my Rebel, I feel like a pro.  Purchasing a Canon digital SLR camera was well worth the extra money and I will never go back to the point and shoot models. This camera takes crisp, clear photos and is a joy to use.  I love it!!!

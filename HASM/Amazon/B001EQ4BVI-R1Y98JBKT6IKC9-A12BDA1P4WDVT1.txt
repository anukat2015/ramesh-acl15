Title: Canon 50 D DSLR
Content:
I love this camera. I delayed the transition to digital for as long as possible. All I can say is Wow. The Digic 4 image processor is remarkable, the way it records image detail and highlights. It has renewed my interest in photography. For me the camera has the size and weight to use with larger telephoto lenses.
 A not too complicated, high utility digital SLR.

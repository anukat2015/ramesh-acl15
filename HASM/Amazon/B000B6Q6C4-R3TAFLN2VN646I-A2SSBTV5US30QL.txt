Title: Quiet heat
Content:
My living room has three outside walls so it is anywhere from 3 to 5 degrees colder than the room with the thermostat.  I was looking for something to augment the heat in that room during the evening hours.  This product works perfectly.  It cracks a bit when it is first turned on (normal per instructions) but after that it is totally quiet.  (I haven't used the timer function - I suppose that might make a clicking sound)  I have only used the low (400 watt) setting and it is able to maintain an even temperature when the furnace (gas with hot air delivery) is cycled off.  The product has a solid, substantial feel to it and appears to be well made.  I would certainly recommend it.
ps: If you have carpeting put a board of some sort under the heater - it has a safety switch underneath it and won't work if the plunger isn't pressed in (which carpeting prevents).

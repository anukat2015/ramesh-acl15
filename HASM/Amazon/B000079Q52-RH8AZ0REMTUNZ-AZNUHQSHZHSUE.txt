Title: Be Sure To Buy Some Sunglasses With It!
Content:
It is everything it says but if you have it oscolating in front of you it is like a spotlight! The Halogen reflects off of the parabolic dome and blinds you everytime it faces you. If you like it dark when you watch TV at night this is a very bright night light. If you're just going to put it in the corner and not have it face you it's a great heater. We returned it in spite of all of its other great features.if you want parablolic try the coil based heaters like Holmes or the Windchaser models. They are not as efficient but they aren't so  bright either.

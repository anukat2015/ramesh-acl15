Title: Terrible Vacuum!
Content:
When we first got this vacuum I was so excited to use it.  It's very cute!  Parts of it do look cheap, but it's very modern and sleek looking for the most part.  At first it cleaned great, but withing a few months we were replacing the roller.  After that it all went downhill.  We have had it 9 months it was not cleaning half as good as my moms 10 year old kenmore, and we are assumming some of the electrical wiring when out in the the hose.  It's shot.  We are trying to see what the company will do.  I am not interested in this again.  I would like to just give the extra money once and for all and buy a nice vacumm!

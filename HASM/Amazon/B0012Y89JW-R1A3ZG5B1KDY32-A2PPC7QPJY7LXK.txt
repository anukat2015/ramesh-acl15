Title: Canon Camera
Content:
I just received the camera and have been playing with it on some photos. I am not a professional photographer so it is taking me a while to handle the camera. I like the way my photos have been coming out and used one photo for a Christmas Card. The reason I gave the display only 3 stars was simply that I don't see the image before I shoot it and can't get everyone into the photo on the picture. I am sure if I read through the book there is a solution to this, but I just haven't done so yet.
I love this camera and can't wait to see all that it is capable of in the future.

Title: Small, light, and it really sucks
Content:
First my requirements, I live in a 3 story house with a basement, have a cat, hardwood floors, stair runners, and oriental rugs.  Oriental rugs should not be cleaned with a beater bar attachment.  Wow, this vacuum is fantastic.  Usually I only have enough ambition to clean one floor at a time.  This weekend I did two floors and the basement.  It was almost like a new toy.  The vacuum is so light, 14 lbs, about half the weight of a quality vacuum.  The suction power is remarkable, as strong as my husband's Fenn (German) shopvac.  And it is very quiet.  It is very good at picking up the cat hair from upholestry.  Of course, a beater bar attachment would be better but it doesn't make sense for me with the oriental rugs.  It cleans hardwood floors so well that I'm giving away my swifter duster.  I will definitely make Miele my first choice for any new appliances.

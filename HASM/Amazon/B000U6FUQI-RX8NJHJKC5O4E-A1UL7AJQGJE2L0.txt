Title: awesome
Content:
I received this vacuum for Christmas, it works great. I have four small children in my home so I use it frequently. This vac picks up Cheerios with ease, I can even vacuum throw rugs with it. So quick, no cord to tangle,I like it better than my Oreck canister vacuum. It glides across the floor and around furniture.

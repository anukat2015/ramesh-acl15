Title: Canon Rebel XSi
Content:
I've had this camera a couple of weeks now and it is super nice.  I also own one of the digital elf cameras and it is a great camera as well.  The Rebel XSi lets you have as much control or as little as you desire. It has been easy to learn how to use and takes awesome photos.  The 18-55mm USM IS kit lense by Canon is lightweight, and takes a second to focus. I also bought the Canon 28-105mm USM II lense and am very satisfied. 
If you're trying to decide between a Sony Alpha or a Canon Rebel, I suggest going to a store where you can hold both cameras and then buy it from Amazon. The Canon feels and looks like a more durable and higher quality camera.

Title: Good Coffee
Content:
This machine makes very good coffee.  It keeps it fresh and hot all day long.  I've used a variety of thermal-carafe coffeemakers over the years, and none keeps the coffee hot as long as this one does.
I've been using this machine for almost two years.  I was concerned about the leakage mentioned by other reviewers, so I've always been careful to assemble the parts correctly.  I've never had any problems with leaking or spilling.  I fill coffeemaker up to within 1/4" of the overflow hole in the water reservoir.  The water reservoir isn't removable; I fill it with my pull-out kitchen faucet, which works just fine.
This model met most of my criteria when I was researching coffeemakers.  It has a stainless steel thermal carafe, 12-cup capacity, it's programmable, and it's available in white.  I would have preferred that the controls be mounted near the top of the machine, but they're at the bottom where they're more subject to spills.
The carafe is very well-constructed.  The pour-through lid is nifty, but it's hard to clean.  Every so often, it does need cleaning, and it doesn't disassemble completely.  The rest of the coffeemaker is not as well-made; not bad, but not great.  The buttons and the clock are teeny-tiny.  The filter door cannot be removed from the coffeemaker for cleaning.
Would I buy it again?  Yes, I think so.  It makes very good coffee, and it keeps it fresh and hot.

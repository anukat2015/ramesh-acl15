Title: good to the last drop
Content:
Makes a great cup of coffee, built in grinder is great, just fill, set time and presto its done. If you like starbucks or other high priced coffee try grinding your own beans.Ya'll buy a   built in ginder again. The unit works great,best coffee flavor, only draw back is you must clean the grinder each day, several parts to wash but it only takes minutes, I like the filter' just wash and reuse.

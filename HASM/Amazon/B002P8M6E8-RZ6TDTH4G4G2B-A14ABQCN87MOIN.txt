Title: The best of the best ... The best price laptop under $ 600
Content:
I was looking for a laptop that was very fast, with enough hard drive with an excellent display of 15.6" with High Definition. And I find this computer...
And the best thing I did not have the system inefficient Video Intel GMA 4500 (very bad performance). Otherwise brings excellent and very efficient AMD graphic system ATI Radeon HD 4200. Very good for watching movies in high definition (but does not have BlueRay disc drive) has an excellent performance in midrange game.
One thing I liked is its price, you can search and find laptops with these features: 500GB hard drive, video ATI Radeon HD 4200, a dual processor (2.2GHz Turion II comparable in performance with a Core2Duo 2GHz) and always over $ 600. In my case I took the year-end prices, especially on Black Friday and left at $ 549, an excellent price for the features it has.
Excellent performance in data processing, this thanks to the 64bit and its new operating system (Windows 7 64Bit).
ACER is perfect to me...

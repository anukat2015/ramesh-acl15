Title: Hoover Wind Tunnel Canister Vacuum
Content:
I am going to be 65 soon, therefore, I've used alot of different brands of sweepers in my lifetime, and Hoover is by far the best one I've ever had.  I've used Kirby, Phantom, Kenmore, Dirt Devil, Rainbow, Oreck, and a few cheaper brands, and Hoover out weighs them all.  Excellect suction all the way around, light weight, and I love the fact that there are NO BAGS, which over time cost a fortune.  It don't lose suction at all, and is very versatile.  I would highly recommend this sweeper to anyone.  Also dealing with Amazon is great....

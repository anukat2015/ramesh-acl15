Title: Water reservoir a problem.
Content:
I purchased the Cuisinart DCC-1200 to replace a Cuisinart Grind and Brew that quit grinding.  It's a good machine but has one drawback;  the water indicator is inside the water reservoir and hard to read.  I have to guess as to how much water I've put into the reservoir.

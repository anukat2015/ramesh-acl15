Title: Worst product ever
Content:
Purchased model EL 7001 two years ago from Best buy. It is the most poorly built problematic device I have ever encountered. I have had it replaced three times and now it will be discarded and I eill never purchase any thing represented by Electrolux. Do 
your self a big favor and try to contact customer service. Good luck.

Title: First dSLR and I love it!!
Content:
I just wanted to stop by and say this camera is great! I had a canon p&s but wanted to advance to something better and this was easy for me to figure out quickly. I'm still learning a lot about photography and dslr's so excuse my "ignorance" :). I take my camera with me almost everywhere I go and use it daily. I definitely recommend the d90.

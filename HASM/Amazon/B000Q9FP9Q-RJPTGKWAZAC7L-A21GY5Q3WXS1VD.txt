Title: Same as Tayama Air Cooler TC-998-BAD!
Content:
This unit is the same as the Tayama Air Cooler TC-998 and works as poorly.
Only after filling the entire tray with ice and water chilled overnight does this thing have any cooling effect and even than, it's only for an hour or so.
Anything less then ice and ice water will do nothing more than generate humidity and waste power.
Save your money and buy a real AC unit for supplemental cooling.

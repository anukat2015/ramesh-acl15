Title: WAIT FOR WINDOWS 7, VISTA IS REALLY BAD
Content:
This is a great laptop, but unfortunately Vista is a real bad Operating System.  I have several conflicts trying to run my old software in Vista, so you must upgrade all your programs to work or try to work in Vista.
I bought this laptop to replace a desktop.  It is a power laptop, but it is also heavy and consume energy so your battery will last for less than 2 hours, but it works fine for me because I was replacing a desktop.  
Again, it is a Good laptop, but WAIT for a new Operating system that will be released in October or November this year.  If you buy your laptop now, no one will support your migration to the new operating system.

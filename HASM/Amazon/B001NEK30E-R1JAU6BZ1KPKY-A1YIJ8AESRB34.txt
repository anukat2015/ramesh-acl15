Title: Just right
Content:
I have had this computer for 2 weeks and I must say that I could not ask for anything more. The letterbox screen is just wonderful. The screen measures smaller than my not so dearly departed desktop, but seems twice as big with beautiful resolution. The speakers are quite fine. I am listening to Wisconsin Public Radio HD classical musio as I type this and am completely satisfied with the sound. Not everyone will be. The keypad is very easy to use. The computer comes with more add-ons that I would ever be able to use. Case and keyboard smudges are insignifanct when compared to the entire quality of this product.

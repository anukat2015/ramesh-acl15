Title: Definitely not for heating up an entire room
Content:
The dish sends out very high heat in one direction. As said before, takes a long time to actually heat an entire room. Also, if you are in the way of the heat beam, sitting less that 10 feet near, your skin starts to burn due to the intensity.
Not worth the cost. But again, there may be uses for this kind of a heating device that I am not aware of..

Title: A skeptic's review
Content:
As a lifelong skeptic, I caved and purchased one on the recommendation of a friend.  I wanted to warm a large area of the basement without diverting heat away from the main floor.  Set on low, this device warmed a 25x15 foot area.  The first utility bills have shown a very small increase in electrical usage.  Although it is quite easy to move, I purchased a second one for use wherever needed.

Title: Filter is a bear!!  Suction incredible!
Content:
I mostly love our new Windtunnel bagless vac. It has incredible suction, great attachments and I enjoy being able to adjust the suction control on the handle.  I bought it mainly for our hard surface floors, but have realized how good it is on our carpeting as well.  The main gripe I have is the filter is a complete bear to clean.  It takes a good 20-30 minutes if you want to clean out all the fibers and dirt.  If you have a second vacuum, it helps reduce the time to a few minutes if you vacuum out the filter.  If one end of the filter cartridge would come off, it would make cleaning it much easier.

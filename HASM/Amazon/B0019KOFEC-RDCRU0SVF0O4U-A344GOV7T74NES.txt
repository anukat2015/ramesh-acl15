Title: Great for hard floors and stairs
Content:
I bought this vacuum to do my hard word floors and uncarpeted stairs and it is great.  It is small enough to place on a step in front of you as you do a stairway but also light enough to pick up easily. It has great suction.  I used it over two weeks ago and I still don't see much dirt accumulating on stairs or in corners which I find will happen if areas are not thoroughly cleaned. It is one of the few small vacuums with a bag.  I hate bagless vacuums.  What is the point of vacuuming especially with all of those filters and then spewing dirt everywhere when you empty the dust container?  And then having to use a second vacuum to clean the filters?  I haven't used this one on carpets (I have Eureka uprights for that) and I haven't used the pet paw  (I don't have a pet... got it just in case) and I haven't had it long enough to speak to its longevity, but so far I am delighted.

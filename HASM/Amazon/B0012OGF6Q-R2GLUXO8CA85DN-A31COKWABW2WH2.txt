Title: The D60: When 10.2 MP Are More Than Enough
Content:
I purchased my D-60 as a kit that included not only the camera but also two VR lenses (18-55mm and 55-200mm), gadget bag, 2 instructional DVD's, Nikon Capture software and a 2 GB San-Disk SD card for a total of $[...]. Having had a D-70s in the past, I found that the "learning curve" with the D-60 is not nearly as steep as some might make you believe.
While considered a mid-level "pro-am" camera, the D-60 takes remarkably clear shots and has the added advantage of allowing the use of almost any Nikon lens available, be it 25 years old or 2.5 months old. After having trailed Canon for a while in the "self-cleaning sensor" department, the D-60 shows Nikon has finally adopted this feature. All I can say is, "It's about time". At last, I no longer have to take my camera in for its annual "sensor scrub". Halleluah!
The D-60 has 2.5MP less resolution than the new D-5000. I started to get one of those, but couldn't see paying an extra [...] bucks for a lousy 2.5MP resolution gain. I'm not planning on blowing my pictures up to wall size or billboard size so there was no way to justify the extra expense. Besides, the D-60 does everything I want it to. Plus, it allows "in camera" red-eye correction, cropping and some basic editing. You can also switch a photo from color to B&W, Sepia or Cyanotype all inside the camera (though it DOES keep the original color shot when it creates the new "color edited" picture). 
The only "complaint" (if you can really call it that) is that the D-60 still does not have the "Full Frame Sensor". Instead of WYSIWYG, you get 92% of what you see in the viewfinder. While this is not a major issue as long as you're aware of it, it would have been nice to see Nikon upgrade the D-60 with the same FFS it has in some of its higher end digital SLR's.
For the price, I can't beat what I have with a stick! The D-60 is an excellent camera and (in my opinion) the best camera to usae to introduce anyone into the world of digital SLR photography.

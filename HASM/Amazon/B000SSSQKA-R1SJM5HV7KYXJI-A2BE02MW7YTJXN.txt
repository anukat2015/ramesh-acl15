Title: Great for Wood Floors
Content:
I have a heavy Kirby vacuum that I used for the carpets that also had an attachment for wood floors.  Pulling the upright along while cleaning the wood floors was the pits.  It kept falling over and wouldn't round the corners.  The wand had to be cleaned every minute.  I got this Panasonic vacuum strictly for the wood floors.  I love it!  It is small and lightweight, but has good suction.  I can zoom around everything with ease.  The floor attachment has a spinning brush powered by the vacuum suction.  It sweeps the wood floor clean while sucking up the dirt.  It works great!  It is not a vacuum for carpets.  On carpets, it would only act as a carpet sweeper.  So, if you have a good upright for carpets and need something for the wood floors, or your tile kitchen and bathroom floors, give this one a try.  The cord is short, but retracts into the machine.  That is the only downside of this vac.

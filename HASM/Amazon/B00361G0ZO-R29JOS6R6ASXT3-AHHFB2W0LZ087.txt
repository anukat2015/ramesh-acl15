Title: Great buy great price
Content:
Used this for a little over a month now and for the money its great. Can play pretty much every game out with great frame rates and doesn't have a cooling problem at all. Bloatware is easy to remove and a total reformat takes around 2 hours. Goto notebookreview if you need info on that. Notebook looks great and backlit chiclet keyboard is awesome. Has many little cool features like switch to kill wireless and hd and vga outs. Full 1080p res is awesome even though screen is small.  Overall its a great computer at a great price.

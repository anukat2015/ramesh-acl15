Title: Just The Thermostats We Needed
Content:
We purchased two of these thermostats to use with our baseboard hot water heat system, due to the huge increases in heating oil costs.  We do not have central a/c.  We work varied hours/days so we wanted the 7-day programmable model.  We are very happy with how effortlessly this thermostat works, though setting it can be a bit tedious.  But, once you get it where you want it, there is nothing to do but push the "home today" button when we're unexpectedly home or increase/decrease the set temperature with a quick keypad push.  Overall, we are very satisfied with this unit.  We do notice the "click" mentioned by another reviewer, but find that it is not objectionable.  It's one of those noises that you stop hearing after awhile like any other repetitive household noise.  For the price and the tighter control of your energy usage this is a good thermostat to purchase.

Title: sending it back
Content:
Getting ready to send it back for a replacement for the second time.  Coffee maker brews great but after a few weeks, fails to complete the brew cycle and leaves the water in the tank.
This can't be limited to mine as this is the second one we have had in three months with the same exact problem....

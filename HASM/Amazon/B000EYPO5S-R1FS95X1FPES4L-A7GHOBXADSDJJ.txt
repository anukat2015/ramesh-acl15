Title: Be ALERT - carefull when buying a DELL laptop
Content:
I am an IT person, and have used and tested many and many laptops. My Dell B130 works well as any other Dell I have had on the past (about 4) - However, I know its keyboard will fail within 1 year or so. The reason I know is that all my Dell laptops did. I still have an Inspiron 700m which I already replaced its keyboard twice in 3 years. The average is if you use the laptop daily, you will start having problems with your keyboard in about 1 year.
I am not saying that the rest of the computer is bad, but I believe Dell is making a lot of monye just selling keyboards for $25.00 
GOOD TIP:
========
If you want to know if your laptop has a WEAK keyboard, just go to ebay and look for its keyboard... if you find MANY of them, it means that it has a weak keyboard and will fail some keys in 1 year or less. This tip works for any laptop.
I believe my next laptop will be a LENOVO.

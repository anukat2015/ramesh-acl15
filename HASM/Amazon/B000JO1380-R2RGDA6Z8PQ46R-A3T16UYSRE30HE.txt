Title: Can't believe I didn't buy one sooner.
Content:
This is great!!! Lots of storage for everything.  I am loving the podcasts.  I do notice a lag in the wheel at times, but it's not that big of a deal.  This is the first Ipod I have owned, so I am going through a learning process.  It's fairly easy to use, and has a ton of accessories.  I am really happy with my purchase.

Title: Stopped Working after 14 months - Canon has BAD customer service
Content:
I bought my digital rebel in late October 2005 from Amazon. Loved it, until one day just before Christmas it wouldn't turn on. No power, nothing. Changed batteries. Called Canon tech support, who ran me through a few things to try and then told me I'd have to send it to a repair center. Went through the holidays with a borrowed digital so as to no have to dust off my Canon Elan and use film. Paid [...] to ship my digital to Canon, and finally TODAY I received a letter in the mail (have they not heard of email or even the telephone???) that is a standardized form for repair with a minimum [...] fee - they have not even looked at my camera yet.
Why could Canon not have told me that would be the minimum cost when I called tech services and got the shipping info and asked if they had any idea on repair charges?? Why couldn't they have said "ship it with a $211.65 check to..." This camera cost [...] when I bought it. Am I wrong to think a $900 camera should last more than 14 months??
Considering that the cost of a new body is not much more than the  minimum repair price I am EXTREMELY unhappy with this situation. On top of this, when I called to discuss it with them today the only consolation I was offered was - they will ship it back for free if I don't have it repaired. If I do have it repaired, it will cost me [...] to have it shipped back. How does that make sense?
This is the worst customer service ever. And I've already been without a camera for over a month. I am at the end of my rope with Canon.

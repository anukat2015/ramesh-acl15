Title: An Exceptional Camera
Content:
I purchased this kit about a month ago, and had the opportunity to recently photograph an all day wedding.  I took better than 600 images without any problems whatsoever.  99% of the images are great, while the remaining 1% are the product of photographer error.  This is a workhorse of a camera.  At times I was taking images as fast as I could press the shutter, and the auto focus responded wonderfully, allowing for crystal clear pictures in sequence.  I do not consider myself a professional photographer, but I can take good pictures, and this camera made it easy.  My pictures looked professional!!
I highly recommend this camera and the accompanying lens.  Sure, you can pay a lot more, but if you want professional quality without going completely broke, this is the one!

Title: Durable, no, cool features yes, but wortless in the end
Content:
We bought this in November of 2005 and with in 90 days the front roller had to be replaced. It does clean well when it works, but we use it about once a month, so that means we are on the 15th or so use of it and it just gave up the ghost totally. I would say stay away from this thing unless you can buy it for $30 or less.

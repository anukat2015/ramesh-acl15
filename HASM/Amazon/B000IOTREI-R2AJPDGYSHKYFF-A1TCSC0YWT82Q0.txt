Title: Find the best spot for it, and you'll be happy..
Content:
Earlier this year, I received an electric bill for $[...]! Whaa?? I'm rarely home, and not home long enough to create anything that huge; and use all the energy saving features on my thermostat, including the default temperature setting of SIXTY degrees for while I'm at work! After calling the electric company, AND an electrician to find the problem, only to discover nothing abnormal, it was time for me to check out portable heaters. This one was my first purchase, having seen it at Costco, which is where I bought it, and is half the price shown here.
Two of my rooms have high ceilings and one of those is a large, open area, while the other is the Master. It does not heat the large open room very well, yet it will heat up the Master, just fine. The smallest room is my office, and it heats it up so well, I use a low setting. Also, my Master bath is a wide open area (no doorway) from the Master. I set up the HeatDish before showering, and by the time I'm blow drying my hair and doing makeup, I'm almost HOT from the heat, 20 feet away. 
It does a great job as long as you understand it's functionality.

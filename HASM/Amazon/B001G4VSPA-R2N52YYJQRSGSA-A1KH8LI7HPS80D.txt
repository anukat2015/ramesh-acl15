Title: Saves $$$ and is the BENCHMARK of space heaters!
Content:
After purchasing the previous model about 3 years ago for my basement, decided to buy another one for my bedroom at night instead of running the gas heat.  Not only does it help those of us that are irritated by gas heat as it drys out the air, the biggest thing is you save alot of money as you are only heating the room you need to instead of an entire floor.
This new designed is improved on the previous one as heat comes out the top and the side.
You cannot go wrong with this Bionaire model unless you think it is intended to heat rooms with high ceilings which is not the case as anyone who knows a thing about heat knows heat rises.  You cannot be disappointed in the product then when you buy the wrong kind of product to begin with.
Thanks Bionaire!

Title: Awesome Little Heater
Content:
I am the kind of guy who searches a lot and reads as many reviews as possible before buying something. So, when I read all the positive reviews on Amazon I decided to give this heater a try to cut down on the gas bill so I picked one up from Target. When I came back home my wife said this thing is way too small to warm up even a small room. A few minutes after plugging it in she was surprised by the amount heat this cute heater produces. It can heat a small to medium sized room with no problem. I highly recommend this heater. Now I am waiting for my bills to see if it helped me save some money.

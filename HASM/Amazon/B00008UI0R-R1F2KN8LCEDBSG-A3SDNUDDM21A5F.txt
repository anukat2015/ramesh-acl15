Title: great suction
Content:
This is the first vacuum I've had that actually has enough suction so that the small rotating brush attachment works!  It does a wonderful job on carpeted stairs and everything eles. The adjustable suction is fabulous! Use low to clean lampshades etc and high for all the pet hair.  Goes effortlessly from wood floors to carpet and does great on both.  No dusty smell left after vacuuming.

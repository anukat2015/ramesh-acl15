Title: Warning: power failure and heavy
Content:
This vacuum broke down (electrical power) less than 5 months after I bought it last year (was used less than a dozen times). Had to take it for repair at an inconvenient location far from my house, and it was in shop for more than a month. Unreliable to say the least!
The bags also fill up very quickly and are awkward and difficult to attach. If you don't attach them just right, you have an awful mess inside the vacuum.
I miss my former cannister (Bissell), which is no longer made.
The cannister is also terribly heavy. I intensely disloke using it, and would return it in a minute for another vacuum if I could. A disadvantage of buying from Amazon (vs. Costco).

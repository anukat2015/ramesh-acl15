It has several safety features: it turns off if tipped over, it has child-resistant ON knob which is nevertheless easy for old folks to turn!  It is compact and sleek and light-weight to move; however, it does not have a handle.
I bought a second one for my son's downstairs room which gets colder than the rest of the house in winter, and he is pleased with it.  I found the second one in a local store for ten dollars less than the on-line price...

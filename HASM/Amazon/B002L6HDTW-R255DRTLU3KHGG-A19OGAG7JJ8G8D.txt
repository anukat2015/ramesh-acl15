Title: iPod nano 5G 16GB
Content:
I purchased this iPod after my beloved 60GB iPod video was stolen. It has a nice design and it is very portable. The video camera and radio are nice features, although I haven't used either extensively. I mainly use it to listen to music which is why I gave it four out of five stars. Unlike my previous iPod, wakeup time when in powersaver mode is extremely slow. I will press the next or center button after I have been listening to music for a while and it will take about three seconds to either show me what song is playing or change the song. My older iPod did these things almost instantaneously. Secondly! My least favorite part about this new iPod is the battery life!! It says on the website that it is 24 hours but mine will only play for about nine. I have the brightness turned all the way down and the energy saver is on. Neither of these boost my battery life to 24 hours. As I mentioned above I mainly use this to listen to songs so there should not be that much strain on the battery. I have researched and this seems to be a problem for most people with these iPods. This is a good music player with good sound quality. The video camera also records very well (except in low light) and the radio is nice too. If you are a patient person you will not mind the slow wakeups and song changes but if you're used to the older videos they are much faster. Also battery life is horrible and definitely not 24 hours like it says on the website.

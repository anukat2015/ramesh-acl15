Title: No more bagless for me!
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner more than a year ago and here are my pros:
- does a great job getting up the dirt
- is lightweight and easy to carry from room to room
- the hose wraps itself up
- the controls are easy to access and use
- the head is flat enough to slip under low chairs
- and all the other stuff people have said is great about it.
My one con is that it is bagless.  So, as someone else said, it makes quite a dust bowl when it gets dumped, and even worse, the filter is a bear to clean.  It takes me a good 30 minutes just to get most (not all) of the dust and cat hair out of the filter after one use (and, yes, I do vacuum regularly).  If I decide to wash the filter then I can not use the vacuum for at least a day waiting for the filter to dry out.  The filter is not something you can replace cheaply like a bag would be so you have to either clean it or else let it get REALLY clogged up with dust.  I am very sorry I bought the bagless model and I will never do so again.

Title: Generally positive
Content:
Generally I like this heater. I am using it in a very large room - 18ftx36ft - but near my desk/window to take the edge off the chill in my office. I find that it does this well, and would probably heat a small room nicely. Also, I love the timer feature. It lets me make sure it turns off when I leave the office, so that I don't forget.

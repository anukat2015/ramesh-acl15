Title: Really happy with it
Content:
This was my first DSLR. I have been using older manual 35mm SLRs which really is a good background. Overall I am really happy with it. Some comments:
-If you're looking at the D50 with the 18-50mm lens, really consider the D70 kit with the 18-70mm lens. I was going to get the D50 body only and buy this lens but the kit price of this package with this lens made it a no brainer. The 18-70mm lens is built better and I found I really needed the 70mm end of the lens often, plus having a much bigger zoom range without changing lenses. But also watch out becuase on the 35mm end there is a little barrel distortion on the edges of the pictures. (pretty minor though)
-The camera is extremely intuitive. I bought this camera right before I went to Burning Man and had snapped about 300 frames before I really dug into the manual. There are many many options in the menus that are pretty much self-explanatory.
-The battery life is phenomenal. I have a 1GB hi-speed CF card, and I can fill it up almost twice before running out of battery (about 700 pictures with occasional flash use)
My only complaints are minor:
-The slight distortion on the wide angle
-The viewfider is a litle small (although I have good eyesight and it hasn't been an issue)
-I wish the LCD screen was a little bigger.
-USB 2 would be nice, but for how seldom I have to dump pictures (I get about 500 on a card) it's not a big deal. You can just buy a CF reader and a 2nd card.
-Avoid the 1600 ISO setting unless you really really need it. It gets pretty grainy.

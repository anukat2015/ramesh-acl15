Title: Fantastic features...a better camera than a Canon of same class.
Content:
This camera has a lot of great features.  I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he takes it everywhere. It's a great SLR camera.  Nikon has a great product here..the quality of the pictures are phenomenal.  It's very easy to use and we're so glad we have it to take on our adventures.

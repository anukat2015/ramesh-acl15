Content:
this is THE BEST !! vacuum I ever had and I have tried a lot;
it picks up cat litter sand better than any other from the floor;
 it is easy to maneuver , the noise level is a lot quieter than other vacuums;
I use it mainly for daily pickup, pet hair, cat litter sand etc.. 
I recommend this vacuum for anybody who needs a GOOD daily vacuum;
the buttons to turn it on are on top on the handle, the cable roll up with a foot step, what more do you want; I don't have to bent down anymore :)
all in all
very easy to handle

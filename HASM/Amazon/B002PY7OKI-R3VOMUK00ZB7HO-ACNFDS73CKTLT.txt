Title: Keyboard problem and other info
Content:
I've owned this computer for about a month and paid $540.  The people who were able to get it for $300 did very well as it's not a bad machine.  The keyboard problem is a software / driver issue.  Notice that it only occures in Internet Explorer.  Call Dell tech support.  They can fix it.

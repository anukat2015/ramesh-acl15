Title: Indoor pool application
Content:
I bought this for my indoor swimming pool. Even with the furnace heat you still need that extra warmth to make it feel like Miami Beach in NJ in January. I could not find a better looking heater and my only dislike is that this looks too much like a garage heater which it is. This unit comes with a thermostat and requires no electricity which would also be useful in the event of a power failure. I am still not sure how the thermostat manages to work without electricity.
I placed my unit so it casts the infra red heat right in the middle of the pool and has an effective floor area of about 18 by 18 feet when placed 15 feet above. Since the swimming pool is at the lowest level and cold air tends to settle to the lowest  level this heater comes in very handy even when the water is heated and the furnace is blowing warm air. It also feels like the sun when you come out of the water even if you are wet. If you close your eyes you can almost imagine you were on a beach in Hawaii. I am thinking about buying another one for the deep end.

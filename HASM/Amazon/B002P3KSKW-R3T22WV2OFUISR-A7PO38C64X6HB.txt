Title: Waited 3 months for this laptop and it was worth it
Content:
Amazing laptop. Long battery life. I went from an older 14 inch Acer to this one. Twice the CPU speed, less than 1/3 the power usage. It's quiet, cool, light and runs a great OS with 64bits. You can get a machine smaller, lighter, or faster but nobody has beaten this package. Also, it looks great. Sophisticated and clean no shiny plastic that shows every fingerprint and scratch. The  keyboard seemed a bit strange at first but I'm up to full speed on it after about an hour. 
This model has a dual core CPU. Don't bother with the older Acer Timelines with the 2700 or 3500 single cores. That was just a warm up until the real stuff came out from Intel.
I like this machine so much, I'm thinking about spending another $300 on a solid state drive.
The only negative I found is the crapware that comes installed and having to waste an hour or more uninstalling software.

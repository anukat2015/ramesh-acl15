Title: I love this coffee maker!!!
Content:
I've read so many negative reviews, but I have found this coffee maker to be wonderful. Every morning I have fresh piping hot coffee waiting for me when I get up.  Even 4 hours later, the coffee is still hot, and still fresh tasting, since there is no heated burner.
Yes, the grinder is loud (but I can't hear it since the coffee maker is downstairs).  My handheld grinder is just as loud - that's what you have to experience if you're going to have freshly ground beans.  And yes, there are parts to clean - I either put the parts in the dishwasher, or give them a quick rinse before I set up the coffee for the morning. 
Bottom line is I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a coffee maker that grinds the beans!!

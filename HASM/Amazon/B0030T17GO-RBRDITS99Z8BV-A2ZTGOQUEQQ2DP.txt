Title: @ days ...New Hard Drive being sent...
Content:
Just received my new 17.3 Inspiron I ordered from QVC. Although the Windows and Internet worked, the facial recognition security program and webcam didn't. Dell tried, for about three hours this morning to remote access repair the problem, with no success. So they are sending a new hard drive for my install. Just what you like to do when you get a new computer! The above comment about quality control in China seems to be correct. Anyway, I'll see how it goes when I get the HD but I'll probably return the computer within the 30 day policy QVC has on their purchases. Thank god for that!

Title: Looks cool, but crap!
Content:
This IPOD looks really cool, I actually like the cover flow, and the colors are awesome. However, I had mine for 3 days and it has already broken. It doesn't charge on any of the old accessories, which makes this 8 gb for $149.99 not seem like such a great deal (if you are going to have to get a new stereo system and car charger). I also thought that the "Genius" would be a really cool feature, too bad that none of my songs are available through the "Genius." PSH, what a crock.   If I get my new one and it doesn't break, I will rate higher, but I thought Apple was so far above any of the other MP3 players that I wouldn't have to worry about something so stupid. They just don't make 'em like they used to!

Title: great product
Content:
Before this pmp, I've owned 5 other media players, and I have to say, this one has worked the best so far.  At first, I was afraid to buy a hard-disk based mp3 player because of the life of the things, but it is the cheapest way to get that much space for all of your videos, photos, music, etc.  Also, this is one of about 3 companies that offers a reliable warranty, so I don't worry about anything happening to it.  The only thing I would complain about is the price, since apple can charge anything they want to for having such a popular set of pmps.  If you want the same functionality with a little less quality and a much lower price, you should go and check out the sandisk sansas.  I was very happy with the two sansas that I owned, and the only reason I now bought an ipod was for the space.

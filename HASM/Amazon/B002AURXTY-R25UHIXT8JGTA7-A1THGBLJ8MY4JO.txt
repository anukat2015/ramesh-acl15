Title: Link to Windows 7 Upgrade offer
Content:
Here is the link to the Windows 7 Upgrade offer on Acer's website.  You have to have purchased the system between June 2009 and January 2010, as I recall.  The registration process is a bit tedious.  Right now, it says you have until January 2010 to request the upgrade, and it will be shipped on a first come first served basis. I've had the computer for about a month. I like though I'm not getting anywhere near the 8 hours battery life advertised.  Perhaps I don't have all the power saving features deployed.  I haven't changed any settings since I took it out of the box.  The screen is great and I don't find the mouse buttons hard to operate (which was a complaint of many).  One of the plastic caps covering the hinge on the left side popped off because I was probably trying to open the screen too far, but it didn't give me the best feeling about long-term durability.  We'll see--I've had nothing but IBM thinkpads for years and last year bought a Lenovo netbook.

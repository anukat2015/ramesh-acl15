Title: ...more like coffee shower for your countertop
Content:
Add one more to the list of customers who have serious issues with the design of this product. Unless you enjoy drinking your morning coffee out of a juice glass, Dixie cup, or something with a similarly thin rim, you can expect to have a serious pool of coffee on whatever surface this thing sits on as soon as you start dispensin'. And if you are the on-the-go type who enjoys coffee out of a travel mug? Bwaaaahahaha: forget it. A shame, really, because in every other respect this is a pretty nice unit. 
If you are like me (God help you), you may be inclined to read all these reviews and say "Sounds bad, but I'm sure we can work around this issue." Trust me, you can't. The design problems with this product are serious enough that my wife and I are willing to eat the cost of this thing and replace it--and we ain't the Rockefellers.

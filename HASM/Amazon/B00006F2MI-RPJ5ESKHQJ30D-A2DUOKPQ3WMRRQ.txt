Title: Good machine, great coffee
Content:
The reviews on here are hilarious.  "Oh my gosh, I actually have to clean this thing!"
This machine makes great coffee, plain and simple, and combines all the steps to making good coffee into about as simple a process as you can ask for.
Some on here seem to expect this machine to harvest and ship the beans, process them, silently add and grind them without leaving any residue, add and filter the water from springs deep below the earth, dispose of the grinds in their compost pile, clean itself, and bring refills to them when they're ready.
If you want a great cup of coffee off a timer and realistically expect to have to clean up AND maintain the machine, give this one a try.
If you want great coffee without being hassled by actually having to do something yourself, go to Starbucks.
4 stars only because it doesn't do a great job on small batches, when I only need a cup or two.  Adequate, but not as good as full pot.  If you're the only coffee drinker in the house, you might do better trying something else.

Title: What a gem!
Content:
I was unsure as to whether I could enjoy a matte display, so I compared the glossy and matte screens side by side at an Apple retail store.  While the glossy display was rich in color, I found the glare of the overhead lights and reflection of the activity behind me very distracting and annoying.  I then began to play with the color options on the matte screen Macbook Pro and was able to nearly duplicate the saturation of color.  FYI--Apple has recently redesigned the 17" MacBook Pro with the same glossy display as its siblings, however, you can "upgrade" to a matte display for an additional $50.  Imagine that!  
This Macbook Pro is a gem.

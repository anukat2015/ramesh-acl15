Title: Completely Satisfied
Content:
The Canon 50D is great. I added the Tamron AF18-270mmm F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC LD Aspherical [IF} Macro (Model Bo003) lens from Amazon to this camera and I am extremely satisfied with their performance together.  The quality of my pictures with the new camera and len are significant.  I was using a Canon Rebel Xt with a Tamron 18-200 lens.

Title: Great little vac
Content:
This is a great little/light vacuum.  It is especially good for hard surfaces.  I live in a four story house and being able to carry the vac on my shoulder from floor to floor really speeds up the job.  The extra long cord allows me to do a whole floor with just one plug change.  It's suction power has handled everything encountered so far (from dust to kitty litter) and I can do all four floors before having to empty the filter, which is very easy to do.

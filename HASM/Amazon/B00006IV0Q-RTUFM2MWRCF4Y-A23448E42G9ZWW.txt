Title: Will Never Go Back To Drip Coffee!!!
Content:
I had purchased an expensive drip coffee maker last year (over $100). I cleaned it regularly, but within about 15 mos. it began to leak! Every drip coffee maker I have owned, (and I have owned quite a few, different brands) I have had problems with. The coffee was never hot enough, and never tasted all that great. I have had this Presto perculator for about 8 months. I absolutely love it! I had forgotten what "real" coffee tasted like. The coffee is nice and hot, and full bodied like it should be. And of course the gentle "swooshing" sound it makes while perking, just takes me back to my childhood.  Trust me, if you buy this perculator, you too will never go back to a drip!!!

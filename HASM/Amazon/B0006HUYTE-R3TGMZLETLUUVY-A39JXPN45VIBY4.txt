Title: loud and full of vacuum
Content:
i had the ordinary version of this, in fact two previous models - each had a problem with the power switch - which is replaceable by the way, if you are even slightly mechanically inclined - and the switch can be found at any hdwr store - just get the correct power/amps rating- otherwise the cord is a little longer and heavier duty, the inlet hose is heavier duty, the metal-wand, telescopic, is a good idea, but a little heavy, but you can use your old plastic tubes instead. Get the Hepa filter accessory, get earmuffs, but a good machine overall - do it when there's something else going on you don't want to hear - or if you live in am apt -to annoy the neighbors!- and it comes with a shoulder strap, which is great for almost all uses, and the machine doesn't weigh much
I'm happy with it, and have never figured why people use uprights -now those are useless! This machine is likely well worth the extra cost, which isn't that much more. It really sucks - i mean whoosh and the dirt runs to it

Title: Like a German sports car...
Content:
This is a great piece of quality craftsmanship and engineering.  It is a joy to use.  Everything is simple and intuitive, from the suction control to the silky smooth swiveling attachments that allow you to pilot your way under any piece of furniture with ease.  The power is great, but I do agree with T. Bullard that you should do your homework before buying one.  The turbo brush is great for my low pile carpet, but I don't know how it would perform on thicker rugs.
Highly recommended.

Title: The worst!
Content:
Bought the laptop 8-2009.  From the onset the loud fan was distracting. Constant dropped connections via the Wi-fi was frustrating. Battery life is less than two hours.  The hard-drive failed yesterday-- fortunately covered under-warranty.  2 cheap Acer laptops and an HP laptop in our home-- without any issues.  Just bought an HP-- who needs this?

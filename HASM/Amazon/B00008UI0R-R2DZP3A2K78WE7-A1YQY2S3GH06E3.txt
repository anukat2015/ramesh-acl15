Title: vac good customer service stinks
Content:
did not receive the hand held attachment with this vac, so i was told by amazon to contact hoover directly.  i was hung up on over 5 times.  spoke to know one who spoke english with any fluency.  will never buy a hoover again because of their poo.r customer service.  We need to let companys know its not OK to outsource jobs to other countries....it takes jobs away from us and makes doing business witht these companies much harder on us...the consumer.

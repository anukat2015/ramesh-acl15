Title: Pricey but not impressed
Content:
Just having new wood floors installed,Ineed a vacuum that would do both wood floors and carpet. It was an expensive vacuum but I thought it would be worth the price if it could both floors well and last a long time. I bought the antares model. It was $479.  It had good suction,was quiet and light-weight;however, I would have had to purchase the power nozzle for another$249. to do the carpets and the parquet brush to adequately do the wood floors for another $50 dollars. Much too expensive for my taste!!

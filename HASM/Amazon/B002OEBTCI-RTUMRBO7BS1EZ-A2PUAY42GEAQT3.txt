Title: Worth the money
Content:
This camera plus lens package was the best purchase I have made in awhile. It was very worth the money and works great. It also came so much sooner than I was expecting which made me very happy. It said 1-2 months which deterred me from buying; however, since it was a great price for the body of the camera and 2 lenses, I had to buy it and just wait patiently. Fortunately, it came in about 2-3 weeks. I was a little wary about buying a camera of this quality online, not knowing if I could trust the online seller and shipping etc., but it was perfect.

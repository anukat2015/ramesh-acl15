Title: Good Switch from an IPod
Content:
I was using an IPod touch before switching to the Zune. I'm glad I made the switch as the simpler controls make it much more convenient. I only decided to switch after reading many articles on the improvements made with the 3rd generation player and software. The included radio tuner, functionality with Audible, the available subscription service, and an available 8GB flash drive model is what prompted me to finally switch. Perhaps if I were traveling more, the touch would have more functionality, but this is a much more convenient and functional music player for me. The sound quality is excellent combined with the included headset and I was glad to find that it had a progressive fast forward feature for my podcasts and audio books. The display can seem a little dark at times and probably the one featue I would like to see them add would be an easier way to flip thru the tracks of an album as it plays. I'm very happy with this player and I don't miss ITunes in the least. A few of my coworkers, after having seen my new player and heard about the improvements have told me they plan to buy one for themselves soon. 
I really hope to see MS do well with this player as better competition in this market will only be good news for us as consumers. I think what MS has done with this generation Zune is good step forward and I look forward to their version 4 software.

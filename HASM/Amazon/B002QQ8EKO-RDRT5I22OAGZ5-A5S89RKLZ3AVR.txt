Title: As long as you don't have MacBook Pro envy..
Content:
It's great. Lightweight and portable, it's the perfect laptop for the everyday student. That said, most people are running over to the MacBook Pro, so you'll be getting a lot of "Why didn't you upgrade?" questions. My usual response goes along with "I didn't feel like spending an extra $200 when for a backlit keyboard I have a LAMP for that." However, I digress; If you can live without that and an SD slot & firewire then you're set. Buy it!

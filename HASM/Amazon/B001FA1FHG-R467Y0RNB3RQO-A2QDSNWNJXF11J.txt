Title: 2 small problems but otherwise amazing!
Content:
This heater is truly amazing.  The fire looks beautiful and you can dim it so it's not too bright.  It warms up my large bedroom in 15 minutes flat and will get burning hot after an hour.
The crackling noise is kind of annoying but you can set it to mute.
The only downfalls are that you can't set the timer for 3 hours--I wanted the have the heater warming for 1 hour before I goto bed and 2 hours into sleep (3 hours total) but this isn't possible--You can only set it for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours... and the LCD screen is bright blue while everything else is dim red.  That caveats are small and I still love this heater!

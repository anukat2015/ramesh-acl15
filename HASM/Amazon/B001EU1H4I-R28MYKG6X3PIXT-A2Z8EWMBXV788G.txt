Title: Black N Decker Spacemaker Coffeemaker
Content:
I love the looks..  I love the space making aspect...  Installation is rough.  If you are a handy person it's not a big problem.  If you are challenged when it comes to installing things like this.. get a friend to do it because the instructions and template will have you in tears.  
When you are all ready to make the coffee.. water in resevoir and coffee and filter in tact, be careful not to leave it unsupervised after you put the decanter in. When the decanter is empty it isn't heavy enough to hold back the spring thing that lets the coffee flow out.  You have to watch it and help push it in a bit until there is enough coffee in the decanter to weigh it down and keep the spring thing open for coffee flow.  This makes the possibility of programming to make coffee for you upon waking up impossible.
I'm still keeping it because I need the space saving aspect and it does LOOK nice, but I don't recommend it unless you have those same needs.Black & Decker SDC740B SpaceMaker 12-Cup Coffeemaker, Black

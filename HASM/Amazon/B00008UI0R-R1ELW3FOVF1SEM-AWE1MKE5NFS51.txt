Title: Do not buy
Content:
I spent hours and hours researching vacuums, ultimately deciding on this one. This is the first vacuum I have ever owned. I am not terribly pleased with it.
Bagless is just plain dumb. It is incredibly messy to empty. Yea you just flip it upside down in a garbage can, but so much dust gets in the air. And the canister never looks clean like the day you first get it because the dust sticks to it. Even the outside gets covered in a thin film of dust, you would need to use a wet paper towel to wipe it down.
This reason alone makes me want to buy a new vacuum. The whole purpose of a vacuum is to clean. It brags of a hepa filter, but what good does it do when you have a messy method of emptying all the dirt? Yea I suppose its more environmentally friendly because it doesnt use bags, but I think your better off finding a bagged vacuum and dealing with buying bags. Maybe there is a brand out there that makes eco freindly bags. That would be your best bet.
As a vacuum, it does a good job collecting dirt. The controls on the handle are a nice feature. The capet tool works well. As others have said, the attachments are lacking. The bristles on the brush are too stiff to be of any useful cleaning purpose. Hose length is adequate, not amazing, but it gets the job done. Retractable code is nice, works well. No place to store two of the attachments is also dumb, they should have sacrificed some looks and made a home for the other attachments.
I think I will sell this vacuum on ebay and buy a BAGGED version.

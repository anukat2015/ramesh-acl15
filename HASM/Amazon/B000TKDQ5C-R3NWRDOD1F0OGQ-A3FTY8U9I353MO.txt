Title: Nice little heater!
Content:
Works excellent for my intended use. This heater is obviously not something to use to heat any kind of area.  I use it for a personal heater to keep my feet and legs warm.  For that purpose it works great, in fact I have to turn it down after a little while as I get a little too warm.
Only downside is it's a little bit noisy.

Title: Great Vacuum!
Content:
I clean houses for a living and am constantly on a search for the perfect vacuum. While this vacuum will not tackle every job, it handles most. 
 
Using this vacuum to dust furniture and upholstery is great. You can put it on the floor and roll it behind you, pick it up by the handle, or use the shoulder strap. The strap is excellent for cleaning stairs. I love the design of the wand, it feels a lot stronger than my previous oreck. On low pile carpet and area rugs, it does a pretty good job with the attachment it comes with. I purchased a carpet turbo head for mine, and now it does a really good job!
Unfortunately it won't work very effectively on high pile carpet, so don't throw away your upright just yet!
Maintenance for this vacuum is pretty simple. I use it to vacuum the exterior of itself, change bags frequently, wipe out the inside and clean the filter on a regular basis. 
Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this model. All the parts are easy to locate online, which is important. The cord winding is a little annoying, but those retractable cords always seem to break anyway. The one thing I would change it the attachment storage. They are supposed to attach to the wand, but I find if you have the wand under a bed or furniture, you end up knocking the attachment storage off completely.

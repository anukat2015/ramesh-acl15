Title: not for an amateur
Content:
This camera is not recommended for an amateur. It has literally hundreds of settings that only an expert would understand and only someone with a 'photographic memory' will learn. The User Guide is not user-friendly. Panasonic should contract with a good training company to create a User Guide. If I had bought the G1 from our local dealer, I would have returned it. This our third digital camera. The first two were 'point and shoot' (Kodak and Canon) and took beautiful images, but were too slow. We were attracted to the G1 by reviewers who said the first-frame rate was very fast, but we find it not to be so. We'll continue to use our PowerShot A80.

Title: Great replacement for my moms Eureka!
Content:
I purchased the Polaris S4212 Canister to replace my mother's old vacuum.  Her previous vacuum a steel Eureka was at least 30 years old when it gave up the ghost (the motor was making strange sounds).   I read as many reviews on different sites including this one to determine which vacuum was the best and while I was initially put-off my the products high price tag I decided to take the plunge.  I am very glad I did.  This vacuum is more powerful and yet quieter than any vac I have used previously.  On it lowest setting you can clean while someone is sleeping in a different room or even in the same room if they're a sound sleeper.

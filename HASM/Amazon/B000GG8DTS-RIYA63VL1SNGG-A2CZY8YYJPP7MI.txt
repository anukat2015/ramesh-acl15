Title: WORSE THAN JUNK
Content:
Some people have given this heater poor reviews because it's smaller and less powerful than they expected, but I specifically wanted a small energy efficient heater that wouldn't put out too much light, so the Optimus H-4110 looked perfect for me and the price was right.  When I received it I set it up right away and it was PERFECT for my needs for 5 days, and then it crapped out for no apparent reason.
I figured I got a dud, so I ordered a replacement through Amazon.  I received the replacement today and set it up expecting it to be fine.  The replacement stopped working after 6 HOURS!  I know these are inexpensive and I kept my expectations low, but 5 days?  1 day?  It's a junk product, and that's too bad because I'd be willing to pay 3x the price if I actually had confidence it would work for at least a year before breaking for no good reason.
Don't waste your money and time on this heater, shell out the money for a better quality one.  I suggest the Soleus stuff, I recently got a 400w Soleus parabolic heater too, it's bigger and puts out a bit too much light for my taste, but it's better in every other capacity and seems like it might actually last more than a few days.  (And no, Soleus isn't paying me to hawk their products or anything, I'm sure there are other good brands-  I just don't want anyone else to waste their money on this junky Optimus heater.)

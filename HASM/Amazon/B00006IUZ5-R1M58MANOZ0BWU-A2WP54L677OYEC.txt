Title: Item received not item advertised
Content:
The item listed, pictured on the page and that I ordered was a Sunbeam Hot Shot 3211.  The item received was a Sunbeam Hot Shot 6170, which was far too large to fit in my counter space.  I returned the item in accordance with the instructions included in the packaging.  Brand Variety did not refund return shipping on this item.  Amazon.com finally made things right with me by issuing an Amazon merchandise credit.

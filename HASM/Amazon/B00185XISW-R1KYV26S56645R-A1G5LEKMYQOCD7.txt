Title: Great fit for my needs
Content:
This heater has been working great for me from the start.  I needed a relatively small heater to keep a 150 sq ft room warm while still being pet friendly (won't burn anyone or outgas bird toxic fumes).  So far I couldn't be much happier.  This heater does take a few minutes to come up to temperature so that it can begin heating the room, and it also does take a bit longer, once warm, to heat the entire room compared to other space heaters its size.  However the fact that the Eco-heater draws much less power, fits my pet requirements, and it is more space efficient (as it attaches to the wall) outweigh the few extra minutes I have to wait to be warm.  Even that can be cheaply addressed if you buy a programmable outlet thermostat.

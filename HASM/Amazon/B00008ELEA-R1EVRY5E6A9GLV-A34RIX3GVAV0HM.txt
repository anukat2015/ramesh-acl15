Title: Simply the Best!
Content:
Have had the identical Farberware perculator in 2-4 cup size for about two years and just love it.  When having guests, we needed something larger, so we purchased the 8-cup. Never considered any other coffeemaker after using the Farberware.  Makes a wonderful cup of coffee FAST!  We use paper filters in the basket just to make cleanup easier.   Can use regular filters and just snip a whole in the center - works great.  Coffee stains built up on the inside and basket after about a year, but Greased Lightning made it look new again (do not use on outside of pot).

Title: Back to the drawing board
Content:
I've been using Krups coffeemakers for over 20 years, this being the fourth I've purchased.  It may also be the last.  
Programming the device is moderately frustrating, with less than clear directions.  The water gauge is badly placed and too narrow - bubbles form in the gauge making it useless as a measure.  The attached lid on the carafe makes it harder to clean.  That it took three weeks of use before the smell of new, wet plastic infusing the coffee subsided also makes me wonder what has happened to the quality I'd come to expect.
Krups seems to have decided to let appearance trump function, resulting in a machine that looks better than it works.  Unlike its predecessors, I expect I'll be replacing this machine before it quits working.

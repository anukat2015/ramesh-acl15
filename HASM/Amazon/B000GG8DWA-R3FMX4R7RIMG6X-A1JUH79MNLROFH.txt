Title: its good but...
Content:
Item arrived sooner than promised. it works well for a small room. it also sucks power like crazy. so you have to weigh in the cost of using this(electricity bill) against turning up the heat(gas bill). you will need to find a sweet spot between those two and probably limit the usage accordingly.

Title: Just what I wanted
Content:
In the relatively short time I have had this item it has served me very well.  The pointed suction end is what I was seeking to help cleaning out my Roomba robot vacuum after use.  It has come in handy on other occasions, too, and the power holds up well. I have other small vacs with cords, and it is ultra convenient to have this cordless type.

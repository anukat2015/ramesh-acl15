Title: Great coffee but grounds in the bottom
Content:
This coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee.  However, it leave grounds in the bottom of your cup!  Not big on that if you are a bottom feeder! However, like I said makes a great cup of coffee and worth the money!  You have people over?  Cover's enough coffee to feed 4 with a secomd cup each!  It is truly a good cup if you buy great coffee!  You need to like it strong and long!  It's great!  Only problem is that the second cup CAN (on occassion) have that burnt taste.  I still love it and will make percolated coffee every DAY!

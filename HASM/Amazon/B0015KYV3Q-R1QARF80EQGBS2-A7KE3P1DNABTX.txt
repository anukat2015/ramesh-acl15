Title: Best MP3 player on the market
Content:
If you are like me and don't want to be told to use Itune or any other proprietary software to download music into your MP3 player, the Fuze is for you. What sold me other than the sd card memory extension and the great sound quality, is the drag and click ease to add music to the Fuze memory. Finally an MP3 player that's simple to use.

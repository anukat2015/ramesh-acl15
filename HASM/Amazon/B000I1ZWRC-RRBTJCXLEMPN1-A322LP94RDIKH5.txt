Title: Creative freedom, beautiful pics
Content:
If you have had digital PS cameras, you know they take good pics of average scenes, but sometimes they try to be too smart and get in the way of what you really want to achieve. If you are familiar with 35mm SLRs, you really miss the ability to control things. 
The new generation of DSLRs are now as good as 35mm for enlargements, and modern storage media (flash cards and hard disks) allow for storage of a lot of images even at maximum size and quality. The Canon is the best value of a very good set of contenders from Nikon and Sony. The sensor in the camera is 24 mm (larger is better -- we will soon see a 35 mm sensor). This camera can use legacy Canon lenses as well as the new EFS (short focus in the back specifically for digital EOS). Because the sensor is not 35mm, you have to multiply lens length by a conversion factor, in this case 1.6, to get 35 mm equivalent (example: a 50mm lens will give the same result as an 80mm on a 35 SLR).
The kit lens is ok but not great. I got a Tamron 28-75 f2.8 which is my primary lens. I may splurge and get one of the Canon "L" series lenses in the near future.
The camera is compatible with iPhoto on the Mac (I have yet to encounter one that is not), and comes with its own image browser and photo editing software. On the Mac, I am using the Canon image browser and iPhoto for picture management, but still prefer Photoshop elements when I need more image manipulation. iPhoto albums are effectively folders that can be loaded into the navigation window of Image Browser.
July update: I have just gone over 4000 shots, flawless performance.

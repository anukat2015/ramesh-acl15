Title: SPACE HEATER SURFER
Content:
THIS BABY IS A REAL HEAT PUMPER. APTLY NAMED THE DRAGON IT IS MOST SUITABLE FOR BEDROOMS. MINE IS AROUND 300 SQ FEET AND IS VERY COZY EVEN AT 6 DEGREES OUTSIDE. BEST FEATURE IS THE THERMOSTAT DIAL CAN BE ON CONTINUOUS USE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CONTROL FEATURE WHICH REGULATES THE WATTS USED WHEN YOU REACH THE DESIRED TEMPERATURE. THUS MAXIMUM HEAT WITH MINIMUM DOLLARS. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LARGER SPACES. I TRIED IT IN THE LIVING ROOM WITH LESS EFFECT.

Title: Great camera overall--can't go wrong with it!
Content:
Hi,
I got this camera in the mail recently and all I can say is that I'm utterly impressed. Don't listen to those pro/photosnubs who lambast this very powerful camera. Don't feel envy or inferior than this camera's "bigger" sister (the D20) because it offers, by far, pretty much the same specs. This camera feels solid, very easy to handle and get around of. The plethora of Canon lenses you can attach to this camera is big enough to let your imagination do its work (limited only by the depth of your pockets).
*Image quality is bar-none.
*Noise @ relatively high ISOs (400-800) is negligible.
*Battery life is decent (buy an additional battery).
*The auto focus is blazing fast (with canon lenses).
*Start-up time is unreal!
*Menus and configuration settings of the camera are well thought-out and designed.
*Very versatile; in fact, extremelly versatile. Just as it can work for those new to SLRs, it can work for advanced amateurs and semi-pro photographers as well.
Things you need to (must) do and buy to make the most of this camera:
* Ditch the kit lens...leave it as a "just-in-case-of-doomsday" lens.
* Buy at least 2 more lenses one for wide-angle shots and one tele-foto (zoom). I recommend buying Canon's as they perform the best with their cameras (though if you're on a tight budget, you can get Sigma's).
* Tripod.
* External Flash (if you plan to use it in less-than-ideal light conditions).
* Carrying case.
* Filters.
* Insurance!!!
Yes, I know that buying all of the above will set you back $1700-2K (camera inclusive), but in this field is more true than anywhere else, "you get what you pay for."
If your hands are big and don't feel very comfortable with this camera, you might then try a D20 (or buy the external battery grip for the Rebebel XT).
In short, very good camera, good price, good upgrade options, and reliable service from Canon. The best value in the DSLR market today--period!

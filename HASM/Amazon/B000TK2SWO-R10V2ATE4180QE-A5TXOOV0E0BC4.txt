Title: Third time's the charm
Content:
The first unit I received had a defective connection to the thermostatic switch that caused it to fail in about 10 days.  The second unit arrived with a deformed fan mounting bracket that prevented the fan blades from moving at all.
My electrician took the switch from the second unit and wired it into the first unit, creating a Frankenstein heater that is currently working well. The costs of the electrician doubled the total outlay to get a working unit.  Verdict: poor quality control.  The only really positive part of the experience was that the vendor, RedeemAir, was extremely responsive -- I actually had the second unit in hand within 36 hours of reporting the initial problem.  Kudos to RedeemAir.

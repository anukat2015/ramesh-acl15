Title: Awesome laptop for its price!
Content:
I bought this laptop off of eBay new in factory sealed box. I got it for about $750, which is a heck of a deal. Opened it up and everything booted fine. In a few seconds, I had it up and running XP Home. This laptop has 512MB DDR (64MB DDR shared video memory) and a 40GB hard drive, which are practically top of the line. 512MB DDR is going to make XP run very fast. This laptop is actually faster than my desktop PC which has a XP 2000+/256MB DDR. The 14.1&quot; XGA display is gorgeous. It is crisp and very easy on the eyes, plus it has beautiful colors. It may not be a 15&quot;, but being smaller, it will save on your battery life. Performance is awesome, the CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive is sweet, battery life is great, and everything is awesome! This laptop is great for you road warriors, since it gets around 3 hours (for real) of battery life, runs very cool, and is rather compact and thin. Everything works great! The Athlon XP-M processor is also going to save you battery life and heat over the Pentium 4-M. AMD has PowerNow! technology, which automatically controls the processor speed in relation to its usage. It can adjust the speed from ~500mhz-1.53ghz. Intel's SpeedStep technology can only operate at two speeds: full-conk and too slow. The XP-M also runs much more cooler than the P4-M. If you notice, the P4-M Presario laptops are much thicker than the XP-M ones. This is due to the P4-M's requirement for extra cooling, which means more heat and more noise. The graphics are ATi IGP320M, which uses the mobility Radeon 7000. It can use up to 128MB DDR shared memory, but 64MB is standard. The graphics are excellent for DX8/DX8.1 gaming (GeForce2 MX performance level), and run every game I have tried so far. The drivers are awesome, and I have not come across any incompatibilities. I even use this laptop for AutoCAD 2004 and 3D Studio Max R5, which are very intensive design programs, and it breezes through all of the applications. The exterior of the laptop is also pretty hardy. The plastic seems tough enough for heavy use, and everything is built sturdily. This thing is built like a tank, and it looks very, very cool. Also, Compaq tech support is excellent, and I have not had any trouble contacting them or finding solutions to problems. They are very knowledgeable and professional in their work. Excellent people I may say! Compaq made an excellent notebook that balances price, mobility, and performance all in one. If you are considering the Compaq Presario 2100 AMD Athlon XP-M laptop, go for it.

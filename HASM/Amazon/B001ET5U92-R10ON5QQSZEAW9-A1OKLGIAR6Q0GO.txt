Title: Nikon D90 Best sub $1,000 DSLR
Content:
I am a professional Wedding Photographer in New Jersey where I use the Nikon D3 pro camera.  The Nikon D90 is my second camera. It has replaced the D200 and D2X as the second camera.  I considered the D300, comparing the D300 to the D90.  I chose the D90 for several reason.  The internal processor of the D90 and D300 is just about the same, 99% of the people would not know the difference.  The D300 may be faster and have more metal, but I was going for a lighter ( weight) camera that I can carry all day.  The D90 has become just that. During weddings, the D3 is on a flash bracket and the D90 is probably around my neck.  The quality of the photos is almost the same, the D3 having a better response to low light.  The D90 blows away the D200 and D2X for low light however which is why it has replaced these two.  The D90 has also become my everyday camera and my travel camera.  In my travel bag are several lens however as the carry around lens, the 18 - 200.  While the 18-200mm lens may not be the sharpest lens in the Nikon line up, it is certainly the most useful when you can only have one lens.  I usually shoot RAW + JEG with 8GB cards and the ASUS 1201N netbook for backup of the SD cards.  The limitations: 1) Not a good sport camera such as shooting soccer games - much better than a P&S but not as good as the D3. 2) Not a good cold weather camera - electronics don't work very well when the camera is below freezing in temperature, need to keep the camera warmer.  3) Not weather sealed like the D300 or D3 - need to keep it dry and away from severe dusty areas.

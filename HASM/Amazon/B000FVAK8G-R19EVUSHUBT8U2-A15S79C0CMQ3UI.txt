Title: It is trash, and tough to recycle.
Content:
I bought two heaters two winters ago and both would turn themselves off after a few seconds.  I called KAZ, the manufacturer for Honeywell.  They had me cut off the power cord and the casters and mail them in for two replacements.  I don't know if they would have sent the replacements but for the two follow up calls.  All told, it took about two months to get the replacements.  At that point, winter was largely over.  The replacments were this newer model.  One works great, but the other fails exactly as the older model did, by switch off as soon as the room temperature registers.  So out of three heaters, one worked.  That's a 25% function rate.  I decided I would rather wear a wool cap to bed than try again to get a functioning heater from this company.

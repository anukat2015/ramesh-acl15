Title: Back to the old SLR days
Content:
I bought this camera after using a Olympus SP 500UZ which I liked very much. I did have problems getting focused zoom pictures and, since my eyes are not the youngest anymore, the preview screen is hard to see, especially in bright light. Well, here comes through the Lens viewing and I am happy as a lark. Makes me wonder why I gave up the 35mm Camera! I love the Image Stabilizer and the many shortcut functions. Two things that are minor is the function button which is right there where you grab the camera and it gets pushed by accident. The other is the manual which could be laid out differntly but this is minor since every new car comes nowadays with a 3 inch book. All in all I am very happy with this Product.

Title: Great Camera
Content:
Great camera. I won't go into all the specs or usage there are plenty of reviews out there to read. I will just say that from my experience as a 1st time DSLR user this has been a great camera, easy to use and the pictures look great (even my photographer friends have mentioned how good the images look). It's worth it to get the 2 lens kit if it is close in price to the 1 lens kit which it usually is.  Another great thing about this camera is a lot of the features like antishake and some of the autofocusing features are built into the camera body as opposed to the lens like some other DSLRS, this combined with the universal K-mount means that it is really easy to find great old lens on ebay that will work perfectly with this camera. I got a very nice older 50mm Pentax prime lens for $20 on ebay, just popped it on and it worked seamlessly. Nice.

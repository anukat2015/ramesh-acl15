Title: Almost perfect, if you get the firewire cable! USB Stinky!
Content:
PRO: I REALLY like the iPod. 30gb is just about the right size, few thousand songs, few thousand pics, and I'm barely half full. NICE! Works great, plugs right into the Dash on my Honda Element, and plays through the car stereo. Also was able to plug it right into the Alpine in the Honda Civic with a $20.00 Alpine adapter. SWEET! The interface is smooth and intuitive.
CON: The USB function did NOT work. I take that back, it did work. ONCE. then each time after that, my pc and Itunes would not recognize my iPod. I had to reformat, reinstall, and start the whole thing over again. After 3 times of this, (and 2 days of frustration) I bought a firewire iPod cable as a last resort. BINGO! Problem solved. No further issues. Many many reviewers have written this same thing on other sites. 
BOTTOM LINE: Love the 30gb iPod, I take it everywhere. Highly recommended. HOWEVER, save yourself some serious headaches, and just spend the bucks on a firewire cable (and card if your comp. doesn't have a firewire port) I would have given 5 stars if I didn't have the USB problem. The iPod itself is a 5 star.

Title: Absolutely stunning
Content:
I am an advanced amature. For me, the quality of professionally done prints is the biggest measure of a camera or lense. I will be brief and to the point:
1. Do not use the kit lense. This camera deserves high quality lenses. If tight on budget, buy the 50mm 1.8 EF MK II. It is a cheap but very high quality lense. This is the lense I use with my XTi.
2. I just received my first set of prints (4x6). I have never taken pictures as good as this. My previous gear was Rebel (film) and the same 50mm lense. So, I can make a decent comparison between 35mm film and digital. The prints from XTi are stunningly better than anything I ever managed with film. The sharpness and perception of depth in the prints are nothing short of dazzling.
3. Do not worry too much about how the pictures look on screen. XTi produces very high fidelity colors which may look a bit dull on the monitor. Your natural tendency might be to tweak the images to increase the color saturation. Do not do it (unless you wish to display the images on screen only). Prints are absolutely stunning in color accuracy and more vivid than screen.
If you are waiting for digital to catch up with film, do not wait any longer. The battle between 35mm and digital is over. Having said that, incredible things are still coming down the technology pipe. If you are really serious, you may want to wait for these:
    - Built in High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography. 
    - Resolution that matches medium format film (15mp).
    - More affordable image stabilization. This may not have been important for 35mm films, but will make a difference at such high resolutions.

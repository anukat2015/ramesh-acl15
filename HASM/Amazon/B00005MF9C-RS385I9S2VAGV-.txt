Title: Has a mind of it's own!
Content:
I received this coffeemaker as a gift. I constantly drink herbal tea and thought it would come in handy with the loose herbs. It works great due to the built in filter. The problem that I have with this product is that if I do not unplug it as soon as it is done, it will reset and try to run another cycle without any water in it. The first time this happened, I noticed a burning smell, like plastic. I think that this product is dangerous and I cannot turn it on and get in the shower in the morning for fear that it will burn my house down.

I've been using my new Sony Vaio for about a month. it is such a beautiful laptop, I'm very pleased with it. I bought 2 external Logiteck speakers that work on USB power only in order to get better sound, the sound could be a bit better This laptop is such a major improvement. Better than other brands such as Toshiba, HP and Acer.I'm really happy that I bought this wonderful vaio. GO FOR IT, you will never regret it.

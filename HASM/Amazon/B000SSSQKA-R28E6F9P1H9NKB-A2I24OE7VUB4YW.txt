Title: BEST VACUUM EVER!!!!!
Content:
I am in a wheelchair and I got tired of looking at filthy floors.  We have an upright vacuum which is impossible for me to use, and my husband wouldn't use it, so I searched for one I could use.  This is perfect!  It is so lightweight and the suction is great.  I love the fact I can control the amount of suction and with just one adjustment, I can use it in every room, and best of all, the cord is retractable so I never have to worry about the cord getting tangled around my wheelchair!  Give this vac a try -- if I find it easy to use, so will you!

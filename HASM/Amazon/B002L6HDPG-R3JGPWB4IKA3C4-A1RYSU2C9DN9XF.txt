Title: Want Music? Movies? Well I Know What You Need.
Content:
After purchasing this item at around 6:00 P.M. on a Thursday it was hard to sleep because of the anticipation for waiting to get the Ipod. Thinking it would come on Saturday or Monday, it was surprisingly at my door when I came home Friday. One day shipping!
Now for the actual Ipod itself, it is excellent. It was fully charged when I took it out from its package so I looked through all of the different things it had already installed. Games, a pedometer, an alarm clock, and so on. The size of this Ipod is very good for travel and is very light-weight. The battery lasts for quite some time - I watched two movies(2 hours 45 min long each), listened to a couple of songs, and it was just about to run out of power. And if you ever get stuck in traffic, just get it out and listen to the radio or some imported songs off of Itunes. I have already used it for about one month now and there have been no problems at all. I dropped it a couple of times, but nothing cracked, there aren't even scratches on it.
Well worth the price.

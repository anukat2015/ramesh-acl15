Title: good suction, not so easy to use
Content:
The vacuum works great, but changing from one tool to another is difficult and a little painful.  You have to press in a tiny little metal button and turn the tube to remove the vacuum head and use another tool attachment. Not quick or easy.  Other than that, the vacuum emits a slightly oily odor still(3 weeks later) that my husband says will go away soon. Waiting to not smell it.

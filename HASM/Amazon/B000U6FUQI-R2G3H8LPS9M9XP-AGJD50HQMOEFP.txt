Title: fun little floor vaccum
Content:
I purchased this item for my mother for christmas...she needed a lttle vacuum to replace the one she had in her kitchen, which she used every day.  She was a little apprehensive at first because she thought it looked too expensive and it was 'taller' than her last one.  But, only after a few trips around the kitchen I can could tell she was diggin it! She said "oohh, this is fun!" 
The vacuum glides effortlessly on hard surfaces and works pretty good on surface rugs, also. They have three cats and two toddlers running through the house, and it gets rid of all that cat hair and crumbs.  All in all I think I made her pretty happy.

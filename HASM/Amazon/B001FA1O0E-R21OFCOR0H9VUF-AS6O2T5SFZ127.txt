Title: Great Value, Great Price
Content:
I purchased the Itouch for my 16 year old and he absolutely loves it.  I mean this little gadget does everything.  He can surf the web, download music, videos, pics,games, and Instant message downloads.  There is even an application online to purchase minutes to use the itouch as a cellphone.  The 2gb seems to be plenty enough memory for him.  I highly recommend this product.

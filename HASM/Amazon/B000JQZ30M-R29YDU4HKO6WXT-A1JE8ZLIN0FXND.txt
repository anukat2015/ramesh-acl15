Title: Just what I needed
Content:
This is great heater, best used for small spaces. Even in larger rooms, I position the heater to warm small spaces - 8x8. I like the oscillation function also. I normally use this in areas where there are drafty spaces. After using it, I gave one to my son for his apartment and recommended it to friends. In fact, I'm going to buy a second one for my cabin upstate New York where temperatures often are below 0 in the winter.

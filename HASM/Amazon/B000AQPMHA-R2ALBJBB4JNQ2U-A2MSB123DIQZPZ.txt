Title: Not worth the cost!
Content:
I received this coffee maker as a gift at Christmas 08.  It was great at first.  The coffee had a great, fresh taste and hot.  After several cleanings, going by the instructions provided, the coffee doesn't taste good.  It is also colder.  Most of the time, I have to heated it up in the microwave.  Then, the cost of the coffee.  It is so expensive for a big coffee drinker.  It is not worth it!
I bought a 4-cup Mr. Coffeemaker to save on cost.  I enjoy it alot better then the Keurig Elite single-cup.

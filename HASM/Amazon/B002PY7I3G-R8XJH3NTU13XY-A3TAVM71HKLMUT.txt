Title: Waste of money and time.
Content:
I purchased this product in August of 2009. Until this December it worked beautifully. Soon after, the screen started to wig out and we eventually had to send it in to Gateway. Needless to say, I have had to send it in 3 times now because every time it comes back, it is not fixed. It wont even turn on anymore. Do not buy this computer!!

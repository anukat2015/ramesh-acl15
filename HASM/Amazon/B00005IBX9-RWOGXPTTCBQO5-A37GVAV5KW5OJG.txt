Title: Tasty coffee AND a pretty face  (but not perfect)
Content:
Great coffee maker--consistent, reliable, durable, attractive.  The timer is easy to use.  I like the gold filter and don't have any problems cleaning it.
There are only two small design aspects that could be improved.  First, the water reservoir is small and somewhat difficult to access without spilling.  Second, the lid on the pot doesn't flip up, but has to be removed entirely.  This is a bit of a hassle for cleaning.
Other than these features, I think the Cuisinart DCC-1200 is just about perfect, and I'd buy it again without hesitation.

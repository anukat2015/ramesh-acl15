Title: Husband says best coffee ever ...
Content:
We really enjoy this coffeemaker.  It's very light - I think its because it does not have a heater plate.  Instead the coffee drips into a stainless steel pot.  This is good because the coffee doesn't continue to "cook" and also the machine turns off after the coffee is made.
While I like this feature - I also don't like it.  I have to remember to look and pour out yesterday's coffee or ... well you can guess what happens.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
My computer crashed the first day I got it.  It gets really hot, fast.  I don't see that happening with the Dell or the HP laptops in this house. 
I must agree with one reviewer who mentioned that Vista seems incompatable with this computer.  I removed the heavy power draining virus program it came with and purchased ESET Node 32 which is a light fast and effective virus protection.  I also purchased and installed RegCure registry cleaner seems to help,  but still this is a troublesome product I would not buy again.  For about the same price my daughter got a stay cool HP with built in video camera. The 17" would be nice if the computer didn't require an inconvenient cooling pad.

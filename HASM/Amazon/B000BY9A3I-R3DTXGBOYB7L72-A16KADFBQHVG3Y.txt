Title: Bad design.
Content:
The first time this vacuum cleaner was used it shut down after five minutes operation.  The manual states that the vacuum cleaner shuts down when overheated and the "thermal protector" will be activated. If this occurs one must wait 30 or 45 minutes (depending on what section of the manual you read)  to restart the machine. It is difficult to clean a house when the unit refuses to operate 90% of the time. When we did restart the "dirt devil" this devilish machine shut down the circuit breaker in this part of the house. I must assume the engineering of this product is severely flawed. I would not recommend this product to anyone. We cannot review the cleaning abilities of the Dirt Devil since we were able to use it minimally.

Title: Perky little coffee maker
Content:
After reading the instructions, I assembled my coffee percolator and plugged it in. I found the enclosed filters a bit confusing so I thought I'd try it without them. It made a nice strong cup of coffee with some residue at the bottom of the pot, which I think would be remedied by using a filter or a coarser grind of coffee.

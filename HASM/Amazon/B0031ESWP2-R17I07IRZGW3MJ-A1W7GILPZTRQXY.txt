Title: Got screwed with HP-  dont buy an HP LAPTOP
Content:
I purchased two different computers with HP and both times, the screen went in about 1 1/2 years and was not covered under warranty..   It was not cost effective to have the screen replaced.   Do not buy an HP computer that is a lap top.   the pc's are fine and the software and software backup are friendly though.

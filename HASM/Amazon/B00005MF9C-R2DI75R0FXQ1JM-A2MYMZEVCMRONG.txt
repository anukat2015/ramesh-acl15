Title: Coffee for Two
Content:
I had an older version of this coffee maker that I loved--but after 12 years it finally needed replacing.  Originally I bought a fancier replacement that would make two cups at a time (since both my spouse and I are coffee drinkers).  Unfortunately, the fancier coffee maker we made was awful.  It made a mess every other time we used it--I had to babysit it to get it to work.  After a few days I chucked the $50 coffee maker I'd purchased and got 2 of these instead.  Works great and I've never had the mess I did with the fancier version.
The only problem I have is that I'm not terribly fond of the job done by permanent filters--and No. 1 filters are sometimes hard to find.  But the same was true of the older version I had of this (same brand).  My solution is to order a case of No. 1 filters online.

Title: Clean floors!
Content:
I just bought my Shark Roadster and it worked great!  We have two long haired cats and it seemed every time I would sweep, there would be more hair so I wanted a vacuum instead.  I was hoping that by going with a lower priced vacuum, as opposed to some of the larger name brand models, I would not be wasting my time and money.  The Roadster sucked up every hair and hair-ball and all the dirt on the floor.  I was amazed at the suction power this little machine has!  It does have a pretty short cord, but just throw on an extension cord and you're good to go!

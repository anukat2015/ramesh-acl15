Title: Dissapointed with SONY
Content:
I took this laptop from Amazon. It arrived in less than a week. The battery life is lousy. It does not last more than 2 hours at all. I called the Sony guy, he told me not to use dvd, music player, camera, play games, watch movies or open too many windows at a time, and to restore all the settings to default. I told him I haven't changed any settings and why the hell did I buy it for then if I am not supposed to use all of those things?? Still i tried to minimize the windows open and did not run more than 2 things but still the damn thing gave me just 2 hours of battery life. Also another problem this machine has, is it keeps disconnecting from wi fi every 15 min. No one else using the same router has this problem.
The laptop does look good and is fast but I am returning it to Amazon.

Title: Bunn Coffee Maker
Content:
This makes good coffee, so that is not an issue.  What I don't like is the secondary water tank.  You have two choices to make coffee, either leave the coffee maker plugged in and very hot water continuously (uses electricity constantly), or plug in when you're ready to make coffee, and wait about 20 minutes for the water to heat up.  To me this is too much of a hassle.  If I would have understood that I'd probably have picked a different coffee maker.

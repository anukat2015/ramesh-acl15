Title: Works Good, No Problems, A Bit Bulky...
Content:
This coffee maker was a replacement for a "hot plate" model of a diffrent brand. I have been using it for one month now & have no major complaints. I make about 6 cups a day. 4 to bring to work in a thermos and 2 to drink in the morning. It makes an ok cup of coffee. I have used both pre-ground and non pre-ground coffee beans that I grind my self in a Black & Decker coffee grinder. The unit is a big bulky and comes close to hitting the bottom of my cabinets, but the stanless-steel look works well with the other kitchen gadgets on the counter.

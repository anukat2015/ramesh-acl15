Title: Great Coffee, poor manufacturing
Content:
Coffee tastes great, however the machine did start leaking.  Water was all over my counter and floor as well.  You would think that the manufacturer would address this.  Think that there is a possible safety hazard.  Water leaking, coffee maker plugged in electricity... dont know.

Title: Novice photographer's review- great amateur camera
Content:
This a very good amateur camera. With the expert reviews I have read about the other amateur level cameras in the market, this seems to be the best one. The manual modes take a bit of understanding before you want to operate the camera in those modes. But automatic modes are also quite good. The sensor and the lens both are very good. IS works superbly. Very user friendly.
The only disadvantage is that is comes with no in-built memory. 
Also in some of the modes when the sensor senses less light it prompts automatic pop-up of the flash. A few times I tried to put my hand on the flash to prevent the pop-up. In those case the display monitor shows some kind of error and blacks out. I had to turn it off and turn it back again.
But then there is an automatic mode which does not use the flash.
If you are planning to spend the money I would recommend to spend it the best way- buy the XSI. It is worth it.

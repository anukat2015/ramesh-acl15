Title: heater or noisemaker?
Content:
holy crap....  is this a heater or a grade A noise machine (not the good kind)?  just got home with this little devil ($100 lighter) and after reading all of the instructions i plugged it in to begin heating.  well,...it actually seems to be heating just fine, BUT it is making a terrible buzzing noise, the little squeaky kind of buzzing that almost seems like it should only be heard by dogs or something. unfortunately for us, that is not the case.   
i give this an F unless their objective was to put my child in an insane asylum at an early age.
i'll take it back, of course, and we'll be no worse for wear, but don't waste your time as i did.  i read another review mentioning this buzzing and ignored it as it was the only review that did so.  however,  my experience was exactly the same.

Title: Southpaw Loves this coffeemaker
Content:
Now that I have gotten acquainted with this coffeemaker, I really love it! Makes great coffee and looks great in my kitchen.  Four star only because it does not fit under cabinets. I have mine where my bar is so for me that is no problem.
This southpaw has determined that I can pour the water into the reservoir with my right hand.  I hold it with my right hand and steady the pot with my left hand at the front of the pot.  I place the pot lip on top of the right side rim of the coffeemaker where the water goes. This steadies it so I can remove my left hand.  Make sure the lid of the coffeemaker is completely open as this is necessary to pour a full pot of water into the reservoir.  After a few times I find that I no longer have to steady the pot with my left hand. I'm not only left-handed, but have a nervous condition due to medications.
For the folks who seem to be having grounds clogging the reservoir bottom, don't use fine ground coffee in the coffeemaker. If you do, don't make a full pot because that is causing the problem.  Good Luck with getting out the grinds.
For those who don't want all the moisture in the brewing area, remove your basket as well as the grounds after your coffee is completely brewed.  The basket finger handle will not be hot. By removing the basket you are allowing fresh air into the brewing area from the hole in the bottom of the basket holder. This works for me.

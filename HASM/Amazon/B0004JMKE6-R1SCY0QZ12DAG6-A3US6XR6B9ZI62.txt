Title: hard  to  program
Content:
This  is  a  great   buy  and  I  like  the  looks  of  it  on  my  counter.  We  have  one  in  yellow   for  tea also.      I  never  use  the  auto  because  it  is  too  confusing.  The  bells    are  okay  not   bothersome.  No  trouble    with  the  handle  either.  The  yellow  one  does  have  an  extra  band   to  go  around  with  the  handle.

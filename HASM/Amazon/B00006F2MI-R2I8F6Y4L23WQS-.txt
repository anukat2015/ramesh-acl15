Title: it's fine
Content:
While it is a little messy to clean and getting right amount of water is a bit difficult, it is nice to have your whole beans ground in the morning (programmed from the night before) and get a truly delicious cup of coffee. One warning though. For some reason, the door latch to the filter basket broke on my first model, which I sent back. After an eternity I got a new one, but the latch is still not perfect. A shame, because they could have not made it spring action and it would be fine.

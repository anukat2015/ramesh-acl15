Title: These are great
Content:
I bought 2 heaters and two thermostats for a recently redone garage conversion. It was the coldest space in the house. Now it is the warmest. With 2 heaters in a 20X20 space it is perfect. They are painted to match the walls so they are not eye-sores.  They have a guarantee that comes with the product. The heater is easy to hang. Mine did not crack and have not had any issues. If I had had any problems I would have returned it to the manufacturer for a replacement.

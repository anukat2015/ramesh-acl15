Title: Great for a Serious Beginner
Content:
The Canon Rebel XS is an incredibly nice intro for a post-point-and-shoot photographer.  The manual is explained quite well (even managing to simplify the concepts of f-stops and shutter speeds), and the camera itself is clever enough to generally get it right when set to Program (auto) mode.
For a DSLR, the camera isn't overly heavy, and I haven't felt it to be cumbersome in the variety of shooting situations in which I've used it.
The screen is a nice size, and the playbacks seem to mimic the color quality of the RAWs relatively faithfully.
One of my few complaints is with the amount of software provided.  While this may seem a bit silly, the number of programs seems superfluous, as many of the functions of one are echoed in another.  With my first two or three file transfers, I was sometimes confused as to why or whether I needed three of their provided programs open at once just to view my images.
Overall, the Rebel XS is a quality DSLR, and I'd recommend it to anyone starting out in serious photography.

Title: Big bang for a little camera!
Content:
I have a K200d and a Nikon D300 but I have to say that the K200d is pretty much on par with my D300 when given enough light and shot in lower iso ranges. If you don't shoot in dark lighting and don't need extra features of more expensive cameras, you will be very happy with the output from the K200d. Images are very detailed when you put some good glass to it. The Pentax FA 50mm 1.4 can't be touched by the other brands for it's image quality and low price. I've shot pictures with this camera where my iso was set to 100 and camera metered for highlights -- using some software to bring in some fill light showed that the camera retained a lot of dark and shadow detail without a whole lot of noise. Overall, I may shoot with my D300 more because of it's features, but I will never get rid of my K200d because I think it is that good!

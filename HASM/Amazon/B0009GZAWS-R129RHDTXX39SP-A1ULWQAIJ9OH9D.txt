Title: Not as good as expected
Content:
Our pics taken with this camera on the first sunny days of the spring turned out very washed out and flat. They were so underexposed that later software modification on the computer could not entirely bring them to acceptable contrast. Pictures were not sharp enough. Enlarging pics to full size on the computer revealed annoying color casts similar to those seen on frames transfered from digital video tapes. camera is very heavy, not convenient for lengthy hiking trips. battery life is good though. all in all we are very dissapointed with nikon d50.

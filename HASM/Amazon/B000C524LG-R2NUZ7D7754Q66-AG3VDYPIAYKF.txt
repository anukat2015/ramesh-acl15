Title: Great overall machine
Content:
I bought this product to replace a 3 year dirt devil bagless upright(BOO) and wow I am really really happy with it I have a combination of slate and wood floors downstairs with carpet upstairs and boy am I happy. on the carpet the power brush worked great, even on my thick shag area rug, although I don't think its meant to handle that type of carpet still worked though it and did a much better job then my dirt devil and it really pick up the cat hairs and did very well over the slate and the wood floor downstairs it really did its job, but there are a few thing the noise level is much better then my upright but still not whisper quite personally I don't care also the tools are very limited and until I put it away I didn't notice the angle suction tool, its in the back of the machine on the bottom (weird) This model does have a hepa filter in the back. The only real concern that I have is the plastic piece that connects the power brush to the aluminum wand seems a little weak (this is the only reason why i gave it 4 stars and not five) on wood floors and flat floors should not be an issue but I have slate floors which are uneven by nature. I know it's not the best machine in the world and I know the $200+ machines from Electrolux are supposed to be better but for half the price. I have now room to complain.

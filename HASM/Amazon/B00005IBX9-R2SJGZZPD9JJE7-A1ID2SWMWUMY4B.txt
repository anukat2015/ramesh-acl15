Title: Good, but with some flaws
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker after our beloved Grind and Brew finally bit the dust.  We hardly ever used the "grind" part, so I decided to forego that this time around.  
I like the new coffee maker so far (I've had it for about a month), but I'm annoyed by two design flaws:  One, the holes for pouring the water are too small, so it's easy to spill some (and forget about trying to just pour water out of a mug for one cup).  Two, the lid gets condensation on it during the brewing process, and when you lift it to put in more coffee or more water, the condensation drips down the back and onto the countertop.
The coffee's good, but just be aware of the flaws.

Title: Lots of bang for the buck
Content:
While this vacuum is not without its flaws, for the money it is a "best buy".  I finally got frustrated with the Royal I purchased a few years ago and replaced it with this Eureka for less than half what I spent on the Royal.  I read the reviews from other owners and pretty much knew the pros and cons.  I have multiple pets and hardwood floors with area rugs in each room.  The suction is impressive and the bag size is much larger than you would anticipate for such a small unit.  It has one of the longest cords I have ever seen on a vacuum, which is good and bad news.  I agree with other reviewers that the hose is really cheap and will need replacing during the life of the unit.  It would really have been nice for the power cord to be retractable.  If Eureka had a model which solves these two complaints I would have paid an extra $50.00 for the unit.  As it is, a am very pleased with the performance and supplied accessories.  Surprisingly good on the rugs.  Watch out for an unmentioned slide on the hose attachment which siphons off suction when you want less power.  I taped it since it was so easy to open accidentally.  Over all, a good performer considering the price.  Also, I ordered direct from Amazon and it arrived in just 3 days!  Another typical 5 star performance from the Amazon warehouse.

Title: I did NOT get burned by this burner!
Content:
I read some of the reviews about this burner and I was somewhat nervous about purchasing. I hunted for something similar, but all searches lead me back to this model. The burner is well made, quite heavy metal, and worked fabulously. The starter kicked in the flame each time, although I did have a long lighter handy in case. I used this burner to prepare paella on my new 15" paella pan. I loved it. Heavy duty, worked well for me, was easy to light and control the flame... I am glad I took a chance on this one!

Title: Capresso coffee maker
Content:
I did a lot of research on coffee makers and this one kept coming up the best.  It was expensive so I went with the Zojrushi instead.  I had a terrible time with an Amazon "marketplace" seller who after a month decided that they did not have any in stock.  I went with a refurbished Capresso to save money and am so glad I did.  I have wonderful coffee now with simple operation.  It has a filter and button for smaller size pots of coffee.  I later got a Capresso grinder which makes things even better.  My coffee stays warm while I do other things and come back for a second cup.

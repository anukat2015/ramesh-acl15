Title: The perfect little camera
Content:
There are those of you who might think that having no Auto Focus Motor is a big deal, it's not to me, HERE'S WHY? I grew up with a Canon AE-1 more then 20 years ago which was a Shutter-Priority camera with Manual Focus only, and still have the camera. There are times when Manual Focus comes in real handy, such as low lighting when the Auto Focus is not going to work very good. Jewelry will also cause Auto Focus to mess up and not focus right, that's when you need Manual Focus. BESIDES, DO PROFESSIONALS RELY ON AUTO FOCUS? NOT MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T. Mind you, I am not a Pro, but an Advanced Amature who has dealt with 2 or 3 SLR's and one other DSLR, the Pentax ist DL, for which my Brother wants, and that is giving me a chance to buy this wonderful Nikon D40, which is a whole lot faster, and a whole lot better, and a better Burst speed of 100 frames, which is good for me, for I love car racing, watching them go round and round the dirt track.
I was initially going to buy th Canon Digital Rebel XTI, but it has some disadvantages, mainly a Burst of only 27 frames vs Nikon's 100, and it's Exposure Compinsation was also lacking behind the Nikon. The Canon has a 2+/- vs. Nikon's 5+/- a BIG DIFFERENCE!!!!!!! 
I don't have the Nikon D40 yet, but will hopefully before Christmas.
THANK YOU NIKON FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL CAMERA THAT PUTS THE CANON REBEL XTI TO SHAME, EVEN THOUGH I GREW UP ON CANON. Sorry Canon Lovers, but I am going Nikon! All the way!!!!!!!!!! Enjoy!
UPDATE: I will be getting my D40 in about a week, stay tuned for anybody interested, and i'll let you know how much i really like it.
UPDATE! UPDATE! I now have my Nikon D40, AND I LOVE EVERY SECOND OF IT! It's easy to figure out the controls, and i really like the D-Lighting feature. My only gripe is the Grip is a little bit small, but I'll manage with that. THIS NIKON D40 KICKS THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF MY PREVIOUS PENTAX IST DL DSLR WHICH DIDN'T HAVE THE FAST AUTO FOCUS ON THE D40, WHICH I ABSOLUTETLY LOVE, AND TALK ABOUT QUIET AUTO FOCUS, THE D40 HAS IT. I WILL BE A NIKON USER FROM HERE ON OUT.
UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE! I also have now at my disposal a Canon Digital Rebel XSI Camera, and I love both, BUT I CAN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY MY NIKON D40 WILL NOT TAKE A DECENT PHOTO WITHOUT FLASH IN FULL MANUAL MODE BUT MY CANON WILL, CANON CANNOT BE THAT MUCH BETTER, THE NIKON PICTURES ARE CONSTANTLY UNDEREXPOSED WITHOUT FLASH IN MANUAL MODE, ALL OTHER MODES IT IS VERY GOOD AT TAKING PICTURES WITHOUT FLASH. Has anybody had any experience in these areas, please comment

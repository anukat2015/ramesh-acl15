Title: Correct temp isn't all
Content:
For how expensive this is and the high ratings it seems to get I can not use the words that best describe it for me other than this machine is overrated.
First, I have been roasting coffee since the 90s and have used many different types of brewing devices. I am not the smartest guy but I have some experience making a good cup of coffee. And I can usually work my way around things mechanically.
While this machine gets high ratings for the temperature it reaches the main part that holds the coffee is the cheapest thing I have ever seen. And I ask why? The coffee flow control is nothing more than a manual slide lever. That includes shutting it off. Even less expensive machines stop the flow when you pull out the carafe. Another problem is that it can clog. While it does have an overflow and shouldn't make a mess on your counter it does make a mess of the machine. 
It just boggles my mind that something so expensive has as its main component something so cheap. I write this today because it did clog and really - well you know!

Title: Great heater
Content:
I purchased two of these units to heat my bedroom and kitchen/living room area.  I live in a small 1 bedroom.  These units are great to keep my rooms warm and toasty.  When I first received it, I only noticed a bit of the smell that everyone talks about.  I notice more smell if I turn the units on high with a temperature setting of 5.  
I usually leave it on temperature setting Low at a number of 1 to 3 with the ComfortTemp on.
With experimentation, ComfortTemp seem to keep the unit on at all times, to maintain the temperature.  This will heat the unit up making it pretty hot.  Hot enough to burn oneself if touching it for a second or more.  
Without the ComfortTemp on, the unit will click on and off to heat at whatever temperature setting you choose (1-6).  This unit also has an anti-freeze setting with an asterik which also keeps the unit warm with ComfortTemp on.
I had these two units, one running approximately 12 hours a day for a month and it raised my electric bill $30.  This is in comparison with running my gas heater (which is terrible) for two weeks for $30.  
This does not dry the air like ceramic heaters and makes no noise besides the unit clicking on and off to maintain the temperature, and popping noises of the metal expanding when first turning the unit on cold.
The only concern would be if you used this around children, where the ComfortTemp setting may burn a child if they accidentally touched it.

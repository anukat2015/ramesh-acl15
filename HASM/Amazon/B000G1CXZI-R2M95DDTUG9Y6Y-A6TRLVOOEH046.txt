Title: Very loud cliicking, groaning noises
Content:
The heater works fine, but as other reviewers have noted, the heating process apparently creates expansion/shrinkage of the heating vanes, and the noise is VERY NOTICEABLE.
This heater is so loud (ironic since it has no moving parts) that it's entirely unsuitable for use in sleeping areas.  
I wouldn't buy it again. There's plenty of other choices that do the same thing without waking me up at night.

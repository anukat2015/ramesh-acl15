Title: UNBELIEVEABLE
Content:
We can't say enough great things about this fine vacuum.  We bought it mainly for our Vintage Airstream.  We travel with 3 kitties and the small upright we have been using looses suction as soon as kitty hair clogged the bagless bin, which would be about ½ way through the trailer.  So we took our new Dyson in there and was shocked - like the other folks - what it picked up - the bin was full of dirt and kitty hair and we had just vacuumed it with our former vacuum!  So then we took it into the house and had the same experience.  Now my wife wants to use it instead of our wind tunnel.  Everything in this monster is well thought out and it is very easy to take apart and put back together.  Winding it up is no big chore.  We thought a lot about putting this much money in a vacuum, but now am glad we did.  We were considering re-carpeting the house, but now the wall to wall rugs look great with new life given by our Dyson.  Our house is 3600 sq ft so we figure the Dyson saved us several thousand dollars.  A big thank you to Mr. Dyson and all the folks who worked on this project!

Title: Almost Sunk by Its Controls
Content:
I agree with those who complain about the design of the control apparatus (which they call a 'remote') which is too close to the earbuds of the head phones and thus awkward to use. And, worse, the controls may become unreliable or simply stop working if you sweat on them -- and I'm willing to bet that many of us got a Shuffle primarily to use when we work out. But like Mr Johnson says in his review, I've solved the problem by adding a Belkin accessory Belkin Headphone Adapter with Remote for iPod Shuffle which puts the controls next to the iPod itself which, of course, can be located further away from the headphones clipped, say, to your shirt. With that adjustment, I like the iPod, but whoever designed the iPod's controls ought to be fired. 
Postscript a month later: Well, the Belkin headphone adapter turned out to be a lemon. Read my review of that product: Belkin Headphone Adapter with Remote for iPod Shuffle. It fell apart. So now I'm using the Scosche adapter and it's working great. Scosche Control Adapter for 3 rd Generation iPod Shuffle.

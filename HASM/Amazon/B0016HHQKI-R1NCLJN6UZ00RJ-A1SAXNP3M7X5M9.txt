Title: Used less than a month and now leaks
Content:
I purchased this product to replace my Braun, as I broke the carafe and didn't want to spend $30 to replace.....and since this Delonghi was on sale for the same price, I figured I might as well go for a brand new machine. 
Unfortunately, after using for less than a month, an internal hose or gasket must have broken as water now pours out of the bottom as soon as you attempt to fill the reservoir. Waiting on a reply from DeLonghi customer service, it's been 3 days now and no response.  
Even without the leak, I wouldn't say I'm too happy with the machine. It does have some nice features (beeps when done, showerhead water over coffee grinds, and large capacity), but I think the negatives outweigh the positive. 
The machine is very bulky. The lid design is terrible, when you attempt to open the lid to remove the spent grinds, the condensation runs all over the back and sides of the machines and ends up all over the counter. I even tried waiting a few hours to let it cool, and it still happens. The regular brew cycle is fast but results in weak coffee and the aroma feature (much much longer brewing time) is too long and results in overextraction and a bitter smoky tasting brew. Somewhere in the middle would have been much better.
I'm going back to my Braun, much simpler design, half the size (although it's 12 cups not 14), and definitely much better tasting coffee. I think the extra 100 watts (1100 watts on Braun vs. 1000 on the Delonghi) results in hotter water passing through the grinds and a much better brew, in half the time.

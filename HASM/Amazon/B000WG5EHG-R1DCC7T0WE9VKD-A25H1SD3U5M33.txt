Title: Do not buy this item!
Content:
Not only is it very un-userfriendly (my husband still has not figured out an easier way to delete songs from there other than connecting it to the Zune software and re-formatting). It's big and bulky and the picture doesn't turn as advertised. My daughter's died one year after I purchaed it. I called Microsoft and they said they would send another one for the price of a new one. Don't waste your money on this mp3 player - there are so many others out there.

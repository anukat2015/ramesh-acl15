Title: Great heater maybe just not for tents with alot of ventilation
Content:
So I shopped around for a heater for some time to keep my girlfriend warm during a late fall camping trip.  Admittedly my tent is really a two season tent.  It has alot of mesh and thus wouldn't work all that well with this type of heater.  The reason being that the heater basically heats the area directly in front and above it.  I think if a reflector of some sort that could focus the heat all towards the front would make this heater much more practical.  
When I stood in front of it while I changed I felt that it did a great job but my girlfriend lying on an air mattress directly in front of the heater couldn't really feel the heat.  (I didn't want to keep the heater too close to the bed).  If I had a tent with less mesh Perhaps it could have contained the heat in a better way.  
I could definitely see how this heater would be excellent for heating sheds, garages or more rigid structures.  It just didn't work as well as I thought in my type of tent.

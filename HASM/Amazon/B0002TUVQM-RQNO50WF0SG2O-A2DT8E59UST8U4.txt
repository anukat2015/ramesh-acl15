Title: Loved it; but wish it lasted longer
Content:
I got one as a gift, and wondered if I'd ever use it.  I ended up using it every morning for my mix of coffee, cocoa, milk, vanilla, etc., and loved it.  After about a year the motor seized up, and I threw it out.  I bought another one, and after six months or so, it started balking.  I was able to correct that problem when I realized the heated bottom surface was flexing upwards slightly and contacting the blender blades, which I then bent up a bit using pliers.  That bought me another month, and then one of the little plastic knobs that held the spigot-handle broke off, so the only way I could use the spigot was by removing the handle and raising the plunger with pliers.
     I WISH THIS PRODUCT WERE BETTER MADE, OR THAT ANOTHER MANUFACTURER WOULD SEE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE!!!

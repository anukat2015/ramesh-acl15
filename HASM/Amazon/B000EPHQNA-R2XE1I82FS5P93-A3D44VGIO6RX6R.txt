Title: Love it!
Content:
I bought one for my husband and one for myself, and we both love it!  It's even smaller than it looks in the picture, the sound is great (especially for such a tiny unit) and it clips on securely.  I generally clip it to my shirt pocket or collar, and I haven't had any problems with it slipping.  Can't beat it - especially at this price!

Title: Best machine in its class
Content:
This is simply the best coffee machine in its price category. Yes, yes, I know some reviewers have carped about the fact that the pot has to be positioned "just so" in its holder, and that unless the black "dot" on the pour spout is precisely lined up, coffee spills all over.  So yes, they should color the dot red so it's easier to see, and make the housing for the pot itself a bit deeper so it fits snugly in place. But if you really, really love coffee, these are VERY MINOR annoyances -- after a few pots, you get the hang of it and know exactly how to position the pot and how to line up the spout. Thermal caraffe instead of a hot plate saves on electric and keeps the coffee hot and fresh for hours, and nicely warm well into the afternoon. Also, it brews coffee at precisely the right temp to bring out the best flavor, no matter what brand of coffee you use. And the design is cool.  Bravo Capresso! (I have their burr grinder, too, and it's a winner too.)

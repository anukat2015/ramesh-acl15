Title: After a few months of usage it randomly turns itself off
Content:
It is so unreliable I wouldn't buy it again. 
We set a temperature and in theory it should stay on, well, sometimes after a few seconds not having reached the temperature it would turn off. Sometimes it stays on but never for more than 2 hours. Even if we set it such that it should stay on for lets say 8 hours. A total waste of money.

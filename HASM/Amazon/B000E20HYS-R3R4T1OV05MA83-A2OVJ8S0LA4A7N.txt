Title: THISNIS A GREAT PRODUCT.
Content:
YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW SIMIPLE IT IS TO MAKE A LATTE WITH GREAT AMOUNTS OF FOAM. HOT CHOCO. ALSO FOAMS UP NICELY. THE UNTIL PRODUCES A CONSTANT TEMP. OF 180 DEGREES WHICH IS HOT BUT WON'T BURN YOU. CLEANUP IS EASY BUT YOU MUST FIRST ALLOW THE UNTIL TO COOL OFF.
YO WON'T BE SORRY YOU BOUGHT HIS DEVICE.

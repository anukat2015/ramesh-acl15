Title: so-so
Content:
I purchased this as a secondary heater to leave inside the bathroom.
For the price, I guess it's just ok. But for people who haven't purchased this yet, I'd recommend paying a bit more. The heater is quiet and it is pretty safe (I tried tipping it over just to see, and it automatically shut off). However, I don't really feel a lot of heat and I've had better heaters in the past. I have a Lakso remote-controlled heater and this is what I use in my bedroom every night. Much more expensive (around $40+ vs. $15) but you get what you pay for. What I also don't like is this doesn't oscillate.
Bottomline: it's ok, but if you're looking for a primary heater for your bedroom, you might be disappointed.

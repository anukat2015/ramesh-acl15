Title: Great little player
Content:
OK, I've only had my Microphoto for about a week and a half now, but I am very happy with it.  It's been working fine with no bugs and no issues.  Yes, the controls take a little getting used to, but the touchpad isn't rocket science, I wouldn't even say it takes days like some of the other have mentioned.  Expect to get frustrated once or twice, then learn from your mistakes and get it down in short order.  The ear buds aren't the most comfortable I've used, but they work fine and sound quality is ok.  I like the flexibility of using almost any music source (as a long time Yahoo music patron) and I didn't want to have "just another IPod" like everyone else I know ... so I got the Microphoto and got twice the storage of the 4G Nano for the same price.

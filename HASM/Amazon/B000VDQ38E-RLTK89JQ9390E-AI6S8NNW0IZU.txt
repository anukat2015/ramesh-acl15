Title: Best vacuum ever!!
Content:
I just purchased this vacuum and absolutely love it! It was very easy to put together. The attachments all have a home and seem to very secure. That was a big problem with my old Hoover. The attachments would fall off while vacuuming. Anyway, the pet hair bar on the front really works. I was amazed at all the pet hair and other debris it picked up - especially since I had just used my old vacuum the day before. The hose is plenty long enough and flexible. This is an awesome product at an awesome price. I highly recommend!!

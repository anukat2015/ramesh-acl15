Title: GREAT camera in its price class
Content:
We had an analog Canon Rebel SLR before, so while we did a lot of comparison review shopping first, we settled quickly on the Digital Rebel. The XSi version is worth the upgrade price.  Nice basic lens.  Clear, crisp pics; good automated and manual setting flexibility.  Out of the box to beautiful pics uploaded to my PC - about 10 minutes.  Can't argue with that.

Title: Great Laptop
Content:
I bought this laptop right before Christmas. It is a really great laptop to buy. Very fast, great hard drive, nice screen and nice keyboard. Only con i would say is i dont know the code for microsoft office 2007 so i cant use it. If anyone could help me with this the would be a huge help.

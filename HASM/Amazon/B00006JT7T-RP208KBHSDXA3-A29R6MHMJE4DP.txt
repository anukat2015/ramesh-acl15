Title: Read the Reviews, Bought It and was Ripped Off Too!
Content:
Upon receipt, I read the instructions and tried to sync the remote, which did sync up, but the display on the remote was blank?  Called the customer service for Bionaire and had to pay $6.00 more for them to mail me a replacement remote.  Followed instructions again...the new remote has a "partial" display and doesn't sync.  It is worse than the original one!  My only recourse now is to wrap the heater and remote up and ship back to them (according to their customer service), but I would have to spend more money to do that...NOT!  I'll just keep the heater and use without the remote and be grumpy about the whole thing...Aaagh!

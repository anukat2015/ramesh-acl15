Title: An excellent vacuum cleaner
Content:
So far, the S3765 is the best vacuum cleaner we've ever owned. We have gone thru 5 vacuums in the last 7 years and have not been satisfied with one yet. The last being a Hoover S3630, which was returned immediately (too bulky and cheaply constructed). The S3765 may be the one....I've only used it twice, but WOW!, it works great...by far the best. Suction is strong and the unit is very easy to use. Tools are perfect for our needs. We have hard wood floor through out the home, with a few large, expensive, "throw" rugs in certain rooms. We also have 2 cats and 1 dog, so there's plenty of pet hair that needs to cleaned just about on a daily basis.  This vacuum picks it ALL up! There are only a couple of drawbacks. 1.) the turbo brush and hardwood floor tools have no storage compartments or attachments, so you have to find a home them so they don't get lost. 2.) the vacuum cleans SO well that the undersized dirt cup has to be emptied after only 1 to 2 rooms. So now the only real question is durability. If it lasts, this vacuum is THE best vacuum you can buy for under $200, anywhere. It does "feel" durable. I mean, the unit and parts are feel like they are solidly built. Only time will tell. I HIGHLY RECOMEND this vacuum to anyone.

Title: The best DSLR camera that I owned
Content:
After years with using point-shoot cameras, I decided to switch to DSLR. First I purchased Olympus E-500 but after only few weeks of use, I returened, there is many things that I did not like which I won't mention here. Then I went for Canon XTi which lasted only two days at my home. The last...I purchased D50 with two lense kit and this been already a year since I used it. Since then I purchase accessories SB-600 flash, set of lense filter for special effect, high speed/capacity SD cards, and dozen of DSLR books to take full advantage of this camera functions. I can't stop loving it. It is worth every penny that I paid for it. Plus ability to use almost all old lenses (which I can find on the local fleemarket for [..] is making this camera is unbelivable value. All in all, I shoot 3,000+ and only few of them were unuseable (which is all my fault). Definatly get this camera, you will love it.

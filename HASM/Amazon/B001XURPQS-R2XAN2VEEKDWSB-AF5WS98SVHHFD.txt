Title: No Price Gurantee---bad sale
Content:
In less than 10 days of my buying the camera body, lens 18-55mm and 55-250mm, Amazon listed to sell the same camera and all the two lens at lower price than what I paid for  by ~$50. When I called the customer service, the experience was NOT GOOD, they REFUSED TO ADJUST the prices stating a long story of changes in Amazon policy. I am just wordering all the stores Guranttee the price for atleast 15days whereas others guranttee for 30 days or even more.
Amazon customer service wanted me to return the camera and lens and buy it again. This is same thing as adjusting the price and refunding me the difference. I don't understand the logic of returning.
Amazon need to make sure they gurantee the price for atleast 15days or make sure same products with lower price are NOT ATLEAST SOLD ON THEIR WEB PAGE for 15 days. This is bad experience. I stil expect them to change the policy and refund me $50.
WAKE UP AMAZON. This is REAL WORLD. You are NOT WORKING IN ISOLATION AND NEED TO COMPLY WITH WHAT OTHERS DO AND THAT"S THE WAY TO BE COMPETITIVE>

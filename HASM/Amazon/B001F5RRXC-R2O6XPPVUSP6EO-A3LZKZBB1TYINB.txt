Title: Poor quality
Content:
Arrived safely, opened box and plugged in the heater. It sounded louder than a blender on high. Couldn't even hear someone else talk. Then the grinding noises started and the device vibrated across my wood floor. Looking at it further it had dings and scratches on the front chrome. Called support and they new exactly what it was and acted like it happens often. Item was DOA and now I gotta go through the return process and get another heater from a different company.

Title: heating element broke twice
Content:
I did a lot of research before buying this product. I wanted a carafe so we could keep the coffee warm without using extra electricity or burning the coffee. Don't buy this one. The heating element broke within a week of use. I sent it back, got a new one, and it did the same thing. It's not an electrical issue, the clock still worked. It just would not make coffee anymore.

Title: A housewife's dream come true!
Content:
I've never vacuumed my house in such a short time. I've never vacuumed my house without cursing God, man and the universe before. It's the best thing that's ever happened to me! Straight out of the box it leapt and started sucking up everything in sight! It has a nozzle that makes twists and turns around the legs of every piece of furniture. It has a non-electric hose (more flexibility) with a turbohead carpet attachment. It rocks harder than Elvis Costello, dare I say it?
 I'M SO HAPPY!!!!!!
(imagine tears of joy raining down and shorting out the appliance)
The guy at Witbeck's was very helpful in sorting out which model to get. By no means did he suggest the most expensive, and even suggested one cheaper. But I had to have that turbo nozzle!

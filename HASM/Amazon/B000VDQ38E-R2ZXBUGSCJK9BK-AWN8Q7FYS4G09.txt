Title: Fantastic vacuum cleaner
Content:
Bissell 3920 Pet Hair Eraser Dual-Cyclonic Upright Vacuum Cleaner This vacuum cleaner lives up to its name. It does a fantastic job of picking up ALL the cat hair. I couldn't believe there was so much left on the carpeting from my other relatively new vacuum cleaner. The easy to empty chamber is a big plus. I'm so glad I bought it!!! It arrived well before the estimated date of arrival,too. Thanks,Amazon and Bissell.

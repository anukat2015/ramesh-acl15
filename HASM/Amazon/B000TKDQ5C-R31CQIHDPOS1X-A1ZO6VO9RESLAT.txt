Title: Great Heater!
Content:
Incredible little heater, it is completely silent and very efficient in heating even a medium sized room. The best thing about this portable heater is that it doesn't make the room have that burned smell that many other heaters emit. The air smells fresh and the heat is warm and soothing, not stale. No cartridges or replacement filters or oils needed. So it's a one-time purchase and works great!

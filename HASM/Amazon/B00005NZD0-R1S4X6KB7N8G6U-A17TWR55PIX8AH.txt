Title: Excellent for a couple
Content:
My husband gave me this coffee maker and it is wonderful. If you are fickle about your coffee....i.e. sometimes you want a mocha or sometimes an espresso or latte, but also might want to just make a pot, this coffee maker is GREAT because you can do both at the same time. It is very very easy to maintain and nothing has ever gone wrong with it (except that I have broken the glass caraffe, but that is easy to replace.)
You will love it.

Title: Great heater!
Content:
I use this heater often when I'm sitting at my computer or watching TV because the baseboard heaters in my apartment take forever to heat up if they are turned off and don't regulate the temperature very well if they are left on. I usually leave it on the low setting, as the high setting is too warm unless it's 8-10 feet away and oscillating to heat up more than one person. (It will take a long time if you're trying to use it to heat up a room; it's designed to heat up whatever it's pointed at!)
It also stays completely cool to the touch; my cats were very curious about it when I set it up initially and I didn't have to worry about them getting too close to it. (Plus it shuts off when it's moved or tipped over, another great feature!)
I'm not sure how well it would work when you're sleeping, as it's fairly bright and any blankets you have on would probably block the heat from reaching your skin anyway.

Title: SOLEUS AIR = WORST COMPANY EVER
Content:
I have purchased 3 heaters from Soleus Air.  Two of these 360 and one previous mica flat one.  All three have had serious problems.  Twice Soleus shipped me the wrong heater and we had to exchange it.  They advertised the digital version with a remote, but sent the non-remote version.  The first time, they gave me a $10 discout and I kept the heater.  The next time, I had to return the heater and wait for a replacement.
Of the two HM5-15R-32 360 heaters I have, both have died.  They are junk.  Probably made in China.  One made so much noise heating up that my daughter (who is 8) asked to have it removed from her room.  We moved it to our bedroom and it did indeed make a ton of popping and cracking as it heated up and cooled down.  A few months later it stopped working all together (it just goes off after about 5 minutes of running).
The other 360 we have started producing a horrible burning electrical smell.  I wrote to the company who sold us the heater and they refused to stand behind their return policy.  I have not connected Soleus air directly, but I have a bad feeling it's just going to be more run around.  
Hopefully Soleus air goes out of business soon, because the products they make are horrible.  At least the 3 we've bought.  Wish I could give them negative stars...

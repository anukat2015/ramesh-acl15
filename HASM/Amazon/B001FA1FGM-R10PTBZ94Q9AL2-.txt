Title: this digital model won't work with a timer
Content:
I bought the Sunbeam SLP3310 at a big box store.  My intention was to plug it into a 3-prong, 1875watt timer and have it on morning to night, then off until the next morning.  Well, this black digital (without a 'memory') model won't work with a timer.  So I returned the 3310 for a refund.  I ordered on line Sunbeam's identical SLP3300 that is analog, with 2 rotary dials.  It is white, silent, 2 heat settings, plus a thermostat.  And, it works with a timer!  And the SLP3300 will come back on after a power outage whereas the digital 3310 won't.  Kept on the 'low' setting, with the t-stat on a moderate setting, the 3300 keeps my 12 x 14 bedroom with 8 foot ceilings very comfortable.  The 'high' setting could burn paint off a wall if positioned too close.

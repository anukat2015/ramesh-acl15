Title: Kept flooding my countertop
Content:
Not sure if it's the cone filter design, but the bottom of the filter would get coffee grinds stuck in it and it coffee would fill up, go over the top and flood my kitchen counter, once every month or two. Eventually replaced it out of frustration about a year after purchasing it. Tried a KitchenAid but that died just after the warranty ran out. Now I'm trying Capresso. Hopefully that will perform better!

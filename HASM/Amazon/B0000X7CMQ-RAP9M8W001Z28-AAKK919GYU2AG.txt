Title: Not very good
Content:
This coffee brewing system is not very good at all. I am very disappointed with it. The carafe is one of the worst I have ever seen. The lid does not loosen without a fight, you have to rotate the entire carafe, and it cannot be done without a lot of pressure.
This is not an ergonomically designed system, either. Everything is turned 90 degrees, and makes for awkward handling.

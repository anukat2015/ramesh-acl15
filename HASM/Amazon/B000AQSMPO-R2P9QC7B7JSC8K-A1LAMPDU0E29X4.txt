Title: Very convenient, but small portions
Content:
This is great if you need both regular and decaf in the same house.  It is very convenient, but you pay for it.  Before you buy this type of machine make sure you know how many ounces are in your favorite cup!  A cup of coffee is not a mug.  
I have the B40 and the larger size brew is only 9oz which is only a small mug.  Since the coffee grounds are one size fits all, you will want to buy "bold" coffee to get a good mug.  My solution has been to brew two of the smaller cups (7oz) into my usual mug.  This of course doubles my cost per mug.  
A better solution is to buy the reusable filter and fill to taste.  I can pack the filter full and run two 7oz cycles through one set of grounds to get a 14oz mug of coffee.
Since I drink so much coffee, I wish that it had a larger water reservoir.

Title: It worked well for a while!!
Content:
I bought this unit on Jan 9th,the unit worked well until it stopped working entirely. I called the Lasko customer service and to make a long story short they are sending me a new one within 7-14 days.  The short time I had of usage I can say it worked well, heating my selected room efficiently and quietly. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating is because it failed me. I hope this helps in making a decision.

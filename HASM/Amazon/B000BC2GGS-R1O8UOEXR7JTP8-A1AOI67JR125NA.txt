Title: Disappointed
Content:
We had bought the heater after reading the reviews from consumer reports.  After we got it, we were severely disappointed.  The unit displays a room temperature that much warmer than it actually.  We compared the displayed room temperature with another two other thermometers and Honwywell said it was 70 while the other two said it was 55.  It kept shutting and could not heat up a 12x15 room.  This review is written two days after opening and using the product.  It certainly is quiet no doubt about that since it does not do anything anyway.

Title: Works as promised; Shipping policy needs to be changed
Content:
I ordered this product to use in Afghanistan during the cold winter.  It worked very well to take the edge off of the chilly winter nights. The INDOOR temperature was frequently in the mid-40s F before I received this heater. 
The only gripe I have is that the company (not Amazon) does not ship to APO addresses.  I had to have this sent to my wife back in the states and have her repackage it and send over to me in Afghanistan.  In effect, I had to pay double shipping.  It is unfortunate that the company is not willing to help out our troops by shipping to APO/FPO addresses.

Title: best coffeemaker I've ever owned
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker because I was moving into an apartment that required an auto-shutoff feature for all coffeemakers, and this was the best one I found through my extensive research.  My previous coffeemaker didn't have the safety features I needed, so I ended up getting this one at a local hardware store.  I love it!  It makes great coffee!  The best coffeemaker I've ever owned!  And it does have the safety features I need.
My only issue with it is it's too big!  I couldn't find anything smaller than a 12 cup coffeemaker with the automatic shutoff feature.  I solve this problem by brewing four to six servings at a time and then keeping what I don't drink in the fridge.  When I need the caffine, I'll reheat a cup.  I only need to brew coffee every few days that way.
The carafe is really easy to pour from.  I saw some reviews saying that the spout dripped; perhaps those people had gotten defective carafes.  I've never had any dripping problems with the carafe.
I've never used the programming feature.  But if I decide I want coffee every day instead of three to five days a week, I'll probably end up learning how to use that feature.  It's good to have it on there.
Overall, a great machine to have.

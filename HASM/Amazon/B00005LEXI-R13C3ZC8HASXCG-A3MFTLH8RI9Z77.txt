Title: Great Portable Heater
Content:
Using the throw away Propane bottles makes this a great portable heater. One bottle will heat on low for about five hours. You can also buy a hose to hook into a bigger Propane tank. The heater is lite, easy to ignite and easy to move. On a cold night in a tent or small camper this is a nice heater. Note: If using a hose to run this heater off a bigger tank of Propane I recommend using a fuel filter that can be purchased for this item. This keeps the heater from getting gummed up from unused propane left in the hose.

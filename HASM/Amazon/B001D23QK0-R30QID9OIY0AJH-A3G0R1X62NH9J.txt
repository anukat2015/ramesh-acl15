Title: Best bargain for an mp3 player these days.
Content:
Creative Zens and Muvos have always had great sound, but their BEST benefit is the way you can use Windows Explorer to just drag and drop song files and folders into the player just like you handle ANY OTHER FILE.  As someone who has sat waiting for friends as they wandered through the wilds of iTunes (mandatory software for iPods) trying to find where iTunes has put their latest fave (is it under techno or electronica or something else?), I know the value of being able to categorize the music on your hard drive the way you personally prefer (for me, 1GB folders of genre, like "80's 4", and so on).  The navigation on this player is pretty standard for the button-click type, and the battery life is above average.  So save your money and get a Zen.

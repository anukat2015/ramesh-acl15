Title: Bionaire Heater
Content:
It's sturdy
-It emits a little heat from both sides, but most of the heat comes from the top of the heater.
-It makes the room temperature a little comfortable (still a little chilly), as long as the door to that room is closed.
-You had to be sitting directly in front of the heater and close, in order to really feel the heat.
My room space is approximately 12LX12W
I would recommend buying, but don't expect it to replace the work of the heating vents

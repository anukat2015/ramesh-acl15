Title: Finally-A wonderful coffeemaker
Content:
I purchased a capresso coffemaker in the 1990's and loved it.  However it was used so much that it wore out.  It lasted about 10 years.  However I could never find one to replace it that I liked.  Well now Capresso has finally come up with a model that is better than the one I used to own.  It makes a wonderful HOT cup of coffee and it tastes so great! It's very easy to use, especially filling the tank and I just love it.  Thank you Capresso.

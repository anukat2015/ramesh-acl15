Title: Perfect product, GReat Design.
Content:
This is the perfect product for what it is designed to do.  Great radio reception and a strong clip.  I use it running because it's tiny like the ipod shuffle, except WAY cheaper and WAY more functionality.  People buying the ipod mini or shuffle just want to look cool, when this is obviously the superior product.

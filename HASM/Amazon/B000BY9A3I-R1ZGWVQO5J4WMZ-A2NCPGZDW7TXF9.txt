Title: Nice Change of Pace!
Content:
I live in a late 1800's "country" house (in other words, it is 85% wood floors and 15% braided rugs).  I have always used standard style vacuums but after my last one died, I tried this canister version.  So far it is great!  It is not too loud and the adjustable suction is great for curtains and other things that would get yanked away with a standard vac.  It is far superior to previous vacs I have owned.  They would always kick dirt around on bare floors and never do a great job.  This is a night and day difference.  I highly recommend it for those people with mostly hardwood, tile, laminate, and low pile carpet.  I took 1 star off because this really will not work well on high pile carpet from what I have seen.  I have high pile in a walk in closet only and my old upright performed a lot better on that.  That being said, it is WELL WORTH the trade off.  No more sweeping the wood floor kitchen with a broom and then vacuuming up the pile of dirt!

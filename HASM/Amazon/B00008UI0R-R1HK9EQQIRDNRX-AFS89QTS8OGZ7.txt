Title: Awesome Vacuum
Content:
This is the greatest vacuum that I have ever owned.  I have tried a lot of different brands with no success.  This one is different.  It sucks up so much dirt & pet hair that I have to empty the dirt cup about 4 times per session.  My other vacuums over the years I emptied maybe twice per session.  My carpets look like they are new and they are about 10 years old.  I have two huge dogs (Newfoundland and a Great Pyrenees)and they leave a trail of dirt and fur everywhere.  This vac can pick up whatever they can put down.  It is amazingly quiet for such a powerful machine.  The attachments are very easy to use and the power cord is long enough that you can move through several rooms without having to unplug & plug back in.  Also, reasonably priced.  I definitely recommend this product.

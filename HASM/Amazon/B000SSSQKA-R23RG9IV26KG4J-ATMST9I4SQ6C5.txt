Title: Motor died in less than a month/Update
Content:
Well, this looked like a good unit and the reviews were good, but I am now sorry I bought the vacuum.  I have owned it for less than one month and the motor has an problem already.  It is cycling and drawing alot of current(I know because my lights dim when using it).  It did not do that for the first 3-4 times of use.  I have checked the filters and put in a new bag and verified that there is no clog in the hoseline.  If I can find the warranty card and can get it serviced under warranty, I will report back, but this was very disappointing. Update: I brought the unit to an authorized repair center(closest was ~50-60 miles away) on 6/24.  Within a few days it was determined that the motor had failed.  Panasonic did not get the replacement motor to the repair center until 7/24 and I picked up the unit yesterday, 7/31(the tech forgot to enter that the work was done, so that was an extra few days delay.  So the pro was that it was easy to arrange for the warranty service, but the amount of time it took was fairly long.  The unit does seem to work better than when first purchased, so it was probably defective from the start.

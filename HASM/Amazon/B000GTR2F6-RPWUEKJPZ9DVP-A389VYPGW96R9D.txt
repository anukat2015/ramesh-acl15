Title: works spradically
Content:
After a week of use my Keurig b70 started shutting off after brewing. Also it stopped pumping water. Sometimes it will work after I turn it on and off a few times. This is not very convenient. I will exchange it as soon as keurig tech calls back. I have called customer service 3 times. I feel like I am getting the run around with customer service.

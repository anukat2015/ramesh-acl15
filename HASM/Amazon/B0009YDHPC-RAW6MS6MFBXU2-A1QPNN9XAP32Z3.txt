Title: Piece of junk!
Content:
I would not recommend this machine. It's plastic and bulky and pretty much cheap looking. The milk frothing "wand" is short and akward to use. As soon as it hits the milk, it's a foam explosion and makes a big mess. To top it off, the espresso isn't even hot. I haven't bothered to try out the coffee side, as I'm perfectly happy with my no fuss french press. Don't waste your money on this item!

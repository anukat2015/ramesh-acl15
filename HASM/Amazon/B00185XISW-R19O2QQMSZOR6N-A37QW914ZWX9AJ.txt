Title: ECO Heater
Content:
The first ECO heater arrived in under a week but was damaged. We received a replacement promptly and without fuss.
The heater is everything they say it is. It takes very little electricity, it is safe, in that it does not get dangerously hot but it still pumps out a lot of heat. Enough to  keep half of our large house warm.
We will be ordering two more and look forward to saving a LOT on heating oil this winter.
Cheers, 
Regina

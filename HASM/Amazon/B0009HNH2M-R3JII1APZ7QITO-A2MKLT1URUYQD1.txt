Title: Works for me
Content:
The Duros is my first canister vacuum.  I did a lot of research.  Even though this model got a so-so rating from Consumer Reports, it was more affordable for me.  Other purchasers seemed to love or hate it.  It doesn't seem any louder to me than my old upright was.  The attachment holder IS a pain.  The attachments DON'T stay on while vacuumming.  It has a hard time rolling over its own cord.  But that's ok, because in every other way, it's a peach. It's so much easier to clean my tile floors, swap to an attachment and do upholstery, and then tackle the stairs without the hassle of dragging and pushing the upright. And when I'm done, just push the button and rewind the cord!

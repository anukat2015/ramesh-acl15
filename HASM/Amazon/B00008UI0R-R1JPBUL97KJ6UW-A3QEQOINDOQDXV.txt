Title: Hoover WindTunnel review
Content:
I've used the WindTunnel several times now and am very pleased with its performance. It's got great suction and I love the way it propels itself forward on rugs. I also like the bagless feature and the hepa filter. It's a great vacuum cleaner for the price!

Title: A+++ powerful lightweight laptop - LOVE iT!!!
Content:
I could not be happier with this powerful little laptop. I have a 17" dell but it's so heavy it's just not convenient to lug around. I tried a Dell netbook for a while and i liked it's small size but it the screen was just too small to see enough - so I'd end up going to my larger laptop to actually peruse the web page or what ever. But - this Toshiba is the PERFECT combination of small/ lightweight with a screen large enough to do all I want to. It's so light I can easily carry it with one hand. The screen is sharp and clear, the battery life is awesome. I chose the white color because i often use it in low light conditions and the white keys show up easily with just the light of the screen. The keyboard has a good feel and I love the extra features of the touch pad. It has some pretty cool scrolling features which I am now addicted to. I recommend highly this great little laptop and am happier with this purchase than I have been with any computer in a long time.

Title: Works great and a good value for your money
Content:
First off, when it arrived I couldn't believe how small it was.  I was a little worried but it truly does work.  I use it to warm up a room that is generally a few degrees colder than the rest of the house.  It easily heats it up to a few degrees warmer than the rest of the house in a medium size room(12x19) with one wall completely open to the kitchen.  To me this is asking a lot out of a small space heater but it gets the job done.  Realize that it is definitely not silent, but I don't consider the fan noisy.  My last space heater was an oil filled radiator.  Compared to it, this one heats up the room much quicker but I do think it makes the air a little drier than the oil filled radiator.  I would not call it bone dry, but I do notice it.  It is also nice that you can turn the heat directly on you since it has the fan.  All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.

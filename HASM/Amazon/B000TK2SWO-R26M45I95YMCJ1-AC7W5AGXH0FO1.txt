Title: Big heat in a small package.
Content:
This heater is made by the same company that makes the Farenheat model of this same product. For about $30-40 savings you can pick up that model.
Overall a great product. I am located in central North Dakota and have this heater in my 3 stall garage. I have the thermostat set to a notch below the low setting and it keeps it at a comfortable 45F. Expect a hike in the electric bill, but its to be expected.

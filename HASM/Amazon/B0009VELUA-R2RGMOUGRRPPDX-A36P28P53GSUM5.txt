Title: Party favor!
Content:
We have had this coffee maker about 6 months now and absolutely love it. From other reviewers: if it breaks down, who cares, buy another one especially if you love it right? My wife loves it because it is easy to use, set the timer and let it do its magic. Set it before bedtime and wake up to freshly brewed, and hot coffee. She admits she likes to grind her own beans just so that she can keep the small grinder clean from the previously flavored beans. I like that the interior decanter is plastic so you do not get that "stainless steel taste". It is just as easy to pop out and clean. It has a little lift handle to lift it out of the holder like a bucket. And we really love that you can set the cup preference for 2-4 cups just for the morning, or 12 cups for parties or get togethers. And the best part...no glass decanter to potentially break or spilling/dripping of coffee when pouring. You just press down on the lever and presto! Hot coffee...or water for hot chocolate. 
The only thing missing? An LED light under the pour spout would be perfect to see how full your cup is getting. Easily remedied by a lighter colored coffee mug. Compact and easy to clean, buy it!

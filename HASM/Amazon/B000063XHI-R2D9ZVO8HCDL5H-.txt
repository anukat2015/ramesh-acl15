Title: WORTH THE MONEY!!!
Content:
This Capresso brews one of the best tasting cups of coffee I ever had from a in home coffeemaker.  The bitterness is all but eliminated with the charcoal filter.  Coffee stays hot up to three hours and if you pre heat the pot with hot water you can get up to four hours.  I have to admit I was hesitant about spending over ... for a coffee maker but it was money well spent.  I highly recomend this product.

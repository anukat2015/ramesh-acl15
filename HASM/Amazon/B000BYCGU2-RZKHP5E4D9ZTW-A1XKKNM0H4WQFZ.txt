Title: The second best drip coffee maker and worth the price!
Content:
If you are looking to brew fresh ground coffee at the right temperature, with the correct amount of water contact time, there are very limited choices of machines from which to choose. The hundreds of "Mr. Coffee" type brewers are all basically the same and simply don't do right by the beans. Water too hot, not hot enough, brew too fast or too slow. The Technivorm is, arguably the only other option. It costs a bit more. The Capresso MT-500 is certainly more commercially available, on line and at higher-end kitchen/home retail stores. It is a proven machine having been available unchanged for some years now. The are only two choices here: all metal alloy or the model with the black plastic coffee filter holder unit. You choose whichever model fits your kitchen style. The thermal carafe does indeed keep the brew hot for a couple of hours (as advertised) and is a far better idea than a glass carafe sitting on a warmer plate.  It's not likely anyone interested in correctly brewing coffee would be doing that, right? The Capresso also features a built-in activated charcoal filter to remove chlorine and contaminants from the water before it gets to the beans, in case you're stuck using water from the tap. 
If you're not so picky about your coffee and simply drink the stuff for the buzz, save your money and buy a cheapy, leave the brew on the warmer until it burns, break the glass carafe and replace it or the whole machine a few times and so be it.  But if you want to really *taste* the coffee and are stimulated more by the fresh brewed aroma than the caffeine, then step up to a coffee brewer that does it right.

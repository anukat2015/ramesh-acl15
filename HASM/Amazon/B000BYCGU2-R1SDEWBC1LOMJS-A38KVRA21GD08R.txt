Content:
WE are avid coffee drinkers brewing probably too many pots a day.  I would not buy or recommend this pot again and here are my reasons why. 1.) The red level ball rarely pops up, you need to tap the pot, 2.) The pot is extremely noisy when brewing, 3.) The water well is hard to fill, we ended up buying a pitcher to use, 4.) the lid is a pain always having to adjust for pouring or keeping warm, 5.) The coffee pours too slow, 6.) the filters are expensive and for the amt we brew we would be chaning filters once a week.
We loved our Braun not sure why they quit making coffee pots.
thanks

Title: Best 13.3" laptop on the market
Content:
I have owned this computer for about 3 months now and am as thrilled with it as when I first received it. It is fast, fashionable, and is extremely a  pleasure to use. Every time I am in public people are always complimenting the looks of this little beauty. I have read reviews about the display not being up to par but this cant be further from the truth. After adjusting the contrast and color on my display to my preference the picture pops with clarity and is perfect for watching my movies in hd with fantastic sound quality. I average about 7 hours battery life on balanced mode and 9 hours on battery saving mode. If you keep it in performance mode to play games you will average between 4 and 5 hours of battery life. The option to play modern games and photo and video editing with the nvidia graphics card is a big plus. Watching movies with the Intel graphics card is still fantastic while saving battery life. The support I have received from Asus with questions and driver updates has been second to none. Plus the fire and accidental breakage protection for one year cant be found with any other manufacturer for free. I am very happy after all the research, that I purchased the asus ul30vt-x1. Make sure you purchase the portable dvd rewritable drive that amazon is selling with the ul30vt, they go great together. I guarantee you will be just as excited as me with this superb laptop.

Title: Hoover s3765-040
Content:
The price for this vacuum was excellant.  It is quieter than an upright, and it is much easier to transport from downstairs to upstairs.  The canister does not roll as smoothly as I expected and the cord must be pulled out or it will come out of the socket, but it is great for getting in the areas an upright can't reach and it easy to store.

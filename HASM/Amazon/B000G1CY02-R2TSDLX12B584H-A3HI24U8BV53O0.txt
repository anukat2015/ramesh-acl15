Title: DeLonghi HHP1500 heater
Content:
I've had the DeLonghi HHP1500 space heater (which I bought through Amazon) only a few weeks, but so far, so good.  It is used in a back room (usually the coldest room in the house)in my 1947 house that has only a floor furnace in the living room. The space heater is usually set on Low, and this setting takes the chill off the space.  If I spend much time in the room, I turn the heater up to a comfortable temperature.  I've never turned it all the way up. I have not received my electric bill since I started using the heater.

Title: pretty good vacuum-even for cars
Content:
i got this after doing lots of research, although i have only used it twice it definitely picks up the pet hair, so much in fact that you will find yourself emptying the container a good bit. i also used it for the dog hair that is all over my car (black cloth seats are a nightmare with 2 dogs) and it worked very well. i wasn't overly impressed however with the special pet hair tools that are included, they definitely didn't work well in my car but to be fair i haven't tried them yet on my furniture which is what they are actually designed for. overall i am very pleased with this product, it does what it is supposed to do & the price was very reasonable.

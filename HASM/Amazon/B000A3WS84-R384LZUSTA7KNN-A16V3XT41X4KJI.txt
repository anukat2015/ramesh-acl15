Title: I'm sticking with my sony MD
Content:
Everyone was saying that I was locked in the stone ages because I refused to lose my sony md and get an ipod.
I finally purchased one and returned it within a week.  It just isn't as versitile as my sony MD.  
The battery life is horrid, it doesn't even have a built in charger for the battery.  Can't record live or from any source for that matter. 
Good thing that I stocked up on blank 1GB MDs because it doesn't look like I can find them anywhere anymore.  
Maybe when the ipod comes with a little more features (I can watch full length movies on my moto cell phone) and a better price (it is a money sink hole as someone else mentioned) maybe, just maybe I'll leave the flintstones and join the rest of the jetsons.

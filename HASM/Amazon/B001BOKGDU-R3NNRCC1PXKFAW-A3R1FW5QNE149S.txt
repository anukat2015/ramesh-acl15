Title: The Little Coffee Maker That Really Works
Content:
I read a lot of reviews of other coffee makers before deciding on this one.Very easy to use. I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, but this baby can make enough for 2. I like simple efficient products.Brews in less than 5 minutes. Easy to clean.You can spend more money on timers,swing out baskets, exotic warmers and all the other extras.It doesn't leak, drip, have a clock that doesn't keep time or do any of the other weird things that you might get with a more expensive product. There is a 25 oz. carafe. It has an on/off switch. A light to show when its on or off. It has a "Keep Hot Plate" and a place to store the cord.It uses 4-cup or 8 to 12 cup basket filters. 
Bottom line, it makes great coffee and is simple to use.

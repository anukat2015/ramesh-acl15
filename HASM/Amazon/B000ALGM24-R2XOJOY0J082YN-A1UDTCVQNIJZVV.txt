Title: Has helped me save money
Content:
I've had this thermostat for a couple months now and it has worked great.  I bought this as an upgrade from a 5+2 programmable thermostat so I could make unique programs for each day.  It was easy to install - the instructions were straight-forward.  I like the backlighting - saves me from turning on a light.

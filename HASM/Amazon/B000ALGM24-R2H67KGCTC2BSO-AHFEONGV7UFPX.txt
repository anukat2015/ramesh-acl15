Title: Hunter really makes the best thermostats
Content:
I had a Hunter thermostat I bought years ago in another home I had, and I've moved a number of times since.  in my other homes I either suffered through with the previously installed White-Rodgers thermostat, or bought a Honeywell because that is all that they had at the local Home Depot.  I moved again this summer, didn't like the White-Rodgers, and decided to spend some time online looking for a Hunter, which I found.
I am so pleased that I took the time to find the Hunter.  Well-written instructions and simple installation and setup.  More importantly, this thing is easy to use and has a lot of nice little features (like the "Home Today" button) that are so practical and easy to use, and they fit they way you actually need the product to work.
Buy this . . . you won't go wrong with it.

Title: Better than I expected..
Content:
I was wary of buying this laptop at first, was scared away and told bad things about Semperon processors, but all in all this laptop has exceeded my expectations. I originally bought it just to check my emails and chat with friends, maybe some light gaming... but I can play games like Everquest II just fine with quality graphics. I'm sure this laptop wouldn't work well in huge raids but it CAN game despite what I was told by many people.
 Only negative thing I can think of would be that it has no HDMI. It has the port sealed off, it is only available on the upgraded models. Also if you are gonna game I'd recommend getting a wireless mouse to go with this, I got the kensington Ci95 M... bit different than normal mice but worth it!

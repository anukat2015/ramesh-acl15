Title: delonghi - small yet powerful
Content:
So i was tired of freezing in the winter and waiting for my building's central heat to come on. So i bought this for my bedroom. It produces a really large amount of heat. It doesn't have a fan though, so you just have to wait for the air to circulate, which it does somehow, or point a fan at it. The first 3 hours it is used, it produces a nasty nasty smell but this is expected and never occurs afterwards. It has a timer and three power settings...all useful stuff. That's it, it comes assembled, on wheels, is easy to move around and is generally a lovable companion. I program it to turn on just before i wake up inthe morning so my room is warm when i get up. Probably won't heat a huge house but good for anything smaller than that. could probably heat a large living room well.

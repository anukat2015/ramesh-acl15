Title: Keep the paper towel handy!
Content:
Do not buy this product.  Hamilton Beach should be ashamed of themselves for putting such an inferior product on the market.  I owned the original 12 cup version and had it for 3 years without issue until the power button stopped working one day.  Having loved that coffee maker and being the only java drinker in the house, I opted for the 6 cup maker this time around.  Big mistake!  This thing leaks like crazy.  I also noticed that the design of the 12 cup makers has changed since they came out with the original design, so I would not trust those either.  I love not having a glass carafe, but hate the clean up due to the leaky nature of this product.

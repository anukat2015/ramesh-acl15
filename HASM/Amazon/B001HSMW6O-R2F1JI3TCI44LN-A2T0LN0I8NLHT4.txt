Title: Same Problem, Different Day
Content:
As several reviewers have previously stated, the pot leaks.  Before making my purchase, I read all of the reviews, and knew that there might be a problem.  Because the most recent reveiws were favorable, I assumed (hoped) that Black & Decker had remedied the situation, and that I would be receiving a non-leaking pot.  Unfortunately, that was not the case. Perhaps my order was filled from old stock, or perhaps not all of the pots have the leaking problem.  In any case, mine did leak.  I immediately called the "help line", and was told that it would cost over $60 for a replacement carafe.  If you happened to be in a quiet place when I made that call, I would wager that you heard my response - no matter where you live.  I was immediately transferred to a manager who told me that a new carafe would be shipped to me at no charge.  The pots, however, were on backorder, and that it would take four to six weeks.  So, I'm still waiting - pouring each cup of coffee over the sink to minimize the mess.  BUT, it's worth it!  For years I have enjoyed owning a Spacemaker Coffeemaker - we even moved and installed it in three different homes.  Sadly, with our last move, I decided that the coffeemaker's almond color would not blend well with our new white cabinetry.  "I'll just buy a new one," I thought.  When I went to buy one, none were to be found.  I checked every store and even looked on eBay for a used one, but could not find one.  At last I found this one! So despite the leaky pot, I know that EVENTUALLY I will love it!

Title: Pretty cool
Content:
Other than the fact that it makes Barbi-sized cups of coffee, this is a slick machine.  To fill a regular mug, you have to select the travel mug option.  The small brew option makes about enough coffee for a shot glass.  To fill a travel mug or large mug, you have to run the K-Cup twice.  Not a big deal, but something you should know before buying. 
Overall, this is a well-made piece of equipment that brews good, if not expensive, coffee.

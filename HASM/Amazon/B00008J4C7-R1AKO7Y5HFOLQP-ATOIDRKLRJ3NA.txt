Title: Agreed with previous reviews
Content:
I don't think it needs much more reviews but I thought I'd contribute. I probably bought before there was any review yet and now I wished there had been. It does look like junk, the power chord is way too short, you cannot adjust the power, you can only lift it from the rear which feels odd, it's not very ergonomic and the accessories are all over the place. Anyway, now I know that bagless should be the way to go and I'll make sure I'll choose right next time. I'll keep this one for the attic...

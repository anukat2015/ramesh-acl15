Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
This vacuum had surprising suction.  I could not believe how much stuff this vacuum picked up.  It makes me think that my previous vacuum was not doing anything.  Everytime I use this vacuum on my rugs the cannister is full!  I like that there are no bags to buy and I can see what it picks up.  I was a little concerned when there was not a separate attachment for hard floors but it does the job.  The only drawback I can think of is that stairs are a little difficult to clean especially rug.

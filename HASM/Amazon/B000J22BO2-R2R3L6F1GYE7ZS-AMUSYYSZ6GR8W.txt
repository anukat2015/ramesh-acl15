Title: Excellent - but you need to work to get the best from it
Content:
Consistently topping the recommendation lists for entry level Digital SLR cameras the 400D (Rebel XTi) is a fine piece of equipment. There are more than enough reviews here which to extol the cameras virtues and facilities; it is certainly an easy to use camera. However while is will work well enough on fully automatic mode, I have found that in order to get the very best out if it you have to do a little bit of work yourself. Different circumstances will warrant the camera operator selecting specific preferences, be it shutter speed or aperture, and perhaps allowing the camera automatic function to provide the rest, in order to produce the desired results. 
But perhaps the most important area where the user needs to be watchful is with the focusing. Especially with close-up work I now no longer use the cameras automatic focusing but rely on the eye and the viewfinder to ensure accurate focusing. The difference is considerable; in fact I was ready to up-grade the lens until I carried out a few experiments and proved what the standard 18-55mm lens could do, and it proved to be quite up to the job. Knowing what the standard lens can doo means I can now look much more specifically for additional lenses. 
It also is worth remembering that pressing the shutter release is only half the photographer's job. Back in the days of traditional film stock the rest (or even the most) was done in the dark-room. So some decent photo editing software is just as important; Adobe Photoshop is of course very good but my own preference is for Corel Photopaint. 
Excellent value for money, I am very happy with my 400D (Rebel XTi).

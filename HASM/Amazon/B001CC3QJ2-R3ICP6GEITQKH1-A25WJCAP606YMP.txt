Title: Netbook Size with Full-size Laptop Performance!
Content:
I have owned a Asus EEE for several months and I love its size and simplicity, but eventually the performance limitations (i.e. disk size, processor speed) wore me down and left me wanting.  After researching several small-screen laptops (Flybook, Lifebook, Asus N010, & HP2310), I finally decided on the Lenovo U110.  I will add some photos to this review shortly.  
Pros:
Absolutely gorgeous style and look
Intel Duo Core power  
Ability to run Vista even if I choose to run XP
Small Footprint only 10% larger than the ASUS EEE
Solid, durable construction
Portable Optical Device (CD/DVD) included
Netbook size without compromise
Two batteries (1 large, 1 small) is great conveinience
Cons:
Defintiely Pricey, but you get what you pay for, I guess.
Glossy keyboard produces oily fingerprints (ala iPhone)
No SSD option  4200 rpm drive could be improved upon
Wished all of the keys were backlit and not just the media strip

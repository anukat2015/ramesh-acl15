Title: Pretty good computer
Content:
I've had the HP DV4-2161NR for a few weeks now. Super fast, no problem running multiple programs at once. The screen size is perfect, not too big and not too small, and the weight is perfect as well. The only problem I have with this laptop is the mouse pad area. I guess as with any laptop, the mouse seems to have a mind of it's own a lot. Sometimes the mouse won't even move at all when you are moving your finger on the pad. It jumps around and randomly selects things when you didn't want it to. I've noticed the same problem with my friends HP laptops as well.  This is the only problem I have had with the computer so far though. I would still recommend this computer to anybody who wants a good quality HP product.

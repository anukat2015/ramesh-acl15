Title: Best Amazon purchase EVER!  Best vacuum EVER!
Content:
I've had all types of vacuums from the dirt devils to bissel to beam to electrolux to kirby.  This by far is my favorite!  My only complaint is that the dirt cup is too small.  Granted, I should vacuum more often.
Don't buy this vacuum if . . . you don't like emptying dirt cups of bagless vacuums . . . you want to vacuum hardwood . . . you want to vacuum throw rugs.
What I love about it . . . the suction control - very powerful . . . good for steps & car - medium weight . . . great on longer carpet fibers . . . cord recoil is easy . . . just does a great job!
Some say it is heavy.  It isn't a super light weight.  Nor, is it very heavy.  I carry it as I vacuum the steps.  And, I ordered it on a Friday, which I received a great bargain!  Check it out!

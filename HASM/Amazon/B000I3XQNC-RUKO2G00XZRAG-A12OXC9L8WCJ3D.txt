Title: Amazingly User Friendly
Content:
After using a Canon EOS Rebel film SLR for more than 15 years I finally went digital in early January.  I purchased the Rebel XTi and have no regrets.  It has proven extremely easy to use for this first time digital camera user, and the pictures I am getting are great.  I'm very glad I chose to stick with Canon and would recommend the XTi without hesitation.

Title: A great gift for anyone
Content:
I recently bought this for my fiancee and she loves it. The sound quality is superb and the size allows it to be put anywhere. The only drawback and the reason i only gave it 4 stars is that you have to use iTunes. I'm a PC user and iTunes is a royal pain to get used to and is almost counter-intuitive at times. But other than that it was one of the few purchases i've been completely satisfied with.

Title: Just what I was lookin' for...
Content:
So... This happened to be the first thermostat I looked at online. I then spent an hour looking at several more. Ultimately, I decided on this one. I must say, this one was easy to install, is easy to use, and is worth those that cost twice as much. So, if you are looking for a programable thermostat (that does not need to be set up for a heat pump), this ones for you! :)

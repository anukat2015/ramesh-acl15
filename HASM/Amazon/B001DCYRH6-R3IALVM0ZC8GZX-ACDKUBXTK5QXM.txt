Title: replacing my 30 year old hoover portable
Content:
I have had my Hoover Portapower vacuum for 30 years now, YES- 30 years!  Still works great, but have had to use tape to hold the wands together ( connection finally wore out after 30 years)....and had replaced the cloth bag two years ago. WE USE THIS THING FOR EVERYTHING...from floors, to walls, to cars and furniture....you name, we have used it.  My oldest daughter tried to take it with her when she got married last year....caught her!  This thing is older than her!! She's 24, my vac is 30!  It still sucks as good as it did the day I bought it 30 years ago!  I am keeping my old one for the garage, but its time to get a new one for the house.....I wouldn't waste my hard earned money on any other brand.
Hoover is the only brand my parents used when I grew up, and that's all I have ever used.  Their quality speaks for themselves.  Looking forward to another great product from Hoover.  I will not get rid of the old Portapower, as it still works well...just retiring it to the garage and bringing in a new one for the house!

Title: Keurig B70
Content:
I did a lot of research and was actually reluctant about: 1) buying a single serve coffee maker (because I drink a lot of coffee) and 2) the price.  
I have had the B70 for about 2 months and I absolutely love it. It's easy to setup and use, makes great coffee and looks pretty cool too. 
I do tend to drink less coffee than I did but thats a good thing.
There are plenty of k-cup varieties and I also bought the reusable coffee filter.  that works well but being able to just throw out the used k-cup has made me a bit lazy even when it comes to rinsing out the coffee filter.
No complaints...go buy one...

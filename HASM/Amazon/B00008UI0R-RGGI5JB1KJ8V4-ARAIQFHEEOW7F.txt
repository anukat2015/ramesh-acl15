Title: Good vacuum - But needs care
Content:
We've had this vacuum for 10 months (empty nesters, no pets, 1500 sf home, cleaning service uses this vacuum).  It worked really well at the start, then after 9 months started to fade.  The problems are that 1) The belt needed to be changed on the powerhead and 2) The filter really needed to be replaced, washing, 'tho possible was not practical.  The local repair joint suggested changing both every three months (they wish!)  Once the belt and filter were changed the machine was back performing like a champ.  We'll replace them every six months...

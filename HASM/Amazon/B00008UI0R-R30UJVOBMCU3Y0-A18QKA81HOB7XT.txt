Title: Great vacuum for the money
Content:
This vacuum has great suction when it is on the highest setting and was much less expensive than comparable models. We read a lot of reviews and finally decided on this one and we're glad we did. It has all the basics (carpet attachment, hard floor attachment, crevice tools, etc.) and works very well. We were surprised to see how quickly the canister fills up, but glad to see we were getting our floors clean.

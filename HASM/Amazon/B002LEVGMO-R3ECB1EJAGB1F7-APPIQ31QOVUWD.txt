Title: If only it had a brain
Content:
Great bargain purchased over Thanksgiving from Amazon.  Unit arrived on schedule as promised by Amazon.  Disappointment started when unit arrived DOA and would not boot.  Tried fix listed on ACER web site - nothing.  Called ACER support after hunting for their number.  Reached India.  Tech walked me through the same fix from Web site eventhough I indicated that I had already done this fix.  Finally she concluded that it needed to be rebooted with emergency disk.  I kindly reminded her the unit did not have a disk drive.   After explaining this a couple of times she suggested that an external disk drive could be purchased at many electronics stores.  I was not in the mood to do ACER's job for them.   Called Amazon and the represenative was great...tried to find another unit however I knew they were sold out since I had tried to buy a second unit.   Amazon authorized free return shipment and credited my account after it arrived at their location.  This would have been a sweet deal.

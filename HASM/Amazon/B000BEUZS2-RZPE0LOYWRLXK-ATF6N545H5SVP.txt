Title: GREAT FOR PRICE
Content:
I bought this heater 2 years ago. For my laundry room to keep my dog and her 10 puppies warm through the cold winter. Warmed the room within 10 mins and if kept on high it was too DARN HOT! Best thing about this heater if the pups ever knoked it over it shut off. After two years of having this heater it hasn't failed me yet. And it has been thrown knocked over and stomped on by my dogs. Very Harty heater does a great job! Of and my laundry room has a dog door and windows all around so not very insulated. I would run it 6 hours a day every day and didn't even see a change in the pge bill

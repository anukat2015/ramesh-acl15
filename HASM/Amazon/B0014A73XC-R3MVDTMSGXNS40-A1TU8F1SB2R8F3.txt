Title: Great laptop and service from Amazon
Content:
I ordered this laptop with 2 day delivery and the delivery was right on time before I had to be out of town and wanted to take the computer with me.  I have an HP Pavillion Media Center Desk Top for almost 2 years and have been very happy with it, so it made sense to order another HP when I was searching for a laptop.  This laptop was by far the easiest computer to get set up and learn all the new features that I was not familiar with.  I also like the Artist version, which stands out when I am out with the laptop -- no chance of someone mistaking it for their's!  I am very pleased with my HP laptop, as well as Amazon.com's service.  The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is that the system is a bit slow to boot up -- but from that point on, it works very well.

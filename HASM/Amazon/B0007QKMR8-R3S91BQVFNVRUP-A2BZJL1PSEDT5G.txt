Title: Beautiful Picture / Fast Capture Speed
Content:
Both of our previous digital cameras (not SLRs) had a delay when taking pictures. This camera is the opposite of that. It takes pictures so fast that we no longer lose that special moment when trying to take a picture. The picture quality is superb and transferring images from the camera to our Mac is a mindless and fast operation. We're not great photographers, but this camera helps us make up for it. It's incredibly easy to use and the auto-focus works perfectly. The battery life is excellent too.

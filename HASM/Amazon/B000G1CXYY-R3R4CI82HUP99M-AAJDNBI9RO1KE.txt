Title: small but decent power
Content:
i was looking for something in this price range just to heat my small bedroom in the winter. when receiving it in the mail i was surprised at it's size (literally about 12 in x 12 in) but it puts out enough heat for my room. i find it takes only a few minutes to heat up the room. it's not the highest quality but will do the job for a while. works for me. and easy to store because of its size.

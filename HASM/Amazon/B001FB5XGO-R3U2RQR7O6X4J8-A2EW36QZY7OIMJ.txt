Title: Beware . . . heater leaks oil
Content:
I don't normally have to write an "onion" review for a product because I am very careful of about doing online research before buying a product, especially an appliance, white good, etc.
The original heater that we wanted to purchase was in fact a discontinued DeLonghi and as we already had one DeLonghi heater, we thought we would be safe to purchase this one.
That would be a no.
Within 4-5 days we noticed that we were getting some dark staining on our hardwood floors in the office.  I thought perhaps it was the old heater that was leaking, but come to find out, the new delonghi was slowly dripping oil on the floor from the bottom of one of the flanges.
It promptly went back to Amazon.com for a full refund.
my advice: I wouldn't risk it if I were you.  I've got stains on my floors that I can't remove.  I'd try another brand.

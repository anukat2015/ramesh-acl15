Title: Gr8 Little Vacuum
Content:
I just received my Hoover and tried it out.  Was amazed at how much dirt it picked up!  I thought my old Eureka was great, but this little guy picked up more dirt than my Eureka did in a month.  Will take a bit getting used to it, but I'm already very happy with it.

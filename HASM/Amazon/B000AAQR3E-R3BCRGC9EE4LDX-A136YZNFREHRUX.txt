Title: Absolutely worth it!
Content:
I've had a Bosch, a Sharp and an Oreck . None of those machines are even in the same class as the Miele. All the good things you've heard are true. This machine is small, quiet and incredibly powerful. My floors have NEVER been this clean. I didn't want to spend more than $500 and the quality of this machine leaves nothing to be desired. 
The only strange thing is that the onboard cleaning tools clip into a holder on the vacuum stem - it makes them more accessible, but the set up is slightly awkward. A minor point. It's a great vacuum. Don't hesitate.

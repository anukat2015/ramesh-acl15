Title: worse nightmare ever
Content:
I would give it zero star if I could. I have never wrote an review for any product in my life, but after today's terrible vacuum experience, I decided that I should do something to prevent anyone else from buying this vacuum cleaner.
First, it is super hard to clean, although they tell you on the manual how easy it is to clean it up, it actually causes more mass while cleaning and you ended up inhales tones of micro dust into your lungs. Second, its suction really sucks. It can't even pick up a single hair on bare floor when I switched it to lower floor mode. Third, it spits the dirt back to the floor when I was trying to lift it and moved it back to the carpet. Fourth, when you use the wand to clean the hard-to-reach corners, the bottom still keeps sucking on the floor, as a result of divided power, both ends lost suction. Fifth, approximately in two out of the five times I used it, after worked it out for about 10 to 15 minutes, it gets overheated or for whatever reason it just simply stopped working. The first time it happened which happened to be the first time I used it, I thought it was dead but I lost my receipt and was unable to return it and I stuck with this lemon ever since. It is an expensive machine and I don't have money to buy another one now, but I am afraid one day I might push it out of my window.

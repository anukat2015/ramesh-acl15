Title: Like a BMW, without the tailgating.
Content:
Like many good but expensive things you really have to try one of these to appreciate the difference.  Some years ago I couldn't justify the cost of a Miele so I bought a $400, top-of-the-line Eureka.  It did everything 80% of the way.  Got 80% of the dust, reached in 80% of the tight spaces...the cord even retracted 80% of the way.
If you're in the market for a Hoover, I'm sure it will do a decent job.  But if you only want to vacuum that stuff once, consider the Miele which does everything well and is amazingly quiet, too.  To quote Heidi Fleiss, "Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten."

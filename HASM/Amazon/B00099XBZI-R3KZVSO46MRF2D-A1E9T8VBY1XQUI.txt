Title: Nano (not plus) to replace an N200
Content:
I lost my N200. Purchased the Nano to replace.
I was happy with the N200, I'm happy with the Nano.
The headphones are the same. Will be replaced with $10 headphones.
The Nano doesn't have the rubber carrying case or the armband that came with the N200.  This is a bummer; I really wanted the case (still have the armband).
The nano has a microphone. I think the recording is a little better than the N200.  
It does not have FM tuner. Not a problem for me. The FM tuner on the N200 wasn't bad, but I'll use a mini radio if that's what I want.
It feels fragile...but I dropped the N200 enough to know that it isn't. The buttons have a different tactile feedback than the N200.

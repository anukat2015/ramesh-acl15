Title: Inexpensive, and works well
Content:
I have installed 2 programmable thermostats, this one and a Honeywell.
I installed the Honeywell in a circa 1950's house, and the Hunter in my girfriend's 2 year old house. 
Both have been dependable (approaching 2 years since installation) and easy to install (I'm a home repair moron). Because of the wide variety of ac's, furniture, heat pumps, make sure you read the instructions carefully.  
Neither of my installations had a heat pump, so they were relatively straightforward. (If I had a heat pump, I think I would have spent a bit more money and gotten one specifically for that...)
Advantages/Disadvantages-
Honeywell-Easier to program, more intuitive controls, THE name in household control. More Expensive (Paid around $50)
Hunter- More Features (Filter Replacement Reminder is nice), less expensive (around $25).  Controls are not as straightforward, but instructions are easily accessible on flip down face plate.
Bottom Line-Both will save you money.  I've seen a decrease of about 1/3 in my heating/cooling bills.

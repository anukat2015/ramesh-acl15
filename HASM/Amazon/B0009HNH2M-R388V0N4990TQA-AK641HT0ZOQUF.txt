Title: Lackluster performance
Content:
I purchased this as I had another Hoover cannister albeit a more expensive one that was an excellent machine. I cannot say the same about the Duros. It appears to have reasonable suction with the crevice tool and/or the step tool but it does not do a good job on carpets. I'm not sure why. I suspect the "powered" head is just poorly and/or cheaply designed. I usually end up using my older upright vaccum when I really want to clean my carpets. The Duros just isn't up to the task. It appears that $250 or $300 is needed to purchase a decent Hoover cannister.

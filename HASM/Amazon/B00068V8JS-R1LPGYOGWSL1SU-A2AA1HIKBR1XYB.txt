Title: Hit or Miss... Mostly Miss
Content:
Bought two of these which seemed to work fine for the first week or so. Call me crazy, but what company designs a product with an indicator light that stays on (green) regardless of the ON/OFF switch position? With the light staying on anytime the unit is plugged in, you can't actually tell if the switch position is in the 1000 watt, off, or 1500 watt position. Besides that marvel of engineering, both of our units have intermittent functionality, which means sometimes they work but most often they don't. As soon as I can get a customer service person to ok that I return these (at my expense, of course), they are going back to the company. My recommendation is to look elsewhere and stay away from this manufacturer.

Title: Superb Camera
Content:
This is a great camera. I read some of the lower star reviews just to see what some common complaints were. The most common one I saw was about the Auto Focus ...I have not had a single issue with the auto focus. All of my pictures have come out crisp and sharp. Now maybe those people are trying to use the auto focus in live mode, in that case then yes it wont work you have to manual focus in live mode..not really a big deal. 
Anyway great camera with lots of customization options. Has a bulb mode that will let the shutter stay open for extended periods of time but if you dont want to hold the button down you need a shutter remote.
Great camera. Buy it =)

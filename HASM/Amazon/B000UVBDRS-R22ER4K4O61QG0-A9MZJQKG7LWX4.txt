Title: Zen - you've done it
Content:
I have been on the look for a product like this for some time and finally Zen have hit the mark. 
An MP3 player with no hard drive that can play my non-purchased iTunes library without having to convert from AAC format. 
This player also has a memory slot for memory expansion. With SDHD heading up to 32gb I can bring the player up to 64gb capacity. Who needs a nano with this on offer.

Title: Best Portable Heater
Content:
I LOVE this heater. Truly one of my best purchases. I have two - one for home and one for the office. It puts out more heat than you would expect and it's very quiet. Once you pick a temperature and level of heat (low or high) you can use the remote to simply turn it on and off and it will be at your favorite setting right away. It makes the room feel nice and cozy and it's so quiet that I don't realize it is on. I've had several portable heaters over the years and nothing is better than this one. Bought another one as a gift today on Amazon since a relative saw mine and loved it too. 
The size and style makes it very sleek and I never dread having to take it out each year. Another plus is that I can direct it to warm just my area if I wish since my husband doesn't like too much heat- this way we are both happy! I read the other reviews and was surprised to see a few disappointed people. Some mentioned popping noises and other defects. I NEVER experienced these things and it seems there may have been a defective lot out there, unfortunately. The positive reviews were right on the money though and made me smile because I feel the same way those customers do.

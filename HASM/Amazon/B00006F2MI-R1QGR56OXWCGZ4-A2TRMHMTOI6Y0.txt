Content:
I purchased one for my daughter and it was the worst purchase I ever made.  The cafe leaked when pouring & the grinder basket is almost impossible to remove.  I purchased one for myself & it is totally different.  Does not leak when pouring & the grinder basket is easily removed.  Did Cuisinart improve it or did I just get a "lemon" the first purchase?

Title: Quirky but works well
Content:
Having exhausted my Samsung ultra-light vac, I decided to try this one ... It was easy to assemble in minutes. I used it before allowing our cleaning person to use it and was amazed at how much dust and dirt it discovered on our relatively clean floors.  I took it over rug fringe w/o the power-mate on and it started to eat it (not good) and I can't image the damage it would do with the power-mate on.... so bewarned on that. The cleaning folks had no problems using it - so that is good.

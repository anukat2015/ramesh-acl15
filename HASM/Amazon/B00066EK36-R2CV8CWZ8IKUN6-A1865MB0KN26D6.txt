Title: Excelent product with a minor nuisance
Content:
I gota' tell ya', for the price it is absolutely worth owning, especially if it's your first mp3 player. I couldn't be happier with it: the display is great, it's very light, and it has many features. 
Some people have complained that it's a bit too difficult to use. True, but after a couple of rounds of forward and backward any user will get the jest of the most important functions. Programming the FM player gets a bit confusing but it's doable. 
It's really a pleasant surprise as how many features are put in this product; it's actually fun trying to figure them all out. Although the manual is not very helpful, you can figure it out for yourself. 
You can organize your mp3s or wmas any way you like. Maneuvering through your folders and files is also easy. The FM radio has 20 preset stations that you can program, the signal is not great but it works. The mic picks up conversation from almost 2 feet away. Just a good product. 
The only downfall is the immense consumption of batteries. I go through 4 batteries a week!! I know the company promises 15 hours of play time, but this is misleading because it uses a lot of juice when you're transferring songs to the player from your pc (or Mac). Now, I only transfer songs sporadically, to deter some of the battery usage. I also figured out you can turn off the backlight, which also saves some juice.
Overall, I'm happy with it. Keep in mind I haven't experienced any other mp3 players, but objectively I think it's wonderful. Enjoy.
In My Humble Opinion

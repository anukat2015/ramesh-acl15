Title: Saved our vacation
Content:
For our 25th wedding anniversary we spent a week on the south shore of Kauai (Hawaii).  Even in November the temperature and humidity gave me second thoughts when we first saw our condo.  Great location, great amenities, no A/C.
I can take humidity during the day, but at night I love to sleep in a cool and dry environment.  I was curious to note that in the bedroom closet there was a Sharp air conditioner unit; I was of course familiar with conventional a/c and window a/c, but not this type.  Okay, even without a manual it didn't take long to figure out how to turn the thing on, adjust the louvers (motorized), set the temperature, and so forth.
All I can say is, WOW!  After 30 minutes the bedroom was as frosty as I wanted, and dry!  The device was very quiet and the exhaust hose connecting to a wall vent was hot to the touch, demonstrating all the heat extracted from the room.  We had 6 wonderful days (and nights) in that unit, thanks in part to the portable a/c machine.
I have no familiarity with the reliability of the unit or what it did with the condensate (we must have taken gallons of water out of the air) but it worked beautifully for us.  Highly recommended.

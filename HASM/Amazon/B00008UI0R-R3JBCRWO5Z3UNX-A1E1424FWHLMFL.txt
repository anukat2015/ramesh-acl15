Title: pretty darn good
Content:
I really do like this vacuum - have gotten more dirt and gunk than i ever thought possible out of my rugs.  Agree with previous reviewers - wish there was a place on the vacuum to hold the little stair/cloth attachment.  Also I have lots of wood floors and it doesn't seem to suck up as well as on rugs, but it does a good job.  Glad i got it!

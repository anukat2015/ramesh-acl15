Title: Top of Thermal Carafe is DISGUSTING!
Content:
I am not sure who desgined the lid on this pot, but they were insane.  It must hold a full cup of coffee in it and it is impossible to clean, resulting in it building up little bits of gunk inside it.  I have had this pot for well over a year.  It has held up ok.  The coffee is not too hot in the carafe, but it works.  Everything else functioned ok.  The carafe is a little difficult to clean as well.  But this whole lid thing is disgusting!  We noticed that it was hard to pour last week, and was really not functional at all by yesterday.  I tried to clean it out last night and a TON of black gross possibly plastic gunk came out of the lid.  I rinse the lid out EVERY NIGHT but I guess this has been building up in there.  The pot is being replaced immediately.  Just gross.

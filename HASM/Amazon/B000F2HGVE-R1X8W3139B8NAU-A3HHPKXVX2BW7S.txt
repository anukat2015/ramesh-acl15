Title: It's designed to "leak"
Content:
My machine "leaks" as well, however since I move it forward on the counter to put the water tank in, I have seen the water when I slide it back and not been unknowingly wetting my counter like others. I searched "delonghi bco-120t leaking" and I got this product page. I read 3 pages of reviews and then inspected the unit closely. It is designed to drain water from the compartment where the tank goes through a hole in the corner. I personally think the design should NOT have included a hole. That would allow you to use the tank as a convenience for easy filling, but ALSO allow you to just fill the compartment up in the event you prefer to, or crack/lose etc... the tank. I tried a few test brews of just water and have found the most likely reason for water getting to that drain hole is "user error."  The tank needs to fit into the bottom quickly and tightly. If it is lightly pressed down, it might leak out into the compartment, and consequently out the drain hole onto the counter. 
Just push it down nice and tightly and hopefully you'll be ok.
The carafe does seem thinner and broke after dropping a fork into a full of water carafe in the sink. $27 to replace from gourmet dot com I think.

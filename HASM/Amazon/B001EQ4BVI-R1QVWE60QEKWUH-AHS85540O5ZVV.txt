Title: Very happy with this baby!
Content:
My wife has been an amature photographer for 15 yrs and i bought this camera for her to replace her old 10D. It's day and night in comparison. Amazing picture quality, easy menu and you can actually use the LCD to frame your shot for quick party shots, etc. Love the two RAW formats, too - RAW and RAW jpeg. The LCD screen is big, bright and super crisp.

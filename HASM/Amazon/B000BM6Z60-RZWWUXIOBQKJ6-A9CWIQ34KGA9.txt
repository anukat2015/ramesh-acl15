Title: So far so good!
Content:
So far I really like my new creative zen player. It's been fairly easy to use - I was worried because I haven't had much experience with any mp3 players, but despite my lack of technical abilities I was able to figure out how to download songs and use it for the purposes I need. I like that it is about the size and weight of a cell phone since I am mostly using it to work-out. I have noticed that there aren't too many great options for armbands, but I did a fairly decent armband at bestbuy - the only problem is it isn't that secure to run in, so I am still in search of a better armband for more intense exercise. Also, it is really hard to read the screen in the sun. However, these are only minor problems... so far it's been great!

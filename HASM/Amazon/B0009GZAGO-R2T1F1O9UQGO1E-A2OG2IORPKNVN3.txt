Title: Great Camera but had problems with Amazon as supplier
Content:
I ordered this camera from Amazon, got it and started snapping away right off the bat. It's a great camera but when I went to recharge the battery I found that the cord wasn't a domestic US cord. I emailed Amazon, they said call Nikon. I called Nikon and they said it's a grey market camera and they may not be able to support it. 
They have suggested I send them the cable and they will look into replacing it but made no promises. I know the cable is easy to replace on my own but now I'm worried that if the camera itself has problems down the line Nikon will refuse to support it.

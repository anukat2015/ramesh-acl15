Title: Best Laptop I've worked on yet.
Content:
I LOVE this laptop.  I have both worked on and owned several brands and types of laptops.  This is by far the best one yet.  I know this sounds silly but after owning (and constantly cleaning) stainless steel appliances the thing that caught my attention on this laptop was the 'non-fingerprint' finish and the keyboard touch.  I have owned the laptop for about a month now without any issues whatsoever.  I have owned more expensive (and heavier) laptops in the past.  For the price and size this baby delivers.

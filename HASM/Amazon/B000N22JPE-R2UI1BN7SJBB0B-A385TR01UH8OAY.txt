Title: a nice  coffeemaker
Content:
this a nice looking machine, easy to use and to program, and it makes very good cups of hot coffee. However, I don't understand why they don't make the top of carafe glass attached. I took out of the top many times and forgot to put it back
on, end up making a pot of undrinkable coffee. in addition, another inferfect for this machine is that have to use replacement water filter.

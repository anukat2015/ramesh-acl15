Title: Great heater for the price
Content:
This heater is terrific! The remote is easy to use, and I like that there is an audible beep every time I use the remote to change a setting. 
As for energy cost, I use it in my basement office in my home for 3 hours a day Monday through Friday, and that costs me approx $5 a month (I checked with an energy meter).
My only qualm is that it's a little noisier than I had expected, given other reviews that called it quiet.

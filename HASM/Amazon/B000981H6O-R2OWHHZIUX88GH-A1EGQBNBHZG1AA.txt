Title: Best Cleaner.
Content:
This is a great product. I recommend everyone should keep one at home. It easily cleans up any kind of mess. Dry, dust or liquid. You can let your kid play and make any mess all he or she wants to their hearts fill and then when they are sleeping or napping you can clean up the mess in seconds with not much effort. This is a life saver in all cleaning aspects. I have 4. 2 for me, 2 I gifted. I have been using hoover hand vacs for the last 2.5 yrs and my life has been easy with this around.
Ladies men can also equally participate in clean ups with this. So no excuses for men. Get going and buy this if you have toddlers who make messes. The air-suction in this sucks all the dirt right into a cup. If you need something from the mess/dirt your toddler threw into. You can get it right back with this.

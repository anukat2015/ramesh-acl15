Title: simply great!
Content:
i spent weeks reviewing the canon rebel xt and nikon d70s. often shuffling and swaying towards either, till i finally made the choice based on the capability of the rebl xt to shoot in bw mode. and its been just awesome.if u like to click in bw, go for the rebel without further thoughts (thats comparing it with the nikon) the option of using the filters and further changing them in post processing lets u get a hang of exactly how colors vary with each filter. also the gr8 part is that the image being in raw can still be convereted to color if you want!
i m impressed!

Title: great for wood floors and dog hair
Content:
This is great in a house with mostly hardwood floors and a few throw rugs.  We have 3 English Setters who always leave their long white hairs around.  This is so much better than the upright we used.  It is easier to move around and to get under the tables.  We kept the upright to do the indoor/outdoor carpet on the large deck and the carpeted stairs and ramp to the house.  Was surprised at large the replaceable bag.  Not ideal for everything, but works better for us than the upright.

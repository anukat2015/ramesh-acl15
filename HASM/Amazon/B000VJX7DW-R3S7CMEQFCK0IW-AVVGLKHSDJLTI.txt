Title: What an Amazing Camera
Content:
Have had this camera for 4 months now and have taken over 11,000 photos so far, and counting.  As many other people have already mentioned it is a great camera and well worth the 5 star average rating.[...].  3200 ISO allows even dimly lit photos to be useful.  A beautiful 3 inch LCD that will be much sharper than your computer, which can be acutually a drawback because some photos look great on the LCD but less sharp on my computer when downloaded.  But I'm also learning better technique, so I can't blame the camera too much for that.  The other drawbacks include I'm taking so many photos with this great camera that I'm quickly running out of memory on the 4 GB Compact Flash card and have to buy multiple cards now.  I've also had to buy multiple external hard drives to backup and store all my photos.  I can get about 321 photos on the Large & Fine Jpeg settings.  The battery life is also amazing. I can easily get close to 1000 photos and constant LCD reviews of my photos on just a single charge.  It's always nice to have a backup battery but I've never had to change it in the field yet.  I use this camera with my Nikon 18-200mm, Sigma 10-20mm, and Nikon 50mm f/1.8.  The only regrets......I didn't get this camera earlier, I missed the opening ship date by about 2 weeks :-)  Hope this helps.  You deserve a reward, go buy it from Amazon.com where I did.

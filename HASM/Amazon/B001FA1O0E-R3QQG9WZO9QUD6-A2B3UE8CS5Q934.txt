Title: Do NOT buy if you reside in a Humid climate or use it to Work-Out
Content:
I was very excited to purchase my Ipod touch and really loved all the features. It really does do everything.  I even purchased the Nike + for it and with an arm band, and silicone case, used to it work out. About 4 months after purchase, the on/off button stopped resonding, then the wi-fi stopped working, then my Nike + was not recognized. I called Apple and they promptly sent me a box to ship it back to them for repair. I was advised by Apple the next day that my Ipod had water damage?? And it was being shipped back to me unrepaired as this was not covered by their warranty.  I never got the thing wet!  I never took it in the rain!  The only thing I can think of was sweat from when I worked out and/or humidity.  I did a little research on line and found out that the water sensor can be tripped very easily by both humidity and as little as a speck of water, rendering your ipod full of problems.  You would think that since this Ipod has the built in Nike+ feature and is suppose to be great to work out with, it could withstand some sweat or humidity. I do live in MI and we do get humid weather here on certain days.  I am very disappointed in this product and find it to be extremely flimsy. I spent $369 on a product 4 months ago that I am now going to have to have repaired at some ridiculous price!  Apple customer service was not very helpful and made me feel like I was lying to them!  While I love the design and all the capabilities of the Ipod Touch, I think Apple needs to rethink its durability design.

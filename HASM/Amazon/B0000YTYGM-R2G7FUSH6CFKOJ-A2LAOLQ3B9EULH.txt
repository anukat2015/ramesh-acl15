Title: Keeps Coffee Hot for Four Hours Plus
Content:
My main concern in looking at stainless steel carafe coffee makers was whether the coffee would brew hot and stay hot. This Cuisinart is exceptional on both counts. I had tried a Mr Coffee stainless steel carafe coffee maker which failed miserably at keeping the coffee hot (among other problems with clogging and leaking). This Cuisinart brews 12 cups (most stainless carafe makers are 10 cups only) in about 5 minutes. Four hours later, it's still very hot.
Complaints by other reviewers about the Cuisinart spilling and overflowing are more properly directed at the human operator than the coffee maker. This coffee maker does require one to pay attention to how to properly secure the carafe lid and to insure that over-filling with water  doesn't cause coffee grounds to float out over the top of the basket. But if you exercise some thought and care while using this coffee maker, you will have no problems. It has a very nice appearance, as well. After having tried a wide variety of coffee makers over the years, I highly recommended this Cuisinart. It is the best coffee maker that I have ever owned.

Title: Almost too good to give away
Content:
I bought this nano as a gift for my granddaughter (12), and only had it for a very short time. As such this review will be short.
I wanted to ensure that the battery was charged when she got it, so I plugged it into my computer when I got it. iTunes popped up and loaded all of my music onto her ipod. I'm sure that she has since deleted at least most of it.
There are very few controls, so that means that doing what you want is actually more complicated. If you've never had one before, going online for the instructions is a must. This thing has incredible technology built into, so I'm very impressed.
After playing with this for an hour or two, I really didn't want to gift it, but I did. She, of course loved it, and I'm sure that she is currently enjoying it.

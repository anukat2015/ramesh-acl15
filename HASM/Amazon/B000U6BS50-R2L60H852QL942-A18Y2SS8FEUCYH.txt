Title: devil doesn't deliver
Content:
While I like the color and convenience of this product, it does not pick up well nor easily. I have to keep going over the same area and sometime get the old standby broom to finish the job.  One of the brushes keeps falling off during use. It is easy to empty which is the most I can say for it. I would neither recommend it nor purchase another.

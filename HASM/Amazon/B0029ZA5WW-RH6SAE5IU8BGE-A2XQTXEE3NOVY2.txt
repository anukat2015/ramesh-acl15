Title: Stay Clear !! of this item
Content:
I bought it with one day shipping to my house and that was the best thing that I received, TY Amazon. When I got it the 1st problem I had was with connecting with the wireless router from Linksys that I had to pay a $9.99 fee for tech support. It took 3 - 4 hours to get it working. Then I had problems running videos from Apple with Quicktime and Youtube with flash. Then I ran City of Heroes that worked fine on it to my surprise. The next morning I started up the computer with a nasty blue screen and a system failure message that dump all system memory as well. The computer then put me in safe mode that now video was able to work ??? I called HP about my problems with the blue screen and video problems he instructed me to do a full system recovery on my day old computer. The computer, after reinstall, came up and seemed to work then the HP tech told me to reboot the computer for updates. The computer then got stuck in a system loop and now safe mode couldn't work now. He then told me he needed me to call a senior tech in which I had to call back at a different number, after 1 1/2 of being on hold enough was enough.  HP tech had me on the phone for 5 hours. I bought computers in the pass but between system problems on a day old computer and terrible HP tech service I sent the computer HP Pavilion DV7-2170US 17.3-Inch Entertainment Laptopback for a full refund.

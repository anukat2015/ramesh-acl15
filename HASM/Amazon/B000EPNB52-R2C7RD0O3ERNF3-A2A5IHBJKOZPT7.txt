Title: good but expensive
Content:
It is a great product, but there are other products in the market at a lower price with more features. Nevertheless the reason to buy an iPod is that in some senses Apple behaves like a monopoly. They have a very successful product that dominates the market, tied with the music store. Music that you buy on iTunes may or may not be usable in other devices. Apple also controls prices very tightly, without giving much leeway to retailers to discount the device.
Q: Why can't you see videos in this iPod? A: Because as a monopoly they select the features they want to include in the different products so that you have to buy more expensive stuff.
Why don't they include an FM tuner?

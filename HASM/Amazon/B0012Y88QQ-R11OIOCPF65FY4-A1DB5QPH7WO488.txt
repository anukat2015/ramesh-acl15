Title: GREAT digital camera - still holds up well against newer models
Content:
The XSi is a great digital body, and should probably be bought that way (i.e., without a lens), so that you can save the money you would have spent on a barely-adequate kit lens to put towards something far better, such as the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens.  While this Rebel has been superceded by the newer Canon EOS Rebel T1i, this model still provides excellent bang for the buck, and even exceeds the performance of the T1i in some respects.
Others have written at length and in great detail about the features and performance of this camera, so I'll just touch on a few highlights and some important distinctions between this and the newer model, the T1i.  This model uses the same size digital sensor (APS-C) with fewer megapixels than the newer body.  This fact, together with the less agressive noise-reduction implemented by the older DIGIC III processor in this camera, means that the XSi can provide lower noise in lower-light situations than the T1i, while still providing more than enough pixels to print even cropped sections of your photos up to 11x14.
By foregoing the video recording mode, DIGIC IV processor and high-resolution screen found on the T1i, the XSi body leaves more room in your budget for some important accessories, such as the 17-55 f/2.8 lens mentioned above, and one of the must-have Speedlite flashes, such as the top-of-the-line Canon Speedlite 580EX II or the still-very-much-worth-having Canon Speedlite 430EX II.
Basically, if you want a compact digital camera body that accepts EF-S lenses and don't want to blow your whole budget before you even get to buy a lens or a flash, the XSi is right in the sweet spot of great performance for a reasonable price.

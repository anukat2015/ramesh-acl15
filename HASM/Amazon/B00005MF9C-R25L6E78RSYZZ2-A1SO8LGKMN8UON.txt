Title: black and decker brew 'n go coffee maker
Content:
I bought this as a gift because I've used the same coffee maker for years.  I have one in my summer home, along with the one I have in my year round home.  It's great because I do not have to have extra cups of coffee sitting around in a carafe, getting stronger every minute.  I am the sole coffee drinker in my home and just brew a cup for each meal.  After several years I find it begins leaking from underneath and I must mop up after it after each cup brewed.  But it's swift and efficient.  I recommend it for anyone who finds a practical use for it.

Title: Flimsy Construction
Content:
I just returned this machine for a refund; after four weeks the hose that connects into the machine seperated from the plastic coupling, which frankly, shocked me as it had been treated gently.  There are electrical connections within the hose that were exposed and the power head no longer worked.  Not worth repairing, was relieved I was able to return it.  Replaced with a bagless Bissell upright that seems a lot sturdier.

Title: Great little heater but be CAREFUL!
Content:
It's simple enough for an 87-year-old who suffers from the cold (and dementia) to use in the master suite. It keeps him and the entire suite warm, and we don't have to run the thermostat nearly as high anymore. It's fairly quiet, and there are no disturbing lights to disturb his sleep. It was shipped quickly and arrived well packed. We are very pleased with the purchase experience, product and delivery service. 
Two months after this initial review we had an outlet fire without any warning. The electrician who came to repair the outlet said that because this heater pulls as many amps as it does that it should only be plugged into outlets wired to handle such an output, as those found typically in a kitchen or bathroom. It does work well, but be careful where you plug this in! We were just lucky!

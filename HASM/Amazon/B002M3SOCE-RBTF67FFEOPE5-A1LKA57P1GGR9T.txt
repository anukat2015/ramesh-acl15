Title: Love It!
Content:
I purchased my ipod specifically to use the Kindle app to read books while away from home.. and was thrilled with the many other uses for my ipod touch! I purchased a 32gb and I recommend at least that size. Mine is nowhere near being full but I feel like I have plenty of room to add music, movies, books, etc without hitting the limit.
I can't imagine not having one now... I use it constantly - checking online banking, email, playing games, reading. It's great for traveling, basically a little pocket computer. I was hesitant to spend the money on it at first but I have to say it is definitely worth it. I looked into getting a netbook but I love this because it just slides into my purse and consolidates my music, books, etc...
I give it 5 stars!

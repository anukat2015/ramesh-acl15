Title: Toasty Toes? Yes!
Content:
I did a lot of research before purchasing this footrest with my Social Security dollars. There are less expensive heated footrests on the market, but I think the Toasty Toes footrest must rank toward the top of them.  Unlike the less expensive units, it has no fan to make noise and wear out, and the temperature of the surface seems to be just about right.  I have not used it vertically so I can't address how it works in that position.
My Minnesota office is in the NW corner of our house and my computer is against an outside wall.  That means when winter winds blow I am in the chilliest part of our house.  I'm 66-years-old, and as many my men my age, I'm chilly during winters, and my cold feet exacerbated that.  [Grandma, on the other hand is always too warm, but I can't convince her to lie under my desk so I can use her as a footrest.]
My feet are now toasty warm and I don't dislike Minnesota winters as much as I did in the past!

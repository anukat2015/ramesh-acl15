Title: It's ok
Content:
I think most people decide to go with a DSLR because they've got a friend with one that takes fantastic pictures and they want to get that themselves.  I knew going in that I would have to learn how to use it.  I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.  I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.  I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.  The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF.  I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.  I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90.  I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)  It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.

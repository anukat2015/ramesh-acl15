Title: Wasn't expecting how great it is!
Content:
We have leased a two-story townhouse.  We call the upstairs the Sahara and the downstairs Antartica.  Heat rises up, so no matter what temp we turned the central on, the upstairs got hot, the downstairs.... ehhh.   So we got one of these for our living room and come downstairs in the morning and turn it on.  It makes a major difference.  We *love* it.  My dad's wall heater went out so we brought him this until the new one came (2 days later) and had to fight to get it back.  :)  We bought him one online and it should be delivered next week.  He (like us) liked the silence, the osccilation, the temp control... everything.  And we're not heating just a bedroom, we're heating a big living room.  It makes a world of difference.  Love everything about it.  Remote control way cool when you're sitting down and think ya wouldn't mind having it a tad warmer around you.  I've read the other reviews, we haven't had "cord" heating troubles.  Just warmth and with the osccilation, it isn't just blowing one direction, it's spreading the warmth all around.

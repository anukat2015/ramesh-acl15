Title: My best computer yet.
Content:
The model I have is a CW29X. The options I chose when ordering from SonyStyle include the brand new Core i5 540m CPU, and 6GB of DDR-3 RAM. I know I paid a pretty penny, but the computer is great. 
With the extended battery, I can get over 5 hours of web surfing. With the added SSD, Windows 7 takes seconds to boot. The WIFI picks up more signals then other computers in the house. With HDMI, it is easy to watch movies or play games on your big screen TV!
The keyboard is very nice, and the over all design is great. The speakers sound okay, the screen is very sharp, and the computer does not get very hot unless I play the newest of games on the highest settings! I ordered this computer before they were being shipped, and so I probably had the fastest computer in town for a little while! Windows shows 4 CPUS in task manager.
Being 14", it is almost like my wifes 1525 Dell laptop, but a bit more compact. It is very light and a pleasure to carry around. I am quite computer savvy, and this computer fits all my needs very well. I was considering a Core i7 Vaio, but it was a thousand bucks more for the model I was looking at.

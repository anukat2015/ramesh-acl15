Title: Not recommended
Content:
Worked ok in the first 3 months I had it, although the suction was not what I expected. Now, even with a new bag and nothing blocking the hose, it will not pick up anything. You go over the same spot multiple times and nothing happens - even on bare hardwood floors. Have taken to vacuuming without the stick.  Looking for a new vac.

Title: Wouldnt buy another.....
Content:
I just moved to Vegas. When I lived at home with my parents, my brother and I bought this vacuum for my mother because she needed a new one. At first, we were very skeptical that this was not going to suck good on the different carpets we had and MAN IT DOES!!! I have a cat here in my apartment, and this Vacuum even picks up the little things that get embedded in the carpet! When I first moved here i bought a $100 vacuum from walmart, but donated that and purchased this! I would highly recommend this vacuum!!!! ( for small spaces, my apartment, and large spaces, my parents house)

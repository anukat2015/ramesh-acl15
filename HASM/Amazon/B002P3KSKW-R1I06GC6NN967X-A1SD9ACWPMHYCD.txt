Title: The best laptop I've owned, period.
Content:
I've owned 7 laptops from Toshiba, Dell, HP, and a few others over the last 12 years and this one is the best I have owned by far. The battery life is outstanding however not the 8 hours Acer advertises. It averages closer to 5 hours which is still excellent. Performance wise, it is only average but its light weight and the advantage of not worrying about running out of power while working away from an outlet more than make up for it. I have only had this laptop for a week but I am very happy with my purchase. Being the best laptop I have owned to date, it makes me smile to know that it has also been the least expensive. I recommend it wholeheartedly. I bought my wife an Acer netbook last X-mas and she loved it so I gave Acer a try when it came time to replace my Dell. My only problem now is my wife now wants my Timeline laptop because it is as slim as her netbook but with a bigger screen.

Apple iPod touch 16 GB (2nd Generation) NEWEST MODEL
I did not think I would want an iPod Touch.  I have an iPod Nano and use it only occasionally.  However, I went to Apple just to see what it was, and decided I HAD to have one because it was so cool.  I have not been disappointed.  Other than take pictures and make phone calls (get an iPhone if you want that and want to be stuck with AT&T as your only choice for a carrier), this thing is limitless in what it can do.  I love it and have to say that it is probably one of the most innovative electronic gadgets to come out in years.  I use it to listen to music, but I have downloaded some fantastic free programs that help me lose weight as well as let me know menus from many restaurants so that I can make informed decisions when eating out.  A program that I bought (most programs are no more than $2.99 and most are less)is a very accurate pedometer.  It tells me the distance I walked, how many steps I have taken, and how many calories I burned.
I have played games, and I have to tell you that the graphics are unbelievable.  Also, you can easily surf the web as long as you have an internet connection available...FREE...no other subscriptions.  It is so light and thin that you sometimes wonder if you dropped it somewhere.  This is truly one of the greatest "toys", and it is so easy to use.  I highly recommend this!

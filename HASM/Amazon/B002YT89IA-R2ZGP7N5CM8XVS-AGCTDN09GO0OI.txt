Title: Great Sony VAIO
Content:
Although this laptop is a bit more expensive than some of the others, I really like the chiclet keyboard, and the HDMI port is great to hook up the laptop to my LCD TV (there's a special button to turn off the computer display when I'm using the TV as a monitor). I don't regret this purchase at all.

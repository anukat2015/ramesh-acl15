Title: AWESOME!
Content:
I just received this laptop yesterday after doing extensive research.  You can't touch this laptop with the same specs anywhere for this price.  PLUS, this is a GREAT looking laptop - I just love it.  The keyboard is like a pearly white and the graphics on the front are awesome.  I am definately a person who doesn't like "cookie cutter" things - so this was right up my alley.  I know that these types of graphics aren't for everyone, but I absolutely am blown away.  Now for the good part!  This laptop has amazing speed.  It was up and running in about 15 minutes - right out of the box.  I just love my new laptop and am extremely pleased!

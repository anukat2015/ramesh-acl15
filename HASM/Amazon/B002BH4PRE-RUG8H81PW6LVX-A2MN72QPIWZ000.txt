Title: Good Laptop
Content:
Like this product. Not that it is really awesome.. but good.... apart from a few HP softwares that fail to work... the rest has been an awesome experience so far. The media remote is the best thing about this system... enjoy your music while roaming around the room... graphics is also good.. not as good as ATI... but better than the rest of the NVIDIA line-up. Sound quality is better than Dell... The numpad makes playing games easier, and good to have if you are looking for a big screen desktop replacement.

Title: This is the nausea gas generator !
Content:
I buied this heater 1 month ago, I can not use this heater because of the bad smell. The bad smell gives off when 1500W or 900W is activated with 5~6 level of the dial. With the low level of the dial like 3, my room is not worm at the case of 900W. 
Somebody said that after 4 hours in use, the bad gas does not give off.
So, I turned on the heater for 4 hours continuously 5 times.
Total 20 hours are gone!
The bad small does not reduced. Whenever I turned on the heater with more than 900W (dial 6 level), the bad smell camed out again.
The degree of the nausea gas is so strong!
In the room, I can not breath due to the gas.
I spend my time and money to use the heater comfortably.
But the heater does not work correctly. 
Only my heater has the problem?
This is the nausea gas generator !
I am so unhappy !

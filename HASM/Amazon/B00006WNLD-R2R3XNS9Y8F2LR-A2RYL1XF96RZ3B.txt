Title: Perfect for small countertops
Content:
I really like this coffee maker.  It's so easy to use, and I love no brainers.  It took me a while to figure out exactly how much coffee to use but once I got that down I can quickly make my coffee, even if im half asleep.  Nice product.  I definatly recommend the paper filters though, that permanant filter lets alot of drudge through, thus the 4 stars.  If that filter worked better it would be a 5 star.  Or you could get fresh ground and make sure not to grind too fine.

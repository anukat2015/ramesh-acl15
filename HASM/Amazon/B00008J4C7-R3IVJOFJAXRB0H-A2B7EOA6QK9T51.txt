Title: If you have carpet or pets do not buy this vacuum
Content:
I bought the roadster because of the power nozzle since I have carpet and a dog.  It is the worst vacuum I have ever owned.  I clean out the filter several times while I am sweeping and wash it after every use and it still barely picks up anything. If you want a canister vacuum with a power nozzle you are better off spending the extra money and buy a real quality vacuum.  I wrote to the company and told them how disappointed I was with their vacuum and have yet to hear from them.  It is nice to know they stand behind their product.

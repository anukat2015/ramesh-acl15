Title: I was freezing in the North East
Content:
I would highly recommend this heater. Prior to this purchase, I owned a Pelonis oil-filled heater that looks like a radiator - it broke down in less than a year and was far to costly to have repaired - what a piece of junk. Anyway, the Bionaire heat is magnificent. Its not very noisy at all, heats the room very quickly, and the twisting position system is quite effective. For instance, it took about 20 min to heat a room 10'x12' several degrees, whereas my old oil-filled heater took 30 min just to get warm and another hour to raise the temperature just 1-2 degrees (using the same amount of power). I am very pleased at my purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an excellent heater.

Title: My Radiators are finally free of dust
Content:
If you look carefully at the pictures, there are actually two or three different items depicted. One is a 2.5 ft brush made of white plastic, the other two show a metal one that is perhaps longer and skinnier. I received the 2.5 ft white plastic one.
I have old metal radiators in our brownstone apartment. This works better than anything else I have tried to get the dust out. It condenses down enough to slide in (at least from the top, it isn't skinny enough to get in from the sides), but it is 'bushy' enough to expand into the open slots as it goes down and knock the dust out.
I'm a little worried about the durability (the wire near the handle is already getting a bit too flexible after one round of cleaning 5 radiators), but honestly, I was desperate enough that I would have paid this price even if I had known the brush wouldn't last forever.
The dust comes off the brush easily enough when you wash it.

Title: Keurig Coffee Maker
Content:
I LOVE Keurig coffee machines, and have had the B-50, B-60 and B-70 units. All work equally well, although I prefer the B-70 as it holds  more water. Each cup of coffee or tea is just perfectly made. This, with the speed of preparation and virtually no clean-up, makes Keurig my favorite coffee machine. You will love it too.

Title: Will Shop here again
Content:
Good Price Good Shipping information and tracking. No Problems. 
Received as advertised.
Good starter camera, Light weight, decent lens in kit. Enough bells and whistles to wow the beginner and carry you into quality photography. Also looked at 40D but it is heavier and more complex than I needed to start with.

Title: Fantastic mobility and speed
Content:
This laptop is amazing.  It's way faster than a netbook, and just as mobile.  It's whisper quiet.  The battery life is incredible- close to 10 hours based on my usage.  The only possible downside is that the glossy finish is easily smudged with fingerprints.
I'm also very impressed by windows 7 home premium- very speedy and several UI improvements over windows XP.

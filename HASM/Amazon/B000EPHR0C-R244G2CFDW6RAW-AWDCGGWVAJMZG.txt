Title: An Outstanding MP3 Player with limited competition
Content:
I tried so hard to resist converting into an Ipod user, but alas, my Creative Zen broke down and I refused to pay $200 to repair. I purchased the 80GB, black Ipod (generation 5) around Novemeber 2006 and I have had no regrets about. So far I got almost 4000 songs and I still have tons of room left
(+) Great battery life; nice, vibrant colors on screen; easy to use
(-) no external battery; no external AC adapter  
I would recommend purchasing a sturdy protective case to protect your expensive investment, along with an external AC adapter

Title: Great camera
Content:
I will admit I am a long time Canon fan.  I remember my first SLR as a canon and I have never myself left the brand.  I have played with plenty of Nikon's out there and they are good camera's but for myself it will always be canon.  That being said....
Canon's 40D is a great camera.  I am still learning how to use all of it's features but so far the pictures have been coming out great.  I will say a few features I haven't yet mastered are the white balance( I seem to have better luck manually setting it than leaving it to auto ), and I haven't really settled on how to best use the custom shooting profiles 1, 2, & 3.  
Build quality is great though, feels firm in the hand (the 24-70 f2.8 L doesn't hurt).  Super fast camera especially with the focus and lag between shots which is nearly inperceptible.  
This would be a great backup camera for professionals and a great camera for amateur photophiles.

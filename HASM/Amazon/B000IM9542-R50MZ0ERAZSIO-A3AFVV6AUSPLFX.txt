Title: Glad I got this
Content:
This is the first MP3 player I've gotten for myself.  I mainly use it to listen to podcasts and love how easy it is to get my tunes and podcasts onto the player.  I also have an FM transmitter/charger for it, so it gets used almost every day when I'm commuting and also when I walk.  Made the mistake of getting my daughter an iPod Nano last year for Christmas and it was nothing but a pain.  It ended up being stolen out of her locker recently, but this time she'll be getting a Sansa 6 GB player for Christmas to replace the iPod--I'm sure it will be lots fewer headaches for both of us.  Now that her brother just let me  know he wants an MP3 player for Christmas too, I'm back to Amazon to order a Sansa for him also.

Title: Well thought out design
Content:
Premium price, but a great product.  The ipod itself is compact and easy to use.  I don't care for proprietary(restricted) software, but have to admit that Apple itunes works very well.  The only thing it needs is a lanyard ring so I don't need a bulky pouch for the gym.  I would recommend this product.

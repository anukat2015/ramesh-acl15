Title: Disappointing coffeemaker
Content:
I received this coffemaker as a Christmas present last year, and the quality of the coffee is just disappointing.  It seems weak and always has a burned smell/taste to it, even the first cup but especially after it's been in the pot for more than a few minutes.  I've tried using more beans, less beans, ground coffee, filtered water, bottled water, tap water, wire filter, white paper filters, brown paper filters.....but I've never hit on a combination that give me a cup of coffee without the burned taste and smell.  
As for cleanup, it's not a big deal unless you're making multiple pots of coffee.  Just pop the parts in the dishwasher.  I've never had the filter door pop open while brewing as others have.  The grinder is VERY noisy.
Overall, it's just a disappointment for the money.  Since I'm the only coffee drinker in the family, I'm thinking about a single serve machine like the Keurig.

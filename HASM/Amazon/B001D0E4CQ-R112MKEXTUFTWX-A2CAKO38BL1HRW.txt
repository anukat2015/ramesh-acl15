Title: Wait for Generation X
Content:
I have been a buyer of all of the earlier generations of Archos products.   I have nothing against Archos except that they should have done a lot more in 3 generations in advance of what I currently own and they have not.....it is no big trick to just add memory....but ease of use is the same...., not easy!!!  and the touch screen is just as bad as it was in the earlier generations.   I actually returned my unit after trying to just register it with the on screen querty keyboard.  A giant pain in the ass.   I would stay away from this model.  Maybe the larger sized screens are better, but all in all, I would not use this unit if they gave it to me at no cost.

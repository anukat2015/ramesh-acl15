Title: Cooling takes a long time
Content:
We were disappointed to find out after purchasing this unit that it takes a long time to cool a room. It's not like a window unit that pumps out frigid air for quick relief. For the 150-square-foot office in our home, it takes 6-8 hours to lower the temperature from the 80s to the low 70s. A Pinguino rep we contacted said that the slow cooling is part of the design--the unit is also a dehumidifier and uses the collected moisture as part of the cooling process. The unit does have a timer so you can program it to turn on before you get home or before you get up in the morning to get a jump on the house heating up. But none of this machine's slow-cooling characteristics are mentioned in any of the materials.

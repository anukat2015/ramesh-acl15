Title: Great vacuum
Content:
Although small, this little vacuum has huge suction and does a great job. Having 3 cats and 3 dogs in the house, I get quite a bit of animal hair and this picks it all up. I will admit to having to stop frequently and brush out the filter or empty the cup which is a pain, but it is worth it just for the great job it does on my carpets.

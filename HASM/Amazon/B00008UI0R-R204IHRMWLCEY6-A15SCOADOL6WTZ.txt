Title: Wouldn't Buy  It Again
Content:
I have this vacuum for almost 2 years.  My place gets pretty dirty. I have two dogs who don't shed but bring in lots of dirt from their walks.  While the cleaning has been great, I find it a pain to use.
The positives:  
1.Strong, adjustable suction for carpets and rugs. 
2.Controls on handle make it easy to change settings.  
3.Bagless.
The negatives: 
1. Extremely heavy-- around 30 pounds.  That is a lot for me to manage on stairs.  Even if I add an extension cord, cleaning and holding the machine on stairs is awkward and difficult.  
2. Short cord.  
3. Wheels don't swivel so it moves awkwardly around things.  Sometimes tips sideways.
4. Attachments (other than power nozzle) don't go on securely or easily and don't swivel.  
Emptying the bagless dust section can be very messy.  I usually empty it before I clean.  There is a tool for scraping out all the dust and dirt that collects in the filter. I have had other bagless vacs and find this one messier.  I often do it outside.
I would prefer a lighter vacuum that moves more smoothly. Something that would just follow behind me effortlessly while I clean.

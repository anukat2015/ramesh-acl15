Title: Good Heater but too noisy
Content:
I think this is a great heater, given it's size I think it will heat up a pretty big area.  I used it only one night and it kept us warm but it was just too noisy.  It made me jump a couple of times when it turn on automatically at night.  I also don't like how I need to turn the knobs for it's settings...
I would recommend it if don't mind the noise too much....

Title: Great overall laptop
Content:
After doing a good amount of research, I found this laptop to be a good overall product for a reasonable price.
The processor speed, memory capacity and functionality makes it great for students and those who are fairly mobile. The hardware is of good quality and I have recently noticed ASUS has been rated at the top of the market for their PCs/laptops.
Though I hate to spend money, I also like to have tools that to the job without hassles. So, I usually bet on getting a new laptop every 3-4 years due to changes in technology and software and I think this model will be more than sufficient.
Don't just trust me, do your own research, compare, talk to people who know computers well, consider what you are looking for and give this laptop a chance. I think you will find it to be hard to beat if you want a good laptop for a reasonable price.

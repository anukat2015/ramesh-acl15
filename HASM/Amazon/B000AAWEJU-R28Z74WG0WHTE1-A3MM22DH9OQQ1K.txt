Title: Finally I got a vaccum that really works
Content:
I've had the Dyson vacuum for 3 years and I don't know why it took me so long to change it.  This miele is excellent compared to dyson.  It is light, it really sucks everything in the corners without having to change to the small device. It doesn't have high noise.  I love it. It is better to spend a little more on this one and really have the work done.  for carpets and floor it is giving me perfect results.

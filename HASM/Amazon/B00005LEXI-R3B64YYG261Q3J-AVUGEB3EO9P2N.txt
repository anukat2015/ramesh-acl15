Title: Lack of filter ruined my heater /Parts no longer available
Content:
When I bought my "Buddy" MH9B 3 years ago there was no mention of having to use a fuel filter. This lack of information caused my heater to build up with oil from the 20lb tanks I used. The control valve (part # 73416) is shot and no longer available from Mr. Heater. All of the lines have oil residue in them and this heater no longer works. I paid $104.00 for a heater that worked well for only 3 years.  Has anyone else had this problem?

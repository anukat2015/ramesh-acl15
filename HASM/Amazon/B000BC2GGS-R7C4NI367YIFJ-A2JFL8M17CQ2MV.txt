Title: Not all that great...does not distribute heat.
Content:
We purchased this because it was listed as the safest space heater by consumer reports.  We found that the heat it puts off really only puts off right at the heater.  You have to almost touch it to feel the warmth.  It's hot to touch, which is expected.   The thermostat part isn't that great because you put it up to a degree that seems comfortable (75) and it is reading the temperature right at the source of heat, so it hits this temperature right away.  We haven't yet determined a high enough temperature to keep the room at a pleasant temperature.  Pros are it's very quite and easy to use.   We have gone back to using our small honeywell space heater that blows hot air.  Seems safer and keeps a large living area warm.

Title: A great little vacuum!
Content:
I had gone over many reviews for canister vacuums, and finally decided on this one. My old Hoover canister, 21 years old, had started to lose suction. The Electrolux 3670G Canister (12 amp) Vacuum is light, easy to use, and has great suction. It was also rather inexpensive, but is so good that I would have been willing to pay more! The product information indicated that it was especially for bare floors, but it works as well on rugs. There is a special brush attachment for drapes and furniture. It is very easy to vacuum under furniture because the  carpet head is so low. I have birds, so it is great in picking up seed, feathers and litter. Someone had mentioned in a review that the tube attachments come apart sometimes, but I only use one, and so I have no problems. Great product!

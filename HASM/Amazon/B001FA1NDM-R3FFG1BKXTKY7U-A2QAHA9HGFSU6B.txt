Title: 16 GB IPOD NANO - Excellent!
Content:
There are not too many brands that I am loyal to. Price is usually the deciding factor in many of my purchases although if what I purchase is low quality then I have no problem paying more for something that will last. In this case I do prefer IPOD and the NANO is "Da Bomb"! 
I love it and the 16 GB version will give me the space I need for the music I want. 
Easy to use, easy to set up, easy to update. I love it!

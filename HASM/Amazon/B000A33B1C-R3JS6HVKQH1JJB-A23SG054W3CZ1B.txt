Title: Not what I expected for the price
Content:
I put this heater in my large room and it's okay but not what I expected.  For the cost, I expected more.  I wish it had a remote control as I am disabled and cannot control the temperature.  [I'm not sure what it is.]  It is set for my husband's comfort range [he's cold natured, I'm hot natured and he programmed the heater].  I cannot tell by looking at it from a distance if its it even working.  What I plan to do is have it placed in my bedroom [I want it cooler] and replace it with a differant [remotely controlled, digital, easier to read, cheaper] heater.

Title: Great Laptop Replaced Prior Sony Vaio
Content:
I had a prior Sony NW 250 from 2 years ago and decided on a new VAIO and did a lot of research. This is a very solid laptop.  Love the Screen, I originally bought the other Sony because of the screen quality and so that was the most important thing to me.  This screen is amazing.  It is bright (not sure about the person that rated it as dull I know that other versions of this FW line (530 and above are much less bright but the 510 is exceptionally bright).  I also like the larger hard drive and chip set.  Although you will have to uninstall the crap ware that comes from Sony and update the start-up to get it to be fast at startup.
The speakers are great for a laptop much better then my last Sony.  The keyboard is awesome just like an Apple laptop.  Highly recommended for the 510 version of the FW line.  I would definitely look at other models of this line before buying because the screen is not as good on the higher numbered models (530-and up of the FW line).  But at this price point and specs it is a great deal.  And it has good trade-in value on Gazelle as well.
My last Sony got over $300 at trade in that I used toward this one.  Something else to consider.

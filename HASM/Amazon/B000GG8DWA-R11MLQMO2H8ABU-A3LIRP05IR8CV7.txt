Title: Radiant Heater
Content:
It does what radiant heaters do: warm the surfaces of items (or people) within range of its 2x400w heating elements. In my experience, that range is about 4'. It does not heat a room. Neither does it heat air particularly well. As long as you don't expect it to make a cold room warm (like a forced-air heater would), you won't be disappointed.
PS: It's great for warming up pink winter cheeks.

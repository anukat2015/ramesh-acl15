Title: Simply the best
Content:
This laptop is amazing. the screen is brilliant, sound is great,has a lot of awesome features and best of all windows 7 runs like a well oiled machine. The price is what attracted me to this machine in the first place but i was blown away when i used it. The processor is great and 4 gigs of RAM is plenty plus a 500 gig HD is nice. Overall it is a must buy at this price when compared to more expensive machines.

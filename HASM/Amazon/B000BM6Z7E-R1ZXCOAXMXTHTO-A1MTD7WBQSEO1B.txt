Title: Very Satisfied
Content:
Considering the features you get with the Zen  & the price it is selling for, you cannot beat it.  I ordered mine from Amazon.com based on customer reviews and a recommendation from a friend.  What others are saying is true ~ the touchpad is sensitive, the battery drains faster than I would like it to, and you have to recharge the device through your hard-drive.  
This last item is the most annoying for me.  My computer does not charge my Zen unless the power is turned on.  Also, my Zen only charges when it's hooked up to the computer in which the software was installed.  That has become annoying b/c I cannot charge it at work, but I can easily purchase the adapter and cease worrying about it.
 
Overall ~ the sound quality, the space offered and the size are all great reasons to buy this player.  The software is user-friendly and you only need a preliminary understanding of computers to work with it.  
I'd recommend this to anybody looking to buy a great player for a very reasonable price.

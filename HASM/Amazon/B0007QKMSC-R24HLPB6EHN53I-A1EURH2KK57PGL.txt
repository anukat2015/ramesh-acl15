Title: I really love this camera
Content:
I've always been a fan of digital. I like the idea of previewing my photos before paying for the processing.  I'm also a fan of Canon.  I started with their powershot series digitals and then wanted something where I could play with lenses.  I bought the first 6mp digital rebel and loved that one.  Took crisp, quick photos.  The only downside to that camera was it was quite heavy and it was silver (my lenses were all black).  
So when the XT came out I was excited.  Initially I was expecting to see an improvement in performance, but when you go from 6MP to 8MP you're really not improving on the resolution (roughly the square root of the MPs).  This camera still gives quick, sharp photos. Plus it's smaller and lighter than the 6mp digital rebel.  I also found that the XT felt more solid and less like plastic.  The setting dial is made of metal instead of plastic.  I also found that the batteries seem to last for a really long time on this camera.  So I don't really worry about switching out when I want to get a shot.
Overall I'm really glad I purchased this camera.  It was a little more than the 6mp (and if price is an issue you can easily get away with the 6mp) but I'm very happy I bought it.

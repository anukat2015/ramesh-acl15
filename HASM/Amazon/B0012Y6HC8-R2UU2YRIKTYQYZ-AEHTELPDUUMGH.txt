Title: Perfect for semi-professional photography!
Content:
My business as a graphic designer has required more and more product photography, so to keep up with demand and quality, I purchased the Canon XSi and have not been disappointed! I have only used it for still-shots, but the quality is outstanding, I get great close-ups and have plenty of photo options for the different types of shots I want to take. Excellent product!

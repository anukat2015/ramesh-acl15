Title: Excellent canister vacume from Eureka
Content:
I've owned my Eureka Sanitaire Commercial canister vac for about 2 years now and haven't had a single problem with it.  I purchased one because I have tile floors and hated trying to drag around a large upright carpet floor vacume to use the hose and wand attachments to clean them.  This vac has several things working in it's favor. The motor in the Sanitaire provides strong suction, the outer shell is durable, the bags it uses are fairly easy to find at reasonable prices, and you can attach an optional HEPA filter module at the back of the vacuum where the air exhaust is located.  This a fairly straightforward vacuum to operate and maintain.  Periodically open the vac before using it to check whether the bag needs to be replaced, and if you notice an obvious decrease in suction while using the vac that isn't due to an obstruction inside the hose, try replacing the bag even if it doesn't appear to be full.  Each bags usable life can depend more on the type of contents in it than the overall quantity of material you see in the bag.  A bag containing mainly small to super fine dust restricts air flow more than say a bag filled with much larger spilled cat food.  Particularly so when you are using the more air flow restrictive micro lined 99.7% filtration allergy bags.  When changing the bag also be sure to remove and clean the filter disk at back of the bag compartment.  One thing to be aware of, this vacuum does produce quite a bit of heat when it's in use and the hot air blowing from the exhaust might surprise you.  It appears to be a normal part of operation though.

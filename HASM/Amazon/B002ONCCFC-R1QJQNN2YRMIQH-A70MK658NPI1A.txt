Title: Nice computer for the price
Content:
This is the second laptop I have purchased, both of which were Compaq. 
I got this laptop to upload pictures, surf the internet, and for general use around the house. The monitor is great and the picture is crisp and bright. The speed of this laptop is just what I had hoped for. I love the keypad that this laptop has...a big plus for the price! 
I got a great deal on this laptop. I wanted a good laptop without having a huge bottom line to spend. I would recommend this laptop...Great little laptop! I don't regret sticking with Compaq. 
The options available on this laptop, including the battery life are very good. I am able to work on things for hours and not worry about the battery dying. 
The overall feel of this laptop is also great...it is smooth and sleek and looks great just sitting on the counter.

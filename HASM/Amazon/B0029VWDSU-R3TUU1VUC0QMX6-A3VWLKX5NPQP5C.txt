Title: Run, run like hell
Content:
I bought two of these wonders and gave one each to my daughters for Christmas.  It is now April and both have crapped out already.  Guess what, no one will stand behind these beauties.  It is the biggest peace of crap that anyone has fostered upon the American public since the Ford Pinto.  Apparently Gevalia bought thousand and thousands of these and they gave them so much trouble that they discontinued their "pod coffeemaker" program entirely.  With thousands of these sitting in a warehouse they turned over sales and liquidation to [...] and every other liquidator in the world.  All of these advertised that the wretched machines had a warranty.  However, when problems started to arise (by the thousands) none of the principals would stand up and take responsibility.  They looked like the insurance industry after Katrina (not my fault, not my problem).

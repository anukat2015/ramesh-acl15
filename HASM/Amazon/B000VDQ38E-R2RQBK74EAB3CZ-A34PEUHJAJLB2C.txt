Title: This vacuum sucks - cat hair!
Content:
After reviewing vacuum cleaners on Consumner Reports, I decided to get the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser. It met nearly all the requirements I was looking for. First and foremost, excellent at picking up pet hair. This is very important in my house as we have 2 furry creatures and 1 in particular that sheds pounds of fur every year. Second, it needed to be good on carpet and bare floors and third, it needed to be lightweight so that I could use it without getting a hernia. The vacuum propels itself forward and is easy to pull back. The vacuum also has good attachments that really work. The only negative is that when you are using the attachements, the vacuum continues to suck air at the bottom. Other than that, this is a great vacuum for a decent price. I am super happy to erase the pet hair in my home using this vacuum.

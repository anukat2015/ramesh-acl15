Title: Small but packs a punch
Content:
Had this for over a year, using under my desk at work (where the heating is). It blows... in a good way! You'd want a heater like this that blows the hot air versus one of those that mimics a wall radiator, they're big and useless. My coworker has one of those and it sucks! I let her try mine and she wanted one.
I'm a perfectionist and would not easily give a perfect rating. It is great for my purposes, which is under the desk heating. There's temperature adjustment and I usually use a little less than medium, but sometimes my feet get so hot that I have to turn it off. However I can't speak for open spaces such as trying to heat a whole room. I used it briefly in my apt before they turned the heat on, and while I could feel the difference, it can't of course, replace building or central heating.

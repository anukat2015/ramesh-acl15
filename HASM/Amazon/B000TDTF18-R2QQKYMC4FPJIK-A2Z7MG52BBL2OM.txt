Title: Do not buy unless you love the smell of burnt coffee in the morning
Content:
I bought this cause I loved the idea of the front loading. However I am having the same problem of the leaking from the back. Coffee pools on the burner leaving a stinky dirty mess. 
I can get another from Delonghi but I am not sure I want to pay them $10 to ship me another one that may have the same defect. 
It's my first Delonghi purchase and I am disappointed!

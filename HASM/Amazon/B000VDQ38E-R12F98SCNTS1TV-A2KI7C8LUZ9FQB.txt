Title: TOO SHABBY TOO HEAVY TOO LOUD
Content:
I purchased the Bissel Pet Eraser because we own cats and dogs. The animal hair was out of control and I thought an upright with 12 amps might be better than my older ElectroLux Canister. The first time I used the vacum it did seem to pick up lots of animal hair. I had to empty the canister three times for two rooms. The first negative thing I noticed was that the rotating brush did not stop after detaching the hose to use other attachments. Things went downhill from there. The dirt canister is pretty easy to remove and empty. BUT, the throat above the canister that has some sort of filter needs to be removed for cleaning and that is very hard to get back in. You practically have to turn this heavy monster upside down to do it. The rotating brush stopped working consistently after the third or fouth use and  eventually stopped for good. This vacum is heavy, cumbersome and loud.  It is almost impossible to manuever and it certainly does not pick up anything along the edges of rooms. The price was so attractive to me and I read many positive reviews. It definitely did not live up to any of the reviews. I wish I had never purchased it. If you are still looking, keep up the search, do not buy this vacum.

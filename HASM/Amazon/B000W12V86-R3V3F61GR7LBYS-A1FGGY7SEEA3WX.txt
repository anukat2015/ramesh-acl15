Title: Hang on to your old XP notebook
Content:
I can't begin to say how disappointed I am with this product having had it for about a year.  I bought it to replace an 8 year-old Compaq Presario that had finally gone to the great junk yard in the sky.  I spent a long time researching options on this and other makes before finally going for this one.
The big problem is of course Vista.  My 8-year old notebook took less than 10 seconds to boot up when new and was still getting there in under 30 8 years later.  This one?  Well over a minute just to get going, and if you need to restart you had go put a pot of coffee to brew because you'll be enjoying a cup before the computer has finished.  This extends to every operation you do, what used to take a blink of an eye takes a long yawn.  And that makes it impossible to enjoy.
The screen is excellent, the speakers are good, the keyboard is a keyboard.  I optimistically tried to return it after a month but 'its not very good' was not sufficient grounds for a refund.  
Honestly if your old XP computer is still working - hang on to it or buy a mac, just don't bother with one of these.  The problem is not with the HP product which seems robust - its the operating system.  Would you trade in your 2000 BMW because its old and be happy to have a brand new 1985 Buick LeSabre given to you?  Thats what this feels like

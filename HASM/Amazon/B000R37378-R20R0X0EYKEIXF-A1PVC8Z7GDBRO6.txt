Title: Effective but very loud
Content:
Air N Water sent this to me, when a different unit didn't perform.  I was eager to try it out.  The water is poured through an odd slot in the front.  You have to get on your knees to pour it in and see the gauge.  If you over fill (which I did the first time because I didn't understand the gauge's readings), it pours out a tube in the back.  eesh.  I had to fix the little doohickys which oscillate the air as 2 had come out of their slots.  No big deal.  Turn them on and turn the unit on.  WOOSH!  Nice cool air comes out with quite a bit of force.  I will say it is LOUD.  Even on the lowest setting.  I have it in my bedroom & found it somewhat hard to sleep with it on.  I'm sure it is because it has quite a bit of force to it, but, it comes at a cost.

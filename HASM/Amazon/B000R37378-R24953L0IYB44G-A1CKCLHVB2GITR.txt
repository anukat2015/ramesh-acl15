Title: horrible purchase
Content:
This air cooler was horrible. It was so loud, and bigger than we anticipated. We bought it to cool our baby's room during the summer months, but there was no way she could sleep with it on. It did not even cool her small room better than the fan she already had. In addition, it smelled like fish when it was running. Disgusting! We tried it for a few days to see if it got better, but we ended up returning it (at our cost!) 
I would not recommend this at all

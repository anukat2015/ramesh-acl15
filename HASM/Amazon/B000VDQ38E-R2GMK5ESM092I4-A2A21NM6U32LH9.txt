Title: No match for my pets' hair
Content:
Although this vacuum does have a variety of nice attachments, I don't think its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.  I do have 2 medium haired cats and a 2 year old Golden Retriever, which is why I bought a machine that is marketed to target pet hair.  
The attachments are great.  The rubber pink thing is particularly good at getting fur off of furniture, stairs, etc.  Unfortunately, once it picks up the hair, it regularly jams up the beater bar and the connection from the hose to the machine itself. At this point it loses all suction. 
Furthermore, emptying the receptacle, which needs to be done at least twice per session, stirs up a huge mess.  The filters are also messy to clean, a task which also has to be done more often than I would like.
Add to that the bulk, weight and general awkwardness and I would not recommend this machine to anyone with stairs.

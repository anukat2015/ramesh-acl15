Title: Works well
Content:
This heater has worked out well. It doesn't heat super quickly but most the time if I set it towards myself I'm toasty in just a couple minutes. The room obviously takes longer to heat up. 
If this is your only heater, then no it won't completely heat a large room. However if you are supplementing a furnace that doesn't quite warm up your room enough, it is perfect. Of course if you put it somewhere with lots of windows or doors that are opened a lot it will be less effective.
Cons;
It is fairly narrow and would not be difficult to tip over. Even though it has a tipover off switch it could still melt or burn something.
From the front you can't see what the setting is and the dial rotates endlessly so you can't feel your way to what setting it is on. Just grab a  Sharpie and write a label for yourself on the front of the dial.
Both a Pro and a Con is its silence. Love the quietness, but it would be quite easy to forget this heater is on when you leave.

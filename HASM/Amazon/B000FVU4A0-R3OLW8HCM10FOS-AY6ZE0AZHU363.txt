Title: Well Worth the Price
Content:
This coffee maker is an excellent value and brews a good steaming hot pot of coffee.  Using four rounded scoops of Dunkin coffee for 10 cups is about the right amount for our taste and this is the same amount we have used historically with other machines.  The brewed coffee is hot, about 185 degrees as it exits the filter and it is maintained at about 175 deg in the carafe.  The carafe pours well without drips.  The removable water tank is a nice touch.  It makes it cleanable and we can now use water from our refrigerator filter saving the cost of in tank filters (available as an added cost option on this machine).  There are a few negatives.  The design of the filter basket lid has many nooks and crannies that collect condensation and make it difficult to wipe out.  The carafe seems to be made of thin glass (there are multiple precautions about possible breakage in the instructions) and it is not dishwasher safe.  Except for these minor deficiencies it would have a five star rating.

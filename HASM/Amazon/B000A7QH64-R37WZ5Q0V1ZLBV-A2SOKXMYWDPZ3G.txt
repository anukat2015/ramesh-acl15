Title: Cautiously optimistic
Content:
This review is probably a little premature because we've only had the vac for about 28 hours.  I charged it for 24 hrs and then used it for the first time.  It did a brilliant job sucking the cat hair off my corduroy couch.  On the other hand, the very first charge only lasted 20 min.  I've fully discharged it and plugged it back in.  Hopefully the usage time will increase after a few charge/discharge cycles because 20 min of use followed by 12 - 24 hrs of charging isn't going to be particularly convenient at our house.

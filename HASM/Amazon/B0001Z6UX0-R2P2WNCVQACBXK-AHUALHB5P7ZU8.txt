Title: Quiet and Warm
Content:
I replaced a fan-driven heater under my desk with this model.  It is really too big for an under-the-desk heater but it fit under mine barely.  It is silent and very warm.  I am much more comfortable now.
The sides have what appears to be smoothly finished grey paint on steel. The top grill that wraps down the front is stainless.  The looks are very nice and the the thermostat works well.  A great solid heater.

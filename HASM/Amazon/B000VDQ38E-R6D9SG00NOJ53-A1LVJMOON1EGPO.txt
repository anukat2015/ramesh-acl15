Title: What a difference
Content:
I've been researching new vacuums after being increasingly disappointed in my Dirt Devil.  Forget those ads with the Golden Retriever pups---the Dirt Devil was practically worthless on MY Golden Retriever's hair!  I bought the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser today at Target after reading the previous reviews and agree with everyone.  It is heavy but does an amazing job for a very economical price.  I'd just vacuumed last night with my old model, and was shocked by how much more hair the Bissell picked up on just the first run.  It filled two dirt cups with hair and dirt in just a small 2 bdrm apt.  So far, so good!

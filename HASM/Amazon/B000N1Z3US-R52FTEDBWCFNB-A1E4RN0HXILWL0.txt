Title: Not up to Black & Decker standards...
Content:
We previously owned a Black & Decker standard glass carafe coffee maker, and were extremely pleased with it.  We then went through a Gevalia branded thermal carafe drip coffee machine, and loved it.  When it finally quit working, we purchased this machine, and have been very disappointed.  It's cheaply made, and the carafe leaks.  We are constantly having to mop up drips and the carafe doesn't pour well.  It makes "okay" coffee, but this product is definitely NOT up to Black & Decker standards.  If you want a good drill or saw, get a Black & Decker.  If you want a good coffee maker, get another brand!

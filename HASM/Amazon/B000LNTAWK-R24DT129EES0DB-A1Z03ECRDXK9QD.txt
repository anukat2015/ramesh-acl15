Great Camera!  Very Professional.  Great Lens.  With this lens it is the only lens you really need unless you want to do something very special.  I also got the DVD instruction manual which I've found to be very helpful.  But once you have gone through that you can begin to experiment with all the possibilities this camera offers.  It is a good buy if you're looking for a camera with unlimited potential, but be prepared, it is heavy for some users.  I don't find that a problem but my daughters have.  Unlike some digital cameras, this camera is very quick in taking a picture and recording in on the compact disc.  So for taking action pictures, or little children it is great.

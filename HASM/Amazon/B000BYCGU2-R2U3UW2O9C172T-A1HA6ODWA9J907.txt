Title: Tastes great & looks good
Content:
I read all of the reviews on this product before I made my purchase and almost did not make it.  I was worried that I would wake up one morning and have coffee all over my counter, but it has not happened.  Consumer Reports rated it very high so I went for it.  It is easy to use, I have not had any problems, looks great in my kitchen, and the coffee is excellent.

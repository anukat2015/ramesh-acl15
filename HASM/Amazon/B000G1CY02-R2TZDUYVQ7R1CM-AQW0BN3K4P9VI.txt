Title: May not be an energy saver
Content:
This heater has the ability to heat at minimum power of 750W or maximum power of 1500W with a thermostat that offers 6 setting. It can also be wall-mounted or placed  on a stand with pieces for either mounting in the box with the heater.
 I used it in a 332' square area at the 1500W setting and accelerated my light bill by an average of $25.00 a month. It did keep the area warm though the power consumption was a surprise. 
 I had my first heater replaced under warranty after it simply quit heating and had no issues with warranty service. 
(Nov 08) I have moved this heater to an 8 x 10 room (with a closed door), have it set to minimum power (750W) with a thermostat setting of 3. The room is warm and the remainder of the house has a chill of 62 degrees. No noticeable changes with the electric bill at this point.

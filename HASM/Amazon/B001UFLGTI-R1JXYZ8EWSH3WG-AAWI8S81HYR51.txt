Title: HP Laptop with webcam
Content:
I bought 2 Dells 2 years ago. One for me and my son. Both PCs are no good at this point. I do not even have them paid for. I paid around $550 each for them. It was my first laptop, so I was afraid to put a lot of cash into them. I was not sure if I would like a laptop. I bought a HP printer that I have gotten great service from. I wanted a HP PC. I also wanted one with a webcam built in. I needed one with high speed and more memory. The HP I bought is great. I did not know it had a side keyboard into I received it, which was a wonderful bonus. I am an accountant, so I love the side keyboard. It was always difficult using the numbers on top. It is a large laptop with a wider screen. It has a lot of features I probably will never use, but I am totally satisfied with the product. I have ordered books and other items from Amazon. I have gotten great serve from them.

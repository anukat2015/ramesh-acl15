Title: Review of Hoover S3765-040 Wind Tunnel Vacuum
Content:
Vac has many good features, including a power upholstery nozzle and side brushes on the main carpet nozzle that allow one to get right up to baseboards and automatically adjusts to carpet pile.  Unit is bagless; one just empties a plastic dirt cup.  Has dual air filters, including a HEPA filter.  Has tall casters, so it travels easily and does not tip sideways.  Has multiple suction strengths with an indicator light on the console.  Has an extra-wide floor attachment.  Is much quieter than most home vacuums.  Has an extensible wand/hose to accommodate different heights of operators.  Unit seems tough.  Comprehensive instructions allow the owner to trouble-shoot problems like clogs and snarls from such things as pet hair easily.  Only criticism is that attachments other than the two power nozzles do not seem to "lock" into bottom of pipe in just one position so one may have to rotate them experimentally to achieve the right bends in the hose and pipe to allow the attachments to "sit" on the floor properly.

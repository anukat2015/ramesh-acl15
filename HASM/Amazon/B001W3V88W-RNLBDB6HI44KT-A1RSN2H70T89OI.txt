Title: I love my machine
Content:
I purchased this machine because I like to drink various drinks as the whim takes me.  Tassimo allows you to do this.  Also, most of the time I'm by myself, so don't need to make a large pot of coffee.  Before I made the purchase, I was comparing Keurig with the Tassimo.  The reason I chose the Tassimo was a) the price  b) the T-discs were more available than the K-cups and the only K-cups the stores here carried were Van Houtte coffee, which I detest c) reviews said the Tassimo makes better lattes and cappuccinos.  I'm extremely happy with the machine for the following reasons:
- absolutely no mess
- the availability of different brews, from very dark roasts to light roast, hot chocolate (which IS a bit sweet), teas, lattes (in particular my fave, chai latte), cappuccinos, espressos, cremas and even decafs - I like a darker roast but was even able to find t-disks that were too strong for me
- I like that I can have 4 friends over and give them their preference of hot brews
- the tank is big enough that I don't have to fill it for each cup
- the bar code reader means a perfect brew each time
- the size is relatively small, smaller than my old espresso machine and my regular drip coffee machine (both of which have now been sold off)
- you have a cup of coffee in a matter of minutes vs a drip coffee machine or even a french press
- using just the cleaner disk, you can also simply spit out hot water for your own tea bags
- most of the t-disks are a reasonable price, brewing a cuppa can be less than 50 cents a cup.  The Starbucks disks are more expensive, taking you closer to a dollar a cup, but what the hey, what did you pay the last time you actually went into a Starbucks?  :)
Cons - and yes, even though I LOVE this machine, there ARE some cons:
- most of the disks make a small cuppa (10 oz)unless you get the breakfast blends, which will make a bigger cup, or you can simply brew 2 disks.
- the cup stand doesn't have finite adjustment - you can fit a regular sized mug, the stand adjusts for smaller mugs, but then it's a big leap to a large mug.  If you have a slightly bigger mug, you have to set it on the bottom and then you get some splashing
- the foam is not as stable as coffee shop foams, but then for $99, I didn't expect it to be.  As well the foam stability depends on the t-disk manufacturer as well.  Nabob cappuccino was quite firm foam that lasted the duration of the drink.
- t-disk storage takes up a bit of space - but I'm still in the "try all the varieties until I find my favourite brew" stage, so I have a lot of selections at the moment
In Dec 2009, Tassimo is coming out with packages of just the latte cream.  You will then also be able to use it simply as a milk frother if you wish, or you can make any of your favourite brews into a latte.

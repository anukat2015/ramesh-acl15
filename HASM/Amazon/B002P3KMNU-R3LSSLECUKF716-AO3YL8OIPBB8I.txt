Where can I start?
I've a small 10" Asus 1005 and love the size and battery, but when I needed to work a few hours hated that the screen was TOO small. Everything change with this incredible, beautiful, light-weight, thin and smooth at thouch laptop.
Last monday had to work all day with a proyect and turned on the computer at 11 am and at 8 pm still had 20% of the charge! (I've used wireless, usb drives, usb hdd and sound). Because of my daily routine, I see many customers in an average day, so carrying the laptop is a must to me and the real weight of this Asus is perfect for my back (in my back pack also carry a lot of things, but never again the ac adapter).
The screen is perfect in size and in bright, but always hated the reflecting surface of it in an roofless space. Totally loved that came with the fast express gate (10 secs) that allows me to send a quick email or have a chat without turning the whole windows.
The touch and feel of the surface is excelent. A small detail, but give me the idea that the Asus people thinks is that they put a transparent sticker over the windows licence tag that's under the computer (this is always damaged 'cause of the use and also 'cause the Microsoft people makes it in cheap paper).
If you want a computer where you can do all things (even photoshop, but no gaming), go ahead, this is a sure thing. OH! It came with 2 YEARS warranty and 1 YEAR warranty (you can extend up to two years just registering the laptop in the asus webpage and sending the invoice to them) against accidents, spills, etc!!!! WOW!!!!

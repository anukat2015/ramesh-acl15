Title: More than expected
Content:
This is my first mp3 player and when I first heard about the 32GB Zen I knew my wait was over. I needed a player that would hold my whole CD collection without compromese and was thinking about one of the hard drive versions from Creative(I won't buy Apple products as they are too proprietary. I was sold on the small size and the SSID memory (no moving parts!). When I got it home I had to learn how to load my albums aboard and that was rather time-consuming (I mean the loading not the learning. This technology is amazing; I keep looking that stack of 636 albums and the credit card sized Zen that they fit on and am amazed. I bought some noise isolating earbuds and put my target shooting earmuffs on and I am transported. In the future I'll buy a SD card to put photos and videos and podcasts on. The FM radio gets excellent reception and the voice recorder will come in handy I expect. I recommend this product whole-heartedly

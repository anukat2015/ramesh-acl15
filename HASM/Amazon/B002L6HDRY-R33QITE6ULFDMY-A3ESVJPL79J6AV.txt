Title: Its Pretty... Ok.
Content:
Well, This Is My 5th Apple Product And I Was Satisfied Until This iPod Nano 5th Gen. Over All Its Ok. The Screen Clarity Is Superb & Couldnt Be Better. Apple Designers Must Have Spent Alot Of time Designing A Product With So Many Features Packed In It, And Still Manage To Keep The Device Almost "Paper Thin." 
The Cons:  The Battery Life Is Not Good At All. I Had To Return My Nano Because Of A Faulty Battery, And Still With The Screen Backlight Turned All The Way Down And The Backlight Timer Turned At 2Seconds, It Last Half A Day With Only Music Usage. It Says 24Hours But More Like 12-15. Also The Bottom Of The iPod When You Unplug The Cable From It It Pulls The Plastic Cover On The Bottom Of The iPod Off Some, My First iPod I Returned And The Current iPod It Did It To Both. It Will Probably Break Off With Use Later On. The Quality Of The Button Of The Click Wheel Seems Cheap And Gets Stuck In The Click Wheel When Pushing. 
Apple Have Been Slacking Greatly When It Comes To Quality Control. 
I Now Currently Returned Both My iPod 5th Gen Nano's And Purchased A Creative Zen X-Fi 2. Its Soo Much Better Even Though No Camera "Video Recorder"... Trust Me Its Not Cracked Up To What They Say.

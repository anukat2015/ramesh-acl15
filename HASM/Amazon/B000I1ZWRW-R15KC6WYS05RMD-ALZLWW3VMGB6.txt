Title: Canon Rebel - Daylight King
Content:
Amazing daylight photography... The indoor images (with the built in flash) are really sorry, and images of birthday cakes with candles need to be taken from within 5-7 feet... oops... the danger of getting the cream on the lens.
An external flash is A MUST. Therefore current worthwhile images are from 10AM to 5PM, in good sunlight/daylight... Zooms 70mm upwards will be useless with the inbuilt flash... unless you are into photography of the sands in the afternoon.
As you might figure, I love the daytime images... the technology on the phone is worth every dime, sharp, quick, clear, good heft, balanced, compact... all good. Flash - very bad.

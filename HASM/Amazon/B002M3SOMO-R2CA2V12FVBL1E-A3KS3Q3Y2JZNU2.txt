Title: Fourth return within 30 days
Content:
Unbelievable.  I am a hard core Apple devotee, but they missed the boat on this one.  Bought mine 7 Feb 10.  Today is 18 Feb 10 and my third one is dead after a good workout in the gym.  Tomorrow I will swap it out for number 4.  What is going on here?  Apple's idea is perfection, their execution is pitiful.  The headphone controls are the problem.  Apple's own support pages are chock full of the actual problem.
If I could, I would either recommend NO ONE purchase these, or have Apple do a massive recall.  I guess through a few forums I can do the forum thing.  The biggest problem is that most people (me included) don't dig too deeply until the problem surfaces.
Want an eye opener?  Type "Apple 3G iPod Shuffle Headphone Problems" into Google.  WOW!

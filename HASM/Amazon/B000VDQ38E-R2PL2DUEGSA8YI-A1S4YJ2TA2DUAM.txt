Title: More work then its worth
Content:
We purchased this item because we have 2 dogs and 3 cats, and wanted a machine to tackle the pet hair issue.  It does get the pet hair however there are drawbacks.  If the basket that collects the hair is not on EXACTLY right, the hair either doesn't get vacummed up or it ends up in the upper chamber, twisted around itself.  You have to pull out this piece that has a vented piece on it and unwrap the hair then get that piece back up in the chamber.  That isn't always easy as it has to lock in exactly right.  When you pull out the basket to empty, hair and dust falls from the upper chamber all over the vacumn.  It ends up being quite a mess.  It's a heavy machine and awkward to move around.  The cord is very long - which is usually a good thing - but it ends up being in the way and you're constantly moving it.  When using the hose as an attachment to do stairs, I've found that the machne tends to run hot while on the carpet so I've had to resort to tipping it so the brush isn't against the floor.  So bottom line - it does pick up the pet hair but our Oreck seems to do just as good a job and is a lot lighter and easier to manuever.  Plus you don't have the mess of emptying the basket with dust and fur flying everywhere.

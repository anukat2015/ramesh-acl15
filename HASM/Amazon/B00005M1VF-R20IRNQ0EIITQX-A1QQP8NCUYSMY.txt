Title: Great buy.
Content:
For the price that Amazon is selling this product, this is a great buy.  This was a perfect addition to my dorm room because of its compact size, and I love the sleek look.
Initially, I was quite disappointed that the lid to the travel mug didn't have an open/close spout, since I had wanted something I could throw in my bag with coffee inside of it.  However, I've realized that carrying the mug to class, having a nice cup of coffee or tea that stays warm for a few hours, then throwing it in my bag when I'm done is just as good. (Besides, I've been told that there are very few travel mugs out there that are truly spill-proof, and for that you'd have to shell out a great deal of money.)
I've gotten lots of compliments on the travel mug, which does take a little bit of getting used to drinking out of. It seems to me that if you fill it up not too full (maybe 3/4), then it's easier to drink out of.  But overall, I've been very satisfied with this product.

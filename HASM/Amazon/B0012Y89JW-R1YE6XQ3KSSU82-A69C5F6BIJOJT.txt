Title: Travel writers with many cameras
Content:
The Canon XSi 12.2 MP is our first digital SLR.  We have worked our way up with a number of point and shoot cameras, the last of which was a Kodak P712 - 7.1 MP which was good enough to earn us several magazine covers.  
We are not professional photographers and need an SLR that takes good pictures in "auto" mode for those instances when we do not have time to properly compose a picture.  The Canon XSi really fits the bill.  It takes excellent photos in both auto and manual modes.  
We highly recommend it for non-techy photographers like us.

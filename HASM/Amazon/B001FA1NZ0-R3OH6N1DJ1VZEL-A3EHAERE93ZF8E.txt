Title: Locked into shuffle headphones
Content:
I'll keep this short.  The product works great and looks great.  However, the lack of buttons on the drive is a major flaw.  I'm not a huge fan of the earbuds and I can't share my music through my car stereo.  Please bring the buttons back in the 4th gen.

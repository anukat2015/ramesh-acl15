Title: Canon EOS XTI Digital Camera
Content:
I've had this camera almost 2 months now and I love it more every time I use it.  We just had an ice storm and I took some of the most amazing pictures!  This camera is easy to use and very versatile.  I did invest in a good quality photo software program and it expands my photography efforts tremendously.  I'm not technical, so I can't talk as if I am...all I can say is that this camera will not let you down or disappoint you.  Well worth the money....but then this was the best deal around.

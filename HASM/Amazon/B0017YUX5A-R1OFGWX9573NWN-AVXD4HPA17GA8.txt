Title: Horrrrrible (with 5 r's)
Content:
We've experienced the exact same thing as a lot of other posters - this is the worst vacuum that I've ever purchased. The handle broke twice from the cheap plastic and then something happened with the electricals. All of this within 6 months. My wife only weighs 100lbs and we live in a 1200sqft condo, she might use it every other week but that's all. Then they make you take the vacuum to a local service center, which is not even a Hoover facility btw, and they charge you $25 to open the thing up even though it's under warranty. Go ahead and call Hoover about this - it's true! They even said that using it every other week is too much use for this vacuum - maybe that was just an opener for an upsell opportunity, but these are supposedly Hoover authorized facilities. Depending on your local service center they might nickle and dime you, and for sure will try and upsell. If you don't have your original purchase receipt they will also try and tell you that it's out of warranty - BEWARE OF THIS - The serial number actually confirms the manufacturing date so be informed and don't let them give you the run-around. Anyways, our vacuum is still in service after over 3 weeks - they claim it's not a common replacement part. Either this is true or the vacuum breaks so often that they can't keep the part in stock. Bottom line is the vacuum is sexy, but don't plan on actually using it. Hoover is off the list forever!

Title: Finally(!) found a good vacuum
Content:
I have been through many vacuums over the years, never wanting to spend more than $100, some better than others, others I chucked out after one try. I read reviews on the Lift-Off Revolution vacs online here and then saw this one at Target, had a picture of a dog on the box and thought maybe this would solve my dog-hair problems - none of my vacuums seemed to get up the pet hair well, and my off-white carpet had visible dark dog hair in it, never looking clean. 
I bought this vacuum and I swear it is picking up years of embedded dog hair. I had to empty the canister 5 times just for my bedroom and the carpets look CLEAN. The only bad thing is the attachment that I used on the stairs, some kind of turbo thing, got longer hair caught up in it and I had to take it apart to clean it out (says so in the directions) and now I can't seem to get it to fit back together properly and therefore the little roller won't spin. I might have to send for a new attachment but I really don't want to take my vacuum back because I love it so much and don't really care about the hand tool for now. Anyway, it's the best vacuum I've ever had. Works on hard floors too - sucks up the dog hair, although I find I have to use the extra powerful setting I use on the carpets on the hardwood floors too in order to get the hair up.

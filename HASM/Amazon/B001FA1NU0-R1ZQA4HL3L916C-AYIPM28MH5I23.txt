Title: IPod Shuffle
Content:
This is a handy little gadget. Works quite well. The problem I have is with the instructions. Not being familiar with Apple products and their "lingo" it takes some time to translate what needs to be done to use this item into the more common "PC" language. Once translated, the system works OK.

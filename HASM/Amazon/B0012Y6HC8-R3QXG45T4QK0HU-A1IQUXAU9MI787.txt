Title: My first DSLR Cannon Rebel SXI
Content:
This being my first DSLR, I have been impressed with it so far. I have taken about 200 pictures so far in different modes and only had two or three not to be useable.It is great for taking pictures where no flash is wanted. The sport mode is smooth for humans or animals or cars, motorcycles,etc. The IS lens is worth every penny for me. It is very light weight, so easy to carry all day. I would buy it again.

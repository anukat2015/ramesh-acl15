Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
I highly recommend that you do not purchase this machine. I did a lot of research before I bought it. It is a huge disappointment. It is cheaply made, leaks and has no cleaning power. I wanted to clean a 12 x 12 area of carpet and it can't even successfully do that. I tried calling Bissell's help line and could not understand 3 of the 4 people I was asked to speak with for help. They were of no help and suggested i take the machine to a repair store which is at least 45 minutes from me. I purchased it through Amazon and ended up getting it from [...] who now tell me that I can not return it for any reason. This machine is pure junk.......I wish I had purchased a cheap machine at Walmart as I could not be more unhappy with one of those no matter how badly they performed. This machine is now selling for $45 less on Amazon than we paid for it. Maybe [...] will be more helpful when they respond but I will never buy from a store which has no phone number again. Save yourself a lot of headaches and DO NOT buy this machine.

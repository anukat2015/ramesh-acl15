Title: A new iPod!
Content:
I have to say that I absolutely adore this iPod model.  The newer version came out before I bought this item, but after watching Apple's video demo-ing how it worked I decided on this one.  With the newer iPod shuffle (3rd generation) I figured that if I'd have a hard time working it then there'd be no way that the person I was getting this for (my 14 year old brother) was going to be able to work this.  My family has a total of now four of this model shuffle (2nd generation), we have a pink, 2 purple, and now this lovely blue one!  They all work fantastically and have never had a problem.  The primary users for these iPods range from 11-48 years of age.  The secondary users are as young as 3!
This has to be the most durable and versatile iPod when it comes to kids.  It's easy for them to use and it's metal.  Of course there are also a few accessories that can be bought (like an acyllic or metal cover) for this, but I haven't seen any need to so far.  The handy clip makes it perfect for just clipping it to clothes or a bag's strap.  
Though the use of charging this model directly from your computer isn't always ideal when there are younger users since my 11 year old sister doesn't have a computer and has limited usage.  Though, you can purchase an Apple USB Power Adapter for iPod/iPhone that can be used with this specific model's cable and platform for charging.  
Though I don't personally have any of the larger iPod models, through using my friends', I have found that I do favor this one so far for it's durablility and ease of use.

Title: Nikon D80 w/ 18-135 lens
Content:
My third Nikon digital SLR (D50 & D40x).  I purchased the D80 as an upgrade when the prices fell.  The camera performs great in most situations but there is a tendency for photos to be soft compared to the ones taken D40x.  I also experience focus problems when there is a slight fall off in lighting. This is also something I didn't encounter with the other cameras.  Overall I am pleased with the results.

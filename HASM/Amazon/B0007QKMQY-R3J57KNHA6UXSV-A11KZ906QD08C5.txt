Title: Great Camera Body at a Great Price
Content:
April 17, 20010
The Canon Rebel XT was real great for its time. I got one a couple years ago. Actually, I still use it as a backup after buying the Canon Rebel XSi (which presently is in the shop).  My next camera will be better than either of these.  
But I must tell you, the price for the XT has really dropped and so it is a great buy.  If you don't plan to have larger than 11" X 14" print enlargements, the XT really is a smart choice for the serious amateur on a tight budget.  To use more than 8 Megapixels doesn't do much except allow larger prints, but only with lenses that are better the kit lens that usually comes with with the camera body.  Naturally other improvements, and new features, are included in the newer and larger megapixel cameras.  
My advice for really serous armatures and professionals is to buy the best camera they can afford.

Title: A blast from the past?
Content:
For interim use between the weekly haulings out the massive Dyson animal, (Dyson DC07 Cyclone Animal Upright Vacuum, Purple,) I looked at the Dirt Devil Kone Vacuum (7.5 volt) and this, DD's newer, more powerful, 9.6 volt vac.  Having two "house" dogs who have little more to do every day than lie about like couch potatoes and shed, I got the Kurv in luscious choco-latte and I'm glad I did.  I leave it in the living room, charging and ready to go. And go it does!  
Quickly, easily, powerfully.
It's an intriguing decorative piece - prompting one Boomer buddy to inquire - what's that? A Bong?

Title: Gadget of the year!!!
Content:
I never thought I'd live to the day where I'd fit the content of about 24 CD's (240 songs) in a little player the size of a quarter!!
I got one for myself, I was so impressed that I bought another pink one for my mother, my mom is a lady who doesn't even know how to use a TV remote control correctly, yet, she was fully comfortable with her new shuffle in less than 1 minute. I've never seen my mother happier, that I was able to put her all time favorites on this little guy, and she can listen to them all day long... All in all, its a great purchase and I might buy even more as gifts for my loved ones..

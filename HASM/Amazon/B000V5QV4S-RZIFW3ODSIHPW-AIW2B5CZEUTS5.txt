Title: The best canon (for now anyway)
Content:
I have reviewed the canon 30D last year and I didnt think it would get any better but I am here to tell you otherwise. The 40D is an entireley new camera- not the same digic II processor as the 30D.It takes sharper pictures than the 30D. Try shooting in the landscape mode- it is the "hidden secret" of the 40D. the greens and blues are much brighter and sharper. The 40D is Canons hottest camera on their market as of now. It has auto ISO which can be helpful if your not an ISO freak and not into setting that feature. The shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/8000 second on the 40D. (Very fast: the 1/8000 speeds equates to .000125 second on the digital clock).The body alone is going for around $950 as of July 2008. It is not an introductory camera nor is it a top of the line- it sits right in the middle.I will add more to this post as I start using this camera more.

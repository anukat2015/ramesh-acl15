Title: Cheat Sheet for the Canon 7D DSLR
Content:
When one acquires a new gadget there is always (at least in our house) a rush to acquire information sources to ease the learning curve.  In my case, the transition from a Canon 30D DSLR camera to a 7D DSLR is a BIG jump.  In addition to the usual books, I looked for a small summary that would fit in a pocket.
Another 7D owner called my attention to the  PhotoBert Photo CheatSheet. It is not pocket size but it is easily contained in one's camera bag. It is well laid out and provides access quickly to the data that a new owner needs in the field (in order to not look like a new owner).

Title: If you like warm, not hot, coffee....
Content:
Then this is the coffee maker for you.  It's easy enough to use, a bottom-of-the-line model with no bells and whistles, but with 4 annoying flaws.
The worst is that the coffee never comes out hot -- it's at an easy-to- drink heat that's not hot enough for me.  Second, the heating plate doesn't keep the coffee hot enough. Third, there's no automatic shutoff, a nuisance.  Fourth, the carafe drips a lot when it's poured at any but the slowest rate.

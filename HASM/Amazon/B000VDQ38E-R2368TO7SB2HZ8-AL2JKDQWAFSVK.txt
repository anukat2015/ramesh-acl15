Title: I LOVE IT!!!!
Content:
We just purchased this Vacuum after discovering that our Dirt Devil wasn't doing the job! We have 3 small children and a German Shepard mix dog, so yeah there is always a mess to clean up. Our dog sheds very bad and when we had the old Vac. Our carpets, clothes , and furniture were always covered with dog hair. I have only used it twice, but since then we are no longer covered with DOG HAIR!! I can't believe what a wonderful job this does. I would recommend this vac. to ALL pet owners!! It is a bit heavy, but if you are a normal healthy adult you will have no problems with this machine. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

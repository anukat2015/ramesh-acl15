Title: iPod Gen 5.5 review
Content:
SO FAR, this product is preforming as I'd expected. The only thing I'm disappointed in is it doesn't seem to have a "photos" tab/section like it does Movies and Music where you can isolate photos you want to store on it.  The battery lasts surprisingly long time.  I bought an APC extended life (10 hour) portable batter for it (about the same size as the iPOD...last 10 hours), but have yet to need to use it and I've watched a full movie (2.25 hours) and still had plenty of battery left.
My last Photo iPod's hard disk bought the farm WAY too early and the cost of fixing it was over half the price of a new one.

Title: Great vacuum with a small dust bag
Content:
I purchased this vacuum because it was rated the best by Consumer Reports.  (Immediately after I purchased it the next issue of Consumer Reports had a new review that rated a Kenmore vacuum equal to the Electrolux.)  I was most concerned about having a vacuum that would pick up cat hair.  My cat has especially soft down-like fur that sticks to everything.  My previous vacuums had never cost more than about $70.  But after getting this cat, my old vacuum would not pick up her fur.  I had to get down and scrape it off the carpet with a shower squeegy.  The electrolux has changed my life.  It is amazing to see my carpets so free of cat hair.  It is also nice to have the dusting brush and the crevice tool attached to the handle so it is easy to switch tools.  The suction is really powerful even with the attachments.  The one drawback is the small size of the dust bag.  My previous vacuum had a much larger bag and also because it didn't pick up as much dirt and hair I could vacuum my house many times before needing to replace the bag.  It is nice, however, to have the indicator light to let you know that the bag is full.

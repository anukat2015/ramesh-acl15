Title: Warm and Toasty
Content:
I absolutely love this heater. I have had many heaters over the years and this one heats up my bedroom like no other. I currently had a Lasko heater in there and last year I near about froze because I do not usually turn my central heat on. Every since I got this heater I have been warm and toasty. The temp. outside has gotten down to 27 degrees but I could not tell at all because this heater works absolutely perfect. I usually keep it on Low (not a temp. setting) and it keeps my room a warm 88 degrees. I know that seems really hot but I love it because I have RA and tend to get cold really quick. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, IT!!!!

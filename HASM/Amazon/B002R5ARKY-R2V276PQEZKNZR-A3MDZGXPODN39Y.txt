Title: Super laptop at a great price.
Content:
For me, it is the perfect laptop.Its features seems to be the perfect combination. Windows 64 bit, dual processor, 4 gb RAm, 500 gb hard drive ( this is wow) , webcam and microphone, and an optical drive lightscribe- you can label right after burning, and has a remote. I have been looking for six months before I bought this. When I saw the features, I knew right away it was the laptop for me. Thanks Amazon and HP. [...] I don't know if there is another laptop in the market which can beat it at its price and features. The only thing I don't like about it is its warranty coverage which  covers only the US.

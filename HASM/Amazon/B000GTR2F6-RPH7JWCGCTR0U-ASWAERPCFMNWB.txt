Title: If you like HOT coffee, do NOT buy a Keurig B70
Content:
We received a Keurig B70 coffee maker as a Christmas gift, and were so disappointed with it that we got rid of it after three weeks.  All we could get was luke warm coffee... and the best Keurig Customer Service could suggest was to use styrofoam cups to hold the heat in better.  Do yourself a favor and skip this product.

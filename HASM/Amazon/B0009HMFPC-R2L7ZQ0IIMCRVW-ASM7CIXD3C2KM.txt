Title: Great foot warmers
Content:
What I like about the Cozy feet heat inserts is that you can walk around freely with them any where you want to go. You don't have to plug it into a wall because it uses batteries, so your'e not confined to a particlar area. I use rechargable batteries instead of regular alkaline batteries for cost saving and convenience and it does keep you feet pretty warm for several hours. Very useful if you have cold feet in cold weather.

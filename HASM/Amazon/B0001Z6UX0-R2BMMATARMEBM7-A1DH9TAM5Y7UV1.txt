Title: Good while it worked! Broke after 2 months! (10 days of actual useage)
Content:
Good while it worked! But not for large rooms. Broke after 2 months! (and I only used it for mabye 10 nights total) It is now a fashionable paper weight. I do not recommend this heater or the DeLonghi brand (this is the second heater from them that has given me problems - 8 years ago a heater i had of theirs caught on fire!!!!) I now do not trust this company at all. I will now try Vornado. I do give credit to Amazon for taking it back after 2 months. I dont know if I have had bad luck or what, but I dont feel a heater should stop working after 10 days of use. It should last years....Maybe things are not built the way they were 20 - 30 years ago. 
I will say that this is a nicely designed heater but made with very cheap pot metal... (take a close look at it if you choose to order it - look inside) I think more $ went into the design rather than function. (thermostat was not very accurate either)

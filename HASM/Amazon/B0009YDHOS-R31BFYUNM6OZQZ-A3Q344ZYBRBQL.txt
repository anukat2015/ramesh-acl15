Title: Work around the problems
Content:
After reading the reviews I decided against spending over $100.00 on this machine. Then my girlfriend spotted a display model on close out for $70.00.  It was missing the larger filter basket and carafe.  I talked the store manager down to $35.00 and took it home.  After 4 months of use I think I have it figured out.
Issue #1: The seal between the basket and the machine will blow out.  I think this comes from grinding your coffee too fine and tamping it too hard into the basket.  The pump builds too much pressure because the water cannot flow through the fine, hard tamped coffee quickly enough. As a result the seal blows out.  Solution: Do not grind coffee so fine and tamp less.  Water should flow slowly through when brewing, not just drip.  Too fine coffee will also plug the fine holes in the basket.  Clean it after each use by forcing water backward through it from the faucet
Issue #2: Problems with the frothing attachment blowing off or plugging.  After each use, clean the frothing attachment by "frothing" a cup of clean water for about a minute.  This will keep the nozzle clean. A clean nozzle will froth better and not blow off because it is clogged.
Issue #3 Water reservoir leaks in the machine.  After each use clean the filter and replace it on the machine after you have cleaned the frothing nozzle. Then run the machine as if you are making a cup of espresso until you drain the remaining water from the reservoir. Once dry, it cannot leak
The coffee basket from my old Mr. Coffee machine fit the Krups perfectly.  Never throw anything away!

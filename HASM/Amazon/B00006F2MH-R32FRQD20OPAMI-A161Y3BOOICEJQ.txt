Title: NEVER THE SAME COFFEE TWICE!!
Content:
I have to say that I bought this coffee pot with the idea that my coffee would be soooooo much better if I ground my own beans.....NOT TRUE!!! In fact, I can't make the same pot of coffee twice!!! I have been using the same beans every time and sometimes it is weak and other times it is strong!! The cleanup is not so bad, considering it grinds too, but the condensation from the hot water makes the coffee grinder a little messier than a separate grinder. I am ready to junk this one and buy a plain jane coffee maker and go back to my regular old grounds. It is too unpredictable and it's a little embarrassing when you have company....it looks like I don't know how to make a good cup of coffee. One last thing is that even though it is a 12 cup coffee maker, the amount of beans that you would need is more than fits in the grinder!!!

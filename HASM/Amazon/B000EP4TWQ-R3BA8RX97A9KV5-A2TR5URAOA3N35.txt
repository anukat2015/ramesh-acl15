Title: Unbelievably Small!!
Content:
First of all i must say i was impressed when i opened the box and sow how small it was. Its about as thin as a NO.2 pencil and until you hold it in your hands its hard to explain how small its is. The click wheel is really cool and is easy to scroll through songs and such. It also comes with a couple of simple games than can keep you entertained for a small while. The color screen is also great. Displays album art very well and displays pictures well also. The iTunes software is really easy to use and organizes your music very well.
There were only a couple of things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. Fisrt of all the scratches and finger prints show up very well on the black version so id recomend getting some of those silicone cases and also protect the screen. I rarely take mine out of the one i got for it. Secondly the battery is exactly the best ive seen but its good enough for me. Third, the headphone jack is on the bottom, not exactly a big problem but i find it weird having it on the bottom. 
In conclusion this is an awesome mp3 player you can take anywhere. Although 500 songs arent quite enough for me its still a great buy.
If you have a large music library i recomend getting the 4GB version which is only 50 bucks more, and ill probly do that after a while.

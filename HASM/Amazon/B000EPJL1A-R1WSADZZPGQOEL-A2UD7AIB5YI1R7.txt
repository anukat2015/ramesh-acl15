Title: iPod Shuffle is Great
Content:
The iPod is efficiently designed and easy to use.  The thumb control is simple and can be used without looking at it. The manual is written in English by an English-speaking person!  This is fairly remarkable, in the technology world.  I love my iPod so much, that I bought one for my partner.

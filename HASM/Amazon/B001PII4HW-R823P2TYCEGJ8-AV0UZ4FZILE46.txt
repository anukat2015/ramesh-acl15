Title: Would be great, if it worked....
Content:
Well, would be a great computer - if it worked....   Ordered the cute little red PC from Sony direct....   Would have been nice if they loaded the operating system on to the computer correctly.   It is hard to imagine how a PC can pass Sony quality control if Windows was not loaded.
Sony is going to take 10-14 days to replace it...   I have asked for a refund as I do not want to deal with Sony's poor customer service in the future.
Think long and hard about buying a Sony PC...  In this day where you can get a computer basically at your local 7-11, customer service matters as much as the quality of the hardware.  In my case, Sony Customer Service let me down.

Title: I bought this unit for my bedroom..
Content:
I have a larger bedroom, and this unit cooled my bedroom ok.. and my hallway if i leave my door open. It was a bit tricky to put together, my neighbor helped me.. and in a couple hours we'd put it together. Mine came with a remote.
It was heavy and difficult with 2 people to lift it into my window, and there is a gap on the bottom of it where alot of misquitos were getting in. I stuffed some foam padding in the gap and seemed to work to keep them out.. and i noticed once i did that it felt cooler. Chances are most of my cool air was escaping outside. 
I did need to place a fan in front of this unit because it was so far away from my bed i couldn't feel the air, i used my tall round oscilating floor fan and just aimed it at the bed. It works. Most of my issues are with the weather here (Texas) and not with the unit itself.. it's just super hot here.
It beats feeling like i'm having a heat stroke, only problem is i don't want to leave my bedroom.. lol. I will need to buy another for the other end of my house.

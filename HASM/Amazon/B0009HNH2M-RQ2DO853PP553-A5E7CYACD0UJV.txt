Title: Took this one back
Content:
Like a previous reviewer, I did not like the high-frequency motor whine.  I asked customer service for noise level information and they replied with "We don't have that information..." Called Hoover Corporate and left a message for the Safety Officer requesting noise levels and an octave band analysis (to determine the frequency of the whine). That was early Nov and still no response.  
The Hoover does a good job and has a very strong motor (hence the whine) but cheesey attachments. I also did not like the short cord and the location of the on/off button which is very easy to confuse with the cord return button. At the very least the buttons should be of different color. Somehow, I expected more from Hoover product engineering!
I returned the vac and purchased the canister recommended by a leading consumer product source as the "Best Buy."

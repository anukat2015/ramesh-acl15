Title: Quick & Easy
Content:
I bought this product to use in my newly purchased house.  I was hesitant to try it based on some of the reviews, but I am very glad I decided to get it!  My entire first floor is wood & ceramic floors and it did a GREAT job cleaning both.  I think the people having issues with puddles are not using it correctly.  You simply have to push the trigger when pushing forward and release when pulling backward.  I only wish that the clean & dirty compartments were a little bigger, but as far as the quality of cleaning, I would say go for it!  As far as the dry vacuum, it's not as good as a broom, but it picks up most things, it really is perfect for everyday cleaning.

Title: great little machine, great value
Content:
I bought this machine after looking at the not-so-good reviews of machines several times more expensive. This was a good decision, it is an awesome value for the price. It performs as advertised and makes great latte and capuccino. It does not have the automatic features of the more expensive machines, but for use maybe twice a day it does not really need it.
The fact that it also makes regular coffee is a nice bonus. The only little problem is that if you make more than 3 shots of espresso, you will run out of useful steam for steaming/frothing. Besides that, it is a great machine at an unbeatable price for casual espresso-lovers. I would definitely buy it again.

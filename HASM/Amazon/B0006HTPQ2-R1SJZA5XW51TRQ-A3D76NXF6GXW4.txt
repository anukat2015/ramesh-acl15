Title: Very Pleased
Content:
I was skeptical about buying one of these. I remeber the days that portable cassette players were big and portable cd players were about to be released. I really do like the fact that I am able to play 1000 mp3's, with out worrying about carrying a cd player around with tons of cd's (Not to mention Batteries) I have not had any problems with the ipod since it I got it. I was however shocked and stunned at how small and compact it is.

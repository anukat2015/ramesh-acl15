Title: 5 stars considering the price-point
Content:
I bought the e-520 for one simple reason... it has several mitigating features that allow for an overall system price break while still giving pretty good quality images.
Yes, I know that other cameras have an edge when it comes to digital noise, dynamic range and number of megapixels BUT from a practical, real-world shooting stand-point you can get great images from the Olympus E-520.
The fact that even Olympus's lower range of lenses are pretty good quality means that a person who is trying to scrimp can come up with a good "prosumer" camera system.
Consider this. You know that the drawback to Olympus's four-thirds sized sensors mean that there is SLIGHTLY more digital noise at higher ISO settings, right? Well the smaller sensor means that my 70-300 f4-f5.6 tele-zoom is really the 35mm equivalent of a 140-600mm!!!... And still at f4-f5.6!!! That's pretty good. And I spent WAY less then someone purchasing a 140-600mm.
Now... Image stabilization that is in the lens means that there is a premium added to the cost of the lens. Well, the E-520 comes with GREAT image stabilization in the camera body. No need to add that expense to the lens! Cool!
On top of that Olympus tends to price their cameras slightly lower than other similarly ranked cameras. AND they tend to put a couple other features in there for the price... like THE BEST sensor dust reduction system in DSLRs!!! Cool!
So far I'm quite happy with the E-520. If the E-620 had come along earlier I might have decided on that simply because of the higher mega-pixels. However, I've been quite happy with the image quality coming from this camera, "for the price-point".
Check out cameralabs dot com and search for this camera.

Still a great camera for the price but I would now strongly suggest the E620 unless the difference in price is just something you can't handle. I often find myself needing to crop in and I wish there were a higher resolution to do that with.
Also, do not be surprised if you use the 70-300mm zoom and see fuzzy images without a rock-steady tripod. At the 35mm equivalent of a 600mm lens there is not a lot of wiggle room to shoot hand-held, even with the image stabilization built-in.

Title: Wait for 6 - 8 Months Then Buy
Content:
Be careful. I returned three of the silver 160 GB iPod classics to the Apple store for the same apparent defect. All three of the iPods I took home seized up when I began to put large amounts of music on it. The problem happened when I hit about 10 GB of music. The iPod would go to the boot up screen and freeze. It would then make this loud clicking noise while the screen light turned on and off. It continued doing this until the battery ran out of power. When I took the last one back and demanded a refund the Apple store clerk suggested that it was a faulty USB port on my lousy Windows based PC. The problem is that one of my three iPods seized up on my work laptop and the others did it on my home PC. The final clincher was when the third one seized up and I read on the Apple website similar problems from other users. I believe Apple turned out this product too soon and either there are a high percentage that are very defective or there is an inherant design flaw in the system. I love my 60 GB iPod but it is nearly full and it has never had a problem. I will probably wait for 6 to 8 months and give Apple the chance to fix the problem before trying again. I recommend if you have problems demanding a refund from Apple and returning their poorly designed product to force them to address the issues.

Title: Great Radiators Heat Fans!
Content:
I purchased this heater for some friends (and their pets) who were staying with friends over the winter who had no other source of heat (not ideal.) This heater (and a lot of warm clothes and blankets) kept them all warm and safe in their room. I have a similar radiator-style portable heater and like it very much more than other types I've tried. I researched them first on Amazon and with consumer reporting groups to make my decision based on the safest and best-rated standards. This one turned out to deliver as promised. Thanks to the manufacturer and to Amazon reviewers for enabling me to safely help them!

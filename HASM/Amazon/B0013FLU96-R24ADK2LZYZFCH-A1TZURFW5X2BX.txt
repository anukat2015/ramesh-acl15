Title: Awesome
Content:
I am still discovering the MacBook Pro but so far it is amazing. I first love the 17" screen. It is so much better than my last 12" IBook which I really enjoyed for other reasons. The Macbook is so much faster and with the latest operating system;I love all of the new software included.
I am an artist and a lot of my workdeals with images and I photo has updated their software to include new and simpler ways of organizing and editing photographs.
There are many other features in which I have only grazed the surface. 
I highly recommend Getting the Mac Book Pro.

Title: Needs steroids
Content:
I'm sorry, but this unit makes very weak coffee.  I really wanted to like this thing, because of the great variety of coffee choices available, but many of them are just barely drinkable.  I have to go along with a reviewer on another site who said that it's OK the Keurig doesn't make a full mug, because you wouldn't want to drink a full mug of this stuff anyway.
This unit really, really needs some way to control the brew strength.
On the plus side, there are a few "extra bold" varieties, but just a few, so if you stick to those, you miss the major advantage of the Keurig.
My wife and I also noticed that all of the coffe made with the Keurig had a flavor element in common.  It's not quite a vending-machine flavor, but it's something that's not present in coffee made other ways.  
As I write this, I'm sitting here drinking a cup of brown dishwater, a.k.a. French Vanilla, and planning on returning the unit.  Looks like it's back to Taster's Choice Hazelnut instant for me.  Not a great coffee, but the flavor beats any of the K-cups and I can make it as strong as I like.

Title: Excellent Product!  I am so pleased with my IPod Nano!
Content:
This is my first IPod and I wasn't sure I wanted to go over to the Apple and I-Tunes side!  But I am so pleased with my purchase!   The price through Amazon was right, the delivery was quick, and the product is wonderful!  Very small, very light, very PINK, and with a lot of ways to keep me occupied while working, waiting for the bus or train or even doing chores.  I love that there's an FM radio, and the entire I-Tunes experience is very easy to understand and use.   I would definitely recommend this 5th generation IPod!

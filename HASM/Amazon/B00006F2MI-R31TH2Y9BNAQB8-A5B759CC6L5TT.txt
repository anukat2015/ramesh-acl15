Title: Not so good
Content:
The coffee maker itself is fine, and I like that it brews into a thermal pot so the coffee doesn't burn.  But the grinder being in the machine is just a horrible design -- what were they thinking?  
With the grinder in the machine, it gets wet, and any grinds that remain in the grinder stick to it, so after each use, you have to pull the grinder out, and the shoot where the grinds go through, and wash them both.  It's a real pain in the neck.
Cuisinart must have realized this after brewing their first pot of coffee in the test lab, but I guess at that point it was too late to do anything but sell it.  How aggravating.

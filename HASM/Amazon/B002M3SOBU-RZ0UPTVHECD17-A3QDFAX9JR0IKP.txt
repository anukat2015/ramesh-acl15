Title: Really great...except Apple has apps problems
Content:
I really liked it....until a few days after I got it and loaded apps...the apps would not open.  I went on Apple's website and they had thousands of complaints about the same thing with no answer to the complaints.  I figure if I spend $183 for a product...it should operate correctly.

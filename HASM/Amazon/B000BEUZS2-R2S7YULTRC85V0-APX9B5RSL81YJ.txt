Title: GREAT!!!!
Content:
Review based on my experience with the same heater I purchased last year/winter from a local store...
Pros:  
       Safety tip over off switch
       Comfort control thermostat
       Heats up a room like nobodies business
       Small compact size
       Cooling fan feature which helps cool off room/area during warm season
Cons:  
       Loud/noisy
Absolutely worth it especially if you have little children or animals running  about the home where there is a high probability it will get knocked over.  The tip over safety feature really put my mind at ease. Besides that, another huge plus was how much heat it gives off.  In order for me to be comfortable, I keep the thermostat on low/medium setting because on high it is suffocatingly hot....
So with the exception of it being rather noisy as it blows out warm air, it is a great buy.   Saves on your heating bill because instead of warming up the whole house you can just warm up the room you are in and with the thermostat it maintains that temp unlike other heaters without the thermostat control that continually blow air.   Very energy efficient!!!!
Highly recommend!!!

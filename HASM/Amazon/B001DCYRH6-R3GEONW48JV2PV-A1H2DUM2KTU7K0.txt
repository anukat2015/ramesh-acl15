Title: I don't understand the reviews
Content:
After reading all the reviews, I was convinced this was the vaccum for me.  It wasn't.  
It has no wheels and must be hand carried which is awkward to have both hands occupied while vaccuming.  The suction was good on tile and hardwood floors.  I have one small area of carpet.  The carpet head is NOT rotary, simply a double row of stiff brushes.  It was difficult drawing the carpet head across the carpet.  Actually, I had to vaccum with the pile direction to even be able to draw the carpet-head --- which does nothing to release the dirt in the carpet pile.  But, I'm still OK because I only have a minimal amount of carpet.
It came with multiple tools.  All of which are left behind because they are not 'on board'.  OK if one wants to run back and forth to switch out tools.  And storage is a problem unless one wants to put them in a bag someplace.
  
The last straw was the filter/bag.  It is poorly designed.  Dust collected around the seal and would drop to the floor upon opening the bag compartment.  The bag is some composite, clingy material (plastic/paper?)- making it difficult to shake out the dust.    It's a long cyclinder shape and one has to invert it to get the dust out.  It doesn't seem it would hold up to many water rinsings.  And, from my perspective, it would have to be cleaned with every use. 
 
The long cord was nice except one has to now manuever the cord while vaccuming.  Remember both hands are already occupied with carrying the unit and the vaccuming hose.
This was my first and last foray into the world of canister vaccums.

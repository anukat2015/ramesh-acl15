Title: Good for the Price
Content:
I bought this to replace my 3 year old Toshiba. 
Good points:
It is faster than my old one.
I like the bigger screen.
Bad points:
Touch pad too large, keep hitting it when I hit the space bar.
Tab bar too narrow, keep missing it 
The raised key board locaters (on F and J Keys) are too hard to find.
Too much advertising software (guess all manufactures are like that)
As others have stated, cord keeps falling out.
Over all it is a good average computer for the price.

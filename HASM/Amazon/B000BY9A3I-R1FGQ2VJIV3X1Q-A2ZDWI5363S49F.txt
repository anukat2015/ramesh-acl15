Title: Wonderful vaccum!
Content:
This is not my first canister vaccum and the last vaccum that we had was a regular push vaccum. I needed a vaccum that could clean the carpets and noncarpeted floors with ease and conveince and this vaccum does that.  I love the smaller head more, as it has rubber around the head, it is easy to use around furniture (no longer do I need to move the coffee table, the stools, etc.  The head is small enough to go under and around all the furniture.) I like how the power button is on the top of the handle, the handle is easy to hold, and makes it easy to rotate the head when vaccuming.  The cord could be a little bit longer, but that was trivial to me.  We have one thinner carpet, some regular carpets, and some shag type carpets, and the vaccum seemed to do great with all of them.  It was so easy to go from carpet to floor and I loved that! This vaccum saved me so much time and was just a lot easier to use than any of the vaccums I have had in the past.

Title: Cool Deal!
Content:
Eco-heater 602 High-Efficiency Electric Panel Whole-Room HeaterThese heaters are so hot they're cool!  A great heater for a dusty environment like a chicken coop.  We have two of these units in a 12' x 16' insulated building and were able to keep over 100 chicks nice and toasty for a few weeks while brooding in the early spring.  I have another type of heater in one of my other coops that I continuosly have to vacuum the dust off in order to prevent the whole place from going up in flames. Nothing like a little piece of mind!

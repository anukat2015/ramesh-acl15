Title: the little heat fan that could
Content:
This fan is very small.  At first glance it does not look as if it could heat a large room well but it does.  The fan truely is not digital.  It just has some lights at the top that glow when 4 different temparatures have been reached.  The cool touch feature works well.  The back of the fan actually blows out cool air that can be felt up to an inch away.  The shut off feature when tipping the fan works well too.  you only have to tip the fan a few inches for it to turn off.  One annoying feature about the fan is that after reaching a desired temperature the fan will turn on for a second and turn back off every now and then. I know for a fact that it isnt due to the fact it got the temperature back up because the air that comes out when it is on for one second is cool.  This can be avoided by just using the fan at full blast all the time. One who is purchasing one of these should also consider buying a humidifier as well. Due to the fact cold air holds less water than warm air things start to feel very dry in the room after the air warms up with no additional water in the room.

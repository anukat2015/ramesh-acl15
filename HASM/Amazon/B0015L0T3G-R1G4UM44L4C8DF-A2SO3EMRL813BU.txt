Title: love it!
Content:
I really love this mp3 player.  Its interface is really self explanatory, so even a non-tech person like me could figure it out.  It sounds great, even through cheap headphones, and there are tons of equalization options.  Ive dropped it on pavement about 10 times, and the screen got pretty scratched up, but it still works!  If you are the kind of person that tends to drop things, I would get a screen protector.  :)
The only minor inconvenience Ive found is having to run video and pictures through a converter.  Its really not a big deal though, you just have to wait a few extra minutes.
The video quality isn't amazing, but really, what are you going to be watching on a 1.9 inch screen anyway?  All I want to watch are music videos, and the quality is more than enough for that.
Overall, I highly recommend this player!

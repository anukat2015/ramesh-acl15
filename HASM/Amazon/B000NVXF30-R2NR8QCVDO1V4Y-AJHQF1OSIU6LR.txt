Title: A real winner from Olympus
Content:
Here are my initial thoughts on this Olympus. The E510 makes its predecessor (the E500) proud.   This camera will definitely keep the DSLR competition honest and only benefit us consumers!  I am thrilled to-date. (3 days with it)
PROS
* Image Stabilization
* Great Construction, feels well made
* Light weight (lighter than my friend's Pentax K100)
* Phenomenal Kit Lenses
* Lightning fast AF with 2 very good & light Zuiko kit lenses
* Image quality, lower noise at higher ISOs
* Great battery life (500+ photos in mixed shooting conditions)
* Image sensor dust removal (at bootup)
* Both CF and xD cards
CONS
* Not a con, but Live View is quirky.  When I use a DSLR I prefer to use the viewer, but I can see how some folks would LOVE to use the LCD. Its more of personal thing and if you dont want to use the LCD you just don't.
* No others yet

Title: Pretty cool!
Content:
This laptop overall is pretty cool. The sound isn't too good though, so I had to buy some speakers so I could hear when I watch videos. The invisible touch pad is very annoying and it is always messing me up so I would recommend using a mouse. The face detection is good in case you forget your password but it's faster just to type it out. I have a bunch of games installed on the computer and it still runs well. I like the alternating backgrounds. It's ability to connect to wireless networks is nice too. I haven't had any problems with that, either. Overall, I think the computer is well worth the $550.

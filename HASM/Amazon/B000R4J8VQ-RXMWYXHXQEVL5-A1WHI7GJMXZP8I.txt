Title: Started good, but later failed
Content:
When I first got this I was thrilled!  It made a great cup of coffee or tea, plus could be used to heat water for instant hot cereal.  After just 4 short months, it won't brew at all.  I tried cleaning it like the manual states, but no improvement.  I called Hamilton Beach and they will replace it for $11.99.  That is half of what I paid for it brand new!  I will be looking for a different model to replace this.  Too many people have complained about the same problem and I fear after a few more months, the replacement will die as well.  Save yourself money in the long run and go with something a little better the first time.

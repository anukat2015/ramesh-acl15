Title: Great photos, poor durability, no support
Content:
I am an amateur photographer who stretched a few years back to buy a Nikon D70 based on Nikon's reputation for quality and durability.  The camera has taken great photos, but recently had a shutter failure that Nikon is charging over $200 to fix.  Research shows this is a known issue with the Nikon D-series - no matter how good the images, if the camera only lasts a couple of years in light use, you do NOT want to spend a lot of money on it.  Forget Nikon - buy a Canon!

Title: Don't Buy This Camera at this price!
Content:
The D80 is a great camera, with which I have taken many pictures.  The description here is accurate...BUT BUT BUT--this model is superseded by the D90 in SO many ways.  And for some reason, right now on Amazon, a new D90 is selling for less than this D80.  That's insane. Everything the D80 can do, the D90 can do at least as well, and many things better, and you get video, too.  Indeed, the D80 is so old now, that in many ways, lower end Nikon DSLRs are superior (D40s, D60s, D5000s).  The only person who should buy a D80 at this price is someone who likes to burn money. In a just and fair world, the D80 would be priced around [...] bucks.  Then, you'd really have a decision to make--go with the updated D90, for double, or get a great camera at [...].
Again, it's a great camera, but someone is ripping you off at this price.

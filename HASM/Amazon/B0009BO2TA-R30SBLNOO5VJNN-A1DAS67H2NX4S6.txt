Title: Big disappointment
Content:
I bought this vacuum 14 months ago and it was a disappointment from the start. I was too lazy to bring it back to the store but I've finally given up on it. Now the power cord can no longer be pulled out of the machine so it's pretty much unusable. The main problems with are the following: 
- Cheap plastic construction (e.g. wheels go flying off, pieces break, etc).
- Weak suction. (That's a pretty fundamental problem for a vacuum!)
- The hose, telescoping chrome wand and carpet/floor nozzle constantly separate. No matter how much force you use to attach them, the pieces pull apart constantly while vacuuming. It's very frustrating. More than once I've had to resist the urge to throw this contraption out the window.
My recommendation: spend a little more money and get a real vacuum cleaner.

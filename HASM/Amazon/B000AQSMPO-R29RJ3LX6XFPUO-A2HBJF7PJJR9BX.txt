Title: K-Cup Design Inferior to T-Disc
Content:
The B60's implementation of the K-Cup concept is OK, with the possible exception of the preparation time for the water if the unit isn't left running, and the noise of operation.  The T-Disc units do not require preheated water inside the unit (therefore faster to brew) and they are comparatively quiet.
My main problem is with the K-Cup concept.  First, there are no bar-codes on the K-Cups as there are on the T-Discs, so the unit does not know what it is brewing and cannot vary the amount of water, frothing, etc., depending on what you're making.  But this doesn't really matter because the B60 only makes coffee --- no espresso, no lattes, no cappuccinos.  That wasn't clear to me from reading about it.  I also have the Bosch T-Disc machine, and it makes all of these drinks:  All of my coffee-shop favorites like chai lattes, mochas, pumpkin spice lattes, gingerbread lattes (by adding syrup), etc.  Just be aware that the K-Cup machines will only make coffee.  Therefore it is essentially just a single-cup coffee maker without the cleanup of using a regular coffee maker.  If that is what you want, then I suppose K-Cups are fine, albeit overly expensive for a simple coffee maker.

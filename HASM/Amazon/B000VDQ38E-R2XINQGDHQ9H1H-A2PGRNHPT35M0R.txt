Title: LIKE THE POWER * A LITTLE CLUNKY* READ WHY?
Content:
Just got this vac today.   I put the Bissell together in about 5 minutes with a Philips and was ready to go. Very powerful propelling forward. Cord is a nuisance for sure.  Very heavy machine but when you have kids and pets that shed you can not get a light weight stream lined machine that will hold up. So far, I am impressed with the suction and how nice my carpets look. This vac transitions well onto wood floors which is important to me. You have to empty dirt container often.   Bissell recommends emptying after each use and to check filters once a month.  One filter is washable but the hepa filter is not. There is also a pet hair lifter for carpeted surfaces which I am starting to like on carpets. What I do not like about it is when the pet hair lifter is up like on wood floors it is hard to get under furniture and the button protrudes a bit high causing the front of the vac to be bulky and not as sleek as needed to slide under objects. You can not tell this from the picture because they show it down. The price is very good for this vacuum worth trying out with all the  good reviews. I am definitely undecided because of the pet hair lifter. I could not give it a 3 star because it does work great so far on the carpets,hard wood and stairs.

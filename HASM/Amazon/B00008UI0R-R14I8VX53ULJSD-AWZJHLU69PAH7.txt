Title: Ridiculously Small Capacity
Content:
As others have noted, the dust cup holds very little and needs to be emptied frequently. It is deceiving, since the cup itself appears to be quite large, but it is *full* when the dirt reaches just over an inch deep in the cup (this does not take long on a wool area rug). Emptying the cup is easy, but the internal chamber design traps stuff (static cling) so it does not fully empty unless you resort to rinsing it out or reaching in there (yuk). 
It would be nice if the connection of the handle and beater bar would swivel to help it turn corners. 
The *powered* hand tool is not powered with a motor, rather it uses the suction to spin the sweeper. Surprisingly, it does work and did not stall out. 
The variable suction is nice, but it is a bit slow to respond.

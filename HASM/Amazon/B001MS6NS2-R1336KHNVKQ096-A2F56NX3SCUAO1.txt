Title: I LOVE SONY VAIO'S
Content:
I HAVE TWO SONY VAIO LAPTOPS AND HAVE NEVER HAD A SINGLE PROBLEM. I KEEP UP ON VIRUS PROTECTION AND WINDOWS UPDATES ALONG WITH DISK CLEANUP AND DEFRAGMENT AND THEY STAY FAST AND RELIABLE. I CAN DO ANYTHING FROM SELLING ON EBAY TO WRITING MY ARTICLES. MY FAVORITE COLORS ARE CROCODILE BROWN AND WHITE. THEY ARE THE MOST AWESOME LAPTOPS I'VE EVER OWNED. I HAVE TWO BECAUSE MY SPOUSE AND I BOTH USE THEM OFTEN...
I HAVE FOUND THAT I CAN DO JUST AS MUCH ON MY LAPTOP AS ON MY DESKTOP. IF I NEED SOMETHING PRINTED I JUST EMAIL IT TO MY DESKTOP, HOWEVER SOMEDAY I WOULD LIKE TO GET A WIRELESS PRINTER FOR IT.
I THINK THERE IS A WAY TO NETWORK THEM TOGETHER TO USE THE MAIN PRINTER I HAVE, BUT I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THAT. ANY COMMENTS WELCOME IF YOU KNOW HOW :)

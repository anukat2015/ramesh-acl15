Title: Quality but lacking on heat
Content:
This is a well built heater; cool to the touch, and very stylish. It is quite expensive, has remote control, but just doesn't put out enough heat compared the the Holmes heater at a fraction of the cost. They designed the vortex to only produce 120 degree heat and that just doesn't get the job done. The Holmes feels much warmer and is also cool to the touch!

Title: Dyson Canister Vacuum
Content:
The Dyson canister is by far the best vacuum I have ever owned. I am able to clean areas I could never get at with my uright. It cleans right up to the wall edge and under the coffee table. It stores away in a very small space. Plenty of suction , nice long hose makes it easy to reach around furniture. Heppa filter never needs replacing and no bags to buy makes it a good value in the long run. All that and a 5 year warranty.

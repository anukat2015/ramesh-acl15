Title: Heat
Content:
Bought this about 3 weeks ago. It still smells a bit. Smelled really bad for the first 2 weeks. Leaving in on full blast for 3 or 4 hrs doesn't really get rid of the smell like the manual suggests. Apart from the smell it is easy to use, it is reasonably cheap, it heats very well for it's size.

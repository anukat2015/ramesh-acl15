Title: HORRIBLE RELIABILITY !!
Content:
This is the 2nd one that has died in about a year(previous year model).  I thought it was just a fluke the first one died after about 100 uses/one year but this is the second one that when I pushed on the water began to heat up and then pop the computer/clock went blank.  I'm not a die hard Black and Decker fan but I do have quite a few of their tools and they are reliable but this thing is by far the worst.  HORRIBLE RELIABILITY !!

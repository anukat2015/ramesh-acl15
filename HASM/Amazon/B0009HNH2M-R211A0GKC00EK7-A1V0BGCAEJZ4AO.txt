Title: Complete Junk
Content:
I purchased a refurb from Allergy Be Gone through Amazon. The power floor attachment would not stay on the very first day. It would come off at the slightest touch of an object. Worse yet, the hose came apart (tore) from the rubber flange, making the thing completely useless. I bought it for my vacation home and used it three, yes count them, three times total. After the first vacuuming, the power floor attachment had to be duct taped to stay on. The third time I used it, the canister tipped over and when I uprighted it, I found the hose broke. What JUNK! DO NOT BUY AT ANY PRICE!!!!

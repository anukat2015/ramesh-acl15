Title: not worth the price
Content:
i brought this coffee maker last year , and last year i had to send it back because it would not finish brewing. so they made send back the broken one and a couple of weeks later i received it, well the coffee maker is not working again , and its the same thing the dang cofee maker will not finish brewing, its like i have to turn it on 4 times for it to finish brewing. i really think for the price of this maker we should not be having these kind of problems, so i would say to anyone thinking of buying this dont!!!
look elsewhere , its not worth it.

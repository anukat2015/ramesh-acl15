Title: Fast and warm
Content:
All I wanted was something that would heat up quickly and look good.  Mission accomplished. 
I had purchased a few of the DeLonghi Safe Heat white egg-shaped heaters a couple of years ago and found them fantastic. Thought I'd try the ceramic variety to see if it made a difference in the time it took to warm up a room, or the  quality of the heat.  Frankly, I can't see or feel any difference, and the DeLonghi is less expensive and goes well with any decor.
Both products are great.

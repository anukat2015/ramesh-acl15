Title: I am happy with my new computer
Content:
I enjoy using my sony VGN-NW280F, very easy to use specialy with it wireless capability.
Fast enough to open any application at the same time.
I love the beutiful feature and the one that suprised me is the system cooling system, I've run the computer for several hours with the charger on. The system still with in tolerable temperature.
Access to the internet is very easy. I enjoy wacthing blue ray movie by conecting the computer to the telivision and watching high definition movie.
I will be waiting this year for sony to come out with the new intel quad 4 microprocessor with a ddr3 memmory.

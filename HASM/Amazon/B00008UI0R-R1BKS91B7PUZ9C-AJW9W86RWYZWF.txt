Title: I DON'T MIND VACUUMING NOW
Content:
I received my Hoover 3 days after ordering. Amazon is excellent to order from.  So is the vacuum.  Several reviews i read said the dust canister was too small.  i didn't find this to be true.  i had vacuumed with my old canister 2 days before my new one arrived. used the new one and with 4 cats did not find the canister filled up too quickly. but it was simply amazing tp see what it picked up that my old one didn't.  floor brush works great as does the stair attachment.  highly recommend to anyone wanting a canister.  plus - it almost self-propels itself.  GREAT VACUUM, especially for the price.

Title: Biggest piece of crap I've ever spent money on.
Content:
I bought this product 2 weeks ago to deal with the doghair my dog produces with abandon.  It won't pick up anything--just pushes it around.  My old Hoover upright picked up in one pass what this vacuum blew around the room.  This is the second Bissell product I've bought, and I'll never buy another.  I had similar problems with a carpet shampooer--it didn't perform even to my lowest expectations.

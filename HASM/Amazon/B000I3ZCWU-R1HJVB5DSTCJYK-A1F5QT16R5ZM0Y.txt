Title: It has been good for one and a half month until the charger burned
Content:
I will come back to modify this review when I hear the result from either J&R or Canon.
I was doing a ten day trip and shot a lot of pictures. So I bascially charged two batteries every other day alternatively. Unfortunately, the fourth or fifth time the charger just went bad. I had to shoot pictures very selectively.
When I came back, I sent an email to J&R and they asked me to call Canon service since my charger is still under warranty. So I called canon, and was very disappointed to be told that the charger was not covered in warranty!
The rep kept asking me whether the charger was damaged when I received it! I am trying to contact with both J&R and canon and see how this got resolved.

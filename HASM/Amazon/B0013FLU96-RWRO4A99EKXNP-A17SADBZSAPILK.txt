Title: MacBook Pro--Mostly Good
Content:
I replaced my five year old iBook with this MacBook Pro because I did not want the glossy screen of the new MacBook and because the Amazon price after rebate for the early 2008 version of the Pro was close to the price I would have had to pay for the late 2008 MacBook.
The Pro is a great machine and, of course performs much better than my old iBook except in one respect--wireless reception. My iBook never had any issues anywhere in the house. The Pro is MUCH weaker. At first I thought the Pro was defective, but after a call to AppleCare and a visit to the Apple Store Genius, I saw that it just required a stronger signal. Since I don't take my laptop out of the house, that's not as big an issue for me as it might be for others. 
I've repositioned my modem/router and I'm considering buying a 'n' router to replace my 'g' version, hoping it will work better.
I do think that Apple should have been more attentive to wireless performance. I'm wondering if the new metal-cased MacBooks will have the same weak-kneed wireless reception.

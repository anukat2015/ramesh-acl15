Title: Good little heater, not what I expected
Content:
OK, i did alot of research on heaters that would be portable yet effective, and i finally went with this one. Dont get me wrong, this heater does heat and blow hot air, but its pretty much just a spot heater. After leaving it in my small bedroom for about 2 hours, it did make the temp go up, but not by much. In my living room, this thing is a joke and pretty much needs to be 3 feet or closer to me to give me any form of heat. Buy this if you need it for small enclose spaces, otherwise pass on it and get something a little stronger.

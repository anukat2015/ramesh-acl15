Title: SLR Digital Masterpiece!
Content:
I am a novice to experienced camera user. I have to say that the idea of buying a camera of this magnitude was daunting from the standpoint of all the terminology I would have to learn to better use the unit. The documentation takes care of that and is easy to understand. The on screen menu on the very large LCD is easy to use. The two lenses that came with the camera are the basic package where photographing small and large objects close and far away are concerned. Its really all here except it didn't come with a memory card, which I found not to be a big deal, because the capacity will largely be matter of personal preference. I opted for an 8.0 GB card with is more than adequate for capturing over 3000 images. The 8.1 Megapixel clarity is more than I've ever had in the way of a camera so maybe I'm just a bit dazzled right now, but the first photos I took for some product shots were clear beyond anything I've seen yet. All in all, with the combination of taking a digital photography class to better get most out of the unit, I would have to say this was positive experience. One would have to be a total pro looking for subtle nuances in a camera to not be happy with this camera. It feels good in the hand not small-ish like the Canon EOS, which when the shutter snaps actually jolts the camera causing a recoil-the body is so light.

Title: Bad design for bean grinder.
Content:
This product was a terrible disappointment.  Every time you grind beans for a pot of coffee moisture goes back up into the grinder.  You have to clean the sludge out of grinder every time.  This is a flawed design and Cuisinart Customer Service could care less.  There are many other brands on the market without this problem. I would not buy this product again.

Title: Amazing
Content:
The Zune is way more than I expected. Sure, it doesn't offer much the iPod hasn't offered before (just the WiFi and FM) but you have to try it for yourself. The interface is great and very intuitive. It took me about 1 minute to figure out all its features. I didn't have any problems with the software or to synchronize it. It's actually very fast! It took it about 1-2 seconds per song. Although the screen is just half an inch larger than the iPod's looks way better. Very bright and sharp image, like an XBRITE LCD.
The integration with Zune Marketplace is perfect. Very smooth and easy to use. I subscribed to the Zune Pass option ($14.99 plus tax) which gives you unlimited songs in up to three PCs and syncronization to up to two Zunes.
Beware of all those 1-star reviews of people who haven't even used it! You have to try it for yourself. I'm loving mine!

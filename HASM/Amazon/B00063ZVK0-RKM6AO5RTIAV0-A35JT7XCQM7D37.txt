Title: I bought two more after liking the first so well
Content:
I've read the various reviews.  I can't comment on the experience of other people, but here's mine.  I have a bathroom that can be quite chilly, and I thought I'd see if a Vornado would help.  It did.  In fact, I liked it so well, that I bought one for my elderly parents, who tend to be cold almost all the time.  They use it regularly, both in their TV room, and in the bathroom.  It's quite light and easy to transport, so they do.  THEN I decided to take my bathroom Vornado to work, since we had some "thermostat wars" going on and my office would suddenly turn frigid because someone else was too warm.  It worked again.  So I bought a third for the bathroom.   Nary a problem.  It's quiet.  It heats smoothly and circulates the heat as claimed.   As a result the room gets gently warmer, not the three feet of space in front of the heater.  With three units purchased at different times, I would think I would have come across one of the defective ones that others have complained about, but I have not had that happen to me.   I am very pleased.

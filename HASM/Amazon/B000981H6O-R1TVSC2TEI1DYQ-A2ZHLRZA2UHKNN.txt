Title: Ok Product for the price
Content:
The product overall was "ok" not the greatest considering it is a Hoover. Battery does tend to die very easily. I tried using this to vaccum my car floor and was unsuccessful with the little things -- (purpose of what I bought it for). Does great sucking up gunk after sweeping on my pergo floors - but again the hole is a bit too small therefore the suction power is not the greatest. I have had other machines that worked better. Note there are no attachments so that is not so great. The charging station is flimsy and kind of pointless unless you plan on hanging it up - otherwise the cord is all you need. Good Luck -- I wouldnt buy it again --

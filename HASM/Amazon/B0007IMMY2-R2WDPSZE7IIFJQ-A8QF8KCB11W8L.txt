Title: Apple's newest and greatest!!
Content:
I have had nothing but fun with my iPod Shuffle! I cannot say how much I love haveing the controls on the cord of the earphones.( no I do not sweat). One drawback though: The battery life is simply disgusting. I have to charge it EVERY OTHER DAY! I bought mine at WALMART so I cannot say anything for or against Amazon.
I can also use it when I shovel snow and to drown out the noise of other people talking. I comment Apple for giving me an inexpensive, enjoyable, and superportable music experience with the iPod Shuffle 2GB Silver 4th Generation NEW MODEL. Thank you again Apple!

Title: Optimus H-5210 quartz radiant heater review
Content:
It is a good thing I waited well over a month to give my review for this product... because it will be much different now.  I was very happy with how the heater performed at first, especially given the low cost. Seemed well worth it, and I am sure for most future customers it will be.
However, it lasted me all of 2-3 weeks before literally dying on me OUT OF NOWHERE. I cannot stress this enough. I am very careful and meticulous person, and I am 100% positive that the heater was never dropped, exposed to water, or anything of the sort. It worked one day, and the next it simply wouldn't turn on.
I tried using almost every outlet in my house. Nothin doing. Thankfully this happened within a month's time so I could still return it. I bet some others may not have been so lucky.
Like I said, I was initially happy with the purchase. It seems I just happened to get a "bad egg" so to speak.  Given all the other positive reviews, I feel like the odds are if you buy this heater you will be satisfied (for the price).... but I have to give it one star due to my own personal experience.

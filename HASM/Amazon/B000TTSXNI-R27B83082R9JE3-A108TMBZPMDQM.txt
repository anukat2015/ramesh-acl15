Title: Not what I expected
Content:
I've purchased several Lasko heaters in the past and this didn't meet my expectations.
1. Make sure you verify there is a "Digital" readout on the temp. settings! This one has a bar that isn't very visible.
2. To lower the temp., you have to use the remote. (Unless you want to step thru all the higher settings until the unit finally reverts back to the lower settings.
3. The temp. settings are in increments of 5, so no setting the unit at anything else. (Example: 70 or 75 w/no possibility of setting at 72)
Other than the above, unit works great!

Title: Very QUIET & Very EFFECTIVE
Content:
As the title states, Very QUIET & Very EFFECTIVE!
Very happy with this purchase.
For ~$44 delivered in 2 days, it helped warm my condo's 12x12 bedroom w. a full wall that is a 10' floor to ceiling window.
I never realized how effective these type of small space heater were to supplement an ineffective central HVAC.
But after comparing this to my brother's Delonghi which was noisier; this was just sooo superior in warm heating performance & quietness & what ultimately prompted me to write this review.
If you are on the fence, just wait till the price comes back to $44 then take all these positive reviews as gospel.
This is 100% bulletproof purchase.

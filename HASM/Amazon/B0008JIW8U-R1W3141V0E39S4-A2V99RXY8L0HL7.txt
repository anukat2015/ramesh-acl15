Title: Nice Little Coffeemaker
Content:
I've had mine for a few months and it continues to please.
If I were to have one critcism, it's that it takes longer than average to brew a pot of coffee. Considering that it only needs to brew 4 cups, I find this odd. The Cuisinart that was replaced took a lot less time to brew a pot.
Some people have mentioned the clock losing time. I haven't found that to be the case.
All in all, for twenty bucks, this is a very good coffeemaker.

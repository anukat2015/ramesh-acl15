Title: a little off topic
Content:
I ordered this heater for around $24 from amazon.com and needed quickly due to the fact that all local walmarts and other stores are completely sold out of space heaters due to the extreme cold weather recently here in Florida.  I purchased overnight shipping for an additional $25 and did not receive my order the next day.  I am very upset and unpleased with the service from amazon.com.  You would think a billion dollar company could ship something overnight correctly especially when you pay a high amount for shipping.  next time I will def go with a different company.

Title: Far Better Than I Had Imagined!
Content:
I have had an iPod ever since they came onto the scene. But I only had the 30GB and I needed more space for my music collection and I did not want to go out and buy the 160GB iPod Classic and the iPod Touch 32GB is just to expensive for my tastes and does not offer any more storage. So I was set on getting the iPod 80GB but I had heard about the Zune 80GB by Microsoft so I thought I owed it to myself to check it out. 
Both were evenly matched in terms of price, although if I had wanted to get a refurbished iPod 80GB I could have for $200 on the Apple website, that is a whole $40 cheaper than what Amazon is charging for the Zune. But alas I am writing a review for the Zune since I did end up choosing it. If one is in a similar situation. I would just say this. If you are someone who is buying an iPod just to be trendy, do not buy anything at all until you can think for yourself. But if you are looking for tons of addons maybe you should by the iPod. But the Zune is slowly creeping new addons all the time. Plus all the features the Zune 80 has compared to the iPod 80 is just a win hands down. I enjoy Microsoft being the underdogs, they give you a superior product.

Title: Poor construction, faulty compressor, will never buy again.
Content:
I have had 3 of these units over the past 3 years; however, I only purchased one of them.  I purchased this item about 3 years ago.  It worked great for about 8 months.  I didn't even have to drain the water.  It just worked.  Then, the compressor blew out.  Because it had a 5 year warranty on the compressor, I called the company, and they actually sent me out a new unit.  I can definitely say that my experience with their customer service was great.  So, I got the new unit a few days later, plugged it in, but the compressor on that one did not work, so they went me my third one, which was about a year ago.  Today, the compressor on that one went out.  
In addition, there is a very significant design flaw.  When you do have to drain the water from the unit, the drain is almost on the bottom of the unit.  When you unplug the hole in order to attach the drainage pipe, water leaks (floods) out of the unit.  My carpet has been soaked numerous times over the past year.  For anyone who does actually buy this unit, I would recommend (1) build a box about 6 inches high which is large/strong enough to place the unit on top of, (2) connect the drainage hose permanently (use duct tape if you have to, that's what I did), (3) place a bucket at the back of the unit and put the other end of the drainage hose into the bucket.  This way, the unit can drain continuously and you don't have to worry about it flooding the carpet or floor when you pull out the plug when it is full.  Just let it drain continually.

Content:
I bought this product in February, 2007 even though it was more than I usually spend because I thought it would last.  The brand, Cuisinart, is a well known brand.  I had good luck until last week when it just stopped working.  When I mentioned this to a coworker, she said she had the same coffeemaker and hers stopped working just like mine this month!! I guess it's better not to spend that much for a coffeemaker if you are going to have to replace it in such a short time.

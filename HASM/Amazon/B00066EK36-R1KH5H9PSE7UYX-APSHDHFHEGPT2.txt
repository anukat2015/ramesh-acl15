Title: Great Product
Content:
Lets just put it this way: I accidently put this MP3 player through the wash and it came out working just as good as it did before.  Thats right, it went through the washer and then the dryer and it still works!  So, based on that I'm extatic about the quality of the product and would buy from SanDisk again!

Title: Asus K501J-D2 15.6-inch laptop
Content:
Other than me trying to get "used" to Windows 7, I am an XP Pro DieHard, I have had zero problems with this computer.  I have never owned a notebook/laptop before, so I don't really have anything to compare it to.  I am using it mostly for surfing the web and streaming  movies/TV shows to the HDTV.  We ditched the satellite dish. (2 much $$ for 2 Many stations we never watch anyway.)  And for this purpose it is doing just great.
   I chose the ASUS Brand because my Daughter and her husband had just purchased an ASUS Netbook to use on their honeymoon to Italy and because of the excellent ratings in Consumer Reports on the ASUS Brands, it appears that ASUS is an up and coming computer company.....

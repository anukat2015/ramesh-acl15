Title: What did you do Apple?
Content:
I really liked the new look, the storage capacity, and the features...until I found out that neither my car stereo system or my home sound deck will charge the unit.  Apparently you can only charge this generation using USB.
I returned it.  I can't imagine that Apple would do this and nullify thousand's of stereos out there when it comes to charging capability.  
Apple, fix this and I will buy the next generation.  Until then, I will buy used earlier models.

Title: Great price for shoddy manufacturing.

SPT SH-1508 Tower Ceramic Heater with Ionizer
I would have to give this rating a one star unfortunately. THe heater while in itself is a great cost you must be warned of the manufacturing of the product itself. I have two of these heaters purchased within a few weeks of each other. One worked well, we were so pleased that we ordered another (my roomies and myself) unfortunately the first one came broken, making a horrible clicking sound and the company (SPT)has refused to help. Amazon did send a replacement for the first and then the second one arrived making an horrible buzzing noise. Amazon was not willing to replace this one. Today is the 8th week of owning both the heaters. THe first one's face plate caught fire today because of poor wiring used in the assembly of the heater, and the second one I am afraid will do the same. This product almost set fire to my house and everything that we own.
I cannot reccomend this product to anyone. Although the price is fine (money wise) is it really worth risking far much more than sixty something dollars if it costs you your life? I do not think so. I am so upset by this that I will write to amazon.com today strongly recommending that this product be removed from their site. Because if three products have thus far been malfunctioning who knows how many more of these are out there will similar situations. So far I have found over 200 similar stories about this product. Thank you for your time and I wish you the best of luck in finding whateever it may be that you are looking for.
Happy Holidays everyone.

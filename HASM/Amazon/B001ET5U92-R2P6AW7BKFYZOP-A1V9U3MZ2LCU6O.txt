Title: Best value and more than enough room for creativity; Pro camera for amateurs and wannabees
Content:
I upgraded from a D60 (which I sold easily on Amazon's Marketplace)for two reasons. I wanted more control of functions and I wanted to have more lenses available with the autofocus functionality. This is a well designed and fully equipped camera. Easy to improve on it; just add good lenses. I suggest a good wide angle (8 or 10 mm, manual focus will work), a wide-angle zoom (suggestion: tamron, sigma or tokina in the 10-35 mm range) and a zoom such as the Nikon VR 55-200, plus a teleconverter (2X from Kenko) and you have the ability to shoot all kinds of pictures. A sigma 50 mm macro lens will allow for close up. About the camera: very easy to set up and extremely easy to operate; just read the small booklet to get started. Some variations to explore later are to set up the quality of image capture (regular or RAW, at different resolutions) and the ability to shoot single pictures or a sequence, with or without exposure bracketing. In brief a camera for people who know all these details or want to or care to learn.
Picture quality is very good and handling, battery life and LCD images are very good. I had a great experience with D60 and expect similar dependability and reliability but will update this later.

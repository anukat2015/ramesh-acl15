Title: my best friend Carina
Content:
I have Carina for 9 months. We are family of 4 + cat+ house business, so I have to vacuum every day ! It picks up everything: dust from the moldings and furniture, food left overs from my toddler's highchair and the floor around it, even liquids ! I use a wood floor tool the most, it's perfect. 
Yes, those replacing bags goes fast, but it's ok for me, since the vacuum is very strong, quiet, no bad odor.Vacuuming is a pleasure with good quality tool !
updating nov. 19 of 2009. Vacuum works perfect, I'm very happy I have it. My friend is buying the same one after trying mine.

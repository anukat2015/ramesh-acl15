Title: Fast, but screen leaves something to be desired
Content:
Bought this for my wife, who needed a laptop for portability. She plays a lot of games, particularly WoW and casual games, so I wanted something with a dedicated graphics card and a strong processor. Having an i7 CPU and 6 GB of RAM, the laptop offers plenty of performance headroom, no problems there.
PROS: Fast CPU, lots of RAM, hard drive big & fast, nice keyboard with automatic backlighting, decent build quality.
CONS: LCD far too milky with poor contrast. Simply a par screen, suitable for a laptop at the lower end of the spectrum, not at the near-premium level. Merely adequate, which is surprising for Sony.

Title: Loved it until it broke, but replaced under warranty
Content:
I really liked this unit, it made great coffee, but after owning it for 9 months it completely died. Initially we had to unplug it then  replug it in to get it working and that lasted about a month and a half, then finally it quit working all together. However the customer support was great, they asked for the model number and the serial number, then shipped me a brand new one.  I was really happy about this because I believe this coffee maker is the best one on the market and I would recommend it to anyone.

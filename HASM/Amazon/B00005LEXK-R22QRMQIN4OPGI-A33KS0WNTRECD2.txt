Title: Mr. Heater triple burner
Content:
The triple burner Mr. Heater delivers excellent heat. It lights easy, but a electronic ignition would be nice. Gas usage is close to the specs listed. My only complaint like one of the other reviewers listed, some of the burners will shut off sometimes for no reason on low heat. Maybe i just need to adjust the thermocouples.

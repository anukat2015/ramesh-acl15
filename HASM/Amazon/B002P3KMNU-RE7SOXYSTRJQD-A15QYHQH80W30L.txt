Title: Just as advertised! Trackpad is BAD!
Content:
This laptop took me time to decide....when I took the plunge I wasn't disappointed at all. The screen is just much brighter than the older generation LCD's  because this is an LED screen hence uses less energy adding up to more than 10hrs of use without having to charge the battery. This unit is simply awesome....I am planning to get the 12.1" screen as my travel companion. If there is anything that needs to be improved....it's the webcam...the resolution is not as crisp as I would want it to be..
UPDATE!
I wonder why this trackpad is so jumpy...while you type the cursor just keeps on jumping from one place to the other....I absolutely hate it....is there anybody here who knows how to fix this??

Title: A heater that doesn't...
Content:
I just received, and scheduled a return for this heater. Right out of the box it doesn't get above 80 degrees heat output (checked with an HVAC thermometer.) In comparison, I tested an old Lakewood heater, model 792/jr (http://www.amazon.com/Lakewood-792-JR-Forced-Utility/dp/B000BWNPRW) and the Lakewood easily reached 151 degrees heat output. The Vornado is a bit quieter than the Lakewood, but that's the only up-side.
Oh, and I agree with the postings about the Vornado fan; I've had mine for 5+ years, and it's still going strong!

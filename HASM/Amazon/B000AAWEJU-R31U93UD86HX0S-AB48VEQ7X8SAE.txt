Title: Great Vacuum!
Content:
I have had this vacuum for a year now (a wedding gift to myself).  I use it on carpeted, wood and linoleum floor surfaces along with an area rug.  It's super quiet and I haven't had any problems with it.  Also, the compact size is really nice.  Before I bought it online, I went to a local store and tried it out.
We always had the standard $75 upright vacuum from walmart/target/kmart growing up and my mom ended up replacing them almost every year... I was wanting something that was better quality and would last longer.  So far, so good!

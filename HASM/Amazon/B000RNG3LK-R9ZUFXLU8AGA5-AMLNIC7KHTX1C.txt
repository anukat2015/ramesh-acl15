Title: Aggravatingly SLOW machine!!
Content:
I can't even stand to work on this computer because it is so slow.  I use my 4 year old Dell desktop instead whenever possible because it is twice as fast.  I don't know what the problem is...maybe another GB of RAM is needed to run vista.  It takes about 90 seconds to open a WORD document, or an Outlook email.  It is a nice looking machine with a great display and keyboard.  The performance is the only problem for me.

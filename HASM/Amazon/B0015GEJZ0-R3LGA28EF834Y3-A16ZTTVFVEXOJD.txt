Title: Pentax K20D 14.6MP Review
Content:
Pentax K20D 14.6MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction (Body Only)
We are amateur photo shooters and have a 5 year old digital Kodak - which was okay for snap shooting - 
Now for the PENTAX K20D 14.6MP Digital Camera we offer this review.  
It is the TRUE amateur's friend.  It is in a completely different class to the old technology, including 35mm film format.  It is way ahead in the performance field for its class of digital camera.  We are glad to be back in the SLR type of camera too.
Right after arrival of our new K20D camera we did a PROM photo session on our patio with 5 couples - what a pleasure to shoot when you have the time right - what is the right time? - a series of shots 2, 3, 4 or 5 with each setting and this camera is so fast you can outshoot the point and shoots by a mile - and great results too - Our daughter was assisting with her PENTAX K10D and both of these DIGITAL CAMERA'S are recommended highly by us.  We experienced a number of comments from others sharing in this event, what kind of camera is that?  It must be nice to be able to take so many shots and capture all of these special moments!  They are right - we have over 300 perfect shots to brag about from this session, and two cameras captured those images.
The camera settings are easy to study and learn.  You can adjust so many different ways in just seconds and get the perfect results you desire, snap a test shot, view - then capture images of one of a kind, ones that you can truly enjoy viewing plus brag on after a shooting session. 
We use the SanDisk 4 GB Extreme III SDHC Card and the write speed is awesome for this camera.  We bought a Metz 58 AF-1 TTL Shoe Mount Flash for Pentax & Samsung SLR Cameras for our camera and makes a great match with the Pentax DA 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 ED AL IF Lens. 
This K20D is the camera for the money as we see it, study the features, it's loaded with them and you will see this is a fine camera that will deliver what you want in the photographic world - We highly recommended this product from PENTAX.

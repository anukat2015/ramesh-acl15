Title: Well built
Content:
The design of this camera is well constructed all the features is at your finger tips. The camera is a bit small for my grip but with the battery grip in place it is sensational. I just recieved my xti and was very pleased. The software that came with it works like a charm. The downloads from the camera is very fast. This was a very pleasing buy.

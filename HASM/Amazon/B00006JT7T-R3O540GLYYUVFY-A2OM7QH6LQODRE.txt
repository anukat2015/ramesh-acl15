Title: Exceptional unit for the price
Content:
I operate an animal rescue (African hedgehogs) where room temperature is very important.  I use three of these heaters at the rescue for supplemental heating at the floor level in our external building (The Hedgiehouse) and the Dispensary (in the lower level of our home).  All three have worked remarkably well over the last four years, especially when the outside temperature fell to levels where the heating system in the external building could not handle the cold (20 below zero).  The units have proven safe, quiet, and the thermostats reasonably manageable - certainly better than other space heaters we have tried.

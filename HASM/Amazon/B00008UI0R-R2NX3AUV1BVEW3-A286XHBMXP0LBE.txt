Title: Decent Machine
Content:
I bought this after much research and actually purchasing a Kenmore Progressive first then returning it. I returned the Progressive because the power paw broke the first time I used it and the machine was very flimsy. I also own a Eureka bagless upright which has had constant problems with breaking belts. The filters clog too fast and the attachment hose hase collapsed. I am very hard on my vacuums and have a german sheppard and a cat to thank for it. Now this Hoover comes with a turbo paw which is powered by suction and in my opinion is useless on any machine. If you press it too hard to any surface it stops moving. However, I already knew this because of the Eureka upright I had so thats not what I bought this unit for (if you're looking for something to clean pet hair off furniture try the dirt devil power brush bagless handheld vacuum, you won't be disapointed). I bought this vacuum because I have a lot of tile and hard wood in my house and for that its great.  The hardwood floor attachment must be used though. Don't try turning off the brushes and using the power head. Use that for carpets with the brushes turned on. The dirt cup is easy to empty and depending on how often you vacuum will determine how often you have to empty it. I vacuum once per week and have to emty it once to twice with each use. The extending pole is a little flimsy but compared to the Kenmore Progressive line this thing is a tank and costs half as much. I recomend this product to anyone looking for a decent vacuum.

Title: Terrible coffee maker
Content:
This is my second Krups and my last. I've had it 4 months and the water brew temperature is about 160 degrees, which makes a lousy cup of coffee. I use only filtered or distilled water so there shouldn't be any  build-up on the heating elements, but I decalcified it anyway and still can't raise the temp. I give it one star because it fits under my cabinets, otherwise it's a piece of junk. And a guy can't get his hand in the carafe to clean it.

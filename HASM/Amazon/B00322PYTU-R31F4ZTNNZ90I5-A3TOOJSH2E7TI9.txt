Title: Nice laptop computer, but...
Content:
Positives:  Great features for the price, Intel i3 processor, blue ray player , 500gb, windows 7.  Negatives:  Glossy exterior smudges easily with fingerprints and marks clearly visible, requires several wipedowns.  No light up keyboard, plastic exterior feels fragile and flimsy.  It's no Apple Macbook Pro, but good laptop in the PC universe.

Title: Awesome!!
Content:
I've had this for a few days now and its awesome. The only bad thing is the headphones. I could care less if it has no screen most of the time you dont look at it anyways. Itunes is super easy to use and the size is perfect. 512mb is better then 1gb. Get 512mb and nice headphones and its perfect! That's about it easy to use except turning it on. The slider on the back is slippery.

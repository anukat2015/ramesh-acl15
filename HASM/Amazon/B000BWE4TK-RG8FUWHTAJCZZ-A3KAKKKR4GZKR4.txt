Title: I'm converted!
Content:
I'm a die-hard film retrograde. Yet I've tried (and owned) dozens of digital cameras, starting with Apple Quicktake in 1997 - dissapoinment after dissapointment. D50 takes fabulous pictures and is cheap enough to own. Works with my old Nikon lenses and even an SB-28 flash (in M mode).

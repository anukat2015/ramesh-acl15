Title: Disappointing
Content:
Bought this item because of its looks and because I thought it would be handy to use while flying and being able to watch my DVDs. Also bought the DVR station.  When trying to copy a DVD using the s-video connection, encountered a problem, and called tech support.  Waited on hold for 29 minutes, after which I was told that I needed to remove the s-video and connect using the RCA connectors.  Did so, but could not copy.  Connected the unit to my Motorola cable box using the s-video connection, and was able to copy a tv program, but no audio.  Absolutely frustrating.  The unit by itself is very nice, very portable, and the videos included and the music are fine, but the sound through the built-in speaker is poor.
Prior to this experience, I was having problems connecting to my WiFi connection at home and called tech support.  Waited 11 minutes, and was told by the technician that the device "did not support home-based Wi-Fi."  I reset the unit, re-checked the WEP numbers, and it connected.  This tells me that the tech support is poor.  The manual, all 59 pages of it, has to be copied from the Archos site.  There is an additional manual for WiFi.  Not very clear, does not tell you how to conect the various devices you might want to connect, such as a DVD player, cable box, or TV.  It does not tell you, for example, that you have to disconnect the out cables from your DVD player in order to connect the Archos.  A very attractive unit, very well made, great screen, but the support and the manual are below par.  I finally returned the unit and the DVR station to Amazon, and am now looking for a better unit.

Title: 1500-Watt Quartz Power Radiant Heater
Content:
I have 2 of these heaters and they are excellent! We purchased the first one's 2 years ago and ordered from the company new bulbs and had work done on them FREE of charge.
They have helped our utility bill as here in the Midwest, electricity is cheaper than natural gas in the winter months.
They are warm and QUIET, which is one of the reasons we like them better than other brands we have checked out.
The Marvin Company has been wonderful to work with and always replaced
our heaters when we needed repairs, and in a very short time.

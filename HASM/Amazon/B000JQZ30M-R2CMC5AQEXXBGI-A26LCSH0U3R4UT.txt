Title: Works great
Content:
I got this yesterday and put it in the basement. It heated the whole basement -- not just one small area. I was thinking I would need two in order to keep the basement warm in the winters so I thought I would buy one for now and see how it worked. I'm so glad I only bought one! It's all I need! Highly recommended.

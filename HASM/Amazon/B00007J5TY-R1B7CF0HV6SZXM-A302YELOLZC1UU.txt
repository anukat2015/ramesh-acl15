Title: Bosch????
Content:
This brush did not ship directly from Amazon, but from GoVacuum. Nowhere on the brush is the name Bosch, and though it was supposed to be for my Bosch model, the Compact Plus Health Guard, I suspect it was not even made by Bosch. It is MUCH darker in color than pictured and MUCH darker than my other attachments. The clip by the connection end which is supposed to be used to clip on to the canister is much more difficult to use than the one on the original brush and even when it engages, the wand isn't steady. The vacuum does work though, with the brush attached and that is the most important feature.

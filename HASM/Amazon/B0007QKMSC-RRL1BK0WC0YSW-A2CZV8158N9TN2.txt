Title: Maybe I got a lemon
Content:
Maybe I got a lemon. I bought this camera based on the previous reviews. I was so dissapointed with the very first shots I took. I was expecting sharp clear pictures and all I got were slightly fuzzy ones. This camera was supposed to be an upgrade from my Kodak 740 5mp. My Kodak takes amazing pictures! You can see every hair and every eyelash on my grandsons with the Kodak 740 and I was expecting to be blown away by the picture quality of the Canon by moving up from a 5mp to an 8mp. I tried different settings manual and auto but my old Kodak 740 takes much better pictures. I'm sending this back to Amazon and upgrading to the Kodak 8.2mp Easyshare. Hopefully the new Easyshare will fix the complaints I had with the 740 - the lag time between pictures and with image stabilization I can't wait to see what kind of pictures I can get with it.

Title: Great product
Content:
I bought one of these for the house because I had one at work and it is great to have.  It is really nice trying all the different flavors of coffee and what not.  It is simple to use and easy to clean.  It is also very fast.  You have your coffee ready in less than a minute.  
I have very few gripes.  One is cost.  Its not too bad but its not cheap either.  The other is that it creates a lot of waste.  You are tossing little plastic K-cups after every use.  That makes the little "My K-cups" that much more attractive.

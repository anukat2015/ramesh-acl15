Content:
Have owned this unit for several months now and have found nothing to complain about. The varible suction feature is something I have found very useful as full suction has a sufficient suction to suck up throw rugs and small animals. The bagless canister and filter are easy to clean with minimal effort. Love the no bag concept, as I can never remember the proper bag type to get when I am at the store. The unit's large wheels make for easy movement and the unit is light enough that I can pick it up and carry it around as I vacuum. The little power head for cleaning furniture is also quite handy and saves me the trouble of trying to clean the cat hair off of the furniture with the regular power head. All in all I am very pleased with the performance of this unit and have no reservations in giving it a five star recommendation.

Title: Great Machine but Short Life
Content:
I have had two of these machines.  It does a great job except for two major problems.  First, if you fill it up to the 32 oz mark it overflows all over the counter which is a hugh pain.  Second, the heating element has a very short life.  I returned the first machine to the manufacturer in Utah....they were very accommodating and sent me a new one.  However, I'm now experiencing the same problem.....no heat.  I also agree with one of the reviewers that it is extremely hard to clean.  I have used everything under the sun to clean the milk scum (and have actually wondered if that has contributed to killing the heating element, but probably not).  I'm now in the process of looking for another machine, but am at a loss on which one to buy.  There don't seem to be many choices (in a reasonable price range) out there.  I tried to buy the one by Mr. Coffee but it's out of stock everywhere.  I'm also surprised that other reviewers haven't had the heating element problem that I've had.

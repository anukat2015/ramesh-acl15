Title: Best Coffee Maker for Under $100!
Content:
Mine was white instead of black but I owned it for years without any problems and it was destroyed by a house fire...wish I could find another one just like it in white.  It's perfect for anyone that likes to keep coffee hot for hours without needing to reheat or warm up...mine kept the coffee hot for several hours...it would still be warm at the end of the day without losing flavor or degrading.

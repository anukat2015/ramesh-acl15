Title: Waste of time and money.  Buyer beware
Content:
I received this product today and tried all afternoon to get coffee out of it.  All I wound up with was hot brown liquid that tasted like plastic. What a disappointment.  I also bought the Presto My Pod device for using ground coffee in the thing.  Another waste of money. Since both the companies I bought these items from basically have a no return policy, don't answer phone calls or emails, I'm basically out $50 for nothing.  Word to the wise - read the return policy if the seller is not Amazon.  
Update 1-8-09 = Many, many attempts to contact orangeonions about this product have failed.  They don't answer phone calls or emails.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.

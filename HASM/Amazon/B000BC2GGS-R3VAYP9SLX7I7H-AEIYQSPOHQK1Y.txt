Title: quiet and effective
Content:
We got the heater for our 4 season sun porch in October.  We shut off the porch at night and in the morning switch on the heater.  In a short time the room is toasty warm and we open up the room to the rest of the house.  It is quiet and effective and fits our needs so far.

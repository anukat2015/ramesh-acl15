Title: 1 word SOUND!!! it blows the "Idontknowwhatmusicissupposetosoundlikepod" away
Content:
I'm only giving this 4 stars because i can't believe the zune creators didn' put any kind of equalizer on this thing no equalizer at all huh. but i must say it sounds freaking awesome even without an eq. let me start off by saying i have used the new classic ipod and i can't believe for such a popular and expensive item they sound the way they do my musicjust did not sound the same on an ipod. well i bought this yesterday and OH MY GOD this thing sounds incredible i challenge anyone who has an ipod to go and buy one of these and listen to the sound and tell me your ipod can even compare. and if you don't like it just return it. but anyone who has been using an ipod for years don't know what there missing. this thing is awesome for sound alone but all the other new features are killer to. hopefully the eq will be addressed in a firmware update. go out and get one you will love it uhhhhh what music should sound like!

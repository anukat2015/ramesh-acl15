Title: Only Worked for 6 Months!!!
Content:
I loved the idea of the on-Demand feature.  Unfortunately, the switch went out after about 6 months of use.  (6-8 cups of coffee per day)  The other scary thing is that the coffeemaker would turn on, but the water wouldn't pump.  That allowed the heating element to turn on and heat up an empty plastic holding tank.  I'm amazed that I never had a fire or plastic melt-down.  
My friend has the DCC-1200 and her switch went out after less than 1 year!Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless Steel  Cuisinart has some issues!!!

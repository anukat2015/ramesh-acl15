Title: Overall Good Priced Player
Content:
First few days owning this and i have to say i am really impressed with its performance. Sound Quality is simply superior, nicely done. major ups on this product is the "folder" option, where you can find songs a lot easier...for example you have 2 folders one for rock one for pop, you can switch folders to listen to the music specifically in that folder or you can switch it to shuffle mode where it will play every song (shuffled). some major downs about this product that i notice is that it doesn't have a hold/lock button, and sometimes while i listen to my music it switches, buttons are very easily pressed but are solid enough to a point where accidents like pushing the forward button can be avoided. another thing is you have to charge directly from the computer, which i find annoying and the USB plug to the computer is extremely small, good for those people who have their whole computer next to them. the plastic cover can pick up fingerprints easily if you have the black one. but nonetheless, this is an overall good player, i would recommend it to others...its only 40 dollars, quality already satisfies me, this mp3 is definitely worth your money

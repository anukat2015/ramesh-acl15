Title: product ok
Content:
After, what I thought, was a lot of research I decided on the cuisinart two go coffeemaker. It does what it says it does with the exception of the mugs. When the coffee first drips into the mugs they are almost to hot to handle and they are the only mugs that fit under the spouts. I was very disappointed to find this out. But I suppose what do you want for so little money. Just make sure that you don't break them or lose them.

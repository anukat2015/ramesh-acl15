Title: Worst design.. What were they thinking
Content:
I have waisted my money on two of Cuisinarts machines. The first one lasted a year and a day! Even before the year was up the carafe leaked. This one didn't even last that long.  What were they thinking when they put the grinder over where the steam comes up!!?? By the time you coffee is finished you have a gross mess on your hands and it takes more time to clean it out after each use then it does to get ready for work.  I started using my other grinder and turning the grinder off.. Then while brewing, the grinder would come on for no reason, then you could not get it to turn off.. 
I went out and got a Ham-Beach Brew Station... OH MY The first one I got was broke, the second one I got the coffee tasted like plastic, nothing i could do to get that taste out of it.. (so much for all the high rated machines) I decided on the Krups and it has been a few months now and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!! (was rated lower and that is one of the reasons i got it) So much for "ratings" LOL 
I would not get this Machine EVER AGAIN or any Cuisinarts for that matter!

Title: Great heater, Awesome price!
Content:
This heater rocks! This little heater gives great heat, and it is very quiet! I researched many many heaters, i have bought as many if not more. This is a great companion to the Holmes Quartz heater, which is THE BEST HEATER KNOWN TO MAN. Just add a small fan, pointing at the Quartz Heater, and bam, my whole house is warm. I use the small heater pictured here, to warm the little rooms.

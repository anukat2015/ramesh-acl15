Title: SU2300 versus SU3500
Content:
I own both this laptop with the dual core SU2300 and the model with the single core SU3500.  The SU2300 feels quicker and has a lower cpu utilization for a given activity than the single core SU3500, but my initial observation is that the battery life may be less (~10%)for the SU2300 laptop.  I'm curious to see what results the formal review sites get.

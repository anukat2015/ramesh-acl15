Title: Great, but not spectacular.
Content:
I'll make this short, since there are so many other reviews which are quite detailed. 
Having upgraded from the previous MacBook Pro model, some 2 years old, I was looking forward to the new model. I can safely say everything is improved greatly with one glaring exception. The "chicklet" style keyboard. To be frank, it stinks. I don't really understand why Apple, remarkable for design and quality would make a change to something like the KB. The previous version had a great look and feel. This one looks cheap, and feels lousy. 
Baring my disappointment with the KB, there's much to love about this notebook.

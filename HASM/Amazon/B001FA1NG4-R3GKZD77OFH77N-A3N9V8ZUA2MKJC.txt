Title: Ipod Nano
Content:
I bought myself an Ipod Nano and I found it very easy to do everything from chargeing the ipod. The only thing I found a little hard was to down load music but once I figured it out, I now enjoy downloading any kinds of music.
  So if you are looking for your first Ipod I would go with the Nano kind.

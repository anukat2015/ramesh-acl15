Title: Big Buddy
Content:
Great little heater! This thing puts out a lot of heat. I bought it for a backup when the power goes out but I've been using it a lot just to knock the chill off. I keep the heat pump set pretty low which is fine when I'm up moving about but when I sit down to read or watch tv it is a little cool. I fire this thing up for a little while to warm the room and I don't have to turn the heat pump up and heat up the whole house. I also bought one for my cabin.

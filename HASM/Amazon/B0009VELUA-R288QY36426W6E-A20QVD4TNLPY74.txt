Title: at long last
Content:
I was starting to think it was me, I just was never satisfied.  We  have bought countless coffee makers and finally we are thrilled.  I actually had less hope for this one than most because it looks so great and it's so novel but low and behold,  it's great.  The coffee is really good and continues to taste fresh and hot for hours.  While pouring the water in a pre-caffeinated state can be a challenge just get a cheap plastic funnel, believe it's a small price to pay.

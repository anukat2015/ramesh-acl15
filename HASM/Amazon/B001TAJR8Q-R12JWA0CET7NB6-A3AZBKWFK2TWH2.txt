Title: THIS SUCKS!  It's a piece of JUNK!
Content:
I purchased this just last week.  It IS NOT compatible with itunes FYI....there is a feature to "format" on the menu...DO NOT DO THIS.  I just called customer service at COBY (not Amazon) and they simply stated "well you just ruined your unit."  WTF?  Why is it a feature???  I am not as "tech savvy" as some and did NOT realize this was not compatible with a MAC or itunes.  I was trying to figure out why it was not reading the music I downloaded.  Unbelievable.  Will NEVER buy from that company again!

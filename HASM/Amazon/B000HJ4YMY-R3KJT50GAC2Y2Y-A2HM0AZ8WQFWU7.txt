Title: Excellent camera for the intermediary and advanced photographer but not optimal for beginner or pro
Content:
This camera has just about every feature that the intermediate and advanced photographer would want. And nearly all work very well at an extremely high level of quality (i.e., color rendition is excellent, it permits relatively quick sequential shooting for a digital camera, etc.) Hence it would be perfect for them. But for a novide it would be overkill and too expensive. For these photographers the D40 would be a better choice. For the professional a more durable camera with a few more features such as the D200 would suffice. Hence the camera is great for the intermediate to advanced level market. 
The camera itself is not only heavily loaded with features but it is relatively ergonomic, has a fairly decent battery lifespan and, with the 18mm-200mm lens can do everything that required a large set of lenses (and the accompanying bag) that were needed in the past world of film cameras. Hence it is perfect for trips. One does not need to lug around 100 lbs. of equipment.

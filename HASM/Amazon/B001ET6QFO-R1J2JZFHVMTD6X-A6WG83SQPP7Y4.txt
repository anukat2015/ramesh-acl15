Title: Great Camera, However....
Content:
I bought this camera about six months ago. Love it to pieces.
Last month however, Canon Released the: Digital Rebel T1i 
for $300 less and here's the kicker: THERE IS LITTLE TO NO DIFFERENCE
IN PICTURE QUALITY BETWEEN BOTH CAMERAS.  
Check dpreview for a detailed description of both cameras.  The sensor
used in this camera is the same one they placed in the T1i.  
So then why would you buy this camera instead? I can only think of two:
a more solid body frame (doesn't feel like plastic), and ... the name (50D). As a photographer to certain people, the type of equipment you use, and the stigma behind it counts more than the actual pictures.
If you don't really care about either one of the two reasons above, save yourself the $300 and buy a T1i.

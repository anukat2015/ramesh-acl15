Title: Returned, but Great Customer Service
Content:
When this was shipped to me I was given the 4th generation iPod instead of the third generation that I ordered and wanted. I had no problems getting in contact with someone and all of my emails were replyed to immediately. I decided to just return the iPod and get a refund. They paid for return shipping and once the information was recieved they promptly returned my money.

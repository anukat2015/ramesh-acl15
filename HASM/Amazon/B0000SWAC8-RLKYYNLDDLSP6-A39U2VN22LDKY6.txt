Title: Really Nice Vacuum
Content:
I bought this vaccum after developing allergies for the first time.  My parents have had an elextrolux for the past 25 years and it has always worked great.  Although Eureka is now making these electrolux vaccums I expect that in order to preserve the integrity of the name they will make every effort to make sure this product line is up to standard, and I think they have succeded in this regard.     Contrary to the other reviews I took my vaccum home and was able to connect all of the pieces by myself without any problems.  The bags are small, but so is the vaccum.  If you want bigger bags chose an upright, but beware, the hepa filtration on those units is not as good.  The filter and bags are easy to acess.  The power head is very sturdy but has a little trouble standing on its own- it can do it, but  will fall down with the slightest breeze.       The vaccum is very quiet.  To test the suction I first vaccumed with my old vaccum and then revaccumed with this one.  I was very impressed.  I could hear every piece of sand and crumb climbing up the hose- and there was a lot!!!  It even has a light so you can vaccum in the dark, or in a dark corner. The head seems to move itself effortlessly across the room.      If you are considering this machine, don't be afraid of the other reviews.  I did not experience their woes.

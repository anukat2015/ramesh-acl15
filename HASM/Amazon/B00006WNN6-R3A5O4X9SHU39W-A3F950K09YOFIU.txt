Title: Excellent heater, until it turns itself off
Content:
The heater does its job well. We've been transferring it from room to room, and it is complementary to our central heating.
Unfortunately, it has a tendency to shut itself off, especially when used in small spaces (like the bathroom or the kitchen). We assume it's some sort of protection from overheating mechanism, but it's still quite annoying, and limits our use to large rooms.

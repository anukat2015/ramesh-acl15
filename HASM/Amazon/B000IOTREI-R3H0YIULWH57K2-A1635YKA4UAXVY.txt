Title: good product, except for "don't sue us" footlight
Content:
We got this at Costco for $60, which compared to less efficient heaters is pricey.  It works as described.  In regard to the much hated footlight, this would be a useful feature if the footlight came on when the heater was on and went off when the heater control was turned to the off position.  We've accidentally left the heater on Low when no one was around, since the glow is not always detectable at Low.  However, the light stays on as long as the heater is plugged in.  So, I just removed  the light bulb as apparently most people do.

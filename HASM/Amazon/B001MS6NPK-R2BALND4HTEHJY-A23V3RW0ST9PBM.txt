Title: Horrible Experience with Sony VAIO
Content:
After receiving the product less than a week, I couldn't turn the computer on successfully. The black/blank monitor just keeps showing even restarting it for a hundred times. Jesus!! I was very pissed and wanted to throw it away. Then, I decided to call its customer service and received very good assistance. He analyzed that the problem occurred from "Windows malfunction"?!!! How could that ever happen for a brand new computer with 6 days of usage. Anyway, I had to reinstall it to the factory setting for about 2 hours. Plus, all data has been lost for good.
It's been a bad half-day morning without any productive work as I was being stuck with the stupid thing like this. 
Oh well, it's my first time with Sony laptop and surely will be my last. 
BTW, I also purchased Dell XPS M1330 prior to this like a month ago for my sister. It's been working very nicely. Love it!!

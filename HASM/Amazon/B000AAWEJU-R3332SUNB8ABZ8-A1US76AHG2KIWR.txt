Title: Pricey but excellent performance
Content:
I replaced an older upright vacuum with the Miele.  The first thing I noticed is the power brush picking up almost all the loose hairs on the ground during the first pass-through on the carpet.  This vacuum is very quiet compared to others, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not sucking dirt vigorously.  Only negatives are a relatively short cord and need to manually clean the turbo brush by cutting the trapped hairs and pulling out the dustballs.

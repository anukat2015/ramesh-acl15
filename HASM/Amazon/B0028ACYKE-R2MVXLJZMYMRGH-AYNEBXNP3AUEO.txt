Title: Super Thin....
Content:
Length:: 3:17 MinsI have the x320 model, at first I thought it would be slow, I was wrong. This machine is so thin and light but is fast too. I do multitasking just as I do on my pc. This laptop is going to be very useful for college this year. The only con I can think of is the keyboard can be a bit better, But i think its sturdy enough. This model doesn't come with the mouse or carry bag, you can buy the carry bag at [...] seems like the only place that carry's them. 
BTW, the MSI logo on the machine lights up when computer is in use, looks pretty cool.
Review of the carry bag, its a must! It's really nice, it has a magnetic clip and looks very professional made out of pleather? It also is protected on all sides.

Title: UnClogging and Cleaning the Vacuum more than Vacuuming
Content:
At first we had thought we got a deal and didn't have to spend the money on the dyson.  Well after a few months the problems began.  The vacuum would get clogged and need cleaning at least every other or so use.  Then the filters would also need cleaning which is incredibly messy.  With two newfoundlands this vacuum just didn't do it.  We finally gave in and bought the dyson.  Just to test I first vacuumed with the bissel, then I tried the Dyson.  Gross... the dyson picked up a ton of stuff that the Bissel "pet hair eraser" missed and I mean a lot.  
The actual pet hair eraser atttachment also only worked maybe the first 4-5 it was used and is now useless, as I have given up on taking it apart again and again.  The lift off part is not a bad idea, but the hose and cord are so short it's pointless to clean anything but a car.
All in all, I wish I would have bought the Dyson in the first place, and not wasted my money on something that only works for a few months before having major problems.

Title: Great product for Price
Content:
I picked this laptop over others because of the bang for my buck. But it is far from the best. It comes with (like every other laptop on the market) a bunch of preloaded software and trial versions. I spent two days uninstalling half of this crap. What really made me mad is that Acer has partnered up with google to help google's launch of "igoogle". It is impossible to go to the regular google website. Everytime you to www.google.com it will automatically direct you to the Acer/Google igoogle account. There was no way to change this other than to install another web browser, which I did. The laptop is fast, it already has 3 gigs of RAM meaning it can only take one more gig before being maxed out on a 32 bit operating system. The hard drive is already partition (for your convenience) which also made me upset since I like to partition the HDD myself. But for what you pay you get the most powerful laptop out there, trust me I looked everywhere. And don't buy a compact, their total garbage.

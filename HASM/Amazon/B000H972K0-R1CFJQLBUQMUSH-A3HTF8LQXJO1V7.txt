Title: Can't handle the load
Content:
I'm an air conditioning contractor and purchased this item to cool my insulated garage.  When I finally got it together and turned it on, the compressor didn't come on for a few minutes.  When it did, it cooled like it should.  But after about 5 minutes the compressor turned off. Probably on high pressure.  It was only 88 in the garage.  This thing should be able to handle that load.  The controls are easy to figure out but the air outlet only adjusts left or right. You can't change the discharge direction up or down.  So the cool air (when the compressor is running) hits me in the thighs, I would rather like to be able to direct the air discharge up and across the area for better circulation.  Overall, this is a big disappoinment.  This item maybe useful as a supplemental A/C, like in a room that doesn't cool well.  But don't depend on it to cool a room by itself.  It won't be able to handle the load.

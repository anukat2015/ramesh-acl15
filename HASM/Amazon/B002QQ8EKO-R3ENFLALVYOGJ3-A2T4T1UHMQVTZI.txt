Title: Great Machine
Content:
Love the computer, out of the box does everything you'd expect from a Mac. I've been a PC users for 20 years and the conversion was simple except for one noteworthy issue, the iTunes library transfer to the new machine is a horrendous pain in the butt. I also miss Live Writer for Windows.. I'm a big blogger and Apple has not provided anywhere near the tools that Microsoft has offered with publish from word (which the Mac version doesn't have) and Windows Live Writer. 
One buyer beware, if you buy the computer from Amazon, the Apple Store will not support the item. ie. you can't even buy one to one.. Still, by the time you tack on the Apple Store charges it's $150 less on Amazon so, you'll have to judge on worth. Apple Care BTW, $50.00 cheaper here.

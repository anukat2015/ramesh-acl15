Title: Leaked Oil After 3 Months
Content:
This heater worked quite well for 3 months.  Than it began leaking oil.  DeLonghi instructed us to take it to a repair center a half an hour away.  The repair center was not helpful and DeLonghi customer service was quite rude.  At this point I am giving up on the notion that they will fix or replace this unit and will buy a new space heater.  I will not purchase this brand again.

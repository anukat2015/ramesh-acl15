Title: wonderful coffee and looks nice on my counter
Content:
I bought this coffeemaker to replace another Capresso coffeemaker that I have used almost daily for over 8 years. It is still going strong and still makes great coffee, but my kitchen is all stainless steel and I decided to treat myself to an upgraded look. This pot is really beautiful and has a few improvements in design - the plastic coffee filter holder is sturdier, and the all steel construction is even better at keeping the coffee hot for hours. Plus, it looks expensive and I found the price at Amazon to be really great. (Added comment several months later - I used the my old Capresso coffeemaker last month when I had Christmas dinner and needed a second coffee pot to make enough coffee. To my surprise the old Capresso made much better coffee - richer taste and used much less coffee. My guess is that the new Capresso is much faster so the water goes through the coffee grinds faster and therefore some of the richness is lost.)

Title: WARM!
Content:
Unlike other reviewers, I live in a subarctic climate and my apartment is not properly insulated.  Which means that with our furnace constantly running it doesn't get any warmer than 65.  We got this little heater for our living room and it does get the room 10 degrees warmer.  As far as noise level, I can't hear it over our furnace.  It arrived promptly and safely from Amazon.

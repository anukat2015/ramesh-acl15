Title: Effective, but BRIGHT
Content:
There are many reviews that rave about this heater---and they're true.  For the low power use, it does an excellent job of heating the area it's facing, and the oscillating feature is nice, but---it is EXTREMELY bright.  Cannot overstate that.  It could be the primary light for a medium sized room, and it is rather distracting.  So distracting that I can't even use the high setting.  If you can make the light work for you, it can serve two purposes--great.  But you should know it's as much a light as it is a heater.

Title: So far so good!
Content:
We decided that because of the high cost of heating that they are predicting for this winter that we would purchase a couple space heaters.  I just purchased this a couple days ago at a local store, which happened to be more expensive than Amazon's price.  We've set up the space heater in our Family Room and are quite happy with the warmth it has provided so far.  It is also very quiet and doesn't look odd or out of place in our decor.  It's light and very easy to move.  The safety features are great.....once it tips even a little it stops.  I'm sure that this must be a requirement for other heaters but we were happy with this feature as the kids are always running around and knocking things down.  We'd hate to have it start a fire.  I'm thinking about purchasing another heater for upstairs and will update this review if I have any negative feedback.

Title: Amazing!!
Content:
I just bought this so I wouldn't have to lug my big vaccum around to clean the furniture. Never expected it to work so great.  I have two dogs and two cats and a canvas couch.  Normally it takes 30min to and hour to get all the hair off my couch, in 10 min I was done.  You only need to take one or maybe two passes instead of the normal 5-6 or more with all three of my past vacuums.  The attachment with the brush pivots and it really whips that hair right up, it's amazing.  This is the only cleaning product that I've ever been so impressed with to write a review.  You can't beat the price either.

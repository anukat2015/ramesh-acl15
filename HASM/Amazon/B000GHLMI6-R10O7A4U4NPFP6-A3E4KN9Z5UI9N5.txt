Title: very happy, much better than some more expensive options
Content:
have had literally a dozen or so coffee makers and this is the first one I've kept for over a year and still been pleased.
It is very easy to clean and makes coffee fairly quickly. The parts assemble and disassemble quickly and easily. Pouring the water into the brewing basin is a breeze and even though I'm sort of a klutz, I rarely make a mess or spill anything. So far the whole thing has been very sturdy with nothing broken or loose. And, the dispenser is easy to use and accepts even very tall mugs.
Areas for improvement. Because the heating element is post-brewing, you have to give the coffee a few minutes to warm up after it brews. (I start with hot water to remedy this.) The carafe is not insulated in anyway, so the only way the coffee stays heated is by the small metal heating element in the carafe. It is sufficiently hot, but it also means the coffee will begin to taste slightly burnt after a few hours. Also, the heating element turns off after two hours. This is good, but since I sip on coffee most of the morning I wish that I could extend this without simply turning the "brew" button on again. Again, having an insulated basin would be better overall.

Title: Hoover WindTunnel S3765-040 - AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Content:
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GARBAGE OR ANY HOOVER. Hoover was once the premiere vacuum company on the market but was bought over a few years ago and now makes garbage products with terrible customer support that refuse to stand behind their products. I purchased this windtunnel about 14 months ago (warranty is only 1 year). It operated smoothly for the first 5 months at which point it started to crumble. First the power nozzle would randomly shut off. I was able to locate the problem as a defective power nozzle cord but rather than fix it myself I brought it to a hoover service center since it was under warranty. The unit sat at the service center for 4-5 weeks because hoover took their time processing the warranty and sending the part. Since that point in time, various other parts started to break and the unit is covered with duct tape just to hold it together. Recently, a small piece broke on the telescoping wand and the entire wand needs to be replaced (about $70). Now that it is no longer under warranty I called Hoover to voice my complaint and the customer service supervisor told me "sorry, its beyond the warranty date". I told her of my history with this garbage and she maintained "sorry, its beyond warranty". I asked: "does this mean you will not stand behind your product" and her response was "we do, for a year". I will go back to Eureka, my last vacuum was a Eureka which lasted 6 years. I thought I was upgrading my getting a hoover - big mistake.

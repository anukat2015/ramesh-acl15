Title: Great for work and games
Content:
I bought the computer mainly for games.  However, the wide screen is especially useful for work.  I can keep a number of submenus on the right while my document is on the left.  It is also easier to juggle two documents at once.  If you have the screen real estate, you will find a way to use it.The computer gets heavy if you leave it on your lap for 8 hour gaming sessions.  But then, its a small price to pay for the wide screen.  Saved my virtual life a few times.  I can spot the enemy coming a lot sooner with the bigger screen.The DVD drive has a 1X write speed.  I could not get the built in wireless to work with my wireless network (linksys wireless G router).  I am not the smartest wireless guy.  No problem, I just plug in a linksys PC card and everything is fine.  Life is too short to figure out these small problems when there is a workaround.There is no trackwheel (the little wheel on some mice) and I miss that.  Speakers are nice but you can't expect loud volumes from computer speakers.  There is a dial for speaker volume - nice.You can buy a 3 year warranty from Toshiba for $120.  I forgot the exact price.I love the machine.  This will be my main game engine for the next year.

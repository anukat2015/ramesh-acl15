Title: Great Vac
Content:
This is the second panasonic vacuum I purchased. The other lasted 12 years and still works.  The wheels have broken off the old one and we use it for vacuuming the cars.  It also uses the same replacement bags that the old one did.  The new one has an additional amp of power, cleans great and even has a hepa filter which keeps down the dust on the furniture.  Tools are handy. I'd say it really sucks but I wouldn't want to give anyone the wrong idea. lol. I'd recomend it to anyone that is familiar with a canister vacuum cleaner,

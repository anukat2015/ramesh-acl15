Title: Many features to offer peace of mind
Content:
We needed a supplemental electric space heater for an unheated bedroom in our home that is occasionally used by guests. I selected this model over the Honeywell HZ515 because it has a screen to display the temperature instead of just a selector dial. We own one other electric heater that has a thermostat without a display, and it is much harder on that Delonghi unit for someone to set the temperature without consulting the manual. This heater is quite straightforward to operate in comparison.
If you simply push the power button, the unit will come on at full power and keep heating at full power until you turn it off again.
If you push the power button and then use the up- and down-arrow buttons, you can select a temperature (in Fahrenheit or Celsius) that the unit will attempt to maintain (up to its 1500 W capacity) until you turn it off.
If you push power, then use the arrows to select a temperature, and then push the timer button (and use the arrows to increase/decrease the amount of time), the heater will run as much as needed to keep the heat to the pre-selected temperature for the amount of time you've selected. I believe the maximum is 10 hours--enough for overnight use.
For me, this offers some extra peace of mind. I can set this heater for a guest (or tell them how to do it) and not feel the need to check up on them in the morning to be sure the heater has been turned off.
Two other features on this heater are superior to those on my Delonghi Mica Panel heater:
* the Honeywell HZ519 has a 5 year warranty (vs. Delonghi's 1 year)
* the Honeywell HZ519 has a  three prong power cord (vs. Delonghi's 2 prong plug)

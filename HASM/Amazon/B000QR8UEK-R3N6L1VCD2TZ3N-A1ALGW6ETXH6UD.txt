Title: Nice little heater
Content:
Purchased this heater after reading other Amazon reviews. Thought it said free shipping, but had to pay extra nine dollars. Very happy with the heater. Seemed to work better after two or three times. Heats my 10 by 12 basement room very well. Have not used the thermostat - either on or off. Nice and quiet. Would buy again.

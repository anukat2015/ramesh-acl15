Title: Hoover canister vacumn
Content:
I bought a bagged canister style, Hoover S3670 Windtunnel Anniversary Edition vacumn.  I am very pleased with the performance of this vacumn.  The attachments are sturdy and the adjustable telesocpic wand is a great feature.  It does a great job vacumning over a combination of rugs and bare floors.  I have had this vacumn for 6 weeks and have no complaints yet.  Amazon ordering was easy and delivery was prompt.

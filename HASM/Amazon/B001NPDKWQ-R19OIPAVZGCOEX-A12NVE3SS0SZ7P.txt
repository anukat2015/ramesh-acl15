Title: What a horrible product - I've had TWO fail in 10 days!
Content:
Clearly HP is not the same company that they were 10 years ago and this product proves it.  It looks nice and has nice features but I have had TWO quit dead in 10 days.  Amazon is great about this and was very helpful but the product is rubbish.
To add insult to injury when I called HP support, the only recourse offered was a 5-6 week turn-around on warranty service or to send it to a repair shop at my expense (ie the warranty is not a real guarantee of relability).  HP will not stand behind their product.
DO NOT BUY this computer.

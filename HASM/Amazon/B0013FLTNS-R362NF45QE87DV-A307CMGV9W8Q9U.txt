Title: Hopefully Apple will treat me right!  1 star for now... more stars later?
Content:
I just bought a 17" Macbook Pro from a local reseller.  This is my first Apple and I am replacing a Toshiba Satellite that has done me justice for these past 7 years.   I guess I can say my first 1 HOUR experience with this Apple was not so cozy.  The screen had troubles.  The brightness basically did not come to life... it never reached a brightness that I could see the menues on the screen completely.  Tried everything, brightness control, restart, everything the manual instructed.   I called Apple tech support, and the lady on the phone simply was short and unhelpful to me and left me with a unpositive experience (mind you I was open for suggestions and help because I reallllly wanted to get this cool computer to work).  So I took it back to the reseller and hopefully they do me justice...  they need to make sure they get an "RA" number from Apple before they can do anything.  Luckily, the second Apple tech support person I called from the reseller was a little more helpful but the computer still was broken out of the box.  So, the ball is in Apple's court I guess.  I hope that Apple will do the right thing and give an "RA" to the reseller and  just replace this computer with a "new" one.  So, this review will be completed at a later date, either with a Macbook Pro in hand or another brand i.e. Toshiba.

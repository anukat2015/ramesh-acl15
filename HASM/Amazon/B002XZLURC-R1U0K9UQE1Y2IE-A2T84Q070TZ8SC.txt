Title: Perfect except for the touchpad
Content:
Very nice computer except for the touchpad. I think ASUS made a major mistake going to this touchpad design. The touchpad on my 10 inch ASUS netbook is much better. This one is much harder to control accurately and tends to make the cursor jump about or even vibrate. I love the increased power and how cool the computer runs. I guess I'll be using a mouse from now on.

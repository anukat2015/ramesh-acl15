Title: Amazon has great service!!
Content:
Ok, everyone knows that ipods are the best thing since sliced bread, so I do not need to give my feedback on the product...but here is my story.
I bought this for my Dad'd 70th bday and had it shipped to him.  When the box arrived at his doorstep...it was empty!  Now who knows how it happened??  Could have been carelessly left out at shipping, could have been stolen along the way??  Regardless, my Dad called Amazon and was put on phone w/ real person and without question, by the next day he had a ipod in his hands.  he was ssooo impressed with the service he did not care about the mishap.
Thanks you so much for being a stand-up business!

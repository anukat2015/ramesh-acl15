Title: Canon Rebel Digital SLR Provides Amazing Photos
Content:
Using the Digital SLR is having the best of both worlds. You get to set your depth of field and focus like an SLR but you know you've got your shot with the digital technology. The only thing I found in shooting primarily landscapes at this point is in autofocus mode the image seems slightly out of focus. 
The camera itself is comfortable in the hand. You can feel the quality in the placement of the controls and the ease of use. Overall it is a camera for the hobbist or pro and I love my birthday present!!!!

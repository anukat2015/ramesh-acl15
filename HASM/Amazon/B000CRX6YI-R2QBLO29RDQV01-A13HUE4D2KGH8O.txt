Title: Great camera all the way around!
Content:
This is my third Nikon digital camera. I upgraded significantly from the Nikon Coolpix 950 to the Nikon D40. Now this camera is a great upgrade.
The settings are easy to use in the menu. I love how it feels in my small hands even with the battery grip, it's so comfortable.
I've been using it since June and I will hang onto it even when I do upgrade as a backup camera.
If you have been thinking of buying the D200 or the D300, start out with this one first, it will not break your budget and you can get a better feel for the controls and how it works before jumping into the D300 or even the D3.

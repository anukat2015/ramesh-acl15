Title: keeping warm
Content:
gave it a four star rating because I'm not sure what a five should or could be!  For the price, this puppy has done what I've asked it to do.  I like it.  It's relatively simple once you've gleaned the manual.  Had the boyfriend install it; make sure you pay attention to the coloured stickers before unplugging your old therostat.  Once those are on, it's a cake walk.  Seems to be saving me money on the bill, waiting for the next one to know for sure.  But then, I don't know if I can really know.  This is the coldest and snowiest it's been in Colorado this month since the 80s! (or so they are saying.)  The boyfriend is jealous.  I bought mine because he bought one and likes it.  He thinks mine is better than his.  He got his at Home Depot for close to the same price and it's not as fancy electrically speaking.  I'm happy with my hunter fan coompany 44360 7-day energy star programmable thermostat.

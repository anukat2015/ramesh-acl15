Title: Didn't heat my room
Content:
Only heated a radius of about 4 feet around the unit, and I had purchased it for a room that is more like 10x15.  I didn't expect to be able to get the room like a sauna, but it did a pitiful job.  I went back to using a far smaller heater with a small fan that I was trying to replace.  I don't know if it was a problem with the unit, or with the settings that it had not being good enough...

Title: Makes coffee very close to starbucks quality!

AWESOME! This device brews at a very hot temperature insuring full flavor and stays hot very very well in the stainless carafe. Once we actually used the same grounds again just to see what would happen (a scientific experiment:) and it made coffee as good as Carl's jr. (not really bad at all). Recommend that the #4 filter be used and simply fold off 7/8" of the bottom tip of cone. Other devices I have found really don't deliver full flavor and you end up using way more of your coffee... which in turn can make it too bitter...I suppose if you are one of those individuals that can't stand Starbucks, complaining that it is too strong, then this one would not be for you...

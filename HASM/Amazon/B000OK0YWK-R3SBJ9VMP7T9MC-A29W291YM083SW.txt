Title: Zune blows Ipod away
Content:
Unless you are hopelessly addicted to using your opposable thumb in a circular motion, the Zune is light years ahead of the ipod.  With a larger display screen, video's and pictures are much easier to watch and since digital music is digital, the difference being in the earbuds, Zune & ipod both deliver, altho with Zune's wallpaper ability, the Zune has a nicer backdrop to your tune info.  Zune has a SUPER FM radio and wireless music xfer w/other Zune's.  The casing is scratch resistant.  MS has done it again.....

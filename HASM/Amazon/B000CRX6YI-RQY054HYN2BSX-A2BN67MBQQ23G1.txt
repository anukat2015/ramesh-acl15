Title: Incredible bargain for the price
Content:
I bought this camera in February to use as a backup to my Nikon D2X, and to use when I wanted to schlepp around a slightly smaller, less weighty camera body.  Instead, I found myself splitting my usage between the D2X and D200 almost evenly, because this camera has most of the important features of the D2X at one-third the price.  I'm not afraid of using the D200 even when image quality is paramount, because I find it difficult to detect much of a difference between the 10.2 MP files of this camera and the 12.4 MP output of my D2X.  The D200 is even quite acceptable for sports, as its autofocus is admirably fast, and its 5 fps bursts satisfactory for anything short of the D2X's 8 fps high speed crop mode.
Apparently Nikon had solved the "banding" issue by February, as I am unable to detect any banding in my D200.  Although the minority of users who experienced this issue were quite vocal, it  seems that they were, in fact, a minority.
I recommend this camera as a pro-level camera for anyone who doesn't specifically need one of the D2Xs's more advanced features.

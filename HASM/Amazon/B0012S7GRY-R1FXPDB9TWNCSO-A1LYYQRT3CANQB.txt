Title: 3rd Generation Nano Freezes often (similar to the 2nd generation)
Content:
I own a video iPod, and have owned previous generation iPods, all of which I have found to be excellent products. I just recently purchased my first Nano (the new 3rd generation) and love the looks, size, functions etc.- a potential excellent product. However, I noticed that my new Nano often completely freezes up; always after syncing; sometimes while charging; and sometimes while just changing songs, going to the menu, etc. The only way I found to unfreeze the player is to do a hard reset. This is quite an inconvenience and totally unacceptable. I thought maybe I had bought a lemon and would simply return the product for a working replacement. However, after some research, I have learned that this was and is a common problem with the 2nd generation Nano. I haven't found much information regarding this issue from others who purchased the 3rd generation - most likely because it was just released a week ago. I plan to return the product and wait until the problem has been corrected. Once this is done, I will only have wonderful things to say about the 3rd generation Nano.

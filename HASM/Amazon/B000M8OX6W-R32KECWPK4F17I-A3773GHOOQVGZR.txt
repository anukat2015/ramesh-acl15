Title: Not for me
Content:
Dont get me wrong, this is a great computer and works fine. It just isnt the right computer for me. This computer is just for casual web surfing and file transfer type things, not games or (big) downloads or anything like that. If thats all you do, the I recommend this computer for you. If you have any type of problem, customer service WILL help you, they are great and helped me the same day, within one hour.

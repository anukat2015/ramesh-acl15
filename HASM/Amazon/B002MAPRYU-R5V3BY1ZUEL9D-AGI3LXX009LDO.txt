Title: An Awesome MP3 Player
Content:
I love the Sansa Clip players. This is my 3rd one and the updates to the Sansa Clip+ are really nice. The clip in the back is sturdier (that was what broke on my last one The player still works). The mini SD port on the side will be an extra nice addition for holding more files.
Sansa Clips load with drag and drop, making it very easy to load. They also will use .mu3 playlist files.
Sansa is the one for me. Lightweight, reliable and easy to use. The sound is very good as well.

Title: Lives up to its name
Content:
We recently purchased the pet hair eraser vacuum, and it really does what it says it will do.  We have always had dogs, and dog hair is an ongoing job.  Many times vacuuming meant it looked better, but some rugs never quite got all of the hair removed.  This vacuum works even on the tough rugs (like the area rug in the living room) that pet hair seems to someone interlock into the rug fibers!!

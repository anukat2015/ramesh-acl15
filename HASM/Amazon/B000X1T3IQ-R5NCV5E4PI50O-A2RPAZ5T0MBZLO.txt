Title: Worthy successor to the E-1; a great camera
Content:
Although I have only had the E-3 for a little over a week, I find that it is an excellent camera. I am moving up from an E-1, which I have always found to be a great SLR with excellent images and color.  The E-1 is getting somewhat dated (but still takes excellent pictures) and the E-3 is the perfect upgrade -- it follows up on the durability, and ergonomic design of the E-1, but has twice the resolution, much faster and better autofocus, built-in IS (image stabilization) that works with all 4/3 lenses, and has a useful built-in flash (which I find very convenient indoors, even though I also have an Olympus FL-50 flash). This is a semipro/pro camera that a serious amateur can really enjoy and that any photographer can use.
It also has a better shutter (faster and rated for more use), better noise reduction, longer exposure time, and it kept the water resistance and dust removal filter that work very well for the E-1.
It is not cheap, but it costs less than the E-1 did four years ago and does much more. I especially appreciate the fact that I can continue to use my existing lenses, batteries, flash, charger, cables, remote control, etc. that I used with the E-1.  Everything was compatible.
In all I am very happy with the E-3.

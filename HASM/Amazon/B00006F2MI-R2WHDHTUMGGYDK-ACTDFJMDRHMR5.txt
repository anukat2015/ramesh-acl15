Title: Good coffee, bad cleanup.
Content:
There seems to be a theme in this reviews!
Yes, it is good coffee, and I love being able to set the grinding to happen the night before.  There are no heating coils for the carafe, but the coffee will stay hot enough to drink for several hours - and it'll still taste good!
But it is loud in the morning, and I can hear it all the way upstairs.  In addition, the cleaning is a pain - so much so that some mornings I choose to go out for coffee instead of having to deal with the cleanup.
Generally, I'm happy with my purchase.  My next coffee maker will be a separate maker and grinder, though.

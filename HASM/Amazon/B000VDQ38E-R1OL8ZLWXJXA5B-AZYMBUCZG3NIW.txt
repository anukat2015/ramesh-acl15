Title: Decent all around!!  Does the job when it comes to pet hair!
Content:
My only problem thus far was the belt wearing really quick.  The roller stopped spinning and there was a burnt rubber smell.  After I replaced it, it seemed to work as good as when I first bought it.  
Cleaning the container is a bit messy, but it's to be expected with a bagless.

Title: Wow!!!
Content:
Well, I am writing this review from my Gateway, and I am absolutly loving it! It came with Vista, and I have tested games on it. They run beautifully (for a laptop) and the graphics are stunning!
The only problems I see with it are:
-the speakers are bad (like most laptops)
-the keyboard has a wimpy feel (hollow almost, and the "t" key gives me problems, such as I have to hit it hard sometimes)
-the screen gets dirty VERY easily
But overall, I am VERY satisfied with this computer!

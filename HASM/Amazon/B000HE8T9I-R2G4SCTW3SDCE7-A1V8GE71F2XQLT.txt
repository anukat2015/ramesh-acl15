Title: Monster
Content:
I have had it for a year now. It really picks up dirt but is not user friendly. I have very small rooms and with this thing I have to move everything. I want something quick and easy to use. I to am very reluctant to dish out more money for a new one but I really hate this vaccum. Because believe me you will avoid vaccuming. When vaccuming carpet it is very hard to push and I have burber carpet. It has great suction but is a monster to use. I am leaning toward getting a Shark Navigator.

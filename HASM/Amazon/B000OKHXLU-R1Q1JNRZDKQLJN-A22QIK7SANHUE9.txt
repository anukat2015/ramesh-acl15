Title: Luke Cool
Content:
Think of it as a personal cooler.  Even in low humidity New Mexico this unit cannot cool any room, but right in front of the unit you'll get 3-4 degrees of relief (verified with a good thermometer) plus the benefit of blowing air, moving side to side.  The bells and whistles ("natural" and "sleep" modes) are crap, and the unit is moderately loud on the lowest speed (unbearably so at higher speeds).  Still it performs its basic function, and I wonder if any portable swamp cooler really works that well.  Limited relief at an acceptable cost.

Title: Terrific little heater that really does the job
Content:
I bought this little baby for my office, which is about 20' x 10' has large windows and is always cold. The Lasko had no problem heating the office up -- in about 5 minutes. Once at my comfortable heat level, I was able to turn it down to half power and low temp to maintain. I really like this little machine. The fan is a little loud, but its just consistent white noise, so it actually muffles sound outside my office.
I would buy it again. Great product.

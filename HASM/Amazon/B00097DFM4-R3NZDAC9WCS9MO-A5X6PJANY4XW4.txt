Title: 2 for 1 Pretty Good. Fan noise Kills 1 star, maybe a deal killer
Content:
This is not my 1st portable however this is my first combo heater and air conditioner. 
Compared to previous experience, this unit has a loud fan! 
My limited experience with the heat function has it appearing to be a mini-heat pump! It sure blew cold air out the exhaust. Bad news if you don't have it vented :-/
Max. Plate rating is 6A @ 120VAC. I while have not put a watt-meter on it, and doubt it goes beyond 5A. I think the 10,000 BTU rating is a little generous. 
As required by US Federal law, it has a GFI on the end of the cord. This can be an issue in dry climates as the ground can literally dry out!
The air filter is typical, which is to say stock cheap and cheesy. Spraying with something like endust helps.
If I could find a quieter 2 in 1, I would replace this unit. Until then, I hope it keeps functioning.
2009 update. Units of this type use a sort of an open evaporator tray, not unlike a refrigerator. Using a # of hours per day requires a drain hose (standard garden thread) to be attached at the bottom (after removing screw plug). 
Otherwise you will see a red light, and nothing else until you drain the unit. As the drain is on the bottom and rear, consider getting the unit up 1M/3Ft to get a drain going or at least a bucket.
It shut off on me in the middle of the night, during a several day cold spell, until I drained the unit.
Yes, it is still on the noisy side. Will heat/cool a room up to about 12x14 in a milder climate. I guess 10x12 in harsher weather.

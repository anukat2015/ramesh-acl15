Title: I use this as a storage device
Content:
Listen to the other reviews.  The proprietary sony format ia a pain and kills this for me.  I usually love sony stuff and the hardware may be good but the proprietary format conversion is too much for me.  I switched to a SanDisk that works well for me.

Title: Coffee Making Miracle
Content:
The Cuisinart Coffee On Demand is an absolute dream.  It brews quickly and quietly, keeps the coffee really hot for 2 hours, without that burnt taste and stays clean and drip free.  I couldn't have asked for a better product.  Best of all, you get it a cup at a time without the cost of those pod systems.  I highly recommend it!

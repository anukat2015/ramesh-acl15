Title: Great ceramic heater
Content:
The amount of heat this unit puts out is amazing.  I have used it in a garage when the outside temp was in the 20's.  Within 10 minutes, I was working in a T-shirt! Another plus is the fact that the sides, top, and bottom do not get hot.
The only negative is that the high pitched whining sound it emits makes it a little annoying for use in the bedroom.

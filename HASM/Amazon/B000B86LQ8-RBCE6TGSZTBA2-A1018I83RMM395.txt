Title: Soleus LX-120 One summer is all you get
Content:
We purchased this portable air conditioner to make it through the heat waves here in Northern California. It worked one season. It rattled toward the end of the season and got louder and louder. This season it would not even come on. My husband opened it up and the gray plastic fan inside it is destroyed. We are over the warranty period so hoping we could fix ourselves. I called customer service. You must have a certified HVAC person order the part. They will not sell parts to customers!!! Avoid this product!!! Get a window unit.

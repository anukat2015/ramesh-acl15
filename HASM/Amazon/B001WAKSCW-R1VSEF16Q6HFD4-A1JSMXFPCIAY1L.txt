Title: Finally, a "Legacy" MF lens enabler, from a great company!
Content:
I'm a 30 year former "Kodachrome", "Ektachrome" then Fuji film user, that has directed TV commercials, and done advertising/editorial photography first in San Diego, then (late 1980s- Los Angeles).  I've been enjoying HD video
30fps with a point & shoot LUMIX DMC TZ5 Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) for "behind the scenes" and "teaser" videos, and have been waiting
for the GH1 to hit the USA.
I'm amazed, and overwhelmed at the user friendly controls, screens, and have been enjoying using my many exotic Canon FD Aspherical/"L" lenses for stills, and "Feature" quality HD video/audio.
You will be hearing a great deal about this camera, and I'll be sharing my work and probably doing workshops in the future.
Congrats, Panasonic, Amazon, Pros, and all consumers, because it's affordable!

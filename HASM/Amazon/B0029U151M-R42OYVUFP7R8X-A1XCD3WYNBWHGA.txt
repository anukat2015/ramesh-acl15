Title: External TV or Monitor Connection do not work
Content:
A very disappointing issue: the Acer screen became fully distored when connect to external digital TV or extra monitor...no video output detected, nothing shown on the external devices; even with proper setting for external devices and proper cables.
Sound quality is not to par on youtube or other video playback.
It is a nice notebook if you are a light user and do not need external display devices connected.

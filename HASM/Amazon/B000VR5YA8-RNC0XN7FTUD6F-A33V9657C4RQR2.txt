Title: Nikon D300 Review
Content:
I recently upgraded from a Nikon D70s to the Nikon D300.  I was rather unprepared for how material an upgrade it was.  From its lightening fast and nearly flawless autofocus system, to the incredible fps rate, to its overall ease of use, this camera is incredible.  The controls are layed out so intelligently that it allows you to very quickly change your shooting preferences.  The only complaints, which are minor, are that the switch at the base of the camera's lens mount that controls the focus type (manual, single, continuous) is exposed and easy to inadvertantly change.  I am also a little disappointed with the onboard flash system.  However I just ordered the SB900 Speedlight which should remedy that.  Overall this camera is pro quality in every way, and the good far outweighs the minor issues.

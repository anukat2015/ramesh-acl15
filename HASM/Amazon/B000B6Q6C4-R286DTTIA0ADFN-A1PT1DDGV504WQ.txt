Title: No replacement element
Content:
This unit worked well and threw off a fair bit of heat for a couple of years of light use.  The oscillation feature works well but the unit also produces quite a bit of orange light which might be distracting depending on what you're doing in the room.  The biggest downside to this product is that there is no replacement heater element which I just found out when the unit stopped producing heat and I called customer service.  It seems a waste to manufacture something like this where such a basic part can't be replaced to extend the life of the unit.

Title: Compact, Good for one person
Content:
I need about a cup and a half of coffee to get going in the morning,
and this coffeemaker does it. The white exterior is easy to clean and
compact and neat-looking on the counter. Watch for drips, as cautioned by other reviews, I could see potential for rusting of the heating element. Great for a single person or couple who aren't massive coffee drinkers.

Title: Amazing enthusiast level camera
Content:
I've shot the D80 for over 9,000 exposures and I have grown to appreciate this as a wonderful enthusiast level camera. 
It's a 10+ mp camera with 2.5 inch screen. The controls are easy to reach and adjust. 
Given what the camera was advertised as, I am more than satisfied. Please understand that this is a DX format camera with a conversion factor of 1.5. It is NOT a full frame FX camera. I have shot in all sorts of conditions with several lenses and have had no issues at all with the camera. 
It has now been discontinued and replaced by the D90, but unless you want video try to get a D80. It's perfect for anyone who wants a DX format camera. 
My only regret is not simply going to FX (Full Frame) right from the start, but that was a decision I made and is not a relection on the camera. 
If I was in the market for a DX size camera I would certainly buy it again and I have no intention of buying another DX formatted sensor, so I will hang onto the D80 until I purchase an FX camera. Get one... you'll love it.

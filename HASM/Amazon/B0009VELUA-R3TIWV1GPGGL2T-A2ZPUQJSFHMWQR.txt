Title: Nasty tasting coffee
Content:
I bought two of coffee-on-demand brewers in order to serve coffee in my small bookstore. Like everyone in the other reviews of the DCC-2000, I loved the look of the machine, but after only a few uses of each of them, the coffee started to taste rank. I'm so surprised so many other customers got good tasting coffee out of their brewers. It seems as if old grinds get trapped somewhere and the coffee tastes burned. I even took one of the coffee makers completely apart -- screws and all -- to try to figure out where the old grinds and foul taste were coming from. I found no clues and now one of my machines is ready to be tossed in the municipal landfill.

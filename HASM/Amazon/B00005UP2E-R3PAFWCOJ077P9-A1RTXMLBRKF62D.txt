Title: Hard surface solution
Content:
I have a million vacuums-- ok, exaggeration but I own about 5 different vaccuums because I keep buying them hoping the next one will work better. This time, I did a little more research and based on the reviews, I decided to go with this one.  I checked it out at the store and was worried because it seemed a bit flimsy and light but bought it anyway since I was desperate for something to vacuum up my 1300 sq. ft. downstairs which is all hardwood and tile.  The hard floor attachment does a great job of picking up all the dust, kitty litter, and white cat hair littering my floors (my floors are dark so you can see everything). The lightweight canister on wheels follows you easily with a little tug and the stick allows you to get underneath the furniture.  The drawback to this vacuum is that the carpet attachment is useless, there's no place to store the cord (retractable would have been great) and there seems to be a little air leakage on the stick part of the vac.  Other than that, if you're looking for something to use on hard surfaces, this vacuum is a great solution.

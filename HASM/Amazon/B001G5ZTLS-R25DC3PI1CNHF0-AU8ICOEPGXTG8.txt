Title: Low Light Monster
Content:
The 5D's great strengths seem to be in it's handling of low light and it's wider frame if doing landscapes.  I've been photographing people so the wider frame wasn't as important as handling darker situations without a flash.  When people state the fps are lower they really are and the camera is extremely slower taking consecutive images than my 50D.  The 50D is the machine gun of cameras and I am happily taken with it as well.  The fact many not so great photographers in my area brag they have the 5D hasn't seem to improved their images but it is a testimony to how impressive a reputation the camer has gotten.  I'm finding the wonders of 21MP a great deal harder to throw around than my other image even on a maxed out quad core system.  Of course you can reduce this with the settings but it's hard to down grade such amazing amount of detail.  Keep up the great work Canon...and fire that guy who makes the 'icon  ( )' symbols for metering.  :)

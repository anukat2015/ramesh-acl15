Title: Compact, Effective Vaccuum
Content:
I am so pleased with the performance of this machine.  I have lived abroad, in two different global locations and accustom to having high perfaormance machines at affordable pricing.  I found shopping for that a challenge here but this panasonic model fit the bill.  It has great suction, a power nozzle that picks up and beats our wall to wall carpet, and is light weight to carry up the stairs.
One improvement I would suggest is a soft hair brush for bare floors and another attachment for fine area rugs.  I solved this problem by finding a shop that sells universal brush attachments.
At this writing, I have only had this machine for 3 weeks and my hopes are it is long lasting as I actually enjoy using it.

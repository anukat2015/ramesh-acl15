Title: Has lasted for 3 years, but I wish it would die.
Content:
Has lasted for 3 years, but I wish it would die.  Yes, it picks it all up, but like other reviews have stated, it is big, heavy, clunky, and cleaning out the canister is a mess.  The bottom intake hose gets clogged.  We've used the handle of our sons toy hammer to dislodge the debris.  It's hard to use on stairs because the hose isn't long enough and you have to balance this large beast on the step while you clean-away.  Yes, it has lasted unlike many vacuum cleaners today that break within a year.  I've never had problems with broken belts or issues with suction, so for that I am thankful.  If I could do it again, I would buy a lightweight canister vacuum cleaner with a bag (no bagless) so I don't have to revisit the dirt that I just cleaned up.

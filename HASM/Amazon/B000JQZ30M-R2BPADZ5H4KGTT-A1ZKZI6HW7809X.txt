Title: This heater is great
Content:
I have had one of these Lasko Heaters for my bedroom, but I just purchased two more.  It easy heats up my 24x24 living/dining room.  I have to leave my bedroom (12x12) door open because it gets to hot during the night, even on a medium setting.  It does have an automatic shut off if it tries to overheat which is one reason I like this model.  The only thing that I don't like is the color (gray).  I would like to see more colors available to suit everyones decor.

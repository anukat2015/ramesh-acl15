Title: Great Backup!
Content:
I purchased this vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and on my bathroom floors.  It does a wonderful job.  The pivoting floor brush makes it easy to get into corners and around tables, toilets and other areas I couldn't get to with my Dyson upright.
I have three HAIRY dogs and this vacuum picks the hair up with no problem.  It is light, sturdy, powerful, and I love that it is bagless. I have to empty the cup a few times while I am vacuuming, but that is so easy to do - no problem.
The carpet attachment is not so great, especially on the dog hair.  I still rely on my Dyson to do my carpets.  I would not purchase this machine if it was going to be my only vacuum, but it does a fantastic job for what I bought it for.
Overall, I recommend this vacuum for hard surfaces.  It's easy to carry up and down stairs and I love the way it looks, too!

Title: amazing vacuum
Content:
I bought the Miele Callisto vacuum a few days ago and I've nearly filled the bag.  The amount of suction is truly amazing. What I really love is how close the power nozzle gets to the walls and to the furniture. My carpet and the stairs have never been cleaner. The swivel on the parquet brush makes cleaning my hardwoods effortless. I always felt like I was leaving a lot behind when I used my Swiffer. I have two cats, two little boys, and two people with asthma in the family. I can't believe I've lived without a Miele for so long. It's expensive, but well worth it. Really.

Content:
I bought this heater a few weeks ago for my cubical at work.  It does a pretty good job - it warms me up when it is sitting under my desk, but if you are more than 4 feet or so from it you will not be able to feel the warm air.  Last friday I accidently left the heater turned on when I went home.  When I came to work monday, it was still working perfectly fine, no damage to it or to the building (fire is bad!).  I would buy this heater again.

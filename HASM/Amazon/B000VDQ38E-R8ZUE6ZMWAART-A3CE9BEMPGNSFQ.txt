Title: Finally a cure for Sheltie hair!
Content:
I have Shetland Sheepdogs which is another way to say hair machine.  They like to roll on the rugs so not only is there tons of hair, it is ground into the fibers.  This vacuum is incredible!  It really sucked the hair up and out performed the Dyson I am replacing.  I can't believe that this product works so well.  It is an amazing value!

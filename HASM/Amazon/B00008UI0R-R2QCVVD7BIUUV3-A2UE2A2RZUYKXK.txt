Title: great buy
Content:
I bought this vaccum to replace my dying upright. We switched to a canister vaccum because our new house has hardwood floors and area rugs and uprights aren't very good on hard surfaces. When the vaccum arrived it took literaly 4min to assemble and I used it right away. I know it might be a little lame to get excited about a vaccum but it was great! I've only used it for a week now so I can't say how it will hold up but it seems to be sturdy and durable so far (even with my 2yr old tying to ride it everytime I vaccum). 
Pros: 
-easy to manuver & pretty light weight
-self rewinding power cord
-long hose and self propelled, lighted vac head when it's on carpet mode
-the handle stands up by itself (unlike the older canister models)making it easy to store
-glides under furniture. it needs about 3in. clearance for the vac head then you can vaccum all the way under furniture without loosig contact with the floor unlike upright models
-comes with a mini vac head (with mini spinning brush)that makes it easy to clean stairs
-different suction settings and floor/carpet buttons on the handle
-can switch to floor mode when cleaning small rugs like bath mats/door mats so the brush stops spinning and won't suck the corners of the mat into the vac but you still have good suction to pick up dirt
-HEPA
-the dirt compartment has a cover so the dirt and dust won't go flying when you remove it to empty
Cons:
-it's a little too big to rest on a stair so I had to support it with my knee when I got to the middle of the staircase
-the dirt compartment fills up quickly so I find myself having to empty it half way through 
-only a 1 year warranty
All and all I think it's a great vaccum with a great price tag. The cons are pretty minor in my opinion and I would reccomend this vaccume to everyone. Did I mention it's also great on pet hair?

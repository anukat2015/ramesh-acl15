Title: Great product for the price
Content:
Great vacuum for the price.  I wanted a bagless canister vacuum with some power.  The product cleans my hardwood floors and my area rugs fine.  My husband and I love the automatic cord rewind and the extra long power cord.  Only cons are the design for the extendible wand and the motor has a "ring" when it is turned on.  The junction between the hose and handle to the wand and the base for the attachments located on the wand hinder the vacuum to maneuver in "harder-to-reach" areas.  I solve this obstacle by moving the furniture around a bit.  The ringing sound of the vacuum when the vacuum is on is a bit annoying but that might be just that particular vaccuum.  I tolerate the sound because the vacuum does such an efficient job that I am finished in hardly no time.  The price and overall quality definitely outweigh the cons for me.

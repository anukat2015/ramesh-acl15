Title: Olympus Evolt 510 a great camera
Content:
Olympus Evolt E510 10MP Digital SLR Camera with CCD Shift Image Stabilization and 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 and 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 Zuiko Lenses
Easy to use and takes great pictures and lightweigt for an SLR.  Have not used all of the features yet, but was able to take and print pictures myself with fantastic results.  You can become as "expert" as you want, or continue to use "automatic" and "scenes" with great results.  Olympus also sends "how to use" e-mails for free.

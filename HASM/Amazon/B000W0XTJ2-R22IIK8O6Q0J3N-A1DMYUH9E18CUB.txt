Title: Do not buy the jacket!!!
Content:
I bought this item on sale from staples for $999.99 plus tax after rebates.  I purchased the sleeve that is advertised with the computer from Amazon.  Guess what!! It does not fit!! The battery that sticks out of the computer does not allow the sleeve to fit. I complained to Amazon about it, but the fact that it is still on the page is appalling.  I ultimately returned the item and got credit but the whole process was a huge waste of time. Computer itself has some cool features but some of them are not worth utilizing.  The webcam's resolution is pretty bad, and the writing pad is pretty hard to use unless you press very hard.  I also bought the cooler which works marginally because while the cooling fans are in the center of the cooler, the computer's vent is in the right rear corner and is not cooled by the fans.  The computer does have a huge hard drive and 2gb memory, but the overall composition of the unit is lacking.  If it were not for the fact that my wife's work and programs were not compatible with an apple, I would have bought a macbook instead.

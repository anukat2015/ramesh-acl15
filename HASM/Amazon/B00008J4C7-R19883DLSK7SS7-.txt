Title: Avoid this at all costs
Content:
It doesn't suck! It doesn't suck! All I want is a vacuum cleaner that uses a vacuum to suck dirt up to make my place clean. Sounds simple. I took it out of the box, plugged it in, aimed it at my hardwood floor. Lots of noise, no suction. Switched attachments and headed for my carpeted stairs, same problem. Total time: 5 minutes, tops. So I packed it up in the box and went back to Target. THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT BACK SINCE I OPENED THE BOX! Duh, how do you find out a product doesn't work if you don't try it? Call a psychic?? You'll get more enjoyment if you just burn $100. I now have $100 worth of plastic in a box in my basement. And I still need a new vacuum cleaner.

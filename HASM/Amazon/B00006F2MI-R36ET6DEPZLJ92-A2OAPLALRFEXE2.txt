Title: Loud as an airplane, weak coffee
Content:
The grinder is so loud that it wakes up the entire house.  I grind beans in a separate grinder.  My neighbor also does not use the grinder on theirs anymore, as well.  Also, if I make a full pot of coffee, it is too weak to drink.  Basket should be bigger to hold more grounds.

Title: Not Electrolux Quality!
Content:
We had an Electrolux for 25 years and loved it.  Never had a problem.  Then we bought this machine and are so VERY disappointed!  We have had it to the repair shop several times to deal with suction problems.  Beware of the Power Nozzle.  The wand will guide the canister to the left but not to the right unless the user twists his/her arm awkwardly, requiring considerable patience and strength.  All members of our household dislike this machine intensely and are extremely disappointed.  We will never purchase another "Electrolux" machine.

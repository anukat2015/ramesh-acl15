Title: Miele S4210 review
Content:
The best machine for the money hands down! I am what most would consider a neat freak and this thing does the trick for me. It is very quiet when being used so the pets don't become agitated, and I can listen to music without having to crank up the volume. I enjoyed the telescoping wand feature which allows easy cleaning both high and low. I also purchased the optional HEPA filter which eliminates my allergic reaction to dust. Great product that I would recomend to anyone who has the means.

Title: best lil heater
Content:
I already had three of these and I purchased three more when they went on sale again.  These are the most efficient way to heat a small space.   I use them to create a cone of warmth when it is cool but not cold here in the mountains.  I think I can knock two months off of my woodheating season.  Two months less woodsplitting, wahoo!.
     I also use one in a bathroom to keep the pipes from freezing and they do a great job at that task.  No freeze ups last year which is a great thing.

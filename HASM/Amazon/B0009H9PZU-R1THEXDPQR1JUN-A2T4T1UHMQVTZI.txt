Title: Great product. but NO support from IRIVER
Content:
Overall a great player. The unit workes well with Windows media player 10 and is packed with features. The sound quality is excellent. Overall the player would be 5 stars EXCEPT-
IRIVER. This company has no customer service at all. I had a couple  quirky issues with the unit that I needed some help with. Their manual is useless. To-date, over the course of a week I have spent 2+ hours, per evening on 4 different days, on hold with them not able to get through. Good thing I have a speaker phone. They have yet to answer their support line.Its now become a matter of princepal that I get through. I've also sent off two different emails to them and in 5 days they have yet to return a one. Had I known, I would have seleced a different manufacturer.

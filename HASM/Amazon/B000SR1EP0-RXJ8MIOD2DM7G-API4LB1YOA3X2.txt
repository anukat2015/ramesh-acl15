Title: Shipping Damaged goods, bad customer no service
Content:
NewAir ACP-1000H Portable Air Conditioner with Heating- Up to 200 sq ft- FREE GROUND SHIPPING Other reviews noted damage product, ordered it anyway.
 Big mistake. Sure enough mine was damaged also. Called  their phone number given and after waiting on hold call was terminated directing me to use web form. Stated on form they wanted 7 days just to review claim. 15% restocking fee on cancel orders.
They also want return to be double boxed. Maybe if they would have double box it would have arrived undamaged. What a waste of time!

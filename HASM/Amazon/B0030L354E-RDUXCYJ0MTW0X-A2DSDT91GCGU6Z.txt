Title: Hp Touchsmart 300-1003 20" Desktop Pc (Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit)
Content:
Price was very competitive.
Delivery was 3 days from California to Florida.
Windows 7 was a pleasure after VISTA. It even let me decide whether to install Windows/Microsoft email, instant messenger, and browser programs or NOT. Incredible!! Bold!!
The strength of the internal WiFi adapter was OK, but not as good as my 2 year old HP laptop.
The wireless keyboard and mouse are a joy to use.
Overall, I'm really pleased!

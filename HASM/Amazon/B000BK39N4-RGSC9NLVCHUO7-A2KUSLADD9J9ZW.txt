Title: Simply Amazing!
Content:
The first camera I got had an autofocus problem, thus my bad ratings and concerns. As a result, I've purchased a Nikon D50 instead. However, everything's changed when my friend bought the E-500. Much to my surprise, the camera did focus properly and was a real pleasure to use. However, he has been a Nikon 35mm camera shooter for a long time and he accumulated quite a bit of lenses. He also loved the E-500 but realized that buying yet another set of lenses was not viable. 
So, we simply exchanged our cameras:)
The E-500 is very well built and is packed with tons of features. From dust-reduction technology to incredible colors. Yes, the Nikon D50 focuses faster and performs better in low-light and in high ISO, but once you get used to these shortcomings, you end up with an all-around camera.
I love the big LCD and all the tweaks you can do (white balance, RAW+JPG...)

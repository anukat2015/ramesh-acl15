Title: Great suction for those who hate uprights
Content:
I just received my new Hoover Commercial Portapower, and quickly put it to work on my heavily dusty rugs, hard-wood floors and furniture. I love it. I put the shoulder strap on, attach the correct attachment, and I'm off. I cleaned my whole apartment in about an hour - all with just one bag change. 
If you hate uprights, like I do, this may be the vacuum cleaner for you. It reminds me of my old Kenmore Canister that died about 5 years ago, after 20 years of great performance. I have since had two TERRIBLE uprights, that I am now ready to chuck in the trash.

Title: Apple 2 GB iPod Nano (2d gen)
Content:
I have been very pleased with the Apple iPod Nano.  The display is quite bright and easy-to-read. Navigation is logical and intuitive.  Even though I bought the 2 GB model (as opposed to the 4 GB), I am able to include 2 to 4 audiobooks, 2-3 classical music albums, and a couple of dozen photos.  Using the iPod with iTunes, on an iMac Intel, was as expected - quite easy. I did not like the ear buds that came with the iPod - hard to fit in my ears.  Instead, I use Sony over-the-ear ear buds which I find much more comfortable.

Title: Great Heater
Content:
We ordered 3 of these heaters to place in individual rooms so that we can turn down the thermostat and focus heat in selected rooms and so far everyone is happy.  My husband and I have them placed on the floors in two rooms that lack carpet and these keep our feet very toasty.  I have also placed it across the room and it does a good job heating the room quickly.  We have only had these a few weeks so I cannot comment on durability but so far we are very satisfied.

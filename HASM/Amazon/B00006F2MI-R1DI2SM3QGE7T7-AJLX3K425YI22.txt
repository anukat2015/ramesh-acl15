Title: Great All-in-One Coffee Grinder, Brewer and Storer
Content:
We had a Cuisinart combo grider, brewer and storer  for  some six years prior to purchasing  this new one. The weak point in the system is the basket that holds the ground  beans or pre-ground coffee.  The drawer system on the old unit broke  and  would  not stay closed,  thus  making the  whole  system  useless.  Cuisinart  should work on strengthing  the  drawer mechanisms so  that  this does  not happen.  The  new  unit  is  identical  to  the  old  one  (NOTE: Everything  else  on  this  system  is  wonderful  and  thus  justified  buying  a  second  identical  one)  so  we  are  entirely  pleased  with  the  new unit.  We'll  just  have  to  be  more  careful  with  that  fragile  drawer!

Title: Nice computer but frustrating glitches
Content:
This is a sleek, slim nice looking computer. But using the touchpad is extremely frustrating. The cursor moves from the last place you put it, so you're unable to reclick on the same thing. Also, a lot of times when I click on the touchpad, strange drop-down menus pop up for no reason. Nice computer for sure, but it definitely has its quirks. I don't know if I would buy it again.

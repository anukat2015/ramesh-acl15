Title: What's burning?
Content:
I bought this last winter.  It worked well for a month or so.  Then it started shorting out and stopped working.  But we discovered a reset button in the back that seemed to fix it, at least temporarily.  Next problem, it started to spark and smoke came out of it, accompanied with a sharp stench of burning solder.  Again, it stopped working.  Again, the reset button seemed to fix it so it stopped smoking.  Made us a nervous wreck.  This happened several times.  We finally threw it away.  Got almost one winter of use out of it.  I'm not buying another one.

Title: Great value if you know what you're getting.
Content:
Strengths: 4 gigs of ram, 500 gig hard drive, vista 64 bit, large monitor for a low cost. This does what I need it to (word processing, excel, email, internet, music and occasional video.  HDMI link is a plus.  Touchpad operates better than most I've used.
Weaknesses: I'm being very picky here, because I would have wanted to know this stuff prior to buying this computer.  The speakers are not designed for music.  The keyboard takes some time to get used to.  You'll need to be a bit more forceful in your typing but you can adjust.  The hot buttons on the sides of the keyboard are inconvenient because you'll touch them without realizing it and something will open up.  The headphone and microphone jacks are in the front which is inconvenient when the laptop is on your lap.  But it does have two headphone connections which is cool when I'm listening to music with my girlfriend.

Title: Does what it should
Content:
I was concerned because of some of the older reviews about build quality and other issues with this heater, but I decided to try it anyway. With LNG prices set to rise anywhere from 25% to 35% this winter, this heater is a smart investment.
We live in an old (1898) condo with single-pane glass, 11' ceilings, and no insulation in the exterior walls. This little heater does a very good job at actually heating a room. My wife no longer has to hover over a space heater, this thing actually brings the whole room up to temperature.
It did buzz a little initially when I first plugged it in. It sounded like bearing noise. I think part of the problem was that it was shipped just in its retail box which has zero packing material. After a few days of running the buzz has disappeared, and the unit is quieter than our central heat coming out of a register.

Title: Great Simplicity
Content:
This is a great coffee maker. The display is easy to use and for the first time I am actually programing for our morning coffee to be ready when we awake. The size does not take up unneeded space and it has great style and eye appeal. I love the blue display and how the maker looks on the counter. It is easy to clean and work. Two issues: first the hour display  reverts to "00" during the brew cycle and I went through three pots and had the same issue; second I like stronger coffee and this lovely little maker does not make the really strong coffee I personally like, however my husband does not like my stronger coffee so he is enjoying the maker. I am keeping the pot even with the  "00" hour dislay during the brew cycle, disapointed with by it but like the maker enough to over look this.

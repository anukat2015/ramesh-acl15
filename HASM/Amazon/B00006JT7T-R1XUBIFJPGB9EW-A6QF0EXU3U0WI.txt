Title: Remote does not work
Content:
I bought the unit for my daughter's room.  The remote never would sync with the unit.  I read the directions multiple times, new batteries etc.  I had the same experience with tech support that the others did.  They want me to package up the unit, mail it them and wait for them to return it or a new one.  It would cost me almost as much as buying a competitor's unit which is my plan.  I think they have a pretty marginal wireless system that sounds like it works occasionally and other times it does not.  I have worked on a lot of wireless products and my guess is they have poor QC and the wireless electronics are just not coming off the line consistently.  Look elsewhere for a heater from someone who will back it up.

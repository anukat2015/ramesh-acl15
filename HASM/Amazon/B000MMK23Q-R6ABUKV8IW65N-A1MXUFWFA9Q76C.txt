Title: highly disapointed
Content:
I bought the first one from a distributor in Ohio. My house lost heat while the eden pure was running on high heat. I took the temp blowing out of the heater and it was betwenen 90 to 100 degrees. The distributor told me it should be around 190 degrees. I sent that one back, and bought another locally. I did worse. After it blew 100 degree air for fifteen minutes it blew freezing cold air for a hour.... Its a waste of money. You are much better getting a couple of $40 heaters from walmart.

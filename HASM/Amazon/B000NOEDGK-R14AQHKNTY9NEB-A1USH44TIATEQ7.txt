Title: D40X - the camera that's almost perfect
Content:
This camera is the perfect camera for the savy consumer that wants to have most all the discernible features of an expensive SLR digital camera without the enormous price.  I have always been a Nikon fan and if you try out this camera you will see why.  I've been putting it to task for about a week now and see almost no weaknesses in its functionality.  The only thing I would like to have is maybe a few more preset programs for different conditions but that's just because I'm lazy and want the camera to do the all the work for me.  I believe any of you making this purchase will have no regrets afterwards.

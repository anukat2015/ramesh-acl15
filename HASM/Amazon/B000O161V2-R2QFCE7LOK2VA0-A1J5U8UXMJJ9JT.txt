Title: I Love my D40X
Content:
I've had this camera for 1 month now. The funny thing is that I purchased the same one from [...] and wound up returning it. Here is why:
[...] sells a kit with the D40X, a Lexar 1 GB memory card, the Nikon Bag, 2 instructional DVD's, the 18-55 and 55-200 lenses. 
The problem was that I wanted the 55-200 VR lens (which is a much better lens). New it's not that much more money...but to sell the kit lens and buy the VR version would have put me out extra $. Also the Lexar memory card is not as good as the Extreme III card that I wanted and ultimately got from Amazon. Last was the warranty. [....] changed their return policy now after 90 days you're on your own - they do not offer any extensions or service contracts, even at an additional cost. I checked with Nikon and an additional 2 years of coverage would have been $100. I ultimately got 3 additional years through Amazon for considerably less.
In the end I picked out all the components from Amazon and built my "kit" much better than the [...] version for basically the same money.
As far as the camera itself there are some features that I wish it had, such as:
Drawbacks:
No Exposure Bracketing
Limited to 3 focus points
No Depth of field preview
Knowing that I would miss these features I still purchased this camera (twice) because:
Positive:
It feels/handles great
The lenses (although limited) offer a great bang for the buck
The menu system is user friendly and a pleasure to use
The results - This camera allows me to take great pictures
Conclusion:
If you have a lot of film SLR experience consider the Canon XTI
If you are moving up from a digital point and shoot and do limited or no photo editing - get the D40 & if you crop your images for print get the D40X

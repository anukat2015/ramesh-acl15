Title: Great idea but poor quality
Content:
Purchased two of these to supplement the house furnance.  Like many I figured I would keep the house cooler and rooms we actually occupy comfortable.  On arrival one unit did not have a functioning LED.  Second unit's thermostat failed within first two weeks of use.  Fortunately this was withing 30 days of receipt so Amazon paid the return shipping and gave us a full refund.  So role the dice on this one, you may get lucky.....or not.

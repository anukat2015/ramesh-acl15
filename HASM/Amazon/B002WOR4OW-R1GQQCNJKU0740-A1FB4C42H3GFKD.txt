Title: junk
Content:
I wanted a gaming computer so I went with this one. Price was right. Amazon was offering a year of no interest. No sales tax. ect. Got the computer. No blue ray player. Its said Blue-Ray on the drive but wouldn't play blue ray discs. Called customer service. They assured me it had a blue ray player. The usual install this driver ect. Still wouldnt play blue rays. Shipped it back to Amazon. Got a full refund. Going with Alienware from costco. A little more pricey. But with costcos return policy and alienwares reputation its worth the extra cost.

Title: Point-and-shoot ease, if desired.  Fantastic results!
Content:
After several weeks of researching the Nikon D90, D40 and the Canon 50D and Rebel XSi I turned my attention to lenses and began to covet the Nikon 18-200mm VR lens.  So with that as the starting point, then the choice was D90 or D40.  While the D40 is an incredible deal right now (see [...]) I went ahead and bought the D90.  
First use of the D90 was taking night photos of the Capitol Building and Capitol Christmas tree.  Remarkably crisp photos of the dome and tree and then of the giant wreaths at Union Station.  And without a tripod!   All night shots and all out of reach of my beloved and much-used Canon SD700.  In the week since I am delighted with the vibrant color and sharply focused sunset shots, malards and my dog. So far I'm mostly shooting in the "Auto" mode and am experimenting a little with manual.  Still have to plow through the user's manual.  I find the LCD menus mostly intuitive.  Also bought the SB400 flash (and rechargeable AA batteries), an extra battery, Hoya UV filter, LowePro 1 Topload Zoom Bag, Lowe chest harness, 8 gig SD card.  
Fantastic camera, I am thrilled!

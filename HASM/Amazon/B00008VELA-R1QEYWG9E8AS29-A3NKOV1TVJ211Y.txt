Title: I like my coffee quiet and hot, thank you!
Content:
We purchased this coffee maker in a rush when our 5 year-old Cuininart Coffeemaker we loved died. Big mistake. It does make coffee, however... it's slow, very noisy, and when the pot is done brewing, the coffee is lukewarm! Skip this one!

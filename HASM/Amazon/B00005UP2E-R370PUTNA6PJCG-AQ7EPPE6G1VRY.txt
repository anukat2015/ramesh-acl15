Title: dead within a month
Content:
I thought this vacuum would be a good value after reading the reviews.  The first time I used it, I though it was okay on the floors, but not very good on the area rug.  The second time I used it, it just stopped and died.  I emptied the canister, checked the cord, detached all the parts to see if something got stuck somewhere, but couldn't bring it to life.  It's a waste of $$$.

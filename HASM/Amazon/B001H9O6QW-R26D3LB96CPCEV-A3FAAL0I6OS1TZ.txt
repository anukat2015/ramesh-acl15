Title: Great, low-maintenance Mp3 Player
Content:
I've owned this item for months now, and I can confidently say that it is the best Mp3 player that I have ever owned.  I enthusiastically endorse it.  My main criteria for purchasing mp3 players are:
1) Ease of athletic use (weight lifting, cardio, etc.)
2) General portability (on mass transit and such)
3) Sound clarity and quality
4) Intuitive and simple interface
5) Reasonable price point
I can happily say that the Sansa Clip scores highly in each area.  Therefore, if you're interested in an mp3 player for athletic endeavors, or if you simply tend to be rough with your electronic devices, then the Sansa Clip should suit your purposes due to superior portability and surprising durability, among other good qualities.
Please note that this isn't a terribly comprehensive Mp3 player, though.  The playlist function is simple and sufficient, but may underwhelm some.  It's presentation and design are clean and streamlined, but may seem threadbare to others.  I give this product a 5-star under my qualification because it perfectly suits me.  A more demanding mp3 enthusiast or audiophile may be inclined place this in the 4-star category, for a myriad of reasons.  Regardless, this is still a high quality device at the price point.

Title: This player is great!  I would suggest it to everyone
Content:
I work with computers and know some of the deficiencies of mac.  I wanted to share my music with friends and this player is great for doing it.  I have had this since last christmas and have not had one glitch.  
I have friends who have ipods and say they hate Itunes.  Well here is your chance.  I like realplayer and it allows you to use realplayer to download your songs as well as other places.  Do not stick yourself with just I tunes - get diversified.  This player is easy to use and light weight for when I go for my morning runs.  This is a great buy!

Title: carpet's cleaner than kenmore
Content:
I've been a kenmore bigot for 20 years. Living in a small town with no Sears within 45 miles, I turned to Amazon.com. I based my reviews on the cumulative reviews available on canister vaccuums. I've had my new hoover for about 5 weeks now. I love that bagless; I empty it out each time I vacuum and can easily remove small child toys from other debris. My 3 and 4 year olds say 'thank you'. I love seeing how much dirt comes out. My carpet felt so much softer after just a few uses. My allergies seem to be doing better. Kinda grosses me out to think what we were living in. I have had to wash the filter already. 
Negatives: It's not fun cleaning out the filter but it's a small cost for the job it does. I did keep the attachments from my kenmore for use with the hoover. They fit fine and are much larger and more affective than the hoover attachments, which don't all fit onboard anyway... less bulk to drag around. I also miss the 360 degree turn of the hose. 
That's why I rated a 4 instead of 5.

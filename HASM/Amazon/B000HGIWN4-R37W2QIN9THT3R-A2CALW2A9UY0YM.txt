Title: Absolutely Amazing!
Content:
This is my first SLR and what an awesome camera. I am absolutely amazed at the picture quality. You can cut and zoom pictures without losing any picture clarity and even go to almost poster size pictures and keep all the detail. My past cameras have all been Sony point & shoot type cameras and they served me well. The only downfall was the pause between shots, sometimes 2 to 3 seconds which is common in the point and shoot type digital cameras. There was no way to catch great action shots so I upgraded to an SLR and am very happy that I did. This camera will take continuous photos without losing clarity. I am amazed with this camera and have already upgraded to a 300mm telephoto lens. You are almost guaranteed not to be disappointed if you buy this camera. My only regret is that I waited this long to buy one.

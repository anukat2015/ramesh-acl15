Title: Vacuum me crazy
Content:
I was skeptical about canister vacs but was talked into buying it. I was surprised with this little vacuum. It really works great! You can use it on carpet or hardwoods/linoleum or other hard floors without changing suction heads. -You just close a valve and PRESTO, it changes the suction of the vacuum to adjust for the surface you are cleaning. It is light enough to carry around the house while cleaning as well. There is also a pivoting wheel under the base of the vacuum to help maneuver the vacuum around turns. The only thing that could make this vacuum better would be a automatic self-retracting cord. I also love the extra feature of the HEPA filter. It is a good buy for the money.

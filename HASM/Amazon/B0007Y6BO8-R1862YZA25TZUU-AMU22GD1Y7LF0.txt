Title: Not recommended
Content:
We bought our Krups FME2 in July of 2008: we liked the looks, Krups had a good reputation, & the reviews were good. This machine has been a big disappointment.
To start with the positives. This is indeed a good-looking appliance and goes well in a contemporary kitchen. It makes excellent good, hot coffee; we especially like the 1-3 cup feature. Its ability to make excellent coffee lifts my rating from one to two stars.
The negatives:
1) Programming the timer is difficult. I'm a computer network engineer and am never phased by arcane, unintuitive procedures but, really..., this thing is unnecessarily complex to set up.
2) The sight tube water level indicator is prone to air bubbles, unless you pour the water into the tank very carefully and deliberately.
3) When you pour coffee out of the carafe, it will consistently leave puddles of your brew on the counter top. You can avoid the problem by pouring very, very, slowly. Engineering a pouring spout that dribbles so reliably would possibly have been excusable to our neolithic ancestors, but it's regrettable that such a design should have got the thumbs-up in our post-industrial society. 
4) Not long after we bought it, the handle split along a seam. Part of it remains bonded to the carafe. The rest, which incorporates the hinge, stays attached to the lid and constitutes a separate dishwasher item.
5) The non-stick coating has already started lifting from the hot plate.
To sum up. It looks good and make excellent coffee, but the negatives have led me into the market prematurely for a new coffee maker.

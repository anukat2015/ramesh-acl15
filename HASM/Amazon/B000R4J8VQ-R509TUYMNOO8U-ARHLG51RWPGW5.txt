Title: My favorite way to brew coffee
Content:
I love this machine! It brews a great cup of coffee in less than 3 minutes. I can use loose grounds or coffee pods. I make my own pods so I get to enjoy my favorite blends and roasts. It is very simple to use and cleanup is a breeze. It also does a great job of brewing tea, either from tea bags or loose leaves. For the price it can't be beat. I have given these as gifts to a number of friends and family members and they all love them.

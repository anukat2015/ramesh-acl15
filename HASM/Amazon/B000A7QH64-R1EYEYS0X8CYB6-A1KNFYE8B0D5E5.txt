Title: MORE SUCK FOR YOUR BUCK
Content:
MY RECENTLY PURCHASED EURO PRO SV736 CORDLESS HAND
VACUUM CLEANER FAR SURPASSES MY PREVIOUS SHARK UNITS.
MORE POWER - BETTER COLOUR - HOLDS A CHARGE LONGER.
IF YOU HAVE PETS THIS THIS  VACUUMS  FOR YOU.
BE A CLEANER PERSON - BUY ONE TODAY.
ONE FOR THE SUGGESTION BOX HOWEVER - NEXT TIME MAKE
THE SAME VACUUM CLEANER OUT OF ALUMINIUM IT WILL
LAST LONGER.

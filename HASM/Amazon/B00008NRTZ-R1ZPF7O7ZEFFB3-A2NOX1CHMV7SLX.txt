Title: A vacuum to avoid
Content:
I wish I had read the reviews of the Bissell Digipro prior to buying this vacuum.  I would have known that debris gathers in the floor nozzle, they hose is very flimsy and tends to break, most of the exhaust escapes around the edges of the canister, the suction is quite weak and it is virtually impossible to find bags and even more difficult to find any store or internet site that carries parts for this model. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews and had to learn all of this first hand. Despite having spent several hundred dollars, I've learned from my mistake: The Digipro is going in the trash and I'm going shopping for a new vacuum.  It might be an Eureka or Hoover, both of which we've had good experiences with, but it won't be a Bissell.

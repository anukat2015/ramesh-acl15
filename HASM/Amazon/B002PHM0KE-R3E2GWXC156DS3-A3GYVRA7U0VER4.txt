Title: Awesome laptop
Content:
I got the lightening deal on this laptop on thanksgiving so I got a really good deal on this laptop.  The size and weight of this laptop is perfect for me, it's light and not too big and not too small, and I like the keyboard.  Windows 7 is great compared to Vista.  I've haven't had any problems with this laptop, I've been playing games, using internet, work, etc. on this laptop and it's been running really smooth. It's pretty fast compared to my Vista laptop and starts and shuts down quick compared to my old laptop.  Only problem is the battery life is short and the power cord that comes with this laptop is also shorter than other laptops.  I would definitely recommend buying this laptop.

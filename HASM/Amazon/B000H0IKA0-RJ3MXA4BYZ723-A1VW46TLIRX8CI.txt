Title: THE MOUSE THAT ROARED
Content:
wow! how can something so tiny sound so big? after having owned this shuffle for a few weeks now i'm really amazed at it's overall performance.
  down loading music either thru itunes or your own cd collection is a snap.
  my only real complaint might be that they (apple) includes a rather cheap set of ear buds that doesn't do the music any justice.do yourself a favor and get yourself a really good quality set of earphones,the shuffle already has the music in it,you just need a nice set of buds to let it out.
   a nice little machine for a fair price.

Title: Great Idea but poor Quality !
Content:
The Grind and Brew is a wonderful idea because we all love freshly brewed coffee from fresh beans.
This coffee maker is absolutely awful as far as quality and performance go. It cannot be left alone. If you don't watch it it may open up and splll coffee and grounds all over the counter and floor and has done this numerous times for me. Because of this, you can never use the timer.
It is impossible to keep clean because of the design and Cuisinart should be ashamed to put their name on this inferior product.
Whatever you do; DONT BUY THIS ITEM !

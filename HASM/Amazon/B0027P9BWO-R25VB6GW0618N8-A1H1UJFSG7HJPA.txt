Title: Great latptop
Content:
I got this laptop in pink and I've had it for a couple months now. I absolutely love how it looks and runs, but I agree with the other review that said the fan was a little loud. For the most part, it's pretty quiet, but when I run a CD or play a game, it gets really loud. Other than that, this laptop is great. If you're a college student like myself and looking for a reliable laptop, I'd say this would be a good choice. Hasn't failed me yet!

Title: Satisfied
Content:
Quick delivery from vendor.  Good suction and portability but the beater bar attachment is aggressive so it won't work on carpets that bunch up at all.  A wide brush tip provided with the Hoover works fine for this.  It also came with a small (5" wide) suction-powered upholstery beater brush for cleaning dog hair off of pillows and cushions.  Can't beat the convenience of the dirt collection system.

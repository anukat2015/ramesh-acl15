Title: Hose Malfunction
Content:
I had no problem with the performance of this item, but the hose keeps coming disconnected from the body of the vacuum.  It is very annoying to have to stop and reconnect it when you are in the middle of a job. I would rate the cleaning power 5 stars, if the manufacturer could fix this problem.  It works great on kitty litter.

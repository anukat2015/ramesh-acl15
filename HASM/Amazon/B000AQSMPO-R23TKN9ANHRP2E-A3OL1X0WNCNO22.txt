Title: fresh cup on the run in no time
Content:
I have my eye on the Keurig single cup machine for half a year and the price finally came down.(Amazon raised the price since then!!) So I bought it last week and am enjoying my fresh cup on the run every morning. What a luxury! It was not feasible before because of the trouble with making a full pot. Why Keurig? With Keurig,other than using the many k-cups available, I can also make my own choice of coffee with a reuserable filter.Yes, there are many choices of k-cups to choose from.It just takes placing the kcup into the holder and you can have fresh coffee almost instantaneously, whether you just want a cup, a mug or a travel mug to go. I prefer my Blue Mountain. With Keurig, I can have my choice in a single cup and there is minimal clean up afterwards.Just be careful when handling the k-cup holder assembly and look out for the sharp pinchers.It beats having to make a full pot of coffee, and then throwing the left over down the drain! That is why I do not understand the complaint about noise! It does make a bit of grinding noise when the machine initiated the water heating process, but it is over in 30 seconds. Besides, if you leave the machine on as recommended, you won't experience that start-up "noise"!When you have your fresh cup under two minutes, you will easily forget any small annoyance you may feel!

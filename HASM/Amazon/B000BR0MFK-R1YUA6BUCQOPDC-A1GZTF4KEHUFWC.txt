Title: Looks amazing, but am i missing some option for sound quality?
Content:
I'm no tech geek, i dont know about aac, and mplmnop's, I just know what sounds good. The 3rd gen Ipod looks amazing, it really does. WIth exception of the silver back which will probably scratch like a mofo. Just buy a case and you should be fine. Scratches don't really bug me as much as when I went to play a song using an expensive set of bose headphones, the sounds wasn't all that pleasing to my ears. Did they downgrade here or am I just missing something? Anyway, i'm returning it. I don't care about the cool video, I just want my music to sound like it does on my 2nd. It could all be in my head, but hey, I rather it sound good in my head. Also, the split screen is ok, it's nice eye candy, but I use this for working out and mountain biking, im not going to be needing that. If I want video on the go, I will buy something bigger and more dedicated to that.

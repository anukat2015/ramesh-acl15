Title: Nice Little Heater, But Not Super Powerful
Content:
The heater is surprisingly lightweight and seems adequate - nothing too fancy.  The plastic exterior has the feel of a sub-$40 product but it seems solid enough.  The heater works as advertised, although it is not super powerful.  I work in a basement office where I keep the home thermostat at 65°.  I was hoping the heater would warm my desk area to something more comfortable.  It definitely helps, but even when left on the Hi setting continuously, with the heater set to 73°, it never manages to get much past 68°.  I live in Georgia and the daytime temps right now average around 45° so it's not like I'm really challenging the heater.  I had hoped for a more dramatic effect.  That said, I'm still happy with the purchase ($88, including shipping) and have no regrets.

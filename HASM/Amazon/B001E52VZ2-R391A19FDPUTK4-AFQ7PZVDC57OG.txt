Title: Not what i exactly expected...
Content:
I recently purchased the 3670G after reading many very positive reviews about the product and after having a Eureka in the family that lasted 22 years (!).  I was skeptical to be honest, thinking that a vacuum at such a reasonable price could do a decent job, and I suppose I was right to feel the way I did, as I found this product to be of seemingly poor quality.  It is comprised of flimsy and very cheap looking and feeling plastic, and when I tried the floor brush, which is also made of the same material, it seemed that it would very likely create small scratches on my wood floors, so I stopped using it immediately.  The floor brush only really moves back and forth, and to make it go sideways takes effort and thus brings the potential and problem of creating small scratches.  I am used to being able to move my old floor brush in every which direction, so moving essentially only in lanes was not an option for me.
The telescopic wand is also made of very cheap looking and feeling plastic, as are the wheels, and I basically felt that although the vacuum was only $80, it was $80 too much to spend on such poor materials.  I'm sure the suction is fine and it is a usable product, as many others seemed to have good luck with it, but it was just not the product I was looking for.  I think that this vacuum would be fine for someone who may not rely on it as the primary vacuum, or maybe isn't so concerned about material quality.  I am instead going to just shell out $350 for a different brand because I know it is made of durable materials and will serve me well.

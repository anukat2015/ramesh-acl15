Title: Not Pleased - keep looking
Content:
I read all the review and thought that since this one was made in England, it had to be better. NOT TRUE ... First, it keeps coffee almost at a boil ... so as soon as coffee was done, I upluged it. Second, there were always grinds in the coffee. Third, the pot started leaking from the base after two weeks of use. Totally a bad unit.

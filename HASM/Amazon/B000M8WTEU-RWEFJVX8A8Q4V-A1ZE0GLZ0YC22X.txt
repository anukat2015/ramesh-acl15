Title: EXCELENT NOTEBOOK AND COST/BENEFIT
Content:
EXCELENTT NOTEBOOK
HI-TECH PRODUCT FROM TOSHIBA THAT'S A REFERENCE OF NOTEBOOKS IN THE WORLD.
NICE COST/BENEFIT, CONSIDERING THE MARKET OF NOTES.
ONE GOOD POINT IS 4 USB PORTS. YOU CAN PLUG A LOT THINKS AND DON'T NEED TO BY A HUB.OTHER THINK, IS 15.4 WIDESCREEN LCD, THAT IMPROVE HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGE.BATTERY LIFE IS THE SAME AS THE OTHER NOTES.DVD-RW WORKS VERY NICE IN ALL TYPE OF MIDIAS, INCLUDING DUAL LAYER DVD AND CDRW.A NEGATIVE POINT IS TOSHIBA SHOULD SEND A TRANSPORT BAG TOGETHER. THAT'S ALL.
I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT

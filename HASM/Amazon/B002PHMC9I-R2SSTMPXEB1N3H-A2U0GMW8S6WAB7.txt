Title: Nice features
Content:
This laptop has many features I needed - remote, digital media reader, and Windows 7. Most things work well except for:1 - touch pad is terrible. Constantly causing erroneous "enter". Gave up and went to mouse when I really need to be productive. 2- Battery life is poor especially on the internet. Maybe one hour. 3-Lightscribe burner has no printing software. Need to purchase from 3rd party. 4- Also uses HP Media Center instead of Windows. We don't need another media center.
Overall operation is very good. Lots of IO which is not described - 3 USB, eSATA, LAN, HDMI, modem, expansion port, 2 headphone jacks, mic in. Great for creating slideshows and videos and playing on the HD TV.
Good value

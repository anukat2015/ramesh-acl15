Title: happy enough....
Content:
This is my first digital slr, despite that fact that I have used several others. I bought this camera when it first came out when it was around 700 bucks so it really sucks that it's now down to 600. But anyway, for the price it's unbeatable, I'm an amateur photographer and it gets the job done for me. When taking landscapes however, I would recommend a polarizing filter to counter the extremely over exposed skies, but other than that it's great. Right now it's my primary camera, but in the next few days I'll hopefully be getting the 5D, not to say that I won't still use my old faithful 400D :). TO sum it all up, great camera, great price, despite the fact that it is not a professional camera like a Mark Ds II, but obviously you can't expect that....

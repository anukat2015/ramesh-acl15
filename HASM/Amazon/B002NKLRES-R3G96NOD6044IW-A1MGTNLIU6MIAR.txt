Title: Great MP3 player but has problems
Content:
I bought the creative zen x-fi 2. As soon as i got it, it was working fine and had no problems. The touch screen is a little slow and takes a while to get used to. HOWEVER there is a huge problem not with amazon but with creative they say it is compatible with Napster to go but it is defiantly not trust me I spent over an hour trying to figure something out even Napster claims they support the "creative x-fi series" so if you are planning to use this with Napster do not waste your time otherwise, it is a great product.

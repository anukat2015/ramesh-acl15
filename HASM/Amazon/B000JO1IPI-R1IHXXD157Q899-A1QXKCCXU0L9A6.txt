Title: Very happy with mine
Content:
I've had a LOT of iPods and other media players. I still have a nano 2g for the gym and skiing, but this iPod holds my whole music library, sounds great and is small enough to be easy to carry around.
The battery life is great, sound is awesome and video isn't bad though I'd never try to watch a full length movie on a screen this small.
I considered an iTouch, but I think the novelty will wear off and I'll have a 16GB music player, larger than my nano, a $399 price tag and no ability to control things like volume or song forwarding without taking it out and looking at it to run the touch screen.

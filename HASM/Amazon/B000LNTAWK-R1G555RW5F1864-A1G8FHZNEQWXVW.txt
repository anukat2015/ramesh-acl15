Title: Best Nikon dslr todate
Content:
this is my 3rd dslr (fuji s2, Nikon d70s) and it is far away the best and will most likely be my camera of choice for years to come.  The fuji took great photos but battery set-up was terrible; it's gone now.  I still have the d70s, as a back-up, but it just doesn't feel like a real camera and I'm always knocking the program knob from manual to beach scene or something like that.  
The D200 feels and sounds great, very solid; like my old F5.  All the controls are well thought-out and well placed.  You can change ISO, color balance, mode, exposure comp. all without taking your eye from the viewfinder; a big plus.  Battery life could be better but it's not a big deal; I just carry an extra battery.

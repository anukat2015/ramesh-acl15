Title: A good cuppajoe
Content:
The most important aspect of a coffee pot is the end product, and in this the Cuisinart Grind and Brew excels.  The coffee it produces is outstanding -- on par with any drip you might get from a specialty store.  The metal-clad carafe will keep the brew hot for several hours without the need for a warming plate.
The machine has a steam problem when it comes to the grinder, which causes build up of "coffee muck" to accumulate in the grinder, the cup, the feeder, and on top of the drip guard.  These rinse out quickly if you remove and rinse right after the coffee is brewed, taking only about thirty seconds to complete the job.
I've owned several different kinds of coffee makers, and this one produces the best tasting coffee so far.  I'd prefer it if the lid was a little more sturdy-feeling, and they really should do something with that steam back up into the grinder.  Those are the only things keeping me from giving this a five star rating.

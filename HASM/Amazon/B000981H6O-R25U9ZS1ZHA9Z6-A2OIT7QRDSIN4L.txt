Title: Pretty good so far
Content:
I have had this hand vacuum cleaner for about a month.  It has a good, strong suction.  My main concern with hand vacs is that in some cases their battery does not last very long.  I don't know how long the battery on this one will last.  That is why I have not given it 5 stars.  Otherwise, so far, I am happy with my purchase.

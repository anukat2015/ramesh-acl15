Title: Very Happy!
Content:
We have been very happy with the Hoover Windtunnel S3765-040 Canister Vacuum.  The turbo head does an amazing job to get the cat hair off my white furniture!  It actually not only removed the cat hair, but pulled unknown dirt from the fabric and appeared whiter! The suction is great!  I like having all the controls at my fingertips (suction control, off, etc) and LOVE THE RETRACTABLE CORD!!
 I have all laminate flooring, and the ease of use of the wand is great! My husband is tall so having the extender not only for high cleaning, but for use when cleaning the floor was a great bonus. This is my first bagless, and I was concerned, but boy am I glad!  The first time we used the vac we emptied the cup 3 times!  Bags tend to be expensive and I like the thought that all that dirt, dust, and hair are now OUT OF THE HOUSE!  Over all, we are so very happy we did not go with the Dyson, which we would have had to buy all the attachments!  For the price, we think we have found a winner!

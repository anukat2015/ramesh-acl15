Title: Not too bad
Content:
This was the first MP3 player I ever bought. Yes, it only holds about 50-something good-quality MP3 files, but it cost about $30 and fit into my pocket easily while walking/running. I also like the fact that it came with earphones, not earbuds.
This would be good if you are a parent and are hesitant about buying your kids a more expensive player that they might break or lose within a month. The only thing I didn't like is having to get batteries (I have an IPod now, so it charges on the computer).

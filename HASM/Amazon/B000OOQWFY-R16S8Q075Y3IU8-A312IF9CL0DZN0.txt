Title: Pretty good except for a few things
Content:
The good things about this machine are:
1. It's small and makes 2 perfect 8 oz. cups of coffee
2. Coffee is hot
3. The stainless steel carafe is easy to take care of because you don't have to worry about it breaking.
4. The filter and components are easy to use and clean
Things that need improving:
1. You can't see the water level.
2. It's not digital so you can't program it.
3. The hotplate is really too hot so if I leave it on after the coffee is made it burns it pretty quickly. This is a hassle because I always have to listen for when the coffee is finished brewing so I can turn the machine off.
4. It is a little difficult to take the pot in and out because of the filter apparatus.  I was used to having the pot in place then putting in the coffee in the filter and closing it.  It's not possible to do that with this machine.  You have to close the filter before putting the pot in place.
5. The filter drips water when you open it to empty it.
I chose this machine because it had such high ratings but I think if I had to do it over again I'd choose the Mr. Coffee one.  I only went with this because of the stainless steel carafe and because it claimed to make hot coffee but now I have to watch the machine so not good if I need to have the coffee sit there for a little bit. Can't really comment about the quality of coffee though because I think that has more to do with the bean than the machine.

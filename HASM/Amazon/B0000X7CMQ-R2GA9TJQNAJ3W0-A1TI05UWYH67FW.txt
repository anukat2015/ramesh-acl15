Title: Everything but those last 2 cups
Content:
#1 - Stylish, looks GREAT on the counter.
#2 - Coffee tastes GREAT. I read many of those other reviews, which help, yet had never experienced why a thermal carafe tastes better than a warming plate, which must indeed over-cook the coffee.
#3 - Easy to use, fill with water and clean. And not much to worry about breaking, chipping or cracking. NO glass!
#4 - Yes, the coffee indeed stays hot for a long time.
#5 - It brews faster than our old coffee makers.
Just wish it held 12, rather than 10 cups. Overlooked that detail when researching and have had to re-train myself on quantities.

Title: Love It!
Content:
We've had our percolator for about 4 years now &amp; use it EVERY DAY!  Makes wonderful coffee-we've thrown our old automatic Mr. Coffee away!  After 4 years, the power cord has finally gone-but I'm planning a trip to the hardware store to replace it. Even so, I've been pleased with its performace-even if I did have to replace the entire unit, 4 years of constant use is worth it!!

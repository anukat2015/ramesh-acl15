Title: Great thermal coffeemaker
Content:
I've had this coffeemaker for just about two months now, and have been very happy with it so far. When I first got it I ran through a full load of water, to see if it would overflow on a full brew. The first time I used it, yes it did overflow a bit, but that was due to me putting a touch too much water in the reservoir. You have to make sure you set the reservoir on a completely flat surface, I made the mistake of setting it in our slightly rounded sink. Due to the angle it was sitting at, what I thought was 10 cups was in reality a bit more. After I learned that, I haven't had any problems with overflowing at all. I really like the removable reservoir, I can leave the coffeemaker tucked back under the cupboards and not have to pull it out in order to fill it with water.
The lid of the carafe is a bit touchy to get on, sometimes it takes a couple tries to get the threads lined up. But it's nothing that takes longer than an extra 30 seconds for me. The carafe is excellent at keeping coffee hot. It comes out hot, and stays hot for several hours. We previously tried a Cuisinart thermal carafe machine, and the coffee didn't even start out hot from that one, only warm. This one brews hot coffee that stays that way for a long time.
The removable filter basket is nice, you can carry it right over to the trash to empty it. The unit looks pretty sharp on the counter as well. Overall this is a great coffeemaker and I'm very pleased with the purchase. Time will tell if it doesn't fall apart, but two months in it's a good buy.

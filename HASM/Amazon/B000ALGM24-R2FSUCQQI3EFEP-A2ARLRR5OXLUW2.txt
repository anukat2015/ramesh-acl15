Title: Manual temperature adjustment relief
Content:
The Hunter 44550 was a very easy item to install; the wire labels makes even a novice installer feel confident. It took me roughly 15 minutes to complete the whole installation and maybe another 10 minutes to follow the daily programming instructions. 
We just got therefore I cannot say if the projected savings is true. But it definitely beats the manual adjustment one has to do with regular thermostat. No need to worry about forgetting.

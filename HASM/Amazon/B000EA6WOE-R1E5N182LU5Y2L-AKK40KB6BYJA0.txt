Title: After 18 Months, Still Satisfied
Content:
I previously had an iriver, which was very frustrating to synchronize and broke after about a year.  Upgraded to this unit, which I have been extremely pleased with.  I sync through Windows Media Player and it works perfectly and quickly.  Sound is great, unit is pretty durable, battery life is pretty good.  My only complaint is that the screen is hard to see in sunlight, which was actually a strength of the iriver.  I also dislike the touchpad and was extremely frustrated with it at first (even after setting it to the least sensitive level), but grew accustomed to it after a couple of months.    
I have used up the 20 GB and am now in the market for a 30 GB or larger unit.  I'm surprised there aren't more to pick from.

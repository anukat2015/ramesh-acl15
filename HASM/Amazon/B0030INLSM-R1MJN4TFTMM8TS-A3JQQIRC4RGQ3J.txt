Title: Too Big!
Content:
At 115.6 inches diagonal the screen is 7.5 feet wide by 6 feet high.  It's just not convenient to use as a laptop at this size.  Instead of being able to use it on the plane, they made me check it and pay an oversize baggage fee.  On a positive note, it's great for my friend who is visually impaired.  The built in keyboard is a monstrosity, but he hooked up a wireless keyboard and mouse and he can really see this screen.  If you order this, be forewarned that you'll need some help getting it into the house when it arrives.
Cheers,

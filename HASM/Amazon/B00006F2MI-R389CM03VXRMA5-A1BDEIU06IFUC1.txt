Title: Overpriced, shoddy and disappointing
Content:
We bought this coffeemaker with a gift card we received as a wedding present. We thought that with the price and the Cuisinart name it would have to be good. Boy, were we ever wrong! 
The first thing that broke was a small rubber plug in the top of the grinding chamber. That lasted all of two months. A minor inconvenience, to be sure, and one easily fixed with a little swatch of duct tape, but for the money we paid a touch more quality should be expected.
Next, after about 6 months the chamber that held the water started refusing to empty completely. Running cleaning solution through the coffeemaker helped initially, but after a week or so, the problem would recur. We use filtered, softened water, so it shouldn't have been due to any deposits.
Finally, after a year of daily use and weekly cleanings, the machine just stopped working. Emails to Cuisinart Customer Service went unanswered and I went in search of another grind and brew coffeemaker. I found that Mr. Coffee had come out with a grind and brew model and it has proved to be everything this piece of overpriced junk wasn't-- cheaper by half, easy to clean, easy to use, and reliable.
Avoid this Cuisinart. Spend half the money on a Mr. Coffee and you won't be sorry!

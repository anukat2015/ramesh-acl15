Title: A good, sturdy machine
Content:
We purchased this model after researching online for several weeks.  Overall we are very satisfied and would recommend this to others.  Pros:  sturdy build, great suction, easy to maneuver, washable filters, easy to find replacement parts, good attachments, works on bare floors to shag carpet.  Cons:  dirt cup is messy to empty, cord is a bit short and the head squeaks in bare floor mode.  This is the best machine we have tried so far.  It works well on all floor types and gets up dog hair, Cheerios and fine silt.  We vacuum every other day and so far it has held up to the use.  I vacuumed 3x the first day.  First use pulled up fuzz/dog hair, second and third use pulled up fine silt and the carpet looked a shade lighter.  Wow!

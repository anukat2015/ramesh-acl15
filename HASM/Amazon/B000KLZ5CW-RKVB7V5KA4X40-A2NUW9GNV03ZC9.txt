Title: Finally, something that works right
Content:
We bought one of these over the summer after trying 2 other brands. This was by far with superior performance and appeal.  I use this mostly in the kid's room that is about 200+sqft and run it most of the day. No issues at all. I wasn't venting the exhaust initially but after attaching the vent hose, it worked better than expected. This item is heavy but can be wheeled on an even floor. Nice color and great price.

Title: Highly Recommended
Content:
This heater is the best I have ever owned. It provides plenty of heat and is cheap to run costing less than 18 cents an hour using a 20lb cylinder (thats on low setting 4000 btu). I read conflicting reviews concerning wether or not a filter was needed. I would like to clear this up once and for all. The manufacture does recommend in the owners manual to use a filter when operating from a 20lb cylinder. The cost is 10 dollars and includes shipping. I have not ordered or used this filter so I cannot say how it operates. If there are any doubters you can download the owners manual right here at amazon.

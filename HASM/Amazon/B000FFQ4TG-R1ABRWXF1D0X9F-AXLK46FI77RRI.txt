Title: Easy to use
Content:
I like it but it takes a bit of getting used to.  I also do not leave it on all day as I brew only one two pots at breakfast and then nothing until the next day.  I was disappointed in the quality of the plastic filter basket and carafe top. Just not up to the quality of the rest of the machine. I also use the regular "Mr Coffee" basket filters and they work just as well or better than the Bunn filters.  I would have given it 5 stars but for the plastic quality.  The coffee is excellent and brews remarkably fast.

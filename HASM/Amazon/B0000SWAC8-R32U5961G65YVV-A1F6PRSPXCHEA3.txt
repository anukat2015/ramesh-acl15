Title: Poor Service
Content:
The Electrolux Olygen vacuum clean purchased from Amazon arrived with a broken wand connector. I took it in for service, waited 3 weeks for a different colored part to arrive, and was told by Electrolux to live with it. So now I have a brand new patchworked vacuum cleaner. It might come as a surprise to their customer service department, but when someone buys a new vacuum cleaner that's what they expect! Consider how they treat their customers before purchasing.

Title: Stay away from this one!
Content:
I've had Krups before, but this one will insure that I never buy another. It makes fair coffee, but luke warm expresso (if you can call that  expresso). The handle on the espresso pot broke off after approximately 12 uses. Also, note that his unit does not have an automatic shut off.

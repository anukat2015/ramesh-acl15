Title: Best digital camera, replaced my film Nikon SLR!
Content:
I have finally found a camera to replace my Nikon AF 35mm film camera.  Over the last 10 years I have owned many digital cameras, mostly point a shoots, and this camera blows them all away.  Other than the dynamic range of film (latitude, or contrast range), it may actually take better pictures than my SLR film camera.  At 100iso I could see no digital noise, and details are razor sharp, so maybe no noise reduction/line enhancement is being used either.  I just shot 100 pictures, and the battery isn't even showing any discharge.  The camera is lighting fast!  No waiting for the camera to boot up (turn on).  You pick it up turn it on take a picture.   It has just about every feature you could want in a digital camera except movies, but no SLR can take movies yet.  Also would be nice if it had HDMI for digital TVs as Nikons higher end cam does. The camera is light weight, yet feels high quality.  Controls are easy to use, and the viewfinder shows status of everything.  The camera focuses very fast, faster than any other camera I have owned, and it's quiet.  The only noise this cam makes is the mirror flipping up, and even that is quiet.  The camera can haul off 3 10.2MP pictures per second!  This is nothing short of amazing.  
Before I purchased this Nikon D40x, I did weeks of research, looked at canon, sony, and panasonic, and really this is the camera to have.  I even had the budget to buy the Nikon d3000 for $2000.00, but really this camera does what I need.  Sure it's limited to only new lens, but if you don't have a bunch of old lens that need a motor drive, buy this camera.  
Nikon, you did a great job!

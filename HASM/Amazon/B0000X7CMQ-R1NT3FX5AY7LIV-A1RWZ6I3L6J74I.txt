Title: Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker
Content:
I like the thermal carafe, last cup is as good as the first. I have used subject appliance daily for about 4 weeks without problem or mishap. Amazon had the best price for this appliance and delivery was faster than expected. Most of the reviews, read prior to purchase, praised the Zojirushi EC-BD15 for brewing a superior tasting cup of coffee. On a first cup basis I cannot detect much difference over what I was able to brew with my old Mr. Coffee, a less expensive appliance.

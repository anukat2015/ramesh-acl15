Title: Love my Nikon d5000, even with the recall!
Content:
I purchased my Nikon D5000 on June 14, 2009.  I also registered it on line with Nikon.  I received an email on July 16 stating the problems and was given a date as to check the serial number for my camera to see if it was one that would fall into the category of power control failure.  I received a follow up email reminding me of the information.  My camera did fall into that category so the website had a label to ship it back to Nikon through UPS 2 day air, free of charge.  I shipped my camera on July 24, they recieved it in CT. on July 28th and to my surprise and delight it was sitting on my front porch on the morning of August 3rd.  A turn around of 11 days which also included two weekends and 4 days of transportation.  Not only have I always been impressed with Nikon's products but the professional service of this recall has turned out to be a wonderful experience.  So please do not be discouraged about the recall, this camera has so many wonderful features, I recommend it for people like me who are just paparazzi moms/soon to be gramma or the professional photographers.  Go to http://www.nikondigitutor.com/eng/d5000/index.shtml and watch this tutorial on this awesome camera.  You will be sold on it as well.

Title: Awkward to fill & remove grounds
Content:
Don't buy this coffeemaker if you have a cabinet above the location where you put the coffeemaker.  It is too tall to remove the grounds basket,or for that matter fill both coffee & water.  You have to pull the appliance out of it's location to do both operations.  Doesn't sound like much, but after awhile it gets to be a pain.  Makes good coffee, but definetly has design problems.

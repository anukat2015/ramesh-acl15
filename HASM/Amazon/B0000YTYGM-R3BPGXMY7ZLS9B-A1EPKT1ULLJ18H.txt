Title: Very impressed
Content:
The motivation for buying this coffeemaker was that it came in stainless and white (rather than stainless and black) and that it was among the more highly rated of the stainless and white coffeemakers.  Thus far, I am very impressed.  I made a full pot of coffee at 9 am, and when I poured another cup at 5 pm, the coffee was still steaming.  The coffee itself was very good also.
As some reviewers have noted, the machine is a bit finicky.  The lid must be properly threaded to the carafe and the coffee basket pushed all the way in, otherwise you are cruising for a real mess.  If you're just shy of comotose first thing in the morning, you would be better off using the programmable feature and preparing your coffee (and its maker) when you're awake.  I love the fact that you don't need to futz with the carafe lid prior to pouring your coffee, and that it keeps the coffee hot all day.
All said, it's a great coffeemaker, but not markedly different than my previous thermal carafe Mr. Coffee, which was half the price.  The only reason I rate this four stars instead of five is that it seems overpriced.  The technology is not noticeably better than "lesser" brands on the market, and it's twice the price.  I think if they brought it down to $75 or less, it would be a better value.

Title: Good wireless  card and screen
Content:
I give this laptop a rating of 5 because it run good out of the box. have to other laptop this one run the best no problems at all. very good wireless card can go outside and still pick up signal. screen like my hp very high resolution. battery last long. good for work. speed amost the same as my dell p4 3.2ht, dell beat by a few points in the benchmark test.
but didn't get it for speed. drive could have been better, had to put more ram. but it a very good laptop if you are taken it to work or on the go.

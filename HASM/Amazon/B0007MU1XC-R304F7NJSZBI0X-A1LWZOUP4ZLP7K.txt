Title: Worst electronics purchase I've ever made
Content:
Absolutely terrible. That's the best two-word description I can give this player. 
As many other reviewers on this and other sites have indicated, the SonicStage software is a laughable abomination- as if they outsourced the coding to a group of novice programmers with bad senses of humor. Moreover, if you're lucky enough to get your songs onto the player, the player scrolls through tracks at a mind-numbingly slow pace- for my modest collection (roughy 1k tracks) scrolling took 2-3 seconds per movement. So scrolling through the entire collection in order would take roughly 2-3k seconds, 30-50 minutes. That's simply unacceptable for a device that costs as much as this.
Two notable positives were sound quality and form factor. The device looks and sounds good, and if all you wanted to do was turn it on, press play and let it run, it'd be a great product. But if you like to flip through tracks, my best advice is this- buy something else because it will drive you out of your mind.
Thank goodness for reasonable return policies.

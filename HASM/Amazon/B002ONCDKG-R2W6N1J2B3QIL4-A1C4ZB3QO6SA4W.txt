Title: Excellent laptop you should all buy this!!!
Content:
I don't know with other people but I think this laptop is great!!! Except for the battery, it doesn't really last for 4 or more hours maybe just a little bit more than 2 hours depending on your usage and your running programs and projects and other devices connected to it.
    No offense to other reviewers but the issue about the touch pad is not really a big deal to give this product 3 stars. You can always adjust the settings on the pointer preferences to make it more sensitive. 
    I admit that the looks of this laptops isn't so good compared to SONY laptops and other brands but it still looks ELEGANT to me. But of course looks shouldn't be our main concern in buying computers, we should be more concerned on the machine's performance. 
    Plus concidering the price, it's really cheap for it's specifications and features. I am so glad that HP sells it's products with affordable prices yet with excellent performance. This is actually my second HP laptop , I was plannig to buy and try another brand of laptop but still HP provides the best specifications and features in an affordable price so I still bought this machine.

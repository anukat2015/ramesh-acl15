Title: Great little laptop
Content:
This is only our second laptop and first Toshiba.  So far we're very satisfied!  It's light to carry around and is very quiet.  It does a great job with Word, Excel, web browsing, etc.  Primarily, it's used for online college classes and performs wonderfully around the house, and sometimes in the car.  The battery life is halfway decent when set on Balanced (in Vista's power settings).  I think it gets about three hours with WiFi on, web browsing, and Word.  Overall, we're happy!

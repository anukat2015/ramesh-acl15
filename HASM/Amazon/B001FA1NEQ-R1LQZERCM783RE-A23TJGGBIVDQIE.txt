Title: Love it
Content:
Having upgraded from a three-year old 1st generation nano, I was very impressed with this updated version as soon as I began to use it. I love pretty much everything about it: the price, appearance, the sound quality, the battery life, video, the extra features including some fun games and genius... everything. Out of all that, though, the interface and iTunes, I think, are probably the best features. The software is just so easy to use and intuitive. Nothing else comes close to what Apple has created, not even Zune (no matter how hard it may try). Just about the ONLY things I can complain about it are the tiny scroll wheel which can make games somewhat frustrating; and the tilt control, which is a tad bit too sensitive (I recommend turning off tilt cover flow if you like to blindly control your ipod from inside your pocket). Ultimately, the good FAR outweighs the bad, and I am very glad to have bought this iPod, especially since I saved $20 by buying on Black Friday.
Worth every dollar =)

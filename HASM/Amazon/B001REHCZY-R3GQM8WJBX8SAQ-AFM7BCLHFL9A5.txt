Title: Black & Decker Spacemaker Review
Content:
We replaced an old Black & Decker SpaceMaker Coffee Maker with this new model SDC740B.  It works great and has a sleek design that appears to take less space than the prior unit.  The only issue is the top seems to come loose which will cause coffee to leak out of the top if you aren't paying attention.  You have to snap the top in place almost every time you use it and then the coffee pours correctly.  That's the only issue we have found with the unit so far.

Title: Good Heater, Cheap, Many Saftey Features.
Content:
This KeroHeat Ct-1100 Must be seasoned before normal use (all kerosene heaters do). Like a cast iron pan if you skip this it will smell and smoke. [...]. I did what the site said, and I have been quite pleased with my results. What you do is, start with a quarter tank of Kerosene, burn the heater on high for about a half hour, until the top plate is red hot. Back to low for a hour. Finally back to high for a hour and let run out of fuel. I use CLEAR kerosene and the deodorant additive as well. Don't get too fixed on a certain sent, this unit is too efficiant and you will not have the sent filling the air in your home. I also recommend the KeroHeat HMN-110 radiant and KeroHeat CV-2230 convection. **Dont forget to run the Humidifire in your home**

Title: Great heater
Content:
This is a great little heater. Only two problems I have with this is that the degree numbers wear off after about a month and the 7 hour timer can be a nuisance. They should have an overide switch, for continuous operation; as it went off a couple of times during the evening and it was cold. Other than that this is a great little heater, which doesn't dry out the air and is quiet.

Title: Great for the price
Content:
I have no carpet and no fabric upholstery, so no dust, no speck, no crumb gets hidden or absorbed in plushy pile - this vacuum keeps everything under control beautifully.  It is stylish when it's just hanging out in the room (not exactly an Electrolux, but not exactly $600 either), and easily stowed in a couple feet of closet space when it's not.  It moves easily and the hose is long enough to get into the deepest nooks of the sofas without gymnastics being involved.  The cord zips into its pocket with a few button presses - still beats winding it around your elbow - and that's about the only glitch I can mention.  As for the suck factor - this machine gets everything and cleanly (no blowy, dusty weirdness), without scratching leather, wood, tile or laminate. I have two toddler boys and two indoor/outdoor terriers, and it gets all the white little Jack Russell hairs, all the paw dirt, all the freeze-dried fruit dust, all the Cheerios, smashed and whole.  It is very easy to dump the dirt, and no bags to buy.    The price is unbeatable for this kind of quality. I've had Kenmore, Kirby and Eureka and none have compared.  Don't chintz out, but don't overbuy - this will do the job and last.

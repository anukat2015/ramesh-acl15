Title: Decent but DEAD in less than a year
Content:
I got the Lasko 6350 at Tar-jay back in January (around $50).  Despite short-comings like beeping loudly at every button push, lack of a fan-only option, and an inconsistent thermostat, I was overall pretty content with its operation.
I used it moderately to keep my bedroom comfortable from January through May or so, then gave it an extended summer vacation.  Brought it back on the scene around early October.  It was working fine for a day or two, then just refused to turn on.  When I plug it in the little red power light still comes on, but it doesn't beep anymore.  No buttons on the unit or remote get any kind of response.  It is basically in a vegetative state.
I have to add - I thought the stand would be a good idea since my bed is pretty high.  I wasn't thinking about the fact that the heat is going to rise anyway, and having the heat start about a foot off the ground makes it more difficult than it should be to warm your feet if you're sitting or standing.  I just ordered a different tower heater that does not have a stand and does have a fan-only option for when you just want some circulation and/or white noise.

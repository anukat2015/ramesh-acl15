Title: Great Camera, but skip the kit lens
Content:
Excellent quality photos and all the manual adjustiblity you could ever want.
BUT before you buy the camera with the 18-55 kit lens, THINK ABOUT BUYING THE BODY BODY ONLY AND A LENS SEPARATELY.  The lens is very cheaply made and at f3.5 it limits what you can do in low light situations.  I would suggest the Canon EF 50mm/f1.8 II as a good starter lens.

Title: I LOVE IT
Content:
I am addicted.  No more Starbucks for me.  It is so worth the money.  I never thought I would stop getting a latte everyday from Starbucks but with the economic crunch, this little machine is perfect.  Starbucks is still great for a once-in-awhile treat.  But this is perfectly YUMMY for everyday --- Cappuccinos and Lattes are perfectly frothed.
Be careful when setting up - I did not read the instructions carefully :( and did not lock down before priming and almost broke the handle.  Make sure you lock it down before moving the lever to the right/left.
HAPPY BREWING :)

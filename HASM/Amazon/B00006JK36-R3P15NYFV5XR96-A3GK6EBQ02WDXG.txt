Title: Fujis s2 pro
Content:
Excellent value in this camera for the price. Camera is well balanced & feels good to hold.Quick in raw mode to record especially with new high speed fuji compact flash cards  transfer rate being 6mb per second .... writing files @ 12mb!
This giving around 76 images per 1 GB card.Puchased seperatley a Nikon 24&#62;120mm zoom which I'm also very happy especially with its zoom range & image stalisation, lense works fine & balances well with Camera body.Fuji S2 controls are well laid out & easy to use.Has both firewire & USB connection.
Gripes:- image through view finder is a bit too small likewise LCD..could be bigger say 2.5 cm. Second battery type is 123a bit of a pain as expensive & not rechargable (REQUIRES 2).Also 4 NiMetal Hydride AA'S can be used which are rechargable...these work fine...no complaints here .RAW images cannot be used in older versions of Photo Shop.
Photo Shop CS perhaps has conversion for Fuji RAW format. A light edition Raw format converter is supplied on cd, as is Adobe Elements.The S2 is also supplied with software on CD to convert Raw images to Tiff.Camera has accurate exposure & good tonal qualities... resolution is also greater than other digital 6mp slr's...interesting to see how S3 Pro turns out...& how it stacks up against the likes of Canon D20.

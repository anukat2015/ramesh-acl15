Title: i looooove it!
Content:
im new to the whole ipod thing...this is my first. i got a 'factory serviced' one (cheap) and i EFFIN looove it!
it showed up fast, had a slight dent in the back casing. but works great! (has since picked up a few more dents and chips as ive dropped it a few times...but still chugs along like new)
for all of us who remember '8track tapes' (what were we on????) this is about the neetest thing in the world...music. podcasts. movies. tv shows. and more in the palm of your hand! wow!
mine is the 3rd gen 4gig model...and since i discovered you can watch movies and tv shows on it...im itchin for a model with more mem...but this is fine for now (picture is crystal clear and sound is awesome!)
great item! very happy!

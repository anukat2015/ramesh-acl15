Title: Makes Cleaning Almost Fun!
Content:
I really hate vacuuming but this little baby makes it well... kind of exciting. It has cool controls in the handle that let you turn on the machine and set the suction level (indicated with nifty little lights.) You can turn on just the suction (up to three levels) or the suction plus the floor brush. If you have ever wrestled a throw rug out of the jaws of an overzealous vacuum cleaner, you will really appreciate the suction only setting. This machine is lightweight and easy to carry from room to room (unlike some of those upright monsters.)It also comes apart in a snap. To clean out the filter cup you simply slide it out and tip it into the garbage. No mess. Oh, and it has a cord retractor too! No more winding around and around and around. You just step on the little pedal and in it goes! I have been using this machine for several months now and am hoping it lasts me for a long, long time! I'll be back if it doesn't.
    Spring 2010 Update- Still have this vacuum and it works well but the handle seems to be loosening up and the vacuum controls (that are contained in the handle) fail to work sometimes. Usually I just rattle it a bit. Overall, I think it was a very good buy.

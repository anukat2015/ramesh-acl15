Title: Great Suction - Durability improved versus prior versions
Content:
Have had previous versions due to its great suction/cleaning.  Have 2 dogs and 2 todlers/babies, with one of them alergic to dog hair, thus need great cleaning.  This provides.  Prior versions had issues with durability in the hose connections and had replaced several times due to wearing out as you disconnect and reconnect often for using tools.  This one has a telescoping wand with a singular release and seems much more durable in the above problem area.  Only negative is that it lost a feture where you could turn down the suction by letting other air in and without this it makes doing things like drapes or small rugs much harder.

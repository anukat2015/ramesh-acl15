Title: Outstanding product if you know how to clean it
Content:
I have had this product for several years and have never been dissatisfied.  People complain that it is hard to clean, I disagree.  I rinse the guts of the machine and put them in the dishwasher, no problem...  Once a month I take my kitchen hand sprayer with very hot water, hold the coffee maker upside down at an angle in the sink and gently spray all over inside the machine working the spring loaded mechanism that holds the grounds.  After all these years I am ordering another and keeping the first one for parts.....  In my opinion this is the finest grind and brew I have ever owned....

Title: Canon 40D A+
Content:
I am a serious amateur photogapher & I love this camara.  The ISO is amazing.  Very noise free, good prints in lowlight up to ISO400.  In daylight up to ISO800!  1600 a little noisy but still very useable especially with provided software post processing.  Autofocus with Canon lenses has been spot on.  Love the 3" LCD. Highly recommend for any one looking for a 1.6x crop DSLR.

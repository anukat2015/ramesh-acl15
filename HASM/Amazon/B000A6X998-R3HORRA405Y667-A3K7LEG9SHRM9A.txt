Title: Completely stopped working in under 2 months
Content:
The item generated a lot of heat. If you had asked me yesterday, I would have given this unit five stars. This item completely stopped working in  less than 2 months. Item shipped on the January 9th, I picked it up from my building management on January 21st, and item broke on March 2nd.  The item was only used a couple of hours a day and was only used on the lowest heat setting.  I am extremely dissapointed by this unit. I researched this heater from Consumer Reports, before deciding to buy it. I should also note that the plug was slightly discolored as if it was over-heating (possible fire hazard). So I guess I should feel fortunate that it actually stopped working and did not cause a fire.  My 30 day period for returns through Amazon has expired, so I cannot get a replacement for this lemon.  Maybe this unit was just a defective unit.  Suffice it to say that I will be looking elsewhere for a replacement heater as I don't like to throw away my hard earned money. The two Delonghi models I have are both still working after two years (although they could not compare in terms of the warmth you feel direcly on you).  I want my money back or a replacement unit....

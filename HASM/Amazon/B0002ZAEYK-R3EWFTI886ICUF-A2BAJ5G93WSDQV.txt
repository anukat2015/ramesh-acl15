Title: Great system, great looks
Content:
I received the iPod U2 Special Edition for Christmas. Not because I'm a huge U2 fan (a fan, but not a huge fan), but because it so matches my car's interior. Hey, who said all gifts have to have a practical, reasonable explanaition?
I love it, and there are some errors in earlier reviews which I wanted to address.
1.  This is a 20Gb unit, not 40, and a 3rd generation. It does not have a color screen or photo viewing options. It DOES act as an external hard drive on both Windows and Mac systems.
2.  iTunes is VERY easy to use. It can automatically search an online database of tracknames and then update your iTunes and iPod for those CD's that don't report that info automatically. It is a two click process. Under Advanced, just select Get CD Track Names. Then under File, select Update Song's on iPod. If yur CD is not found in the online database, you can help the iPod community under Advanced by Submit CD Track Names.
3.  The iPod, no matter what flavor you get, is the BEST music player on the market. Hands down. Sound, ease of use, design, and available accessories (including car kits by many auto manufacturers like BMW, MINI, etc.) make it the best. Apple has many plans for the iPod, making it the center of its digital world. Look for it to have even more features in future updates.
I don't regret waiting for this generation of iPod, I don't need the picture viewing of the newer models, and this is the coolest looking iPod of all!

Title: Best at what it does
Content:
I recently purchased this brand and type after checking several others for the purpose of heating my 2-car, 440 sq ft, insulated garage.  After spending literally hours poring over other suitable types, I decided on this radiant heater.  It is very conservative on usage of propane, even left on medium and high.  I had it in a 1200 sq ft area in below freezing temperatures for about 10 hours and though it wasn't terribly warm while I was working it was enough to keep the chill off and I wasn't even shivering!  It heats up fully in a matter of a couple minutes and even when I knocked it over it didn't damage it at all.  Most of the other units I looked at were in the $200-$300 range for the area desired and were electric.  I am very happy with this little heater and I'm sure you, given similar needs, will find it to be reasonably priced, effective and efficient.

Title: Presto delivers warm, well-brewed coffee
Content:
Except for the hot plate being perhaps a little too hot, the Presto percolator delivers warm, well-brewed coffee in a jiffy.  I normally use a French press, but in the winter it's a bit too chilly for that, so the Presto became a handy substitute, and I can use my French press for measuring fluids.

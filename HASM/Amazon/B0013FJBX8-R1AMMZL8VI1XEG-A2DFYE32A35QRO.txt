Title: Best laptop I ever owned -- exceeded expectations!!
Content:
This was my first time buying a Mac.  I needed a new laptop, and, at a friend's suggestion, I gave it a try.  Wow, I was so pleasantly surprised.   So well engineered and made, and the included software is fantastic.  I had a few programs that work only on a PC environment, but I had no problem installing Parallels and then Windows XP as a virtual machine.  PC programs work fine.  I think I may be slowly converting to Mac for all my computing needs.  I'm hooked.  Not to be foreshadowed is Amazon's excellent service and pricing.

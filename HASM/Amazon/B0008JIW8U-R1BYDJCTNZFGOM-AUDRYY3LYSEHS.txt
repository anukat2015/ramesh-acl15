Title: Unit Failed After About 1 Year
Content:
It worked okay.  Then, one morning the clock was flashing.  I figured it was due to a power outage.  I could not get the unit to respond.  All the mechanical workings are still fine.  The main power to the unit is fine.  But, I cannot get it to work because of the failed electronics.

Title: apple has it cheaper
Content:
right now you can get Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle AAC/MP3 Player Metal (2nd Generation) that is refurbished (but with 1 full year apple warranty) so whats there to lose? if it breaks in 6month, just go claim the warranty it is a great product but since there is 3rd generation out, i suggest a lower price would be efficient to selling this product

Title: Krups FMF5
Content:
This coffee maker is not up to the usual Krups standard.  The latch to open the coffee filter doesn't always work.  Everything on this machine looks and feels cheap-plastic.
Also, why does Krups require you to purchase a new permanent filter with every purchase?  Older model filters never fit in the newer models.
If you fill the water even slightly over the 10 cup line (yes the instructions tell you not to) you WILL burn yourself when you take the pot out.  The hot coffee will run right over the top of the carafe and onto the handle.
I was always a loyal Krups customer, but will rethink my position on that when making my next appliance purchase.

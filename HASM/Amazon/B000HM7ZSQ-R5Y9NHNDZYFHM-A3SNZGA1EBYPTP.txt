Title: Cools you right down
Content:
We had this thing for our wedding last June... very hot day, humid, everybody was sweaty... well this thing took care of that and was very pleasent to have. You have to figre out the right distance so you don't get soaked, but that's not hard. Nice back yard luxury!
The fan is easy to hook up to water and electricity, can sit outside all summer and won't blow over in a storm... it has a very heavy stand!

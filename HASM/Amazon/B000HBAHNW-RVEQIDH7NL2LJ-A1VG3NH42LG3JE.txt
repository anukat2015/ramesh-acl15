Title: Amazing Miele
Content:
I am thrilled with the Miele system. The bags caught most, if not all (hey I don't have a microscope) of my dust, dust mites and their and my  blech. I live in Oregon, land of 24/7 365 moisture. So dust mites love it here. And I happen to live in a valley... grass grass pollen pollen. I also have a cat that loves to quite literally  roll around in the dirt. After testing a Miele Aquarius on my entire carpeted apartment, it was a no brainer to get a Miele. The first night I had my loaner from a friend I thoroughly cleaned my bedroom and that night I slept better. In the morning instead of going through a dozen or more tissues I just needed one. I also did not have to blow my nose in the middle of the night. I already have an amazing non-toxic mattress that the mites can't live in so I knew the problem was carpet, dust and moisture related. I ended up with the Gemini Miele as I don't need the Automatic (extra function) of the Aquarius. I did want the backlit knob indicator which is why I went with the Gemini over the Callisto. I purchased through Witbecks and they have been amazing in service and I would definitely buy from them again. 
ps People, if you have allergies... look at your laundry detergent too.... I am simply flabbergasted how many people say they have allergies and use scented detergent, fabric softener, and dryer sheets!!!!!! That synthetic fragrance is definitely exacerbating  any allergies you may have. That includes any 'plug-ins' or the like. Those products are actually quite toxic over time, they damage your olfactory senses (nose) and pollute the air, not freshen it.

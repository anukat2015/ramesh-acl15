Title: LOVE my new Hoover
Content:
Like the person who commented before me, I too RARELY write reviews for products, but I was so excited when I tried out my new vacuum that I felt  inclined to write.
Our current vacuum is a Kirby Diamond Edition ($1000+) model, which is about 6 years old but supposed to be the king of all vacuums. It works fine, but my roommate is moving and taking it with him. 
So today, I tried out the new Hoover. I have a small, 1200 sf townhouse, with hardwood floors downstairs and carpet upstairs. 
It took me less than 1 minute to assemble everything, and the vacuuming was a breeze. There are three different suction levels and it is fairly quite as far as vacuums go.
But the biggest surprise of all was when I pulled out the filter to see what was inside. It was DISGUSTING! I must have collected 3/4 gallon of dirt and dog fur. I swear, I vacuum at least every week and my dogs are tiny cavaliers that don't shed too terribly. I am convinced that most of the dirt and fur I collected was from deep down in the carpet...the stuff that the Kirby clearly didn't pick up.
The other thing I like is that it's really easy to clean the stairs with this canister vac. MUCH easier than lugging a heavy upright vacuum.
One last thing - there's a great hardwood floor attachment and another smaller brush attachment for furniture, crevices, etc. 
I would absolutely recommend this vacuum to anyone, it's fantastic!

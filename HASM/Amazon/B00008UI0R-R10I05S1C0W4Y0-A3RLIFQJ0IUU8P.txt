Title: Not So Good :-(
Content:
I purchased this vacumn 9/2005.  Initally, I absolutely loved it! As time went on I discovered I actually hated it! 1)does not get close enough to walls, etc., for 'edge cleaning'. 2) the filter is an absolute nightmare! It requires constant cleaning if it is to have the suction required to vacumn. The only way to get the damn thing really truly clean is to take it outside and bang it gently for 15 20 minutes on a hard surface and then high pressure hose the filter out which then means 4 to 5 days of drying time!  What a pain in the neck! 3) within the first year there seemed to be an issue with a short of some kind in the handle where you activate the amount of suction (on/off) and turn the power head on/off. Perhaps that is an easy fix for the repair guy, I dunno, I'm replacing it with a dyson animal d17. With 5000 sq feet of house to clean I can't be bothered with taking my vacumn to a repair service. I would NOT recommend this vacumn to anyone. Not impressed with hoover at all.

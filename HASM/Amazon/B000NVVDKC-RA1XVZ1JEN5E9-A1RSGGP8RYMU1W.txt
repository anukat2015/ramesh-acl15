Title: Great camera with plenty of features and room to grow
Content:
I took a long time deciding what camera to get.  Nikon D40x? Pentax K10D? Canon XTi? Sony Alpha A100?  Well, I tried each of them out in a local camera shop after reading a ton of different reviews (DPreviews, SLRgear, etc).  While they're all great cameras and I don't think that you'd make a wrong choice if you you got any of them, the Olympus seemed to offer a couple of things that I loved:
- great image color & detail (although you as a photographer have to be a bit more precise than with the other cameras)
- pretty straightforward button layout to access features and functions quickly
- great dust reduction system
- in-body image stablization
- a comfortable size/weight in my hands
- some truly great lenses
The only negative that I've got for the camera is that there aren't a bunch of low priced fast primes available at this time. While the lenses that are out there are really good, they're on average a bit more expensive than those of the competition.
For the price, the two lens system blows away the competition.  The glass is far better than the kit lenses in any of the competitors.  If you're going to buy the E-510, get the 2 lens kit, you won't be disappointed.

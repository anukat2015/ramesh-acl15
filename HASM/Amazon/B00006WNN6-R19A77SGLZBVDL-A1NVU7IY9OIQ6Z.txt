Title: good for warming up your feet and a small room
Content:
I purchased this product b/c of the generally good reviews written about it.  Because of its size, it takes a while to warm up a small room, but is great for warming up my feet at night when I watch TV.  The fan can be used by itself, but i feel that the fan also dries the air more than one without a fan.  I've never had a portable heater before, so i can't compare its noise level to others, but it's definitely louder than my humidifier.

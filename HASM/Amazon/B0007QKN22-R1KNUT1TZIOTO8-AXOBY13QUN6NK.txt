Title: Expected more from this camera
Content:
After using the Canon A85 Powershot 4.0 megapixel camera for almost a year, I decided to upgrade to a high quality digital camera and chose the Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP.
I was disappointed from the first picture. The autofocus was extremely poor. Virtually every photo taken in a variety of settings, lighting and speeds were soft or blatantly out of focus. The manual focus has no focus guide, either. Other professional photographers also tried their hand at this camera, only to yield the same results.
I've been taking photos for almost 20 years, and have used a variety of digital cameras through friends and associates over the past few years to get an idea of what non-film cameras can produce. This camera caused more disappointment than all the other ones I've tried, combined. I took about 300 pictures, trying every avenue to produce a picture that looked like it was taken by a 8.0 MP semi-professional camera, to no avail. I found that my Canon A85 took consistently sharper images at 4x6 print size when shooting side-by-side.
I returned the Digital Rebel after one week, and the search for a decent digital one continues...

Title: best ipod made to date
Content:
this ipod was a great improvement over my 20GB photo ipod. the internet feature is great and i dont notice any of the problems with the screen that others have mentioned. as well as people calling hte album flow useless, i think its great, its an interesting way to browse your albums and its all i use now. as well as the clock feature is very convienient (my ipod doubles as a watch) so its easy to check to time with it.
realy the only thing i dont like about it is how much they took out to make sure they still sell iphones. it would have been a nice to be able to hve an email program on it but its not too bad, as well as takeing out the feature to add events in the calender makes it kidna worthless.
to sum it all up this ipod is great for people who want a PDA minus the phone and lives up to its ipod name with the music and video section. well worth the money. but if you want more storage then the larger ipod classic is waht you should get.

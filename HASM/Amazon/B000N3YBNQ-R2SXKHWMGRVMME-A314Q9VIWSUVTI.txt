Title: Compact and powerful
Content:
The electrolux is probably even better looking in the flesh than on Amazon. Very powerful, folds into a small space easily. Easier on stairs the a full size vac but needs a longer cord and a suction tube to be a whole house unit. Build quality in quite good, although I hear it is assembled in Mexico. I guess that accounts for the great sale price I got.

Title: lowered my heating costs
Content:
I am extremely happy with my CZ infrared heater.  My home is approximately 900 sq ft, and well insulated.  I live in the pacific northwest, since purchasing my CZ infrared I have seen a decrease in my electric bill of $40-$55 a month compared to using my standard basebord heating.  I am planning to purchase many more for friends and family as we could all use a break in our monthly bills through this tough economic time.

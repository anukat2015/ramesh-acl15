Title: Love It!
Content:
Not only does this unit make a good cup of coffee, but it's also easy to use and, for us, the carafe-less system is perfect and fun!  You can "pour" your first cup within a minute of turning on the machine, without the old "carafe switch" move that we had to use with our regular machine (the lever that allowed you to pour while the coffee was brewing died years ago).  We also love the "auto off" feature, as we had a tendency to leave our old machine on all day.   
We've had no problems with filling the machine, and cleaning it is a breeze.  I wish we'd found a system like this ages ago.  We're completely satisfied!

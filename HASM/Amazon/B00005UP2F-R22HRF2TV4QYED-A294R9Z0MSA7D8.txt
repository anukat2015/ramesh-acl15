Title: Best Vacuum ever
Content:
I purchased the Vision bagless three years ago and it has been the best vacuum cleaner I have ever used.  Along with the other cat owner who has reviewed this machine, I agree that it pulls out every bit of hair my cats leave.  I like this machine so much that I am getting a second one to leave downstairs so I don't have to lug it up and down the stairs.  Yeah, I am lazy, but this machine is worth the investment.

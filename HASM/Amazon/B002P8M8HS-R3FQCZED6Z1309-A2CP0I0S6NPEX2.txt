Title: Idiot-proof
Content:
I received this laptop within one week of ordering it.  I purchased it at $550 and noticed it went up to $580.  I opened the box, turned it on, and have had no problems with it since we received it 2 days ago.  The family loves it.  We are very happy with this purchase.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the battery life of the laptop.  However, we will primarily use it indoors where there are outlets so I tend to always have it plugged in anyway.

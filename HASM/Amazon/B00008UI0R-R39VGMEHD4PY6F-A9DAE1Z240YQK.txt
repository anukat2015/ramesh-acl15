Title: Fills up fast...because it works!
Content:
Wonderful vaccuum, especially for the price.  The dirt trap does fill up quick...it's supposed to, that means it's working.  If it fills up to fast perhaps you should cleam more often.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  It made the CR Pick in CR Mag.  Great Vac!

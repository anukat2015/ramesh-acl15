Title: Best little vacuum!
Content:
This is the best little vacuum I ever used I have 12 cats and 5 dogs and you talk about hair!  Well the Breeze sucks it all up great in corners where hairs tend to linger.  I was tired of lugging a heavy Hoover canister around and spending money on bags.  I love this vacuum couldn't be happier.

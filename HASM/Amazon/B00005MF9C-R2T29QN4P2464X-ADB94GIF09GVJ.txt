Title: When You Only Need One Cup...
Content:
I have been using this coffee maker for 5 months. I only drink one cup of coffee in a day and my wife doesn't drink coffee at all so it is perfect for my needs. It brews coffee quick and the 15oz. size is perfect. My only complaint would be that if you are in a hurry to get your coffee the maker continues to drip. This wouldn't be a problem with some sort of reservoir under the cup. To solve this problem, just be patient. The price was right to. I love it.

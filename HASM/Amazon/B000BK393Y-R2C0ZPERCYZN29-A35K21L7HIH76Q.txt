Title: YOU GOT IT THIS TIME OLYMPUS!
Content:
I have been a long time Olympus Fan! Back in early March 05 I purchased one of the first EVOLT E300's, WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! I hated that SLR! It replaced my C8080 Widezoom. I then purchased the NEW CANON DIGITAL REBEX XT, AWSOME!!!! What an investment that turned out to be. Purchased many options and after all said and done I invested nearly $3000.00. Don't get me wrong I received a lot of punch for what I purchased, EFs 10-22m Lens, EF-s 17-85mm IS Lens, EF 75-300mm Lens, 580EX Speedlite Flash ECT ECT ECT, Got it with the Kit Lens also,....I love all of it! But now I gave Olympus another try,I purchased the EVOLT E500 and it KICKS THE REBEL XT's BUTT! I can't give enough PRAISE to Olympus for the product they have put out here. The EVOLT E500 gives more than what you deserve for the purchase price of UNDER $900.00 at most places for the kit that includes both lens! You won't be disappointed in this set up AWSOME!!!!!

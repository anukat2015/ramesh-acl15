Title: Battery Troubles
Content:
Even on a full charge the battery will only last for about 15 minutes.  It works good for those 15 minutes.  Solid sucking action and great portability, but only for about 15 minutes.  Then you have to charge the battery for about 4 hours to get another 15 minutes.  Apparently this model is also off the market so replacements are impossible to come by and the manufacturer is no help.  I'd say avoid this manufacturer.

Title: Best Nikon for the dollar
Content:
I own the D80 and D40 and love them both.  The D90 is just an outstanding camera in so many ways.  What I like the most about this camera is the ease of use.  It is by far the easiest camera in the Nikon line yet.  The large LCD screen allows me to see exactly what I am doing at all times.  For me, over 40 years old, I have a hard time seeing the small top mounted LCD so I love this large one in back.  The navigation is so well done and you can navigate all your important settings with a few simple clicks.  As for the actual photos....it's a Nikon - so they are great!  My only word of caution is to beware of the high ISO capability of this camera.  At 3200 ISO I personally do not like the quality of my indoor low light photos of people.  The colors are very harsh.  So I set it to a max of 1600 when I'm shooting people and I get much better looking images.  Other than that it is a great camera.  In all honesty the D40 takes just as good of pictures, but the D90 is more fun to use.  So if you love your gadgets get this camera you won't be sorry.  If money is a primary concern, then go with the D40; it's a great low cost camera -for $550 with two kitted lenses you can't go wrong.  If you are eying a D80, then get the D90 instead as it is well worth the extra money.

Title: Bosch rates higher than Dyson in my book!
Content:
I bought my first Bosch vacuum about a year and a half ago. By far, it picked up more dirt than the Dyson or any other vacuum I have ever owned.  It lasted through the last 8 months of a remodel to my home and my contractors using it on all sorts of dust and rubble! I just bought a second one to keep on the first floor! It definitly gets a THUMBS UP by me!

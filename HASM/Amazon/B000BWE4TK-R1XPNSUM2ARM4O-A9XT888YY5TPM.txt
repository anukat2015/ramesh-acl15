Title: Good for beginners

The D50 is the newest rung in Nikon's ladder of digital DLR cameras. Compared to the competition (which you can read about all you want on the wider web), it offers an excellent feature set at an excellent price point. If low cost was your only concern, you can't really go wrong with the D50. It is an excellent camera, but make no mistake, it is not as capable as Nikon's other offerings. It is also worth remembering that no camera will take pictures for you; you can take astounding pictures with any camera, either astoundingly good, or astoundingly bad. The important feature of any camera is that your camera does not get in the way of your photography, but again, it is your photography, not the camera, that takes good pictures.
If you are shopping for a D50, I strongly encourage you to consider the D70: it has more features and the same basic usability as the D50, and the cost is pretty much the same. The D70s is more expensive, but has a couple of newer features than the D70; as far as taking pictures goes, the D70 and D70s are pretty much the same camera.
Why the D70? Two main reasons. One is the kit lens (18-70mm) that comes with the D70 kit package. The 18-55mm lens that ships with the D50 kit is a lower-end lens (note that I'm not calling it a bad lens), but the 18-70 lens that comes in the D70 kit is an excellent lens. You may quickly feel limited by the D50 kit lens, but the D70 kit lens is good enough that you would not feel ashamed if you were using it on Nikon's flagship camera, the D2x.
The second reason to go with the D70 is that it leaves more doors open if you want to upgrade later on. It supports more of the high-end functions of the more expensive Nikon digital SLRs (such as the wireless flash capabilities of Nikon's iTTL system), and it uses CompactFlash memory cards-- if you do decide to upgrade, you won't have to buy a whole new set of memory cards. The memory card business is a minor consideration, but if you're a starving artist trying to scrimp together the money to upgrade, a couple hundred bucks can make a difference. After all, that's part of why you're looking at the D50, right?
Think of the extra $50-100 you spend on a D70 as an investment in your new hobby. It's not as important if you plan on buying a new camera body every year, but for those of us that plan on using the camera for several years, the versatility is more than worth the price.

Title: good product
Content:
Makes a good cup of coffee. However, for me it needs to be hotter. So I microwave it. I bought this because it was the same as the one I had. The only difference was the water basket. The new one has a much smaller opening to pour the water in. So you have to have good aim to get all the water in. Otherwise some of the water never makes it in.

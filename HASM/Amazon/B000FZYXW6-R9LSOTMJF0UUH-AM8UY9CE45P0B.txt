Title: A terrible waste of money!!!
Content:
I've had one for a couple of months, and am VERY disappointed with it.  It puts out cool air, but definitely not cold air...  Consequently, at best, it can get my bedroom down 10-15 degrees in temp, after several hours of running full blast.  (Note that I quickly gave up trying to use it in my livingroom, where it would make almost no detectable change in room temp...)
A MUCH better choice I think would be to go with a std window unit (albeit it would be more difficult to install).  It would work much better, and be much less expensive as well!!!

Title: Unpredictable quirk
Content:
I love the machine except for one thing. About 1 out of 5 times it does not automatically refill for the next cup. If you shut it off for about 10 minutes, it's fine for the next one or few cups.
Since I only have one or two cups in the AM, I can live with it for now. I'll wait til near the end of the warranty or if it gets worse to return it.

Title: Awesome heater!
Content:
We bought this heater for our baby's room as we like to keep our house cold at night.  It is great!  We set the thermostat and it keeps the room at the correct temp.  It is very quiet- (Our old space heater would kick on in the middle of the night and it would wake her up) and it heats the room quickly.  
This is the third space heater I have bought, and I think it will be my last- we have no complaints.

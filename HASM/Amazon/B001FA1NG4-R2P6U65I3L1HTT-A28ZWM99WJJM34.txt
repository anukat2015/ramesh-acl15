Title: Great Slightly older model
Content:
Bought it because the 5G came out and amazon has a great deal on the 4G. love all the new features, only issue is many of the radios / speakers that charge all the other ipods now say charging not supported on this accessory.  The usb charger works and my wall chargers so I don't know what apple did with this.  It is my only complaint. (this replaced an older - probably 1G or 2G nano)

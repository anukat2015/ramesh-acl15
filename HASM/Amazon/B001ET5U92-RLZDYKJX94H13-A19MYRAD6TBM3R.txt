Title: Awesome Camera!
Content:
I have used Nikon SLR's for 30 years with my last one being a F5.  In recent years I've used a number of "point and shoot" digitals including the Nikon swivel bodied CoolPIX 950 and 4500. The way technology changes so quickly I couldn't see spending the money on a D3.  When the D90 dropped to 799.00 I jumped on it. I'm taking pro quality photos again.  The D90 is AWESOME!  I just bought the body and am using the 35-70 2.8 and 80-200 2.8 lenses I use on my F5.  The weight of the lens gives the D90 a feel similar to my F5.  The more I use it the more I love it.  What a great value!

Title: Lakewood? Driftwood to me.
Content:
Was expecting a well made radiant heater but got junk. The heater overheats and shuts down within twenty minutes. Room temp in the 60's and nothing near the heater and it just shuts off. 
Corporations:Stop shipping all jobs (including design and engineering) overseas to profit a few. Companies like this make products cheaper each year until it's worthless. "Make it cheaper to make more money for stockholders. Do it again. Do it again. Oh, it's so cheap it doesn't work? Hmmm."

Title: Works great
Content:
My office cube is so cold I needed a heater to keep from freezing. Wanted something small and with little noise.  This heater is perfect.  It works great, really puts out the heat. I keep it on the low setting, otherwise it gets too warm, so it can  heat a much larger space.  I highly recommend it.

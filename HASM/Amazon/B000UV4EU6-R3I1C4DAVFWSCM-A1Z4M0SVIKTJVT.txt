Title: Great product for the price but with several shortcomings
Content:
I bought the Zen 4gb almost two weeks ago and I've enjoyed using it for music, video and pictures. For the price, it's a steal, especially with an additional SD card.
Unfortunately, a few days ago, the on/off switch broke. It somehow got pushed towards the internal part of the player and I'm unable to "pop" it back out. Makes the Zen seem kind of cheap. I had a few other griped. 
*It's not easy to navigate the media library using only one hand (even worse if you're left-handed).
*It's also a challenge to navigate the media library in the dark (e.g. in bed before going to sleep)
*The software is terrible in comparison to iTunes. You have to use different programs to convert and add podcasts
*I found no easy way to add a playlist (.m3u) to the Zen. I found that Winamp could do this after installing the portable media support plugin.
*only certain divx, wmv video files work and there's not a huge selection on the Internet, as opposed to the iPod.

Title: This One's A Winner
Content:
The failure of our KitchenAid coffee maker after 16 months of use and than being told by the KitchenAid people that it was unrepairable we decided to look for a product that came with a warranty that would make the purchase price and life of the product a positive feature.  We found it in the Cuisinart ll00R CoffeeMaker...The styling and features exceeded what our old coffeemaker had. My wife particularly likes the programmable turnoff feature which allows her to set the turnoff time later than most coffeemakers. Hopefully the unit will outlast the three year warranty and continue to perform indifinitely.

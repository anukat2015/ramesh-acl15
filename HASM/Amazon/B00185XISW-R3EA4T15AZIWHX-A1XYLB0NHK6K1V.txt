Title: Not enough information...
Content:
I purchased an eco-heater for a renovation project we are doing at our house.  I was about ready to install the product and read through the instructions included in the package which indicate that this product is not to be used in a bathroom area.  Not only that, but I installed the outlet for the unit to be located behind the panel so that the cord would be out of sight.  According to the instructions, this is also not permitted.  
I did a lot of research on the Eco-Heat website before I purchased the product and no-where on the website does it state that the product cannot be used in wet areas or that the plug has to be exposed.  As a matter of fact, none of the pictures and graphics on thier website (or any website for that matter) show a cord coming from the unit.  I'm a pretty handy guy and wired/plumbed my whole new kitchen, so I know my way around electrical appliances.  This...so far...is not making me happy.  I'm trying to contact Eco-Heat to find out if I can use this thing at all.  Stay tuned...

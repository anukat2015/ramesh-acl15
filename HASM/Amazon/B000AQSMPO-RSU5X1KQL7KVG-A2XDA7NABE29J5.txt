Title: Best invention ever
Content:
I love coffee but I only drink a cup a day so this was the perfect solution for me. If I consider all the coffee I normally throw away I think the price would probably be similar to K-cups. These machines allow you to make a variety for guests and yourself without making an entire pot of one kind. I love this so much I bought one for my office as well.
Pros:
Built well, fast brewing
Cons:
Too many varieties
No cleanup
Too convenient

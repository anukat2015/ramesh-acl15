Title: LOVE my Macbook!
Content:
My macbook is one of the best purchases I have ever made! I was transferring files between my old Sony laptop and the new macbook pro and looking at the two side by side. The difference is incredible! I totally regret not making the switch from Windows to Mac earlier! My Sony took about 5-8 min to start up, my Macbook Pro 2 sec (with sleep mode) about 10 sec with the computer totally shut down. The only thing is, the battery is not exactly what Apple advertised (7 hrs). I get about 5 hrs max and around 3 hrs if I am watching movies and/or video.

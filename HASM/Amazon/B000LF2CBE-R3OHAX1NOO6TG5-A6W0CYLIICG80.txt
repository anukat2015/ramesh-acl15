Title: Unbelievable! Never would have guessed...
Content:
this little guy could do as much as it does.
When I first plugged it in, I thought I had been duped by the 'Stanley' name and rugged-look for the design. There was very little noise or air movement. I figured I was going to have to return it the next day.
Good thing I decided to leave it plugged in overnight and see if there was any hope. 
In -30 degree (That's negative 30 for all of you below the tundra of North Dakota) weather outside, this guy heated a one-car garage with 12 foot ceilings to a good 30degrees above zero (60 degrees in less than 14 hours). I just about fell over! I could not believe the job it had done!
I have only had the unit for 5 days now. It has run pretty constant and the unit is very cool to the touch. I do not know how this thing does what it does; but, I am thoroughly impressed!!
So, if you need a 120 volt, plug-in heater to get you out of the house and working in the garage - this is your guy. 
Simply, unbelievable!

Title: Great but could have been a little better
Content:
The Good 
1.The new Ipod mini has made one major improvement over its predecessor i.e. a battery life of 18 hrs or more. My 4GB lasted for 22 hrs on the first go. 
2.The looks are the best coz of the sleek anodized case. 
3.Easy to use,Click wheel Navigation features are unbeatable.
4.Easy to use iTunes software and music downloads.
5.For students you can get this on the apple store for $179 and the 6gb for $229. 
6.Good Customer Service
7.Anti-Shock memory good for those of us who drop things :D
The Bad 
1. The sound quality is not the best, PC World compared it to headphones quality while comparing the iRiver and Creative products to listening room quality. However for normal listeners this should not be a reason to say no to ipod. 
2. It cannot play WMA tracks so it can store only half the number of songs that a wma player can for the same capacity.
3.Doesn't come with the wall charger now that the price is reduced
The Ugly 
1. The ipods have to be returned to Apple to replace the battery which normally will run out in 6-12 months depending on use, that costs $99 besides shipping not to mention the waiting...it would have made more sense to produce them with replacable LiOn batteries. 
My suggestion
I would suggest getting creative's zen micro..
The zen micros also have better sound quality as compared to the pods and around the same price and come with replaceable batteries and can play wmas.
 
But if want great looks and not bothered by less than perfect sound quality stick to the ipod mini.

Title: Love this Camera
Content:
I ordered this camera for the pending arrival of our first child. I also ordered the complementary 50mm lens so I could get good close up photos. Although I am no expert, I have the camera set to "P" and put it to Portrait setting with a high ISO which has allowed us to take awesome pictures of our little one, especially in low light without the need for a flash. I loved being able to just set this camera and point & shoot. My mother and husband are perfectly comfortable using it, especially with the 50mm lens - you don't need to zoom and you get great shots every time.

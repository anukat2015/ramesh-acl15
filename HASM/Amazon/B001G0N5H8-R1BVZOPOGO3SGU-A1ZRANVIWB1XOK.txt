Title: Casio Exilim EX-FH20 9.1MP and real failure
Content:
This may be one of the most disappointing products I have ever purchased.  Yes it will take forty frames a second but the picture quality is very low, very grainy-- likewise, the video requires so much light that only daytime, outside or highly artificial lighting is workable.  
The ability to switch between 30fps and 210fps is a lot of fun and a very nice feature.  However, alongside all the weaknesses of the camera I was very upset that I spent the money.  Camera may be worth about $200 but certainly not a $500-$600 price point camera.
PEACE

Title: DO NOT buy this product
Content:
I feel sorry for the writers of glowing reviews here-- because this product worked well for me too-- for a very short amount of time.
First winter-- near silent operation mounted on the wall.  Quiet, that is, unless we used the "high" setting.  On "high," the heater made loud and somewhat disturbing popping noises.
Second winter-- loud popping noises even on low!  And in the dark, those pops were accompanied by disturbing "spark" like orange glows on the mica panel.  We had to discontinue use-- the child who slept in the room would wake up and cry when the heater cycled on.  And the increasing visible spark-like lighting made me too nervous to leave it on, since that effect is not described anywhere in the product's documentation.
Third winter-- it worked for about two hours, and then died.  For good.
Save your money.  Buy a product reviewed positively by someone who has owned it for more than a month!

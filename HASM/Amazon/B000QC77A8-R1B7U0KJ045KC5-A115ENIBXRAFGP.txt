Title: Great for large bedroom
Content:
I bought this unit over a year ago and still love it.  I have a large bedroom and it will warm the entire room 5-8 degrees in less than 30 minutes.  We tried 4 or 5 other heaters before landing on this - it is fairly quiet, while it does not provide tip-over protection, it is very stable when placed next to a wall even on thick carpet.  Considering buying another for other rooms in the house!

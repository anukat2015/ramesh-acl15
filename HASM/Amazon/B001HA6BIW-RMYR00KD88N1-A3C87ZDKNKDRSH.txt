Title: Don't waste your money on this model or this brand
Content:
Holmes products are terrible.  This is the second Holmes product I have owned.  This heater worked fine for 3 months.  We boxed it put it in storage and 6 months later tried to use it and it was DEAD (within warranty).
  We tried to get it replaced and the people from Holmes made us wait 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months (4 different phone calls).  Each time was a different excuse ('Your model is not in stock', 'We are out of that model', etc.)  Finally, they agreed to replace it, but made us pay $10 shipping.  $10 !  The original unit was only $50.
  Long story, short.  The product isn't that great and the replacement policy just isn't there.  Try a different brand.

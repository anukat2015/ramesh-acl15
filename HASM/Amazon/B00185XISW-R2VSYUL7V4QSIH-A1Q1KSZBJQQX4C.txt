Title: Does Not work
Content:
WARNING - READY THE RETURN POLICY FIRST....
Returning mine today, which according to the return policy, will cost me 20% restocking fee and I have to pay the return shipping.
This heater didn't even heat a small bedroom (12 x 12).  After 6 hours, the temp dropped in the room from 69deg (with old electric heater) to 53deg with the ECO-heater.
The flat panel was hot to the touch, so I guess it's a good hand warmer, although a pair of gloves would be cheaper.
Bottom Line:  Not a space heater and not worth the money.

Title: Excellent !
Content:
This beats oil filled heaters, ceramic heaters, and any others.
First because its efficiency. It runs in two modes 400w and 800w.
Which are a lot less than usually 1000w space heaters. at 400w i am
very comfortable. 
second, I LOVE THE LIGHT. 
there are studies where people get depressed living in dark regions
or seasonal changes. This thing give you kind of sun-like beam
and is very toasty and comfortable enough for me to go day dream. 
very relaxing.
People think since it's halogen life span of the heater won't be more very long. However, upon close inspection the coil of the halgen is very
thick. It's not like halogen lamp that you use for lighting purposes.
It will last minimum 3 to 5 years if you are careful with it and don't shake it or move it around.

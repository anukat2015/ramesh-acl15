Title: Rookie
Content:
Got this camera a month ago, maybe 1000 pictures, to replace a few different point and shoots. My wife used to use a Canon 35mm and my sister has a Digitial Canon, not sure which model. I was determined to buy a Canon. Read all of the reviews and had my mind made up. Went to the store and was able to handle both cameras for about a half an hour. Nikon had me from that minute. I really love this camera. Feels great, easy controls, good build quality, lots of options. I have a baby due soon and was tired of missing shots with spotty point and shoots. I am a rookie and I am still learning how to use this thing but so far so good. My friends have all asked if I got a new camera because I instantly started to taking better pictures. No, I'm not quitting my day job. The software that came with the camera was weak. I will have to invest in Elements or something.
I am sure all the experts can tell you why "x" is so much better than "y" but I'm telling you, as an average joe, if you want to get an entry level DSLR with more than just basic features, then you can't go wrong with the D5000.

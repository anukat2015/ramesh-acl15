Title: Amazing Laptop!!!! Fast & affordable!!!
Content:
Upgrade this from my Toshiba. For $700 it got 4GB ram & 320GB hard drive. very sharp design and portable.  
Very happey with it so far. I needed a fast computer, and this laptop is so fast. Windows 7 is great too. 
I got it for $700 from Amazon and I think it is worth the price. I think it was the best deal.

Title: GREAT COFFEE MAKER
Content:
I have had my Keurig B77 now for a couple of weeks and I just LOVE it. Even my husband who was very skeptical really likes it. He uses his own coffee with the reusable filter whereas I like to try the different K-cups but either way it makes a great cup of coffee. Not only is this coffeemaker attractive looking but it is so EASY to use. It is quiet and hardly any cleanup. I did buy it at Costco and saved $20. I can highly recommend this coffeemaker.

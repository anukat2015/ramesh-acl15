Title: Damaged Goods
Content:
The heater was a lot smaller than I expected, both in overall dimensions and wattage. I knew that it was a 1325 watt heater, but I found out that it was totally inefficient as a room heater. The heater's sheetmetal was also damaged. There was a large dinge on the top.  I returned the heater with no problem on the return and my credit card received the proper credit

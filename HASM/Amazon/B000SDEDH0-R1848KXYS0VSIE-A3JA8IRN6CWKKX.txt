Title: Abysmal Product and Service
Content:
If you are looking for a portable air conditioner/heat pump avoid this product and manufacturer. While the unit is satisfactory when running, once any problems develop that require service outside the warranty period, you may as well junk it. My unit lasted just 14 months and developed a leak that ruined my floor. Considering that I only used the air conditioning function during the summer, it only lasted one cooling season. 
There is no local service network to fix even the most minor problem. I suppose that you could ship the unit back as was suggested by Soleusair for repair, but have you ever struggled with boxing and shipping a large unit that weighs 50 or 60 pounds, to say nothing about the premium shipping and repair cost. It is cheaply made and unreliable

Title: It Really Improves the Taste
Content:
I got the Cuisinart Stainless Steel 12 cup Coffee Maker for Christmas and was very surprised to find that it actually improved the taste of my coffee. The change in taste is subtle, but I would say it is richer and smoother. The coffee maker is very attractive to look at, well made, and offers some welcome features: for example the auto on, and especially the auto off feature, and the choice of carafe temperature. I went ahead and got the Cuisinart  GTF Gold Tone Filter. A great present for yourself or someone else.

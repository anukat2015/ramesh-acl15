Title: Great Product!!!
Content:
I bought this product in March to use for downhill skiing.  I love the armband that comes with it.  The one battery lasts forever and I don't have to worry about recharging it and waiting.  I have never downloaded music and the program was simple to understand and easy to use.  My seven year old daughter love this too.  I have no complaints about this product and would highly recommend this to anyone.  In fact I am planning to buy another one.  I have used it biking, skiing, mowing the lawn, and boating with not a single problem.  And I am rough on equipment. This is a must have!!!

Title: Good So Far....
Content:
I had a Creative Muvo N200 that was great until it crapped out - I'm hoping this one lasts longer.
So far I'm impressed with the functionality.  I researched long and hard to try to find a player that was small, compatible with Audible, compatible with Netplayer, and had bookmarks.  This player does it all, and the bookmarks are a necessity for netplayer and audible content.
The interface is nice and fairly easy to use.  The included earplugs are surprisingly comfy.  If it holds up it should be a winner.
One dissappointment - I have a Motorola RAZR phone and saw on-line a adapter that claimed to charge both the RAZR and the Zen V.  I figured the Motorola version that I have for both plug-in and car would work, but neither do.  Chargers are getting too smart for their own good I suppose, so for now I am stuck with the USB charger,which I really don't like....

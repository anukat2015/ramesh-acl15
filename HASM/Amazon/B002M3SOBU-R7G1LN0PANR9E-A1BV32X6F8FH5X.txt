Title: IPod Touch review by Lou
Content:
I am having a lot of fun with the games. It has helped me to do a better job of keeping my contact list and calendar up to date with the two way syncing. It is nice to have the option of reading my Kindle on the ipod available. I primarily purchased the touch so I could easily show people my photos and to check my email while traveling. I have been happy with both of these features and checking email will become even easier as wifi becomes more common.

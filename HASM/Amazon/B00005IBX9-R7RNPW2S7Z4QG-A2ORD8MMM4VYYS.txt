Title: Great Overall - Some Inconveniences
Content:
Could this machine require time to break in?  Makes no sense, but I am finding that I am really enjoying my coffee after an initial period of not being sure.  Great looking machine, good piping hot brew, well designed ergomic carafe.  Here are my gripes.  Adding water from the carafe is an extra step (if using bottled water) since there is no external water level indicator.  The water receptacle is small and needs to be filled with my left hand in order to get the best angle.  The carafe needs to be twisted and turned to get the last bit of water out.  Plus, given that the unit is black, it is hard to see where you need to pour.  Another poster suggested removing the filter basket to load the coffee.  That is a good idea and works well now that I found the right mug to hold the basket upright and steady.  Adding grounds outside the machine keeps strays from entering the water receptacle and keeps the top area cleaner.  The fingerprint issue has been discussed here in other posts.  I've used Krups machines in the past and have been happy with them although eventually the white discolors badly.  I wanted a black coffee maker with stainless steel.  This is just what I was looking for!

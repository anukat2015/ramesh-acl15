Title: Good, but not quite great
Content:
Well, to start off, I'm not going to say I regret buying this computer, but I think it could be a bit better. That being said, they did a LOT right with this computer as well. This is my review after a little less than two months of review
Pros:
- Lightweight. Perfect companion for a college student (one that takes studying seriously that is and does not use their laptop for nothing but games and watching videos (will get to this later))
- Runs well, good multitasker 
- Thin, yet again making it nice for a student, or anyone on the go who needs their computer with them
- Battery life is great. There have been a lot of people on here questioning the battery life, and no, it does not get 12 hours of life. However, even though I have not actually timed how long the battery lasts, I am confident it can give 7-8 hours on a normal basis. Besides, who really needs a laptop to last them for 12 hours? You take it out with you, use it for maybe 6 hours at the most, and bring it home and charge it there.
- LOVE the keyboard. Probably my favorite part of the computer.
Cons:
- Don't think I'll ever come to love the mousepad. The right click and left click buttons are HORRENDOUS. I can never tell whether my fingers are on them or not when I'm not looking at them. The multitouch isn't great either (thought it had zoom in and zoom out... still haven't figured those out yet)
- Streaming videos. Yes, I know this is something that is discussed in many reviews, but I'm still disappointed in it. However, streaming videos that are not too heavy in the quality department should be fine, and viewing videos that are stored on your hard drive is no problem.
- The thing I hate the most is the finger print magnet aspect. If you're like me, in that half of the experience of any gadget is the sexiness of the gadget, this computer will drive you nuts. Yes, this is an attractive computer when it's clean, but get a whole bunch of smudges on it, and, if you're like me, you'll be driven nuts.
Like I said already, this computer isn't a messiah by any means, but at the same, I don't have buyers remorse either. If this were running Vista, however, this might be a different story...

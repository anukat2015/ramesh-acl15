Title: Electolux Harmony
Content:
I recieved this very quickly and used this for a few months now. 
The main hose came crushed in one spot which does not effect the use. 
The outside of the box was not damaged so the quality control at this facilty is lacking. 
The directions are disappointing considering the price of this unit. 
It is quiet and did very well on my hardwood.  I used this under the bed right away and it sucked the dust right up. 
This does not do well on flimsy/throw rugs and I had to drag my other vaccum out of the closet. 
I do think the filtration system has worked wonders, it blows up instead of on the side, it doesn't end up blowing your dirt everywhere. I feel the air is truly more filtered, I don't smell any foul odors when it's turned on.

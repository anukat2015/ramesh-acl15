Title: Canon XT (350D) Review
Content:
This was my first DSLR and a very good choice at that.It has numerous features,alot like the higher class Canon cameras.Like alot of reviews I write I often start with the bad,because when I was researching this camera and others,thats what I wanted to hear first.So thats where Ill start with this one.
Cons:
Even though I wouldnt say I have huge hands it still felt small in them.If you happen to have smaller hands,male of female,then this wouldnt be a problem.Its more of a preference than it is a knock against the quality of it.I just feel it should still be mentioned.And with that said,you will often find little white fingernail scuff marks on the inside right part of the lens housing,next to the grip.I have heard others complain about the size and awkwardness of the grip and in my opinion that was very trivial.If youre looking for complaints about body and design,much can be said about every camera out there,so to me,I was more interested in the performance.But if you do worry about the design of it,then I will add that it is made of a type of plastic,rather than a alloy like the other higher end Canon cameras are,which again to me,trivial but can be noticed when compared.Back to performance,it is a tad slow on the focusing.Another obstacle I noticed was when taking spontanious pictures often it would go into the self timer due to me accidently pressing one of the buttons and changing the setting.Im not sure I credit that to the size of the body or the simplistic way of altering a feature.Then there is the sensor size.Some will say full frame is better,others swear by cropped sensors.It really all depends on what you want to shoot.Cropped sensors definately have thier place in the world of photography.This camera along with alot of Canon dslr cameras has a sensor crop of 1.6x.Also not the ideal camera for fast action captures.You can time it right and get a great pic,but the slower frame rate per second is somewhat a dilema,especially when filming birds or shooting a sequence of a race car rounding a corner or quaterback throwing a football.The 7 points of focus are adequate but not always enough.There is not a spot metering feature on this camera,but there is a partial metering which is not as bad as some may think.Very much a plus when taking a portrait with alot of backlight.Another 'quark' is that the viewfinder is rather small,which when I started,forced me to use the lcd screen to set exposure and composition,which is not ideal.I now use it to read the histogram,after doing so then Ill adjust accordingly.Just another feature I found useful after learning over time about photography.
Pros:
The 8mp is plenty for blwoing up prints.If you plan on blowing them up over 16x20 then I could see where the quality of the picture would decline,SLIGHTLY.But for sizes up to that it is very detailed and crisp.The auto mode will most likely be the best place to start.The camera will adjust the settings according to what youre pointing at.Essentially a point and shoot camera,when in this mode.Then you have the other modes such as portraits,landscapes,macro,etc etc that are designed for their designated purposes.Very handy and a great learning tool for the more hands-on modes such as aperture(AV),shutter speed(TV),etc etc.The Program mode is where you can learn about exposure,the camera will evaluate,set the shutterspeed and aperture and you will be able to alter the exposure and flash output.Very very handy when learning.As for the AV,TV,M modes,those are the ultra self adjusting features,the possibilities are almost endless when you grasp these modes.The wide range of lenses you can buy,EF or EF-S,are a definate plus for this camera.From the ultra wide to the super zoom.Theyll work with this camera.Why people have opted to go for the XTi over the XT is personal preference.Remember it does not change the quality of the image taken.The colors and detail in the pictures from this camera are top notch,much like alot of Canon cameras.The weight of this camera is very comfortable,again something some people take into consideration when buying,personally it didnt have any bearing on my decision,but thought it should be mentioned.This is also a fantastic camera for portraits and landscapes.
Final Words:
This is a beautiful camera that produces beautiful captures.A must have for any beginner dslr'er out there.A great learning tool as well.I have graduated to from a 4mp pocket camera,to a 6mp dslr-like Powershot S3,and I am now at this camera.I have used this camera and have gained knowledge about photography from this camera.Ive heard,and will agree,that this is a great camera to eventually figure out what kind of photography you want to do,whether it be weddings,landscapes,portraits or fast action,high speed.I have discovered that I want to venture into fast action,such as sports.Therefore this camera wouldnt be the top choice,that would be the 1D Mark II N.But again,I feel this camera has taught me enough about different styles and purposes of the camera bodies out there,which has in turned guided me to which style I want to pursue.And if youre wondering why I didnt opt for the XTi,its wasnt because it was higher it was because I felt this would be able to teach me the basics of the technical side to photography.Im not one to buy into the whole more mega pixel always means better pictures.Under most circumstance it really is irrelevant and if I were to present to you well taken photos from the XTi(10mp) and the XT(8mp),Im safe in saying I would bet that you couldnt tell the difference.It comes down to the photographer that decides what a photo will look like.Every camera can take poor,bad quality pictures if the person behind the viewfinder isnt well edjucated about the technical side of photography.Thus why I think this camera is a tool used for that purpose,to edjucate.If you get this camera you wont be sorry,a very very nice camera.If you are more concerned about looks and the feel of a camera than I suppose you can opt for the XTi,not a bad choice,very nice indeed,but not a large enough improvement for me to upgrade to it.
So have fun with photography,it can get in your blood,and see you down the road.

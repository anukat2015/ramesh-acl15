Title: Buy this One !!!
Content:
I have never written a review in my life, but for this product I have to. I had been looking for the "perfect" coffee maker, I wanted it to be fast, hot, and smooth. I wanted a stainless thermal carafe with staying power and a large capacity. Well,. . . I found it !!!
This coffee maker is fast, the coffee is hot and smooth. The thermal carafe holds plenty, and I just had some, 2 1/2 hours old, still hot ( with cold 1/2 & 1/2 added )!!!
There is no spilling when you pour, and no overflow when you brew. Because of the higher brew temperature, my coffee has more flavor with the same amount of coffee that I normally use.
I bought a universal #4 Gold Filter at Williams Sonoma, it fits perfectly.
There was a small problem with the shipping, not Amazon's fault, but Amazon adjucated it quickly and fairly.
In conclusion, buy this coffee maker, and buy it from Amazon.
5 Stars for both !!!

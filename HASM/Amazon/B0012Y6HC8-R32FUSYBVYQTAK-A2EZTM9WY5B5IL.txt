Title: Very nice camera
Content:
I've owned a Rebel XT for a few years, so bought this camera to upgrade. It's easy to use and if it's anything like the Rebel XT, it will be very reliable. The shutter is responsive. I get live view mode as well as viewfinder shooting. The big LCD screen is very nice. I didn't go through every feature, as most of them I will never use. Moreover, the menu is easy to navigate, and one doesn't get overwhelmed by buttons on the camera. (I also have Nikon equipment.) I give it 5 stars.

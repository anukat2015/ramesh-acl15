Title: Great laptop for the money!
Content:
We've had it for a couple weeks now.  Purchased it for both business use, and media .  So far, absolutely no complaints.  It's super fast, the picture is amazing - really clear.  The sound is excellent, and gets way louder than any other computer I've used w/out any distortion.  The touch pad is very user freindly, and having the 10 key is a huge bonus for business use.  Windows 7 is much easier to network than Vista.

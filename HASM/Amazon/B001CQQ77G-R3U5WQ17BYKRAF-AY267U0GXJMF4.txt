Title: So good, I now have 4 of these
Content:
I bought one of these to heat my NH house in the early Spring to late Fall, was quite please and ordered 3 more. I turned two of them on this weekend (overnight temps in high 30's/low 40's...daytime temps in mid to low 60's). I had 2 running (my house is insulated) and it actually made the house quite warm. I left one on overnight and it kept the house comfortable.
I also bought the "WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat" to operate these. They are supposed to allow you to control the temperature more accurately...though I have not used the Programmable Outlet Thermostats yet.WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat

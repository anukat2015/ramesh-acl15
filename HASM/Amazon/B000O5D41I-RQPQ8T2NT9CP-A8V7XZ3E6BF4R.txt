Title: OK Laptop but horrific support
Content:
Just got the laptop in. Had to re-image the system.  I'm not much for all the adds and junk.  Good luck on getting drivers.  I needed to move over to a 64 bit O/S and HP just can't get the ftp site operational.  Basically that laptop is just a waste of power until I can get the drivers, so off hunting the internal component drivers from vendors.  Last time I'll buy something like this from HP.  Stick to printers and save the install disks.

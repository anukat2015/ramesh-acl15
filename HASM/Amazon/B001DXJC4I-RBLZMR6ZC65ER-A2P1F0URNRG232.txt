Title: Horrible Unit
Content:
The item is heavy, but was easy to install and came with some extra's.  It was not noisy and it did roll around fine.  Their patented drip free technology was not what it claimed to be.  We had the air conditioner on by the window and it did take maybe a day and a half to cool the house down to the temperature indicated on the unit.  The item said it was dripless and that the pan would have to be emptied once per season before storage.  Seeing as how we only had it on for two days, then used the remote to turn it off, we never noticed that the machine flooded our carpets (it was placed in a non-traffic area of our living room and with the remote, you never really have to go near the machine (we have a large living room.  It wasn't until we smelled the stink of wet carpet did we walk around to see where it was coming from.  The floors were sloshy.  It was horrible.  We had to pull all the carpeting and foam out and have it all replaced.  The retailer took it back and said that the same thing happened to him and from what I found out later today, the same thing happened to a lot of people.  Now, I am looking for another machine, this one is definitely not for us.

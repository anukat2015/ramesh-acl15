Title: Great Upgrade from a Point and Shoot
Content:
I still have the SD200 I bought a year or two ago, but the XTI is great.  I am still learning all the settings.  Now I'm starting to play with the RAW and continous shooting modes.  I can't wait until nature starts getting it's color back to go shooting in some of the parks around town.  A friend of mine has an XT and his photos from last summer look great, I can't imagine what the XTI's will look like.
All I can say is buy THE biggest Memory Card you can find.  If you shoot in RAW + L, it eats them alive.  I had to wait for my Ultra II 2 gig and ended up using a standard 1 gig for a while.  Now I just need to decide if I should shell out for more cards or to get an IS USM lens.
I was suprised when I used up the battery the first time, not because it went fast (it didn't) but because it uses the same as the Elura series Camcorder I have.
I can't say enough about it.  Even when I screw up a shot, like when my dog bumps my leg, I can still see great detail.  Canon did a great job with this camera and if you register it like I did, they answer even the rookiest of questions quicker than you would expect.
If you are looking for an upgrade from a point and shoot to a SLR, this is for you.  If you are already familiar with Canon's Menus and Programs, that's just icing.

Title: big disappointment
Content:
bought it..used it twice and the 'permanent filter' had come loose. the filter is glued(?) to the filter cup. uponcloser inspection, it showed that the filter was applied sloppilyat the factory causing it to be weakly held down on one side andexcessively more on the other side of the filter cup.I also agree with other review concerning the small water reservoirand the apparent malfunctioning power switch.A very disappointing product from a company with serious QAissues.

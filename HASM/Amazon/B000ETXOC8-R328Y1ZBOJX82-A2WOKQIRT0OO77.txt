Title: I like it.
Content:
It's not an ipod although it does look like one but it definitely is a very good product. It offers so many things that the ipod doesn't and in my opinion a better mp3 player. But it does have two drawbacks because of it not being an ipod. One is the cool-factor is not as high because mp3 players are pretty much called ipods now when they're not and people will automatically think that it can't be used with the greatest media player itunes when it can be.

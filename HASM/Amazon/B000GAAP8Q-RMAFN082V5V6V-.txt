Title: The best ever !!!
Content:
Well I bought this with my own money i am 15 and i love it. My mom has a mp3 player that she got a year ago and this thing out plays it by a mile. 
I love it. I Have put about half of my music on it and barely filled it.
If you Do get it I would sugest that you get a case for it right away just so that you do not scratch the screen and the body. i got a case that has a screen cover. And if you want you can get a variaty of cases i have a silicone case it works great. Ilove that case taht it comes in from apple it is so cool. I LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!

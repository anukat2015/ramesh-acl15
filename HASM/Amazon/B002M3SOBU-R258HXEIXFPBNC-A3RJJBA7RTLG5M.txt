Title: Apple Ipod Outstanding
Content:
I bought this for my 9-year old daughter for Christmas.  She's a straight-A student, District Champion for Cross Country running, and an overall fantastic kid.  This was all she wanted.  It was a great reward for her achievements.  She loves it.  It helps keep her organized, it has features that she uses over and over and is something she will have for a long time to come.  She forgot her passcode at one point and the downloaded instructions were easy to comprehend.  She plays wholesome games on it.  I just can't say enough about it.  It's wonderful and will be used by me as well when we travel.  Though the price is a little steep, I honestly feel it was worth it.

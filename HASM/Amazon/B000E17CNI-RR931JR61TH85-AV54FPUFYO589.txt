Title: Great MP3 player
Content:
I have the ZEN NEON for 3 days now and it works great. I used it to listen to MP3 files which are downloaded from my computer. Creative S/W works good too, very user friendly. Have to be careful using the control wheel, it take time to response to each command. It take me few hours to get used to it, and after that it works everytime. The ZEN NEON has a voice recorder and a line-in jack for external audio recording that the Ipod does not have. Only one complain is the headphone jack is not making good contact with the plug, I have to move it around to find a good position to have sound in both Left and Right channels...I'm happy with the ZEN NEON.

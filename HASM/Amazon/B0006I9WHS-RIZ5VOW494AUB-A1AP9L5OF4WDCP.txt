Title: Good space heater
Content:
The heater is quite good. My only complaint is that there is no real temperature control. It has an ON-OFF control. Whenever it is ON, it blasts the full heat. The ON period can be controlled (probably also the fan speed), nothing else. However, for its price, it is a good piece.

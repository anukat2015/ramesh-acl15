Title: Good heater, but not highly recommended
Content:
As written on the Amazon product review, this heater features multiple safety devices. But the lousy beeping noise whenever you touch the button is a disturbance. You can't even turn it off or seal the noise completely. Also, the operating sound isn't so quite. 
 It has a temperature sensor that gives you a function to let it be turned on only when the temperatures goes below a certain point, but the measurement is not always accurate. 
 The light that always glows is probably for safety at night, but it can be disturbing for your sleep. And don't count on it to save your electricity bill for a big time. It might be less consuming than other electricity guzzlers, but it still adds up a significant number on your heating bill.
 My recommendation is to buy a radiator if appropriate. It's more hygienic than this kind of air-flow electric heater that would have some dust built up inside of it as the time passes. 
 By the way, I saw this item costing $79 at Best Buy. Amazon currently has this item as low as $59. Amazon has multiple vendors of this item, so compare before you buy.

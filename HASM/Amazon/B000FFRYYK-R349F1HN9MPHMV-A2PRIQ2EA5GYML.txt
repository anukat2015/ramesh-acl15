Title: Very Nice Coffeemaker
Content:
****Update 2-27-09****
My coffee maker developed a leak.  I dusted off my original paperwork, and was very happy to see that this unit comes with a 3 year warranty.  I sent it back to Bunn, and they sent me a brand new unit.  Painless and relatively quick (less than a week).  Yet another reason to buy a Bunn.  The only thing I would mention is that I had to pay to have the old unit shipped back to them.  Cost me $13 UPS, so it's not really that big a deal, but I just have this old fashioned notion that if something is covered by warranty, it shouldn't cost the consumer a penny to get it fixed or replaced.  
****Original Review****
I don't see why anyone would buy a traditional glass carafe coffeemaker.  The heating element scorches the coffee after about 15-20 minutes, so if you haven't finished the pot by then, you end throwing the rest away.  At least I used to, until I discovered thermal carafes years ago.  
I really like this coffeemaker.  I am a big coffee drinker, and I usually make 1 pot in the morning, 1 pot in the afternoon, and 1 pot at night.  The quality of the coffee that it brews is excellent, and I like the fact that the coffee is ready in 3 minutes.  
A few other observations:
-I have not had any problem with the carafe.  No spills or dribbles, and it keeps the coffee piping hot for a good 90 minutes, and then drinkably hot for another 2 hours.  I especially like the fact that you don't need to open and close the lid to pour the coffee.  The lids stays in the closed position while the coffee is brewing and it stays in the closed position when you pour it from the carafe.  
-I have not had any problem with the basket overflowing or grinds in my coffee, but I have noticed that the grinds rise up to the tippy top of the filter, and I use Bunn filters which are a little taller than most.  Although I have not had a problem myself, I can see where someone who likes an extra strong brew and adds a little more coffee might have an issue.  For me it works, and I use about 10 tablespoons of coffee per full pot.  
-I don't particularly like the automatic feature that starts the brewing cycle as soon as you close the lid to the water chamber.  I would prefer to have a button to press, but its not a huge deal for me.  Like another reviewer, I can see potential disaster if I have company or overnight guests and they want to make the coffee, and I haven't briefed them on how the machine works.
-Price is high when compared to the Mr. Coffee type machines with glass carafes, but I really do notice a difference in the taste of the coffee when I visit friends and they break out their $30 coffee maker after dinner.  I think the price is a fair price for what you get, and although I haven't had it long enough to comment on its durability, Bunn typically makes products that stand up over time.
-The entire machine does have a rather large footprint, and it is bit taller than many coffeemakers.  I have alot of counter space and my cabinets are high, so its not an issue for me, but do yourself a favor and take 30 seconds to measure the space where you intend to put the machine to make sure it will fit nicely. 
Overall, if you're into good coffee, and you're willing to spend the money, and you're willing to overlook a few very minor flaws (see above) I would highly recommend this machine.

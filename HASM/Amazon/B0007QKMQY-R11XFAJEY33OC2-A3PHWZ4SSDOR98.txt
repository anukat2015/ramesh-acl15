Title: CANON REBEL XT
Content:
Wow!  Got this camera just before my Hawaii vacation.  Although I still haven't finished all the instruction, I did learn enough to take fantastic pictures in all kinds of different lighting.  Time exposures at night were superb.  High resolution results with the SLR camera cannot compare to digital instamatics with those tiny lens aperatures.  Recommend this for any enthusiast who lkie to control their on settings.

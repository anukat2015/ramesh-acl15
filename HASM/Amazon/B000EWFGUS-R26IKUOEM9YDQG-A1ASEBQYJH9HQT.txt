Title: Hot Hot Coffee
Content:
I bought this after reading all the positive reviews. The best thing about this maker is that it makes and keeps extremely hot coffee. It is quiet, the carafe never leaks when pouring and overall I am satisfied. I took a star away for a couple of reasons. The main one  being Amazon listed that a water filter is included, however, that is NOT TRUE. Since it is like trying to get in touch with the president to contact any one at Amazon, I just went ahead and ordered the filters from a vendor (at Amazon.) Also one of the prongs that holds on the lid was slightly bent straight out of the box and I know that it will not hold on long. I have emailed Hamiliton Beach about a replacment carafe in red because I know that is coming. 
The coffee flavor I am working on. I am hoping the filters will make a difference and I am trying coffee brands as well.  My old Braun made ok coffee but I still think for flavor you can not beat a Mr. Coffee. Also with well water I would probably fair better with using filtered water.

Title: Perfect for me...
Content:
I bought this coffee maker because I got tired of making single cups in my Senseo.  This is a PERFECT size for me...3 full coffee mugs - the size I use.  LOVE the fact I can use a "program" brew feature.
Maybe I was one of the "lucky" ones...but so far no problems.  BUT, just want to address some of the prior complaints.  
1) "Leaking"....none for me...just at the end when you flip the lid open to clean out the grounds, etc...simple condensation from the lid...just wipe it up.
2) "Not hot"....coffee was PRETTY darn hot....I CAN say, though, as time goes by, the 2nd and 3rd cup were "hot", just not SUPER hot as the first cup...I programmed mine to be ready EXACTLY when I get up....NOT 30 mins earlier,etc.  The process of brewing is REALLY fast, so IF you can't get the time that close, just have it ready the nite before....don't use the "auto brew" feature....just turn it on "manually" and it's done basically in 4-5 mins.
3) "Weak"....I used one "coffee scoop"...which is basically a tablespoon/cup...strong enough...depending on taste...maybe use a "columbian" coffee....the REAL stuff....that'll put hair on your chest!! LOL  Or, a French Roast....JMO
4) "Filter size"...well, I used what I had on hand...the larger sized ones. I made sure the "water arm" was placed properly to dispense the hot water into the middle of the coffee area...no problems.  BUT....I can say....using the "taller" filters (for the 12 cup makers) is DEFINITELY a far better practice...I noticed the grounds traveled "up" the filter after I opened the lid when done brewing....using a "shorter" filter (even though "look wise" they are a better "fit") it would DEFINITELY cause the coffee to overflow out the filter. Just make sure when you close the lid with the "taller" filters - a) the water "arm" is centered over the grounds in the filter - b) when you close the lid, be sure the "excess" filter material is "fitted" around the inside of the filter basket...it WILL obviously "crinkle" on the top when you close the lid since it's taller.  
Seems like a lot of work...but, just common sense stuff...for the money, and compact size, you can't go wrong !!

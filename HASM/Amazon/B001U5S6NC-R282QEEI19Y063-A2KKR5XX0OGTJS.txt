Title: Great laptop - one important tip
Content:
This is a nice little laptop with plenty of spunk.  Here is my biggest tip - if you plan to burn video DVDs, then please use Maxell DVDs.  I tried Verbatim and TDK, neither worked.  But Maxell seems to work.  I suffered about a month of pain trying to get a cousin's wedding from the DV camera to a DVD - I had no idea that the problem was with the brand of DVD I was trying to burn!
As several others mentioned, I agree that the Acer software which came factory installed slows the machine down and doesn't seem to add much value.
Otherwise - highly recommended.

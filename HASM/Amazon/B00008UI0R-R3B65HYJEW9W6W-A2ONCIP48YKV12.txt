Title: Utterly Disappointed
Content:
I am not completely satisfied with this vacuum cleaner as I had hoped for before I made the purchase.  I was so disappointed to find out that the handheld attachment IS not motorized. (Thick carpet on stairs need a vacuum with motorized roller brush to thoroughly disengage the dust trapped underneath). Within one year of usage, plastic parts started breaking here and there. The plastic material used on this product is of the very brittle kind. The lid for the tool holder keeps coming off the hinges-which can be annoying.  Now what really irritated me the most is the power plug and for the fact that it just stopped working.  Turns out that the two metal prongs on the plug were each broken in half.  I know that the plugs were made in China even though the label on the vacuum says Made in Korea. Very cheaply made that I could go mad. And just found out from an article that The Hoover Company was sold to the Chinese company, Techtronics. Did you get that?: HOOVER IS NO LONGER AN AMERICAN COMPANY.  The only good thing I will say about this vacuum is the suction but who knows how long that would last.

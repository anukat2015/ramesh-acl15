Title: Excellent coffeemaker!
Content:
The only drawback on this coffee maker is where you pour the water in.  It would be an easier design if it were positioned in the front corner.  That being said, the features of this coffee maker make it an excellent and useful machine.  The programmable timer makes life ever so much easier, and the auto shut-off is a godsend.  The styling is sleek and fits well into any kitchen that may have black or stainless appliances.  The timer also being *above* the coffee delivery system make this machine less prone to being 'shorted' out.  I love the beeps when the brewing cycle is finished too!
Great value for the money!

Title: Good if you maintain it
Content:
I've had this a 8 months now.  It is a good vacuum that does a good job at picking up dirt.  However if you forget to maintain it it slowly stops picking up dirt.
If I keep the 2 filters clean (once every 2 months) and clean the belt (once every 4 months) it picks up a lot of dirt, cat hair and dust every time I run it.
I was impressed by its moderate price tag. But the hose is difficult to use because it is short and it almost always pulls the vacuum crashing to the floor if you get too far away.

Title: Great camera for the keen enthusiast or pro
Content:
Having been used to using the more advanced settings of my D70 the first day I purchased the D300 I had to do a photo shoot of a Salsa class and took the worst photos of my life. Day two I read the manual and spent much time getting used to the D300 and customising the settings. My photos since then have been stella. 
Best bits compared with the D70:- Better colour, lower noise, better screen, better dynamic range.
The worst part of the camera is the sensor cleaning which is not really up to the task - poor at best.
Fantastic camera but you need to learn how to use it otherwise your photos will be dire. All the main things that you need to change are on the outside of the camera. 
In low indoor light I fould that the hand held pictures were a little dark and had too much image noise(ISO 3200 using aperture priority setting). One tip is to up exposure compensation by +0.7 or more which gives very quiet pictures which you can then post process to -7.0 if you wanted. 
The dynamic range of the camera coupled with the real time "Adaptive D-Lighting" means that I don't have to use my gradual grey filters so often.
For me the 12MP is not such an advantage as I never crop or print poster sized pictures. My Brother used a 6MP camera (D50) and actually produced poster sized photos for his company which they were very pleased with and paid him alot of money for. One of my customers was paid £3000 when he snapped 80 photos of a balloon going over his house with a D40. He approched the advertising company, his solicitor negotiated the deal - wow.
For the avaerage photo taker I would recommend the Nikon D40 which is an absolute bargain price and takes fantastic pictures. If you need fast shutter cycle times, complete and instant control of your photos and a rugged camera than this is one to consider. Highly recommended for the right user.

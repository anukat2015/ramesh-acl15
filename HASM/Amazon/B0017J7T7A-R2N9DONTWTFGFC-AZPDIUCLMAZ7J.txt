Title: Great product...don't order from amazon!
Content:
First I must say I LOVE this laptop. Upgrade to 4gb ram and it can tackle almost anything. I am, however, regretting buying from amazon. They no longer have the 30 day price guarantee (which you know is important when buying apple products). They do not advertise this change in policy. I recently tried to get the price difference refunded to me only to be put on hold almost 30 minutes and told that they no longer honor price drops. I am very disappointed amazon. That was the only reason I purchased through you instead of macmall or other retailers. Shame

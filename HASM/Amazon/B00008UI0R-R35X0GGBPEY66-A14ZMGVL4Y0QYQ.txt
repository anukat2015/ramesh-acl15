Title: Effective and easy to use
Content:
I bought this after struggling for years with a bargain upright that finally did me the courtesy of dying, and after a couple of weeks of use, I have to say I should have bought something like this model sooner.  It's very effective, especially on cat hair (I live with three of the little boogers, and a dog as well).  The "turbo" attachment is fabulous on upholstery, and the dirt receptacle is easy to remove and empty.  The adjustable suction power is a very nice feature, as is the washable filter.

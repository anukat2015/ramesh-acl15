Title: Nikon's Best Digital SLR Camera
Content:
The Nikon D200 Digital SLR camera is the most versatile digital SLR that has been made by Nikon. Optically it is definitely the most versatile digital SLR currently available, since it will allow Nikon users to use most of their manual Nikkor lenses, and superb third party lenses made by Sigma, Tamron and Tokina. Therefore it will allow Nikon users the splendid opportunity of using the new ZF Zeiss lenses which are slowly being introduced by Zeiss and Cosina, most notably the new 50mm f1.4 Carl Zeiss Planar which is said to be a major improvement over the still excellent Contax 50mm f1.4 Carl Zeiss Planar. So potential users of this camera have now the best of both worlds, using both current AF Nikkor lenses and superb third party autofocusing zooms and other lenses made by Sigma, Tamron and Tokina, and such great manual focusing Nikkor lenses as the venerable 105mm f2.5 Nikkor and 35mm f1.4 Nikkor lenses and of course the new ZF Carl Zeiss lenses which are being made in Japan by Cosina under strict Zeiss quality control. 
The Nikon D200 builds on the D2X with regards to versatility for digital photography, and then adds some more, offering richer colors than its previous top-of-the-line digital SLR. I've been impressed with excellent reports I've heard about this camera's relative ease in handling, even under the worst weather conditions. So the Nikon D200 will appeal to many professional photographers because of its ruggedness. Without a doubt, Nikon has made a genuine winner which should allow it to retain not only its loyal following of professional and amateur photographers, but also attract others. A genuine winner which is well worth its expensive list price.

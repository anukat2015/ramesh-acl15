Title: Good personal laptop but short battery life
Content:
I wanted a laptop for cruising the internet and general purpose use.  I don't do gaming.  This laptop fit the bill in nearly ever respect, but I was quite disappointed by the short battery life.  It seems to discharge at a rate of about 1% per minute, so that gives 1.5 hrs of on-battery use.  Yeah, you could extend the uptime by dimming your display but that makes it quite difficult to read.  I'd say, if you want this laptop, plan on spending from 75 to 150 more for a 12 cell battery - prices vary depending on if you get it from HP or aftermarket.
Lots of people have commented about the metallic touchpad but I don't find it an issue.
I love the touch sensitive volume control and mute button.  Very handy, no fumbling around looking for the right key or key combo to adjust volume or mute.
Lightscribe works as advertised, kinda fun to make CD's and label them, but it does take a while (5-10 minutes).
I was tempted to give it just 3 stars (It's OK) vs 4 (I like it) and decided on 4 due to the value delivered.

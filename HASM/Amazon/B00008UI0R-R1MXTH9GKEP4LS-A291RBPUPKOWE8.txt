Title: UNBELIEVABLE VACUUM!!!
Content:
Bought this for use at a summer home ~ lots of sand and pet hair ~ and boy, does it do the trick and then some!!  I think it was sucking up stuff that had been in the braided rug for years!  I love the fact that there are no bags to replace, and emptying the container is very easy.  So is washing out the filter.
The floor brush has 3 suction settings ~ ideal for hard wood, tile ~ strongest setting is truly VERY strong and wonderful on carpeted areas.
I would highly recommend this vacuum!

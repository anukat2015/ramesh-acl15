Title: Doesn't get the job done
Content:
We bought this heater to help reduce our heating bills in the winter.  We looked at different space heaters for several days, read all the reviews, etc...Based on the very positive reviews for the Aloha (particularly the one about heating a cabin) we decided to give it a shot.  We were looking for something a little more powerful than a standard, small space heater, as we needed some heat in our fairly large living room/dining room combined area.  Well, we STILL need some heat in this area.  The Aloha doesn't do the job.  The output is very disappointing.  We feel the actual difference when we are literally within one or two feet of this thing.  After a couple hours ths radius grows to maybe 3 or 4 feet, but come on.  It's true that we're asking it to take the edge off a large room, but it's advertised as a "home hearth."  Some hearth.  The tiny Pelonis disc heater we bought for less than half the price cranks out much, much more heat in much less time.  Yes, the burning wood effect is realistic and cozy.  If you stare at it hard enough, it almost convinces you you're feeling warmer.  Almost.  The truth is, this "heater" is a lovely decorative piece, but unless you're heating a very small space, it won't take the edge off the cold and it won't reduce your heating bills.  And if you just want to heat a small room, why spend $160?  Just buy a Pelonis.  We're sending our Aloha back.

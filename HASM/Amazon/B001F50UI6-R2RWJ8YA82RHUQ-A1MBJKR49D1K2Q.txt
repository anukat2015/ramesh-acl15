Title: Easy Operation for the Technologically Impaired
Content:
It's really hard to improve on the reviews already here.  So I'll only say that as a 40-something, time-deprived, technologically challenged person, I found this device amazing.  I was able to set it up immediately without looking at the instructions (not necessarily something I'd recommend to everyone.  
It synched my daughter's ipod music collection from our pc (Hallelujah!) - something my previous cheapo player couldn't do.  Now we can quit using up all our pc space w/2 sets of music saved in different formats!  Now here's something I may regret -- but I didn't have time to fully charge the unit (4 hours is recommended for a full charge).  So I literally took it out the display case, downloaded the music, unplugged it from the pc, and went to work.  It has been playing ALL DAY!  Do these things come fully charged already??  I'm amazed and LOVE my new toy.  Thank YOU, Santa!!

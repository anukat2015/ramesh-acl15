Title: Absolutely Wonderful!!
Content:
Being physically challenged with severe RA has made this cleaner indispensable for me!  I can't bend over to clean up spills & messes so I keep this "flip It" right near my kitchen which has a bamboo floor and it always looks fabulous.  Its lite weight makes it usable by someone with limited strength.  I love it.
Initially it was a bit difficult to get used to.  I tried vacuuming with the wet side & couldn't imagine why it was so hard to push--duh!  I also had to learn that when washing the floor you need to release enough water to wet the pad at the start or else it is too difficult to push.  My bathrooms have ceramic tile floors and they have never looked so clean.  I always use the heater for tile.
I highly recommend this item.

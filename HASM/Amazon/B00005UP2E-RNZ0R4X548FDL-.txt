Title: Good on wood, braided rugs, hopeless on carpet
Content:
I have a small townhouse and replaced my huge upright vacuum with this sleek canister. It has powerful suction and works well on wood and very dense rugs such as the braided rugs in my dining and bed rooms. However, it is hopeless at picking up cat hair on carpet. You really need a vacuum with a power brush to get up cat hair on carpet.The filter is also icky to clean. Fine dust really sticks to the filter. Plus, I find I don't want to see my dirt!

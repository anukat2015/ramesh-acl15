Title: The Perfect Coffee Maker
Content:
I have had the Hamilton Beach BrewStation for years.  Every time I need a new coffee maker, I choose the version of the Hamilton Beach that is on the market at the time.  I love having the "hands free" way of pouring coffee.  Its easy to use, easy to clean and there is no glass coffee pot to break, discolor or have that gross burnt coffee flavor and smell after its been sitting for a while.  The BrewStation does not burn and always tastes fresh.

Title: This is an amazing Camera
Content:
Got this one about 4 weeks ago. I like it very much. Simpler interface than the 7D. Takes great pictures in low light, especially when you use the anti shake. Good high ISO pictures too. 
Well worth the price especially due to anti shake feature. You can shoot raw or Jpeg. Excellent camera. GEt one !

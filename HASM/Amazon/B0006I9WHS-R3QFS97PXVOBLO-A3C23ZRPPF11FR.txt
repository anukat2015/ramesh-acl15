Title: Do NOT buy...worthless within 5 weeks
Content:
As with some of the other bad reviews, this heater stopped working after 5 weeks, with 20 minutes of use per day. Of course, this happens to be outside of the Amazon 30 day return period. So, we are stuck.
Altho it comes with the Honeywell name on it, the box indicates manufactured by Kaz.

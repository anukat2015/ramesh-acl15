Title: Best Heater!!!
Content:
I can go on and on about this heater.  All I will say is that it is absolutely awesome and worth it's wait in gold.  Trust me!!  I researched many heaters and found the Consumer Reports review on this one and bought it.  No regrets and I could probably make a lot of money if I became a Honeywell salesman, I rave about it that much.  The only negative, and I say that lightly, is I wish there was a light up display option.  Even that isn't even that bad.

Title: Great for those with little ones & pets...love it!
Content:
I bought this to help save money on my electric bill, which it has done pretty well. I like the simple, sleek design and added features. Moreso I am impressed with the safety features of this unit. I have a curious  three year old, and an indoor dog and this heater has truly been a lifesaver! The dog will sometimes bump the heater, and it immeadiately shuts off. I love that feature! I feel safe knowing that if it ever fell over, I wouldn't need to worry. 
A few other things that reassure me (especially with the little one)...The plastic silver part of the unit does not get hot. Another feature that I love is that you need to push the button on the base, and the one under the plastic cover to turn it on. My daughter was smart enough to lift the lid and push the button, but it didn't come on due to the base button not being on. 
Lastly, I love how lightweight it is, as others I have seen seem to weigh quite a bit more, and the remote is a bonus for when I wake up in the middle of the night cold, I don't even have to get out of bed to turn it on! 
Definately would recommend.

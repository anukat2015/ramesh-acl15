Title: Won't buy Creative again
Content:
The battery could not be recharged after sitting off for 30 days. The online support pages were not helpful, and it was impossible to contact a person for technical help. Thanks for some kind people at a Creative forum I tried all the tricks and finally gave up. I won't buy another Creative product. I am now in the market for a new mp3 player.

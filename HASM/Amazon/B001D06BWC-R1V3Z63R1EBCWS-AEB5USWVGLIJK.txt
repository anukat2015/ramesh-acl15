Title: What a device!
Content:
Ive always seen Archos players in gadget magazines and thought that they look really nice and can store lots of data. Not too mention the cost; when you compare the size of the device and storage space, its such good value when you compare it to other media players like the iPods.
I have but one grumble with the player and that is how Archos has "locked" a few of the file formats so that if you want to play them, you have to pay for the codec. Granted, its only an extra $30, but it is a bit annoying.
I had read many reviews of this player before i bought it and they all seem either really good or bad.....
Well all i can say is the player is fantastic!
The touchscreen is responsive, the storage capacity is amazing, the media format playlist (once youve got the extra codecs) is unrivaled by any other player and the battery life is significant! I recently had over 5hrs of video playing on the player before is started to die, when Archos only recommends 4hrs playback.
If like me, your not an Apple fan and are looking for a device to play videos and music, while also accessing the internet; i recommend this player!
Best gadget buy ive bought!

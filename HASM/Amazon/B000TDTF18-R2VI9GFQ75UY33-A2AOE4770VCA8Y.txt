Title: Brilliant
Content:
So I cant believe its not standard for coffee makers to have the pull out water fill like this one does. Its great because you dont have to move it. Its super convenient. Makes great coffee. Setting the timer is kinda annoying b/c you have to scroll through an entire 24 hours because there is no foward backwards time, it only goes one direction.  Anyway, great coffee maker, reliable, not expensive, easy to clean--have bought one for a friend and she is obsessed too.

Title: a warm sun like, enegy saving heater
Content:
I waited to write this review since I did not get my bill for electricity till now. It is really energy efficient. I only spent 12 dollars more a month after I started using this heater. Like other people who wrote reviews, a high power(800W) was too bright and too hot to be around the heater. But a lower power was nice and cozy. It gives me a positive energy and warmth. I use this heater instead of a night lamp for readings. Also, it is very safe so I can use it around my 2 yrs old.

Title: Good overall
Content:
Good all around.  Something as simple as the spout shape and easy pouring makes a big difference.  If I have any complaints it is that the red on light is difficult to see and distinguish from the red numbers of the clock at a distance.  Could have been placed elsewhere or had Green numbers to contrast?  Not a big deal since auto off is a good feature to have.

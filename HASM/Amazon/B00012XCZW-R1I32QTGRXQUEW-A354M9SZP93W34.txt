Title: Great product that BREWS coffee
Content:
This is a reservoir type brewer. It has a "pot" that is kept at 200F (proper coffee brewing temperature). This hot water then is moved over the grounds via a displacement system. The result is that you do not have the sputtered steam and cold water mix that scorches and underbrews like the flash element (non reservoir models). If you like heavy, thick, scalding coffee - get a $10 machine. Do not turn the "vacation switch" off or the reservoir will go cold and you need to wait a while for it to recover. Also, if yiou do not use it for a while - like a week - you need to add a little water to the reservoir to top it off.
It uses about as much energy as a set of landscape lights...
Consistant brewing quality.

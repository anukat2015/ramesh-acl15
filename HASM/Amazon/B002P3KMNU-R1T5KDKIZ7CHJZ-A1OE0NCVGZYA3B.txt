Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
As usual, when something seems too good to be true, it is.  I purchased this notebook about 30 days ago when comparing it to the MacBook Air and Dell Amado.  Boy did I make the wrong call.  Of course, the notebook is perfect so long as you don't need more than 10 feet of range for a wi-fi connection.  You will see bars, but no connection beyong this point.  It is amazing to me that so many have this complaint, yet when you call ASUS (I have twice), they tell you it is a router problem.  Really, a problem with every router in the US??  On the upside, it's a very stylish, light and user friendly notebook with a great optional ASUS drive that fires up in 8 seconds.  As I said, if you don't need wi-fi access or will always be close to a wireless access point, it is a great laptop.  For the rest of us, given the terrible customer service, pay the extra $400 and get a Dell or Apple.

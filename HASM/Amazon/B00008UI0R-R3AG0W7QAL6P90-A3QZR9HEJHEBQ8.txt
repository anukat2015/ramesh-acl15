Title: Could not be happier!
Content:
With 3 teenagers and I dog, I have been through numerous vacuum cleaners and would give them no more than an average rating.  My mother suggested a canister type vacuum and I found this one online.  I bought it was a birthday gift to myself and boy am I happy!!  The carpets look fantastic, the suction power is above anything I have had before, and it's easy to get around the house.  The dirt cup is easy to remove and it was amazing what the vacuum picked up.  I would highly recommend this product!

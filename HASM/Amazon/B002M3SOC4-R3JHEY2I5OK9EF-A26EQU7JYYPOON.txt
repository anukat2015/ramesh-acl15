Title: Like it
Content:
I'm sure everyone is aware of the 3g features.  I wanted one of these for the longest time and finally pulled the trigger.   Yup,  its all that and a bag 'o chips.  I'll try to sum up the reasons I like it and the wish list for the next generation (which I'm sure is already in development).
Wickedly portable - the size is great and the screen is surprisingly readable;  Wi-fi and bluetooth work well; I like that I can use bluetooth earphones (it's great to be unteathered); Browsing seems speedy;  There are a ton of free apps - both utilities and games for this puppy.  It makes a great little pocket computer and oh, yeah its an MP3 player! : )
The wish list: Better battery life - the life is good but if you use a lot of graphic intensive games + wi-fi the battery drains quite quickly; a built in microphone, not just with the earphones (duh) - easier with apps like shazam ;  a camera - this would be useful for a ton of reasons;  sd or mini sd expansion slot;  better bluetooth support for Motorola headsets.
Is this a must have product?  Nope.  Is it a wickedly cool product, that's fun with some nice features?  Yup!!!!  Would I buy it again?  Yes, but I consider it a luxury item.  You have to keep in mind that this technology will be continually improving.  Next years model will most likely have a few more bells and whistles for the same price.  So beware of buyers remorse.

Title: the money you save means nothing if you have to replace it anyway
Content:
Within five months, the next button broke. Using it to go forwards, it would either not respond, or think I'd pressed it twice and skip a song. That's even worse than it sounds. Imagine trying to get back to your place in a 120-minute podcast when the fast-forward button either doesn't work or skips to the next track and fast-forwards into it. Most times I tried to push the menu button (the same button pressed another way), it took several tries. It would set the beginning and ending points of a loop (how is that even a useful feature to have?) so instead of seeing the menu, I would hear something like a skipping CD while I kept trying to get to the menu.
Another month after that, the play/power button broke. Now I can use it as a bulky 2gb thumb drive, but not an MP3 player.
Other complaints: the shuffle/repeat settings are named in a confusing way; exploring files starts where you are with only next/last navigation and the option to go up a directory listed as though it were the first file in your current directory, which means you have to skip through each single one of dozens of songs (from the current track to the first/last track in the dir) before you can access another folder; the battery is held loosely, making the player shut off when bumped, but I fixed it by putting tape inside the battery cover.
Pros: AAA battery, for those of us who neither want to buy a portable recharger nor can stop in the middle of a trip because we need to plug our MP3 players into a computer or outlet to recharge. There's a loop at the top where you can put a string through and wear the player around your neck.

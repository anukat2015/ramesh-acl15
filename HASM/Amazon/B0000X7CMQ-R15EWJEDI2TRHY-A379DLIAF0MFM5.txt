Title: Keeps your coffee HOT. Easy to use.  Timer feature is excellent!
Content:
I was forced to shop for a new coffeemaker after learning about a recall of my treasured Starbucks Barista Aroma(tm) Stainless Steel 8-Cup Coffee Brewer because of a fire hazard. 
I searched the reviews here on Amazon and decided upon the Zojirushi -- the company has an excellent reputation for top-notch home products, including: thermal carafes, beverage dispensers, bread-makers, lunch jars, and rice cookers. (In Japan, Zojirushi is known as the "Sony" of thermal home products.)
My old Starbucks coffeemaker also had a carafe, which kept the coffee hot for a couple of hours. The Zojirushi, however, keeps coffee hot all day -- and even overnight (I learned this when I forgot to empty it the previous day).
The clock and timer are much more user friendly, too. I love waking to the smell of freshly brewed coffee.
One note: The lead review for this coffeemaker states that this model requires the hard-to-find No. 3 filter. This is an error. The coffeemaker is designed for No. 4 filters (perhaps the company modified it since that review). I plan on getting a gold No. 4 filter so I don't have to use paper filters. I suggest ordering both at the same time (wish I had remembered to do so when I ordered mine).

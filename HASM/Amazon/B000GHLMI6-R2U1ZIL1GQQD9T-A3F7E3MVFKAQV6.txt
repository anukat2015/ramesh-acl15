Title: Disappointed
Content:
I purchased the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 10-18-07.  I liked the concept of "touch-n-pour".  This product cleans very easily.  The programable feature is easy to use.  Disappointed that the coffee is only luke warm.  You don't need to bother blowing and slurping those first few sips.  Also,  It started leaking this week.

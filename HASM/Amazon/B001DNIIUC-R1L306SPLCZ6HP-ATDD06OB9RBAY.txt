Title: Defective
Content:
I purchased this to heat some space in my small two car garage.  The unit would run for 10 minutes and then shut off, seems like it went into protection mode as I followed the instructions, unplugged waited 10 minutes and it would work again for another 10 minutes.  This heater is strictly a radiant heater, not sure why it oscillates if it doesn't blow heat.

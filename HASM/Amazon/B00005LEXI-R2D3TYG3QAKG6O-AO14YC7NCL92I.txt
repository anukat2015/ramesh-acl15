Title: Keeps the kids warm and toasty
Content:
This heater is perfect for tent camping in larger tents.   It's not too big and pretty stable.   We have a large cabin style tent that sleeps 6-8.   On our last camping trip to our local Southern California mountains in January 02, the temp at night got down to the mid 30's.   Mr. Heater kept us almost too warm, even on the low setting.   Our kids ended up sleeping on top of their sleeping bags.   The safety features and BTU range were the deciding factors in our purchase.   The low oxygen sensor gave us peace of mind(I still purchased a battery operated Carbon Monoxide sensor for the tent for extra precaution)and the BTU range was good.  I could not find any other indoor approved heater that warmed us so well.   At first I purchased a infer-red heater that attached to a bulk talk.   I found too many reasons why not to use it in the tent(No low O2 sensor, no heat shield, and no low setting).   Don't chance it.   Get an 8 to 12 foot extension hose and a bulk tank.  The portable tanks won't last all night.   I wouldn't recommend this heater for small tents(not enough space, not enough air volume, and the potential for Carbon Monoxide problems is too great).

Title: Elegant, Powerful, yet Mobile machine - I adore mine
Content:
This laptop is gorgeous. Thank you, HP, for finally rivaling Apple with something that doesn't kill my budget. The mouse on this particular laptop can get weirdly greasy and get stuck in a weird zoom mode, but that is the only flaw I've found in over seven months of use. I'm a software developer and it's worked great (even Windows 7 pretty much rocks) for developing, running several programs and VMs, watching movies, etc. The lack of an optical drive has annoyed me once, but the size is so convenient and there are plenty of USB ports for file transfer. The sleek look actually does garner stares when I visit coffee shops. This laptop rocks.

Title: Good suction, flimsy construction
Content:
Recently had the house tiled, so we needed to replace our upright with something easier to use. After doing some research, we settled on this Dirt Devil 082500 canister. It has impressive suction, and is easy to use. The hose, fittings, and dirt cup latch are all very flimsy and we are worried about the long-term. So far so good. On sale, it seems like a decent purchase.

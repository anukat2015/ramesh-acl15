Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
We used the previous model and it made good coffee but had problems with condensation dripping all over etc. With this model all of those problems
have been corrected. This coffee maker makes a much better pot of coffee then the previous one. We also like the option of the 3 heat settings for 
the carafe as well as mild and strong settings. The main reason we bought the previous model was for the 14 cup capacity. With all of these improvements
this is the Best coffee maker we have ever had.

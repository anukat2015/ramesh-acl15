Title: Disappointing.  Lukewarm and slow.
Content:
This product claims to keep coffee hot.  It doesn't even MAKE hot coffee.  The coffee comes out just above lukewarm, and quickly loses that warmth.  You certainly wouldn't want to leave it in the pot for 5 minutes.  Keep hunting for a better coffee maker.  I know I will.

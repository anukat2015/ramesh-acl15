Title: The ONLY way to make coffee!!
Content:
This is the second one of these we've bought.  I moved to Portland for work and took ours with me.  My partner tried a Hamilton Beach knock off - but it didn't work well and made crappy coffee.  I bought him another one and had it shipped to him from Amazon.  He's very happy to have the Cuisinart back - and I'm glad we have two in case one of them goes bad!  If it is mine that goes bad I will be making a trip back home to steal his - or order another one from Amazon - for me - this is the ONLY way to make coffee.  I LOVE the convenience of not having a carafe to wash or look like crap sitting on the counter.  And if you are like us and drink a lot of coffee - you'd be happy to know that you can quickly make a new pot.  Also, you can use the tall coffee mugs with this because the drip tray on the bottom pulls out to reveal a cut out down to the counter that allows you to put a tall mug under the dispenser!  It really is a GREAT way to make coffee!!

Title: New to DSLRs? This is the one.
Content:
I got this camera in December of 2008 and have used it quit a lot. I love it. It is built, designed and made for people starting off in the DSLR world but will carry you pretty far. It has many features that will keep you on your toes for quite a while and wanting to learn more and experiment. 
If your new to DSLRs then this is the best way to go! Don't go out and buy a $1500 camera unless you have had major training and experience in photography. This will suit your needs and standards from learner to (in my opinion) professional. It has a great price tag and is easy to learn. Just read the book a bit, get out and shoot! 
Note that your eye will take you farther than the camera but having a camera with options will help. If you aren't good or don't have an eye this camera (or any other) isn't a magical wand but it will allow you to grow more as a photographer.  
The lenses you use is also important!!  Compare prices, do your research and go for the better lens! Not the more expensive!
I use mostly Sigma! Compared to a Canon there is no difference is picture quality. The only difference is in the price.  
I use the Canon SXi for Model photography, HDR, and any thing else I want to shoot. 
To see the Pictures I have shot with the Canon SXI go to www.flickr.com/photos/hpyflyboy That way you can see for your self what can be accomplished with this amazing camera. 
I am still playing with it so I don't know everything. 
For the price, for the quality, for the ease, and for the ability to really grow in photography this camera won't let you down.

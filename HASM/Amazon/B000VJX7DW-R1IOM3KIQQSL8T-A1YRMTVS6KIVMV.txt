Title: I Upgraded from A D50 what an upgrade!
Content:
I wanted to upgrade from my D-50 and seriously thought about a D-80 and then when the D-60 came out looked at that.  This is more expensive than the D-50 (which I love - but is going to my daughter) or the D-80 or D-60, but what an awesome camera.  
The metering system is fantastic.  I use it to shoot a lot of sports, high school football games and Yankee games.  Its fast, it takes beautiful shots even at night from the outfied.
It also takes every Nikon lens.
What more can you ask for.  If upgrading from another Nikon this this is the camera to get.

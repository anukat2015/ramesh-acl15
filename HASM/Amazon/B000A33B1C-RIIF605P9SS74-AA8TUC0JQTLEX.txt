Title: Some actual performance measurements
Content:
Just bought this, still deciding whether to keep it.  Ran a little experiment, thought it might give folks an idea of what to expect.
Room size: 154SF  (11x14)
Finished, unheated basement room, with one insulated external wall, the rest uninsulated interior walls.  No windows, door closed.
Outside temp: 15F
Put heater in center of room
Put thermometer on a desk 6 feet away
Started at 10:20AM with a cold heater set on high, measured for 5 hours
10:20AM 49.6F
11:20AM 55.9F
12:20PM 59.9F
01:20PM 62.6F
02:20PM 64.4F
03:20PM 65.8F
So roughly 2 hours to raise the temp 10F, 4 hours to raise the temp 15F
Unfortunately, I suspect that none of the competing electric heaters would do significantly better, since they're all limited to 1500W.  Since I'm reluctant to try a fuel-burning heater in an unventilated space, I may stick with this Delonghi and call it good enough.

Title: I was surprised to see all the negative reviews
Content:
I've had my machine for about a year and have had no problems.  It is one of the most complicated coffee makers to use though and you must READ THE MANUAL.  The clock problem everyone talks about is not a problem but is in the design.  There is a function that counts the number of pots of coffee you make and doesn't let you make any more after 200 pots without resetting the counter.  This has to be set out of the box.  I think you hold the on and prog buttons down together for about 5 seconds to reset it.Mine seems to make the coffee fine and i don't use the espresso that often but I've used it a half dozen times with no problems.  I don't like my coffee that hot so its fine for me.  No coffee maker has ever satisfied my wife though and that's the same for this one.I am looking for a replacement filter which should be replaced annually and that's how I ended up here.  Anybody know where to find one.  We have quite hard water and the charcoal filter was why I bought this unit.  The coffee taste a lot better that my previous maker that did not have one.

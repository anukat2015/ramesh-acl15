Title: Performance + Screen Size = Good Buy
Content:
I wavered between the IPod 80g and this Zune.  After going to a retail store to check them out (which I reccomend) I decided on the Zune.
Pros:
1.  The screen is much larger.
2.  The unit is better looking.
3.  The pad is more versatile and fresh compared to the thumb-pad on the Ipod.
4.  Performance has been stellar and I have trouble filling it up.
Cons:
1.  Not as many accessories.
2.  Not as much available on the Podcast and video download within the software (yet).
3.  Some people don't like the pad's touchiness in terms of trying to go down and getting sent left instead.
4.  Having to put up with IPod owners.

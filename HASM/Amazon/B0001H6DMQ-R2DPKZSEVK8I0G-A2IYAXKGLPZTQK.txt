Title: BY FAR THEE BEST VAC. I HAVE OWNED IN YEARS.....
Content:
HAVE HAD THIS VAC. SINCE XMAS 07'. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT. ONLY ONE PROBLEM, THE FLOOR ATTACHMENT DOES NOT STAY ON, NO HOLE TO HOOK IN. THE POWER TO THIS VAC. IS AS STRONG AS IT WAS FROM DAY 1, THAT IN ITSELF IS A MIRACLE, WITH ALL THE JUNK VAC. OUT THERE. I KNOW, I HAVE BOUGHT THEM ALL. I WILL NEVER OWN A SEARS KENMORE EVER, NEVER ALOUD IN MY HOUSE AGAIN. YOU PAY HIGH PRICE FOR A PIECE OF JUNK.
I GIVE THIS VAC. THEE HIGHEST RATING IT TAKES, PLUS AMAZON, IT WAS IN MY HOUSE WITHIN LESS THAN 1 WEEK.

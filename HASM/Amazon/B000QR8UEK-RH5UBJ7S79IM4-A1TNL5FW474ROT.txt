I bought 2 of these heaters after my central heat went out.  I almost bought 3, but I'm glad I didn't because having more than 1 on in the same room or breaker will throw the breaker.  It doesn't heat the whole room, but it does get the chill out. With the unseasonably cold weather it's understandable.  The box read that it works best with the central heat on but turned down to about 65 and using the portable heater too. It's supposed to help control the heating bill.  I don't know much more my electricity bill will be having them as my only source of heat so we try not to keep them on for more than an hour at a time

Title: It is working fine, so far
Content:
Other reviewers have complained about the reliability of this vacuum cleaner, but so far I haven't had any problems. It has very strong suction, which I like. It is also light weight. It is a lot easier to use than my old Kenmore which was very heavy. This vacuum is pretty noisy though. The dirt bags for the canister are small.
You may be buying replacement bags more often. Replacement bags are easy to find. I found some at Lowe's.

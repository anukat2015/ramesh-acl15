Title: Worth every penny
Content:
I bought this as a gift for someone else so I haven't used it myself but let me say that everyone I told about it said they used it or had a friend with one and I heard nothing but good. Quiet...quick to produce hot beverage...easy to use. Makes a great product for office use or for the home if you can't linger over doing it the old-fashioned way. Everyone else bought it for considerably more than I did, so that's a bonus for me! I highly recommend buying the reusable K-cup however as it saves on packaging and it environmentally friendly. Plus you can use your own favorite coffee or tea in it.

Title: Excellent camera
Content:
I've been using Canon cameras since 1995, first an Elan 35mm, then a XT Rebel, and now the 40D, and by far this is the best camera I ever used, it's quality is outstanding, and the colors, definition and sharpness you get are awesome.
I do photography mostly on skydiving activities and on performing arts.
I'm very happy and considering you don't have to pay for development, it's price will be nothing when you think this is a camera designed for 100,000 + shots, it's alloy body makes it rough and trustworthy. 
Some people talk about Sony Alpha or Nikon but for me Sony in the SLR arena is a rookie and Nikon was the best when 35mm were the standard, but on these days of digital photo, according to many experts, has become the second choice.
Highly recommended.

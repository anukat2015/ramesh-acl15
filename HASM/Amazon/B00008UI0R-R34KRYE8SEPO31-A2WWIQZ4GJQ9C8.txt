Title: Huzzah for Hoover!
Content:
I didn't realize how bad I had it with the upright bagless Bissell before it finally quit.  Dust everywhere, floors and rugs that just weren't quit clean and yes, I did clean my filters; washing the danged foam rubber rings, squares, etc.  On the day-the-vacuum-died, I went to Consumer Reports and looked at their ratings knowing I wanted to go back to a canister.  Big decision:  back to a Kenmore with bags or the Hoover bagless?  "Another bagless" I mused?  Decided to save half the price of the Kenmore and go for the Hoover.
Oh, but what a bagless!
This puppy has suction!  3 adjustable levels of suction!  It pulls the powerhead across the carpet suction!  The dirt collection system is wonderful.  The filter cup and filter clean easily!  No more foam, this filter is meant to last! 
It is a vacuum worth all the exclamation marks.  This vacuum reminds me of the vacuums we had way-back-when; but improved.  Buy it and you will be a happy camper.

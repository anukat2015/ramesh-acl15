Title: A300K Review
Content:
The A300 is, but for one flaw, an excellent camera. My pictures are consistently good. The controls are not bad. I would prefer more dials and less menus; however, the critical functions are readily accessible through the function button.
The flaw I mentioned deals with the vulnerability of the (LCD) liquid crystal display. Because that display swivels, it stick out further from the camera body than would otherwise be the case. As such it is more likely to be damaged or scratched. Note that, unlike the Olympus E-510, the LCD does not swivel against the body for protection. Incredibly, Sony does not make available, at least for the US market, any attachable protective covers. The "Lens and Accessory Compatibility Chart" on Sony's US website does list a plastic sheet (part # PCK-lS3AM) as available for the A300 (and the A350). The "Accessory" catalog, at pages 9 and 18, lists the same part. Nevertheless, this part is not available in the US. This was confirmed to me by phone with Sony Customer Support and by letter dated May 8, 2008, from Sony Customer Affairs, that Sony Marketing has made the decision not to make this protective part available in the US. No reason was given. The part is available in Europe, but, not for shipment to the US.
This is poor decision by Sony. Putting aside the question of listing the part as available when in fact it is not, the camera needs this part. Sony does make such protective devices available for the A200 and A700. The A300 and A350 need this protection more than the A200 and A700. The decision to deny American buyers the protection offered to Europeans is senseless.
I am sure that the aftermarket will eventually remedy this oversight. Until then, unless you have a compelling need for live view and/or a swiveling LCD, stick with the A200.

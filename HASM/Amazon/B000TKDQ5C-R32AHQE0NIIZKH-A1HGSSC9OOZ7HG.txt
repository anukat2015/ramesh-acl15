Title: Nice little room heater.
Content:
This heater was 1 of 3 that I purchased for my children...3 children; 3 different heaters.  This particular heater was purchased for my 10 year old.  It's very small...a bit smaller than a gallon of milk.  Pros:  small, great heat, great fan, quiet.  Nice background white noise when sleeping  Cons:  No automatic shutoff when it's accidentally moved and no digital readout.  Can't control the room temperature but I'm still able to figure out what setting to put it on so it's 'not too cold, not too warm' for my daughter.  I feel that it's safe and, certainly, you can't go wrong with the price.

Title: No Buddy of Mine
Content:
I bought two Big Buddy Heaters from Amazon and neither one will run off a 20lb. propane tank with the hoses provided. The hose valve seat is to deep for the regulator to open, thus no gas flow. Mr. Heater seems to be giving me the run around. The heater works great with the 1lb. disposable propane bottles.  If I can get a hose from Mr. Heater that will work I would love this little heater, but until that happens I am not to happy with it.

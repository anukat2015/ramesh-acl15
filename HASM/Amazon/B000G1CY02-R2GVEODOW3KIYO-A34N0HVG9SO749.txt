Title: Nice, but broke after 1.5 years
Content:
I really liked this heater, but it broke after 1.5 years, I used it for 2 winters.  Then, it started making electric arcing noises, and I saw light flashing from the front of it.  It was quiet (it has no fan) except for some occasional popping/expansion/contraction noises when it was cycling off (cooling down), but most of the time they were hardly noticeable, only once in a while would it make a loud enough pop that it got my attention, it made less popping sounds on the low setting than on the high setting.  It is a sad society nowadays that products are not made to last long.  It is now taking up space and polluting the earth in a landfill.  I was going to open up the case and see if I could fix it but it has non-standard screws.

Title: E-PL1
Content:
This camera is useless outdoors without a viewfinder.
Location of movie button is bad and gets activated to often by accident.
Memory chip location is bad and camera has to be removed from tripod or quick release for chip to be removed.
Picture quality and macro abilities are excellent.
Low light level shooting and anti shake ability is excellent.
Bad camera for vacation or casual personal outdoor use.

Title: Perfect for me!
Content:
I'm not a great one for writing online reviews, but for this unit, I just had to!  If you love fresh-ground coffee first thing in the morning, and are not a morning person, this is the coffeemaker for you!  When my old coffeemaker was showing it's age and I was looking for an upgrade, my son-in-law suggested that I check these out.  After checking the online reviews, here and elsewhere, for several Cuisinart models, I wasn't convinced.  But my son, who has one, was insistant, so I bought this one.  It made me a believer very quickly! While I had a coffee grinder, and used it with my old pot as often as possible, more often than not, I just used ground because I couldn't deal with a grinder first thing in the morning.  No longer a problem!  Once I got used to the routine, I can now clean, set up, and program this unit for the morning in 2-3 minutes!  (I'm sorry, but anyone who thinks that's too much effort doesn't need to be grinding beans at all!!) I also often reuse it a couple of times a day without cleaning it, and see no loss of performance or quality.  (Just clean it once a day, and you're fine!) In addition, experience says that coffee strength always varies from unit to unit.  It's not about the machine, anyway; you have to figure out how it does what it does, and adjust water/coffee ratio yourself to get what you want!  While I haven't had mine long enough to tell about durability, right now, I'm wholeheartedly recommending this unit to anyone like me!

Title: Sooooooo Happy!
Content:
First of all, I am an amature photographer, still on a learning curve.  I was an avid film SLR (Minolta XG1) user until I bought this camera.  After extensive research, I finially purchased a D50.  Over one year later, and over 15,000 shots, I couldn't be happier.  The pictures are just amazing.  The camera is quick and does what you want it to do.  If you are a point and shooter, or someone who does not like to make adjustments for the optimal picture, this camera is not for you.  I believe that most people's problems come from lack of experience, bad lens, or in rare situations, a bad camera.  You must have patience with this camera to get the best out of your pictures.
PROS::::
*Sharp, sharp, sharp - always depends on your lens - I shoot with a Nikon 18-200 VR, and even get wonderful pictures off of a Sigma 70-300
*Instant start up
*Instant pictures - press the button and picture is taken immediately
*All of the manual control you could want
*Great autofocus and metering, once you learn how to use it - I shoot in Aperture priority with autofocus
*Great pictures stright out of the camera - I rarely post-process
*SD cards - I love the small size and quick write and read speed.  Plus the price keeps dropping
*Nice LCD - large, and gives an idea of what the photo looks like, but do not trust it (as with any LCD)
*Absolutely amazing battery life - I have taken over 300 pictures (without flash) with the battery still reading at full strength
CONS::::
*Not ideal for indoor/very low light situations.  Bad noise at high ISO, and poor built in flash
*No light on the top LCD screen
*I don't really care for the "dummy" scene modes - this just may be due to the fact that I haven't used them extensively
*It was hard to get used to the small viewfinder when compared to film viewfinders.  But I did eventually get used to it
*May be too small for big hands
With the low light problems, I am looking into a Fuji F30, since most of my low light pictures is with friends and I don't want to carry around a bulky DSLR!
Overall, I couldn't be happier!  It may be cheaper than most of the other DSLR's, but the power lays in the lens and the photographer.  It is an awesome camera that I have learned so much from.  Hopefully I will have this gem for a while to come!

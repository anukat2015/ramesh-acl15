Title: Hoover windtunnel evaluation
Content:
I just got rid of a Kenmore cannister vacuum which weighed a ton and did a fair job. I purchased this new Hoover because your customers had rated it highly. It does a great job cleaning, is relatively lightweight and easy to move around furniture and probably up steps. And the cost is low compared to the costs of other vacuums. You do have to empty the dirt cup often but this new Hoover still beats my old one with a bag.

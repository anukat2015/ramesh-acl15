Title: Disappointing
Content:
I have owned several Krups coffee makers for many years and this model is a major disappointment.  Where to start with the design flaws.  The two piece carafe handle came apart within a month and will barely stay together.  As other people have commented, the water level tube always has bubbles in it.  Programing not intuitive so if there is a power outage you need the book.  And you have to unplug it and reprogram when it decides it needs to be cleaned.  I don't have hard water.  And the light thing is just weird. On, off, blinking. There are better buys for the money.

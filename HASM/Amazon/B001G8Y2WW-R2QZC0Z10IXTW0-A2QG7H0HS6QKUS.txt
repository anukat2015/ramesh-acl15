Title: Frustrating design flaw
Content:
The thermal coffee pot is designed in such a way that you have to turn the thing nearly upside down to get the last cup and a half out and half the time it spills becuase you've got it turned upside down! Very frustrating! It is also next to impossible to get the last half cup out, so in my frugal mind, I'm losing a half cup of coffee with every pot. I know, its probably less than a pennies worth of coffee, but its the principal of it. 
Not sure why others are having problems getting the grinder out, it comes out very easily on mine, but it does get a lot of moisture in it post-brew, creating a bunch of sludge that doesn't just rinse away. There are too many parts to clean, which I knew going in, but I liked the whole idea of progamming, grinding, etc., so I thought I'd just deal with it.   
I like it ok, will hang on to it, but won't buy another one.

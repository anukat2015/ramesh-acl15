Title: Never made heat for a second
Content:
I messed up and bought this nice looking heater at Home Depot at the end of the winter....plugged it in the next winter, disappointed that it doesn't work at all.  I've messed with it for hours.  I'm thinking that if I pour gas over it and light it, maybe it'll at least put off heat for a couple hours.   I won't buy Funnyweld/KRAPZ again...unless its for a gift for someone I don't like.    Anyone want a Heater?.....it looks great, would be great as a paperweight on a big desk.      Can I sue this company if I get frostbite because their device doesn't work???    So much for their quality control guy......I hear they fired him because he kept finding too many nonfunctioning units.

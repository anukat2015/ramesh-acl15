Title: Best Buy Version
Content:
I have the Best Buy version with 500GB.  This is an amazing machine.  I did a lot of research on laptops and decided to go with this one.  It is the perfect balance between weight, style, and performance.  It is a speed demon of a laptop.  Very fast start up, no lag, and has everything you want except bluetooth.  The battery life is amazing.  It charges quickly and lasts throughout the day with my wife and I using it.  It does not come with bloatware either.  The sound is nice and loud (at least compared to our 4 yr old presario).  
I was going to go for a 13" laptop, but for a little more you can get this 15.6" that is just as light and comes with an optical drive.
The cons, if you type on it like a mad secretary on a desktop keyboard trying to meet a deadline then you might notice some flexing.  Also, I made some changes to the trackpad setting since there were some scrolling features that did not work well together. 
Seriously, this laptop looks and performs like it should cost over a grand.  Just go for it.

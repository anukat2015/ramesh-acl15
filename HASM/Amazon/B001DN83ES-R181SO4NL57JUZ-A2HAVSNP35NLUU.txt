Title: Terrible purchase - Don't Do It!
Content:
My husband purchased this laptop for me for Christmas. It's very cute, but completely non-functional if you want to use Belkin wireless to connect to the internet in your home. It is NOT compatible with Belkin routers. After hours upon hours on the phone with Dell (who claimed it was everyone else's issue), Belkin (I have two other computers using this wireless router and they work fine), Trend Micro (two other computers with no issues with Trend Micro) and even paying $100 to have a technician find out what the issue was, we realized it was the wireless card. 
I called Dell back (another set of countless hours repeating the ENTIRE situation over and over) to inform them of this and they ordered a brand new wireless card (same exact one as the one that didn't work with the Belkin before) and had THEIR technician replace it. He couldn't get it to work either. However, they were willing to allow me to return it for a full refund. I am buying an HP!

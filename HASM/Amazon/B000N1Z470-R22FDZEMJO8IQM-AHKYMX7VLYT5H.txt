This is the best heater I've ever bought, and I have bought several of all kinds over the years.  I bought is about 8-9 months ago and have used it for most of that time.  I use it in the baby's nursery, which is a converted 2nd floor porch, making it the coldest room in the house.  The thermostat is just what I was looking for.  Like another reviewer wrote, sometimes the thermostat was off a few degrees (less than actual room temp), but I noticed that this occurs when there's a pocket of warm air in the room (we have hot water radiators so there is very little air current).  I have resolved this issue by turning the oscillation on and placing the heater closer to the windows, and it has read the temps accurately since.  When you set the temp at 79 degrees, the heater kicks on at 78 and shuts off at 82.  I wish the range was a little smaller.  It is the most reliable heater I've had, lightweight yet very sturdy, would buy it again.

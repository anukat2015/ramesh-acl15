Title: May inexplicably stop working
Content:
I received this for Christmas 2009, and it worked well out of the box.  I got about maybe a half dozen uses out of it, and then one day it stopped working.  I plugged it in, and the little red indicator light on the side lit up right away--that light should only come on when you depress the switch to start the brewing process--and I found this odd.  I unplugged it and tried again, and the light came on every time it was plugged back in.  Well, I filled it with water and got it ready to brew, and plugged it back in, and the only sign of flowing electricity was the red indicator light.  Its brewing days seem over.  Read the other reviews and you'll notice that this happens rather frequently with this product.  Buyer beware.  It was great while it still made coffee, however.

Title: Beware
Content:
Purchased vacuum new in March of this year - suddenly stopped working. Took it to an authorized repair shop 5 weeks ago. I was shown an entire room full of the vacuums that were waiting to be exchanged - seems the repair rate on these vacuums is high and because of the technology, the vacuums are usually replaced instead of being repaired - or so I am told.  At any rate, it is 5 weeks later and I still do not have a vacuum.

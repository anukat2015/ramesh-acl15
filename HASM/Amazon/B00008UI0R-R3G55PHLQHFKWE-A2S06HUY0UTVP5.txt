Title: Powerful vaccume
Content:
I had much doubt about this vaccume before ordering it.  I've had it now for two weeks and I'm glad I got it.  Its suction power is great.  I was especially surprised at how well it cleaned the carpet.  The suction is so powerful that I have a hard time pulling it back.  The attachments are very handy.  The only part I don't care much about is having to clean out the canister....otherwise, overall a good vaccume.

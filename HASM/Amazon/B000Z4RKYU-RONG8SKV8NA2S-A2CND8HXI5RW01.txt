Title: I like the smaller brew station
Content:
I loved my old brew station which served me well for years.  But being the only coffee drinker in the house it was more than I needed.  While it is called 6-cup it is really 2-3 larger servings.  This brew station turns off two hours after brewing and the coffee still tastes good during that period and even later when I reheat in the microwave.  I recommend this brew station.

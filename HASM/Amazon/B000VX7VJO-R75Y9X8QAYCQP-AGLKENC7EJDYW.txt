Title: Breville Single Serve Coffee/Tea Maker
Content:
This was a replacement for a Keurig model that I had.  This Breville is upscale from the Keurig model.  It is pricey but in my estimation, worth the price -- you just need to shop around for the best possible price you can find.  I like the sleek look of the stainless steel.  Like other reviewers have stated, this one does seem to "splash" a bit more but the clean up is still easy.  If I had to do again, I would definately purchase this Breville model again.

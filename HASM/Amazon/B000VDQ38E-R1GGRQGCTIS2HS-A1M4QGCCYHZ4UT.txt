Title: Works great for us!
Content:
I bought this vacuum not because we had pets, but because I was looking for a heavy duty vacuum.   Our old Oreck had trouble with the hair from a pair of long haired humans, and was always getting clogged.  I've had this vacuum for about a month now and it's been working great.  The first time I used it I had vacuumed with our old Oreck the day before and it still picked up half a container full of dust and dirt.  It has made our old carpets look better too!  This is my first bagless vacuum and seeing the amount of dust and dirt it picks up really motivates me to want to vacuum more.

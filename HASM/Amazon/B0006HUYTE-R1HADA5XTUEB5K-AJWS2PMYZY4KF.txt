Title: Great suction for bare floor
Content:
This is a very good vacuum especially for bare floor, great suction power for a small canister. I had a Eureka Mighty Mite, the tiniest one, which are not manufactured anymore, and I liked it, so I decided to get this Eureka Sanitaire to replace the old one.
I am very pleased with the suction power but one complaint I have is the noise, the motor is very loud, more than a typical vacuum.
For the price under $100, it is a great buy.

Title: An Excellent Choice
Content:
The Sony Alpha a300 is an excellent choice for a modern DSLR at Sony's very attractive price point.  The fully functional Live View [with real AF, tilt LCD and automatic viewfinder curtain] adds an exciting and useful facility [especially on tripod with a remote shutter control].  The Super Steady Shot feature [Sony's in body image stabilization] works very well and makes the function available with any lens.  The a300 user [even more so the a350] will likely appreciate the full image quality available from the image sensor using Sony's pricier lenses, but the Minolta A-mount allows continued use of the many fine Minolta AF lenses and accessories.  The Smart Teleconverter [digital zoom] is useful on all lenses and works very well.  The build quality is good, but the camera should be handled with some care.  All in all the a300 is a very useful DSLR and very attractive at Sony's pricing point.

Title: Wouldn't accept this vacuum if it were given to me for free!
Content:
This vacuum sat unopened in the box for 2 months while we renovated our home and by the time I used it and realized how terrible it was, it was too late to return for a full refund. 
First off, I was warned by previous reviewers: this vacuum is not, I repeat, IS NOT made to vacuum carpet. It does as good of a job as your 4 year old's pretend vacuum would do! Even on bare floors, I find myself having to go over each area twice in order to pick up everything. 
The WORST thing is, if you have a home bigger than 1000 sq ft, you'll probably have to vacuum it in 2 sessions, as this vacuum has a 'convenient' automatic shut off when it gets too hot. I consider myself lucky it I can vacuum half of our 2000 sq ft home before it shuts off! 
All in all, I will suffer thru this poor investment until I atleast feel I've gotten my money's worth, and I won't even bother trying to resell it used!

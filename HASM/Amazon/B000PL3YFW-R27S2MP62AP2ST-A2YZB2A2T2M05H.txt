Title: Not Great for Audio Books
Content:
When I first came to write this review, I was mad and my review would have reflected it.  But a suggestion from T.J. softened me a bit.  I'm talking about the apparent lack of a resume function (by which the MP3 player resumes where it left off).  It may not be a big deal for music, but it's a HUGE deal for hours-long audio books!  I even called Coby who basically told me that you get what you pay for.  So thanks to T.J. for knowing more than Coby in this regard.  But moving my book to the root directory didn't solve all my problems as the player has a nasty habit of haulting occasionally.  After some VERY frustrating experimentation--which otherwise revealed that the player had locked up--I found that I could briefly employ the Fast-Forward function to restart my book.  I'm otherwise impressed with the player's expandability and standard battery.  But for audio books at least, I agree with Coby that I got what I paid for.

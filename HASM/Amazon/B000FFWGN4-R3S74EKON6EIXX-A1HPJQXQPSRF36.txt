Title: Bad Brush Roller Design -- breaks after a handful of uses
Content:
I have a golden retriever who sheds like nobody's business, and after reading the reviews for this product I decided to get this vacuum.  It even had a picture of a golden retriever on the box -- how could I go wrong?
Well, the FOURTH time I used the vacuum the brush locked up, stopped rotating, and the axle got so warm that the belt melted and broke.  I did a little bit of searching online and discovered that this is a common problem.  Apparently it is easy for dust/hair to get inside the brush and jam up the ball bearings that allow it to rotate.  I called Bissell and was told that this was a "wear and tear" issue (I guess this brush is designed to only last FOUR uses), but that they would replace the brush and belt ONCE as a concession to me.  They said if it ever happened again, I'd have to buy the brush and belt off their website (about $30 total).  When researching this problem I found a website where one man said that his roller jammed up every 3-4 months.
I don't know about you, but spending $30 every 3 months on replacement parts for a $160 vacuum seems a bit ridiculous to me.  You might as well save your money for a year and get a Dyson.

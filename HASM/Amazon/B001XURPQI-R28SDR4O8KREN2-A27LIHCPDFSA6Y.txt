Title: First DSLR
Content:
The Canon Rebel T1i is my first DSLR and it's a good beginners DSLR. It consists of a little bit of everything. ISO isn't the best but enough to shoot in low light. [it does get noisy anything higher than ISO 800] The interface is easy to get used to. The price was unbeatable at the time I bought it!

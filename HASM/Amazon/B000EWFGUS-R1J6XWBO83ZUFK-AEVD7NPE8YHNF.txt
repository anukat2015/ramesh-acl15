Title: Hamilton Beech coffeemaker No frills, great coffee, and it's RED!
Content:
I was fed up with built-in grinders and computerized settings that malfunctioned on other coffeemakers I've owned when I found the simple, no-frills Hamilton Beach 43253 coffeemaker. I immediately loved the color (red) and the low price, but have found the design to be superior with the easy-to-fill water compartment, easy-to-clean wide-mouth carafe, and very simple settings. And yes, it makes GREAT coffee!

Title: Inconsistent Autofocus and BUSY indicator
Content:
I wanted to love this camera so much. It takes great pictures and the colors are vivid WHEN THE AUTOFOCUS work properly. I would get 6 shot of unfocused pictures out of 10. I tried all the settings (Manual, P, ATV, AV, A-DEP) and the results are the same. One would think that by setting the camera to AUTO MODE you would at least get consistent good pictures but it's not the case. Also, there is this BUSY indicator which appears for no valid technical reason. I was taking picture of the San Francisco BAY at around 4:30 pm. It was slightly cloudy and the sun was just peeking through the clouds. I set up the ISO to 200, shutter speed to 1/1250 (I was also focusing on the small waves and that's why I went for the faster shutter speed) and sometimes to 1/50 , wb to daylight, and also cloudy. There were a several shots where I got the BUSY indicator when I didn't even use the flash. The BUSY indicator delays your shooting significantly, and it performs like a P&S camera.
 I have P&S digital cameras (sony, panasonic, and Canon) and their autofocus are dead on.. no problem whatsover. For a DSLR, although entry level, one would assume that the autofocus will be accurate on automode. I am dissappointed with this camera. I think canon cameras are great unfortunately, I probably got a defective one. I also ordered the Nikon D40 last month. It was a great camera but focusing was bad as well. It is just frustrating. By the way, I have very steady hands so camera shake is not an issue. I hope Canon will fix this problem soon, or at least during production so it will be fixed when the camera is out for sale.

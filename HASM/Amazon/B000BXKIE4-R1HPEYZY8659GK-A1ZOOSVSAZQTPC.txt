Title: Not very impressed
Content:
I have found that this vacuum is a bit heavy and cumbersome.  I've had it less than a year and the power cord no longer works.  Also, I find that when I have the sweeper "on" while vacuuming the hardwood floors, it seems to just spit dirt around rather than pick it up.  I just don't think it's that powerful.  I'm disappointed and shopping around for something more lightweight, quieter and thorough.

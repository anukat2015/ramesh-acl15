Title: Poorly Designed Electrical fittings
Content:
I had one of these for several years - I bought it in 2000 or so. It worked great for a long time and in 2008 it broke down - the fittings loosened up so that it wouldn't stay together. I duct taped it to make it go as long as possible but finally bought another one in July 2008. This one lasted about 6 months! Same problem - seems there is a short of some kind. I pulled it apart (literally took it apart piece by piece to see if I could find the loose wire) and can't find a thing wrong with it other than the carpet brush won't rotate. 
I think it is just poor design on the electrical connections.

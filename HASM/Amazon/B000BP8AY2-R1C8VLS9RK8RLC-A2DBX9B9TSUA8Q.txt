Title: Does not work.
Content:
the player has stopped working. it freezes at the welcome screen and does not move ahead.
it worked okay in the first 2 weeks . the following week , it used to stop at a song . restarting the player worked.
a couple weeks later , the player froze at the welcome screen when started. 
when it was working fine , it worked okay . 
i have a 1 GB player 2 years ago of the same kind which still works fine.
Maybe i just got a faulty piece this time around

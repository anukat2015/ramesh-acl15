Title: Dyson DC21 eats expensive rugs
Content:
I have an old DC02 from England, loved it so much when I moved to the USA I bought a big stepup transformer so I had 240volts to run it here in New York.The hose on the DC02 broke and its not a US available part so I bought a DC21 as replacement.
The DC21 has a single fatal flaw,the motorised head has bristles so hard they shred persian rugs. Yes it has an off button but guess what the brains trust set it up so everytime you turn it on the motorised head starts up again. 
We have little kids who delight in turning the machine off then on again as you vacuum. This sadly kills it for me.Of course if you have new rugs and want them to show the abrash that comes with age, the DC21 will help the rugs get there all the quicker.

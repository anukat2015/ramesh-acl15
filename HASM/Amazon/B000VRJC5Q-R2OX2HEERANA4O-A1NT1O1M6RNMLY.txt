Title: Minolta 7000i to Sony a700
Content:
I am only a beginner when it comes to the full operation of a camera, I have been guessing at settings w/o taking notes for 20 years, With many of awesome results, along with some bad images. I decided to take an extra leap from my little digital Fuji s3000 to the a700 since I already own a few of the best lenses made by the "Minds of Minolta". I plan on to take the time and really learn how to use a camera. Going digital will enable me to save some money in film purchasing & processing; anyway that's the excuse I used on "the other half" to justify my purchase of the camera and it's accessories. A bit spendy, but it will be the last camera I buy for a long time. It may very well be my last camera purchase, so might as well make it a goods one. 
I have no real technical information for the use of this camera, but so far it just amazes me with the functions and all the configurations seem to be endless. Easy step by step instructions.
I think I made a smart choice. So all you Beginners don't be afraid, take the leap.

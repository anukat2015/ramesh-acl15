Title: Fantastic Vacuum
Content:
This is by far the best vacuum we have ever owned. Works fantastic on both bare floors and rugs. Bought it for bare floors as our new house has no carpet. Comes with floor head included along with the motorized head for carpet. The motorized head might be difficult for some people to use with the suction turned up on high. Well made machine, glad I got this one after all the research I did. Amazon had best price for this model and I had this vacuum in my house in a matter of days with free standard shipping. Very powerful machine.

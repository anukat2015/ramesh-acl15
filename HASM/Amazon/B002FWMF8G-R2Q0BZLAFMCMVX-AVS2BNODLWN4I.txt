Title: love it
Content:
This product is easy to use; easy to clean; and makes good frappes.  You have to tinker with the recipes to make it suit you personally, but that's no problem.
I add extra coffee and put a scoop of MOCAFE frappe iced coffee blend in with the ice and milk (and sugar) and I get what I think is a perfect frappe every time.
Love the product.
That being said, you could make them with a blender and coffee pot, but I find that I can get a much smoother frappe with the Mr. Coffee than the blender (but I don't have the best blender in the world).

Title: It's a solid product
Content:
I got this coffeemaker when my old Braun (a model a step down from this- without the time feature) bit the dust after 14 years. To me, the coffee I get from a Braun is consistently better tasting than other models. Before I got this, I tried cheaping out and getting a Hamilton Beach that was onsale at Kmart,  because I couldn't find a Braun in a brick-and-mortar store. After a week of the Hamilton Beach I ordered this Braun online because the coffee was tasteless, it took FOREVER to brew one cup, and the carafe was hard to clean.
What I like about this Braun is that it brews VERY quickly, the coffee tastes good, it is easy to clean,  and easy to program for automatic brewing.  I have not been using the gold filter - I got grounds in my cup once - and I"m used to using paper so I just don't use the gold one, no big deal. 
The only minor thing I don't like is, that the clock for automatic brewing is losing time. In 2 weeks it loses about 2 minutes. I can deal with this by reprogramming the correct time, but it is annoying.
All in all though, I would recommend this product. It was a good deal for the money and I hope it lasts me another 14 years.

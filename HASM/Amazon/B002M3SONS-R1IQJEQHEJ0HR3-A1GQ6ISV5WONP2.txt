Title: Perfect companion for the gym
Content:
I've been waiting for a small shuffle to take to the gym. Finally Apple has come out with the perfect sized shuffle. Yes, it's tiny and the headphones are expensive to replace, but it's perfect when you use it while running or lifting weights. It's not bulky and you can clip it to the sleeve of your shirt using the built in clip. It's literally the size of a big paperclip and weighs about the same. I like that it doesn't have video capability, because really who needs that? That also helps keep it small and lightweight. I travel a lot for work and it has great battery life. It lasted on my 6 hour flight with constant use and didn't die on me.

Title: The touchpad blows
Content:
This touchpad is a useless POS.  I had  to buy a mouse, just to use this laptop... which, of course, defeats the purpose of having a laptop.  Save your money.  The guy who designed the thing should be flogged, and the dork nozzle who approved the design should be made to listen to Barbara Streisand music and then flogged.

Title: great streamline pc
Content:
Great umpc(ultra mobile pc), very small.  Only con is the vista installed slows this otherwise speedy umpc down.  Buy the u810 with vista business and downgrade to windows xp, included with the business vista not home premium version.  Keyboard is small but can be gotten used to.  I was really impressed with this product would highly recommend to anyone looking for a small portable computer.

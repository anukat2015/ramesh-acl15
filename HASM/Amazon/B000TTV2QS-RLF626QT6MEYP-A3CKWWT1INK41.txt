Title: RV Heater
Content:
Bought this for our RV in hopes of getting a quieter and more efficent heat source than the rooftop heat strip.  This heater is quiet and does a good job of heating this relatively small space.  My only complaint is that, on the automatic setting, it turns on at 2 dergress less than the desired setting and off at 2 degrees above the setting.  While I understand the need for this, it makes it difficult to pick a tempurature that will be comfortable through the entire range.

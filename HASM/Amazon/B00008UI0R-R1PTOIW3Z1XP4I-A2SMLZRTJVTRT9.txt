Title: The tale of 4 vacuums
Content:
We had a Dyson it did terrible job on wood/tile floors - gave it to thrift shop. So we purchased 3 vacuums over the last month (Hoover S3765-040, Hoover U6630-900, and a Bissell 37604) from local big box stores.   Sorry Amazon too much risk buying expensive items from you when you do not how they will work. The best by far is the Bissell 37604.   It is the only one that we did not have to use a stick vacuums to clean the floor where the dogs sometimes sleep.  It was the very best on the indoor/outdoor carpet, area rugs, and the tile.   Also it is very easy to use and clean.   Shows that you do not always need to spend a lot of money.

Title: CHEAPLY MADE, EASILY BREAKING PLASTIC
Content:
I HAD HIGH HOPE FOR THIS HEATER BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS. 
GOOD THINGS
----------------------------
IT HEATS SO IT'S A GOOD HEATER.
IT LOOKS GOOD.
IT HAS A THERMOSTAT.
BAD THINGS 
----------------------------
CANADIAN COMPANY BUT MADE IN CHINA WITH CHEAPEST PLSTIC.
 IT BREAKS VERY EASILY, WHEN I OPEN THE BOX, FIRST THING
I'VE NOTICED WAS THE BROKEN HANDLE.
IT'S NOT ENERGY SAVING LIKE  THE BOX SAYS BECAUSE IT HAS HIGH WATTAGE
NOT LIKE THE OIL FILLED HEATER BECAUSE OIL FILLED ALSO HAS 600 WATT BUT THIS ONE 
LOWEST IS 950 WATT.
BOTTOM LINE. IF YOU HAVE PETS OR KIDS, THIS IS NOT A GOOD HEATER BECAUSE IT'S 
VERY FRAGILE. I HAD ANOTHER BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS BIONAIRE COMPANY. I'VE BOUGHT ONE AIR CLEANER FROM SAME COMPANY. WHEN I'VE MOVED THE CLEANER TO ANOTHER ROOM AND IT HITS SOMETHING AND THE OUTSIDE PLASTIC COVERING BROKE DOWN LIKE THE POTATO CHIPS. TECHNOLOGY IS GOOD BUT I HOPE THEY MAKE OUTSIDE LITTLE BETTER, WITH BETTER RUBBERIZED PLASTICS OR MORE METAL. WHEN WE PAY THIS MUCH , THEN WE SHOULD GET A BETTER PRODUCT. BOTTOM LINE IT' YOUR CHOICE

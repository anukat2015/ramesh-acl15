Title: Love it, Love it
Content:
This is my second Miele vacuum.  I asked for this one for Christmas, and while none of my friends could believe I actually wanted a sweeper for Christmas, it was my only request.  I bought this sweeper for our lake house.  I wanted a smaller vacuum than the one at home but one which still had a motorized head.  This works like a charm.  It even uses the same bags as my one at home.
It is pricey, no doubt, but my first has worked for 4 years with no loss of suction and no other problems, so I expect the same great performance from this machine.
I am an "old" woman and have owned numerous vacuums.  Some women collect shoes, it was vacuums for me until I got these Miele machines.  Now I am done buying vacuums and shoes are looking much more interesting!

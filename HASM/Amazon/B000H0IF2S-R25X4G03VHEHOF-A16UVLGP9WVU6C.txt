Title: Review appreciation
Content:
I appreciate that people take the time to review purchases from Amazon.  I had an experience that a purchase was made from Amazon by me and the company turned out to be unreliable.  Thanks to the reviews I was able to realize this quickly and had good results.  Also, Amazon stands behind their products and I am very grateful they do.
We received a gift certifcate for Amazon and picked out what we wanted (iPod Shuffle) and received it quickly. They have great prices, so we get good service and save too. Thank you.
My son uses Amazon all the time also and has always been very pleased.

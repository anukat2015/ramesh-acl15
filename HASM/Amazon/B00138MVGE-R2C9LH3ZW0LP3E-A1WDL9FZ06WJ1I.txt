Title: great camera at a great price
Content:
Sony sent me a promotion for Mother's day advertising the alpha series cameras.  I checked the specifics on the camera and decided to get it for my wife.  One of the best decisions I've made in a while.  The camera is easy to use.  All features work as advertised.  Picture quality is best I've seen.  I also have a Canon EOS 20D so I think I can speak from experience.

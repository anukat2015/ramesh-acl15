Title: The worst
Content:
I had my secretary order this heater for my office.  It never worked from day 1.  I've tried every possible setting and it will only turn on for about a min before it shuts off and never comes back on again.  It doesn't stay on continuously on the Low or Hi settings like it's supposed to either.  I'm having her return it.  Total junk!

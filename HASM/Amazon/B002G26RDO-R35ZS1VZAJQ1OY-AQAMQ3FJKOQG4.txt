Title: Great Laptop. Great Price.
Content:
I have bought this laptop from Frys a few months ago. and in those few months i was transformed into a Toshiba Fanboy because of it. It ran perfectly. I had to call customer support a few times, but they were always problems i caused by my constant computer testing. Because i am a tech guy i use alot of programs that require some "Playing" with. But they were easily solved. The Windows Vista it came with was an Ok OS on it, I upgraded to Windows 7 a month ago and now this laptop runs about as fast as my friends "Super" computer on windows Vista. I love the 4GB RAM, and the 2.2 Duo Core AMD Turion Processor. Although it's graphics are in the mid range, it is better than the Intel Integrated GMAs that are usually used on every other laptop. It allows me to play Halo custom edition at High Settings, and Halo 2 at Medium settings. I can even play most of those higher end games on Medium settings with few to no hiccups at all (depending on what else i have running. The only downside of this laptop is, It has a 18.4" screen so it's not as mobile as other laptops. It's mobile enough to take from one house to another. But not small enough to take it to coffee shops and such. Overall I would rate it a 5/5. and i reccommend this laptop to everyone that wants to run games, and do countless other tasks. all with a mobile PC.

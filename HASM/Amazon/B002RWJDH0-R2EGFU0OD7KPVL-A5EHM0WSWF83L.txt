Title: Capresso 400 Replacement
Content:
After several years' fine service from an earlier version of this coffeemaker, I gave the MG600 a whirl. And so far I am not disappointed - same fine coffee, same expensive filters. ;-)
The only issue I encountered with the "upgrade" was that my old carafe did not fit. But that said, the new one does not leak nearly as easily as the original.

Title: World's hottest coffee
Content:
This percolator has good points and bad points. Good points: takes up little space on the counter, lid stays on securely, easier to clean than a drip coffee maker, brews coffee quickly, no more unsightly, mineral-caked carafes (Yay!), coffee never touches plastic- only stainless steel. Bad points: coffee is scalding hot, makes weaker coffee than a drip coffee maker.
 
The coffee comes out a bit stronger if you use a filter so try that if you think your coffee is too weak. (A filter also means fewer particles in your coffee cup). You can also try grinding your coffee to super-fine particles for stronger coffee. I thought of brewing the same batch twice to make it stronger, but anyone who has to leave the house to work (like I do) probably doesn't have time for 2 brews. The only other option would be to put more coffee in the basket before brewing - if you have money growing on the trees in your yard you might find this an acceptable solution.

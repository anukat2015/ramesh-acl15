Title: piece of junk
Content:
I bought this laptop 6 or 7 months ago and I would say this is not even a computer, it's a piece of junk. It's just fancy and color from the outside and nothing in the inside. It crashes all the time,and  when I type I don't see what I type on the screen (I don't know what technicians call this), and the fan makes the sound of a car engine when I called the company they said that's a 'KNOWN ISSUE' with the CS models, I'm like if it's a known issue it shouldn't be on the market!!! 
My sister has a sony vaio and my brother has one too and we are all complaining about them. 
I'm sorry sony but you're better off selling cameras and TVs not laptops.

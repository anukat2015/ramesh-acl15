Title: Cuisinart Kind of a pain in the .......
Content:
I like the machine and makes great coffee. The only two things I can complain about is:
1. The filter holder does not close easily. You have to play with it to get it to latch. From what I understand about this machine it has been the biggest complaint. If it is not latched it will make a heck of a mess.
2. It is a pain in the behind to clean. Every pot you have to take half of the machine apart to clean it up.
If you do like coffee this is a good machine for the price. Just don't be suprised about the couple of issues.

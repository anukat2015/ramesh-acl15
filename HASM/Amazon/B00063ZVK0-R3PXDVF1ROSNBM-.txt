Title: Are you sure? I don't believe you!
Content:
With such an expensive item, you'll think it should last you for few years. However, the one we got in November broke in less than 2 months.  During the time it did work we were happy with it. It can heat our 400 sq.ft bedroom to 10 degree higher in 30 minutes.  The morning the heater broke, I heard two clicking sound. When I got up to the heater, it was no longer blowing hot air. Contacting Vornado was a pain. They aren't available during the weekend, and when we finally got someone on the line, during the week, after few hours of redialing, the lady on the phone told us that we need to give her the serial number in order to obtain the warranty return authority number. When we tried again the next day, they told us we should probably return it back to Amazon since the purchase is still within their return period and we'll probably get the item back quicker.   Good advice, but they couldn't tell us that yesterday? And shouldn't they be the one to make it easier for their customers since the product was produced by their bloody factory!! Amazing.

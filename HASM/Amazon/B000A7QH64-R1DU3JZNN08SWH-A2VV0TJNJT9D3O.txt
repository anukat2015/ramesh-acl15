Title: This thing is no better than my Dustbuster
Content:
A while back, I bought a Dustbuster for little things around the house...kitty/puppy hair 'tumbleweeds', spills, tracked in dirt from outside.  It did an okay job, but where it really lacked was working on carpet.  Didn't matter how many times I'd run the vacuum over the same spot, it picked hardly anything up.  Being that I've been pretty happy with my Shark canister vac (for big jobs), I figured I'd give their cordless vac a try. Honestly, I'm no happier with it than I am with my Dustbuster.
1.  It does no better on carpet than the Dustbuster, even with the powered brush attachment.
2.  I was expecting better battery life.  The battery is no better, and yes, I followed the instructions regarding not touching it for a full 20-24 hours while it charges for the first time.  Furthermore...who still uses NiCd batteries???  Battery-memory problems?  What century is this?
3.  Kinda cheap that it doesn't come with some kind of wall-mount stand-charger (that's separate).
Tried it on carpet, even tried it in my car.  It was still a struggle to pick anything ground-in up.  So, not impressed.  I'll be bringing it back.

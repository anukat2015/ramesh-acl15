Title: Oil-filled radiator does the job
Content:
This is as good as space heater gets.  It's noiseless, very safe, and doesn't run up your electric bill.  It's unobtrusive, very efficient considering its size which is actually smaller than you would think.  It's perfect for a cold or chilly room in a big house when you don't want to heat the whole house if you're just in one room.  I find it works best when I can predict when I will be in the room, in my case, my bedroom before going to sleep.  I set the timer for 2 hours before I will be in the room so it has a chance to heat up nicely.  It heats a rather large room quite well and the heat feels "natural" not "spacey" like a space heater.  I have the timer to turn it off about the time I go to bed.  Highly recommend this excellent product.

Title: Best vacuum ever
Content:
This is the best vacuum cleaner I've ever used by far. It cleans like no other. All other brands are junk as far as I'm concerned. Your floor will be pristine like a museum floor after you've vacuumed it with a Miele. The miele picks up a large amount of dust, hair, and debris in just one cleaning. This Olympus model is all you need if you only have smooth hard floors and/or low carpeting. You don't need the more expensive versions. Even if you need a turbo tool for shag carpeting, it'd be cheaper to buy the Olympus and the turbo tool separately. Also it does a great job of holding in the dust without the hepa filter. I have a great sense of smell and I didn't smell any dust in the air while I was vacuuming. But you can buy a hepa filter for this model if you want to. The Miele has great suction. It sucks up everything very well. You can get the job done quickly because you don't have to vacuum over the same area for very long to get it clean. It's quiet even at maximum power. Every little thing about the vacuum is very well designed. It's easy to assemble and disassemble the vacuum. When you pull out the power cord, it holds its position very securely and easily. Then you step on one of the black panels in back and the cord flies back into the vacuum. There's only one thing that is less than ideal. The space inside the vacuum to hold the bag is tiny. But who knows, maybe there's a good reason for that too.

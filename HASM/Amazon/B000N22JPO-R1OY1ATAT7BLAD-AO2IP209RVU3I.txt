Title: Cheap is as Cheap Does
Content:
Looks great.. if only they put as much effort into the quality as the facade.  The machine function itself works fine: programmable timer, brewing, etc...  But there are so many frustrating short-comings it's almost not worth buying despite the $19.99 pricetag.
Yes, the area for filling the reservoir is ridiculously small.  You can fill it without spilling if you pour slowly, but this is a poor design that I'm surprised made it off the drawing table.  You'd think Farberware was the first company to make a coffee machine.
I've owned mine for about a year and the warming plate has begun to corrode!  As in RUST.  The company didn't even make the warming plate out of rustproof metals; it's just cheap iron, and poorly coated to boot.  When I contacted the company they said it was out of warranty, despite the fact that my problem is a production defect, not a warranty issue. If you buy this machine, just remember, you get what you pay for.  'Nuff said.

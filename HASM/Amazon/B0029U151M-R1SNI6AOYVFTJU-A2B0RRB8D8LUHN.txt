Title: Sweet laptop
Content:
Looks better in form and factor than my Dell XPS 13 inch.  I bought it for my son for his school. Now I am envious. 8 hrs of time against 3 hrs for my dell.   Seems pretty durable.  Timeline has a  beautiful LED screen which is so cool to look at.  Downloaded HD pics from my 12MP Canon and I can't believe how awesome they were.   Superfast computing on a SU2700 processor. Maybe it is due to the fact that this baby is using  the new DDR3 memory and has a frontside bus of 800.   Most laptop has the old  DDR2 and a bus of 667.   Wireless N is a bonus.   No regrets at all. I am dumping my 1 year old Dell XPS on ebay and am getting a new timeline for myself.   This is the best bargain by far on superthin notebooks.  NO tax too. Can't beat that.

Title: Excellent Macbook pro replacement
Content:
Let's start with this, I love this machine, is small, compact, beautiful and powerful.  It runs cold, it's easy to carry and it's easy to work with it.  Running Mac OS X, Windows or Linux every task is a breeze.  The 2.4ghz processor is fast and runs cold.  The 2gigs of ram is sufficient for my daily tasks, but for more powerful multitasking upgrade to 4 gigs.  The machine have all the connectivity i need, sans firewire, but I can live without firewire.  Beware this machine will hurt relationships!!

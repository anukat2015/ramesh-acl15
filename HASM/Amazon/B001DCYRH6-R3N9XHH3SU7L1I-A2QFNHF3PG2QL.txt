Title: Excellent Vacuum
Content:
I bought one of these in the 80's from a store in Naples, Florida and I am still using it today.  It has been a workhorse from day one.  I originally purchased it to vacuum out my vehicles but now use it for everything.  It has no brushes so hair does not cause a problem for this little baby.  I have four children and they all use it and I am still using it too.  We use it to vacuum rugs, baseboards, the wood floors, furniture, drapes, etc.  You name it, we use this little baby for it.  I would like to have another because we all seem to want to use it at the same time.  I bought one of these for a friend about 10 years ago and she is still using hers too.  She just loves it.  Need I say more?

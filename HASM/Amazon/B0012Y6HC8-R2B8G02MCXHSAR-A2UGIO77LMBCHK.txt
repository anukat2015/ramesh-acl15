Title: Awesome for the money spent
Content:
I couldn't be happier with this awesome camera. I was tempted to buy Canon D40, but after lot of thinking I wanted to concentrate on getting more by getting better lenses. I do not think I had to sacrifice - I just had to stick with my budget and this way I was able to get awesome camera and still money left buying better lenses!!!

Title: Happy with vacuum
Content:
I had a eureka rally for over 20 years.  The wheels came off but it still ran and was the best vacuum and I loved it, but to my dismay it finally died.  I  looked around for something to match the rally.  This seemed like a close fit.  It has good suction power, lightweight and it's good on bare floors. Not so good on rugs, but I have an upright for that.  The only concern for me was it seemed to get very hot, but I've been using it for over 3 months now and it has been fine.

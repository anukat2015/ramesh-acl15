Title: MP3 player that does not play MP3
Content:
Some of the MP3 files doesn't play. I even went through the trouble to re-encode the file, still not able to work.
Halt one time when I was outside and I cannot do nothing about it. Need to wait until the battery ran out.
Poor sound quality
In terms of price/function, ipod doesn't do a good job as an MP3 player. If you are looking for something that only "LOOK" good, go for it.

Title: What a piece of JUNK!!!
Content:
STAY AWAY FROM THIS VACUUM.  Electrolux took the perfectly good Eureka Oxygen and found a way to sell them at half the price by substituting cheap parts.  I owned the original Eureka oxygen for 5 years and it was fantastic.  I then decided to use that one for my basment and get the new one for our main floor.  BAD MOVE.  I've got wires burning up, and handles that quit working after a whopping 2 months of use.  I'm throwing it in the garbage now and buying a $100.00 Hoover.

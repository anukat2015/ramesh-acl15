Title: Don't Waste Your Money!
Content:
This product is a piece of garbage for the money.  Don't waste your time.  I bought it for my niece, and my very technically-savvy son loaded music on it - not easy, had to be converted to load it - he indicated that the player likely wasn't worth the money I paid.  Not easy to get the buttons to respond, the user manual is (literally!) 2x3 - that is 2 inches by 3 inches, and even with a magnifying glass, is not easily read.  The music cannot be easily played by selection - all in all, it is a waste of money and time - don't waste either on this!

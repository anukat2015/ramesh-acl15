Title: Good design - still needs work
Content:
I purchased this vacuum several months ago.  When it arrived I was impressed with the compact design and ease of use.  After literally 2 weeks my wife tells me there must be a error because the vacuum bag display (to notify bag is full) is lit up.  After 2 weeks how could this be?  So she opens up the unit and starts laughing hysterically.  What is so funny you ask?  She shows me the vacuum bag and it is the size of a  sandwich bag.  I didn't think it was as funny as she did.  After a month the plug retractor button breaks so you manually have to put back.  Now last week (used for only 6 months) the vacuum is not working at all.  It seems the brush has melted into the metal front.  The vacuum can't be fixed.  Lastly the plug is extremely small so very difficult to vacuum a room over 12 x 12 ft.  So skip this one at any price unless you have a VERY small place and vacuum infrequently.

Title: not worth it...
Content:
Let me start out by saying I waited a full year after my purchase to write my review. It is not worth it to buy this vaccuum!!! It works very well for the first 2 months and then It just loses power. The brush stops spinning and the electronic controls work when they want to .. There are times when I have to plug it out of the wall because the power button wont work..  all in all this vaccuum is not worth it. Right now I have a cheap vac that cost me about $40.00 That is still ticking after 6 months!!

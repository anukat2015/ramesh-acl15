Title: Hot little item
Content:
I bought one of these to keep me warm at my desk at work. At first, I'd put the thermostat/remote on my desk so it would shut off when the temperature there was warm enough, but one day I forgot to pick the remote off the top and I found out that it actually works even better there. Because of the fan intake, the temperature it reads isn't affected by the heat coming out of the heater, just the air coming in.
I absolutely love it now. It's kind of better than a blanket would be. Never gets too hot. Doesn't shut off until it's the right temperature at my feet. It's great.

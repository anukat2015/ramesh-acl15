Title: Grades are in:  Krups (A-), Nescafe (D+)
Content:
Krups did a FINE job in engineering this system:  simple to operate and clean up, does its job with finesse, and it has astonishing potential.  My only gripes are -- 
1)  Descaling requires a special-order packet from Krups; you can't just use vinegar as you can with a Keurig Single Serve Gourmet Coffee & Tea Brewing System.
2)  Since Krups allied itself with Nescafe, the coffee/espresso type is restricted to the current, very poor, instant-coffee-like offerings from Nescafe.
3)  Unlike the Keurig K-Cups system (granted, it's a coffee-maker rather than a pseudo-espresso machine), you cannot grind your own beans to make the specific blend or purity of flavors you'd personally like -- compare this to the possibilities of the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter.
As for Nescafe, they really blew this great opportunity to work with Krups on their fine machine.  As others have said, the machine is only as good as the coffee it makes, and with the limited, often-poor (often almost undrinkable) offerings from Nescafe, the best beverage you can make in this machine essentially tastes like instant coffee with powdered milk.
I STRONGLY urge Krups to use its leverage to license its coffee capsule technology to finer coffee manufacturers as Keurig has done, and I invite Nescafe to step up to the plate and make coffee of a quality on par with the Krups system they've been contracted to package grounds for.  I see a dim and short future for this machine unless either (or preferably both) options are explored and realized.

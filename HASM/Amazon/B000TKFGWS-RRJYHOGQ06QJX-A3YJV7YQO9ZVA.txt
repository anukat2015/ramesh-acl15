Title: Very satisfied
Content:
This heater successfully heats up small areas without taking up a lot of space. It's sturdy, solid, and doesn't get hot on the outside. It sounds like a regular room fan on a high setting. It smells really "toxic" at first, but that goes away after a couple uses. It warms up my unheated front porch to about 68F even when it's -10F outside.

Title: An Expensive Mistake
Content:
Sounds great. Grinds, brews, and keeps the coffee warm. The grinder sounds like an air-raid siren (at 5 am) and doesn't grind the coffee well enough to get a good cup of coffee (I spend too much on beans to drink Sanka). Okay, fine. I used my old grinder and put grounds in the basket. The basket pops open and gets grounds and coffee everywhere. This thing has &quot;blown-up&quot; so many times I just can't count any more. But, the thermal carafe works, (it's the only thing that does) it keeps the coffee hot.Finally though, I'm tired of this crap and I will return the coffee maker...

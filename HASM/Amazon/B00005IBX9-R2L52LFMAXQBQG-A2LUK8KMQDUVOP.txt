Title: Love this coffee maker !!
Content:
I own the matte black version of this coffee maker, no fingerprints like you sometimes get on stainless steel. Although it is a tall unit, it fits under the cupboards above, the only problem being I need to slide it forward to lift the top lid to fill the water. But this is a minor issue for me, since I love this coffee maker more than any other I ever owned. It keeps the coffee really hot, right up to the last cup. The pot doesn't dribble when you pour a cup, and it's a good sized pot. The replaceable water filters are inexpensive, and if your water is great you probably could go without the filter. I will never buy another cheap coffee maker again!!

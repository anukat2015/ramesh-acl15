Title: Big Bertha - yes she is....
Content:
I bought this burner to use in a home built, propane powered meat smoker.  The smoke box is 20x20x48 - so pretty large.  So far this burner works well  It has a large surface area so produces plenty of heat without being a high pressure burner like in a turkey fryer.  It will put out plenty of heat to get the metal box and meat heated to temp (225 or so) and then can still back down to maintain that heat without over heating.  The click start is ok, not a real big deal to have it, but nice.  For the money it seemed to be the best bet.

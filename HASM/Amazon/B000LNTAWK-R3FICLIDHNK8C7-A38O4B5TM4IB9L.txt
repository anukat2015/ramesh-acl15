Title: Nikon D200 is amazing.
Content:
The Nikon D200 is a great camera at a great price from Amazon. I consider myself an advance amateur photographer. I have used Nikon film SLR cameras for over 20 years. While many reviews put the D80 and D200 in the same category, the D200 is clearly more advance and well worth the little extra cash. More functions are available from the body without having to dig into the menu, metering and image quality is noticeably better and the body feels better in your hands. My only disappointment is the lack of a wireless remote option as there is on the D80 but there are many was around this. If you are a Nikon fan and have some of their accessories this is a must buy between the D80 and D200.

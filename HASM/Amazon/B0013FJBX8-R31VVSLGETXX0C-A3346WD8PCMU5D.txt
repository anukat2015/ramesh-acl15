Title: Apple MacBook Pro MB470LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop
Content:
I love my Apple MacBook Pro. I am new to mac and I am still getting use to it but I love the new design of this notebook. I do not see any problem with the screen being to shinny, I like it. The dual graphics cards a very nice to. I am waiting on the 4 Gig memory to get here to upgrade it and I do wish I could have afforded the 17" but the 15.4" was expensive enough. But I do like it over all but wish it was a little cheaper.

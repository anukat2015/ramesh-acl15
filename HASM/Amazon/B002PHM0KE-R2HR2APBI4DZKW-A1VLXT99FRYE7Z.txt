Title: Love my little VAIO
Content:
I actually bought this computer from a retail store on black friday (the price was worth the waiting!), but I'm posting a review because of how much I love this thing!
Pros:
FANTASTIC isolated keys keyboard makes for easy typing and a Mac feel.
Screen looks amazing, as do most VAIOs.
Windows 7 
The overall design has a sort of woodgrain finish that gives a classy look and repels fingerprints.
DOES NOT OVERHEAT! This was a huge problem with my old compaq and is it a non-issue here even when playing a DVD.
There is a SD card reader on the front left of the track pad, which is convient.
Instant WEB option is sweet. Just press the web button when the computer is off and LITERALLY in 10 seconds you're online!
Great WIFI card. 
Built in web cam
Cons:
Intel Graphics is not amazing, but HD videos played well and smooth
Battery life is about 2 1/2 hours with regular use
No designated volume buttom
What someone should have told me about this computer:
The track pad has tiny little raised bumps which give it some texture. Very different from most track pads, takes some getting used to but I have found I prefer it to a smooth pad.
Computer come loaded with SONY software which isn't that great or usefull. Good news is if you don't click on it, it doesn't show up very often.
In the end if you like the feel and class of a MAC but don't have 1,200 bucks (or need to run windows) this is a great computer!

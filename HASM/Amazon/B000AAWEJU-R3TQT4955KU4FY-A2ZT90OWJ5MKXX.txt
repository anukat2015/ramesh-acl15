Title: Cute but not powerful enough
Content:
I have had this vacuum for about 3 years now. I wanted to love it so much (especially considering the price!) but my final verdict is: Disappointing. Pros: Elegant design, lightweight, easily maneuverable, works great on hard wood floors, quiet operation so as not to scare the pets. 
Cons: TINY dust bags CONSTANTLY need replacement and are EXPENSIVE. Doesn't have enough power to really clean carpet (even with $129 addition of Turbo Brush), doesn't do a good job on pet hair on couch. 
So in the end I have to say it is not the vacuum of my dreams, and I will not be purchasing another of this type. Maybe next time I'll try one of those Dyson contraptions, if I can afford it.

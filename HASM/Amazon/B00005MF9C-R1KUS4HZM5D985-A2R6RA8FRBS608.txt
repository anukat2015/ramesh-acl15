Title: A somewhat satisfied customer dreams of more...
Content:
This coffee maker is great in that it fits easily onto small kitchen counters and it does indeed have a permanent filter. Permanent filters are a nice plus--you don't have to go running around to several different stores to find the right size filter for your make of coffee maker. It cleans very quickly with soap and water or in a dishwasher, too. 
The thermos mug is also very well constructed for such an inexpensive model. It also fits neatly into a car beverage holder--another plus!
However, maybe I got a lemon when I picked this out, because the coffee it made was never once hot on all the occasions I ever used it--merely warm. When I'm first starting my day I really like my cup of coffee hot. This goes double in the coldest months when it counts to have a nice hot start to your day.
Overall, either I bought a lemon just by bad luck or this coffee maker should be better constructed so as to make a truly hot cup of coffee! It's a great coffee maker for people on a budget; and it's great also for people who prefer warm coffee without having to wait for the coffee to cool down. But for me personally I was somewhat disappointed.

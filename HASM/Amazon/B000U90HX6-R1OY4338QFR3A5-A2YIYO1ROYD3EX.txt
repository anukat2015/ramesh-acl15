Title: Lasko Room Heaters
Content:
I was a little disappointed in the Lasko Heater I last ordered.  It wasn't the model I was expecting.  The previous order of a Lasko room heater was very satisfying.  It had remoted control and an ion generator.  This last one had neither of these features.  Maybe I made a mistake but the image of the one I order was exactly like the first one so I naturally assumed I would receive the same heater.  I don't believe this last one has the BTU output as the first one.  I am using it as it does serve my purposes, but, I am absolutely elated with the first one I received.  I have never seen a heater of that size put out as much heat as the first one.  It actually heats my whole house and I have a 2 story house.

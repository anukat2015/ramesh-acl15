Title: Flips breaker
Content:
I bought this a few weeks ago and have had trouble with it tripping the breakers.  Our home was built in the late 70's, and I'm not an electrician so I don't know what our amps are for our breaker box.  I've tried it in different areas hoping to find a circuit that will allow it to work without trouble.  But if I forget I have it on and turn on another appliance, then it's lights out.  I will probably return it and look for something that has lower wattage.

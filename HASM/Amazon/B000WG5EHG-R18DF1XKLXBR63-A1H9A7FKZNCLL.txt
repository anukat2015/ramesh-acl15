Title: Buggy Bugger?
Content:
I bought this player new a year ago and it worked great for about the first 6 months. One day I plugged the Zune into my computer and kept getting the same error over and over saying that a USB device is not recognized. After going through all the limited steps on the Zune site and finally spending 45 minutes with technical support, it was determined that the problem is hardware related and they said to exchange the Zune for a new one. This has happened with 2 other co-workers who bought this model. And added note: The other two guys exchanged theirs up last year to the Zune 120 and have had no problems.
I bought my defective Zune at a local store, along with the 2 year extended warrantee. Because this particular model has so many issues, they no longer carry this one, or any of the compact model Zunes. I got a store credit and bought the 16G Sony Walkman.

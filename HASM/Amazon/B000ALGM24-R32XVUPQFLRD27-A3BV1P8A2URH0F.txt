Title: Works great, looks nice
Content:
We were replacing our old, original non-programmable thermostat.  We didn't want a touchscreen programmable, so based on previous reviews, I picked this one.  It was bigger than I expected, and doesn't have the lux look of the touch screen models, but it's definitely worth the low price ticket.  Looks decent, programming is very easy, and it's convenient that it doesn't have to be attached to the wall to program.  Lots of settings options which is great because my husband and myself are on very different schedules.  It's such an upgrade from our non-programmable, and so much nicer not having to adjust the temperature manually all the time.  I'm not sure if I would love it as much if I'd had prior experience with a programmable, but this thermostat does the job for us!  Just the fact that I'm not constantly messing with the temperature makes me think we're saving energy, and money.  Great buy for the price.

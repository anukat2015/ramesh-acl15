Title: Hoover  Windtunnel Canister Vac
Content:
Great little vacuum for getting under beds, high up areas like ceiling fans, and cob webs out of corners etc. Like the on/off control on the handle where you hold on to vacuum. Also really like the suction control. Low suction is great for bathroom throw rugs where my upright would just suck them up. Still like my upright best for all over cleaning, tried vacuuming the whole house with the canister and didn't like dragging it all over behind me, but love it as a second vacuum for above mentioned tasks.

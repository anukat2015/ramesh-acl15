Title: Amazing!
Content:
This vacuum left me both amazed and horrified!  I had vacuumed about 5 hours prior to my new vacuum's arrival.  Just for kicks, I tried out my new vacuum upon receipt, and was horrified at the amount of additional hair this picked up!  It is hard to imagine how much better a job one of those expensive Dyson's could really do.  It is self-propelled, which makes it easy to use.  We have two cats and a large dog and this vacuum really does the trick!  Highly recommended!

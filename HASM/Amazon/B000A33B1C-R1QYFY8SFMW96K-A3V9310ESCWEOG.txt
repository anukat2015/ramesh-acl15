Title: This is a great heater
Content:
I bought this heater last year when LP got so expensive. It did a great job. Yes, if you read the manual it tells you to run it on high outside or in ventilated room for 2 hours to burn the smell off, after this mine has no more smell.
These radiator heaters do not heat real fast but once you find the settings that work for your situation and the temp gets up to your preference it stays there. I recommend running a ceiling fan on low speed, blowing up while using this heater and this spreads the warmth much better. This type oil filled heater is very efficient. They do not dry the air out like the fan forced heaters and makes NO sound except for a click when cycling on and off. It's just a slow, smooth, consistent heat that flows off the unit without it getting real hot to the touch.
A few reviews down someone mentioned not having electronics. I found a model real similar to this one on the Delonghi website that has electronics and a remote and it automatically switches between off, low, med & high setting based on the temperature difference which saves energy. I bought 2 more of this model. I heat the entire 1800 square foot house with these 3 heaters and ceiling fans. I have yet to turn on the central heat, doubt I will all year. I will report back once I get my electric bill next month. It could not possibly be as much as the LP bill would be. 
I recommend this heater and the model with the electronics.

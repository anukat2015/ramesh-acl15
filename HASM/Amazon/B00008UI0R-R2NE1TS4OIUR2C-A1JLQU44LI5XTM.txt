Title: great little vacuum
Content:
I have a pup who sheds like crazy.  This vacuum gets up every last bit of his hair embedded in the rugs with no problem.  It is extremely powerful and the attachments are great for floors, carpets, and furniture.  Definitely worth the money.  The only downside I have found is that the cannister has to be empied after each use and the filter has to be cleaned frequently, which is a little annoying.

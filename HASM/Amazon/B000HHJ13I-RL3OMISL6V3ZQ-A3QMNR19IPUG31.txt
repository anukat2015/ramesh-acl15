Title: Soleus LX-140 portable air conditioner
Content:
I have had the LX-140 for a few months now.  I live in a 700 square foot apartment.  While my apartment is MUCH larger than the BTU rating on the unit, the LX-140 has proven itself to be a great work horse in cooling my apartment.  Since a BTU rating of 12,000 BTU is only expected to properly cool about 450 square feet, I have been amazed at how cold the LX-140 has gotten my place.  With the fact that the unit can be programmed to shut down and start up when you want it to (a great power saver, and comfort feature) I would HIGHLY recommend this unit to anyone who is seriously looking for a reliable machine that will meet their needs.  While I cannot say that if you put the LX-140 in a oversized room, it will always cool it to your liking, I can say with great confidence that placed in a 450 square foot place it would do VERY well.

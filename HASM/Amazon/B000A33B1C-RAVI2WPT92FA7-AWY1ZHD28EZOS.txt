Title: The Dragon is perfect for our needs.
Content:
We use two of these in our finished basement. They heat up fast and the bad smell burns off after an hour or two. The room is always comfortable and the electric bill isn't through the roof. We picked up another for the living room which seems to have a cold spot and it keeps the temp comfortable in there as well.

Title: High quality product with some shortcomings
Content:
It hardly needs to be said that Apple computers are superior and, consequently, one expects a great deal from them.  The MacBook is certainly a significant upgrade from its predecessors.  As compared to the iBook, it is physically a great improvement, thinner, lighter even, despite the wide screen, nifty magnetic power attachment, better catch, more solid keyboard, and there are numerous software features itemized in the product description and other reviews.  However, I should like to point out several flaws in the MacBook, which, though not serious, are important enough for me to rate the product with only four stars, even though I love it and think it's great.  These are:
1.  The bottom edge of the MacBook is quite sharp unlike that of the iBook, which was smoothly rounded.  When you rest your palms on it it to use the trackpad, it is not at all comfortable.
2. The high gloss screen may be nice, but if you are using the computer seated in a chair with a reading light behind you, there is an annoying glare. 
3. I have had trouble with uncontrolled scrolling, the thing fairly frequently takes off wildly on its own.  I never had this problem with the iBook; perhaps it's only a flaw in my particular MacBook.
4. I have a problem with AppleWorks freezing frequently, although it unfreezes if you press "save".  Nevertheless, I never had this occur with the iBook.
5.  Lastly, one might expect the MacBook to load faster than the iBook.  Sorry, it just doesn't; if anything it loads a trifle slower.  This is perhaps a reason for buying the more expensive model.
These complaints are not major and there are so many advantageous features to the MacBook, including price, that I nevertheless strongly recommend it. --- By the way I encourage the user to try the really great speech feature; let your Mac read a book to you from Text Edit or from the Adobe Acrobat Reader. (You can download free practically every classic you can think of from [...]) I am totally in love with the Vicki MacInTalk synthetic voice!

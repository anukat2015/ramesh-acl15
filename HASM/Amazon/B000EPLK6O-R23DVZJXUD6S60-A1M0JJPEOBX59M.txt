Title: Cuppa Joe Anyone?
Content:
If the quality of the merchandise and the cup of coffee are important to you, buy this little guy!  I'll never buy another $15 drip coffee machine. I love this coffee pot to the point where I neurotically think about my coffee all the time now!  It has a built in charcol filter and we feed it RO water and Dunkin' Donnuts coffee.  The result is a very happy old man!  It is easy to use and clean and it will accept one of the golden filters,  Ah! Life is good!

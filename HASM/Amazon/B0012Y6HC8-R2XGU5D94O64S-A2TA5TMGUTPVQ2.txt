Title: GOOD CAMERA, A LITLE EXPENSIVE.......4 STARS
Content:
I got this camera 3 weeks ago and have taken about 800 pics  , I have to say that the first 500 were not really good, this camera is very good if you know how to use it, it takes a litle while to learn about settings flash, and stuff, also if you want to take beter shots you need to get an extra lens, other than 18-55mm i got canon 70-200 f/4 L wich is really good for zoomed pics, good and beter definition, you also need to get  an uv filter to avoid  overexp., when sunny days dont be surprised if your pics come up very lighted, you always have to adjust your settings, speccially iso, and exp. , and never get shots under basic zone when very sunny, camera has defult settings and you wont be able to change those settings, and pics will come up over exp. i use P mode and lower exp, also iso will be set at 100 or 200,,, overall I'm happy with it, if you wanna see some pics just check the samples on this webpaga amazon.com  on your right side of camera description says  users pictures or something, click on  the most recently added or  check them all, when you find a bratz pic, thats me, two pics next to bratz, and 3 before bratz, total five, thanks so much and happy hollidays

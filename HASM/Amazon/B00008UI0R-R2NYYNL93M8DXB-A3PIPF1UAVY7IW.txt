Title: It's OK
Content:
This vacuum is excellent for small rooms, but if you have a lot of spaces to clean get ready to clean the filter more than once each time. It is silence compare to our old vacuum, but don't expect to carry out a conversion while vacuuming. I like the fact that all controls are built right on the handle, e.g. off, on, floor or carpet option button, etc. You can go from carpet to hard floor with ease.
I didn't expect the filter to be as small as it is, I guess pictures are deceiving, but it's easy to clean. If you want to prevent dust from getting deep inside the filter canister's grooves you can wrap a cloth around the filter. Make sure not to use heavy cloth because it might prevent airflow through the filter. Dryer sheets like Bounce work great as they can allow excellent air flow and add a scent to the room.

Title: Like a toy without batteries
Content:
I'm a longstanding fan of Minolta and this model does not disappoint.  It is, however, immensly complicated so be prepared.
A WARNING: Minolta always in past models included a memory card all be it a small one.  It is NOT included in this package and you must buy one (a 1 GB runs a bit less than $100 additional).  What a let down to unpack and set up the camera and not be able to use it until the next day after a trip to a local camera store.

Title: Buddy Propane Heater
Content:
Yeah, it gets cold in Hawaii too.  (Down to mid-lower 40s at the higher elevations during the winter.)  The Buddy Propane Heater takes some of the chill out of the early morning air while waiting for the coffee to brew.  It's a portable space heater about the size of a small, FAT briefcase, easy to light, (nearly) odorless but this heater is only a little less expensive to run than an electric space heater if you don't have an inexpensive propane fuel source....  Definitely not for heating up a large area.

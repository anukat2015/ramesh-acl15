Title: OK, but my son told me this was the same as my Apple
Content:
This has been a fine machine for men now that my MacIntosh computer is no longer working. I thought the screen and mouse were different than the Apple, so I was not totally surprised that this machine is made by Microsoft. Well, I guess it is like my new Kia which is actually better than my old Honda, and that really surprised me. I took my son's advice in both matters and for the time being he appears to be right as usual. I limit his advice to technical matters, though. His taste in just about everything else from music to clothing could stand improvement. I'll give both Arnold and this machine five stars, though.

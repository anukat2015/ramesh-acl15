Title: Quiet, portable heat
Content:
Pretty good space heater! If you like those "satellite dish" radiant heaters but are worried about them tipping over and you are annoyed by that metal rattling sound you inevitably get, this heater is for you. It's so quiet I often forget to turn it off! Using a mica panel means this thing works similar to ceramic heaters, but it's supposed to be better technology. Very quiet and works as advertised. As some have noted, the heater gives off a noticeable gas-like smell the first few times you use it, but it seems to go away with use.
Features
It has two power settings, though I can't tell a huge difference between the two. It comes with screw-on rolling feet (as pictured), or you can wall-mount it. It is pretty stable with the rolling feet attached, I have two young kids and no tipping over or burning incidents yet (I believe it has an auto-off feature if it is knocked over). There is a "handle" indentation on the back of the unit near the top so you can grab it and go.
Pros
-Very light (&lt; 10 lbs) so it really is portable
-Large heating surface means a pretty large warm spot in front of it
Cons
-Takes a while to heat up any significant space beyond the area in front of the grill (like most heaters)
-Does get pretty hot to the touch after a while
-Power cord is slightly short, but not a big problem

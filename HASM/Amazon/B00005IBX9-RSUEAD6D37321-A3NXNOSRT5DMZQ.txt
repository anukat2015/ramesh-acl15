Title: Makes Great Coffee -- Just A Few Flaws
Content:
I drink 5 or 6 cups of coffee a day and really enjoy a good cup.  I've owned this for almost 2 weeks, and my husband and I have been very happy with the coffee this brews.   My complaints are minor.  As many people have mentioned, it is a bit awkward to pour water into the well.  The "steps" for reading the number of cups of water you are pouring are difficult to read.  You need to first measure using the carafe, which isn't a big deal.  My biggest complaint is with the carafe itself.  The lid needs to snap in.  Twice I have not done that and had a bit of a spill. I also noticed that the one time I tried to grab a cup of coffee before it finished brewing, I did have some leakage.  All in all, though, I am happy with this purchase.

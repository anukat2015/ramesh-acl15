Content:
I am a Mom of 2 young ones, and have a very large house.  I purchased this vacuum so that I could vacuum the majority of the house in a short amount of time. Other canister vacuums got in my way,didn't follow well and I grew tired of dragging around the bulk of uprights. I like this one because it is light weight, comfortable to carry on my back, and has a very strong suction.(I bought the carpet attachment)  It does a fantastic job and I can knock out the job in a short amount of time. I have a fettish for vacuum cleaners and this is by far the best one yet.

Title: Disappointed with price
Content:
I found out that I could have bought a laptop with better specs at a lower price. I would expect Amazon to do a better job of policing prices charged by their sellers. Also, I did not realize that Dell would not provide any guarantee or technical support since the laptop was not purchased directly from Dell. Dell's records showed that the laptop was sold to Best Buy - so it seems that the seller bought it from Best Buy and resold through Amazon - at a substantial markup. And since the hard drive broke down within two weeks, I also wonder if the seller bought a refurbished laptop from Best Buy and passed it on as new. Amazon needs to police their sellers.

Title: BAD
Content:
I purchased this heater for my daugther's new place in Santa Monica California where is very cold this time of year. She was able to use it for a whole two weeks and because she was not planning on return it and lives in a small apartment, discarded the box. What do I do now with a silver and black accesory that you can't even use as an ash tray?

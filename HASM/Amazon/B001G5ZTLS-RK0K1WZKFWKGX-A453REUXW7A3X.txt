Title: Great camera if you need the horsepower and have the $
Content:
I'm a very serious amateur photographer, and have been shooting Canon digital cameras since 2003. I purchased the 5D Mark II to replace my trusty 20D. Waited out the 40D, 50D, and 5D to get just the right camera, and from my time shooting today, it was worth the wait and premium over the crop cameras.  I justified the additional cost this way: Rather than spending another $1,200 on a 16-35 lens that would yield ~26-48mm on the crop camera, I spent it on the 5D, which also gets me video capability. I can now get full use of my 24-105 for wide angle, and that lens really shines on this camera.  My 70-200 is much more useful for closer quarters as well.  I'm thankful that Canon didn't get the 50D right (sorry 50D buyers, but that's my opinion), as it forced my hand on this camera.
Pros: 
* Focus seems faster and more accurate than my 20D, which I'm sure could use some adjusting after 40K images. I've found myself letting the 5D select the focus points more often, which I never did on my 20D (focus center, frame shot, shoot).  I see no reason for any more focus points than it has for the type of shooting I do, but then I've never used a 1 series (Lord help me if I do).
* Screen -- simply amazing when moving up from 20D
* Viewfinder -- beautiful, bright, almost total coverage vs. looking through a cave in the crop cameras
* Image Quality -- Wow. High ISO, low noise. Easily 3 stops better than my 20D. Have only shot a few raw shots (24MB!!!), and will be doing some comparison tonight. JPEG in camera looks amazing, and they aren't displayed with noise reduction in camera. 
* Build -- very solid, great shutter sound, buttons where they belong
* Usability -- highly usable menus, adjustments, modes -- if you've shot Canon before, no surprises here
* Fixed small things, like when you accidentally go from Play to shooting, or close the view, it takes you back to the last picture you viewed vs. making you start over (reference 20D -- maybe this is fixed on others since then as well)
* Battery -- seems like they beefed it up appropriately for the large screen & live-view needs
Cons:
* Huge file sizes -- Better buy an external disk array for storage. I don't (and most people don't) really need 21 MP -- 15 beautiful MP would be better (imagine the high ISO IQ if they didn't push this to 21MP to stay in the race with Sony & Nikon!).  I'm experimenting using the Medium setting (about 11 MP) to see if IQ is as good proportional to size. That will be much more usable file size for most work.
* Nits on custom functions -- settings don't save unless you "Menu" back out after selecting them
* Current cost of second battery (swear they were $79 a month ago, now $145!!!)
I can't comment much on video yet, but have used enough to say that it isn't terribly practical to the average shooter. You shouldn't even consider that this is going to replace a HD camcorder for family shooting (though you may still get away with trying to justify this to your non-photography-buff spouse). I didn't buy it for the video, so I'm not going into detail on that.
Bottom line:
Amazing camera if you can afford it. Looking forward to putting 100K images through it in its lifetime.  Hope I can afford the storage!  Lemme know if you bought the battery grip and it is too big for your hands -- that is my next purchase.

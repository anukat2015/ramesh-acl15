Title: Performs Well but has Safety Issues
Content:
Pros
- Small and lightweight
- Outputs heat surprisingly well
- Inexpensive
Cons
- The overheat protection seems to take longer than it should to go into effect. I'm very concerned about the safety of the device since it doesn't have a timer, remote, or ability to set the device to a specific temperature. (I have returned the device due to safety concerns).
- Uses substantial amount of electricity on 1500 watt setting
- Slightly too loud on 1500 watt setting

Title: BEWARE - Sharp corners, bad hand position ruined this purchase
Content:
I decided it was time to replace my 4 year old Macbook Pro 15" for a snazzy new unibody 15" Macbook Pro.
Spent alot of time at the Apple store checking them out (ultimately a bad environment for this!) before I decided on a new 15" - then ordered it from Amazon.
Of all things I never thought it would be the design of an Apple that would make me return it.
Once i got it home and started using it I noticed that the lower top front aluminum edges of the keyboard part of the machine where you rest your hands are pretty sharp and have no give - feels like a hardened machined car part.  It wasnt long before i noticed my lower palm start to hurt like i was pressing against a dull knife.  Full disclosure - i have big hands (not huge) so the positioning just didnt work for me, though others may have no problem with it.
In addition I asked my wife to try it just to make sure i wasnt making too much of it.  When she went to put her hands down operate the track pad she was lightly stabbed (no blood or anything) on the small corners of the indent where you lift the lid.  Its that sharp!!!
Add to that the glossy screen which REALLY REFLECTS outside lighting/shadows and I new it I couldn't keep it (not for $1800 purchase price!!!)
Its a real bummer as all the new Apple models except the low end white one have the same issues - Im not a PC guy anymore so Im not sure what I'm going to buy now.  Hackintosh anyone???
Bummed.

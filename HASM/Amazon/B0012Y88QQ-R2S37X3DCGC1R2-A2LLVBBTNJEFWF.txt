Title: *****Not to Shabby******
Content:
I thought the quality of the Xti and Xsi wouldn't differ much in image quality but the Xsi does have a slight improvement. Previously when I owned the Xti, I was happy and satisfied with it, but today when I recieved my Xsi, I was just amaze at how it gives me a totally new feel. The grip is better and the screen is pretty big. The ISO button is in a awkard spot but nonetheless it is a fine camera. Recommended. 
Amazon also did a great job at sending this item to me with the 1 day service.

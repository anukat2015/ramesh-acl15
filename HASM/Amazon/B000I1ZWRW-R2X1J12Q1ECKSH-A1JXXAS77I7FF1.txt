Title: The Canon Digital Rebel XTi Reviewed!
Content:
As soon as we got our hands on it we were amazed at Canons improvements. Our Canon review panel have tested every function, every mode and evey setting of the Canon Digital Rebel XTi in the hope that we could provide you with a balanced and objective review, yet to our frustration all we came up with is that the Digital Rebel XTi is a very similar but much better quality camera than the Digital Rebel XT. Although despite its modest dimensions, Canon has stuck with the traditional Compact Flash memory card format for the XTi model.
You won't be shocked to find that Digital Rebel XTi features an oversized 2.5 inch screen & boasts Canon's Picture Styles function. The XTi also inherited the previous Canon 30D's nine-point AF system. However, instead of using the proven 8 MP sensor found in its predecessor, the XT model, Canon has this time developed a fa superior 10.1 MP CMOS sensor! This makes the Digital Rebel XTi the highest resolution D-SLR camera with an EF-S lens mount to date! 
The advanced features make the Canon XTi a significantly better upgraded model than was expected, also placing Canon's entry-level D-SLR above its own higher end EOS 30D! So, we happily award the new EOS 400D a '5 Star' rating and believe it's a feasible competitor to Sony's new 'Alpha 100'. The Xti is certainly a hot addition to the Canon 'Digital Rebel' SLR range. In short, if you liked the previous Canon Digital Rebel XT, you'll undoubtedly be thrilled with the Canon Digital Rebel XTi.

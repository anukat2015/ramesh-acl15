Title: Carafe leaked on day one
Content:
Seal between the carafe and plastic spout were not adequately glued together. Disappointing and now have to deal with getting a replacement after 1 week of use. Coffee brewed fine but overall the unit is somewhat flimsy.I'd expect 1-2 years max before one of the plastic hinges would fail.

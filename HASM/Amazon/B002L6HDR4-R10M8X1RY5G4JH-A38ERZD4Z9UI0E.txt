Title: Loved it until an external speaker problem came to be
Content:
I have had several iPods and basically all worked quite well.  This one worked fine until this week.  Now suddenly when I have the headphones plugged in (yes they are plugged in completely, )the external speaker stays on.  I tried different headphones and have the same problem.  I read on another site that others have had the same problem, and there is no fix.  I don't know about the no fix, but I will find out.  I am not close to an Apple store, so I will need to call them.

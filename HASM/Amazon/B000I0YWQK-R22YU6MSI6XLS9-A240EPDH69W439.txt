Title: Broke after only 2 months
Content:
Brought this heater a couple of months ago.  Initially it worked great, and could heat up a small room in about 1/2 hour or so.  But now when I leave it on for about 15 minutes, it makes a strange noise and I can smell smoke coming out of the device.  For $50+, that's a lot of money wasted.

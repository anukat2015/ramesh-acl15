Title: Sansa 4GB player
Content:
I wanted a player to use with a music service like Rhapsody or URGE, found the Sansa line and I am happy to say that since purchasing the e260 I have never been disappointed.  Granted I am renting the tracks from Rhapsody but I can purchase songs from .89 to .99.
I think this is a great and economical alternative to IPOD, which to tell you the truth I think is just yuppie hype.  I borrowed for several weeks my friends IPOD and found it nice to use but, it occasionally froze and sitting there transfering my CD's to the player was not only time consuming but tedious(at last count I have 450 plus albums).  I was doing just as good with my Sony Mini Disk player and got better quality sound.  And living in NYC carrying an IPOD can be a hazzard to your health.
The Sansa was cheaper, has all the features of the IPOD and has an expandable memory slot with an FM radio for when you want to listen to games, news, Opie and Anthony etc.  It uses the Rhapsody Music Service which basically lets you "rent" songs or purchase tracks that you save to your computer or CD.  They even include album art and facts that you can print and put into your jewel cases.
To this day I am still very happy with my Sansa, they only thing that is a down fall to it is a lack of good accessories.  It does not use all IPOD accessories and there seems to be a limited amount of after market accessories but hopefully with the growing popularity of Rhapsody they will start putting out stuff.

Title: Terrible product
Content:
Bought first one, worked great for about 3 weeks, looked good.  I really liked the soft heat without a fan.  It stopped working properly, thermostat wouldn't go past the minimum setting.  I exchanged it for another.  Second one lasted 3 days and stopped working.  I will not buy anything from this mfr. again.DeLonghi HR715 Retro Convection Heater

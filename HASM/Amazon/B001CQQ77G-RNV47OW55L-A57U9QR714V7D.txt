Title: great heat and warm ambiance
Content:
This heater has been a great purchase, especially considering the price.  I like the soft gray color instead of the stark black that most stoves are painted, and the size is not too small or large.  The warm air really blasts out of the stove when on high, so this unit has been very useful for heating.  I liked the look of burning coals better than logs which is why I chose this unit, and that was right on--they are very realistic.  The only negative is the bright, lighted background is not realistic at all.  It is overly bright, and the arch of light is very defined, and there are strips of paper blowing in the light that look halloweeny.  If I could find in a lower watt bulb, that may help to reduce the brightness and definition.  Ultimately, no electric stove will fool anyone looking closely, so this one is as real looking as any and the heating power is second to none.
Also, shipping was amazingly fast.  We live in massachusetts, and recieved this item about 2 days after we ordered it.

Title: A good vacuum and very good for the money
Content:
After owning a Hoover for a long time I went through a whole bunch of vacuums. First, an expensive Panasonic upright. The Panasonic was a disaster - it fit poorly together, destroyed a rug, but it sucked...it really did. Then a couple of cheap vacuums: a Eureka and something else. Not bad for the money. Each lasted about a year. Still junk though better than the Panasonic.
Then, I bought this. Well made. Works well enough on carpets and wood floors. Good attachments. And easy to use and store.  Maybe, not the perfect vacuum but a bargain for $120 or so. Excellent value.

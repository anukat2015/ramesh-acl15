Title: Great alternative for discerning drinkers
Content:
First impression is that I'm really digging it. The selling point for me was retaining the ability to use any ground coffee in this machine. They sell an accessory filter that you fill with two tablespoons of your favorite ground coffee and it brews a perfect cup. 
The wife had a cup of hot chocolate immediately afterwards and said it tasted great. My travel mug holds 16 ounces of caffeine bliss. The Keurig has three cup size settings and I can fill my travel mug with two button presses. The clearance under the fill spout is 7.25 inches, so it should fit nearly any size mug out there. 
The three mug sizes are 5.25oz, 7.25oz and 9.25oz. Using only one K-cup inserted, I press the 9.25oz followed by the 5.25oz size for a near-perfect fill and brew strength in my travel mug. 
The 48oz water reservoir on the side is a great feature, as the Keurig keeps water hot and ready all the time if you choose that option. It literally takes about 30 seconds to make a full cup of coffee. 
For those discerning (wierd) people that don't drink coffee, it brews a perfect cup of hot tea, or hot cocoa with zero mess. 
The only nitpick I have with it is the pump sound when it refills the heater reservoir w/ water. It's a little loud and vibrates some, but it does not last for long. Well worth the money paid for what we wanted. 
Each K-cup costs about .50 cents if bought online. The special pod for using regular grounds was $14.99, but it will pay for itself by using any coffee I choose. Now, if Starbucks would just start making K-cups, I'd be set!

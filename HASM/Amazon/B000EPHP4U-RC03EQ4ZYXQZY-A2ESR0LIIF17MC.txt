Title: What a fun machine.
Content:
I have never owned an ipod (and still don't since I bought this one for a girlfriend), but now I see why everyone loves them so much.
Pros
1. easy to load an unload songs
2. long battery life (24hrs)
Cons
1. bought the pink one so I couldn't just keep it myself and get my girl something else.

Title: Hoover Bagless Vacuum
Content:
I really like this vacuum.  It does a great job of getting up the dog hair from my carpets and wood floors---which was my #1 priority when choosing a vacuum.  I love the controls on the handle---on my old canister I always had to go back to the canister to turn it on or off.  Having the power levels on the handle is also great.  There's only one thing I'm not crazy about ---that is emptying the container when it's full---but that's part of having a bagless vacuum-- it's definitely worth it when I see what a great job the vacuum has done.

Title: Wonderful...So far.
Content:
Wow! This is a great product. Granted I just opened it yesterday but have already uploaded 439 songs and they all play beautifully. I love this gadget! It's small enough to fit in my coin pocket on my jeans (the little one in the top portion of a 5 pocket pair) and rests perfectly in the palm of my hand. iTunes was nice and easy to use as well. I'm very pleased with what Apple's come up with, at least so far. I bought it to (a get rid of the hassel of all of my CDs, cases, players, headphones, and batteries....oh the money that I've spent on batteries! and (b to help introduce myself to other realms of music without having to buy CD-R and burn songs. It may sound silly, but I think it will be a lot easier to experience other types and I'm really excited about expanding my musical world. So exciting!!!

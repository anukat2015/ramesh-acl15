Title: The best 70 bucks I've ever spent!!!
Content:
Hello Everyone,
This being my first espresso machine ever, I can honestly say I absolutely love it! Say goodbye to Starbucks and all those other name brand coffee's. Once you start making your own at home, nothing else will taste the same. A few tips that I've learned with this machine:
1. Get rid of that useless rubber tube. It is much easier to use and clean with out it
2. Have your beans ground fresh and fairly fine and keep them stored in a sealed container. Make sure to use the proper serving, but pack it really tight...trust me this works!
3. Froth your milk first before running the espresso. The steam may take a bit longer to get going than the hot water. I usually pack in my beans, then froth the milk to about 165-170 degrees (make  sure the milk is cold before starting to froth), then run the espresso.
4. Frothing milk takes practice, so don't be discouraged if you don't get it right the first time
5. Buy a small stainless steal canter with a thermostat to froth your milk. I picked mine up at Target
Also, keep a clean wet rag or paper towel near by to clean the steam nozzle after frothing, it'll get baked on very quickly!
I've worked in fine dinning for a long time , so I've gotten pretty good at making espresso.
For those of you thinking of getting a starter or a mid range espresso machine....this is a winner!!!

Title: SPT SF-608R Cooler is excellent!
Content:
We've moved to a very hot & dry area & everyone here is telling me how sweltering hot it gets during summers.  They say my electric bill will sky-rocket by 3 fold!  This SPT SF-608R Portable Evaporative Cooler has been a great investment so far.  I'm still waiting for the temps to get well above the 100 degree mark to see how well this unit really fares.  I can barely wait til it gets really hot!  So far, the times we have used it have been SO comfortable.  The cooler has easily kept us cool on 90+ degree nights.  We've actually had to turn it off in the middle of the night b/c it got us TOO cold!  And, we haven't used it beyond it's lowest setting so far!  Now, we use the convenient timer.  It's quiet & barely noticed in the room.  And, there's no strange odors like you may have heard.  With 15% humidity, it should lower 100+ degree temps by almost 30 degrees.  That's fine by me.  Just remember to allow for a decent cross breeze & ventilation.  I'm confident we'll save hundreds of dollars in these summer months, and our cooler should pay for itself in no time.

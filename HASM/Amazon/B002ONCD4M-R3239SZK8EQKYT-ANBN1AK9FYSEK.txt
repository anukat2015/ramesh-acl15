Title: Good deal, a couple of drawbacks
Content:
Purchased the DV6-1350US.
Pros:
Price seems to change weekly on Amazon, but if you can get it at the lower price, it is a good deal.
Design, features, speed are all good.
Windows 7, so far so good.
Battery life good with extended battery.
Cons:
Extended battery sticks out of the bottom and makes it a little more bulky.
No firewire port (for this model).

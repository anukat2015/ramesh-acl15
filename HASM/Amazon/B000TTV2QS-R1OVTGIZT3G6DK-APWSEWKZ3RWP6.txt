Title: A great buy
Content:
I did a lot of research before I bought a space heater on Amazon. My central air is very expensive to run, and I wanted something to keep me warm at my computer, where I spend most of my nights.
After reading many reviews, I learned that it is best to get a heater that is ceramic, oscillates and has different heat or fan settings. I could not find a heater with these items that also was UL listed and anywhere close to my budget, so I bought this one.
It's perfect for me. It keeps me warm at the computer. Once I'm at my desired temperature, I turn it down and feel pleasantly warm afterward. The buttons do beep a little loudly, but it doesn't matter to me because I don't use this to sleep. The fan itself is quiet. The handle at the back makes it safe and easy to move the heater from next to my desk to in front of the couch. The cord is a good length, too.
If you're looking for a heater to keep you company while you work, this is the one.

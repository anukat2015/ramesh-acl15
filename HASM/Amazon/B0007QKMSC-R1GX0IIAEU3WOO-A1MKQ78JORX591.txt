Title: All that I had imagined...
Content:
This is my first SLR (a digital one nonetheless) and it is spectacular.  I rarely go anywhere without it.  The packaged lense is superb, as are the resolution of my chrystal clear photographs and the user friendly controls.  I am an avid backpacker and enjoy taking photographs of the scenery.  The light weight of this camera is a must when ounces count, however, quality is in no way sacrificed for this featherlight DSLR.  
My only gripe would be with the relatively small LCD screen size.  To add balance to the world, you are able to zoom in a great deal to pick up those subtle little naunces that could turn your photo-fresco into a photo-fiasco.  
Overall, this is one DSLR that is a must have.  Thanks Canon. :)

Title: What a bargain!
Content:
I just purchased the Rebel T1i as a backup camera for my EOS 40D, and I find I am using it more and more as my main camera.  It's smaller, lighter, has more megapixels, and shoots movies, too.  It's really closer to the 50D in performance than the 40D, but for a lot less money than either one. Unless you need 6.5 fps shooting of the 50D and a few features that the T1i lacks, this camera is the better bet.

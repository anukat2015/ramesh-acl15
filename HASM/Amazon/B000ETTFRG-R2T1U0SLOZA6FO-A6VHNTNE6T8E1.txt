Title: Great MP3 player, few minor problems
Content:
The e270 is the 6 GB model in the SanDisk Sansa e200 series of MP3 players.  Possible Capacities are 2, 4, 6, and 8 GBs, beyond the capacity differences the e200 series are identical.
Pros
-Fairly Inexpensive
-Better Sound Quality than previous SanDisk MP3 players
-Up to 2 GBs of memory expansion via MicroSD card (4 GB MicroSD cards are not available and it is unknown if they will be compatible)
-FM Radio
-Displays Pictures and plays video
-Fast sync time
Cons
-Proprietary USB connection
-Easy finger print magnet
-Screen is ok, not great
-Crappy headphones included
The screen is a nice display, it looks good for being on such a small device, but it is not as nice looking as some of the Hard Drive based MP3 players such as the iPod.  Unlike most MP3 players this one has a memory expansion slot, a very nice addition.  The headphones which are supplied are pretty crappy, but when are headphones included with the MP3 player ever good?  The music quality is very good, obviously  the encoding is extremely important, but the Sansa sounds better than my old Dell Pocket DJ.  Proprietary Ports suck, but the proprietary USB cable is included.  In order to put pictures or video on the Sansa they have to go through the media converter.  Pictures and video can only be stored on the actual Sansa, not a MicroSD card. As of right now the e200 series supports MicroSD cards up to 2 GBs, there are 4 GB MicroSD cards on the horizion, but as of right now it is unknown if they will be compatible with the e200 series. The drawbacks are very minor, if it was possible to give 4.5 stars I would.  Definetly reccommended.

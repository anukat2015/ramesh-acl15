Title: Product is so bad I had to write a review
Content:
My purchase of this product turned into a nightmare.  I bought the product because it was a Consumer Reports "best buy".  After using it 2 or 3 times, something broke in the rug attachment.  I called the brand's customer service number and the automated system provided names of 2 repair facilities.  One never returned my call and the other said they couldn't help me after telling me on the phone that they could and to bring the vacuum in.  I called customer service a second time to speak to a rep who gave me two additional names of service centers to call.  Both said they only dealt with central vac systems.  I called a third time to see how I could return the product because there didn't appear to be any service options in my city.  I was given the name of yet another service center.  I told her I just wanted to return the item and she asked if I had tried changing the belt.  I was incredulous.  Why would I try that after owning the product for a month?  There were no return options so I tried the 5th service center.  This one was able to help me, but told me it might be a month before the part came in because the company was slow to ship.  In the course of my desperate search for service, I found out that the vacuum is really a "Eureka", not a true Electrolux like some higher-end models.  Now that I've used the "repaired" vacuum a few more times, the motor already sounds like it's getting louder and clanky. I'm sure I'll be replacing it as soon as the warranty period expires.  My experience with this product and company has been frustrating, disappointing and a horrible waste of time.  It's definitely been one of the worst purchases I've ever made.  Stay away!

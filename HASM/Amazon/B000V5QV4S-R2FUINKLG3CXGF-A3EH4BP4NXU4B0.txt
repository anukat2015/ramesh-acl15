Title: Canon EOS 40D is a great camera!!
Content:
I've had a number of 35MM SLR's in the past and more recently a number of point and shot digital cameras. So I decided it was time to step up and get a Digital SLR. I'd been waiting for the Rebel XSi to come out thinking I'd get one of those since it was less expensive. But for a few dollars more I was able to get the 40D with a great Image Stabalized 28-135mm lens (which you need to multiply the zoom level by ~1.6 to compare to a 35mm equivelent lens since the 40D's CCD is smaller than a 35mm frame). You get a faster shutter speed, better ISO rating, more frames per second in burst mode, and it's more weatherproof. Yes a few less pixels but in reality unless you are printing something larger that 8"x12" that is not really a factor. So the 40D, at it's price point, is one of the most capable camera's on the market in my opinion. And I'd buy it again anyday. I've been very impressed so far and, while I hate to admit it, my ability is now the limiting factor with my photo's not the camera!!

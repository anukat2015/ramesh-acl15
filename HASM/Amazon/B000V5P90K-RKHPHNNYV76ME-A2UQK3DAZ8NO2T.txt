Title: Fine camera, not the right lens choice for most.
Content:
[I'm not going to review this kit here, as I have an early hands-on review posted for body only.  This concerns this kit lens].
Unfortunately, Canon has decided to include the 28-135 initially as the only kit lens.  While not a bad performer, this older, made for 35mm design, is not a good match for the high performance 40D.
The 1.6 crop factor of the 40D makes the 28mm unacceptable to most for a wide angle solution.  Thus, you'll probably have to drop down additional money in the future for a wider-angle lens.  Although it costs more, the 17-85 IS is a very good solution that will give the majority of shooters all the wide angle they will need.  Yes, it falls short of the 135mm range, but that length, too, is probably not enough range at the top; therefore, you'd have to expect to buy 2 additional lenses.
The one attractive feature of the 28-135 is the price.  Canon's definately taking a hit, trying to reduce their supply of this lens.  But by the time you read this, you might be able to get the just as afforable, new for digital, EF-S 18-55 IS.  This will help at the wide side, allowing you to put your additional money in the telephoto.
Of course, if money is no object, look at the 17-55 f2.8 IS, or one of the many "L" series.

Title: iPod Shuffle 2 gig
Content:
This iPod fits the bill for use during casual activities, i.e. jogging, walking, general sports activities where there really is no need for a video screen to view. The clip-on feature is really handy as it eliminates a need for a case and makes use easy. I have the earlier 1 gig unit and am happy with it, so I bought this for a relative as a gift.  It can hold several hundred songs....more than sufficient for my needs.

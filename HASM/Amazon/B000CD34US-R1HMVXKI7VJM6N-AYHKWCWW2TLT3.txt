Title: costly repairs
Content:
We've had this make and model and something breaks down on it about every other year.  The repairs each time has been a bit over $100.  I've had to do the repairs myself and have even had to purchase new a tool that I didn't own just to complete the new instillation of the new part.
I now wish I had not "gone cheap" but spent more money at a local store that has in house repair men and other customer support available beyond a remote phone call.

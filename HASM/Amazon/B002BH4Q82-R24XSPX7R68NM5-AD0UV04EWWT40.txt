Title: At this price this laptop is a steal
Content:
You won't find a laptop comparable to this one for less than $2000. 
Some details not given in the specs -
- supports up to 3 displays (laptop display, hdmi, vga)
- has a dock port
- video card uses DDR3 memory
- mousepad power can be turned on and off via a button
- full numeric keyboard!
- the HP recovery partition software asks you if you want to backup your program and user files to a USB hard drive before performing the recovery (SO helpful if you haven't made a recent backup!)
- the default sound settings are horrible and require some tinkering to get the speakers giving their maximum quality of sound. Volumes are down 50% and all the features are turned off by default.
- the 1600 x 900 resolution isn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. After the initial few seconds I didn't even notice the difference between it and my old laptop's display.
- Very sturdy design although easily scratchable.
- 5.3 Windows Experience base score (RAM). Other than the RAM everything else is a 5.6 - 5.9.
- BIOS gives the option to simulate multiple processors with the CPU's multiple cores (advanced users only).

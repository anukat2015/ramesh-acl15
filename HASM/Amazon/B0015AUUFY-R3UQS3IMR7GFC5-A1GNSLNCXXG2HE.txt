Title: Wonderful 'pocketable' dSLR
Content:
I have used nearly every OLYMPUS dSLR (exception being the E-300 & E-400).  I use the Olympus E-3 for my paid work and find it a superb camera.  But like many of you, I want a camera with SLR quality to carry around minus the weight of my workhorse E-3.  Enter the E-420, an absolute jewel of a camera whose IQ is top notch especially when compared to its market segment (Canon Rebels, Nikon D40/D60/D80, Pentax K200D, etc.).  The gradation is fantastic, rivaling even my E-3.  And coupling this, the world's smallest dSLR body with the new Pancake lens (25mm f/2.8, equivalant to 50mm in Full Frame) and you have a near 'pocketable' (depends on the size of the pocket) dSLR capable of taking phenomenal photos.  Now, is it a world beater?  No.  But it isn't meant to be.  It is meant for folks who want SMALL, but for whom Image Quality MATTERS.  And here, it scores a perfect 10 (or 5 STARS in this case).  As to the negative comment about focus points (you want 51 focus points, go spend 5K on the Nikon D3... truly a great camera, but marketed to a different segment of shutterbugs).  And I have no idea what the reviewer was talking about poor performance in low light (this is much more of a lens issue on any camera), all I can say is NONSENSE.  It does fine.  No better and certainly no worse than any of the other 20+ dSLRs I've shot with.  In fact, I used it as a 2nd camera during a 50th wedding anniversary party I was hired to shoot.  Used it Indoors.  It did great.  I got great photos and the client doesn't know what came out of the E-3 or the E-420.  The images are that good.  So if you want 'pocketable', but you do want to compromise on Image Quality, then go ahead and pick this baby up.  The likelihood of Buyer's Remorse is far smaller than this camera.  After that, You just do one thing more.  ...Enjoy.

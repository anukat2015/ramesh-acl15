Title: A Great, Quiet, Little Vac!
Content:
I really love this vacuum cleaner! I have never owned a canister before, I've always had an upright. I have been purchasing the Dirt Devil brand of vacuum cleaners for years and decided to give this nifty little canister a shot. I am not disappointed and you will not be either. It was a snap to assemble and when I turned it on, I was shocked at how quiet the motor is. I could actually hear the phone ringing while the motor was running! The controls are convieniently placed and the hose and stem of the vac is very lightweight. The canister rolled along with me while vacuuming, with very little effort on my part. It picked up a lot of dust and cat hair that my upright had left behind. It has a retractable power cord and adjustable suction speeds (low, med, high). The selling point for me was the "floor brush" tool. You do have to disconnect the base to use the floor brush, but that process is very simple. I highly recommend this canister vac and am very happy that I bought it!

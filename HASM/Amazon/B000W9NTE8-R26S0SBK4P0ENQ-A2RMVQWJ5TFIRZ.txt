Title: Oil Fired Heater
Content:
I bought this for my husband to heat his hangar which is a tall 50 x 50 metal building.  In the beginning he burned diesel fuel and it refused to light a second time.  
Then he called the Tech Rep and he suggested a higher pump pressure which resulted in satisfactory operation but fuel smells were objectionable.  He then switched to Jet A and was able to reduce pump pressure back to the recommended pressure for kerosene and everything works wonderfully.  The company was VERY HELPFUL AND INTERESTED IN OUR TOTAL SATISFACTION.  We were assured that when they finished advising us that we would be happy and we were.  Kerosene is $10 a gallon here.  He is now warm and cozy when working on his plane or other projects.  We live in Orlando, Florida and it doesn't get real cold but we were down into the teens recently.  We are now warm happy pilots!!

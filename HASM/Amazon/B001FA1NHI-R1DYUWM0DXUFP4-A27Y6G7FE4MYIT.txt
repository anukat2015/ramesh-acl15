I would like to say that i have the old generation ipod nano and this new purchase is for my wife. Much better!!  Screen is a larger display and i like the way it rotates once you move it to the side just like their iphone does.The larger screen really improved the product in my mind. Better color rendition and overall just a better product. My wife loves the color also. The headphones were an issue with me but they look like they have improved a bit on them but i do recommend other head phones if you truly want to keep them in your ears for better sound.

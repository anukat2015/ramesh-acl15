Title: works well when not broken
Content:
When this vacuum is working it is an excellent performer.  But ours has burned out twice in dramatic fashion.  The electronics in the handle that control the power head fry themselves by spitting sparks and smoke into the room.   The result is a completely scorched, melted and disintegrated electrical connector point when you detach the handle to further investigate.  The first time this happened I counted it as a fluke after 12 months of use.  Customer service politely sent us a new hose and we were back in business then exactly 12 months later it happened again.  One week after the warranty expiration.  This time customer service was not too keen to help even after the potential fire hazard.  Luckily we bought this from a large chain buying club store who were happy to take the unit back and refund me.  It appears the gauge of the electrical connections is not robust enough to handle the current going through the system.  Not properly engineered and a fire hazard as well.   Beware!

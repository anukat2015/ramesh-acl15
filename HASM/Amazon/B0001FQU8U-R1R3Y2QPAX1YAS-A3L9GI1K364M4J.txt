Title: looked great until...
Content:
Our unit was clearly manufactured on a Friday afternoon; Some screws were missing
on the access panels, others were half way in. It seemed to be a factory sealed unit.
Turned it on and it worked well for about 2 hours when the compressor suddenly siezed with a loud screech. Kenwood has a very poor distribution of repair centers, there are only about 4 in the whole state of New York, making service a real pain.

Had some initial reservations on this heater after reading previous reviews regarding noise and odor. My sister uses this model in her 2 year old's room and says it works noiselessly and after the initial burn off, there is no smell what-so-ever. I bought two to boost heat in our Victorian flat. After the initial burn off, there is no smell from either one. The one we use in the bedroom is completely noiseless. It heats VERY well and we are pleased with its performance. The timer is a great feature as we can have it start heating up before we get home, get out of bed, etc... Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the one we use in the kitchen. It heats up just fine however at each start up it makes noise - similar to that of when you heat oil for deep frying. As it is in the kitchen, we have yet to return it but may decide to do so. It seems that  when it works, it really works! But from my own experience it's a 50/50 chance.

Title: Decent coffee--all over the floor
Content:
Why can't someone make a coffee maker that makes decent coffee AND works.  This one makes decent coffee. Not great, but decent.  The more you make at one time, the better the coffee is.  At the minimum 4 cup setting (which is itself way too high a minimum) the coffee has a vague undertone of plastic. Make more and the coffee is actually good.
But the big deal is that, as reported by others (and ignored by yours truly), after a few weeks this coffeemaker begins to leak.  All over the counter, onto the floor, and if you're inclined to make a larger quantity of coffee to get better quality, what you get is more good coffee--on the floor. \
I called DeLonghi. They claimed never to have heard of this problem. I suggested they look at online reviews.  The sullen "customer service" representative offered to replace it for a $9 shipping fee!  Fortunately, Bed Bath and Beyond is willing to take it back.
Too bad. It was a clever idea to design a coffee machine that fills from the front.  They just forgot that that's where the coffee is supposed to come from when finished, not from the bottom!

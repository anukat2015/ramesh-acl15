Title: It's fair but there is a problem with the touch-mouse
Content:
After 3 months using it, I found that the touch mouse was acting like crazy. When I called the technicians at Sony, they told me it is a typical problem on 505.
I sent the notebook for touch-mouse replacement and took less than week to get it back. (I live in Great LA and the service center is in San Diego)
I have no complaint on Sony service center, but 2 months after the repair, there are some symptoms that I will probably have the same problem soon.

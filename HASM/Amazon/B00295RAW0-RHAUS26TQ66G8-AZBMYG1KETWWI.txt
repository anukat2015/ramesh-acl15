Title: Sony's egomaniacal reign of terror continues unabated
Content:
When I first spotted this product in the Sony store, the only question that went through my mind over and over again was "...why...".
*BY THE WAY FOR THOSE THAT MISSED IT THE FIRST TIME, AND FOR NEWCOMERS, HERE'S MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE PRODUCT*
First off, this is one amazingly well-engineered product.  It's solidly built, but still light and ultra portable.    Despite the small screen, web pages and applications are displayed brilliantly - it was a great idea to make the screen wider than it is tall, like most widescreen desktop monitors.  The battery life is impressive too, rated at about 6 hours with standard use.  The keyboard is much easier to use than it looks, and the trackball is just as easy to use as a mouse pad.  
*DID YOU GET THAT? DO YOU WANT ME TO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT A BUNCH OF INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY ON THE PRODUCT'S PAGE?*
Unfortunately, none of these features can withstand how incredibly asinine the price of this product is: A THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!!
When I was a child, I thought a thousand dollars was an impossibly large amount of money.  It was hard to imagine what I would do with that much money.  Now I know: I can spend it on a netbook that's actually inferior to every other netbook out there.
To be fair, Intel and Microsoft have teamed up to make our lives miserable by severely restricting the specs of netbooks - in case you haven't noticed already, almost all netbooks have extremely similar specs.  Manufacturers must obey their guidelines, otherwise they are punished by being denied the latest and greatest processors.  Hence, this netbook, which deviates from the norm, has a sub-standard processor when compared to the competition which cost hundreds less.  You really can't blame Sony for attempting to create a unique and successful product at the cost of performance which is really at the whim of the computer giants.

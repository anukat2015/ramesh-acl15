Title: An awesome heater even in severe weather
Content:
I purchased this heater about 2 years ago from Walmart.  I grew up with central heat but when I moved to a historical district in the Chicagoland area with older buildings with radiator heat that I couldn't adjust properly or consistently I sought out an alternative.  I was very nervous about having a heater in the house because I've never had one and we always hear about fires and such that have started because of them.  I felt completely safe using this unit.  I like the fact that the heat does not hit the floor or carpet but rather is directed out of the top of this model and that it has a thermostate which causes the unit to shut off once the room reaches the temp that you have programmed, then automaticly startes again if the temp drops beneath it.  This model effectively heated any room I placed it in...a large living room, med sized bedroom, even the bathroom.  Takes about 30 minutes to get the temp where you'd like it.  It may be placed directly against the wall and most folks don't realize that it's a heater!  
Recently I moved to a place with cental heat and gave my model to a friend who just about froze last winter, but since the gas prices have risen so dramatically I think I'll buy a set.

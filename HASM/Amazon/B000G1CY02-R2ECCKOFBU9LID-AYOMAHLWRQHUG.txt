Title: Quiet, warm, easy to use, solidly built
Content:
I put the heater in the laundry room (250 square feet) and turned it on high.  Although the temperature outside was in the 30s and there was no other source of heat in the room, it got warm enough that I had to open the door to let the heat go into the house.  Ran it for 12 hours and then switched it to low.  The room remained comfortably warm and the cats and dogs were all happy as clams.  The slight odor dissipated in a couple of hours.
This is my fourth Delonghi heater but the first mica one.  I am pleased.
Year later - I have now had this heater for a year and my father-in-law ran it every day, 12 hours a day, last winter.  It still works great and I'm ordering a second one.  Although I could get one that heats as well for less money, none are as silent or discrete as this one.

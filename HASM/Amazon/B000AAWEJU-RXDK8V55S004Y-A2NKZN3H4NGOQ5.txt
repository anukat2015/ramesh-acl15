Title: Wow...
Content:
I've been searching for the perfect canister vacuum for hardwood floors, while at the same time nursing my old decrepit stand-up along, knowing that it would be a bit of a financial plunge to get the one I would finally set my sights on.  This one was definitely not cheap, at $500.00, but so far, it's oh-so worth it!  It's extremely quiet (I can even talk on the phone while vacuuming) and has incredible sucking power. With two retrievers and a cat, we've put it through some interesting tests. Also, the handle extends to comfortably fit my 6'6" husband.
So far, the only drawback is the fact that, while it does usually follow you everywhere, with little coaxing needed, it has gotten itself into a couple of spots where the body has flipped on the hardwood.  The sides of the vacuum now look like they've gone a few rounds in the garbage disposal (and it has never been handled roughly at all -- I always immediately flip it back over when I see it's gone turtle on me).  So much for the beautiful, sleek, fire-engine red body!  If that's all that happens, though, I suppose it's a small price to pay for such a wonderful vacuum.

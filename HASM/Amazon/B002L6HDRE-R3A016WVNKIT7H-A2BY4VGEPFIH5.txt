Title: Great IPOD (for a person with small hands)
Content:
I bought the 8gb version for my daughter. She's crazy about it. She especially loves the FM radio.
I then bought one for myself... and returned it the next day. It's very difficult to operate with one hand. I have a deceased iPod classic 4th gen. Unlike my old iPod, I couldn't hold the nano in my palm and navigate with my thumb. The screen is very hard to read for the presbyopic generation.
Altogether, this is a great device, but didn't work out for me. I bought an iPod touch, which is fantastic!

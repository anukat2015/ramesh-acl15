Title: The poor performance and low quality keyboard
Content:
I got this computer as a 2nd computer to obtain extra long battery life.  However, its performance despond me.
ASUS claimed 12+ hr battery life.  I kept the computer under the condition where consumer can set to:  battery saving mode, dime the display, turn off the wireless, do not run any application.  The estimated battery from computer shown exact 10 hr, regarding the charging percentage in 100%, 95%, 90%, and 85%.  Basically, when the computer is idle, the estimated hour is always 10hr, less than 12 hr, also not accurate in different charging %.  So, I believe ASUS has lied to consumer about the battery life.
The keyboard can be better.  Very often, the mouse cursor jumps around while I am typing.  No any other computer keyboard will do this type poor job.
In addition, the computer does not come with Bluetooth and miss the carrying case and mouse as advertised by Amazon.
Recommend wait for better model.

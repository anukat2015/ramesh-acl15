Title: Q-Mark QPH4A Portable Electric Heater
Content:
after much searching I settled on the Q-Mark QPH4A Portable Electric Heater for my wife's potting shed and craft room, which is a separate building on our small property location.  Works great and it heats her potting shed in record time.  Her shed is 10' x 16' with a 10 foot ceiling, and is insulated and covered with T&G interior walls.  As such, she only has to run Q-Mark on the low setting.  Great product, and is relatively quiet and the thermostat works just fine.  Only thing I would have liked added to the Q-Mark would be a visable thermometer to see the actually temperature; but we just added a separate thermometer and that does the trick just as well.  Heavy duty and well built, I would recommend the Q-Mark without any doubt! Just buy it, and forget your heater worries!!!!!!!!!

Title: Very reliable thermostat for the price
Content:
It was hard to decide whether I should pay more to get the touch screen type or save money with this one.  After reading others' review, I decided to try this thermostat, since it has such a good price and ships free from Amazon.
My husband teased me how long the manual was; however, it wasn't that difficult to follow.  Now that the thermostat is all set to exactly how we like, I realized that we really don't even need to touch it again.  We are glad that we didn't spend the extra money for the touch-screen type.

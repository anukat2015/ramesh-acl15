Title: Sooooo Disappointed!
Content:
I too did my research before I purchased this, thought the heat option was worth the price.  Based on the reviews, I was very excited to start using my machine.  I have travertine floors downstairs, with no pets or kids.  When I started the vacuum the first day it seemed okay.  I thoroughly cleaned the filter and thought okay, not so bad.  But, then two days later, when I tried the vacuum again, it just did not want to pick up anything.  Ladies, let me tell you, I was literally chasing down anything light.....like hair, string, to the down feathers from the pillows.  I did however sort of expected that from the reviews.  
The reason for purchasing this product was for the cleaner, for those little spills in the kitchen.  I hate the idea of pushing dirty water around and then not being able to go into the room until the floors dried.  Once I got the hang of the motion, I noticed that it was leaving huge puddles of water that leaked at the end.  I would continually go over the puddles, even though the floors where clean and I was done, the puddles would keep coming back.  I didn't mind the bending down and whipping the floor dry with a paper towel, but then I thought, what's the use!  I would have to do this throughout the entire downstairs portion of the house which is over 2000sf!!  This may be okay for apartment usage.  I gave it two stars because the intention was there, but the product well ya know. Please do not waste your time, there has got to be a better way.

Title: The Zune Disappointment
Content:
I ordered my Zune on August 1st.  It was supposed to be instock and ship the next day.  It didn't.  I got the  Zune about two weeks later - I had already received the travel kit and the fm-car charger.  The Zune has aready died and has been sent back for repair or replacement - it was purchased for a special long airplane trip but probably won't return in time to make the trip.  The fm receiver charger doesn't work well in a large metro area - too many fm stations.  Now if the Amazon 90 days same as cash with your Amazon Visa doesn't work, the cycle will be complete.

Title: Great versatile "tablet" PC
Content:
I bought this PC on a whim after seeing an open box deal at Office Depot for $650.  I had to bite on that price.  I was really intending on returning it (I am a MacBook user).  I have to say, after getting it fully set up, I am loving it.  So much that I've listed my MacBook on eBay.  No, I am not saying this PC is better than the MacBook, but b/c I got it for so cheap and my MacBook will sell for ~$1200 on eBay, I figured I'd pocket the additional $600 and get another Mac when this baby dies.
So far I love it.  Yes, it does get hot, but nothing outrageous.  It's pretty cool to swivel the screen around and jot notes on it or read eBooks.  Bluetooth works great and lightscribe was a pleasant surprise.  In all, for just over $600 bucks, I got a steal.
Vista isn't that bad, BTW.  People on the internet are dramatic.
I would recommend this machine, even at Amazon's asking price.  The specs are incredible for a 12.1" tablet.

Title: high maintainence
Content:
If you like a great cup of coffee, and love spending lots of time cleaning and maintaining a coffee maker, then this product is for you. I would not recommend this machine to anyone, and I am taking my time here to discourage people from buying it. It has too many parts that need to be cleaned every time you make coffee (the internal grinder gets steamed up in the brewing process and gets caked with thick coffee muck).  In addition, a coffee tar build-up coats the entire inside of the machine and causes all the little mechanisms to stick.  For instance, the button release for the filter gets jammed and you have to reach up underneath to pull it out manually.  I also had the same experience as one of the other reviewers when during the grinding process, the filter door popped open and brewing coffee spilled everywhere. The grinder also gets stuck in the machine in the coffee sludge.  To keep the machine in working order,once a month, I find myself scrubbing it with a toothbrush under running water (not recommended by manufacturer).Also the carafe spout pours at a snail's pace, so you have too unscrew the lid anyway. Like I said earlier, it makes a great cup of coffee, but this grind and brew should have been engineered and designed better, especially with its high price tag.

Title: Stands up to name
Content:
I just purchased the vaccuum and love it! It definitely lives up to the "pet hair eraser" name! It has so many attachments that fit all surface areas so you can get to all of the hard to reach areas where pet hair and dust can collect. The only negative comment I have is that it is on the heavy side but I had a very small vaccuum before so it might just be me. Regardless, it is an excellent purchase and I would recommend it to others.

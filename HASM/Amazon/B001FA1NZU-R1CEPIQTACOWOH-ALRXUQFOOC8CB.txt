Title: Excellent All-around iPod
Content:
The iPod iTouch is an excellent all-around portable electronic device. I have photos, music, videos, and podcasts on my iTouch. The Wifi features works well and runs relatively quick. I use it to keep my contacts information, plan my day, and note taking. The many free applications are useful such as the flashlight and White Pages application.

Title: Good Laptop-Netbook hybrid
Content:
This is a very good buy for $300. Light weight with extended battery power and a centrino processor, this beats all atom based netbooks. Solid design and picture quality. I like the Keyboard design a lot better than Dell's. 
My adapter died within 2 months and Acer replaced it with a 65W adapter within a week. just taking away a star for that hassle. 5 Stars for the product, price and customer service.

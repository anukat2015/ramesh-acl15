Title: Great Camera
Content:
This is a great camera, loaded with features. Can use it as a fully automatic cameral with great results, or shoot it completely manual with full control over all settings. Intuititive menu and settings. Accurate color. It feels a little small in my big hands, but I paired it with an opteka battery grip and am happy with the heft and feel of it. Still learning about all the features. Brings excitement back to photography.

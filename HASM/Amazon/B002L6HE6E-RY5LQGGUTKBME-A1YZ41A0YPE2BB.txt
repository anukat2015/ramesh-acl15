Title: 5th Generation has advantages
Content:
As someone who had a previous generation nano ipod, I like the upgrade.  Love the radio feature - either for something different or to tune into one of the TVs at the gym.   Also like the screen better than the prior generation.   Settings like shuffle and repeat are also easier to use.  I debated on the ipod touch but just found it wasn't in the budget yet.  Plus the radio is a nice addition.  Overall, recommend.  
As far as Amazon - fast and reliable shipping.  No issues.

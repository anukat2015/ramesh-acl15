Title: I'm so glad I bought it!
Content:
I had vacillated for a long time about buying a iPod, but finally decided to get one for traveling, and I'm really glad I did.  I just wish it would connect to wifi networks easier, and the charge would hold longer. I Love having books at my fingertips, and being able to read in a restaurant as I eat when I'm alone.

Title: Perfect Machine
Content:
We had many vac's and after comparing vac's online for reviews and cost I purchased this Hoover S3765-040.  It is the easiest, compact and powerful vac I had.  I saw some reviews about having to empty the dust canister too often but I don't see why even though I ususally empty it at the end of every vacuuming.  The smaller attachments are conviently inside the top cover.  I can't say a bad thing about this vacuum cleaner.  I really like that there are three power settings for smaller rugs.  The main roller head is a perfect width and makes carpets look good!

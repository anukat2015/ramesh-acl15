Title: Best I've Ever Owned
Content:
I've owned this coffee maker for just over a year now and find it the best ever.
I originally was hesitant based on my experience with other thermal coffee makers and their small size, usually only about ten cups.  This maker may call itself a ten-cup but it's a 12 by any other measurement.
Yes, it's tall but it keeps the coffee hot for hours in the unbreakable stainless steel carafe.  It only takes about ten minutes to brew a pot and the timer ensures my first cup of the morning is ready.
If you're tired of taste of warmed-over coffee that's been setting on the warmer for hours, this is your new coffee maker.

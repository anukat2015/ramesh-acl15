Title: Well worth every penny.
Content:
Bought the black body--which feels sturdy, solid, expensive and comfortable in my hands--with an EF 24-85 1:3.5-4.5 zoom lens.  I love this, my first SLR, camera.  It's fast, takes big bright sharp pictures and has more features than I can imagine using right now.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade to an SLR from a point and shoot.  Obviously, a pro would be limited by this camera, but not, yet, a regular user like me.  My only beef so far is a minor quibble: custom white balance is a 5 or 6 step process I haven't mastered yet.

Title: Great Heater for Diabetics
Content:
I bought this oil-filled heater to place under my desk, to keep my lower body warm this winter. As a diabetic with no real feeling in my feet anymore, this heater is ideal, because the fins are encased in a plastic polymer that doesn't allow my toes to come in direct contact, so I don't worry about accidental burns. The ground-interrupt plug is another plus, although the cord would benefit from a stout flex-lead at the plug.
   The timer feature is great--it allows programming for the requisite warm-up time common to oil-filled heaters. This heater will keep a 20' by 20' room warm. I recommend it, unless your need is instantaneous heating. Also ideal and safe for a warm bathroom in the winter mornings.

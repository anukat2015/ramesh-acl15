Title: Apple has done it again -- perhaps even better than ever
Content:
As much as I love the freedom that my 4g iPod provides (well, minus the hard drive constantly being full), there's something special about knowing every track that comes on will be one of your favorites.
With space at a premium, you've got to be choosy with the tracks on your Shuffle, but it just makes it all that much more satisfying.  I bought one for myself and fell in love, so I bought the orange variation for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day and she loves her perhaps even more than I love mine.  
The orange is a stunning color -- I only wish that it and the others had been available when I picked mine up although the default silver is no slouch to look at.

Title: makes good coffee
Content:
This coffee maker makes good coffee.  It's well made and stylish in a retrograde sort of way.  It takes 24 ounces of water to fill it to the "six cup" mark inside, so I'd call it a 3 cup maker, or maybe a 4 cup maker, but not 6 cups.  That's ok though, since I'm usually making coffee for myself.  But even using percolator style paper filters, sediment still ends up in the coffee.  And its a bit harder to clean than a drip style maker.  I can handle harder to clean, but not the sediment.  So I bought another drip maker.

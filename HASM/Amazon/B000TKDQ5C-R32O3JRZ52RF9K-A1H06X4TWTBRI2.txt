Title: Warms my feet and small office very nicely
Content:
This is a small heater that I got to warm my home office ~  it sits under my desk near my feet.   It has several heat settings and puts out good heat, quickly.   My office has a large window and it has been a cold winter this year.   I keep my central heat thermostat on 62, so it is chilly in the house.   This heater warms my feet, and eventually the room (if I shut the door to the room).   In fact, I have to move the heater farther away from my feet after a while (if I want to leave the settings on High to warm the room) because it's too hot on my ankles.

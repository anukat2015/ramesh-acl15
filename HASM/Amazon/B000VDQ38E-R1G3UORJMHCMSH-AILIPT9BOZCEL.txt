Title: Don't pass this up
Content:
I bought this machine as a back-up to our $1400.00 Orick that is constantly breaking.  This vac is heavy and not so great on smooth surfaces such as hard wood.  You will not,however, find a better vac for carpets!  I am always amazed at how good a job this thing does on our carpets and area rugs.  We have a gaggle of kids and a pooch who sheds all over the place and this thing is more than up to the challenge.

I won't make this a technical review as there are already many of those...
My photography experience stems from being a Photojournalist in the Navy for 6 years shooting film, and then more recently being a photo assistant for some commercial shooters just for extra cash. (most of them using cannon equipment)
I like the Nikon D300, and their products in general, because of their easy functionality, the menus are easy to navigate and settings can be quickly switched on-the-fly. Image quality is superb. You can go full-manual, or select aperture or shutter priority, or switch to program mode and let the camera do all the hard work with it's pre-programmed "scene recognition" system. Some of the lower-end Nikons have extra modes such as Sport, Portrait, Landscape, etc... right on the dial, the D300 does not, but it does allow you create those types of modes with your own custom setting for each and then save then on your custom shooting menu... no problem.
I got the 200mm zoom lens kit, which is a decent piece of glass, but would recommend the 50mm fixed lens for stills, portraits and landscapes.
In general, this camera does everything the big-buck cameras do, uses the DX format lenses that are far less expensive than the full frame FX ones, and has wonderful image quality and reliability as well as ease-of-use out of the box. The only limitation is the user... You!

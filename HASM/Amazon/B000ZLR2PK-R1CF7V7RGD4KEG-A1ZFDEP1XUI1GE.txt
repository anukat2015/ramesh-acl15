Title: Didn't last 5 minutes
Content:
This vacuum threw the belt on the power head in the first 5 minutes of use. It isn't worth trying to make it work and I am returning it.
Had a Hoover that did the same thing as well as many other reviewers.
It is getting harder to find a quality vacuum anymore....

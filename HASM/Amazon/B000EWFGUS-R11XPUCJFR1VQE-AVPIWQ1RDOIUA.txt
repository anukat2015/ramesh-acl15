Title: Best Ever
Content:
We've been brewing coffee every morning over the past month with this Hamilton Beach 43253. Our experiments with it have paid off. Brewing from two cups at one time, all the way up to twelve cups, while varying the amount of ground coffee, this coffee maker made the best coffee every time for us. It's the best coffeemaker we've ever owned over the past thirty (30) years. And...it's modern attractive, aerodynamic and easy to clean. Thank you Hamilton Beach.

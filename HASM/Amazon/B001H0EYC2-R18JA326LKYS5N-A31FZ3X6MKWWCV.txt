Title: warms you up but not quite worth buying
Content:
This fan works great to heat up a room but it does have its draw backs. The multiple temp settings and high/low fan setting are a plus. One of the things that I was looking for in a heater was oscillation and this one has it, but the problem is that it doesn't shutoff when the fan shuts off. It just keeps on oscillating! You have to manually switch it on/off. It is also a little on the noisy side and makes a slight popping sound as it turns from side to side. Safety feature-wise, it does shut off immediately if tipped over but does not shut off if covered. There is a warning on the box that items can burst into flames if placed on or too close to the heater.

Title: Very Good Vacuum
Content:
I've had this vacuum for over a year and have had no problems with it. Compact, well built, quiet, and light weight.  I have owned several top of the line Hoover vacuums and this vacuum is lighter weight, just as powerful and much quieter. The power switch on the canister and the seperate power switch on the power wand is not an issue for me since the power switch on the canister can be easily turned on with the foot. Highly recommended.

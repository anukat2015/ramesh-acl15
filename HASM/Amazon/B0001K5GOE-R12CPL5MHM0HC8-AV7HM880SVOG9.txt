Title: Avoid this machine, its attraction is pure marketing
Content:
We have owned this vacuum for about a year and a half and are completely frustrated by it. 
First of all, it DOES have a filter, and it is small and clogs quickly. Once the filter clogs you have to remove it, wash it, AND LET IT DRY before using it again. 
The power head is air powered and very fussy, it won't work with the filter clogged, or if the small air diverter to the powerhead turbo fan gets even partially clogged, which it does all the time. 
Animal hair clogs the bearings of the powerhead brush frequently. This then requires you disassemble the powerhead and pick away at the hair on the shaft of the brush assembly.
It is not good for picking up larger particles such as small wood chips, small stones, since they tend to damage the bagless portion of the vacuum.
It is almost entirely plastic, so even though the design is ultra-modern and interesting, the durability is less than desireable.
It has a short power cord.
It is nice to be able to pack it up an put it away in a small closet, but takes a few minutes to do, so it rarely gets done, we just put it away like any other vacuum.
When emptying the baggless chamber, you really have to go outside because a lot of dust billows up when being dumped. You almost need to devote a plastic trash bag to carefully dump it into, each time you empty it to avoid making a huge mess, and being exposed to all that dust and debris. And this really defeats the environmental benefits of it.
This machine is really a marketing genius, but really not a mechanical genius.

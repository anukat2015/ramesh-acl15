Title: Great Camera
Content:
This is a great camera and well worth the wait as a trade up from my 10D. I purchased with the 28-135 IS lens, as this was a terrific value, and what's one more lens to play with. My previous experience with the 10D, made it easy to navigate the many features. Picture quality is outstanding. There have been many comments about excessive noise at the higher ISO levels. It is less than my 10D, and easily minimized in Photoshop.

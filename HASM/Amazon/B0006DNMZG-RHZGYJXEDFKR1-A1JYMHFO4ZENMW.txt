Title: Don't Buy This Product
Content:
We have bought three of these heaters -- not from Amazon but at Wal-Mart.  My advice:  Despite the low price, don't buy it.  The first died within two weeks, and we exchanged it.  The second one's thermostatic control malfunctioned by the end of the winter, and the heater kept turning on and off regardless of the temperature in the room.  Foolishly, we tried a newer model of the same heater the next winter.  It lasted three months, first losing one of its fan speeds and then dying altogether.  We're now moving toward summer and don't need a room heater, but when I buy a new one next summer, it won't be this type and probably won't be a Honeywell product.

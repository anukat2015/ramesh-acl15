Title: Best mp3 player ever made
Content:
If your looking for a new mp3 player this iPod is the way to go. Has everything you could want in a mp3 player. This is basically the iPhone minus the talking part of course. I love how I can sit at work and surf the web or listen to music and sneak in a movie. I could not live without this. If you plan to download movies to it I suggest the 32 or 64 gb. the 8g fills up fast.

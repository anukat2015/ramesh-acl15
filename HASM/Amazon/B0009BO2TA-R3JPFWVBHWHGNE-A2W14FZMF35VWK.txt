Title: Great little vacuum
Content:
We just bought this little vacuum, on sale for $49.95, worth every penny. We have a small house with wood floors. It is great for our floors and furniture. I wouldn't want to try to use it on heavy carpet, it's not really made for that but for us it couldn't be better. The wand and hoses stay on just fine, hopefully it will continue to be a 5 star machine.

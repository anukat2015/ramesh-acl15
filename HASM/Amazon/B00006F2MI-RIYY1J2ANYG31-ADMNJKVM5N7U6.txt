Title: disappointed
Content:
We've had this type less than 3 years and today I just sent a note to the manufacturer to find out why its no longer brewing the full reservoir and instead does only a few cups, leaving water in the reservoir. Filter in or filter out makes no difference. A second or third brew cycle will process the remaining water.  However, considering the cost and the brandname this shouldn't be happening.  Will consider another brand since this is our second cuisinart having had different difficulties with the first.

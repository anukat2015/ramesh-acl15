Title: Super product
Content:
I have had my current Brew 'n Go for 5 years.  I don't know what others are complaining about because it makes a perfectly HOT, adequately strong cup of coffee EVERY TIME.  On rare occasions when my wife made my coffee and put too much coffee in the filter, it overflowed slightly into the cup but it wasn't the fault of the product.  I use a ladle, such as the ones supplied in many coffee cans.  Put 2 ladles in and keep your basket and holder clean.  Run a cup full of vinegar through once a month to clean it and you'll never have a problem.  I suppose like any product, there may be the odd lemon out there waiting to be taken off some retailer's shelf but this is the second one of these coffeemakers I've had in the past 10 yrs and I've had no problems.

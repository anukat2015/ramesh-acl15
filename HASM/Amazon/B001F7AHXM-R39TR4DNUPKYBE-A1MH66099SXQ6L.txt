Title: Great for study
Content:
I never listen to pop music more than a few minutes a month so I had no need for an IPod until I saw that I could listen to my spiritual studies using one, instead of having to listen to cds which are much bulkier.  I found somebody in my Church who puts varies cd and dvd talks and videos on IPods for others in our Church.  It makes study so much more convenient and I can play it through external speakers and through my auto with an FM adaptor.

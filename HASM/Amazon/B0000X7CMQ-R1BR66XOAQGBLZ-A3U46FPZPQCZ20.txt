Title: No problems, makes GREAT coffee
Content:
Several months ago, I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this coffeemaker.  I'm thrilled with it.  A couple of issues being discussed when I bought the coffeemaker included temperature of water and filter size.  
First, a caveat:  I am not a fan of scaldingly hot coffee.  Reviewers mentioned that using ice cold water made coffee that was not hot enough but using cold tap water left a muddied flavor.  I, too, found that ice cold water seemed to overwhelm the machine's heater mechanism, but haven't had any problems with muddy flavored coffee using tap water.  So tap water has suited me fine.
I also found that #4 size filters fit provided you fold the edges of the filter along the seam and then make sure the bottom of the filter is puched down into the bottom of the basket.
I haven't had any problems with leakage from the lid onto the counter.
I'm very happy with this coffee maker and have no regrets about buying it.

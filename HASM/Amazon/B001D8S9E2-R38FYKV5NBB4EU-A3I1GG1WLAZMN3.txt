Title: My Apple Upgrade
Content:
I have upgraded from an Apple 2E and wish I lived closer to any Apple Store.  I need instructions.  The tutorials are good but nothing like a "hands on" session with one who knows.  After I learn the ropes, it will be a welcome addition.  Get Pentagon Federal Credit Union to upgrade their banking/credit cards for Quicken for the MAC.  I have Snow Lepard and hope it is an improvement on to older system.  I am too new to know.  Jack

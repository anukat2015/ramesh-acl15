Title: Great For Small Unheated Room
Content:
I use this heater in an unheated screen porch where my dogs sleep. Storm windows keep the wind out, but It was still too cold for the dogs. This heater is great if you're concerned about "dog proofing". It was mounted to the wall and I covered the cord with wooden trim along the baseboard, preventing cord chewing. It heats the 12' by 15' room to a nice 70 degrees, even though the walls are not insulated. Oklahoma has fairly mild winters, rarely getting below 20 degrees, or so. I can't say how the heater would work in this application if you have harsh winters, but for keeping an unheated, small room warm in a mild climate, its great.

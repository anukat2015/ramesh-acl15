Title: :(  Battery life = 1.5 hours
Content:
I was disappointed to find out the fully charged battery only lasts 1.5 hours.  I can't imagine what kind of a charge it will hold in 6 months. I notice now that there is no mention of battery life on any of the Asus laptops I looked at. Perhaps there is a battery upgrade?

Title: Great camera!! Upgraded from D40...
Content:
When I first decided to purchase a DSLR I did a little research and ended up buying a D40 because of it's low cost and "easy of use". I quickly realized I had made a mistake and upgraded to the D80. The D40 was really more difficult to use, requiring me to access the menu every time I wanted to change a simple setting. The D40 took great photos, but it was too frustrating to use.
So, I bought the D80 from Cameta Camera(highly recommend them) and it is just in a different catagory than the D40/40x/60. I'm very happy with it so far and it is well worth the difference in $$$. 
Initially I tried out the Canon XTi as well. The D80 seemed far superior to me and it much, MUCH nicer to hold. The XTi's grip is absolutely TERRIBLE. I recently tried out the new XSi as well, and even though it seems like an improvement over the XTi, I still prefer the D80.

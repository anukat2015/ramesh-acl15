Title: Great product
Content:
I bought this heater after loosing money on CozyLegs.  This heater is the best little heater, I find the remote control works real well to help from having to get up from our desks to make setting changes.  We have a fairly big room we use it in.  The only complaint that I have with it, is that when my wife is down here, she can change the tempature of the room from 67 to 75 in only less than 30 mins, and I am complaining that I need the thing turned off.

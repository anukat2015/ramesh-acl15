Title: It is supposed to be odorless as labelled on the box
Content:
When I first used the heater, there was an odor in the air that give me an headache.  I don't know what chemical they used to induce such an odor, but it nauseated me.  I experienced this using DeLonghi SafeHeat heater.  Both were made in China.

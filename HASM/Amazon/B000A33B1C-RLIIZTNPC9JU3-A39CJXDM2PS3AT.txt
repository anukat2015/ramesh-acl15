Title: Lil' Dragon is toasty!
Content:
We have used oil-filled heaters for several years. My daughter is a bit reluctant to have one in her room at night because they make ticking sounds. (ticking closet monsters, anyone?) 
Anywho, one of our heaters actually got hot enough to melt the control plate! It was a Soleus brand and we are not looking to get another one of those - maybe it wouldn't ignite, but why take that chance?
So, my boss brings a Dragon to my circa 1970s office building. You know, the kind that have zero insulation. Within minutes, the Dragon is literally puffing hot air and toasting the entire room. The outer case did get hot enough that I moved the heater away from our showroom. Don't want any kids to get scorched!
Now I have one for the house. Neither Dragon smells bad, but this newest one has made a couple of loud knocks. Not nearly as quiet as the first one, but still a wonderfully toasty heater for close proximity.
A lady at the checkout stand raved about how she can use this at home and not hurt her cats. It gets hot enough to scorch Kitty's nose, but I guess they would learn pretty quickly that this is not something to nap upon. 
all in all, a really nice heater.

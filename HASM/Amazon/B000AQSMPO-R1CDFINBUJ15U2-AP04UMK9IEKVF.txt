Content:
Worked great for 24 days.  I actually enjoyed the convenience and coffee so much that I bought 3 more 22 cup boxes of assorted coffee flavors.  On day 25, I turned on the unit and it began trying to pump water but to no avail.  I turned it off.  Turned it on.  Unplugged it.  Plugged it in, etc... with no success.  Pump comes on (at least the sound of a pump) but no water goes into the unit.  After a few minutes, it turns off.  After some searching of reviews and other forums, I see that this is not an uncommon occurence.  I would normally pour over reviews and would have shied away from this product based on what I've seen.  But, this was a Christmas present so now I will see how Keurig customer service handles it.  Will update based on the experience. 
Update:  First, I thought I would try using the online contact email since I don't have lots of time to wait on the phone.  I sent email on 1/20/2009.  I immediately received an automated response that said I would have a reply in 1 or 2 business days...... I received a reply on 1/29/2009 (7 business days) which asked me to please call the customer service number and have my serial number handy.  So, guess I will now call from home and go through the "try this" hoops...  I will update.
By the way, the machine is still having the problem that I described.  But, as in other posts, it now works sometimes and sometimes not.  So, I cross my fingers when I turn it on and see if I get Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde coffee maker.

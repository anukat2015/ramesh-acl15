Title: Can you be in love with a vacuum?
Content:
I am in love with this vacuum.  It is everything it is supposed to be.  Yes, you do have to change the bags often. Yes, it does not have attachments.  But those all take away from suction power and boy does this thing suck!!!!  It totally cleans my acid stained concrete floors and all my rugs.  I love the little buttons to switch back and forth between floors.  It is super easy.  I also love the retractable cord.  This is probably my favorite part.  I always used to hate wrap the cord up and found it tangled all the time with my old vacuum.  I love putting a couple of drops of my favorite essential oil on a square of paper towel and putting it next to the bag inside the vacuum.  My whole house smells so good and fresh when I vacuum.  I love it, love it, love it!

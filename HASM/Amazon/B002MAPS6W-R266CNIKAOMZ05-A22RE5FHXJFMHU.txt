Title: Really long battery life
Content:
very nice mp3 player.  i work 11 hour shifts and by the end of the shift, i usually have nearly half battery left.  i listen to it almost the entire shift, so i probably get 9 hours of playtime with about half battery life.  i also really like the fact that it supports other files besides just mp3, like ogg.  it's also very simple to put music on, just plug it in to pc and it shows up as flash drive.  i use linux, and it's great, just drag and drop files.  and since you can pick folders to play, i can easily create my own playlists by just creating whatever folders i want.  when my coworkers, who all have ipods, have to stop and re-charge their ipods during the shift, i keep listening. and i understand ipods won't play when charging, but this sansa does.

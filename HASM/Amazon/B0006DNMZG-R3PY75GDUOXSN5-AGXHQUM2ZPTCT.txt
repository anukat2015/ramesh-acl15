Title: The Perfect Small Space Heater
Content:
This heater thoroughly warms my small studio (about 600 square ft.). Of the three setting modes on the left knob, fan only, low and, high, I usually need only the low setting and I set the right thermostat knob in the middle of the low-to-high span. Sometimes, early in the morning, if it's particularly cold, I'll set the knobs to high-high to warm things up rapidly; however, I have to remember to lower settings rather quickly, or it will become too hot and I'll need to turn on the 'fan only' to cool down the space a bit... 
I like the heater's round design and its lever on top that opens or partially closes the louver inside for uni-directional, or surround-heat flow. The only thing the heater lacks is a handle: it can become too hot to pick up comfortably and has to be lifted with two hands by its bottom -- which is difficult. Cumbersome. For that reason, I keep mine on a low table on casters. I just roll with it...!

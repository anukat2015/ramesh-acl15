Title: DIsappointing performance
Content:
I have had my Dirt Devil Vision vacuum only one month and already need to change the filter.  At $20 per filter, this could be a very expensive vacuum to maintain.  I don't have an exceptionally dirty house, and have mostly hardwood floors, so having to replace the filter was a shock.  When the filter clogs, the vacuum overheats and shuts down....right in the middle of whatever you are doing.  I would never buy another Dirt Devil product after this poor performance.

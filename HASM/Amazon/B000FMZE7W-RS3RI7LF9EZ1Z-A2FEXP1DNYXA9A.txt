Title: Better than what you might think
Content:
Ok so I have read mixed reviews of the Zune.  
After having it for a couple of months, I must say, I'm quite satisfied.
I'm definitely not an iPod type of person so I definitely wanted to check out the Zune while Amazon was having a black Friday special of $89.99.  I couldn't just let this deal pass me.
I love all the features Zune has.  A lot of people complain about Zune's software and I don't have any complaints.  (I complain a lot too.)
I think the battery life is awesome.  The radio is definitely a plus.  I haven't seen one of those on an iPod.
Overall, I think that the Zune is definitely worth the money that it's selling for.

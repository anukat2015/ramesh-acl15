Title: Fine and Fine but one catch
Content:
I bought the Sanyo S700P after quite a research around and I guess I did not do it wrong.
It works overall fine, the motor sound is not that big and etc.
The only problem which is rather considerable, I am afraid, is the connection between the dust bag and the end of hose is not air tight and consequently there is some pretty much of dust  around the dust bag openings after vacuum is done. Some dust built up around openings is naturally spread around inside the cabin(body of vacuum).

Title: A great investment and worth the price
Content:
First, let me just say that prior to buying the Miele Antares, I owned a different ("low-end") Miele vacuum for 16 years. I ran it all the time, it was totally ahead of its time in terms of performance and style, and I never once serviced it. 
However, after 16 years, it needed minor servicing, and though they told me at the shop that it still had some life left in it (the vacuum store told me that Miele motors are built to last for 20 years), I decided to trade in my old Miele and upgrade to the Antares. WOW! This unit is amazing. It's quiet, it's lighter, it has variable settings for suction power, and it's really powerful. I highly recommend investing in the add-on turbo brush ($100), especially if you have pets. (I hate to vacuum, but I do have pets, and the turbo brush literally scrubs the fur out of your carpet.) 
But even if you own an old Miele, like my previous one, you could just buy the turbo brush and add it on--the Miele design is consistent enough that often the same components can be used for multiple models, covering a wide span of years (for example, the Antares uses exactly the same vacuum cleaner bags that my 16-year-old Miele used). 
I recommend that you don't waste your time with vacuum cleaners that will only last 3-5 years. Read the user reviews online of other competing products that don't last nearly as long, and then buy a Miele.

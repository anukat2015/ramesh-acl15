I was very pleased with amazon's ordering, service and delivery. The laptop seems to be everything I expected. I really like the fact that you can use 2 finger scrolling on the touchpad, makes it easy to get around. Buy one before December and you get FREE Leopard System 10.5 from the Apple website, just pay handling and tax (10.87). I'm still debating whether to get applecare. For the price of the computer I'm thinking I will. Had bad luck with my iMac 17" that was just 1.5 years old. Screen lines and motherboard. Hope this review helps.

Title: Fantastic Camera
Content:
Adds a little bit of weight and size on the 400D (Rebel XTi) but it also adds a lot of wonderful features and some increased quality.  Most notably for me was the noise level seems much lower on the 40D.  Personally I like the size increase, I have large hands and the XTi always was so small in my hands.  The kit lens is also quite nice, no, its not an L lens but its much much better than the 18-55mm that comes with the Rebel series.
Added features are great, custom shooting modes, dual wheel control, custom menus, spot metering, just to list a few.  Absolutely great camera.

Title: Love it...
Content:
I still have my D70 which I still love.  The D90 has everything I like about the D70 plus more.  The larger LCD is a big improvement.  The increase in pixils is helpful when trying to extract a "picture within a picture".  Had some issues with that with the 6 mp D70.  Most of the buttons are familiar so that helps previous Nikon owners.  My favorite new feature is the incredible upgrade in low-light situations.  
Overall, I'm extremely happy with the D90.

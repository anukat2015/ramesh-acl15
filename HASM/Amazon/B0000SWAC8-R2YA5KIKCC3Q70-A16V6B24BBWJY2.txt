Title: Vacuum is falling apart and doesn't pick up dirt
Content:
We bought this vacuum just 5 months ago and it's already falling apart.  Where the motorized brush head connects to the rest of the vacuum broke. To fix it the whole brush head needs to be replaced.  Just a couple of weeks after purchasing the vacuum, the attachment holder caught on a corner and part of it snapped off.   Aside from the vacuum breaking, the motorized brush head doesn't suck all the dirt from our carpet.  I think the brush spins so quickly that it kicks the dirt/debris right out.  If I stand behind the motorized brush head, the debris hits my ankles as it flings out of the head.  Keep in mind, our carpets are not very dirty b/c we don't wear our shoes in the house and we vacuum at least a couple of times a week.  FYI - we had our last vacuum, a Kenmore, for 8 years without many problems.  We're going to try returning this vacuum and then heading to Sears to purchase a Kenmore.

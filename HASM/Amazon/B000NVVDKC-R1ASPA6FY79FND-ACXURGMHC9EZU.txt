Title: A Quantum leap from your point and shoot
Content:
Here's the scenario...you go on vacation with your high end ($400) point and shoot digital camera...you take a ton of pictures. The ones you've taken out to about 20 feet look OK, but anything beyond that look crappy. You look around on the tour bus and see other people with DSLR's and wonder. You talk to a few of them and see their pics and think "wow!" I wanna take pictures like that. And then you come home and look at all the camera tests & reviews and find the Olympus E510. At the top of the game and considerably cheaper than the Nikons, Canons, etc. this camera takes fantastic looking pictures...and isn't that what it's all about? Sure, it's a little more complicated than the point and shoot but if you read the manual and get the instruction video it's really just as easy and WAY more versatile. No it won't fit in your pocket so keep your point and shoot. But if you want to take REALLY GOOD pictures, get this camera. With the two lenses in the kit, you'll be able to cover most situations. Your telephoto pics will be crisp, the images will snap out at you. You'll discover that you actually love photography as a creative activity and with this camera you'll WOW yourself and friends with the results. Get this camera!

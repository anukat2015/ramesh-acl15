Title: great for what it is
Content:
I bought this for my husband to use at work (he stocks at a liqour store.) He's not very fond of Apple. This was great for him. He really likes the display because its clearly defined, bright, and easy to see. The battery life is also awesome. He usually goes about three days of using it at work before having to recharge it. He says the disc that comes with it to load the program for loading music doesn't work in most cd drives anymore. It's a tiny disc. So he just has to move files- which he doesn't mind. I shopped around quite a bit. I saw a lot of great reviews for this, and for the money and amount of gigabytes this really seemed the best. It's pretty small in size but not too small. He had a pebble before this and it got washed because I didn't feel it when I was searching pockets. I feel like the sansa is a little more noticeable. He keeps it in his pocket so the complaint of sweat or condensation ruining it won't really affect him.

Title: Impressive multi-purpose air treatment
Content:
Whynter Air Cooler/Heater/Humidifier
Timeframe: 2 months
My usage conditions: 51F to 78F, Humidity 60% to 80%
Functions used: Heater, evaporative air cooler, humidifier.
Design:
I selected this primarily for the design and color scheme. I did not want another white/beige appliance or some psychedelic blue or pink candy painted device. Conventionally shaped and subtle in overall appearance. Top marks.
Functionality: The Whynter air cooler is a misnomer, while it does a solid job cooling a 150square foot space, it does a whole lot more than cool. The heat was nice to have when the temperature dipped and the humidity control is very useful when dealing with dry air resulting from heater use. Intuitive and easy to control. The  water tank at the base take a bit of jiggering to slide in and out but otherwise I do not have any issues with it. The filters built into the unit do provide some degree of purification. My room air purifier lasted about 30% longer before the indicator light came on.  It is light weight and portable, but be careful when you move it with the water tank filled.
Quality:
Well built with softtouch controls. The remote control was responsive and fit nicely into the attached holster on the unit. Material is were primarily plastic. Easy to clean and maintain. Pre-filter is easily removed and cleaned. No fuss device.
Price:
Quite reasonable for all that it does. I would take this over 3 or 4 separate devices any day.
Overall:
One of my better purchases this year. top scores across the board.

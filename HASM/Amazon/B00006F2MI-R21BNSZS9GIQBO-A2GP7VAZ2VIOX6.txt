Title: Pinnacle of home brewing / Cleaning grinder is inconvenient
Content:
I received the Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew as a Christmas gift.  I was initially intimidated by the myriad of parts.  However, after stumbling through the user manual, I assembled the beast (15''high 8'' x 7-1/2''), installed the charcoal filter, blendered the beans and had coffee brewing.
My efforts were soon rewarded with the best cup of coffee my home had ever produced.  And thanks to the thermal carafe, the results remained hot for several hours.
Other nice features are the elegant brushed stainless exterior of the main unit and carafe. Also, the programmable timer is useful and easy to navigate.
After a month of daily use, the only continuing nuisance is the mandatory cleaning of the grinder after each use.  During the brewing process, escaping steam cakes any remaining bean dust residue inside the grinder.  Having to rinse and dry the grinder seems a small penalty for the convenience of an all-in-one unit that produces such fine nectar, but it does become a chore.
Overall the Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew is a well-constructed, attractive and functional appliance that I would recommend for those willing to spend $100+ for an all-in-one bean grinder and coffee brewer.

Title: Buyer Beware!
Content:
This vacuum lasted about two months before it clogged on us.  I have one dog so there isnt all that much hair and after cleaning every possible filter, it still was showing the filter being clogged up. I suggest you read reviews of people that have had this vacuum for at least a few months, you'll be glad you did. DONT BUY!

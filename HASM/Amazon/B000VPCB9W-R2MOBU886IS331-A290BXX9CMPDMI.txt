Title: Compact and inexpensive Holmes heating unit
Content:
The heaters are relatively inexpensive and very compact.  Overall, I think they are worth the money.  The only complaint with the unit is that, unlike a lot of others I've had, it doesn't automatically shut off upon tipping.  The manual says it will shut off if tipped, but it isn't immediate.  Would prefer to see that safety feature improved, however I may be missing something.  The unit remains cool on the outside and presents less hazard in a lot of ways to others, so a plus there.

Title: Sony P Series
Content:
This latop is the most beautiful thing ever. It's really slow though, I dont know if it's windows vista that makes it that slow or the processor itself but I waste so much time browing the net with it. It also very small, the text is so small that you have to take it really close to your eyes in order to read. I had to sold it on ebay just after a week of using it. I can live with the small text but the speed really killing me.

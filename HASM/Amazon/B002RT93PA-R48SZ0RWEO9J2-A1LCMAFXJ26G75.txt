Title: I don't know who these other users are, but this is not a good computer
Content:
Maybe I received a previously loved model, but this computer sucks for several reasons.  I had it for two weeks and this is what I observed. 
While fast, I never really had a chance to put it through hoops with any gaming or true test of the processor.  ALso, it bricked itself about once a day from hardware (no blue-screen or Windows 7 equivalent), just the screen turned black and emitted a buzzing noise until I held down the power button for a few seconds.
1) Screen resolution: 1366x768 is considered acceptable now?  My last computer was 5 years old and not even top of the line at that time, but I was shocked to see these Jitterbug-like icons and general ugliness on a 2010 device.  I don't know how these marketing jerks can think they can get away with calling this HD when it is nowhere close.
2) Touchpad is terrible.  The scrolling bar on the right seems like it was intentionally designed to be frustrating.  In addition, the multitouch frequently reacts if I have my other palm anywhere resting on the keyboard (like if you use keyboard shortcuts like a normal user).  Finally, I agree with the other review that the bumps on the pad are distracting and lead to errors.
3) Sound - not great to begin with and one time when I accidentally had two sounds start at once it decided that it would never again play anything at full volume.  I tried for an hour to find out why and looked through the troubleshooting for the sound card and the sound driver.  No dice.
All in all, it is obviously a cheaply made part that would probably fail in more ways if I kept it any longer.  Two weeks is enough.  I want my $1000 back.

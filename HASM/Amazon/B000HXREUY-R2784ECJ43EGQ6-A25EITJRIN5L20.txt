Title: So it works; is that all there is?
Content:
When I first opened the package, I was... 
...whelmed.
The padded gear bag's plastic liner is brittle. It cracked and wouldn't hold water after the first week. The heating element is merely a coil of soft copper tubing poked into a sheet-metal box. The D-cell-powered 1/4-scale model sump pump caused laughter.
It works.
We now take showers inside our pop-up truck camper *in the winter*. We use the existing 12V water pump by force-fitting the input hose over the sink faucet while the heater is on the stove burner. When the water is really cold, we have to cycle the pump on and off (not recommended by the instructions, but then neither is using the thing inside on my inside stove, right?)
I could probably rig one up with $25 ~ $50 in hardware. But it would take half a day or more and probably look like a kluge. So, for a hundred extra bucks I get to have a camping shower that works. 
Fair enough, at least it works.
EDIT: Somebody just taught me how to use a garden variety tank sprayer, filled with warm water, as a camp shower. This is such a better idea, that I am abandoning this piece of equipment and moving to the tank sprayer. Just sayin'...

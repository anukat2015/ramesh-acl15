Title: Nikon D40x w/18 to 55 telephoto and 55 to 200 telephoto lens
Content:
My advice to those like me who was having trouble with all the bells and whistles and brain overtaxing of this camera is to go to the computer and the NIKON D-40X WEBSITE.  Play the tutoring movie [1st line] over and over and over again, any chance they get.  Take it slow, it will come to you.  Repation is the key.
Then after you have gotten some of the basics down, go to the second line of the tutorial, which gives you a choice of modes and such.
I know they say to just go out and start taking pictures, but I found that, if I slow down and go over and over the tutorial video.
My experience with other cameras that I owned, was to go to AUTO and start.  I got lazy and complacent with the AUTO mode and was happy there.  But this camera has so much to offer, you would be better off with a point a shot type camera.
Hope this helps.

Title: great buy in Sept.
Content:
I bought two of these on Amazon in September for $22.11 each with free shipping. At the price I got them for they were a great buy. Lots of safety features and not any louder than any other small ceramic heater I have had. Plus this comes with a remote that is nice to have. As for the price of $55.22 that they are now at in October I would have passed on these and just gone with a cheaper heater with basic features.

Title: Tried the rest-found the best!!
Content:
Between my husband and I, we have had many many coffee makers over the years.  We received this one as a gift and boy are we happy.  It is so simple to use yet jam packed of great features.  The charcoal filter and gold filter insert are the best- no more running out of coffee filters!!  It brews the perfect cup of coffee every time and the carafe is a dream -very easy to pour and handle.  I haven't noticed the dreaded &quot;condensation problem&quot; and am unaffected by fingerprints left on the stainless steel.  Bottom line is this coffee maker is tops.  I even bought one for my parents and thay rave about it as well.  Highly recommended!!

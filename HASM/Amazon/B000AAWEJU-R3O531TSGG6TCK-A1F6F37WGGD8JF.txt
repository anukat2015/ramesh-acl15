Title: exellent product, exellent company
Content:
the product is great, though i haven't used it to vacuum anything extraordinary, so really i can't say whether its really strong or not.  but it has an excellent design.  its light weight, the wheels swivel such that it never gets stuck.  
the company - Witbecks - is great, as i didn't even realize that the vacuum was being sent overnight DHL at no extra charge (maybe it was 2 days, but i got it much faster that i expected)

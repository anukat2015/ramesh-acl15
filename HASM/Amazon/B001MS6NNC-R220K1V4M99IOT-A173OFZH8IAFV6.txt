Title: Wonderful!
Content:
I've had this laptop for about two weeks and I love it.  Whren I turn it on, the start-up time is about 5 seconds then I can go straight to the internet.  My last laptop was a Dell and it took about seven or eight minutes to go through the start-up process.  Also the keyboard is solid where the Dell keys were mushy.  My only frustration is with Windows Vista because I'm not able to easily find some programs.....I ordered a Windows Vista for Dummies so hopefully that will help.

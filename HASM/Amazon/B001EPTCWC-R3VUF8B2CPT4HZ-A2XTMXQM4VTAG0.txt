Title: Love It!
Content:
First MP3 player for me, up until now I still used my old Sony Walkman.  So being used to having the FM option, the Zune was the perfect fit for me!  Also bought one for my husband and we both love it.  The size is perfect and the features all work well, the sound is great and as I knew we would, we love the FM feature.  Was a cinch to download the CD's onto our computer and then onto the device.  With the box it comes in, the only way to charge the device is through your computer.  I found (on Amazon) a great, inexpensive package of a wall charger, car charger, and a rubber skin to hold the Zune which can affix to a belt clip, arm band or hanging strap.  Very, very happy with my Zune and accessories!!

Title: Sansa is a good deal
Content:
I bought this item for my 12-yr-old. I initially downloaded her CD selections to the MP3 and she took it from there. Very easy to operate. The FM tuner is a bonus. My daughter's also enjoying the recording feature. I think the Sansa is a good deal for the money and a good test of responsibility for higher-priced items in the future.

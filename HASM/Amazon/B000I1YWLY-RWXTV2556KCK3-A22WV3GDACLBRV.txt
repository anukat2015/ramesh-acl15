Title: Works great!
Content:
I have always had bags for my vacs, so I am still getting used to having to empty the canister, as I have had this unit for only 2 months.  It certainly seems to have more power...but I do have to empty the canister more than once to finish the entire house.  
It is VERY quiet for cleaning floors.  Using the rug cleaner is not as loud as my old vac, and cleans better.
I like the idea of not worrying about getting more bags before I run out!

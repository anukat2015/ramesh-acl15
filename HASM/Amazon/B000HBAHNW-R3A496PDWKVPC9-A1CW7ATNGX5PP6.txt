Title: Excellent vacuum cleaner!
Content:
I've only had my Callisto with the SEB236 power brush for a week. I had bought a used Kirby Ultimate G off of eBay just a month ago. I had always wanted a Kirby. Then, I discovered Miele thanks to killdirt.com. I bought mine from an allergy website, tax free and free shipping! 
Maneuvering this vacuum is easy as far as canisters go. I have no problem cleaning my stairs with it. I also am able to clean my stairs with the SEB236, then go around the edges with the crevice tool. 
Changing tools is a snap. Suction is phenomenal, so is the sound at full power. It isn't nearly as loud as other vacs. I also have a Dyson Animal. I don't want another bagless vacuum. The Dyson only has suction on one side. I also can't stand the ratchet sound the Dyson makes on rugs!  
I love the hard floor brush. I have hardwood and ceramic tile. Even the wheels on the canister seem harmless on my hardwood floor. 
I wanted a vacuum that was true HEPA, meaning sealed so that all exhaust exits via the HEPA filter. If you're vacuuming, why should ANY dust be blown back into the air to settle on your furniture, back into the carpet, and into your lungs? 
I bought the Callisto because I didn't need the more expensive models with the electronic suction control on the hose and the indicator to tell me when to change the HEPA filter. I can make a note of that. The Callisto is all you need if you want a Miele vacuum with a power nozzle. 
The SEB 236 nozzle has very cool lighting. It also has 5 levels of height adjustment. Excellent vacuum!

Title: ugly but tough little thing
Content:
I  hook this up to my car through the tape deck.(yes both my cars have tape decks)
The good: runs on AAA battery, long battery life. I use this every day on my  7.5miles 20mins commute, and occasional jogging/exercise. Supports chinese character.  Support wma. Plug this into the USB port(windows xp) and it acts as an flash drive where you direct drag and drop files. No crappy itune needed. I bought this to replace the Dell Ditty which was smaller but unreliable, and also as an alternative to my Ipod which doesnt support wma. Sound quality is decent, but I dont really care for my radio talk shows. And unlike ipod, I can leave this ugly thing in my car without worrying someone gonna break in. Becasue of the size, the main buttons are very easy to press which is important when you are driving.
 
The bad: The designer needs to go back to design school as this is one ugly piece of equipment. For a 512M unit this is pretty big. The battery life indicator is not accurate when I use my 1.2v NiMH battery, it shows full life when it is about to die. 
 
Bottom line: Good for old-school people like me, not for show-offs. No custom rechargable battery or painful softwares to worry about. But dont hang it on your neck unless you want to make a fashion anti-statement.

Title: Beware of the low reviews on this product
Content:
The other two reviews that gave it a low rating had nothing to do with the laptop.  It was their experiences that were the issue not the laptop itself.  If you turned down this laptop based on those reviews you would be missing out on a very nice machine.  
This is an excellent laptop and I highly recommend it.  I've had mine for a couple of years now and have never had a problem with it.  I have upgraded to Win7 since then and have a total of 4GB RAM (which is the max for this laptop hardware wise).  
I am in IT field and need a reliable, ultra-portable laptop that has plenty of 'horse-power' to run several applications that I rely on.  The X200 fits that perfectly.  
I am fairly rough on my laptop and yet it still runs without a problem.  
Pros:  Light-weight, portable, great battery life, reliable, nice features (roll cage to protect against bumps, spill-resistant keyboard), price is just right, Lenovo's website for downloads (drivers and software) is always up to date
Cons:  The finish on the top of it is not that durable.  The lid on mine got scratched up a little bit.  I ended up buying a 'skin' to go on the top of it to hide the scuff marks.

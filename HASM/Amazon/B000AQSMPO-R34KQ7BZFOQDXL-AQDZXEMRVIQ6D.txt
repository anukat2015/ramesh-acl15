Content:
I love it... perfect for us...  I have a cup of coffee or two in the am, thats it.. I order the coffee from Amazon and in the winter pick up good chocoalate flavored cocoa from Bed bath and beyond..  I love this machine, best kitchen gadget I have ever bought.  almost 3 years, and I know 4 of my family members have bought them, now we switch of flavors we like and all...

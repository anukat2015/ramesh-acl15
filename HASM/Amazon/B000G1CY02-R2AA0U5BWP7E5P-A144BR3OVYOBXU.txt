Title: nice product but could use a fan
Content:
I bought this product(DeLonghi HHP1500) at a great price ($59.99) and it puts out a lot of heat compared to a 1500 watt coil heater.  Since I am using it in a fairly large room I find that it works better if I direct the air from a small fan over the heater to disipate the heat around the room.  This heater does not have a fan in it.  I use it with the attachable legs because it radiates a lot of heat from the back of the unit and I worried about heat damage to the wall with the wall mount bracket.  I use it about 6 to 7 hours a day to raise the tempature from about 64 degrees F to around 70 degrees F in a basement computer room/family room.

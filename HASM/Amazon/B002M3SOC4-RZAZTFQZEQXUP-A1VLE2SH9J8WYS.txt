Title: All the fun of an IPhone without having to deal with AT&T
Content:
I purchased this product a month ago, and couldn't be more pleased.  
Pros:
1) All the Apps of an IPhone without AT&T
2) Connects to wireless networks easily.  
3) Internal speaker that I didn't realize was built in is very nice and has good volume
4) Controls and set-up are very easy to navigate.
5) MUCH less glitchy than the 1st gen IPhone I bought (and 2 months later sold) back in 2007.
6) Battery life is fantastic.
Cons:
1) I cannot at this time connect it to my Linux based computers, so I still have to keep Windows(yuck) on one of them for now. 
2) Only charging option (that comes with unit) is via computer (which has to be on).  You can buy after-market charger plugs for under $10.
Still, I view this product as a 5 star.

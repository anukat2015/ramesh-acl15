I absolutely love this camera.  My only lens at the moment is a Tamron 18-250mmm ... BTW an EXCELLENT lens.  Pics are as sharp as they say, and I like the program that comes with it.
My only complaint is a lack of an HD output for hooking it right to my HDTV.
January 2008 - Added a Sigma 170 - 500 zoom, and my love for this camera (and my lenses) grows.  Spectacular sunset pics in Mexico ... next stop is Egypt, but the ultimate tests will my jungle/island trip this summer.
Tripod needed for use with the long lenses.

Title: Great heater
Content:
This heater really heats up a room in a hurry.  To provide some context, my kitchen is in the vicinity of 120 square feet, and it only takes 5 minutes or so to heat up after turning this heater on.  As advertised, it is indeed silent.  And even when first turning it on, it didn't emit that nasty new-heater smell.  This heater is a great value and I'm glad I bought it.

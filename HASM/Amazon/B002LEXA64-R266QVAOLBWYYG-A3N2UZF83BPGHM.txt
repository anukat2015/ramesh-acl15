Title: Almost perfect, but the touchpad....
Content:
I've only spent about 5 hours with the blue 1410 that I bought here on Amazon Friday, but am generally quite pleased. It feels solid, runs quietly, accomplishes all I ask of it and I'm not sure I'll ever have to recharge it 8>). I'm glad I held off on buying a netbook before this. I'm even considering using this as my primary cpu.
But I've found the trackpad troublesome and I wonder if others have. I guess that's why I'm writing this review! The main problem is that the touchpad is kinda small and is flush with the 1410's top surface, while the "mouse" buttons are also flush with the top and run to the front edge. Whenever my left thumb touches the pad as I mouse around with my right forefinger, the pad reacts and the cursor jumps back. I have turned off the multitouch features, and that helped a lot, but it is still a bit "twitchy". I suppose I'll adapt and learn to keep my button finger away from the touchpad until I need it, but it has been a real annoyance. Anyone else?

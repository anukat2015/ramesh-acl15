Title: Pretty Good Value but ...
Content:
Some of the reviews give the impression that this little heater will heat a small room but I disagree. I ordered one because of the positive reviews and the low price and I am happy with it but please get real. Using the 400 Watt setting and putting it on the floor directly in front of you creates a silent lower leg warming device that's very compact and looks to be fairly well built considering the low price. It's less effective up higher and using both bulbs(800 Watt Setting) will spin your electric meter around arousing the attention of your landlord as would a device that had a fan and made noise. So in that regard this is a very handy unit. According to the directions there are no user serviceable parts so when it fails or one of the bulbs burns out, you'll have to send it back to the factory with a $15.00 dollar check for handling(if the failure occurs in the 1st year but not in the 1st 30 days). Keep in mind that that does not include your shipping charges which should be in the ten dollar range. If the failure occurs in the 1st 30 days all you have to do is ship it to the store you bought from for a refund or replacement(you'll still be out the shipping). If the failure occurs between years two and three then the handling charge goes up to 20 dollars. For all practical purposes this means that when the product fails, it's history. This includes a bulb burning out.

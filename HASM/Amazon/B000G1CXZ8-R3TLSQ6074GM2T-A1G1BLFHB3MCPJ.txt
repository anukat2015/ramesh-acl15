Got this heater yesterday for our 10' X 20' enclosed back porch area where we watch TV. It's going back to supplier. It has a "bad" hot electric smell resulting in headaches for me. It's not thermostat controlled on low (low is noisy enough, but on high it's much worse), the DVR/TV remote changes the temperature and the timer settings whenever the DVR/TV remote is used & the display light goes off within seconds so it impossible to tell what the heater is doing. The display numbers for the timer are so small that I had to get on my knees in front of it to read the setting. I could write more, but those are enough reasons to stay away from this heater.

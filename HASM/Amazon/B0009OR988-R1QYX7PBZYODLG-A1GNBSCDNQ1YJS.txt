Title: Metropolitan  Professional Vacuum
Content:
The Metropolitan Vacuum could suck the stripes off a zebra....great product....and great customer relations from this family run business. I appreciated their humble apology when they apologized for AUTOSUPERMART's rude customer relations. (see below)  
DO NOT pruchase from AUTOSUPERMART.  I had to work with them via phone and have never been so poorly, disrespectfully , rudely treated in a sales/customer relationship ever.  Give  [...]  a try.....it HAS to be better than AUTOSUPERMART.  The help desk at Autosupermart was curt and only used one word answers and responses when I was trying to understand how to get a return lable.  He hung up on me.   I had to call them 4 times to get a return lable.  When the Manager (Bill) learned of the poor communication I recieved at the help desk, HE TOO was out-of-line justifying the unprofessional, punk, rude kid (Jason) who worked the help desk.  Bill didn't listen to the truth, but rather told me I was wrong and a liar.  Never did Autosupermart us words like, Please, Im sorry , Thank you.  I will not soon forget this stupifying expierience. I am still befuddled by these people.   Again,  Try [...].

Title: Bissell knows how to suck pet hair and dirt!  Great vacuum.
Content:
Length:: 0:56 MinsThe Bissell is a rocking vacuum. It pulled up dirt and hair from the carpet we never knew about. Cheaper then Dyson and if your looking for a vacuum that can really pull up the nasties from the carpet this is it, did I mention its bagless so you do not have that extra cost?

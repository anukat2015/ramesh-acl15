Title: Best Vacuum Ever!
Content:
I love this thing!  I spent months shopping for a vacuum and reading reviews and this won even factoring in the price and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  I've use an Oreck, I've used a Dyson, I've used Hoovers and in comparison this is heaven.  The power head on the carpet attachment can be turned on and off independently which has kept me from killing things I run over many times. Even on the highest suction setting it only makes about half the noise of my old vacuum, it is so quiet I have no worries about disturbing my neighbors (I'm in a large apartment building).  And possibly my favorite thing is that there are no longer things being thrown back at my feet, like the gravel they sand the roads with.   I've had it for about 3 months and I've only gone through one bag so far even though I vacuum pretty often.  Out of random curiosity I weighed it and the bag weighed 7.5 pounds, so they hold a lot and are not going to break.

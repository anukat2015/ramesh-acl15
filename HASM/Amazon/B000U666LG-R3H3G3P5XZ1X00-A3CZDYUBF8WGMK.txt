Content:
Having read a very favorable review in the New York Times, I took the plunge and ordered the Honeywell HZ-7200 Cool Touch Oscillating Heater. I've been thoroughly pleased with it so far. It throws off a lot of heat; it's quiet and relatively lightweight (face it, you'll probably want to move your space heater around); and the price was considerable lower than other heaters. The only thing keeping me from a giving a full 5-star rating was my perverse sense that nothing short of the sublime was worthy of such a ranking--which is hard to imagine in the case of a lowly space heater (however nice it might be).

Title: Great Computer!!!
Content:
I recently purchased this laptop to replace my Dell which stopped working after 2.5 years. This laptop has GREAT features, very solid build, and is extremely fast. I have absolutely no complaints and would recommend this laptop to anyone. The sound is excellent and I especially love the LED backlit keyboard! Toshiba has excellent reliability reviews and this is an all around great product. I opted for the AMD processor vs the slower Intel with the BlueRay player. I have a PS3 with BlueRay and I really don't see myself needing a BlueRay player on my laptop. I would recommend a Square Guard warranty just for added protection. I purchased the 3 year warranty for only $100.00! WHY WOULDN"T YOU GET THE 3 YEAR WARRANTY FOR ONLY $100????

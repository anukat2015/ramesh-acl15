Title: NEVER BUY THIS!
Content:
What a disappointing product!!!
I was given this as a graduation gift. Engraved and all. Unfortunately I will never use it. Ever.
The ONLY way you can control the iPod is with the accompanying headphones. The headphones are uncomfortable, fall out, and produce poor sound quality. I have a pair of Sony headphones which I swear by and would never ever consider downgrading to the unusable Apple phones. Honestly, I don't even understand how Apple could make such a crappy product. (Don't they test these things?!)  
There are options to getting around the headphone issue such as paying another $30 for an adapter... But this iPod is supposed to be about being small and sleek and adding an adapter or case would just screw that up. I got the stainless version (available at [...] only) and would hate to just cover it up with plastic! Eww.
UGH! I am so disappointed. I feel foolish too because I usually spend hours researching products before I buy, but this purchase (well my dad bought it at my request) was such a rash decision and I regret not doing my due diligence. ::sigh::
The older shuffle model, however, is great! I still have one of those for my on-the-go/exercise routine, thank GOD!

Title: Been using daily for over 3 years
Content:
This coffee maker is amazing! Very durable (my friend put the grounds into the water compartment when she was drunk) After cleaning it still works perfectly. Simple to use and design is very modern and doesn't look out dated. The filter and pot are great quality. (not dents in filter and the handle isn't wobbly after all this use, also pot has no coffee stains and the glass is very durable.

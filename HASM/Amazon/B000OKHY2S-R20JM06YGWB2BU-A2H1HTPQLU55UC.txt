Title: ok
Content:
does not measure up to an air conditioner and it adds humidity to the air which makes it feel hotter but it guess it would be better in a place that does not get so hot here in phoenix the only thing that really helps is the AC
the air that blows out of it does feel cooler then the air going into it though plus it makes a good fan and has a good airflow

Title: The BEST Indoor Light Digital SLR
Content:
I actually have the K100D, not the Super, but the comments apply to either model.  My daughter does gymnastics and the pictures I take are taken indoors without flash.  In order to get the most benefit from this camera, DO NOT settle for the kit lens that comes with it.  That lens (18-55mm) is fine for outdoor snapshots, but to really get the most of this camera, get a fast prime lens (50mm f1.4, 50mm f1.7, 50mm f2.0, 35mm f2.0, 28mm f1.8, 20mm f1.8, etc.)  This camera can take pictures that I believe NO OTHER SLR can do and has 3 distinct advantages over other SLRs.  
1. Shake reduction - This allows the camera to be reduce movement due to the user and keeps the photos sharper.  It can be used with ANY Pentax-mount lens you put on, saving potentially huge amounts on lenses (check out others stabilized lens prices and you'll see).  Some of the other Pentax bodies also have this feature and I understand that there may even be a higher degree of reduction with models like the 10D.
2. More sensitivity - You may think a 6 megapixel image is a disadvantage, but it allows the sensor to have an ISO range of 200 MINIMUM to 3200, because the sensors are larger and need less light, meaning more speed.  No other currently made body that I know of has this kind of sensor sensitivity, although some bump the ISO up as high or higher with expensive, perhaps more advanced (but I don't think better results) technology.
3. More lens usage - there are more lenses available that fit on this camera than on any other brand, by far, and these lenses are often far less cost than what the new types cost.  I've found that manual focus lenses are not always a disadvantage, and in fact, often get me better and faster pictures, since I can set the focus and not have to wait for the camera to do the focus function.  Other Pentax bodies do the same. 
So, if you want a camera for indoor shooting with the most sensitivity and not spend an arm and a leg, get this one and get a prime lens or two to go with it.  You'll not only be amazed at what you can shoot, but so will your friends.  I only hope Pentax comes out with a full-frame 14 megapixel version of an equivalent sensor.

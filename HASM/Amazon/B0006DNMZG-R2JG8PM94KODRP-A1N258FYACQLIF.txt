Title: Consumer reports scores well
Content:
Consumer reports gives this a very high rating among space heaters. I have not noticed anything particularly special about it, but it seems to be doing the job. Time will tell, I think... alot of space heaters we've had just die out after a season or two it seems... will have to see how this guy holds up!

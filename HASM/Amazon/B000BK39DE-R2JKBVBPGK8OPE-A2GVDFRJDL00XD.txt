Title: Maybe,  but not for a beginner
Content:
All I know about photography was from a class I took in High school 10 years ago. I bought the Olympus, for its price considering the 2 lenses. The menu was confusing even after I read the manual. I didn't love the lenses that much, there was too much play in the manual focus, and the view finder was pretty hard to see into.
I went to a camera store and played around with a Nikon and a Canon, both had better menus, the Nikon had the better manual focus. So I ended up with a Nikon. The manual focus was like black and white, compared to the E-500.
The camera itself was a great size, and fit well in my hands. The nikon (D50) feels a bit heavier, but I think it could be the 300mm lens. Maybe if I weren't a beginner I'd feel better about it, but I'd like my husband to be able to play with it too, and the Nikon is a lot easier to use.

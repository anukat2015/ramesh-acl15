Title: N61JQ-X1 = 2010 Most awesome laptop $ for $
Content:
ASUS N61JQ-X1 is the best laptop by far.  I replaced all my gaming systems & desktop with = this laptop & a STEAM account.  I wirelessly game on my 2009 52" Sharp LCD HDTV & Sony/Polk -hybrid DolbyDigital 5.1 home theatre system [multi kW theatre].  Sometimes I game in the 7.2 Klipsch/Polk -hyrbrid movie theatre.
I know about games: I have a PS3 w/ 20+ Games HDMI & FiberOptical, Xbox360 HDMI w/ 500+ games & FiberOptical addon [gamertag CONTRA2634AD], i7-975EE desktop @ 4.8GHz on 24/7 Phase Change (TRI-SLI HDMI & SB Fatal1ty Titanium FiberOptical), and I auction vintage videogame lots of 100s of games.
N61JQ-X1 has Radeon 5730 1GB, a powerful DirectX 11 graphics card.  This Radeon 5730 is at least 33-50% faster than the nVidia GT 220, 230, 240, 320, 350 you'll find in similar under-$1000 LENOVO, DELL, HP competitors.  Also, the 5730 is only about 20% slower than a GTS 360m, the modern over-$1500 laptop champ.
From continuous 24/7 use since my March 1, 2010 purchase, I have experienced no crashes, no bugs, no issues at all.  I play all the modern STEAM games: AvP, CODMW2, Borderlands, DragonAge, Fallout3, RE5, GTA4, Crysis, Metro2033, STALKER, L4D2!  Full speed.  GT 360m laptop cannot even play minutes without overheat freeze/crash!
This is a flawless, lightweight computer that leaves nothing lacking for my use!  I even upgraded my house to the fastest Wireless-N Buffalo Router on the market to PC game wirelessly from now on.
Moreover, I upgraded this laptop to the MAXIMUM!  8GB DDR3-1333 SODIMM, Sony BC-5600S SlotLoading BluRay, 128gb Q4-2009 Samsung SSD, 64GB FileMate ExpressCard SSD, 32GB "Class 10" SDHC, Windows 7 x64 Ultimate, USB3.0 1TB 2.5" Laptop Harddrive, Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000, Bluetooth Keyboard, Xbox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows, 8' HDMI Cable.
**I even RETURNED the best LAPTOP COOLER on the market because this laptop DOESN'T NEED IT!!!!!**
**HERE ARE MY GAME SETTINGS in all games ~60 FPS **:  SET RESOLUTION TO 1280x720 @ 60Hz ON YOUR DESKTOP & IN ALL GAMES [720p], Shadows = OFF, AA/FSAA = OFF, Water = OFF, Reflections = OFF, vSync = OFF, PostProcessing = OFF, TerrainDetail = LOW, [& Adjust sound quality if needed].  If you can't turn those settings off, adjust them to their lowest settings.  Almost every other setting can be turned up MAXIMUM in most games.

Title: Battery life a joke
Content:
While I am not tech savvy, I appreciate this laptop as easy to use and fast. I primarily wanted this unit for use traveling watching DVD's on airplanes and being able to surf the net away from home. I had bought a 17" Tosiba with this in mind, but it is as big as a house, and is truly a replacement for a desktop computer. I called Amazon computer tech for advice, and she strongly recommended this unit. I asked about battery life and she told me it was rated for 6 hours. Great! The only thing is that the battery only lasts two hours, so I bought a second battery as a spare and IT only lasts two hours too.

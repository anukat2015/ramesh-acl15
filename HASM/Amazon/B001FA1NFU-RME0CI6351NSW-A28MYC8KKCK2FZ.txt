Title: Smaller size...but
Content:
The 4th generation Ipod Nano has superior storage, video, and new features that were not with previous Ipod Nanos.  However, there is no one stand out feature to set it apart from the Ipod family.  It seems to be the middle child of Apple.
For storage capabilities and decent video, the Ipod Classic seems the way to go.  The video on the Nano is too convex looking to my eyes.  What about music to go?  The Ipod Shuffle is the best bet with the clip.  The Nano, by contrast, has no clip-on piece.  As for the shake out a Genius Play List feature; for myself, it isn't all that special of a bell or whistle.  For video, internet, gaming, and music it is the Ipod Touch.  In short for most consumer needs the Ipod Nano is not a standout in any one area.
The Ipod Nano does have a sleek design and a smaller size.  It will fit into most tech cases.  The biggest drawbacks are the convex screen and, like the Ipod Mini, its touch sensitivity.  You can inadvertently turn on your Ipod Nano while it's in your handbag and find out you have drained the batteries.
It has the Apple quality behind it.  I just would recommend other Ipods ahead of this one.  Sorry, Nano:-(

Title: Okay but not as great as in the reviews
Content:
I've purchased this vacuum partially due to the raving reviews here.  However, my expectations were not fully met.  While I'd agree that this is a good vac for floors and small rugs, I'd not commend the sucking power of the motor, and holding it on the showlder does not get comfortable with prolonged use and when you need to bend (it falls off).  
In general for the price it's a good deal but it's useful to remember: you get what you pay for...

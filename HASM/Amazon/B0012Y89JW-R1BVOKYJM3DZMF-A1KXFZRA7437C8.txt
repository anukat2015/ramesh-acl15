Title: Awesome camera...
Content:
My daughter and I have been wanting to get a DSLR for several years but were always concerned about the price for the resolution we were seeking. The Canon XSi is lightweight, comfortable handling, and at 12.2 mp it has the quality image we have been seeking. My daughter shot over 300 picture on Christmas as we visited various members of the family. She was even able to capture some awesome sunset images while driving in the car with the image stabilation feature.

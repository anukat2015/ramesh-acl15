Title: Delivers the good for the price and more
Content:
I went with the reviews for the product and am not sorry.
Its quite an amazing pretty looking thing and for this price it comes with 3 useful attachments too. The carpet cleaning attachment pulls you along like a runaway train, no pressure or effort required from you to push and pull this one.
Dont know why but it comes with a "headlight" am sure no one vacuums their room with the lights off but it does look nice.
The canister is easy to remove clean and fit back in. The attachments are all easy to manage plus its got a retractable chord.
I had got a Dirt Devil from a Walmart nearby and its the worst piece of equipment ever. It stopped working right after just 5 uses and after 4 it started emanating a burning smell. This one has proved to be a good buy (so far)! I might come back and change this to 5 stars after a couple of weeks.
I got mine on a Friday sale for a good deal (this retails for around 250-300 in some of the retailers), if any of you look to buy it you might want to try it out on a Friday to see if it goes down and it does. Thanks Amazon for helping me save some bucks!

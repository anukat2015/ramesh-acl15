Title: great build quality!
Content:
The last time I purchased a laptop was almost 2.5 years ago. Style and features seem to have changed considerable, as they had the previous 2.5 years, which is slightly less than the extra warranties I had purchased on the then current notebooks!
This particular notebook seems to be influenced by the new MacBook air because it is 1 inch thick, and the net-book revolution because of battery-life and general build. Though it has a 13.3 diagonal screen, it at about 3.5 pounds and is about 1 pound lighter than the 12.1 HP tablet it is currently supplementing.  
I say supplementing because the Acer has no CD/DVD drive, nor bluetooth, nor ExpressCard; but neither has Firewire.
The screen is very clear and bright and the processor very snappy. Bloatware seems pretty limited. The price CAN BE right.
It runs COOL and the battery life seems very promising!

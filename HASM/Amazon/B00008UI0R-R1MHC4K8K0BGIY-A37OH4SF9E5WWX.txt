Title: Sooo worth the hassle!!!
Content:
I have had several vacuums over the last 15 years...the inexpensive ones just seemed to burn up after a few months of use.  So I purchased a little more expensive Progressive upright (made by Panasonic)...enjoyed it for a couple of years, but needed something that I could reach under beds and in tighter areas.  So, I purchased a $300 Progressive canister, and enjoyed the versatility...until things started to break...had to replace the cord twice and now, splits and leaks in the expensive to replace hose.  I purchased this Hoover to replace my Progressive and WOW!!!  After taping the splits in the hose of my Progressive I compared these two side by side and this won hands down.  Yes you have to empty the canister and I use an air compressor to blow out the filter once a week, but sooo worth it to have SPOTLESS carpets thoughout my home.  The only downfall is that it would be nice to have a soft dusting brush to use for furniture, blinds, etc.  This only comes with a very firm useless upholstery brush. The powered hand tool is effective on stairs.  This also comes with a crevice tool and hard floor attachment which are fair.
A REALLY GREAT PURCHASE!!!

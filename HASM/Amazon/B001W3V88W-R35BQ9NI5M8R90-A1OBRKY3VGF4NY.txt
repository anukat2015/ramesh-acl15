Title: Finally a great cup of coffee!
Content:
I have purchased single-serve brewers in the past, and I've never been satisfied with the weak coffee they brewed.  Not so with my Tassimo!  It's fast, remarkably quiet, and fabulous at producing a strong (not bitter!) cup of coffee.  I've tried several brands of the discs, and they're all delicious.  Clean-up consists of pulling out the disc and throwing it away.  I love it, and I think it was well worth the money.  I'm so glad a friend recommended it to me.

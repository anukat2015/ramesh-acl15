Title: Swiss Army knife of Swamp Coolers
Content:
Whatever your weather situation, this does the trick. I've used almost all the functions and my favorite is the humidification function. Being extremely dry in the dessert, this has the ability to maintain a very very precise level of moisture in your immediate surrounding.  I'm very impressed. Just make sure the units has an sufficient fill of water to draw on and you're set. The cooling function is great and so is the heating. Great price and fast shipping.

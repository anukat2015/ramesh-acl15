Content:
Bought this with some reservations based on the negative reviews that I read.  It has worked perfectly for me.  Synced to WMP 10 with no problem.  Have purchased songs online (from Walmart!) and had no problem listening to them on either the H10 or my other iRiver player.  I would recommend this player to others and have had good luck with three different iRiver MP3 players that I own.

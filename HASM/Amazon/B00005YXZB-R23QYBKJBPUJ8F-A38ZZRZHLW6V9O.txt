Title: Fantastic travel companion!
Content:
My wife and I travel outside the U.S. with some frequency.  I purchased a Zelco 1-cup coffee maker about 3 years ago, and we have taken it to Asian and European countries where in many hotel rooms the most that can be expected is a way to heat water.  This coffee maker has been a life-saver, from the standpoints of having a fresh cup of coffee in the morning and improving my wife's disposition.  It has always functioned well, and it makes a great cup of strong coffee.
A previous review alluded to the on-off button not working.  I have found that the button sometimes is "on" due to pressure against it by other items in my suitcase.  After that first brew, it works just fine.

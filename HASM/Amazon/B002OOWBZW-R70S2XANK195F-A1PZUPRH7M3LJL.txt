Title: An excellent computer
Content:
We have owned 4 Toshiba laptops over the last 10 years.  All 4 are still functioning. This small laptop is exactly what I wanted.  It is "grab and go", light, and easily put in a large purse or small valise.  The battery is long lived and will last all day at work with periods of inactivity.  It runs Microsoft Office, Excel and Access with very little hesitation.  Wonderful machine..

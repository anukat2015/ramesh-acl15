Title: Great Camera, Great Value
Content:
I'm 15 and just starting out with photography. I purchased this camera with the kit lens (even though I've heard many people say not to do this), for convenience. It's way more than I expected. Very easy to handle, very good price.
Overall, for a starter DSLR, it's awesome.

Title: Like the smell of burning plastic? Use this!!
Content:
I bought this from a local retailer, I'm intending on returning it. I've been using the fan feature, which is awesome if not a little loud. But today was my first time using the heater feature, and I tell you I already have a migraine. I'm extremely sensitive to smell and this thing smells like the plastic is being set on fire. I've got it set on the 1st heating setting cranked about half way up, and two feet away from my legs I can't feel a thing. It's been on for at least three hours too! What a piece of junk.

Title: Button to choose heat settings doesn't work well at all
Content:
Heater very quiet when working, but fan blades started to hit plastic housing soon after purchase, making very annoying noise. Push button used to choose heat/fan settings not reliable after 2 months. 
After two years, can't get button to turn heater on at all.
Would never buy another one of these.

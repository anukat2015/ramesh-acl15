Title: REALLY SUCKS
Content:
My Wife and I are impressed with the Dysan DC21 Canister vacuum we just got.  It has terrific suction power and the floor attachment (beater bar) does a very good job of extracting dirt and debris.  It's very compact and has handy little places in the unit to carry the attachment tools.
We used a carpet cleaning unit only 2 weeks before we got the Dysan and there was a surprising amount of dirt, lint and maybe carpet fibers.  If I owned an expensive area rug, I don't think I'd use the beater bar attachment.

Title: AWESOME!!  AMAZING!!
Content:
This camera is amazing.  I have small children (3 and 2 yrs old) who don't sit still very long.  The camera focus and shutter speed are very fast - perfect for capturing children in the moment.  
I also purchased the SanDisk Extreme III CompactFlash Card.  It writes extremely fast.
The automatic settings take fantastic pictures.  I saw some reviews complaining about low exposure on inside shots.  I have not experienced that.
I have taken over 400 pictures since Christmas Day 2007 and I have not had to recharge the battery yet.  
ALL AROUND EXCELLENT CAMERA!

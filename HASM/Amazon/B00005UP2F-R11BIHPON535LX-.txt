Title: Nice looking but not so easy to use
Content:
The overall design of this vaccuum looks great, but not so easy to use.  With little attachments provided, all I can use it for is vaccuuming the carpet.  Also oftentime when I tried to pick it up to move to a different spot, I mistakenly pull off the canister cover instead of vaccuuming itself.

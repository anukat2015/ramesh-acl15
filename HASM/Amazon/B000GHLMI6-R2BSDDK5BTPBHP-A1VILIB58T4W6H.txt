Title: Worked well.....for about a year
Content:
This coffeemaker worked fine for about a year.  Now, it leaks through the heating plate which is screwed onto the bottom of the pot itself.  Totally unusable now, unless I want a counter full of coffee in the morning (which I don't).  I'm hoping to be able to purchase a replacement pot - I haven't seen one on Amazon, but maybe if I go through Hamilton Beach.  Meanwhile....what do I do in the morning? :-(

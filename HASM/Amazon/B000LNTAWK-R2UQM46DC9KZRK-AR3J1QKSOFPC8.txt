Title: An amazing camera for the price.
Content:
The Nikon D200 is an amazing camera. I consider myself an enthusiastic amateur, and the D200 fits my needs more than I could ever imagine. I recommend this to anybody considering a new Nikon, especially since the price is dropping as the D300 is released.
It's fabulous!!!!

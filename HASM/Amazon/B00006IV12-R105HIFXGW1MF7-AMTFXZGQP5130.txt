Title: Great heat, great size, great price, poor user interface
Content:
This is a fairly small heater that puts out a lot more warm air than I'd hoped for. It's perfect to tuck under my desk and warm my toes when the central heat isn't quite doing its job. 
However, it's a bit tedious to use, even once you've figured out how it works and what setting you prefer. There is only one button (and 7 LEDs). The first time you press the button, you get continuous high heat, which is a reasonable default setting. But now to turn it off, you've got to press it 12 more times. Suppose you want to use the thermostat, so it puts out low power heat to keep the temperature at 70 degrees. That's 10 button presses when you turn it on, and another 3 to turn it off again. Seems like adding another button, or a dial or something would have made this thing a lot easier to use. 
I also have my doubts that the thermostat works correctly, but I have not actually tested it with an independent thermometer in hand.

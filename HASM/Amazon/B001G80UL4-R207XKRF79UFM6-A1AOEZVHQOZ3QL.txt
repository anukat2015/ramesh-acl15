Title: Heating Tower
Content:
Bought this past weekend at Menard's for $77 for son's bedroom. So far it has worked great. Quiet! Quick to heat the room up (~11'x15'). Maintains temperature set on digital display (have thermometer in room to verify). Had one of the delonghi radiator style heaters before, but was so noisy that it kept waking our son up. Hopefully it will work well for quite a while (was surprised to read the other posts).

Title: Great for Pet Owners and Hardwood floors
Content:
I love this vaccum. I live in a 3 floor townhouse with mostly hardwood floors and tile. I was trying to keep on top of my cat's shedding with a swiffer but it just wasn't enough. I bought this vacuum in may. I use the parquet floor tool constantly. The vacuum sucks up all the pet hair,dust, cat litter, cast food, dirt etc. You can extend the metal bar. That has been very helpful when vacumming my stairs and also allowing as big a distance as possible when sucking up bugs. The vacuum is light and is more quiet than the average vacuum. (my cat is deathly afraid of vaccuums. and he is just slightly afraid of this one) The bags are a great size. I have been using the first one since I got it in may and it is only 1/2 way full. I would recommend Miele to everyone. The people at the vacuum store told me that out of every 20 vacuums that come in for repair 7 are Dyson and they very very rarely get miele's in for repair. (they sell both miele and dyson) Another bonus of owning a miele is that you can order parts even for vacuums 10+ years old. For other brands you would have to just buy a new vacuum. They are quality machines. You can check out [...]. There is a guy who makes video's and will show you just how good the air filters on the miele's are.

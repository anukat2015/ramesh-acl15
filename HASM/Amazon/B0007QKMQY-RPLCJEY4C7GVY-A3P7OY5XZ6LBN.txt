Title: that last dude is an idiot
Content:
first of all, i dont know of many (if any) dSLR's that can shoot using the LCD.  second, you obviously don't know how to use the camera, b/c if you're getting "washed out" photo's, that's an easy thing to fix using the exposure control.  Also, the color is great on canon dSLR's, you obviously don't know how to control custom WB/saturation (you need to take a photo of a white piece of paper or card at the location and then "set" it as yor custom WB).  Next is the fact that you used the kit lens.  Don't blame the body for a cheap lens (although I think its decent for the wideangle).  Finally, the dust on the sensor is your fault.  you obviously don't know how to check and clean your camera.  if you want a sealed-tight dSLR, you have to spend thousands.  
My advice for you is to stick with point and shoot.  You're not ready for dSLR.

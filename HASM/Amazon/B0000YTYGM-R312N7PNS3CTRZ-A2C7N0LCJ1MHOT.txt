Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
I LOVE my new coffee maker!  It makes coffee fast and keeps the coffee hot for hours.  With coffee makers in the past, I frequently found myself reluctant to drink coffee that had been sitting around for more than an hour because it tasted burnt and was generally cold.  That's not an issue with this coffeemaker because the brewed coffee doesn't just sit there and fry on the burner; rather the carafe holds the heat made from when the coffee was brewing.  You really can't tell the difference in taste or temperature of coffee made 5 minutes ago versus coffee made 4 hours ago.

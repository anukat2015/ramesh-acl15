Title: Love My Camera!
Content:
For years I had a Canon Rebel...purchased this new XTI in time for our trip to Hawaii.  The automatic functions performed beyond expectations.  I took pictures of dolphins using the sports action function...and they are beautiful!  Enlarged to 8 X 10, the clarity is amazing.  The blues are incredible, the greys on the dolphins - delightful.  I plan to take a class to learn to use the manual functions.   It is easy to use, has a large viewing area, and works like a dream.  I can't wait to see what else this camera can do.
I am also very pleased with Amazon...the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition.

Title: Exceeded My Expectations
Content:
I have bought lots of vacuuming and sweeping products in the past 10 years, looking for one that would hold up in New Mexico.  We have lots of dust and sand that comes into the house.  Cleaning the vast amounts of tile in the house and the various rugs required having several vacuums, none of which worked very well (one of them burned out in less than 2 years).
Shopping for a replacement, I wanted one unit that would clean everything--and I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars for it.  A search in Consumer Reports told me that three vacuums were rated as "CR Best Buys".  Two of them were Sears Kenmore units--and cost between $250 and $300.  This Hoover was also a "CR Best Buy".  
I bought it from Amazon.  They had the best price, free shipping, and an additonal discount for opening a Amazon Visa.  In the end, it cost about $140.
Not only was it a great deal, but it works so well I got rid of my upright, cannister, and hand-held vacuums.  It is very easy to use and does a terrific job.  It's almost fun to vacuum now.  
I highly recommend this product and Amazon.com.

I had a Dirt Devil for 3 years then it smoked and broke on me. After doing extensive research on vacuums, more specifically upright HEPA bagless, I decided with this since the reviews were excellent and it seemed to be more similar to a Dyson. 
I bought it at Target because for such a large, heavy, and expensive item I wanted the convenience of returning the product if I became unsatisfied.  Unfortunately I was and returned it for a cheaper Bissell Velocity with a turbo rotating brush extension-a feature this item does not have. The rotating brush is so much more effective in cleaning smaller places. 
The Bissell Velocity simply blew this vacuum away! I was so impressed by how much more suction the Bissell had and it picked up more dirt that the Infinity left behind! My husband even had to get in on the powerful action! 
The Bissell even has a longer hose. I can't believe I almost bought the hype of this vacuum and for only 129.99 the Bissell Velocity is the best vacuum I've ever owned so far! 
Forget about Dyson! You end up paying more to get it fixed in the long run.

Title: Absolute Garbage
Content:
I've had this AC for about one year and I hardly use it. It's much better to wait until the outside cools down and open all the windows. Like many one-hose portable AC units, the Koldfront draws air into the room from the outside or the rest of the house, which effectively creates a negative pressure into the room. The end result is that you bring as much warn air into your space as you cool down. My room is 144 square feet with 8 ft cielings, so it is not a particularly large space. According to my digital thermometer, my room cooled down by one degree after 5 hours of running. It went from 79 to 78 degrees F. After 5 hours, the unit stopped working and just blew warm air. I live in Southern California, which is not a particulalrly humid environment, and outside was only 85 degrees. If you do buy a portable AC unit, MAKE SURE IT IS A 2 HOSE UNIT.

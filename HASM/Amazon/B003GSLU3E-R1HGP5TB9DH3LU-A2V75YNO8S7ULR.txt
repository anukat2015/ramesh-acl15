Title: PC users will be AMAZED
Content:
for awhile i was kind of against macbooks because to me they had just been over priced hunks of metal.  i went in the store a couple times and tried previous models out and was not impressed at all. but when i came in and tried the most recent models out i started looking into them a bit more and was surprised at how it was such a powerful computer.  its AMAZING! when i was on skype with my boyfriend on my hp dv4 i could only run one app at a time or it would start acting crazy. when we got on skype on the macbook i was able to do EVERYTHING with out so much as a hiccup. everything is so FAST and from a PC to mac i had no time adjusting.i am just dazzled by its efficiency. and on top of that i got a student discount on my whole purchase :) one thing to beware of...the battery says 10hrs...so far with settings on average im getting only 6 hours or so,i guess to get the 10 hours u need to have eerything on low.still better than any high performance PC i know of.kudos to apple.

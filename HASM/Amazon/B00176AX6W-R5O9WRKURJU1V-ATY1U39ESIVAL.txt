Title: Great player and Bad software
Content:
The player itself is really good.But to bad its linked to the worse music software i've ever used. I returned mine after 1 day. It can't even get the album artist and tags right. And they dumbed it down so badly that now its annoying and intrusive. Its constantly syching even when you don't want it to. And podcast..If you like podcast be prepared for an hour or more of syching the device. And that means you can't do anything. What i found really annoying is, I use other programs like winamp just to listen to podcast on my pc. This software listed them in my music collection and they were just blank url's with the podcast logo. I didn't want it to sych winamp at all. You really can't do anything with it until Microsoft patches it and who knows when that will be. I would say skip the Zune for now. For me it was a mistake to buy this. And its really to bad. The player is great,but the software kills it. I will never buy any mp3 player that is linked to its own software again(ipod and zune). I bought an Archos 404 and could now be happier.

Title: Bricked after 5 minutes
Content:
Unit was installed and worked perfectly.  For 5 minutes.  After that the lights on the unit died but the lights on the plug stayed on.  Reset/Test buttons on the plug worked fine. Breakers were fine.  
Customer service said to just return it.  
Second one did the exact same thing.
Stay away from this and save yourself some frustration.q

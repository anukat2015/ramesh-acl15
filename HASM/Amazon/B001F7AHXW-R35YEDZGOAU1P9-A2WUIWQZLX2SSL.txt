Title: Best Investment Ever
Content:
Before I got this iPod classic I was using a 1st generation iPod nano.  The 120 GB of storage on the classic allows me to sync all of my current music collection (about 80g) with a lot of room to spare.  I don't have to change out music ever other day as I did with the nano.  The battery on the classic lasts 10x longer than the nano.  The video feature is great for workout videos.

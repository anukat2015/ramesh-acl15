Title: Ineffective.
Content:
I bought this AC partly due to its higher energy efficiency rating. However, my old window AC worked better, although the old one had a lower energy efficiency rating, a  lower BTU rating, and the same wattage rating. By this, I mean portable AC does not cool the air as effectively as the window mount AC.
If you can somehow install a window mount type AC unit, don't buy this. This AC is probably useful for spaces wherein a window AC cannot be used, such as basement, attic, photographic darkrooms, etc. Even then, buy a unit that uses comparable electric power to the window model; don't trust the BTU rating on these portable models. They may be a result of the trick of the measurement condition.
One good thing about this unit is that it keeps replacing a portion of the room air, so that the room air does not get the smell of the air conditioned room, even during a continuous operation of the AC. However, you could probably do this manually with a window type AC, if you open the window a few times a day.
This AC draws air from the back of the unit. Some of the air is used to cool the compressor and blown outside via the duct. In my experience, it is best to run this AC on slow fan (which still runs the compressor at the full power) and remove the cold air away from the AC by using another fan, so that the cold air is not wasted to cool down the compressor.

Title: IS NIICE!
Content:
Okay, so my friend ordered an iPod from amazon. Oo! It came fast. Sweet. Click wheel is nice, screen is good, minimalist design is nice. Hmm....maybe I should get one of these...
OO! Zen Vision M has FM Radio, Voice Recorder, and a better screen the iPod?!?!! WHAT?! It's 35 bucks less than iPod?! Duh! I'ma get ZEN!
Product came in two days. YAY!
Loaded 2500+ songs from Windows Media Player 11 and URGE onto the Zen. Sweet! 3 hours of song syncing and I'm set! Amazing sound quality with Bass Booster on and V-MODA Bass Freq headphones. Way better than my friend's iPod (black 30gb)
Battery Life is fine. Seriously, when do you need 15 hours of playback without charging?
With some DVD ripping software, I've gotten DVD's onto this guy. Honestly, the screen size is fine for movies. The screen is way better than the iPod; I compared Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest with my Zen and my friend's iPod. Pretty awesome difference in favor of the ZEN VISION M! The FM Radio is great, and voice recording is a great for "Note To Self"'s. I'm just so totally bummed I didn't get the 60GB ZEN VISION M; I've loaded up these 30 gigs already! Oh well, still an AMAZING value, I highly recommend for any WINDOWS over iPod. ZEN DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC! Just a note =]
***UPDATE***
Yo, buy a case. The front gets a little scratched up during everyday use. Mhmm...

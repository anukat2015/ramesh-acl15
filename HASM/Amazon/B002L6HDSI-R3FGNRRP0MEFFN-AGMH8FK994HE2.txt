Title: great, but could be better
Content:
This is a great device, the camera takes good movies, the quality of the music and how you pick songs is great. There are 2 things I would improve on: 1st the battery life. 8 hours is good, but doesn't last my whole workday. 2nd let it take pictures. The movies look good, but you can't take still photos. Major flaw on a minor perk. Get this, you won't regret it.

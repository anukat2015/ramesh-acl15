Title: Great Espresso Maker!
Content:
I enjoy making espresso with this machine.  The automatic buttons on the top right hand side are easy to read.  The machine takes about minute or so to warm up the water.  The water on the left side is easily accessible.  This machine doesn't function as nicely as the Nespresso machines, which automatically drop the "cups" into a deposit area in the machine.  The Nespresso machine is more efficient, and smaller.
However, the main benefit of this machine is the possibility of using any ground coffee in the reusable cups.  Great machine, but could be better.

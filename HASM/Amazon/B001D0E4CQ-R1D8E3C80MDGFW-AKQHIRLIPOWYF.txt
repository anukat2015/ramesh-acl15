Title: Good for what I got it for.
Content:
Okay, I'm gonna say this first: I didn't buy this to browse the web with. I tried browsing the web and really, I can do better with my Samsung Instinct s30. What it is good at is storing things, playing music, keeping notes, playing high quality video, and staying alive while you do all of that.
Pros: 250 GIGS of storage!!, long battery life, low price comparatively to any other MP3 players, plays video quite well, touch pad is surprisingly accurate.
Cons: You have to buy plugins to play certain files including .aac*, web browser is slow, some complex flash things (like Hulu) don't seem to work, and the navigation isn't AS smooth as an iPod's but it comes DAMN CLOSE.
The bottom line: it's a hella good deal for what it is. It's 250 gigs for 220 bucks. An iPod classic that doesn't do everything that it does and only has 160 gigs of storage is 250 bucks. An iPod touch that does everything that it does but only has 64 gigs of storage is 400 bucks.
Sure, it may be a bit bigger than an iPod. But it's certainly worth the price, storage, and battery life that you get from it. Over all, it's a really good deal.
*If you are an iTunes user like I am, then your music ripped from CDs will most likely be in .aac format. Fret not, you need not buy the plugin! Go into iTunes and then go to: Edit>Preferences>General>Import Settings and then change from .aac to .mp3

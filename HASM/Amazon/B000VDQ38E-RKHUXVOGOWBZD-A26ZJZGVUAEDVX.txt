Title: It actually works!
Content:
I have an 11 month old daughter and two hairy goldens and needed an item that would actually work to pickup all the hair from the dogs so my daughter didn't crawl through it.
Surprisingly, this one actually works, and even though we have weekly maid service and get our carpets shanmpooed quarterly - I couldn't believe how much hair was captured the first time through the house.
Amazing!

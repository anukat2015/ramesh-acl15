Title: Do Not Waste Your Money
Content:
Please do not buy this computer. I had this computer for two months and the screen is cracked internally. Dell said that I caused the damage and I would have to pay $400 to fix it. I work in social services and I don't have that kind of money. $400 is my rent for the month. I am now using my old Toshiba laptop that I have had for almost 6 years without any issues. I never took the Dell off my desk; it has never dropped. This model in particular has the problem of internally cracked screens, just do some online searches and you will see this problem come up constantly. Stay away from this product.
Update: February 4, 2009
I have not changed my mind about this product.  If I could I would give it one star. My laptop no longer plays any DVDs or CDs; it doesn't recognize the drive.  It's probably a motherboard issue.  And the battery no longer holds a charge. Also I had to get a new AC adaptor because it wasn't working either.  I recommend that you buy something more reliable.  I know I'll be buying a Toshiba for my laptop and I now will build my own desktop computer. 
 
So please don't risk getting a haphazardly made laptop from Dell.  Go buy a Toshiba, Sony, or if you want this is a good time to buy an Apple.
Again BUYER BEWARE.

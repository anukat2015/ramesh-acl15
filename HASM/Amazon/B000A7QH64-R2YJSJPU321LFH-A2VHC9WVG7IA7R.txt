Title: Excellent, MUCH  better than the leading brand
Content:
I've had several cordless vacuums over the years and this is by far the best I've used.  The attachments are great and the unit rarely needs charging.  If you read the directions it says not to store the vac in the charging unit and to re-charge only when the charge gets very low.  They want you to drain the battery before re-charging, which will save the battery life.  I only charge mine about every 2 weeks, depending on the usage.  It's great for a quick cleanup in the bathroom (instead of lugging out the big vac or plugging in a stick vac) or small cleanups here and there.  The roller brush attachment is great on carpeting.  I would highly recommend this vac, you will not be disappointed.

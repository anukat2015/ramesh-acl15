Title: Rio Carbon - Why buy anything else?
Content:
The only other Mp3 player I have had, has been the Rio Cali (128).  Our youngest son (age 12) has one, and our college age son has one.  They are great, but I wanted something that has lots more space in it.  I did lots of research before purchasing the Rio Carbon, and even though some have had some problems with theirs, I decided that I still wanted one.  I will say that this is probably NOT for those who use an MP3 when they workout, or during strenuous physical activity.  I use mine for listening to music when I go for a walk.  I put the headphones on (I use Sony headphones, not the ones it came with), then I slip the Carbon in my jeans pocket, and it sure makes my walk go faster!  I also like to listen at night when I go to bed, so I take it bed with me, and I listen as I fall asleep.  My husband was saying that any type of Mp3 player like this would be more delicate, because it has a hard drive in it, as opposed to removable memory.  
As far as I'm concerned, this is an absolutely awesome Mp3 player.  The sound quality is fantastic, and the software is easy to use.  I wouldn't recommend it for the child in your family, but for the average user, it is the best!

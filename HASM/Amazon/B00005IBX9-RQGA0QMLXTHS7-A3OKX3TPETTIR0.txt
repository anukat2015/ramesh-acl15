Title: still goin strong
Content:
I have been using this machine daily for 4 years. I love it. its consistent and reliable.
  In addition to the gold filter i use a paper filter because the gold one lets too much stuff through it. also, if u like your coffee HOT and dont feel like making a full pot, u would need to let it sit for a few minutes after its ready so that it can get full temperature.

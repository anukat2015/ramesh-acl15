Title: If you like good-tasting coffee, don't buy
Content:
This makes a terribly weak cup of coffee. I was disappointed at the brew quality.  Also, it became annoying to only be able to make one cup of coffee at a time, and always in the same cup. It broke after several months use. I regretted buying it and would have been better off with a thermos. 
If you like good coffee and want just a little at a time, you'd be much better off with a little french press instead.  The Commuter, Double-Shot, Stainless Steel French Press is a good choice.

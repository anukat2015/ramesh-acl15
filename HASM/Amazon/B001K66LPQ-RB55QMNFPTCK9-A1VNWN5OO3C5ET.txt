Title: Great coffee, but what a mess!
Content:
I bought the Hamilton Beach Brew Station Summit at Target a month ago. The coffee is great and I love not having the fear of a broken carafe, but the design is flawed for cleaning. The entire top half lifts off of the water reservoir leaving it open and vulnerable during cleaning. Worse, you have to lift the filter basket off before you can lift the coffee reservoir so it's a three handed cleaning operation. I love the coffee, but the design is quite a step down from the first Brew Station.

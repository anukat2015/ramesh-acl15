Title: Love it
Content:
(This is my mom and dad's account, I'm really only 14, and named Kaylee) I have wanted an iPod for sooooo long. I saved my money and bought one myself, my parents did NOT pay for it. They color is even better than in the picture, which was a pleasant suprise. The earphones are really nice, not like the crapy ones all my friends have on their video and first generation nanos. The outside non-scratch is awesome. I got my iPod on Sept. 29 of 2006, (a friday) and left to go camping less than 4 hours later. Ofcourse I took my iPod with. We camped on DNR land in the middle of no where in our trailor. So I ran around, rode my dirtbike, climbed trees, and a whole lotta other stuff while carrying it in my pocket. I dropped it a few times, and it doesn't have a scratch!!!! The only bad thing is it's so small, and easy to loose. I recomend getting a screen cover though. But you really don't need a case to keep it safe, cuz that would just hide the color of your iPod. It has 4 great games on it, and stores a ton of photos. It loads super fast, and is easy to update. The color screen rocks to the fullest. It's definatly worth the money. Besides, it's a 4g which in my town niether Wal-Mart or Cosco carry, only 2g. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.

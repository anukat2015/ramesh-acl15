Title: nice little heater
Content:
I just bought this heater because of its size. I need for our boat to help the bathroom (head) stay warm and keep moisture out.  The fit is perfect since we have limited counter space.  I wish the heater was a bit stronger though. Heater is only 155 watts which isn't much.  I just read the reviews above.. Hope my heater doesn't stop working in a couple of weeks!

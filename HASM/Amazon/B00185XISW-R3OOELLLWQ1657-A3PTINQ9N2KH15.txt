Title: This heater really works
Content:
Had to put it on an outside wall, which isn't preffered but that was the only option, within an hour room went up 6 degrees.  Easy to install and works and cheap to run.  Like other reviewers, good for supplement heat.  It takes the chill off and I'm in Boston and used it on 22 degree day.  It is quite warm to the touch.  All in all, I have bought 2 and looking to buy 2 more.  ITS WORTH IT......

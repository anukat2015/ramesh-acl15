Title: Replacment parts
Content:
I bought this vacuum about l year ago.  The Air Driven Turbo Brush got so clogged that I had to buy a new one.  TRY TO BUY A NEW ONE ONLINE,  ITS A JOKE!!! I ORDERED THIS PART IN MAY.  ITS NOW NOVEMBER!!!! I CALL, THEY SAY IT'S COMING,  I GET POST CARDS IN THE MAIL SAYING IT'S COMING.&#60;br /&#62;
WHERE THE HECK IS IT COMING FROM?????&#60;br /&#62;
I AM SO FRUSTRATED.  IT'S KILLING ME, BUT I HAVE TO NOW GO OUT AND BUY A NEW VACUUM.

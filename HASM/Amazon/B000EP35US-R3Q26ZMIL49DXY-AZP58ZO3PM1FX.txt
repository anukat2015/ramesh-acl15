Title: VERY PLEASED WITH THIS ORDER
Content:
I ORDERED THIS IPOD AS A XMAS GIFT FOR MY 20 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER & SHE TOTALLY LOVES IT. SHE SCREAMED WITH DELIGHT WHEN SHE OPENED THIS GIFT,  - SHE SAID IT WAS VERY EASY TO OPERATE & FIGURE OUT - SHE'S ALREADY UPLOADED TONS OF MUSIC TO IT, SHE UPLOADED HUNDREDS OF SONGS IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, IT IS VERY FAST,  WE ARE TOTALLY HAPPY & EXCITED WITH THIS NEW APARATUS. IT HOLDS TONS OF MUSIC AS WELL AS VIDEOS & PICTURES SO SHE CAN SHOW HER FRIENDS SLIDESHOWS OF PICS SHES TAKEN FROM HER CAMERA.  SHE TOTALLY LOVES IT. IF YOU WANT TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PERSON WHO BUYS THE BEST GIFTS -  GET YOUR TEEN ONE OF THESE FOR A GIFT. THEYLL LOVE YOU FOREVER!  I SPENT OVER $1000 ON MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS & ID HAVE TO SAY THIS WAS ONE OF HER FAVORITE GIFTS. IT COMES IN ALL KINDS OF HOT BRIGHT COLORS OR IF THEYRE NOT INTO COLORS - THERES WHITE, BLACK, OR SILVER!  EXCELLENT CHOICE! I SHOP AROUND TOO & THIS WAS THE BEST DEAL I FOUND.

Title: Good product but too small - mine was defective- had to return it
Content:
Hi.. I bought the Black XT the first week it started selling at Amazon. I researched for several months on which D-SLR to buy, at first I read a lot about avoiding bulky and heavy d-SLRs. So I decided for the XT because it is a newer generation product, seemed small a very light.  The camera performed well but mine had a defective flash mechanism, I also noticed a soft focus problem (this has been mentioned in several forums). So I returned to amazon - they gave me a refund after 30 days and I decided not to buy the same product again. IT IS JUST TOO SMALL FOR MY HANDS, I couldnt get a good firm grip on it. So I went to a store and tried the Nikon d70...PERFECT Ergonomic design, so I bought it. 
Be careful, go to your local store and see if this camera feels good in your hands.. when buying a d-SLR, you will probably stick with the camera longer that a point-shoot camera, it is essential that you feel comfortable with it. I liked the d70 very much, also the quality of the Nikon kit lens is much more better than the canon kit lens, take that into consideration seriously, just do a search on google for the price of the Nikon 18-70mm lens v.s. the price for the Canon 18-55mm lens.
When moving into SLR camera, in future years, you will probably stick with your lenses and just upgrade the body, lens technology does not change as camera bodies do. Battery life is also better on the d70. The XT is still a great camera and a good buy. d70 has a better body finish. So go to you local camera store and take a couple of sample shots with the different D-SLRs available before buying online.

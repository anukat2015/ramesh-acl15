Title: "rattle" is probably not a flaw
Content:
Regarding the highlighted review by L. Wimberley:  The Digital Rebel XT is equipped to detect whether you're shooting horizontally or vertically.  To do so, there may be a free-hanging piece within the camera to detect which way is up as you hold the camera.  This may be what's making the rattling sound.
The sensor is handy, as the camera uses this data to auto-rotate images in the viewfinder for you when they were shot vertically.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
We drink a lot of coffee.  I decided it was time to get the best coffee maker that I could (excluding those in the $1000 and up range).  I researched, read reviews and researched some more.  I finally ordered the Capresso MT500.  It is certainly a quality machine and it is easy to use.  It is attractive and doesn't hold on to fingerprints all over the carafe as I was afraid it would.  My problem with it is lukewarm coffee after an hour.  I get up an hour after my husband and by the time I add cream to my coffee, it is lukewarm at best.  When I make the evening pot, it is lukewarm for him (after an hour)even though he does not add cream.  The coffee is hot if you use it immediately but does not seem to hold the heat worth a darn. I find this at odds with other reviewers which perplexes me.  I don't even like my coffee really hot and frequently had to let it cool down before drinking it with my Mr. Coffee.  I am very surprised that this is an issue for me but I am telling you, lukewarm coffee is not acceptable...especially after paying this much.I also found that the stop and brew is difficult to use when you have to unscrew the lid to the black dot, pour your coffee and rescrew it before returning it to the coffeemaker.  It has started dripping again on more than one occasion.  Mine is going back today.

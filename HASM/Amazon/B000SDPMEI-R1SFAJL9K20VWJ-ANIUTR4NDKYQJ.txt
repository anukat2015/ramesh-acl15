Title: Comments about a Nikon D-40 with 2 lenses.
Content:
The camera was very satisfactory on first examination and use. It met the product descriptions. The two lenses spanned the range 18-200mm and should both be useful but were not very fast insofar as f ratings. I may have more comments on further use.

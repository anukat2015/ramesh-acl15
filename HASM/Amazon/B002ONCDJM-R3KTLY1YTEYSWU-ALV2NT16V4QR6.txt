Title: Good laptop at a great price
Content:
Got this from Amazon before Christmas for $[...] (aft[...]).  Nice sturdy laptop, very well built.  The power switch works kind of funky (have to press it real hard from the right side of the button), but not worth returning for refund or repair as the laptop typically is just closed and opened (sleep mode).  Won't ding this on the ratings since on balance this laptop is great in so many other respects like...Win7 runs without problems that plagued Vista.  Screen on the laptop is absolutely gorgeous.  Keyboard and touchpad are excellent.  Hard drive is quiet and fast.  Typical HP crap-ware was easy to uninstall and remove.  In summary, great laptop at a decent price.  Edit: Kudos to HP - Rebate received in one month!

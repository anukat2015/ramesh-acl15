Title: small heater
Content:
I work night shift and the area is work at gets quite chilly at night. one of my co-workers had this heater and let me borrow it. I was so impressed on how well it worked and warmed up the area I work in that I came home and got on-line and ordered one. One of my other co-workers were so impressed with it that she ordered one also.  This heater needs no start up time to start producing warm air. I love the feature that if it tips over or it something gets in the the way of the air flow that it automatically shuts off. This heater is a great deal for the price. I am going to order another one for my daughters dorm room.

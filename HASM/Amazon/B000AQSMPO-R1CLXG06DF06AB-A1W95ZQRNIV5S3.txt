Title: Best Birthday Present Ever!
Content:
After doing extensive research my husband gave me the B60 for my birthday this year and I have to say that it is one of the best gifts I've ever received!  As a new mom that has returned to work everything is about convenience and the lack of preparation or cleanup that's associated with the B60 is perfect.  It provides a great-tasting, steaming hot cup of coffee or tea in about a minute and I love having the variety of pods to choose from every time I make a cup.  During a recent visit my in-laws tried our Keuring and loved it so much they purchased their own when they returned home.  We recommend this to everyone :-)

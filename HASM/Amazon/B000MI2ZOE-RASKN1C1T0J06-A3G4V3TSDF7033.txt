Title: decent portable AC unit
Content:
I would only buy this over a window AC unit if you value the portability. It is quite heavy, but is on wheels so it is portable. AC unit cools well. Window insert is poorly designed, so you need to use putty or something else to modify the fit in the window sill to prevent the flow of warm outdoor air into the room.

Title: DO NOT BUY,   Piece of junk
Content:
Vacuum cleaner looks cool, that's the only thing it's good for.  Purchased vacuum cleaner a month ago and still have yet to be able to use it.    The vacuum cleaner has a defective connector assembly for the power nozzle. You slide the wand into the power nozzle until it clicks.  Now you pull the wand back toward you and the power nozzle falls off.  Being an engineer it looks like a design flaw or they gave me the wrong disconnect pedal or wand. The pin is just too small to hold the power nozzle on.  I called Hoover and explained that the connector hole is too big or the wand pin is too small.  Hoover would not replace the wand but would send me a new connector.  Two weeks later I received the connector with the same size connector hole.  which means the pin is too small.  Spent an hour on the phone again trying to get a new wand.  Again they would not send me a wand for their defective junk unless I send them $50 for the wand.  Month later I still cannot use the vacuum.  Next step returning to Amazon.  I would avoid this vacuum cleaner, it's useless.   Not sure how you other reviewers got this vacuum to work, guess you all got the right parts.

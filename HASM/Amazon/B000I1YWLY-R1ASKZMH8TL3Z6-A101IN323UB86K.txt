Title: Look elsewhere for a vacuum
Content:
The Electrolux EL 7055A Twin Clean Bagless Canister is by far the worst vacuum I've ever owned.  The suction on this model is pitiful.  I have a 13 years old Kenmore canister that is much better.  I purchased in July '07. I complained to Electrolux and Amazon and they said to have the vacuum looked at by an authorized dealer.  I did so and the service dealer said the vacuum is working as designed (what a marvelous design).  Last week the vacuum died completely.   So it's again back at the authorized dealer. The Electrolux service department was no help.  Unfortunately, I did not act within the 60 day return window and Amazon was no help either.  I spent $350 dollars on a piece of junk.  Stay away.....far away!!!

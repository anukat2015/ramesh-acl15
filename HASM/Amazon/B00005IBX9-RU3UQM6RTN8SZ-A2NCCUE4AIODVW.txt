Title: What are you complaining about?
Content:
This coffeemaker rocks. I used to brew coffee using an old stove top percolator (20 minutes) which is the best tasting coffee but a bigger pain to clean. So this is a strong second. This is more convenient Monday thru Friday (for us working stiffs) and is a pretty good cup of coffee in 7 minutes! So if you don't have the time to wait for a stove top percolator than this is hands down your best choice.

Title: Yep! It LEAKS everywhere
Content:
It's a great coffeemaker with a leaking problem.  As everyone here says, it leaks, and it leaks EVERYWHERE.  Easily a quarter cup of water every morning.  And, I'd say that since everyone is having the problem, it's a product design flaw.  It's a shame, too, because this really is a nice coffee maker, otherwise.
I'm pretty sure the leak is due to the removable water chamber.  At the bottom of the chamber, there's a spring loaded valve that is supposed to keep the water in the tank while you load the water tank at your sink and carry it back to the machine.
However, once you stick it in the machine, it's a bit too rigid, and it doesn't fully seat itself on the water supply tube that the coffee maker uses.
Right below the water tank/water line assembly is a little channel for water to collect in, and at the bottom of that channel is a drip hole.   The drip hole is working fine... it's the outlet for all the water!
And yes, Delonghi's customer service stinks, especially when the product is clearly flawed.
If it weren't for the leaks, I'd easily have rated this at least 4 stars.
Very, very disappointing.

Title: Fantastic DSLR!!
Content:
I bought this camera for my wife and she loves it.  The camera has worked flawlessly, and takes amazing pictures.  It was easy for her to figure out the basic features very quickly and she was taking fantastic pictures of our kids in minutes.  I bought an 8 gb mem card with it thinking that she'd need a huge card since it has 12MP - she usually only uses about 2-3 gigs between downloads (500+ pics).  Great starter camera, great price.  Now to find a great deal on a zoom lens...

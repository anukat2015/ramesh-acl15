Title: A MUST HAVE
Content:
After reading other positive reviews I decided to buy. Everything you've read is true. This thing sounds amazing. It is hands down the best sounding MP3 player I've owned (Archos, IPOD, Mobiblu, & Zune). I listen to it through a pair of Shure SE530's. While it may seem crazy to drive $500 headphones with an $80 player, let me tell you it is justified. Buy one you'll love it.

Title: Great Heater for the Price!!!
Content:
This heater exceeded our expectations!  The unit is a little noisy, but it doesn't bother us, and my wife is a lite sleeper.  I'm in the process of buying a 2nd unit.  Couldn't be happier for the price!  Highly recommend.  FYI, Consumer Reports rated this highly.

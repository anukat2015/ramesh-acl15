Title: Simple, solid player
Content:
This is the second Sansa of this type that I've bought (first one's for my wife), and it works well. One thing to know when loading music to it: Don't load more than 10 songs at a time, or it won't load them right, and you'll end up with what sounds like a scratched CD. That said, if you drag 10 songs to it, then another 10, and so on, you're in good shape. Kind of a bummer, but that's what I've found. Once the songs are on it, it's great.

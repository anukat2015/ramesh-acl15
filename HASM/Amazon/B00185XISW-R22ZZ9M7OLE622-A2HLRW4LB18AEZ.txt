Title: caveat
Content:
It was love at first sight, A great looking heater, producing oodles of heat - even in upstate New York, and using 1/3 of the wattage of my baseboard heaters - what's not to love? I picked up six of them and mounted them on various walls around the house.
The honeymoon ended after 18 months. The heater in my bedroom started singing a tuneful but dolorous melody whenever it turned on. A few weeks of that and it sang no more. Curious, I removed it from its wall mounting and discovered large, deep cracks on the surface of its backside. Even more curious, I started removing some of the other heaters. Though only three had scary cracks, all showed some signs of cracking. It did not seem to matter whether they had been mounted on interior or exterior walls. They cracked. I wish the manufacturer had gone to Corning for the ceramic!
Fire hazard, I said to myself.
Divorce was inevitable.

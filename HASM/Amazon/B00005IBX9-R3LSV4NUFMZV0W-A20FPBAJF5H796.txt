Title: Excellent!
Content:
I bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee machine that died. My daughter has a Cuisinart and I always thought it made good coffee, though hers grinds beans etc and is a pain to clean. So I bought this simpler one. It makes excellent coffee, and the coffee is very hot, way hotter than my old machine. I appreciate not having to warm the cups first. It keeps the coffee hot for a long time without giving it that nasty cooked taste. The clock window is not lit, which is also a plus. In the summer, the light in my old one would attract bugs at night. All in all, I would highly recommend this.

Title: good
Content:
generally a good device, though I find the scroller a little obnoxious on this device, as there is no effective way to scroll through a lot of albums (where as other players have an option for scrolling through the alphabet as opposed to going through each album).
Also very annoying is that I can't find a way to make the titles of songs that are too long to fit unto the screen to scroll through the title, as you can with other players. 
Lastly it is a little annoying that I cannot use windows media player to upload music unto the device, but rather have to use a special "Zune" program. It isn't a huge deal as it downloads all my music to the program anyways, but I've gotten used to using Windows Media player, and you would think the device being made by Microsoft and all you'd be able to us Windows Media Player.
It is a good device though, looks nice, is small, holds as much music as I would ever need, and is relatively easy to find your way around the device and program.

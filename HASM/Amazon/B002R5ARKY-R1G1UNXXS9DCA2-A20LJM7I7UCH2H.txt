Title: Replaced a Dell with ths computer
Content:
I replace a Dell laptop and I am very happy with this computer, lot of computing power, much faster booting up and returning form the sleep mode. The only thing I am a little concerned is that the wifi disconectes form the the router but hooks up very quickly on it's own, I like the way it does up dates and I got one late last week about Internet connections and I think the problem maybe has gotten better.
Over all it is a great computer and windows 7 is working good for me, I changed from XP,  missed visa and have had no problems. I see the price has gone uo $200, maybe this is an indication it is good computer and is in demand.

Title: Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1 Camera
Content:
This is an expensive 35 mm camera equipped with a functionally useless LCD view screen.  The LCD view screen is turned off by a contact swich as one uses the eye piece to focus and take picture -- an awkard arrangement. One should not be confused by the advert which gives the illusion that the image in the view screen is live; it is not.  In fact, the view screen is use to review a picture after it has been taken and to display the elaborate camera settings.  The camera is very difficult to configure and use.  This is the most useless camera that I have seen.
I give it half a star or less.

Title: Good Heater - in the right application
Content:
The biggest thing to consider when buying this heater is how you will use it.  It is a good heater for direct heating - it will heat whatever is in front of it up to about 10 feet away.  It will not heat the air in the room.  If you're sitting on the sofa with it pointed at you, it's fine.  I've also used it in the bathroom sitting on the counter so that coming out of the shower was warmer.  But if you expect to turn it on a couple hours before bed and have a nice cozy bedroom, this is not the heater for you.  The 2 power settings (400W & 800W) help to keep the electricity cost down.  Overall it's a good heater, you just have to use it for what it's designed for.

Title: Shin-warmer
Content:
This heater really should be adjustable because if it's on the floor all it will heat is your shins. It also has to be about 1 ft away on low for you to feel anything and about 3 ft away on high. I like radiant heaters because they're quiet and they don't waste energy heating the air but I wish I had looked elsewhere and got a tower instead of this one.

Title: Great travel companion
Content:
The Msi X340 is a very very light weight machine. It's true that the keyboard and palm rest is a bit flimsy but overall the machine is incredible. The processor is fast enough to handle your basic everyday needs. If you need this to do Word, browse websites, and listen to music then it's perfect for you. Vista starts up quickly and everything is very snappy during normal use. The power adapter is also very small. The included mouse (X340) is great.

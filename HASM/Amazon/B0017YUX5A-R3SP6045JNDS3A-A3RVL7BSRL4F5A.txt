Title: Good Features poor Implementation
Content:
This vacuum is nice and solid and a fairly good cost to benefit item.  However, The hose is about a foot too short and very stiff to maneuver, even for someone only 5'4".  The motor seems to give off a very high pitched whine which is quite annoying after a few minutes; it's loud, too.  The beater bar attachment does NOT auto level to flooring types and heights; thus when on a carpet it takes on a life of its own and is hard to direct.  The bare floor attachment is very nice... wide and has rollers for ease of use.  Again it's nice and most attachments are carried on-board, but it is difficult to maneuver and noisy.  I didn't keep it.
The Amazon ordering process was very simple and the delivery extremely prompt.

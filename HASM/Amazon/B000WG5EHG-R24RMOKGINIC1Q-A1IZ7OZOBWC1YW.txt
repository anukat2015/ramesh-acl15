Title: Fantastic, Easy to use MP3 Player!
Content:
This MP3 player was very easy to set up and use. I bought some music from the Zune marketplace that I didn't own, and uploaded a lot of my own music from my vast CD collection. I had no problems at all with the software-I run Windows Vista, and it was a snap-very easy, simple and fast. The sound quality is excellent, and the video quality is outstanding. The price is right compared to the Apple IPod, which I think is very overpriced. I'm glad to see someone competing with Apple and doing an excellent job of it. The only thing I did not like is the standard earplugs that come with this-they are very uncomfortable! I purchased thru Amazon the JVC marshmallow set and they are so, SO much more comfortable and keep the sound quality. 
The mistake I made was getting the 4GB. I should have gone for the bigger 
GB, even though I have about 160 songs saved in 3 different playlist headings. For next Christmas on my wish list I will ask for a larger Zune 2nd generation MP3 media player. Zune is definately the way to go!!

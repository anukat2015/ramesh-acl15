Title: A Must
Content:
Before purchasing the new Microsoft Zune 80 gig, I was very skeptical. For me, I had to decide between: Apple's Ipod, Creative Zen, or Microsoft's Zune. I've lived with Apple my whole life. All of my computers have been Apple as well as my mp3 players. I decided on a Zune after seeing my friend have one. Best decision I have made. Superb player against the Ipod. Watch out Apple.

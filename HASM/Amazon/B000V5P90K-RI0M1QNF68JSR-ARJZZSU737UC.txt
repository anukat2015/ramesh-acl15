Title: Outstanding Camera
Content:
I bought the kit. Camera and Lens, and I am glad I did. The value added by the lens is great. The lens has a great range from 28-135mm and I have it on the camera all the time. It is well suited for most situations you will come across in everyday shooting. It has reduced the amount of lens changing I have done in the past. The camera is well constructed and feels like a piece of professional equipment in your hands. The controls are clear and well placed. The only control I wish that had been done differently is the Power switch, but after a little time with the camera I have gotten used to it. The camera takes great pictures and is very fast. I love the way the camera is almost instantly ready as soon as you turn it on. I have not been able to notice any lag or delay between shots. 
  The 40D has many automatic modes that will take a great picture for you. There are also creative and a manual mode  for the more advanced people that buy this camera. As well as three presets that you can program manually to suit your common picture taking needs. The battery has a very long life span. You can take hundreds of pictures on a single charge. Having a spare battery with you is always a good idea and worth the price. 
    If you're considering purchasing this camera you can't go wrong with this camera. I give it a big thumbs up. The only consideration you might have at this point is to perhaps go to the 50D which just came out to market.

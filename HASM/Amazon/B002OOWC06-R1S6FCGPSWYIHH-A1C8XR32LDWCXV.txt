Title: Very nice small laptop
Content:
I read all the reviews up through early March (then I bought the laptop) and I can now add the following:
The sound is great compared to my other small laptop - you do need to go in and turn up the equalizer in the smart sound settings to get full volume though.
The touchpad works fine - no issues.  Some people may not have been used to the two finger zoom, and scrolling features...
Battery life is awesome and the screen is beautiful.
The speed is great and everything works fine for the most part.  The only two things I have an issue with are:
1. Occasionally, the wireless seems to lose connection very briefly when I first navigate to a page - and when I refresh the browser it works fine... Could be the browser or my home network.  In any case only a minor nuisance and probably not a hardware problem in the laptop.
2. The screen angle does not tilt back as far as I would like for when I am standing and looking at it on the kitchen counter - needed another inch back or so.  Again a very  minor nuicance.
Overall I would recommend this laptop, best one I have ever had.

Title: Fantastic and easy to use
Content:
I have been using the a300 for about and a month and I love it.  These are the best pictures I've ever taken.  I am still learning to take advantage of all the dslr goodies, but it is simple to take professional looking shots right out of the box with auto settings.  The articulating live-view and auto-focus are nearly perfect.
My dslr research led me to Sony and I am very glad it did.  Amazon (and Electronics Expo) gave me a great deal and fast delivery.  Great camera!

Title: I thought Cuisinart was supposed to be better than this
Content:
Worst.  Coffee.  Pot.  Ever.  
The perfect pot for those who love lukewarm coffee with an ashtray taste.  You should also acquire a taste for grinds if you want to brew over 6 or 7 cups.  What a mess!  BLAH!  We took it back and will return to our glorious percolator ways.  I will miss the programmable feature, but everything from the lukewarm coffee (should I really have to microwave my coffee just after I pour it?!?!?), grind issue (should I really have to pass the coffee through a sieve before drinking?!?!?), slow pouring & faulty brew pause features will surely not be missed.

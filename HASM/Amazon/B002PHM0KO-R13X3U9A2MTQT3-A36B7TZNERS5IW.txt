Title: Relieved at a great computer
Content:
The best thing about this laptop is that it "feels like a good computer."  Nowadays the guts of a computer are standard enough, so it is the aesthetics now that differentiate.
The body is "textured", so fingerprints and smudges don't show up; it still looks like new.  There is no "ten key" keypad on the keyboard, which means that the keys are spaced with just a bit more room to make typing more comfortable.  The keys themselves have a solid feel, and no rattle or wiggle.  The touchpad is also texturized, not too glassy.
The screen is bright and crisp, a joy for watching movies.  The "one touch web access without booting up" feature is nice, so it can act like my iphone I suppose -- easy to quickly check email without having to power it all up.  
I've used it while plugged in and on battery power, and it stays cool enough to rest on my bare legs.  
The extra junk software about which others complain -- just wipe out and reinstall the operating system before using it; the free stuff won't re-appear.
PROS:
Textured body, solid keyboard, crisp screen.  Good overall tactile "feel."
CONS:
A bit heavier than others.
Overall, its a good product.  It is my second VAIO, my work laptop is a Dell, and I've had WINBOOK and HP in the past too.  So far, SONY appears to consistenly make a good product that stands up to wear and tear.  I would recommend this laptop to friends!!

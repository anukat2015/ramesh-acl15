Title: No thanks amazon
Content:
I purchased this laptop because it was lighter than my old Acer and was supposed to have an 8 hour battery life. When fully charged it shows 3 hours and 51 minutes of battery life. It also locked up (crashed) twice making the restore disks. I went to the Amazon site to see about a return and they want to charge me 15% penalty to return it. Why should I pay 15% to return a laptop that is not what it is advertised as. Less than 1/2 the battery life they are advertising. 
Update: Amazon has agreed to refund in full since the laptop is defective.

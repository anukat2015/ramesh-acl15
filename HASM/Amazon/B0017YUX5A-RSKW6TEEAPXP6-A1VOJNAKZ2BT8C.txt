Title: Just barely ok
Content:
I carefully selected the Hoover Windtunnel canister because  I have bare floors and wanted the power head AND the floor brush.  In my opinion, you need both for hard floors because the power head is too big to get into some of the small spaces.
The vacuum does a good job of vacuuming, but the hose is sooooo inflexible, that I am constantly fighting it to twist the tools into the small spaces.  I have typically used the dusting brush for alot of dusting.  The inflexibility of the hose along with the huge grip makes it hard to use it for dusting dressers, small objects, and base boards.  In addition, the hose will fold, which stops the air flow.
Almost immediately after I got it a part fell off that protects the electrical connection on the handle.  The part is now broken.  Since that part is not there, the electrical connections keep working loose so the power head quits working. I think this could be a safety issue.
It is a product with great features, but some design problems that could have been discovered if they had done usability testing.  
I dont recommend the Hoover Windtunnel.

Title: Pros outweigh the cons
Content:
Lets just get to the point
Pros:
-Sleek design is perfect for working out with
-Lots of colors to choose from
-Screen resolution is nice with crisp images
-Sound quality is flawless
-Most cost effective iPod
-Accelerometer offers a fun change for games and other features like shuffling, it can also be turned off so it doesn't shuffle songs every time you drop it into your pocket.
-Very easy menu navigation
-Almost never freezes for it uses flash memory, not a hard-drive
Cons:
-Battery life is somewhat lacking, not terrible, but the classic is better battery-wise
-Won't work with older accessories
If your looking for a good solid iPod and don't want to spend a crap-load of money, this is the iPod to get.  Overall I highly recommend it, besides, it looks wicked awesome.

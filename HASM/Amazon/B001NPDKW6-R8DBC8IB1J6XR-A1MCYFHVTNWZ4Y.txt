Title: Awesome laptop
Content:
I read tons of reviews for laptops.  I spent a couple weeks doing research.  Over and over I kept coming back to this one.  It has been a month since it arrived on my doorstep and it has been wonderful.  Set up was a breeze.  There have been no issues with vista or connecting to other devices.
Speed and memory are great.  I'm very pleased with the purchase and consider it well worth the money.
I downloaded Microsoft 2007 and the entire Adobe Web Premium program.  I deal primarily with photos and videos.  Nothing slows it down.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
We normally use a very basic, non-programmable coffee maker. When our current one bought the farm, we intended to replace it with the exact same model. Right beside it was this Procter-Silex model for almost 10 bucks less so we decided to give it a try. Not a good decision. The brew selector dial did little if anything to change the strength of coffee. The scoop provided was a bit bigger than our previous one but the instructions said to use one per cup whereas with our previous model we used one scoop for two cups. Any money we saved on this coffee maker would have been lost in the fact that this unit needs twice as many coffee grounds to brew the same amount of coffee. We took it back to exchange for the Black and Decker model with which we've had good luck in the past.

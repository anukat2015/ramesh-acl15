Title: Cool idea, but hard to use
Content:
The Swissbeat is a clever idea, combining a few useful tools with data storage and MP3 capability. The ability to separate the player from the tool holder is great for travel. However, the menus and single-button control are frustrating to say the least, especially for programming the FM radio. The FM is mono only, I've never been able to receive in stereo, even when signal strength is optimum.

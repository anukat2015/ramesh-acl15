Title: Best ipod!
Content:
I was considering buying an ipod touch but decided instead for more memory over the cool features of the touch. I have not been disappointed yet! This is a great ipod and I almost never leave the house without it! It holds SO many songs, games, pictures and movies! The price is totally reasonable and the ipod is fantastic!

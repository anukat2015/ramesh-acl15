Title: I LOVE this thing!
Content:
I got my green mini through cingular rewards.  I work for Cingular and get points for sales, etc.  The mini was 9,196 points.  Well worth it.  Some people have said their's locked up on them.  Mine has been great.  It's one of the few things i've gotten in recent years that wasn't made shoddy and just a piece of junk.  The finish looks really nice, the belt clip holds it very sturdy, it's so easy to use, and it sounds great.  I've bought a couple different headsets for them and found the sony pair the best (I have no idea what model they are.  They just sound great.)  I've put 716 songs on it so far (about 60 cds) and sometimes wish I had more room.  I have over 2000 cds.  But then i'd just be loading it up and not listening to most of the stuff on it.  With only 4 gigs of space, it gives me plenty of music but makes me erase some stuff every now and then to put something new on it.  It's not annoying in the least simply cuz I love to play with the thing.  
Some advice for anyone just getting the mini:  If you start to import a cd, sometimes you'll get a very irritating click at the beginning of track one.  I've noticed if you just play the cd for about 2 seconds BEFORE you import a song, it won't put the click.  I'm guessing it's because the disk is already spinning at full speed when you begin importing, rather than it having to spin it and then begin.  It's worked perfectly for me so far.
Anyway, I love this thing and constantly recommend it to all my friends. I'm definately getting another one (pink) for my fiance.

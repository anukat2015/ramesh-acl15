Title: Makes Great Coffee
Content:
In the past we used the Cuisinart DGB-300, the model DGB-600 has several product improvements. Like beefier grinder bowl and plastic lid and thermal pot. The new model shuts off after brewing and coffee is held in sealed thermal pot, note the coffee is never heated once brewed, also the thermal pot retains heat longer if pre-heated with hot water. The top lid latch is a little flimsy and difficult to latch, as is the drawer which holds the grinder basket, it must be pushed in several times to get latched. Cleaning, after grinding the beans, coffee powder and grindings leak out and are difficult to keep clean between uses. The DGB-600 makes great tasting coffee but is more labor intensive than our earlier model.

Title: Almost perfect.
Content:
This coffee maker is excellent.  It makes great tasting coffee quickly, and keeps it hot for hours.  I usually fire it up around 8:15A and it is still warm enough for an afternoon cup at 3:30P.  It will not overflow if the carafe is not seated precisely in the right position, as happened frequently with my last coffee maker.  The sneak-a-cup feature works fine, but usually drips one drop each time i use it.  Its only cumbersome feature is the cap on the carafe.  I find it difficult to grasp and turn.  May not be the best choice for someone with weak hands.  That being said, this coffee maker is a good value and I would recommend it to others.

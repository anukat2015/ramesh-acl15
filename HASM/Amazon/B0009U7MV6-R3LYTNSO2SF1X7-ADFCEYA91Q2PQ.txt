Title: Old Pentax lenses can be used with this camera
Content:
I made the decision a few months ago that the time was right to buy a digital SLR.  I considered a number of models.  What sold me on this one was that I am able to use my very old, but very good, lenses. [...]  
I had 4 Pentax ME Super bodies from the 1980's.  My lenses also date from that time.
The manual was not very helpful in figuring this out.  It does require a setting change and one can shoot in only manual focus mode with aperture priority.  It's very much like shooting with the old ME's but with a 6.3 megapixel digital image as the result.  
From the menu, go to "Custom Setting," scroll down to "Using aperture ring," set to "Permitted."

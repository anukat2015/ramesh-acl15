Title: Old Krups was much better
Content:
I had to replace my old Krups coffee maker and this one is useless! Extremely difficult to program, and every time we lose power, it brings back an annoying beep when the coffee is ready. It has drip interrupt so who cares when the whole pot is ready? Constantly instructs you to "decalcify" - who has time for that?

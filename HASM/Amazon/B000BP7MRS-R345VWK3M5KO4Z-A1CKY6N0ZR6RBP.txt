Title: Thank you Lord!
Content:
Finally a coffee maker for the home with an adjustable automatic shut off! I have been searching for a reasonably priced home coffee maker that didn't shut off automatically after 2 hours! It seems as if companies were on this 2 hour auto shut off kick but we are all on different schedules in my house and that was not working out. Who knew the shut off timer would be so crucial for a happy morning? Oh and the coffee is good to the last drop of course!

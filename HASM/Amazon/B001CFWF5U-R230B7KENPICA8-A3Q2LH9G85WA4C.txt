Title: So far, so good.
Content:
We have only used it once so far, but it (and the heater) worked perfectly.  My family of four spent two nights in our tent with nighttime temperatures dipping into the low 40s.  Each night, we would turn the heater on high for about an hour before we put the kids to bed.  Then, we'd leave it on low until morning.  The 10'x14' tent remained quite comfortable all night long.  In two nights, we used approximately 1/2 of the propane in the 20lb. bottle (which was full when we started).  As such, there was no need to change out propane bottles during the trip.  Very convenient -- and much more cost effective than using the individual 1-lb. bottles.
We used a battery-powered carbon-monoxide detector so that we could feel more comfortable letting the heater run all night.  The alarm never went off, and we experienced no problems.  This makes me feel much better about using this heater in a tent in the future.  Even so, I will always use it only with the CO detector.

Title: does the job...
Content:
got this little heater as auxillary warm up for my little girls room, which tends to be the coolest in the house...small footprint, and does the job in a 12x14 room with wooden floors...you can set up different levels of heat between the two knobs, to keep the room just right, and the unit never gets too hot to touch...in fact, on full blast, the room would be stuffy...not too loud, either. For the money, cant be beat!

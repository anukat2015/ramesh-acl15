Title: Finally a Great Vacuum
Content:
I have been wanting a good canister vacuum that is quiet.  Consumer Digest had great notes on this specific Hoover (S3765-040)Wind Tunnel Canister Vacuum.  I loved the price and quick shipment from Amazon.  We love our new vacuum, and so does the dog.  It doesn't make that loud noise like other vacuums, but it really picks up dirt from our tile and area rugs.

Title: No! Save yourself!
Content:
I received this coffeemaker as a gift about 18 months ago. It was a major pain to tear down and clean out every day...but I figured, hey, that's the price you pay for something so cool. After about a year it started to become more difficult to remove the grinder (which is necessary for cleaning both grinder and the little chute the ground coffee travels down). Now, as others have reported, it's irretrievably stuck. Out came the trusty old Braun grinder, and I'm back to grinding beans the night before and using the coffeemaker without the grinder. E-mailed Cuisinart and...not a word in reply. This is distressing as I own quite a lot of their stuff but will hesitate to buy more. 
Up side: This is the first unit I've had with a thermal carafe, and I'll never go back to glass. Especially if you preheat the carafe, coffee stays hot for ages, and hooray for no more skunky burned stuff, plus less worries about fire hazard. 
So, Capresso, here I come! I've looked longingly at their unit with a built-in burr grinder, but after reading those reviews I've decided that it's better to keep the two tasks in separate units. Although I may lose out on some coffee-snob bragging rights by grinding the night before, in truth I can't taste much difference, if any.

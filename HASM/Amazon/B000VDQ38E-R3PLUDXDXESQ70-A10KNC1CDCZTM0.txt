Title: Need new carpet?  Not anymore!
Content:
So, I thought i would need new carpet.  I had been using an older machine that just didn't have any suction anymore.  I thought I was cleaning the carpet, but it still looked old and dirty.  I decided enough was enough and ordered my new Bissell 3920 Pet Hair Eraser on a Saturday.  I tossed the old vacuum in the trash on Tuesday and received my new one on Tuesday night!  And that was with super saver shipping!
So, to make a long story short, one good sweep and I don't need new carpet anymore. I have never seen this carpet this clean before.  I completely filled the collecting bin in just one use, so it had obviously been a while since anything cleaned this well.
For any pet owners, I highly recommend this unit. It is amazing.

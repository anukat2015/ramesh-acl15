Title: Quiet, warm, simple...
Content:
After reading the reviews of this heater on amazon, I decided to go ahead and purchase one of these heaters for my upstairs bedroom.  My house is old and drafty, and during the winter I can never seem to make my bedroom warm enough.My heater arrived on the night of a big Noreaster, and I took it upstairs and plugged it in.  Within minutes I could feel the toasty difference.  It made the room tempeture rise by 10 degrees, easily.  I went from 62, to a nice pleasant 72.  My husband likes it because it keeps the air nicely circulated.  He likes a fan going year round, and this satifies me because it only blows warm air.  We both love it.I don't understand the negative reviews regarding this product.  I've not had any of those problems.  I just plugged the heater in and it worked as promised.  It's the best space heater I've owned.

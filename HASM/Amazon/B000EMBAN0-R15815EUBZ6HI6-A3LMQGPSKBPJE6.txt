Title: Not worth the bother...
Content:
Like other reviewers, I chose this vacuum because I really wanted a Dyson and couldn't afford it.  This seemed to have the same types of features I was looking for, but without being so overpriced.  It worked well on my carpet in the beginning, looked sharp, was pretty well contained, flush with accessories, and had a nice long cord.  Then it sucked up a string, and the rest was history.   
This vacuum is constantly getting clogged by just about everything. 
Sometimes it sucks up things that I don't intend for it to be near, which goes to show it has great suction when it's working properly, but I have had to put my fingers, elbows, spaghetti fork, wooden spoons, and just about any small handled object I can find into getting the spinning cyclones unclogged.  The filter is a pain to clean and has to be dry before it can be put back together.  Then, the plastic accessory holders started breaking, so now I have a crappy vacuum, with jagged pieces hanging off it, that won't suck, sitting in my living room.  I wish I could replace it right now, but I think I'll keep saving up and just get the Dyson...I expect to get more than 2 years out of a $200 vacuum.

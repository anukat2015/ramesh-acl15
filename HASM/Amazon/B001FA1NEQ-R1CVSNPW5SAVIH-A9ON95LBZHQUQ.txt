Title: Earphones suck
Content:
The Ipod itself is fantastic.  However,  I can't believe  Apple puts out a product which has such crappy headphones. They will not stay in your ears ... so I have to buy headphones from a third party and incur an additional expense. Apple Marketing Executives should have to sleep with their crappy headphones for 4 years ... or until their ears fester and fall off.
over and out

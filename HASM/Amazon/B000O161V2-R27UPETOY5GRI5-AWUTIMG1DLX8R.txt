Title: great camera
Content:
This camera is great for amateur photographers.  Easy to use right out of the box.  Many self-explanatory functions and easy to use menu.  Really good pictures with automatic setting.  Awesome resolution.  Great in-camera picture fixes like red-eye removal and crop.  Would recommend Nikon D40/D40X Field Guide rather than the user's manual.  Great battery time - about 400 pictures on one battery.  Highly recommended!

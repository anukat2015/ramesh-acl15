Title: Pretty but pretty useless.
Content:
I ordered this one due to Hoover name, good reviews, the fact that it works on wet, in addition to dry, messes, and because of of the attractive blue color.  I needed a hand vac for light pick up and specifically to remove the hard-to-reach dust and very fine wood particles left behind in new cabinets when hardware installed.  Unfortunately this unit is just too WEAK to effectively pick up even light particles.  After several passes, the dust was still there.  It also failed to pick up dust on speakers, chairs, and small threads dropped on carpet when sewing.  
I did try the "wet" feature by spilling approx. 1 tablespoon of water on the counter.  Most of it was picked up but the suction is so weak that there was still a very wet spot on the counter that had to be wiped up.  
As mentioned in other review, the filter really is a hassle to empty.  It's messy, gets lots of dust in the air (well, a good portion of the little dust it actually picks up, anyhow) and I found it necessary to use my fingers to remove some debris from filter (yuck!) before taking it apart and washing.  Air-drying takes several hours, so that's a pain, as well.
I REALLY wish that I'd somehow figured a way to charge the unit before trying it WITHOUT hanging the charging base on the wall.  I've returned it for a refund (I'll go for the less pretty, old-fashioned "dry" B&D next time) and now have two really ugly holes in the wall to remind me not to do that again:(.
Anyone ordering this should really consider charging and trying before hanging the unit.  I imagine it would be okay if all you ever needed was something to pick up spilled Cheerios, but for real "dust-busting" this one just isn't suitable.

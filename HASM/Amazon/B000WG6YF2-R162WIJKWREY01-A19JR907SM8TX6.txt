Title: Very impressed by Microsoft
Content:
I bought one two weeks ago and am really happy with it. It is very sturdy and built from high quality material. Browsing menus is much easier that iPods. Menu design is elegant and very intuitive. Headphones have very high quality, better than iPod headphones. Sound quality is excellent. The software that came with took a while to install, but works fine and is more intuitive than iTunes. Radio quality is very good. I have not yet used the wireless capability, but it is cool that you can "wirelessly" share music with people around you!

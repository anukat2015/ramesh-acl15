Title: Seems nice, but...
Content:
I searched a lot to come to this PC. It looks nice, full of features and in a acceptable for the features price. 
But...
It came without battery! I took it out of USA and then I found this problem. Amazon support was very nice, but the only thing tey were able to offer me in this situation was to refound me 200$. Thank you for this!Then - the only place this battery is available all over the Internet world is Sony Style - and they doesn't accept international credit cards...
At the end I got the battery, losing some money and time...
When I started the PC, I found:
The display is brilliant - amazing!
The PC is full with junk - and it's not easy to wipe it away...
Curently, I'm trying to make some order there.
Let's see...

Title: An effective heater
Content:
I use the Soleus heater in an office space where I keep the main thermostat set at 60 degrees. The Soleus is very effective in warming me as I work in this (otherwise) cool area. Even its lower setting keeps me warm, so I rarely use the high setting. I don't use the swing feature - when my side toward the heater is toasty, I turn it off. When I'm cold I turn it on. Because it's radiant heat, it only warms the side toward the heater. One glitch - the remote control that came with it didn't work, and I couldn't get a return call from Soleus customer service. But I wouldn't use the remote anyway, since the heater is only about 4 feet away. Others have said the light was too bright, but I don't find that to be the case. I have it positioned at my side and slightly behind, so I'm not looking at it. Make no mistake, it is bright - but not uncomfortably so if you position it right. I work at an LCD computer monitor all day and have found no problems with glare.

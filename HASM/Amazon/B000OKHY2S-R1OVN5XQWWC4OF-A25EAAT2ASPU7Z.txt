Title: Portable Evaporative Air Cooler
Content:
Possibly I got a bum product - but I was so disappointed with this purchase  - after setting it up. 
The product - unbeknownst to me - was badly cracked underneath by one of the wheels. It looked so beautiful when brought out of the box. I promptly filled it up with water and ice as mentioned in the directions. After a short time - I wound up seeing a flooded carpet. My neighbor's husband assisted placing it - very carefully - right side up into the tub to drain. Then he went to get the carpet shampooer to vacuum up all of the water. WHAT A MESS! Thankfully I have great neighbors and friends! 
The crack was huge - possibly it cracked with shipping - but I think it was packaged that way. Hard to tell. I packed it - once dried out - and shipped it back. I decided to buy a ceiling fan for the bedroom instead - and replace the AC in the living room - which - fortunately - cools the remaining rooms sufficiently.

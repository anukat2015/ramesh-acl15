Title: Best Little heater in Virginia.........................
Content:
I purchased one of these little beauties for a friend in Virginia, this is the only heat she has on. It keeps the house at 70 degrees even if it goes down to 29-30 outside. She just loves this stove and so do her cats. I think the previous person should read the instructions or check the connections because this heats about 400 square feet for her. She loves the fact that the heat comes out from the bottom, heats the whole room from the bottom up. I researched a lot of heaters and this one fits the bill wonderfully. Thank You DeLonghi............

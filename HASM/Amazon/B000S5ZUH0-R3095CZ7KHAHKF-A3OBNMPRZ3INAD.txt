Title: Great Product, awful service
Content:
The Archos 605 is a great product, with a clean, crisp 4.3 inch screen. However, after owning one myself, i returned it due to its compatibility issues, and the web browser. I advise against getting this product if you own a Mac, because the steps necessary to get the Archos up and running are extremely time consuming and pricey. Also, the web browser is extremely sluggish compared to Safari on the Ipod Touch. If you can deal with both of those issues, then you reach the customer service problems. To be able to call customer service, you have to set up an account for your Archos, which is a pain if you a Mac, because you cannot set up an account on Safari, it does not work. Customer service is the worst that you will ever deal with. I sat waiting for the operators to pick up the phone for over half an hour, and this happened multiple times. if you have the choice between the Archos and the Ipod Touch, go with the Touch. It is much more reliable, and easier to work with.

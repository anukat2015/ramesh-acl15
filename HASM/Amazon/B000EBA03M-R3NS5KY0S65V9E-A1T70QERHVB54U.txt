Title: There's better out there, and cheaper.
Content:
The E-500 is my first DSLR. I have owned it for about two years. Overall, the camera is not too bad for what it is, but you need deep pockets for any upgrades. Also, the kit lenses are soft (fuzzy). Later, you will find out that the "high grade" upgrade lens are soft, too. This camera is about the same level as the Canon Xti. If you have ever dreamt about learning professional photography, go with Canon or Nikon and forget about this camera.

Title: Powerful and Easy!
Content:
I recieved my Hoover about a month ago and so far love it. I really enjoy how I can use it on every surface even the couch. My roommate has a Oreck and one time after she has vacuumed I did later with mine, and the entire dust holder was full! My roommate has a cat and I am slightly allergic to it's fur, but I haven't had any issues since I got the Windtunnel. The only thing that I would consider a bad thing is it is kind of heavy (about 30 lbs).

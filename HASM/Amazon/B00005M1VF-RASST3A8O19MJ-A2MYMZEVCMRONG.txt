Title: Horrible Mess
Content:
I hated this coffee maker.  It made a mess every time I tried to use it--partly filling one cup and over filling the other.  I finally chucked it and bought 2 single cup makers from Black & Decker.  The only thing I saved from it was the actual travel mugs.  Don't buy this.

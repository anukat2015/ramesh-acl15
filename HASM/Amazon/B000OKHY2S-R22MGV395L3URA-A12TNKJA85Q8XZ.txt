Title: Good Buy
Content:
So this isn't as good as an air conditioner -- but is effective at cooling the air about 5-10 degrees depending... You can fill this with 6 liters of water, so logically, the more ice and chilled water, the cooler... We live in Seattle, and it's started to get warm in out apartment - this helps cool down the room -- and I'm writing this review minutes before I place an order for a second unit.  This was shipped quickly, with no defects, took only minutes to set up, and we're definitely happy.

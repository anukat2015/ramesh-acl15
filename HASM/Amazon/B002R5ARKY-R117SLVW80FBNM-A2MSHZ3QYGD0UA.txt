Title: Pray nothing goes wrong with your hp
Content:
1.  Bought extended warrranty for $300 and when something went wrong they claim you abused the laptop.  If you say you are being treated unfairly, they hang up on you.
2.  If you call back to talk to a manager, they say the don't have managers because they are all equals.
Bought a Sams club extended warranty and they were great.  Turn around was 3 days and the person you talked to spoke English as their first language!

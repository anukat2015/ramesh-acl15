Title: A beautiful, smooth working machine
Content:
First off, this product is *NOT* for carpet, as it does not have a powered head. 
But, since I have all hardwood and tile, it's just what we needed.
We live with two dogs and two long haired cats- plus, we've been doing some remodeling around our home so there is always hair and dirt to contend with. I'm mildly allergic to pet hair, but, in a place that's vacuumed frequently, haven't really had any problems.
The filter on this vacuum and the bags that go with it are super great about making sure that nothing you vacuum out gets back into the air. I'm even the type of person that vacuums with the same bag until its packed full- and even in removing the bag have never had any trouble with the nasty stuff getting back out. 
The swivel head on this model is perfect for vacuuming under our couch and kitchen cabinet ledges. I rarely have to go through the trouble of changing to a different nozzle to clean out the dirt that gets stuck in corners.
This machine also has some serious suction power. I underestimated it at first, until I accidently vacuumed up one of my husband's hiking socks and had to fish it out of the bag (oops!). It does come with several suction settings though, so the power is easily adjusted to get the most cleaning from the machine on whatever surface you need.
This model is super light- perfect for my since I have some trouble walking, and also feels very sturdy- again, perfect for me because I tend to treat things rough. 
I'm very happy with this vacuum.

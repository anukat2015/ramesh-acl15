I got this machine just before the holidays and it is just great. I've had a  Pentax MX and all my old lenses, extender and filters fit just fine. You just have to use it in manual or apperture priority mode. It got tested quite extensively during this new year's firework displays and returned stunning shots. Imagine seeing your shots right after you take them instead of hoping for the best with film slrs. The only problem is the long time it takes to load a night shot like the time exposure for the fireworks. I guess I lost roughly 30% of shots I would have taken with film. But over all it performs very well. Next on my wish list is a dedicated flash for this unit.

Title: The grand award for bad design
Content:
The grinder does not do a complete job. The steam from the coffeemaker comes up into the grinder, making a nasty mess each time you use it. The spring loaded basket unlatches on its own and allows coffee to dump everywhere.One of the worst appliances I've ever had. Back to my old Krups.

Title: Significant difference over the 30D
Content:
I initially started out with a Rebel XTi.  That was WAY too small and tiny....poorly constructed... not recommended for field use due to too much plastic.  Then I upgraded to the 30D (40D wasn't out yet).  The 30D was great...no complaints, really.  Once the 40D came out, I said "What the heck!"...traded up for the 40D.  That was a great decision and there's been no looking back.  The new features in the 40D are significantly noticeable.  The Auto ISO is really helpful in daytime shooting.
I do a lot of long exposure night photography and the 40D really excels here.  The 3 custom settings on the dial are heaven sent.  
My only complaint about the 40D is that you can no longer delete all pictures by clicking the "trash" button twice.  You have to go into the menu and reformat the card.  The trash button in playback mode only lets you delete an individual photo.  It's not that big of a deal, though.
If you're having any reservations about this camera....set them aside and get it... it's worth every penny.

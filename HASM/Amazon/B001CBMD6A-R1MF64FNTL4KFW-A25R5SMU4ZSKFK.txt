Title: Amazing Entry Level DSLR
Content:
This product was bought for a digital photography class. I grabbed this one because it was easy to use. Many features are nice. The full auto function works well.. But not when you are expecting something more... Also The lens that comes with this is OK. It gets the job done. However, It doesn't really allow you to zoom in very far. For example, I took a photo of a spider, however, I had to get about a foot away from it before it would zoom to the crop that I was looking for. The quality of the pictures is awesome! Even if you can't zoom in as far as you want, you could always zoom in on the computer and crop. The deep colors in this SLR are amazing. On the Landscape setting you get deeper and richer colors in your blues and greens. Kind of a post card effect. Overall, I am very satisfied with this SLR.

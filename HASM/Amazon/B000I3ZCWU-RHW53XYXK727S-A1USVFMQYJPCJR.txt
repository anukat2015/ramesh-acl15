Title: Excellent transition camera
Content:
If you are upgrading from a point & shoot, going digital for the first time or thinking about getting more serious with your photography, this is the camera for you. It's on par as far as photo quality with the 30D and costs a lot less. The full frame monitor is a nice step up from the xt and the add'l MP is great when you need to enlarge photos. I bought the kit with the standard lens, to start off with and quickly added the Canon 50mm f1.8. I hardly ever use the kit lens now and am saving for a new general purpose lens. If you can, skip the kit lens and get the 50mm prime and the Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L (if you have $1200) or the Tamron 28-75mm f2.8 XR as a great and much less expensive alternative.

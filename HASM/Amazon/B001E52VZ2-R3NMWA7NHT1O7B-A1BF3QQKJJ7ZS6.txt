Title: Good little vacuumn if you do not have pets and carpeting
Content:
I originally purchased this vacuumn knowing that I wanted a small canister unit that was easily stored as we have a small home. I also had only hardwood floors at the time. I did my homework and chose this one after reading all of the wonderful reviews. The vacuumn seemed to be exactly what I was looking for when it arrived. Suction seemed to be sufficient to clean my hard wood and kitchen floors. We then adopted a Golden Retriever & I put down a nice big area rug in our living room. The suction level of this vacuum just cannot handle having to pick up pet hair on the carpeting. I find that I have to constantly stop vacuuming in order to clean the pet hair off the bottom where it should be going up into the hose. I've also found that due to the lack of suction it gets caught in the hose itself as well. If you need a light weight vacuumn that doesnt need to do very much or you only have bare floors and no pets to clean up after it might work for you. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and look for another vacuumn with better suction.

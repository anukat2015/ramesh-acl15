Title: Nice Product
Content:
I'm quite pleased with this handy, good-looking little heater that puts out a sufficient amount of heat for when I'm relaxing in a chair and want to eliminate any chill in the air around me.  That it's made so it can be placed up against a wall and out of the way whether being used or not is a great feature, and almost looks like a built-in appliance. I don't find the fan very loud or annoying at all. Because the fan remains on as it thermostatically switches between the two heat levels (fan stays on until you turn the unit off), if I doze off I'm not disturbed/awaken from the sound of a fan turning off & on.

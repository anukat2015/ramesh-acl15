Title: Less for More
Content:
Just when you think it doesn't get any better, it doesn't!  The new 2nd generation Apple 4 GB iPod Mini Silver M9800LL/A is the new benchmark in over-priced electronics that provide music you already own, in a duplicative, unstable, portable format.  
Apple spared every expense delivering the new sleek design of the Mini Silver.  Sure to make you the envy of every kid on the block.  And the good news doesn't stop there.  Or does it?

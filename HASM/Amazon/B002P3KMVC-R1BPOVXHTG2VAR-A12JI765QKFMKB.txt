Title: Awesome!
Content:
I've had this laptop for nearly 2 months now. Great product. Very thin and light (under 4 lbs). The specs on this is awesome, let alone the price. It's a sleek, solid build with plenty of horsepower for everyday use. It's QUIET and the battery life is simply unbeatable. I can spend a close to an 8-hour work day without plugging in under normal use. Great machine all around. Can't go wrong with the Asus. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

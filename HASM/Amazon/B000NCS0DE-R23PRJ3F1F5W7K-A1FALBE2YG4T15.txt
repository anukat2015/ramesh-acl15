Title: Works well... cord gets in the way...
Content:
Very powerful hand vac that really does it's job getting the hair off of the furniture and curtains... however the cord is a bit of a hassle and gets in my way (even though it's long, I'm a little clumsy). One of the attachments broke and I can't seem to find it's replacement so now it's just a hand vac, which defeats it's purpose.

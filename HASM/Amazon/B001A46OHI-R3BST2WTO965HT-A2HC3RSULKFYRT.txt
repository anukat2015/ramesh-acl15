Title: For under $20, excellent
Content:
For under $20, this little heater is hard to beat.  Set on high, it quickly warms our kitchen, dining room, and living room from 68F to around 75F in about an hour.  This whole space is a little over 800sq. ft., and this is very impressive for such an inexpensive and little heater.  Once it reaches that temperature, we then turn it on to low to maintain the current room temperature.  Everything on this heater works great, except for the thermostat.  However, this is no big deal to me since I wanted a reliable and compact heater to warm up the living room area on the coldest of nights.

Title: Great for work...
Content:
I was searching endlessly for a small, quiet heater to use at work.  I needed something that was totally silent so I would not draw attention to having a heater under my desk.  This heater is awesome!  I place it under my desk on the lowest setting and it makes no noise at all (even at the higher settings there is no noise).  It only heats the area directly in front of it, which works great for my purposes - I can turn it on and the people around me never feel the heat.  While sitting at my desk I stay toasty without bothering anyone else.  I would definitely recommend this heater for anyone looking for an efficient quiet way to get a little extra heat in a small area.

Title: This heater is the BOMB.COM
Content:
This heater has saved us in the frigid cold of Boston Winter.  I give it a complete five stars.  The only thing I would say about it is that the red light can be a bit annoying at first.  Also, because it has circulating heat, it tends to dry out the room - I'm thinking of getting a humidifier as well.

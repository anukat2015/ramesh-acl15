Title: Pretty little netbook
Content:
This is a wonderful netbook. I bought it with 2G of RAM and purchased separately another DDR2 module - total 4G now. Doing this was piece of cake... Upgrading it to Windows 7 64Bit was also very easy, and all the drivers were recognized on the fly, during the process...
I love the design, and it's a very powerful netbook. This is no Intel Atom processor, it's a real Pentium. For what I use it, (software development) it's excellent. Also, the display, although tiny (no complaints, that's exactly what I was looking for), has an excellent maximum resolution.
I have to say, I love this netbook, needless to say, the price was an amazing deal. Overall, I'm really happy with it.
Thank you Amazon for your excellent service - I received it very quickly in 2-3 days.

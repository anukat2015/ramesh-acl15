Title: Little guy puts out a lot of heat
Content:
This is a small heater.  it definitely gets hot.
It is relatively quiet, but if you are in an otherwise silent place you will hear the fan.  It is probably as loud as a kind of loud computer fan.
There are 3 settings: fan only, heat, more heat.  
And there is a thermostat which will turn off the heater once that temp is reached.  However, in my cold apt, it almost never gets warm enough for it to turn off.
I haven't yet checked on my electric bill, but i have to imagine that it is drawing less power than the central electric heating in my apt.

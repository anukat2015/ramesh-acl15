Title: UNHAPPY
Content:
Sorry to say this unit I bought from Fry's is not good. The water pump has a rubber piece inside that will only last about 3 months of use before it gets a hole in it and spews water all over the floor. I am on my third rubber piece. Easy to replace be if you have hardwood floors as I do put the unit in a plastic tray or you will be sorry. I will not buy another. The company needs to improve the water pump.

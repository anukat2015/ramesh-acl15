Title: Nikon D300
Content:
The move to the Nikon D300 was made to take advantages of the newer features that were not present (especially the greater pixel capacity) in the D100 which I had for several years.  It was time to move up.  
The screen is larger with the ability to display additional information regarding exposure etc. The controls are neatly arranged and handle better than the D100 and it is more comfortable your hands.  Auto focus and exposure metering are much more advanced over the D100.
While I am still very much in the "learn mode" with this camera I am satisfied the move was worth it.  Having not moved to the D200 when it came out I cannot comment on the value of moving from that model to the D300. 
I had shopped around on the web only to find multiple cases of much lower prices but they did not include the typical box items of the charger, battery etc.  In this regard be careful of the lo-ball prices.

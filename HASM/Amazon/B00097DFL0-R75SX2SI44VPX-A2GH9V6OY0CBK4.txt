Title: Works for me
Content:
I bought this unit in June 06, so I'm on my 3rd year of almost constant summer usage. The unit is a little noisy (about the loudness of some fans set to their highest setting), but that doesn't really bother me because it cools the room like it is supposed to, and I hate heat more than noise :). This is the first year that I've had to empty the tank. It actually leaked a little, but since it wasn't on a carpet, that was ok. My bad, because it does say to empty it occassionally, and I was just being lazy. The rubber plug was a little confusing at first (I couldn't tell if I needed pliers to unscrew it, or just my fingers to pull it out), but I finally realized that it was "plug like" (i.e., just needed my fingers to pull it out of the pipe) rather than an "outside cap" type that needed to be unscrewed. The area that it is cooling includes my dining area, living room, and small kitchen. I keep the downstairs bathroom door closed, as well as the doors to the two rooms off of the staircase leading upstairs, so it's probably cooling about 450 sq feet. I placed a small fan between the dining and living room area to help "push" the cool air into the living room since there is a wall that blocks some of the flow. I bought a second unit for my brother in 07, and it also works well for him.

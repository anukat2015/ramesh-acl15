Title: Not great
Content:
We purchased this vacuum several years ago for our apartment with all wood floors.  The unit itself is just awkward.  The hose disconnects from the unit every time I vacuum.  The attachments fall off or come disconnected while using.  Storing the unit is annoying, as it constantly falls over and gets in the way.  The suction  is mediocre at best.  The HEPA filter needs to be replaced frequently, at a cost of $20 to $30 a pop.  I would not reccommend this product.

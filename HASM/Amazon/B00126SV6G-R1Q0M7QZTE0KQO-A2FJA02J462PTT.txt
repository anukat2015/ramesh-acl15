Title: Finally....
Content:
I used to have ZEN 8GB which had WSOD problem with the firmware 1.20.02
and I had to reset the player with a paper clip everytime I switched 
it on, therefore I returned it to the store.(I did not purchase that
one from Amazon, though)
However I did like ZEN's nice sound/video quality so I ordered 16GB to
Amazon to try just one more time. I was indeed so afraid of WSOD when I 
updated the firmware but it has been 3 days and has been working great
without any problem.(no single freeze or WSOD happened for 3 days)
Thank you so much Amazon! Amazon's shipment was also very prompt!
I love this small player and I carry it whenever/whereever I travel. 
I strongly recommend this player and hope that those who is thinking 
to purchase ZEN will get a good batch which is free from WSOD. If
you happened to receive a bad batch and experienced WSOD, you can just
return the defective one and try again.

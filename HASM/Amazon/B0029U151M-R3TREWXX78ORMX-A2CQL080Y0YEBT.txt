Title: Great combination of size, weight and battery power
Content:
Have been using this laptop for about one week now.  So far it has been wonderful.  It is not the fastest laptop I have had, but it has the best battery life, very light and thin, and can run the programs that I am intending to use it for without difficulty.  The screen looks great, the computer looks sleek and my daughter uses it for the whole day without needing a charge.  I bought it for her to use it at school, and neither of us are gamers.  The only negatives are the extraneous software that I proceeded to delete, and all the idiosyncrasies of the Vista OS.  I am sure it will be much better after I download Windows 7 in October.  
So far, it has exceeded my expectation for a laptop that I wanted to get for my daughter.  I would recommend it without reservations to anyone who are not planning to play serious games or do heavy duty video editing on it.

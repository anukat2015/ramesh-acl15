This is my favorite heater.  Heats my 16X18 bedroom and 12X10 Bathroom with no problems.  We have only gotten down to 25 so far this yr. but no struggles at all can maintain 70 no problem.  The remote is also an added little feature.  Read complaints about the blue led, give me a break use the thermostat and after about 1 minute after any adjustments it goes out.  Everyone acts like it stays on.  It is on just long enough to see what you are doing.....A+++

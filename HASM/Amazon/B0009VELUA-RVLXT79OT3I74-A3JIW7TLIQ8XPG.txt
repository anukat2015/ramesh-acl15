Title: Best coffee-on-demand coffee maker
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for over 2 months now. This is the best coffee-on-demand coffee maker. I like the feature that it beeps when the coffee is done brewing and then again when it shuts itself off. It seems to be well made and does not burn the coffee when set to the 4 hour warming setting. I have had two Hamilton Beach coffee-on-demand in the past. One seriously leaked after 6 months and another burned the coffee on the warming setting. So far, this coffee maker has been worth the extra money. Would definately recommend it for anyone that is looking for a coffee maker without a carafe.

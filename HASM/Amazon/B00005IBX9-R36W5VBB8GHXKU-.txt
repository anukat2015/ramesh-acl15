Title: Who told me to buy this disfunctional coffeemaker?
Content:
O.k. it's a great looking product.  Compact , stainless steel,whoa!  Black with fancy buttons, got to be great right?WRONG, this coffee pot is not potty trained.  I cleaned itout and so fourth, got ready for my delicious coffee.Man what a freiken pain in the butt.  I put the coffee andwater in the small water area, (not a problem to me persay).  I didn't know how much water I was putting in there.It takes forever to make coffee, I got this impression whenit took 14 mintues to clear out the 10 cups I used to cleanit.  OH BOY, what a suprise I got next.  I turned it on andcome back in a few mintues to get a cup of this 100.00 Joe, wholey crap batman.  The thing urinated all over mycounter.  Brown urine flowing all over.  I couldn't figure outwhy the aroma of coffee was so strong until I discoveredthis coffee pot has not graduated pre-school.Forget this!  I think I might have put the carafe' in the unitincorrectly.  O.k.  I'm a young adult , I should be able tohandle this.  How the heck can you put it in there wrong anyway.  Hey, it's either in there or it isn't.  I don't knowhow the coffee tastes because I couldn't measure mybeans to the water level because I don't know how manycups were in there anyway.  God help Cuisinart.  Theyneed some technical advise.  Sorry, I really wanted thisto be a good maker because I also tried the Delonghiretro version, read my review on that one too.  Whyis it so hard to get a good coffeemaker?  Keep yourmoney.  I'm going to try the Braun next.  I don't know whereelse to go.  Maybe I'll keep the hundread dollars andtreat myself to a few months of Starbucks.  Happy coffeemaking!

Title: Great Picture Quality
Content:
I can't believe my eyes that a SLR with less that $500.00 price can be so good. I bought it just three days and I love this. I take it where ever I go and the pictures comes great. I used mostly P/S/A and some times manual. And the picture quality is awesome. I was testing it tonight with almost no light at my room. I used tripod and the picture quality is like I taken it in a well-lit room. I am not professional or great photographer but I like to travel and like to take good pictures. And I think this is so far the best Camera for this price range. I was almost  going to buy Nikon D80 but after reading lot of reviews I decided to try this and I am glad I decided to buy this camera. It saved my 400 $ and  I can buy the 55-200VR lance with half of that price.

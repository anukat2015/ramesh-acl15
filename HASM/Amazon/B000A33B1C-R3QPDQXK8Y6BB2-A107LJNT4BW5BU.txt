Title: Great for a cold office
Content:
For anyone who has to suffer in a cold office, this is a great heater...silent, doesn't blow dry air at you, just emanates comfy heat.  I even put my cold toes on it sometimes.
There was a smell problem for a while, but that subsided.  One great feature is the timer...since it does take a while to heat up, you can set it to start warming your office before you even come to work.

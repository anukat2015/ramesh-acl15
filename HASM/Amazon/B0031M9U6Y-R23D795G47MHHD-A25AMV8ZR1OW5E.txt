Title: Awsome !
Content:
I'm a computer professional and picky about computers.  This is an awesome computer because its extremely light and comparatively powerful and battery long lasting.  This is a tiny machine and kind of waify in a good way.  Carry it with you everywhere.   The machine is fast out of hibernation and generally there is no drag.  Blue LEDs look nice.  Great beautiful display, but 1366x768 is not a full size and you will wish you had more vertical pixels at times.  Must fine tune the display pixel size and zoom the browser for older eyes.  I'll take the compact/light over the extra pixels - referring to 3.1 lbs vs 4.3 lbs - its a big diff to me.  Keys are not ideal but can be navigated.   Keep hitting "]" when I hit enter- DOH!!   Arrow keys are 1/2 size - yuck - c'mon Acer.  Mouse buttons are thin and tiny - too much so - ouch.   Its probably more a recreational computer than a student's research computer due to limited screen size/keyboard.   The Blue is nice.  I love it for what it is and not for what it is not.   Hope this helps.

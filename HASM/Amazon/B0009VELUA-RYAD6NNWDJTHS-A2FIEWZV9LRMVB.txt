Title: Good coffee but bad design
Content:
Just like so many others...it quit working consistently.  Unplugging and replugging would reset it, most of the time, but...  Anyway, I called today and, since the coffee maker is on backorder, they waived the shipping fee and, instead of having to ship them the coffee maker, all they want is the cord.  Hopefully, the replacement will have been redesigned.
Called again today, still on backorder.  I was offered the 14-cup with a carafe as a replacement and I took it.  Better than waiting forever....

Title: Not satisfied
Content:
I bought this computer for the sturdiness factor of a traveling business laptop.
It does seem much sturdier than my ACER TravelMate, but i find the computer to be very slow and clumsy.  
The user interface and the Lenovo programs that come installed are not as helpful as the ACER that I previously owned.  
I have been more frustrated with this computer than I have been pleased with an upgrade.

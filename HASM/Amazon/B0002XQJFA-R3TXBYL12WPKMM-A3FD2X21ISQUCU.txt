Title: Does what I need and then some...
Content:
This is my first DSLR, and it's doing everything I need and then some.  Solid build, great grip.  I bought it used from a friend who's been a photog for many years.  It's served him well for over 2.5 years; the stuff he's take on it is simply amazing.  Solid camera!

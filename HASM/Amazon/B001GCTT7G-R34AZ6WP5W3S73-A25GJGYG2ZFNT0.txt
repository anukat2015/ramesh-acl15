Title: 4 1/2 Stars- 5 if it had FireWire
Content:
It's mine and no it's not for sale.
Let me first say that this is the exact same unit Apple is currently selling as the 13" MacBook Pro excepting 3 things: SD Card reader (yawn), sealed in battery (yuck) and FireWire :).
I bought mine after the update despite it's lack of FireWire because it has a user changeable battery, which the MacBook Pro lacks.
Excepting the lack of FireWire, this is IMHO the best Mac Laptop made & if you can find a new one or lightly used one get it.

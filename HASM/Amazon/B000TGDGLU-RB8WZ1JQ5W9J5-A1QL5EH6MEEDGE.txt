Title: I like it ...
Content:
Although it takes a little while to feel the room heat up, this product does well in keeping a room warm once it "hits its mark".  I like the controls that can regulate the temperature.  Once you have the atmosphere you want you can either "notch down" on the watts or the dial; so it's not always pulling max electric energy, you can press the ComforTemp button.  It's quiet and portable.  So far, so good - I like it ...

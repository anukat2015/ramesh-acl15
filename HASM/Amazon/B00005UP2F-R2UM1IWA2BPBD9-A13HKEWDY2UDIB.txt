Title: Not ready for sale to consumer yet, get a Breeze or skip it.
Content:
Bought this due to the good Dirt Devil name, had a Mighty Mite and Breeze before and was very happy with them both. Wanted a canister with a retractable cord. Got the Vision and was not happy at all. There is no button to lock the debris container on the unit. Numorous times it came off/loose when moving the vacuum by hand. It has a handle on in, next to the main handle, make sure you grap the right one. The Wheels are poor, the vacuum drags across the pergo and tile floor, it DOES NOT roll. The wand is hard to use in any other position then normal. If you try to use your wrist to rotate it flat to get under a table, the plastic portion that you are holding rotates on the metal wand and you can't get it to rotate with out holding the metal wand right at the 90 degree bend, which is combersome and no very user friendly. Called Dirt Devil, they seemed less then concerned. I am sending it back and will get another Breeze, or perhaps a differant brand since the only canister that has a retractable cord is the Vision. This is not indicative of Dirt Devil im my experiance, but perhaps this is the 'new' dirt devil.
I looked all around my hometown to see a Vision in person, but no dealer had one, now I know why. For the price of this vacuum, it's not ready for sale, it seems like it was still in the design phanse then rushed out their door. Get a Dirt Devil Breeze, or antoher brand.

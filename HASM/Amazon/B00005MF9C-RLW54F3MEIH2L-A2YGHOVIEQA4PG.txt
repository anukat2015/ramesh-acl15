Title: Good personal coffee maker
Content:
I have had a good experience with this coffee maker so far, even though I have had it only for a month or so. 
Unlike many others, I never have any coffee grinds show up in the mug. Not sure if B&D fixed this problem with newer coffee makers. However, I am not too thrilled with the mug for the same smell reason that many others have already mentioned in their reviews.
But overall, a great value for the price paid.

Title: Sansa Clip 2Gb
Content:
Great sound quality though doesn't get as loud as my old Sansa M240.  It's size and weight are a huge plus and I don't even realize I have it sometimes and need to be careful.  Nice to be able to delete tracks using the MP3 player itself without needing to connect to a computer.  Never owned an iPod, now I don't have a desire to (yet).

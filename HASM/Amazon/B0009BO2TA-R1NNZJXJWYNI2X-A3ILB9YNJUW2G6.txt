Title: Hoover little orange canister vac
Content:
Outstanding value on Amazon. Bought one two yrs. ago at Hoover store for $80 vs. $50 something at Amazon with free shipping.  Arrived within 2 days of order.  Replacing old unit b/c wheel fell off.  Not worth fixing but will still use as back-up for hard floors on second level.  This is a powerful vac and fairly sturdy except for the wheel on the last model.  Metal extension tube is very sturdy but be sure to fit it tightly into the hose or it will tend to slip out and drop on the floor.  I bought a large brush accessory at the Hoover store with horsehair bristles.  Cost about another $20 but it makes vacuuming hardwood and tile floors quicker and easier.  This is a very powerful little vac.  Comes with accessory brush that doubles as crevice tool (top comes off) or leave brush on and it is great for vacuuming floor moldings and woodwork. Buy bags on-line in bulk for best savings.

Title: Good for 9 months only
Content:
Product did the trick for 9 months, then suction power went down dramatically.  I cleaned everything and reassembled to no avail.  I should have gotten it fixed then when it was under warranty, because at 13 months, it stopped working entirely.  And Hoover wouldn't help fix it because I was one month over warranty.  I might have gotten a lemon, but I now need to buy a new vacuum.  It turned out to be a very expensive vacuum when you average it out over the time it worked.

Title: Beware of Dell products
Content:
I've purchased nothing but Dell for years but I'll never buy another computer from them.  I shipped it in for repair. I told the Dell rep and wrote it three different places that the repaired machine had to be sent to my winter address in Florida.  But it was nonetheless sent to the wrong address.  It took me an hour and a half and fourteen different people to get to the right person.  That person emailed Fed Ex and told them to pick up the package and ship it to the right address.  But Fed Ex says there is literally only one person at dell who can authorize a package to be sent  to another address.  So after a week my computer still sits at the wrong address.  I don't have the time to deal with such incompetency.

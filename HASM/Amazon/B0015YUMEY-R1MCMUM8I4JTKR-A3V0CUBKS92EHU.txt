Title: 5 for design, 3 for OS (Applications crash often...), not happy about the heat dessipated
Content:
This is my first MAC, the expression when I got this mac was WOW! amazing design. Apple just rocks when it comes to design of their products... 
I like unix OS derivatives, I would have gone for a lenovo and installed linux on it, but mac seemed like a one stop shop though bit expensive compared to the other... maybe the beauty of the notebook made me buy it.
One of the driving reasons to buy mac was leopard OS, it has cool features, great to get yourself organized. However I still don't miss the application crash as that on windows pc, everyday I end up sending 4-5 crash reports to apple... thankfully the OS itself never crashed. 
I love the booting time of leopard, it is amazing fast compared to windows. I never have to leave the notebook in sleep mode, whenever u want just switch it on and boom it's ready to use... save some power ;)
Though applications crash quite often, they run amazingly fast... thanks to intel core 2 processor and 2GB RAM on board. The processing experience is just amazing.
I am not too fascinated about the usability of touchpad in mac... to scroll use two fingers (give me a break!!!) and for context menu double tap... I just feel it is stupid. 
The notebook gets awfully heated, other notebooks I had earlier were far better in this aspect... I rate just one star when it comes to this. Apple really need to take care of it.
Overall a good buy, but not a great one, for $2000 I expect something more...

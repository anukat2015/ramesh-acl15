Title: Ipod Nano 4g
Content:
I have the 4g nano, and I think it is just as good, and cheaper, than the 5g. I mean, if they come out with a video setting, you'd think that they would have pictures, too, right? I'm waiting for one that has both. The 4g is awesome, has great playback, and never seems to break down. I highly recommend it!

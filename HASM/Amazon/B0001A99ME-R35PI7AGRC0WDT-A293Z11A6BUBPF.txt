Title: Check out the Windows Compatibility Specs before purchasing
Content:
Love my new mini iPod but did not expect to pay an additional $100 to get it to work.  Although headlines tout "Windows Compatible", pls read the technical specs before purchasing.  I had Windows ME on my machine and had to upgrade to XP in order to use the device.

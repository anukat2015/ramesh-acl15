Title: Cheap Laptop
Content:
I own this laptop more than one year, and I can tell you that after 6 months my battery died, I call Dell and they replaced it very fast (During warranty-Currently I am on my own risk!!!).  After that I had to replace Harddrive because also failed.
These are cheap laptops but hardware will fail a lot...you need to be under a great warranty to be safe!

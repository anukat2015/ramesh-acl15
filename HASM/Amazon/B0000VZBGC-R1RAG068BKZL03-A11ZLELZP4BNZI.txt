Title: Some bad features
Content:
I also bought this product[...]. It makes good hot coffee but there are a few things I think could be improved upon. The grinding components need to be cleaned each time you use it because moisture from the brewing process goes up into that area and the coffee residue gets wet. The thermal pot is very nice but needs to be turned at an uncomfortable angle when pouring, especially when there is only a small amount of coffee left, and this can be problem for people that are physically challenged.
Lastly the grinder is extremely noisy, and doesn't shut off immediatly when the grinding process is complete, which can be a problem if your kitchen is close to your bedroom and you set the auto feature to brew coffee before you get up.

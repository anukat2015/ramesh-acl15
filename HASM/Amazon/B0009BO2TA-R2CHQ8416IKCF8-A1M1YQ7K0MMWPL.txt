Title: Hoover Canister ORANGE vacuum
Content:
I LOVE this little orange vacuum!  A lot of design and thought went into this vacuum.  It's light, but pretty powerful considering the size.  IT's perfect for my little house with hardwood floors and oriental rugs. I can literally carry it while vacuuming and it has a dial that you can actually vary the degree of suction with.  In other words you can turn the suction down far enough to dust delicate things like lamp shades, or up enough to vacuum rugs!  I've never seen this feature in any vacuum before and I love it.  It only has one attachment though, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It really could use a corner attachment so you could vacuum corners with something other than the metal pipe, (or the samll brush) that will scratch hardwood floors.

Title: Re-think purchase
Content:
I was going to purchase this heater.  Consumer Reports gave this a "very good" rating.  Then, I read the reviews.  Not impressed.  I have now decided not to purchase this item.  I will continue research to find a better heater.  What concerns me most is the high rating from consumer reports on an item that clearly has defects.  I've researched other heaters also and all seem to suffer from lack of quality, poor design, etc.  With all our technology, why can't manufacturers product a quality product?

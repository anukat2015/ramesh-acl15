Title: Perfect cup of coffee, every time...
Content:
I guess we've been lucky with our Cuisinart.  We absolutely love this coffee maker; best we've owned yet (we bought ours new about 2 years ago, so I can't speak for reconditioned units).  The coffee tastes wonderful.  We personally prefer paper filters over the gold filter.  We have found that a little bit of "residue" from the grounds seeps thru the gold filter, whereas it doesn't with the paper filters.
In contrast to some of the negative reviews, we use this coffee maker 6-7 days a week, and have not experienced a single time where the filter door comes open.  We also make sure not to overfill the water reservoir to keep it from overflowing (all coffee makers will overflow if you over fill them - not just this one).  :)  We have played around with the amount of beans or grounds to get the taste just right, and it definitely will make one strong pot of coffee if you want it to.
We don't always use the grinder, but I haven't had any issues when we do.  It really isn't that hard to clean, and I find it much easier than messing with a separate grinder and the frequent spills.  
The coffee stays very hot - for 4-6 hours, and it's not just lukewarm after that (and it still tastes good!).  Although I will say we pretty much finish off a pot before then... 
Love the automatic timer feature and being able to pour myself a cup before the pot has finished brewing.  The grinder isn't that loud, but I could sleep thru a freight train passing.  Ha.  It's definitely not any louder than the stand-alone grinders we've owned in the past.
I would give this one a definite thumbs up across the board.  Hope you have the same experience if you decide to buy!

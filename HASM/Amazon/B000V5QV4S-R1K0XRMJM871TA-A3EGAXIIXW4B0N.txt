Title: Faulty Camera/Lens
Content:
I am disappointed with my purchase. I expected to have flawless performance out of my camera for a long time. Actually it faulted within two weeks of initial use. The problem is that the lens, when on auto focus, sometimes does not allow me to take photographs as it is not communicating with the camera body. I have to shut the camera off or turn off the auto focus. It is really irritating to have such a glitch on a new camera. I expected a lot more. I would like to know what my choices are to start the process of getting the camera/lens communication problem corrected. Do I have to return the camera and lens and to whom and where do I send the camera? 
Regards,

Title: Great deal @ $299 price point
Content:
Recently received the one I ordered during Black Friday sale and have to say I am very pleased.  On the other hand, after a day or so of use, I'm confident that I would look elsewhere for a more powerful machine if I had to pay much more than the $299 I paid for it.  Biggest drawback: The CPU/RAM combination makes for heavy duty hard drive input-output in almost all programs/apps.  I suppose this can be improved upon by the addition of more RAM, which is something I plan to do when I see a good deal.  Back to the positive side: it does what I need it to do: streaming iTunes to the home entertainment system + web browsing + email; the display is bright and clear -- even when on battery power config.  Other pluses: full size keyboard is easy to use, and battery life looks to be near advertised spec under normal use.  Other quick observations:
(+) very light and compact, (-) but also very plasticy
(-) touchpad/pointing device is a little tricky to learn to use
(-) Series of 'important' (didn't select any 'optional') Vista updates took almost 3-hrs to complete/install
(-) moderate amount of bloatware programs, games, etc that needed to be removed
(+) free Windows 7 upgrade available for order through Acer's web site
(+) nice hard drive capacity (250GB)
Again, if you can snare one at or near the $300 price point, I highly recommend.

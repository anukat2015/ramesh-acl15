Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
I've been looking for a single cup coffee maker and I came across this Keurig B60. I wasn't planning on spending so much on a single-cup-type coffee maker but after reading all the great reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. I've only had this coffee maker for 3 days and so far I love it.  I've used both the K-Cup samples that came with the unit and also used regular Starbucks ground coffee (using the reusable filter).  Both ways produced delicious cups of coffee.

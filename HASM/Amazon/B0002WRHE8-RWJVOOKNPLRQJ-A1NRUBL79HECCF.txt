Title: Good overall heater
Content:
I have found this heater to be a pretty good product. I fished on Leech Lake in northern Minnesota with a temp of 15 degrees below zero and a 40 below wind chill. On the high setting it kept us adequately warm. The only reasons I did not give it 5 stars are the following: Inserting the batteries for the fan is nearly impossible, very poor design; When the fan is running it is pretty useless, I did not notice any difference when it was on; on the high setting it burns through both propane tanks in about 2 hours, I was expecting longer use and will now probably have to invest in the hose hookup for an external tank. On the postive side the unit is very durable. I throw it in my portable ice house and drive across oftentimes a pretty bumpy ride and it gets knocked around a little, filled with snow, etc. Still fires up no problem. The portable design is also nice for small areas like a fish house. Like I mentioned before, I wouldn't waste any money on batteries but get the external tank hookup.

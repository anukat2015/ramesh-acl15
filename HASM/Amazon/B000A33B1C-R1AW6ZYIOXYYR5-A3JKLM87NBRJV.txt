Title: Well worth the money
Content:
I have had this heater now for three or four weeks.  So far I have no complaints, for when the product is used in the space recommended it works great, it really does.  I tried using it in a room a little larger than the recommended 12X12, and the room had a tall ceiling, but it did not perform nearly as well as I thought it would (but, again, I can't complain, for this is trying to use the product in a way not recommended by the manufacturer).  So, if you have a room that is 12X12 (or maybe slightly larger) with regular ceiling height (8 feet), then you will not be let down by this heater.  Also, the timer works excellent, and the room is nice and warm for my wife, who gets up at 5:30 AM.

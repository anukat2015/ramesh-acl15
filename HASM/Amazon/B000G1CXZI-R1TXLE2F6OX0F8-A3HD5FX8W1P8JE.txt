Title: Stopped working after under warranty repair
Content:
I liked the product to heat up the bathroom in the morning. It also kept the bathroom dry and the towels warm. It stopped working at 11 months, was sent for repair under warranty and then worked again for 3 months. Not worth sending in for another repair even if covered. Will look for another heater.

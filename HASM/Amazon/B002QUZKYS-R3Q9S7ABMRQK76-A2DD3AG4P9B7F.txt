Title: Great machine except fr the keyboard
Content:
At first, I really liked this Acer.  Great display, Win 7 runs well, everything loads quickly, startup is fast.  The keyboard felt a little flimsy, but I figured it was me.  Yet, instead of my typing improving as I got used to it (I'm a pretty good typist) more and more errors appeared: many missed letters, r letters coming in double, just like another user reported.  In less than three weeks of use, the key for Q became stuck, and i had to flip up the flimsy little cover to get at the actual mechanism; eventually that hinged cover came off.  I spent a lot of time setting this macchine up, and to think that I will have to get rid of anything personal, like quickbooks and tax info so that I can get it fixed -- well, let's just say I'm NOT happy!!  Never mind lost productivity because I'll have to go back to my old, slow-as-molasses XP laptop.  I gave it three stars because everything else is great.

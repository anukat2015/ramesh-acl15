Title: Too bright
Content:
As others have stated, this item does heat a room. The downside is it is a killer on the eyes as it is way too bright. I am trying to find out if this horribly bright light is harmful to the eyes. It is so bright that it literally hurts my eyes, my child's eyes, and my husband's eyes.

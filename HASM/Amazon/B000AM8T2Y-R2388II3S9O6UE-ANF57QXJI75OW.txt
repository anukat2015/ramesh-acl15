Title: Meet "Sparky"
Content:
This is a pretty good, little, electric heater.  It's in an all-metal case.  It has a non-detented thermostat.  The detented power knob (Off, Fan only, I. (less power), II., III. (more power)) works much like opening a prescription pill bottle.  The plastic, hinged handle is nice, too.  I tested the tip over feature while moving it on the floor, and it works well!  The whole unit shuts off if it's even a little out of plumb.
"Sparky," as I named him, gets pretty hot.  The fan blows at what I'll call a slow to medium rate--sufficient to circulate the air and quite quiet.  The thermostat works well, too.

Title: Not Original Part-Generic
Content:
Purchased this believing it was an authentic Dyson replacement part.  This is a generic made aftermarket hose.  It is very difficult to see any differences in the pictures compared to your original hose, but it is not the same.  Cheaper quality construction, and the fit is not as good as original.

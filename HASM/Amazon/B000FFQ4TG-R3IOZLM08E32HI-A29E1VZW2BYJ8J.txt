Title: Bunn coffee brewer
Content:
This is probably our third Bunn coffee maker (in 40 years).  We've had others and think the Bunn is clearly better.  We love the quick coffee.  Our son serviced commercial coffee machines and said the Bunn is made similarly.  We make coffee every day and the machines have all lasted ten years.  I'm sure our next coffee maker will be a Bunn.

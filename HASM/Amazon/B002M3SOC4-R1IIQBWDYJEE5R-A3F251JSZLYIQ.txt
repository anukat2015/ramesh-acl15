Title: Ok,OK, OK... So I conformed.. there's plenty good reasons too!
Content:
OK,   
I tried my best to stick with Zune, I bought all the acessories, and updated to its most current platforms.  I sung it's praises and declared it the MP3 that will Kill the ipod.
I bought an Ipod.
Ipod is popular because IT'S  AWESOME! I was induced to purchase when one of my class mates texed me from hers.  My zune would only wi-fi to the marketplace to buy music from zune.  She also surfed the web. I could surf my music library on my Zune.  
Then the big motivation came.  I was able to get a discount on a Bar prep course (I wont say the name because I dont know if the promotion is still going on) if I bought an ipod touch.  that Discount in addition to  selling my Zune and all its acessories on ebay made the 32GB itouch basically free.   
Make no mistake the itouch is a palm-sized  computer.  you can surf the web, store documents, download applications, music, ect... Its basically a multimedia center in your hand. Graphics are crystal clear and its not sluggish at all you tap the screen or rotate the itouch and it responds immediately.  I did purchase the nike+ sensor to regulate my workouts. (dont purchase the receiver 32GB touch already has it built in, cool) I use the voice recorder with the earplugs and built in mic to record class lectures.  
  
There's a reason itouch dominates the market. It will organize your life.
Get one you wont regret it.
Sorry Zune, I hope we can still be friends.

Title: Very impressive DSLR
Content:
Upgraded my lighweight travel camera to the XSi from a Pentax iST DSLR. Very satisfied with the Canon.  Use a 5D for deliberate work but find it too heavy for a walk around camera.  Particularly like the ability to capture in RAW in the custom mode and immediately switch to JPEG capture in the preset mode by just turning the dial.  Also benefit from extending the telephoto lens when needed with the XSi.

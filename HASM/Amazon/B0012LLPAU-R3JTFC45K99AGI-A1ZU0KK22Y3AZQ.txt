Title: Best in its class!
Content:
Had no problem with it. I used it last winter. Very quiet. Delay start function is great if you know exact when you will be back to your home, and set the heater accordingly. So when you are home, the home is warm. And you thought only the rich folks can have that set up? It is compact and not too heavy. Excellent product. It is design to cover 1000 sq ft. I think it depends on where you put it and how the rooms are interconnected. It heated up my living room nicely which is about 700 sq ft. It can't heat the rest of rooms because they are separate rooms. it does not have an auto shut-off timer. It should have that feature but that is a minor issue. Good looking item. Good design so that kids can't hurt themselves. Retail Price is a little steep though. I got it locally for much cheaper when it was on sale at a store.

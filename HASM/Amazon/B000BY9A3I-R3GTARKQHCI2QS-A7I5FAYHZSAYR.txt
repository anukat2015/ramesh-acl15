Title: Died after less than a year
Content:
I loved this vacuum when I first got it.  So cute!  So light! So red! 
 
But I do not recommend purchasing it, because now less than a year later:
- The beater brush stopped working a few months ago.  I wondered why the vacuum was leaving dust bunnies back on the carpet - then I checked the beater brush and found it does not rotate any more.  Using the plain-floor brush on carpets does not work well either.
- The WHOLE THING then died and will not turn on.
I vacuum a one-bedroom apartment once a week.  Not heavy use at all, but I do need it to be able to pick up kitty litter that is on the floor.  It will not do it no matter how many times I go back and forth.
Spend your money on something else!  Because now I have to buy a new one and I will not buy this brand again.

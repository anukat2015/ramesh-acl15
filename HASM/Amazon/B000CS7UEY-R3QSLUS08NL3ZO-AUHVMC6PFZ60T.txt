Title: Almost perfect
Content:
I've had this product for about two years now.
The good:
- Durable, I have dropped it a few times and it's fine.
- Good sound
- Smaller than my last MP3 player (a Dell Jukebox)
- Beautiful - it comes with nice-looking preset themes (6) and the the outside is attractive
- Cheaper than an IPod for the same amount of space (30 GB)
- Can function as a planner, calendar, and can do two-way transfer with music and video, as well as can be a (albeit large) flash drive. This feature I LOVE and it kicks IPod's butt.
The bad:
- As mentioned, the touchpad IS very sensitive, but I don't find it bad. Ater you get used to it, even if you mess up the setting, you just tap it twice and it goes back.
- Kinda big. It is heavier than most IPods, and if you want to go running with your music on your arm, this is not the device for you. 
- It doesn't come with a charger - we had to buy it separately. Charging using the provided USB cord takes FOREVER and you have to have your computer on at the same time, which wastes energy and is obnoxious. But I bought the charger, problem solved.
- Because it's not an ipod, it's harder to find accessories for it. Also nothing cool is compatible with it (eg an i-trip), but that's why I have a CD player in my car.

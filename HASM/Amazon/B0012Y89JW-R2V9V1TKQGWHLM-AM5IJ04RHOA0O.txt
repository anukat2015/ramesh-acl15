Title: Great first D-SLR
Content:
Prompt delivery, packaged well and I was lucky to get a price I have yet to see anywhere else (saved $200!). The rebel xsi (450d) is everything it's supposed to, a great intro to dslr and a solid image quality for the price with the image stabilization feature. The only thing, strangely enough is that the body did not come with a rubber eyecup ( the soft layer over the viewfinder that covers around your eyes) and i'm not positive whether it was supposed it was supposed to be in the package or not, but likely it was missing. Aside from that, I had long since decided on this specific camera and got it fast, so to me, everything is perfect.

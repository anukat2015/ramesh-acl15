Title: Brew 'n Go
Content:
I have a commercial Bunn coffee maker. It brews great tasting coffee.The only thing wrong with the Bunn coffee maker is if you let the coffee sit awhile, it turns bitter. So by the time I'm ready to leave the house for work, I'm pouring one hour old coffee in my travel mug.. So I decided to try the Black & Decker Brew 'n Go.. I am glad I did.. The coffee brewed is just as good as a fresh cup from the commercial Bunn.  Makes a great cup of coffee, and keeps it hot and great tasting. Sometimes now I do not even bother using the Bunn...If you want a great single cup of coffee at home, or for travel. You cannot go wrong with the Black & Decker Brew 'n Go

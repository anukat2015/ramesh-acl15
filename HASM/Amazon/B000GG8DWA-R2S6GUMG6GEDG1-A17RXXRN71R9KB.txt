Title: good for the price but
Content:
This is excellent for a small cubicle but not effective to heat or warm up an entire room.
If you are sitting in a big room with this heater then you need to be as close as about 3 ft from the heater to feel any heat from it.
Instead if you put it in a closed room then it will definitely warm up the room but it will take some time to do that.

Title: Overall Great Value
Content:
After looking through a lot of options this camera seems to offer the best combination of price performance.
Some first impressions are:
1. Good Hi Iso Performance with little noise. (Much better then Canon Xt then I used to own that only had 1600 max iso.)
2. Able to do HD Video (720p).
 Video quality is ok, I compared it to my sony SR-12 HD camcoder its definitely not the same quality but it does have a unique movie type look to it, in low light its very grainy but in good light it does fine. Its a good back up to a camcoder, although you do have to get used to manual focusing to get good results. If you shoot a lot of movies get a bigger memory card, I have a 4 gig card and it only holds around 15 minutes of video in highest quality due to recording format.
3. First thing to do when you get the camera make sure you update the firmware to 1.01 that will solve the battery issue that many people been having. You can check which firmware you have by pressing the menu button and then turning the camera on.
So far a I took about 900 pictures and about 45 minutes of video on lithium batteries that came with the camera and only now the battery indicator shows orange.
4. As with any DSLR auto mode will not give you the best results, and every camera has its own "favorite" settings where it gets most consistent results. So far Im still figuring out what works best with this particular camera.
5. No camera is perfect but to me Good Hi Iso performance, Hd video option and price. Make it 5 stars.

Title: Not the greatest
Content:
I bought this after reading hundreds of reviews, both here and on other sites, when I concluded that this was the "best" for the money I wanted to spend.  I wouldn't give it more than 3 stars because:
1.  It took a week and many, many vinegar & water rinses to get the horrible plastic taste to go away (besides the initial set up which takes awhile).
2.  I didn't realize how much I disliked the fact that you can't see the water level from the outside, and since I typically only make 3-4 cups at a time (since I'm the only one that drinks it), I really have to fill the carafe first and then pour it in.  Okay, it's not THAT hard.
3.  It seems to take a really long time (compared to my now defunct old Braun machine) to make even 3 cups, I figure since it double-heats the water for the small batch function, but even for larger batches, it seems to take awhile.
So - I'm keeping it since I'm just too exhausted to search further and try something else.  I did even buy a Tassimo but took it back in one week since you can't top the convenience, but the coffee never tasted much better than instant to me, and I tried quite a few ($$$) different pods.

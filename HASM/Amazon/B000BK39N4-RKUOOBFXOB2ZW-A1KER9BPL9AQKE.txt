Title: A winner at this price point and better than Canon/Nikon
Content:
This camera is a backup DSLR to my professional grade Sigma SD14.  While it doesn't match the Sigma when viewed with a fine eye, it is extremely close.  The issue is what comes with the package and what it offers the serious amatuer photographer for the price.  First, the camera is well designed, comfortable and loaded with advanced features.  But the real advantage is in the Zuiko lenses.  The kit lenses that come with the Nikon and Canon varieties are not very good and not designed specifically for digital photography (translate to poor resolution at the pictures edges).  The Zuiko lens are designed specifically for digital photography and to add to that, are made with real metal lens mounts and not cheap plastic crap made in china. (Yes, only the professional Canons and Nikons are made in Japan).  If you upgrade Canon or Nikon to their pro lines, or at least go with their pro lenses, you may out perform the Olympus but not out of the box and you will pay more than twice as much.  And unless you want to make serious investments beyond the initial purchase, the Olympus will win the day every day. As a side note, the Leica lenses (among the best lenses in the world) being made for the DSLR market are 4/3 format lenses and will work with this Olympus but not with Canon or Nikon.  Happy shooting.

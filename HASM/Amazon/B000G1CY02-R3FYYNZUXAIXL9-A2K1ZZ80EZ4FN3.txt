Title: Exactly What I Needed
Content:
I just recently received and started using the DeLonghi Mica Panel Radiator, and it has worked perfectly for me thus far.  I was a little worried about some of the average and low reviews, but I have not been disappointed.  
There are a couple of important things to mention when deciding whether or not this heater is for you:
Are you patient?  This is not forced air heat, or directed heat.  A small to moderate amount of heat radiates from the front of the heater, and the rest rises from the top.  In an approx 200 sqft room, it took 1.5 to 2 hours for the heater to raise the temp from 55 degrees to 70 degrees (on the low setting).  Also, are you insulated?  If you have very poor insulation, you'll probably end up losing heat to the environment faster than you gain heat from the heater.
In the end, here's what I love about this radiator:
 - It's lightweight
 - It's small and very slim
 - It heats my room

Title: Great 1st DSLR
Content:
This is my first DSLR and my first SLR type camera. I love it! And am still learning about it.
The only frustrating thing is that it doesn't seem to have the ability to use the digital screen as a view finder.  I am, however, enjoying actually using the regular view finder for a change.

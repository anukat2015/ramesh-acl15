Title: LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
Content:
I have been struggling for 2 years with another top of the line coffee maker that leaked over and over on our limestone counters creating a whole new color.  FINALLY I tried this Cuisinart and I have nothing bad to say about it.  The coffee tastes great! Once you read the directions (yeah, you have to read it) it's not hard to program.  My husband was complaining constantly with our old maker about the temp. and it not being hot enough and he actually said that the Cuisinart coffee was too hot so I adjusted the plate setting.  Kind of a 3 Bears thing.  It has never leaked and we also use the paper filters instead of the filter for convenience. Can't tell a difference.  If I had to give constructive criticism it would be to design an easier top - but that's  about the worse I can say.

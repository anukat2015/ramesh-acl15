Title: Liked it, but had to return it!
Content:
I just received this vacuum and had to return it. Although it did a very good job on my wood floors and low-pile carpeting, there seemed to be a "short" in the handle. Whenever I pushed or pulled the handle the speed of the vacuum would alternate. Hopefully this was just a one-time defect because I did like the way it worked, it's light weight, etc. We'll try it one more time!

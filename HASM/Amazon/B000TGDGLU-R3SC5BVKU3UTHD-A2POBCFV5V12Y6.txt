Title: Didn't do the job for me
Content:
I received it in operating condition.  No problem there.  But after running full-tilt all night with both switches and the comfort button switched on and the "thermostat" dial at max, a thermometer 6 feet from the heater only got up to 66 degrees.  At 12' (the far end of the 10' x 12' room) it was 63.  Returned it.

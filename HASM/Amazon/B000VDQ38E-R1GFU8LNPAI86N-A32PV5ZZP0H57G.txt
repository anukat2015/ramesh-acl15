Content:
Just bought the Pet Hair Eraser vacuum. LOVE IT! I replaced a $300 vacuum cleaner that gave up after a year of normal use. I just finished using the Bissell and I have to say, I am very impressed at the results. The only negative is that the handle is quite heavy. My hand got tired several times. But it's worth it.

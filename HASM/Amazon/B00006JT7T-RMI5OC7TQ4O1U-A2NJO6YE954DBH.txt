Title: It is -56 tonight and this little heater is keeping me warm
Content:
The wind chill hit -56 this morning (only -28 otherwise) and fighting the cold trying to come through the brick wall that makes up the back wall of my ground floor basement office is the Bionaire Galileo Digital Triple Ceramic Heater.  Not only that, this little heater is winning the war.  By that I set the temperature that I want and this little unit hits the mark.  Granted, it is rather strange to have a remote for your heater, but the controls are fairly simple.  You push &quot;mode&quot; until it unlocks and then you have five choices: high, low, high automatic, low automatic, and off.  For the most part automatic is how you want to go and low works fine unless you are trying to play catch up.  The three directional heaters are nice because it works perfectly in a corner, in my case underneath the table.Yes, a timer that would go off every morning to start heating up your designated area before you were up and about would be nice, but it is not that much of a problem to reset it each night and in the morning.  It takes less than 10 seconds to do this.  This unit will warm things up pretty quick once it gets going, so this is a minor inconvenience at best  (especially in terms of what is on the other side of that brick wall down here tonight).  The Bionaire Galileo Digital Triple Ceramic Heater is one of those items that once you discover it you wonder why you waited so long to get one.  This is the first winter in the Zenith City where I have not been wearing my turtlenecks and sweaters all the time because of what this little unit can do.

Title: Surprisingly good
Content:
NOTE: I don't have this exact model so I can't comment on the bells and whistles (clock, timer, automatic-start function), but the model I have looks to be identical in every other way.
Picked up the #47535 BrewStation (the non-"Plus" version) a little over a week ago from Woot for only 20 bucks, figured it be a nice addition to my office but given the cost, didn't have particularly high expectations. Even so, the BrewStation has exceeded them by a nice margin. Easy setup, easy operation, easy cleanup. Keeps coffee quite hot without scorching. Very convenient for a work environment - I can literally reach over with one arm and fill my mug without so much as moving my chair. Doesn't take up much deskspace.
I gave this four stars instead of five because of a few minor issues. First and foremost, you have to run a few cups of vinegar followed by several plain-water flushes through it to get rid of a nasty plastic odor, which in my case took almost two hours altogether... coffee has smelled and tasted great ever since, though. The filter basket doesn't seem to fit perfectly on top of the coffee container, so it never feels like it's properly seated even though it's in the right place - hard to understand unless you see for yourself. Finally, the lid drips condensed water all over the place (primarily down the back of the BrewStation) when you first open it after brewing. Simply put a couple of paper towels under the unit and it becomes a non-issue.
All in all, one of the best under-$30 purchases I've made in quite awhile. Even at the higher price here on Amazon, I would be quite happy with it.

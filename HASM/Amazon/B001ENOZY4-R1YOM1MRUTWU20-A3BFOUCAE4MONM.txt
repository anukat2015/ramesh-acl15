Title: First Impressions
Content:
This was my first digital SLR purchase following a history of compact digital purchases and 35mm SLR's.It arrived on my doorstep a few hours before Hurricane Ike and was a lot more welcome !
 The initial impression on just recieving the box was one of quality and the camera has lived up to first impressions.
The camera is a joy to use with super fast response and a really excellent LCD screen to review my efforts.
I have not made more than a trial use of the HD quality video, but I saw enough of its potential to be suitably impressed.
My only wish would be a for a glossier more descriptive manual to enable me to utilise more of its features without spending time coming to terms with geekish phrases and wishing for a better pair of glasses.
I am glad I bought this and not Cannon Rebel !

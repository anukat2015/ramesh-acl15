Title: Not reach my expectation
Content:
Bad things:  The touchpad is quite annoying.  I can only use my mouse.  There is some wrong with the  microphone and speaker.  The voice is too low so that the person who chat with me can not hear me clearly.  The life of the battery is only 6 hours.
Good things:  The cooling system is good.  I like it!  The price of this computer is not too high.  It's still a good deal.

Title: Great little vac.
Content:
I also purchased the Shark Power Pet at Target, because that is the only place I could find it. I live with a long haired dog and a long haired cat. I also have severe allergies. This is the first vac that I have owned that actually picks up all of the hair and reduces allergens! I have owned expensive vacs that have not worked nearly as well. I do keep the filter clean and even empty the dust canister at least once while cleaning. This vac also has wonderful attachments. I even dust with it! I think that I really got more than what I paid for. You just need to smart and use as directed and this vac will do what it says it can.

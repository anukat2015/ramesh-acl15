Title: great, quiet vacuum
Content:
I used to own an Electrolux (really Eureka) Oxygen, until the plastic handle melted as I was vacuuming (really! That was a first).  So after a lot of research online (thank you, Amazon!) I bought this Panasonic, which is definitely living up to expectations -- it has great suction, it literally takes off on carpets, and it does a great job on hardwood floors too (I was skeptical about that because it doesn't come with a separate hardwood floor attachment, but it works fine without it).  Plus it's relatively quiet -- not super-quiet, but much easier on the ears than most vacuum cleaners.  It also rolls easily from room to room.  I don't have a problem carrying it upstairs, unlike another reviewer who thought it was too heavy.  Overall I would definitely recommend this vacuum cleaner -- it's actually a pleasure to use.

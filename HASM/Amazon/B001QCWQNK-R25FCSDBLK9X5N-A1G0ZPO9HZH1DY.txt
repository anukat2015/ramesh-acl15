Title: Love it
Content:
I just got it the other day so Im still getting familiar with it..
2 things so far VERY little issue...
Battery takes FOREVER to charge I dont let it get down to where it in the red zone either...
also cant believe price jumped up at bit strange......
but get it worth it I am windows user since 96 and this IS much simpler to navigate. Will be even more when I get fully used to it...
Maybe a bit pricy but apple makes it worth it. Just be wary of new upgrade of new OS I heard its buggy.... 
So I didnt upgrade with the disc that came with machine...

Title: Rebel XTi- Great Camera!
Content:
We bought this camera after we had our first child--and everyone comments on what outstanding pictures it takes. We get such great pictures of our baby, there's just no need to take him to a professional studio!  It's very easy to use and we are slowly learning all of the many things the camera actually can do.  But, initially, it's as easy as point and shoot for perfect pictures.  The lens it comes with is perfect for indoor and closer objects, but in the future we will probably invest in a better lens for zooming on things further away.  Great camera--would recommend to anyone!

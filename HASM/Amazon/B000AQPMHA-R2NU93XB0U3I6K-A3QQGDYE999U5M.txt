Title: Best coffee maker on the planet!
Content:
I love this coffee maker! My brother got one, and I tried it once and I was sold. its quick, convenient, and has a huge variety of coffee cups you can purchase for it. My favorite is the Donut Shop coffee (which I am drinking as I'm writing this). Ive never had a single problem with this machine, and I use it every day. Plus, there is virtually no clean up needed unlike a conventional coffee machine.

Title: High quality vacuum
Content:
This vacuum has exceeded my expectations. It's nice to have a cannister vacuum again after having an upright for years. This new Hoover easily glides under the bed, so now I can easily clean there each time I vacuum. It really picks up the dirt and gets the carpet and the floors really clean. The rotating hand attachment is really nice and pulls the dust and cat hair from the furniture really well. There are several attachments and I've used them all. The cannister is easy to maneuver and is quiet for a vacuum. I have to empty the dirt cup after every cleaning but I don't mind--it's a reminder of how much dirt and dust the vacuum is pulling up. The dirt cup empties easily with very little dust escaping into the air. I just empty it into the trash. I'd highly recommend this vacuum to anybody that's looking for a quality cannister vac.

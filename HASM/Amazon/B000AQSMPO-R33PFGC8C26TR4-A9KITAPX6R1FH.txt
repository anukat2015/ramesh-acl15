Title: Great coffee maker, and possible noise solution.
Content:
I love the versatility of this product, the variety of the coffee and the ease of use.  I like coffee very strong and while the normal cups are not, the extra bold (Green Mountain Dark Magic, in particular) cups make a great medium size cup.  As with any pre-measured coffee, the more coffee you make from the portion (k-cup, in this case), the less strong it will be.  If you want to keep the brew strength the same, you need more coffee - so if you are making a double size travel mug, use 2 k-cups.  (This is no different from making coffee with a regular coffee maker - if you want stronger coffee or if you want more quantity at the same strength, you use more coffee).
As for the noise, the machine hums for about 20 seconds after making a cup of coffee, as it pumps water from the reservoir into the heating chamber.  I found that it is somewhat loud (but not unbearably so, by any stretch) when the removable cup holding plate vibrates against the machine as the pump is going.  There are two ways to significantly limit this vibration noise - you can simply move the plate away from the machine a bit, or you can do as I did, which was to stick some small rubber or foam pieces (such as a small strip of adhesive-backed foam shelf liner) on the side of the plate that normally comes into contact with the machine.  This made a huge difference in reducing the noise and I can now classify the machine as relatively quiet.

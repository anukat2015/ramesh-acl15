Title: Kruz For Dog Hair
Content:
I bought my Kruz about a week ago. With the charge that it had upon receipt I was concerned that I had wasted my money. After charging it over night, though, the difference is night and day.
As my title suggests I bought this vac to pick up dog fur on hard linoleum covered floors in my basement. This thing is perfect! No, it won't replace your main vac for carpets, but that's not what it's designed to do. If you have hard floors and want to keep them free of pet fur this item will do that easily.
My review is this, if you want to sweep hard floors this little gem will do it. It does that for me perfectly. I bought mine for $54 including shipping. I feel like a thief. Look for the bargain and pounce on it. You won't be sorry.

Title: Great quality, ease of use.
Content:
I like finding a producut that works like it is supposed to, is built well, durable, and is simple in it's use.  I use it to connect my propane stove to the Mr Heater tank tree.  I also have the 12' version to connect my Mr Heater catalytic heater a safe distance away.  You can use the bulk tank to run any accessory with the standard one pound disposable tank threads for amazing amounts of time and saved money.

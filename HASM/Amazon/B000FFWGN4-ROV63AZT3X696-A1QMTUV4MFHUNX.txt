Title: Underwhelmed...
Content:
I read tons of reviews for this vacuum before I purchased it, and everyone loved it... except me!  I don't have any pets, but thought it would be great for any carpet since it picks up pet hair, but I was very under whelmed.  Pros - it's easy to put together. Cons - didn't work as well as I expected.  It had mediocre suction.  I ended up returning it and purchasing the Bissell Velocity.  LOVE IT MUCH BETTER.  Cool purple color, picked up so much debris and fuzzies off my carpet, I had to empty the canister 4 times (and I'm not that dirty!).  So my assessment is no-go on the Pet Vac.  I love the lift-off feature, makes it great to carry around and light!

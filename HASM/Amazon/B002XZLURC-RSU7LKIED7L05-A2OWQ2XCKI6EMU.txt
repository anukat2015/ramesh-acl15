Title: best for school!
Content:
It took me a whole year to find a laptop I really wanted. Since early 2009 when netbooks were on their way to their demise, I was really looking for a laptop that was small but had good battery life and didnt have any unnecessary protruding extremities (like ugly external batteries!)There are much cheaper option, like the Acer, but they cannont not compare aesthetically to the asus. 
I love this laptop, and I only paid 750 for it! It powerful enough to play the Sims, (YAY!), but light enough to last for 9 hours doing homework! Which is the real reason I bought it! I have so many online classes that I need to do them on the go and this laptop makes it possible!
It never gets too hot on your lap so you dont need to worry about overheating that much. Its small enough that it easily fits in a bookbag or totebag comfortably. The keys are comfortably spaced and the only one that need some getting used to are the side keys! (but that's easy!)The function keys are easy to tell and very useful.
This is my first laptop and I am very glad I waited. Asus makes top products and I encourage anyone looking to buy a laptop to take the time to really research to you find exactly what you want!! 
The only gripe I have is one of the small rubber bumpers on the bottom came off and now I cant find it! I am going to see if I can buy some more later.

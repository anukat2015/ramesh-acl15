Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
Great Vacuum, very impressed, Lighter and smaller than most vacuums, does a great job! Three different settings, min, max and auto, this would be used from carpeted floors to bare floors such as hard wood or ceramic. Canister has a bag which you do have to empty like most vacuums.  Bags you can order on amazon or you can get at Lowe's or Best Buy. Would definitely recommend if you have allergies, canister is sealed ,no dust flying around. Would recommend this vacuum.

Title: Archos 705 big problem they need to fix
Content:
This is a slam dunk video player, BUT...
The 705 (at least the 80 gig model) has a serious defect:
When playing videos, every time the hard drive spins up to load more data, the video pauses for up to one second. This was a known issue on the 604 and 704, and they released firmware updates on both to correct the condition.
I am on my second unit, the first being replaced with a new unit on RMA, and BOTH have the exact same issue. I have been calling Archos every day to report the problem and get some action. So far, they seem to just be ignoring it. So don't buy until you see a firmware update where they address this issue, or this player will drive you NUTS. Every 4 to 6 minutes there is a one second "freeze' while the disk cache is filled. Very very annoying. Makes it hard to sit down and watch a movie on it, and if you use the SPDIF output, it actually loses the audio for one second, it just goes silent.
COME ON ARCHOS ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.
If you look at the firmware update history for the 604 or 704, you will see:
Version 1.6.20
-----------------
Improvements:
- Photo: allow to turn slideshow transitions off
- Videocorder & Audiocorder: audio gain is now from -12dB to +10dB
- Videocorder: Widescreen setting in now saved
- PDF: Added right to left language support
Bug fixes:
- Video: high bitrate VOB files with AC3 played jerky
- Video: fix video playback pausing for a second when buffering from disk starts
That last line above is EXACTLY THE PROBLEM WITH THE 705. THEY HAVE TO KNOW THIS EXISTS, SAME AS ON THE 604/704
SO FIX IT OR DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE.

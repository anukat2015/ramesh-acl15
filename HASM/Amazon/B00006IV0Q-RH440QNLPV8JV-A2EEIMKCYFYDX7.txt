Title: Not as strong as I had hoped
Content:
I bought this based on reviews that said the coffee was much stronger than drip grind.  I'm sure that it does brew much stronger coffee than many drips, but I had to use more coffee in it and it still did not have the same strong flavor as my Krups did. Brewed VERY hot coffee however, for those who like it to start off that way.  Overall, a very good backup pot for me.

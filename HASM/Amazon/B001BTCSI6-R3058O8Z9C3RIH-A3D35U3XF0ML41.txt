Title: It's fantastic
Content:
Most internet reviews about the D700 say it has only 12 Mpixel. For most photographers, that is more than enough. One positive thing is rarely mentioned: for close up photography, we can use f16 (for more depth of field) without the cost of diffraction. With higher resolution cameras, we better stay at f8. I do not want to say about other good things since they are already said. For me, it has one bad thing: I do not want to use my DX cameras any more.

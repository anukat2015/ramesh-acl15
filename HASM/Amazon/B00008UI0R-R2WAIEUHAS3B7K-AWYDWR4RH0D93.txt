Title: Good Vacuum but...
Content:
I like the suction of this vacuum and it is portable.  My problem is their claim that the filter is washable.  DO NOT WASH THE FILTER.  I vacuum mine with our shop vac or clean it out with canned air.  This needs to be done about every other time you clean the house.  We have alot of pets and almost all hardwood floors so I know we ask alot from the vacuum.  When I washed the fister, after cleaning it with the little tool they provided and waited three days not just the one they recommended the filter molded and stunk up the house and grew a nasty film on it.  In their defence, I contacted Hoover and they shipped a new one as a courtesy, but kept implying that I didn't follow directions.  The handle also feels flimsy but has worked well and I like that it is easily adjustible.

Title: Check the model number!   Bait and switch?
Content:
Model #82700 is more expensive than model #82660.  As far as I can tell, the only difference is the length of the retractable cord.  
The 82660 has a 15' cord (actually about 13 1/2 feet when fully extended) and the 82700 has a 20' cord.  
I thought it was worth the extra expense to have the longer cord.  However, while I was charged for the 82700, I received the cheaper 82660.  They promptly sent me another, but it was also the wrong model.  So, I had two large boxes to re-pack and take to the post office.  I received an email from Amazon (1 month ago!) promising to resolve this issue.  I have not heard from them since.  
At present, I don't have the vacuum cleaner and have not received a refund.
I agree with the other reviews. Except for the short cord, this seems to be a really good vacuum cleaner for the price (for hard floors, not carpet).
My low rating is due to the really poor service I've received.  I presume that this 'bait and switch' tactic is not condoned by Amazon, but they have done nothing to follow-up and resolve the issue.
So, if you purchase this item, be sure to check the label on the bottom to make certain you've received the correct model.  
Even if the shorter cord is not a problem for you, you should get a refund for the price difference.

Title: fast and convenient, but coffee too weak
Content:
Being an engineer and coffee lover I had to check out this neat machine.  The problem as it appears to me, is that the water is injected into the K-cup in a fast concentrated stream that misses a good portion of the coffee grounds.  The hot cocoa K-cup, which was also too weak, had about a teaspoon of cocoa powder left inside.  With 7oz of water I expected stronger flavor from the generously sized and sealed K-cups.  It's also a bit noisy at 5am.  On the positive side it is fast and easy, make great hot water too.

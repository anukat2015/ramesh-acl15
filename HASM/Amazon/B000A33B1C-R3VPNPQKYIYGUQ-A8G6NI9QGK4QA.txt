Title: not bad for heating a kitchen
Content:
I am happy with this little heater. It heats my kitchen to a nice warm temp quickly and didn't make the electric bill jump to much. I wiped down the heater after it arrived with a wet facecloth and only noticed a smell the first time of use. good for the price.

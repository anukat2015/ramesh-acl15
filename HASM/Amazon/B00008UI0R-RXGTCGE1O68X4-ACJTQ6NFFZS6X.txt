Title: This thing is freakin awesome!!!!!
Content:
After months of disappointment with the 4 "dead" uprights that I have laying around my house, I came across this. I was trying the find the best thing to clean up pet hair and all my research pointed me toward a canister. As soon as I got this we tried it out and it is FABULOUS. The uprights that I had kept clogging and burning out. I tried everything from a Eureka to a Dyson-yes Dyson and they all were fried with two passes through my living room. This vacuum is self-propelled, suction controlled and easy to manage. The ONLY downfall to it is that the canister is small and I need to empty it a lot while going through my house. As far as getting rid of the pet hair....I have two large dogs and three cats, but you couldn't tell it. I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone with pets. Oh-another bonus....It's quiet so it doesn't scare the animals in to a stampede.

Title: Good hot coffee but reliability issues.
Content:
The first worked great. Nice, hot, good tasting coffee. But the 10's unit on the display stop working on the 3rd day. It made it difficult to set the time. Amazon promptly sent a replacement unit. The 2nd unit had a slow leak. The first morning I found approximately 1 cup of water had leaked before it started brewing. It was very evident that it was coming from inside the unit not an accidental spill. I had high hopes for the unit from all the user reviews. It did make a good cup of coffee but I can't put my faith in a brand that became defective within days. I will look for a different brand.

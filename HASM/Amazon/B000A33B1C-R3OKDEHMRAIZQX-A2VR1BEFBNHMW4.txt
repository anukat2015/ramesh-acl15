Title: toxic heat
Content:
I bought this in November, 2006 and wanted to use it in my bedroom while I kept the thermostat down in the rest of my apartment to save money.  A plus for this item is its three settings, but the thermostat is very confusing to use.  I can't say if the heater has saved me money or not.  However, a BIG NEGATIVE is that it gives off a lot of fumes.  the brochure says it only does this when its new but that seems to be very untrue.  It smells a little like kerosene combined with a funky musky odor and it emits this constantly.  I found myself getting sick: chills in my hands, feet and legs as well as shortness of breath.  the heat it gives off is very good, a strong radiant heat that heats the whole room (my room is about 12' by 12'), but the fumes are actually a health hazard and I believe this heater should only be used if you are able to ventilate your room while you are heating it (which kind of doesn't make much sense).

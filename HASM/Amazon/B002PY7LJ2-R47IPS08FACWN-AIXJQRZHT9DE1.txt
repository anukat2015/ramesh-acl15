Title: It has been everything I need and more
Content:
I am no "power" PC user, but since starting my business on Thanksgiving Day, 2009, this has been my complete office-in-one.  Running a Social Media Marketing business from my laptop has been the most fun I've ever had, and when I went shopping (A full day of visiting computer and electronics stores) for my one-stop office solution, this little red computer really jumped out at me.  It was one of the first laptops I looked at, probably because of its striking red color, and it was the basis for all the other computers I looked at that day.  If you knew me, you'd know I am not impressed by flashy gizmos or blinking lights.  I drive a white Toyota and live in an apartment, so looks were not when captured my attention.  It was the expanded 250 GB HHD.  It's not fast, but I don't need that.  I'm not a webmaster, I'm an entrepreneur and I leave all the tech stuff to the tech guys.  I just need to get my email, be mobile and (since I have a 2-year old) I really don't need the weight of a full sized laptop.  So even though most Power Users would probably give this little guy a 4-star rating, I give it a 5-star with enthusiasm.  It's the big boy laptop in a very light and portable body.  Great Job Gateway!

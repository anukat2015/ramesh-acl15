Title: Very happy cutomer with Amazon and product.
Content:
I wanted to say I am very impressed with the layout and comfort of the keypad, nice looking computer with some nice options for software with the assist button which launches Vaio care a easy do it yourself PC maintenance tool, for those who maybe are not real comfortable keeping their computer cleaned up and running at it's best performance.
There are 4-USB pluggins three on the right and one on the left, A web connection only button which is a nice option so there's no need logging onto your desktop if your in a hurry or just have need for the web.
Easy to use touch pad with a real nice feel and good control, but I use a mouse because that's what i am more comfortable with. Good power saving setting options in control panel. The speed and setup were everything I expected, I have had this computer for about 3-weeks now and the only drawback that I have is the speakers they are suppose to be stereo but they sound a little tinny definitely not for playing music on I will need to pickup some good USB speakers down the road.
I am sure this Sony has many more options and software which I have yet to use when I find time.
Hope this helped.

Title: The most annoying machine I've ever owned
Content:
I have the same problem several other people mentioned -- the drive belt slips off frequently. It does that when I lightly bump the carpet cleaner against a piece of furniture, or when it sucks up the carpet fringe . . . or just when it feels like it. Then it's a big deal to take it apart and put the belt back on and put it together. I don't have the other problems people mentioned, except the dirt cup fills up fast. That's probably because I avoid using it so there's lots of dirt when I do vacuum. What a waste of money!

Title: Easy set-up, easy use, works well.
Content:
This heater seems to be as good as claimed. You do need to be sure to set it up as instructed. First burn outside. Adjust wick as instructed. Have only used it a few times so far, but am pleased. I've discovered virtually identical heater labeled with different names around. Assuming one manufacturer makes it for different companies. (much like major appliances). The up side to this is that hopefully wicks made for various named heaters will be interchangeable. Have not had to replace wick yet, so we'll see. Overall happy with product.

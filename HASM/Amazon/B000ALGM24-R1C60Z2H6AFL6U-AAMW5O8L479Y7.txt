Title: WOW! Everyone should have one of these!
Content:
I am a 39-year old single mom and it took me 20 minutes to install and program this! Read the directions! I was trying to save money on energy bills, but was tired of waking up to a freezing house! Problem solved for $45! 
It says it has 4 programming slots per day which for example I programmed for Heat (Winter):
1 - 5:30am 75 degrees (we wake up get ready for work/school)
2 - 8:30am 67 degrees (we have left for the day)
3 - 5:30pm 75 degrees (we are home for dinner and homework)
4 - 8:30pm 67 degrees (we are in bed for the evening)
You can program weekdays all together or individually, same with weekends.
Very easy to change program if you work different shifts.
This will save a bunch of money and energy! And I love coming home to a cozy, warm house knowing that it was saving energy all day :)

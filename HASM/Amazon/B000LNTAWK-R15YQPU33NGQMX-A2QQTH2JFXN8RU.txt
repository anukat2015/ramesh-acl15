Title: D200 - robust design, great pictures!
Content:
I'm not going to write too much about the photographic aspects of this camera - it looks like it's covered abundantly, and suffice to say the camera is probably beyond the capabilities of most of its owners (myself included).  It capable of taking great pictures, suffice to say.
I'm writing partly in response a comment further down about an individual that was experiencing problems with the sensor, and partly thanks to an episode of Survivor Man (oddly enough, I know).
I noticed on the Amazon episode of Survivor Man that Les was experiencing difficulties keeping his camera gear dry and working.  I returned from the Amazon Rainforest myself just this past July, having spent two weeks in the jungles of Peru with my D200.
I was very pleased with it's operation - never once did I experience a problem, in fact.  Paired with the 28-70 f/2.8, I took the camera on a small canoe on the Amazon itself and into the rainforest for extended amounts of time. I took pictures with it on a tripod while a tropical storm poured down from overhead, and I had it in the hot midday sun where the lens became hot to the touch.  Again, regardless of the environment I had it in, never once did it even hiccup.
Anyway, I thought I could offer a testament to its extreme durability.  Part of my interest when purchasing a DSLR was to have a strong, weather-proof design, and the D200 shined admirably.

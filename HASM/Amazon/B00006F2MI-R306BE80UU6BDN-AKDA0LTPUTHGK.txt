Title: Great Coffeemaker, but not entirely dishwasher safe
Content:
We've had this coffeemaker for about 4 years now.  We noticed recently that the carafe was no longer keeping heat very long at all, and recently had to purchase a replacement carafe.  Do NOT put the carafe in the dishwasher, bottom line.
This coffeemaker requires a little bit of effort.  You have to clean all of the parts every day. But it's a lot less messy and a lot more accurate than measuring out the grounds and grinding them in a separate container.  If you have to have freshly ground coffee, this coffeemaker is perfect for you.
As for the carafe, it worked great for the first couple of years we had it.  We're going to ignore the manufacturer's directions that it's dishwasher safe and hope that our (quite expensive at 1/3 the total cost fo the coffeemaker!) carafe is as good as the old one used to be if we don't destroy it in the dishwasher.

Title: Incredible Nikon!
Content:
After loving my first Nikon - a D70 for several years, I decided to trade up when the latest wave of new high-end digital SLRs came out. After looking at the D80 (which is a great follow-up to the D70 / D70S), I couldn't justify the extra money for a moderate trade-up even with the increase to 10.2MP. It's not that the D80 isn't a brilliant camera for the serious amateur, it's just that the D70 was so great that to follow it up begged something really extraordinary.
After playing with a friends Canon (just to make sure I wasn't overlooking their recent offerings), I tried a D200 and immediately fell in love with it.
I find the D200 even easier to use than the venerable D70 in spite of the fact that the D200 has so many more customizable features and is much more capable.
The camera just feels right in your hand and inspires confidence with it's handling and fantastic build quality.
It's been just over one year now and with all the incredible shots I've taken with this camera, my wife has just conceded that it was a great purchase.
I'm not sure what will tempt me to trade up in the future. The D200 is perfectly intuitive, feels great, performs flawlessly, and takes amazing pictures. You can't ask for too much more than that.

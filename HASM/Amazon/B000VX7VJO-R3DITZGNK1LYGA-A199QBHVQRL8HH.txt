Title: Breville single cup
Content:
I have now used the Breville BKC600XL single cup brewer for two months. I use my own Ethiopian coffee and I purchased extra coffee filters. Excellent results, however I have to admit the K-cups are more convenient.  I use the timer so the brewer is not on all night(nice feature). My Capresso made better coffee but I was unable to locate another. Overall I am very satisfied with the convenience, quality and cost of the brewer.

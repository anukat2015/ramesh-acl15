Title: Can't charge while playing
Content:
I purchased this product for my mother, who wanted to play the ipod on a Bose speaker system, which is the same as mine.  However, for some unfathomable reason, it was decided that this generation of ipod should not charge at the same time it's docked into a Bose system.  If this had been more explicitly spelled out, I would have made an alternative choice.  So, if you want this item just to take along with you - then it's great - but if you were expecting to be able to play and not have to recharge it along the way -then I would go with a different system.

I love this product and have used it at numerous functions. Pictures are excellent during the day.  Flash is average, had to purchase another flash unit for evening and night shots.  Do not try to use it if you are trying to take pictures of night football games. You need to change to many of the functions.
Problem!!!  Flash unit needed repair.  It just did not work after about 6 months.  It took 9 weeks for it to be returned to me.  I went through the store I purchased it from due to the warranty.  Check this out before you send the camera in for any type of repair.  Still having problems with the flash!  
OK.....here is another problem....the control panel is going on and off.  You are not capable of taking pictures when it acts up.  You have no display at all on certain settings.  This is a problem.  More problems as the camera gets more use.

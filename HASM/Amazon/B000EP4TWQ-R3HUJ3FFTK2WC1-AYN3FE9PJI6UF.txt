Title: good for what it does
Content:
I purchased this because everyone else seemed to be happy with theirs. It is solid, and has an nice interface. My problems with it are as follows - it has less features then nearly every other mp3 player on the market, and you can not change the battery with out having apple do it for you (it costs as much as the nano to have it replaced). Batteries only last a few years, so this item is really a consumable. If you dont care about the many features that most other players (of nearly the same size) have (radio, voic recording, etc..) and you dont care that it has a limited life then get it. The build quality, and interface are nice. 
Pros: well built, and nice interface
Cons lacks features, limited life

I've had it for a few months now, and it's taken alot of abuse. I've dropped it alot of times, once face-down into a 2-inch puddle of dirty water, and gotten it scratched up, yet it still works fine. It's very good. 4 GB is enough. Why would anyone need 40,000 songs??? Unless their downloading illegally... awww...

Title: Hoorah for Hoover
Content:
What a delight.  We have a platoon of vacs (Hoover-2, Electrolux, Panasonic-2, Sanitaire, Fathom) in the garage and not one works as well as this vac.  The Hoover description is an understatement.  I will not waste your time and restate the already stated.  
A couple of matters come forward, however.  The cord is 22' long; however, that is from the wall to the bottom of the canister.  You have to add the additional feet from the bottom of the canister to the end of the power nozzle to determine the actual effective feet.  With the wand fully extended I calculated the additional length to be about 11 feet.  When compared to a 29' Panasonic cord it is about the same.
The cup does fill fast if the floors are really dirty.  Our little 1600 sq ft abode fills about one half the cup on each floor cleaning.  When the cleaning is finished your are finished and do not have to worry about more dirt in the carpets.  They are clean.
The vac weighs 30 pounds.  That is a lot if it is all in one unit such as the 30 pound Hoover upright.  If it were not for the self-propelled feature of that machine one would successfully attain a full sized hernia.  This vac distributes its 30 pounds over the entire unit:  power nozzle, canister, cord, wands and hose.  With the relatively lightweight nozzle and large canister wheels you would never know this is a 30 pound vac.
Bottom line:  This is the best of the bunch.  One other comment.  Amazon has consistently demonstrated a superior attitude towards its customers and this purchase was no exception.  Even though other internet sellers had a cheaper price, we chose to use Amazon for its known super service.

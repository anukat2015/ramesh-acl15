Content:
I have had several Krups coffeemakers in the past few years and have generally been fairly pleased with their products. This most recent purchase of has not lived up to the previous purchases.
The first coffeemaker I received was defective in that the water did not flow through the channel. I contacted Ace (which you must do within three days of receipt of the product to receive a replacement) and received a label to return the item via UPS. It took the compmany another week to send a replacement. 
I have used this coffeemaker now for over one week. I do not like the fact that the timer comes on daily automatically. My previous coffeemaker required me to turn on the timer which I did when placing coffee in the system for the next day. It would also have been nice to have the light on the clock luminated at all times rather than only when the system is in use. Overall, If I were to purchase a new coffeemaker it is highly unlikely that I would select this type again.

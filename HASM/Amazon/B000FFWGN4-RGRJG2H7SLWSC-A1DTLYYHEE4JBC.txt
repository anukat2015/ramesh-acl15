Title: Not Satisfied  : (
Content:
We had a Hoover Windtunnel Bagless for 3-4 years that quit on us.  That seemed way to early so after researching we decided on the Bissell Lift-Off Revolution Pet Vac.  While the majority of reviews are great ours didn't work near as good as our old vacuum.  I would often run over the same item on the floor a couple of times before it would get picked up.  One big difference I really missed was being able to grab the hose adn edging tool while I was vacuuming and get into a corner and keep on going.  With the Bissell the best way was to go back and hit any places you couldn't get to which means going through your rooms twice.  We went back to the Hoover Windtunnel Bagless and are hoping for longer performance out of the new one.

Title: Best coffee maker I've had
Content:
I wasn't planning to buy a Cuisinart coffee maker, but after reading all the other reviews, I decided to try the DCC-1200BW. I love it! It's easy to use and looks great in my kitchen. Most importantly, it brews excellent coffee, whether I make 2 cups or 12 cups.

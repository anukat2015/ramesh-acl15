Title: geart coffee maker
Content:
My husband and I are very big coffee drinkers and have had just about every type of coffee maker there is.  This is one of the best we have ever owned. The design is perfect, very easy to clean and it is a foolproof design for making coffee. We owned the coffee station which often ended up with more coffee on the floor than in the carafe if you didn't place it straight into the machine.  This model is a dream and the red looks fantastic.

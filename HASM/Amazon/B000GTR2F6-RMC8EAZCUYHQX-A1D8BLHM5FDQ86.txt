Title: Stopped working properly after 1 week
Content:
I loved the machine itself but after approx one week it started to brew a 4 oz cup of copy using the 7.25 cup size. In addition, every other cup was luke warm at best. If it worked as it was intended I would recommend it highly but instead I am extremely dissappointed at the poor quality of the product.

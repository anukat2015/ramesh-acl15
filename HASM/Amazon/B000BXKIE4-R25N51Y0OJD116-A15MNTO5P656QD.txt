Title: Love It!
Content:
I have used a Kirby upright for years.  I decided to try this machine for a change of pace.  I LOVE IT!!  It cleans extremely well and is incredibly quiet.  I like the size and weight of it, and it is easy to use the accessories on my stairs.  The only draw-back is that when using the hand accessories, it is very easy to accidentally shut it off.  It would be nice if there was some sort of override button when using the hand accessories.  You get used to the canister style quickly and it is nice to be able to vacuum under beds and furniture without a big struggle.  I would recommend this machine.

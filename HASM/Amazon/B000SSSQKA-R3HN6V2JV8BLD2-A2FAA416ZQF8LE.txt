Title: Complete disappointment
Content:
I bought this vacuum, in part, because of the very positive reviews it had gotten, but having now tried two different machines I find those positive reviews a complete mystery.  The vacuum is fine on hard floors, though not exceptional.  On rugs, however, it is a complete disappointment.  On both piled area rugs and mat style rugs the powerhead was completely ineffective.  We have three cats, one of which pulls his hair out in clumps and the vacuum picked up almost none of the hair off the rugs, no matter how many times we went over it.  Our 10 yr old, battered Eureka canister works much better.  I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone, especially if you intend to use it on rugs.

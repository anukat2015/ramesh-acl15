Title: Nikon D90
Content:
After using film SLR's and point&shoot camera's for many years I decided to move up to a DSLR.  I have owned the D90 for 3 months now and so far it has worked great.  I found this camera very easy to understand.  All the controls are designed for ease of use.  Picture quality if super.  I process my pictures through photo shop elements and notice the D90 pictures need very little if any color or tone correction.  So for I am very satisfied with this purchase.

Title: ipod beater
Content:
Some people are giving reviews going on about how the ipod is so much better than this music/video player. Personnaly i think they are wrong. The colour variation is a very good idea and you do not have to spend more money on buying differnt colour skins for an ipod. I also think that it is good that you can use different kind of players to put your music on this player other than just itunes. Another thing is that i have known so many people whos ipods have broken and as another reviewer said the tech support is awful. I have this player and i have had no problems with it and i think it is great. Do not get drawn in by the hype of an ipod.

Title: Much talked about Apple usability not really here
Content:
I haven't seen this well described in other reviews, but you sort of rub the wheel to do certain things like change volume, etc.  I bought this as my second iPod (first was a 1G Shuffle) and I have to say the Shuffle was A LOT easier to figure out.  I actually had to read the directions to figure out how to go from one song to another and how to adjust the volume in the Nano!  The main reason I got this was for more storage and I wanted something that worked better with the Altec Lansing dock I got for x-mas.  Overall, does that just fine, however, some things like the cover flow, only display sideways, which doesn't work well with a dock.  I also haven' figured out how to access a lot of Nano functions with the Altec remote (I don't think you can).  So does some of what I want but has some usability quirks.

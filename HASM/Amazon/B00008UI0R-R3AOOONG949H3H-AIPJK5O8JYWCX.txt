Title: Its great for pet hair when it works
Content:
We have owned this product for about a year now. We found that it worked very well for pet hair and dirt. If it weren't for the following issues, it would have received 5 stars. The dirt cup is way too small and fills up after a couple of rooms. The power head is shorting out which means we will be looking for a new vacuum soon.

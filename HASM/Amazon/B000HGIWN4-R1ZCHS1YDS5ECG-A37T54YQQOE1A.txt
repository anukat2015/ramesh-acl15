Title: Weather sealing
Content:
there have been so many reviews of this camera that I doubt there is much I can add, except this...I have been an amateur photographer for nearly thirty years and about 10 years ago switched to Nikon film cameras. I have an F80 and an F90X, but my favourite is my F90X with MB10. I love the robustness of it. In February I purchased a Nikon D80 and just after bought an MBD80 for it. I was initially worried that it would not be the equal of my tough F90, however, last weekend, on the Monday public holiday I accidently left my D80 outside and it was rained on for two hours, quite heavy rain. I am immensely relieved to be able to say that the camera, though thoroughly wet on the outside, is fine. No water had penetrated the lens mount, the memory card hatch or the rubber boots which cover the connections on the side of the body. The top screen is fine and the rear screen is fine too. I had the sense not to turn it on and see if it was OK. I took the MBD80 off and the batteries out of it. I dried all the outside surfaces with tissue and let it sit in a warm room near a heater for that night and half the next day. When I put the batteries back in the MBD80 it fired up OK. I have read forums where people have said that the D80 weather sealing is not pro level, well, if people expect it to be better than this they should buy a Nikonos

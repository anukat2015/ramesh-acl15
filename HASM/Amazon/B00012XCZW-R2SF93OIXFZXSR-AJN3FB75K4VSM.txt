Title: Wonderful Product
Content:
This home coffee maker brews the absolute best coffee I've ever tasted at home.  I can't stand to buy coffee out because the coffee at home is so much better. I was a little confused with the water always staying hot hence the coffee maker is on all the time.  A few times my husband turned it off (vacation switch) and I didn't realize it which resulted in cold weak coffee.  Once we realized to leave it on all the time we have great tasting coffee every time.  I also bought a coffee grinder with this product for a full coffee experience.  I would recommend grinding your own beans along with this coffee maker.

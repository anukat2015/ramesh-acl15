Title: D80 review
Content:
I have owned the D50 for about a year, and after reading a report by Ken Rockwell I decided to upgrade.  One feature I opted for is the variable ISO setting.  It operates exactly as advertised and was worth the trade by itself.  The increase from 6 to 10 Mpixels alone is not worth the extra investment, but I love the camera and would do it again.  I use the 55mm to 200mm VR zoom with this body and it works!

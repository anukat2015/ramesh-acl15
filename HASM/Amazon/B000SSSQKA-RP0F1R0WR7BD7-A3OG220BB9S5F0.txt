Title: Great ergonomics and good balance of size and power
Content:
I have been using this product for 2 weeks and am delighted. The power is more than enough for small to medium jobs. The small size and weight makes it very easy to move around - you can pull it along on its big wheels or carry it by its handle. The ergonomics are excellent - there are several nice small touches, such as two slots to park the head in two positions. Quality construction and materials.
Yes, it's a bit noisy but not excessively so and I would guess normal for a compact yet powerful vacuum. Yes, the power cord is not as long as with a full-sized vacuum but I would not want to give up the small size for a few more feet of cable.

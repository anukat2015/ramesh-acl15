Title: Excellent camera meets professional needs.
Content:
I waited a long time before switching from a 35mm film SLR Canon camera to a digital. I asked many photographers, read online reviews, and browsed through many magazine articles. Then I spoke with Keith Lazelle, a superb nature photographer from Washington State, and he told me he switched from film to digital with an Olympus Evolt 500, because he was then able to use his other Olympus lenses with an adapter. I figured if it was good enough for such an excellent photographer, it would be good enough for me!  I have not been disappointed.
The Evolt 500 with its 2 lenses are more than enough for my needs. I love to take spontaneous shots of wildlife and waterways, and this camera has been an absolute delight. It took me a while on the learning curve for all the digital stuff (and I'm still learning), but overall it is very easy to use, and images turn out very sharp. 
I live in the Pacific Northwest and have been in the field photographing under plenty of rain and cold weather - and while I always have an extended hood on the lens to protect it from rain drops, I am not always successful in protecting the entire camera. I have never had any moisture/condensation problems.
I highly recommend this camera to anyone either beginning to use a digital SLR or to a professional.

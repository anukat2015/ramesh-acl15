Title: The Workhorse
Content:
What can I say that hasn't been already said.  If you are deciding which DSLR to get, and the D80 is in your options, GET THE D80!  Uncomparable to the D40, D40x and the new D60 in many ways.  Lens compatibility is the main reason why I purchased the D80.  I can switch/borrow lenses from my friends who own D100, D200, D70 and D300.  That alone helped me make my decision.  The D80 has a lot of the features that higher tier DSLR also has.  A very good buy!
April 2008 update:
Still love this DSLR. While I had the opportunity to upgrade to a D200 due to it's lowered value price, I kept the D80 because it's not that big of an upgrade IMO. I would only probably upgrade to a D300 or go full frame with a D3. I love that I am still learning the small nuances of this DSLR. D80 stand up!

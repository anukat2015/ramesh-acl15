Title: Dirt Devil Canister Vac
Content:
I'm very happy with my Dirt Devil! I have wood floors, carpeted floors, rugs and stairs in my home - all of which are easily cleaned with my Dirt Devil Canister Vac.  No more lugging the upright around and fighting to keep the rugs from getting damaged by the upright. I get the stairs cleaned up in a hurry now and getting the dog hair up from the wood floors is a breeze.  This canister vac is great anywhere in the house! Get the webs in the corners, freshen up the drapes, give the couch and chairs a good once over you name it!  Adjustable power at the handle, big wheels and no bags all go in to making this cleaner the perfect choice for most anyone.

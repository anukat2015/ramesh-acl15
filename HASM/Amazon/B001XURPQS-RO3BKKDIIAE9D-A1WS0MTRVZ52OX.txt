Title: An amazing camera for the money
Content:
This camera is simply amazing.  The lens is, well, usable until a good lens can be bought.  ISO's up to 3200 are surprisingly clean of noise.  I haven't tried the 6400 and 12800 settings yet.  Color is vibrant and real.  Controls are easy to use and conveniently located.  It replaced my 5 year old Rebel EOS 300D and frankly there is no comparison.  I usually shoot in RAW format and use a SanDisk 4 Gig card.  It's surprisingly fast.  The only disappointment is that the RAW files are not compatible with Photoshop.  They must be converted by the Canon EOS Utility program (included with the camera) before being able to open them in Photoshop.  This is a real production problem.  The conversion process is painfully slow - 100 photos can take the better part of an hour to complete the conversion (which is done automatically with the click of a button).  Other than that (which isn't really a reflection on the camera - just on Canon and Adobe), this is a great camera!  I recomend it to anyone not looking to buy the 5D Mk II.

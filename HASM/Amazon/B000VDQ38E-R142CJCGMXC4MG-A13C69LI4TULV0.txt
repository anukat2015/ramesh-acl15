Title: Best Bang-4-Buck
Content:
I have a short hair English bulldog who sheds contstantly. This vacuum does wonders! Only downside and reason for taking a star away was that the dirt tray gets filled up very quickly but if your vacuuming once a week it won't be too bad. Excellent suction and value.

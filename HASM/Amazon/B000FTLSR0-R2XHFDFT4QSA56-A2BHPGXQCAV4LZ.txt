Title: finally
Content:
Finally a semi-affordable digital slr.  One that I can use all of my Lenses and filters which have been sitting in storage.  I find it easy to use, easy to change between auto and manual focus, the photos look great (I am picky about this) and so far have had no problems.  My main complaint was that it did not come with a memory card. (nothing is more frustrating than having a new toy you can't try out because one of the main pieces is not included) The description and packaging should mention this so that an appropriate card can be ordered with the product. Fortunately I had one that would fit from my pda.

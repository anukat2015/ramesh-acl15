Title: piece of junk
Content:
Don't get me wrong - I love Mr Coffee pump espresso makers. I've had 2 ECMP10's and an ECMP40 - all wonderful and long-lived. I have had this for 2 weeks and it broke this morning - I turned it on to warm it up and water came gushing out from the inside. Time to find a different brand.

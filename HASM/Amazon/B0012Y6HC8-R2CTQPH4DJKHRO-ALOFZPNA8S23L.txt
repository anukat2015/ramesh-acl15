Title: Great camera, but buy body only
Content:
Great camera, but the kit lens is not very good. If you are new to SLR photography you will not be unhappy with it, it really is a huge leap from point and shoot, and you can use this lens to learn your camera. However if you have owned an SLR before and have used quality lenses you will be dissappointed. For more experienced buyers I suggest buying body only and invest in a good lens. A better lens will truly utilize this camera's capabilities.

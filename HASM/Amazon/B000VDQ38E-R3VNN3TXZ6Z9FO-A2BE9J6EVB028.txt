Title: Dirty! Hate it!  Do NOT buy!  No Stars!
Content:
This is the worst vacuum ever.  It is dirty.  Dust flys all over when you use it!  The dirt bin is hard to empty, fur gets stuck in the top portion and you have to reach in and pull it out.  What a mess.  The attachments do not stay attached.  The beater brush does not turn all the time.  I complained and they told me to take it apart and make sure it wasn't clogged.  I am just so handy, I love to take apart vacuum cleaners when they are new.  :-)  Stay away from this model.  I purchased a wonderful clean Hoover.

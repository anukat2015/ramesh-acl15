Title: Only had one problem
Content:
I love my iPod Nano.  It plays all my music and have had no problem with the music and photo portions.  
The only problem I have is getting it to stop when I am searching for a song, photo, etc.  I rented a movie from iTunes to watch on a flight I was going to take.  When I tried to access the movie somehow it had 2 choices....Delete or Cancel...........tried to get it on the cancel tab and Pfft, the movie was deleted..........Maybe it's just me and I need a little more practice.  Otherwise, I have no problem with it.

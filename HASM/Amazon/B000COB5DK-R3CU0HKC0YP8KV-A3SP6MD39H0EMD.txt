Title: avoid this or repairmaster warranty
Content:
the cost of the warranty is 1/4 the price of a new laptop.  It took 7 months to get service through a similar group, warrantech and repairmaster, and they only wanted to service it after we had reinstalled the operating system.  For a laptop which had problems with a faulty fan they wanted an operating system reinstall!

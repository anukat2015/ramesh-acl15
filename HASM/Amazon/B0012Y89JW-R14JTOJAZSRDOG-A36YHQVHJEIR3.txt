Title: The best entry level cam on the market, period!
Content:
If it only had built in IS, it would be the perfect cam.  Canon has to continue successfully producing/selling their IS lenses so having cameras with built in shake reduction feature is pointless for them unless they want to hurt their sales.  Then again, at some point, they will be the only manufacturer to have no built in IS and if people enjoy using manual lenses, they will want to have their Canon cameras with built in IS just for the sake of using older Canon lenses and the rest available for what is the most versatile mount for use of any older manual focus lenses from Contax to Leica.
XSI is a wonderful camera, bettered perhaps by the slightly nicer sensor of the 40D, but worth the price to pay for the 40D?...not sure.

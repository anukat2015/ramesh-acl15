Title: Good Deal
Content:
I bought this on "Black Friday" but missed out on the $197 deal. I got it for $299, But still, I think I got a good deal. Amazon shipped it in 3 days and during the mean time, I read reviews where people said there wasn't any webcam. I've never had one and even though that would have been a great plus, I'm still happy with the computer. Hd quality screen, Windows 7 os, numeric keyboard. I was up and running in about an hour after copying my files from my external hd. I'm happy. I'm in school and keep most of my work work on a flash drive, so the size of the hd doesn't bother me to much.

Title: Well worth the money...
Content:
This vacuum is well worth the money.  I bought a Dyson a couple of weeks ago, and didn't like it at all.  I returned it and bought this one after reviewing.  I am overall very happy with this vacuum. I really only had the Dyson to compare it to (always had cheap vacuums), so I am comparing them below. 
Pros: 
Cord foot thing - Dyson did not have this
Easy to use controls at your fingertips - Dyson you had to reach to floor to change.
Very powerful - Much more so than the $470 Dyson
Headlight - Dyson did not have this
Lightweight - Dyson very heavy
Reaches all the way under a King size bed - Dyson could not
Great Price - Dyson was not!
      
Cons:  
Dirt cup way to small - Dyson was not
Feels kind of flimsy, like it won't last that long
The upholstery brush cannot be stored in the canister

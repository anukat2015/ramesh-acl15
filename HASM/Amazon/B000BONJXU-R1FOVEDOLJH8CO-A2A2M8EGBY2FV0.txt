Title: great mp3 player!!
Content:
there are so many mp3 players on the market now. when i first started with mp3 players, i got a rca brand player. was horrible. then i searched online for a drag and drop mp3 player, by that i mean, you don't have to install annoying software that comes with the mp3 player to add the music. i havent and never will like itunes or any other so called "music management" software. i want to be able to drag and drop my music to my player just like its a usb pen drive. 
that's where this unit comes in. the interface is easy to use windows xp home  automatically finds it, so you don't even have to install a driver!
the battery life is decent, however if you use this unit for several hours a day, you may want to invest in some NIMH rechargeable batteries. these things will save your wallett! any electronic device nowadays is going to kill batteries. so pick you up some rechargeable AAA nimh batteries and never run out of power again!
the earbuds that come with this unit could be better, however the sound quality is decent, and i don't wanna spend $200.00+ on Noise canceling earphones. 
this unit also comes with intergrated fm tuner and voice recorder.
i currently have about 110 mp3 songs on it, and you can fit more if you put wma's on it.
overall great value for the money. way to go sandisk!!!

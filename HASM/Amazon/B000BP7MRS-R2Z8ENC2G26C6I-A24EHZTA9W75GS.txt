Title: Great value, easy to use
Content:
This is a great coffee maker at any price.  Easy to operate - I had it set up in less than five minutes.  We ignored the instructions on the water filter since we use bottled water, and we're quite happy with the quality of the coffee.  Stand and carafe keep the coffee hot, not just warm.  Finally, it uses less coffee than our previous coffee maker - we grind our own and had to cut the amount we use in half.  This is a great deal.

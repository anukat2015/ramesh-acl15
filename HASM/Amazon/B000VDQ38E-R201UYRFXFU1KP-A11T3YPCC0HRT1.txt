Title: Adding on previous review of product..our broke in a month
Content:
I wrote a glowing review of ths product when I first purchased it as it did do a great a job. I am revising the last review however because it broke within a month of receipt. It was just past the return date too..figures. The machine just suddenly stopped picking up the hair. My parents now have Dyson Animal that they got on clearance at Walmart fot $250 and it is absolutely terrific. We have had it for six months now and not a problem at all. I wish the bissell was better..none of our bissell products have had a long life span in our household staring to wonder if they are as good as they used to be...

Title: Great Product
Content:
The iPod Classic 80Gb is probably the best product regarding MP3 players Apple currently has. It is stable and it has proved to be a good device. Although iTunes is not good enought (slow, heavy and buggy) the device itself is pretty good. Just remember...DON'T DROP IT !!!!

Title: waiting to be impressed
Content:
I bought this vacuum expecting to be wowed but I sent it back waiting to be impressed.   Ditto on so many of the reviews with the pros and cons.   I am particular about vacuum cleaners.  The suction on this machine is listed as 220 air watts which I would like to comment is equal to the suction on my Eureka which has 12 amps.   If you're looking for a good cleaner you might consider the Eureka 48070MZ.   Electrolux manufactures Eurekas.   They work very well and have been greatly improved and the cost is a fraction of Dyson.

Title: Extraordinary machine
Content:
A compaq Evo N610c notebook came into my possession in 2008, when it was 5 or 6 years old, and I already had another computer as my daily driver. I spent a couple bucks to get the W200 wireless module and a ram upgrade, gave it an old hard disk I had lying around, and if I didn't already have a newer laptop, I would just use the Evo. It has unbelievable battery life, a brilliant screen capable of 1400 by 1050 resolution, very useful shortcut keys and buttons, and countless other features. I truly believe it was designed better than my newer laptop... The hinge isn't too stiff or too loose, it has very easy access to ram, HDD, and the multibay, etc. I would recommend this laptop to anyone, and with XP pro, 1.25g of ram, and integrated wireless, it is just as capable in today's business world as it was in 2002.

Title: wake up and smell.....
Content:
Expensive. Does everything the description says, but I was expecting something above the average maker for the price. The lid on the carafe does not remove easily. There is a lot more plastic where I thought would be stainless steel. Need to consider height space because it is tall. All that being said, it does brew coffee.;-)

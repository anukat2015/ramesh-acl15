Title: service sucks
Content:
While the computer is nice and sleek, be careful if you need service. The computer was less than 40 days old when it broke. After 5 hours on the phone, and a week of down time, a technician came to the house (we have extended in home warranty which we pay for - not cheap). Guess what, still broken. Another 5 hours on the phone, and now another week of waiting. Interestingly Dell offers a warrenty which guarentees you speak to someone in North America! We even paid for that. Still got bad service. It is very telling that there is no phone number or address available to file a complaint. Believe me I tried everything. Finally Customer Service said they had not mechanism to file complaints in the company. Buyer beware. Great computer if it works but if it doesn't looks like we are out of luck.

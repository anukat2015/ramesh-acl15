Title: Best Vacuum I Have Ever Owned
Content:
I bought my Electrolux EL6988D in 2005 and I love it.  Without a doubt the best vacuum I have ever owned.  It is quiet yet very powerful and one of the few that cleans fabric, wood floors and carpet exceptionally well.  I use it weekly and no parts have broken or failed.  It is very well built and makes vacuuming as fun as it can be.  I recommend it VERY highly!

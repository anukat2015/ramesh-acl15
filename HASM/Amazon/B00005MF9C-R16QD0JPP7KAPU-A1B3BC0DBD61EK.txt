Content:
I have had two of the black and decker cup of coffee maker before and loved then.  This is my third one I have purchased and this one of of very poor quality.  The two I had before were of thicker plastic, this one is very  thin  plastic and I feel I will break it when I used it.  I am not at all pleased and do not suggest you buy it .

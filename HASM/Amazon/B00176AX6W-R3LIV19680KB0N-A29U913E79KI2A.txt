To be honest.....when I purchased this I didn't know what to expect, but i'm glad that i did. I love the look and the ease I was able to use the functions but two things, I felt as though they should have had a feature whereby u can lock the folders internally and it needed an equalizer (even though the sound is not too bad). Overall I think it's better than the Ipod.......P.S. Microsoft should take a look at the software to allow a faster sync!!!!!!!

Title: Great
Content:
This is a great vacuum.  I'd bought a much cheaper one and finally bit the bullet.  I'm glad I did.  Why?
First, a vacuum cleaner needs to make a good vacuum.  This one does.  
Second, a vacuum cleaner needs to be handy.  This one is
Third, a vacuum cleaner needs to be hassle free.  This one is.
It's light and all the controls are in three pushbuttons on the handle.  Make the brush spin or not, step the suction power through three levels, turn it on or off.  The canister is light enough I carry it with me upstairs as I do the stairs.  By the way - it comes with a small attachment with a brush powered by suction.  Works great on the stairs where the main head is too big.  The main head brush is powerful and turns off at a button push when passing from carpet to wood or tile.  Suction is adjustable so if a throw rug is caught, just reduce the suction.  And when you're all done, don't worry about winding up the cord - step on the pedal and it disappears into the machine.
It does everything it's supposed to and does it nicely.  It's not cheap - but I spent half as much on a cleaner that wouldn't do nearly what this one does and was both heavy and incnvenient to boot.

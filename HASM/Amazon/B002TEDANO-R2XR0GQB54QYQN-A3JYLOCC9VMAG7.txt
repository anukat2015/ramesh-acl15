Title: A better "netbook"
Content:
Having used a dell mini 9 since first released, and relying on my netbook with all my travel, I had fallen in love with the Mini 9's battery life.  Wear and tear took out that machine, but looking for a replacement I saw the 1810 and was piqued.  However, I had reservations about battery life and weight given the larger size, faster processor, and real hard drive.  However, I would say my battery life has been better, and the weight differential is negligable.  The power supply has a small brick, but not bad - I still liked the built in PS on the mini 9.  All in all I am very pleased, and get consistent 6+ hrs of battery use (offline email, editing in word, working in eclipse, periodic video).
Other nice this is the laptop doesn't get unreasonably hot, but be sure to respect the vents, otherwise it overheats like older laptops with corrupted screen and input.

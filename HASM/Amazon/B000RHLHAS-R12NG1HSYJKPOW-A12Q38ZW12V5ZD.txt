Title: Sureset Digital Ceramic Heater - HZ341 BL
Content:
The heater works well and was a good value. Be sure to read the directions to set up the timer and temperature properly. This will ensure the unit will work the way you want it to. I had to re-read because I had mistakenly set it for continuous running instead of temperature and timer controlled. Also, it does return to the default settings everytime it is turned on (maybe to make sure you safely set it). It will run up to 10 hours on the timer setting. I have not tried the remote control yet.

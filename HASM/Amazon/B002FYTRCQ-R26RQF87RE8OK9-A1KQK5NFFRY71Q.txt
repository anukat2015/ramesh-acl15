Title: Great lightweight, portable vaccuum!
Content:
I absolutely love this vacuum! It is exactly what I was looking for. It's lightweight, powerful, and has variable settings and several tools. And, unlike other vacuums, once you put the tools on, it does not lose suction power. It's almost too strong! It will suck up anything in its path.
Great for hardwood floors and area rugs. I had been sweeping and using a dust mop on my floors for months, because I didn't have the right vacuum. I bought this and made a run around the entire house in an hour, including the kitchen and bathroom. So nice to know there are no dust bunnies hiding under the bed or the dresser anymore, and my rugs look brand new.
I love the retractable cord. I highly recommend this little vacuum cleaner.

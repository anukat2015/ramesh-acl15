Title: does everything it says it does
Content:
I did alot of research on small, efficient and affordable vacs, and this one is great, for me.  I have all tile and hardwood floors, a sportsguy, and dog who sheds alot - does a very good job of vacuuming.  It isn't heavy at all, and has great suction!

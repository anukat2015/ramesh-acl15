Title: This is My Favorite Vacuum!!!
Content:
I clean houses for a living. I deal with all sorts of vacuums. I use this one in my home, along with a Hoover Fold Away.
This Dirt Devil has powerful suction, a nice range of tools, a place to put a scented filter in addition to the HEPA.
Also, the red one looks like a race car. The dual canister/dust bin has 2 spinning silver parts. It not only looks cool, but works great.
I prefer is over a Dyson, as many homes I clean have them, this DOES work better. 
The cord is more than long enough and is great on stairs.
I only gave 4 instead of 5 because the hose, on occasion, can clog. But that is the only problem.

Title: nice and warm
Content:
Got this little heater to supplement our central heating, along with another ceramic heater and a water filled radiator. The radiator will heat a large area, but this little guy makes you feel warm instantly--much better, in my opinion. Not silent, but not crazy loud--about as loud as a fan. I've used it to great effect in my high ceilinged living room, and very efficiently in my low ceilinged tv room. I'm thinking of another one for the bathroom.

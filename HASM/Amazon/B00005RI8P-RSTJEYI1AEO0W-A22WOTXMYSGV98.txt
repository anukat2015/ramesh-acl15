Title: So Happy, bought 2!
Content:
I own the new 14.1" 2002 iBook, and these computers are awesome.  OS X aquaface is absolutely stunning, and all the new products for OS X such as Microsoft X, Acrobat 5, are 10 X better to look at than their predacesors of OS 9.  I can't wait for Photoshop in OS X!  The speed with the preinstalled 256MB Ram is a little too slow for my taste, but after installing a 512MB/PC-133 dimm to bump me up to 640MB, I am cruzing at lightening speeds. Even Mac haters have admitted to me being enchanted by the outer and inner appearance of the glamorous icebook.  Oh, the second one purchased is my husbands (a die hard Windows user)! Ha!

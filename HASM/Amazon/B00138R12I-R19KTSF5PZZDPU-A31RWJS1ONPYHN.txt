Title: Expected more than what I found
Content:
I have been using various sony cameras right from P9, P10, some fancy handy types which came out as limited editions and lately using DSC-H1 past 2 years now. I decided to buy a new series alpha of sony and is when I finalized the A300 and bought. The contrast, clarity, liveliness on the true colours is all that is lacking in A300. My DSC-H1 is excellent comparing to A300. The pictures from A300 look as if somebody has set an extra film of colour which ruins the results and photos look like they have been stored for many years. I am talking of clicking the photos in either "P" mode or "Auto" mode. So not as expected. Otherwise, the look of the camera, price, some extra features are not matcahable with other brands. Sony stays quiet exclusive in those terms.

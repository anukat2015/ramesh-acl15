Title: Great Space Heater for the Price
Content:
Like others, we have a finished basement that stays chilly, and I wanted something that wasn't loud, too expensive, or too large.  This seemed to be perfect, especially since it came highly-rated here on Amazon.
PROS:
- Size; it takes up about as much floor space as an umbrella stand or coat rack, or one of the torchier-style lamps.
- Noise; you know it's on, but it's not obtrusive.  I only have to up the TV volume a couple more notches.
- Remote; it has all (or most) controls, and the instructions and icons are easy to decipher.
- Heat; at the highest setting it puts out enough heat to keep a person toasty who's right next to it, while still being able to do the whole room.
- Features; oscillation, room temperature control (set the heater at 72, and it turns itself on if the room temp dips below that), 1hr to 8hr timer.
CONS:
- It takes about 5-6 hours to heat the basement space I need done (I think the room is about 14 by 24). Not really a "con", because it can only do much, I think I may have expected to much, maybe 2-3 hours.
- It should be about 6-8 inches taller, but again it may not really be a "con", just a preference.
I highly recommend this heater; it's priced right, and any room that's smaller than the room I mentioned above should reap the benefits.

Title: Apple iPod Shuffle Rocks
Content:
The technology is amazing.  The tiny Apple iPod shuffle holds 240 songs - more or less, depending on the length of the tune.  Music can be downloaded quickly and easily from the iTunes store or directly from your own CD collection to your computer and then to the unit.  It's light, durable and never skips like the old portable CD players, even if you're running.  The sound quality is excellant - no need to purchase pricey additional earphones.  With the iPod Shuffle, you can listen to all your favorite songs - and ONLY your favorite songs - while working out, doing errands or travelling.  The unit clips securely to any article of clothing which is a great plus over the iPod Nano.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone of any age.  Both of my children (ages 7 & 12) have one and now my husband wants one, too!  If you just want the music (without video options) this is the way to go.  For people like me who came of age during the years of the Walkman, this unit is nothing short of amazing.

Title: Sooo Nice!
Content:
I purchased my macbook pro in March 2010 and have been glued to it ever since!  I had been using a pc for the last 10 years and kept going through them year after year so finally, after way to many trips to see the Geek Squad to fix my pc's I switched to a Mac. I am no computer expert at all and just use the computer to take online classes and surf the web.  Nothing fancy.  I was still able to work my way around the Mac and figure things out.  It's not hard to use for a Non expert like myself. I am now taking one to one classes now at the apple store and they really help you realize the things this computer is capable of.  I really like what you can do with your pictures and how you can connect the computer with your iphone and organize your life.  My 3 year old watches movies and tv shows I've downloaded on this Mac and he knows exactly how to get to the movies.  I only showed him a couple of times and he knows what to do.  The keyboard is lit up so you can see what you are typing even when it's dark.  It's very easy to find things if you're still learning the Mac like I am.  I don't worry that I will misplace something.  You just type what you're looking for into this one little area called FINDER and it finds it for you.  I expect not to buy another computer for a very long time.  My friend has a MacBook and hers is still kicking after 5 years, no problems at all! That's what I am hoping for too!

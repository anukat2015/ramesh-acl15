Title: Rebel XTi - smooth conversion from film to digital
Content:
As a long-time user of Canon film 35mm cameras, I've been putting off moving to digital.  This camera makes me wish I'd made the move years ago.  Excellent quality photos, easy to get started but still lots of features.  And, most important, compatible with existing lenses.

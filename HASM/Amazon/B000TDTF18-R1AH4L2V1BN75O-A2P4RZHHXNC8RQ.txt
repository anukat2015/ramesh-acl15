Title: Awesome front loading design easy to use programmable coffee maker
Content:
Simply put this thing is awesome.  The "Convenient Front Access" front loading feature is great, no more moving the coffee maker to load water and grounds. The filter that comes with it is excellent, it works well and it is easy to clean.  The programmable interface for a nicely timed pot of coffee in the morning is very easy to use.  Much easier to use than other programmable coffee makers I have used. I also found the aroma feature quite nice and effective....  Highly recommended.

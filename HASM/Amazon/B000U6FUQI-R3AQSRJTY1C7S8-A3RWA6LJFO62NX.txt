Title: Ok -- could have more power.
Content:
I found this on clearance and yes it does look cool.  But dog hair fills it up almost instantly and crevices in tile make it hard for this to do a good job -- it really just needs more power.  Good only on the floor, but for a quick sweep its not awful.

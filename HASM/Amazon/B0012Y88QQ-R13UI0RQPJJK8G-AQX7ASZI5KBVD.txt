Title: Great camera. Real good for beginners!!!
Content:
Only had the camera for a few days, but have taken around 200 shots. I must first say this review if from a true beginner. Very easy, navigating the menu and changing settings is pretty easy. My photo's came out even better than I was expecting. I'm only using the kit lens for now. Will purchase 55-250mm on Monday.

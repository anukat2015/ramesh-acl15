Title: great back saver!
Content:
When the old canister was doing in the back of the person using it, i searched the web and found reviews from seniors that specifically states that this was a kinder product, so i ordered it.  it is great...it's easy to use, easy on the back, picks up well.  My house has no thick carpets, so it's perfect for me.  I'd highly recommend this product.

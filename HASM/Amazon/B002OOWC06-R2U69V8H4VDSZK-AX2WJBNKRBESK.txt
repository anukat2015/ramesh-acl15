Title: I hope you don't need to have it repaired
Content:
We bought this product through Amazon in November, 2009.  It showed up a few days before Thanksgiving.  I got it all set up for my wife with all software installed and ready to go.  It worked for exactly 7 days and then the embedded wireless adapter stopped working.  The device disappeared from the system.  On November 27th, I called Toshiba and, of course, they told me to reinstall Windows.  I said 'The wireless device is GONE, Windows doesn't even detect it any more'.  She said 'OK, do you want to return it for repair?'.  I said yes and two days later received a box to send in the unit.  The unit went in for repair on 12/2, they acknowledged receipt on 12/7 (even though it was 2-day shipping!) and shortly afterward, the status showed 'on hold for parts'.  Well, as of today, 12/16, it is still in the same status.  When I originally asked how long it would take to repair the unit, I was told 10 days.  Well, today is the 10th day and no progress since the 9th.  I called to ask when I can expect to get the machine back and I was put on hold for over an hour.  Eventually, they DROPPED my call.  My advice to you is don't buy Toshiba.  The hardware failed almost immediately, the repair depot is slow to acknowledge receipt, and the product is obviously poorly made or they would not have such a long wait for parts and in their phone queue.  I WISH I HAD NOT BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT!  I ADVISE YOU TO LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE.

Title: Good heater for the price
Content:
I use this heater in my cold basement under my computer desk, and I'm pretty happy with it.  I was worried about the noise because I use a lot of speech-recognition software and a noisy fan doesn't help accuracy.  It's not as quiet as I had hoped, but it's not bad, and my SR software doesn't seem to be affected.  Negatives:  Only one fan speed; it could use at least two.  Also, the numbers on the thermostat and heat control dials are hard to read - not a big deal, since it's also very simple.  The 750 watt setting doesn't put out a lot of heat, so I mostly use the 1500 watts.  On the plus side, it seems to be very safe, the thermostat cycles just fine so it holds the desired temperature pretty well, it's nice looking, and hey, it's cheap!  You can't really go wrong for 15 bucks.

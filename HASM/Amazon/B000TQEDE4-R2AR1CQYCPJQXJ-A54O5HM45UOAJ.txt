Title: Expensive junk
Content:
After having the coffee marker for a little while, the mechanism for controlling the no drip feature when the carafe was out of the coffee maker would malfunction causing coffee to leak all over my kitchen even when the carafe was inside the coffee machine.  A large mess in your kitchen is not the best way to start your day!

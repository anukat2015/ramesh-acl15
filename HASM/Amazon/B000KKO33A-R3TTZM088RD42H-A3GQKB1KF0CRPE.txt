Title: great for emergencies
Content:
With deep winter upon us, these are great alternative heaters for people on electric heat.  They provide 23,000 BTU - more than enough to heat 2-3 easily.  VERY hot.  Foutchie loves to roast her fur next to it.  Runs for about 12 hours, a little longer if you cut it back.  Easy refill, good protective guard.  I have paid $50 more for ones not as high quality.
I have had this brand before and they are long lasting.

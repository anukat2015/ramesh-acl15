Title: A great product for the price
Content:
After doing much research on Laptops, My son and I decided on Toshiba. As a high school student his need for certain applications were very important to him, but the need for these applications and price were very important to me. 
Some highlights: Great sound and Graphics, smooth to the touch , Sleek look and love the face recoginition security. These are just a few of the many things my son enjoys. It was definitely worth the investment..

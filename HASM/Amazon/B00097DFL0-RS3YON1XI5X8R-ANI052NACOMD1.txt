Title: We bought 2!
Content:
Last summer was the most humid in San Diego, CA I have ever experience in the 16 years I've lived here. My husband was working nights at the time and complained the heat was making it unbearable to sleep during the day. Our home is over 2,200 SF so running the air conditioner is NOT cost effective when there are only 2 people at home occupying 2 rooms in the entire house. I ordered this unit after doing extensive online research on several products. We did have to rig it on a couple of stepstools in order to get a larger collection bin for the water but it was only necessary for a few (extremely humid) days. The unit helped to reduce the temps in our 200 SF bedroom up to 7 degrees. But the biggest benefit was drying up the air enough to make sitting still (and sleeping) more comfortable. The unit is so effective we ordered another one to keep downstairs; it's toooooo heavy to lug up and down the stairs. The noise is insignificant since we fall asleep with the TV on and my only complaint would be set-up. It took us about 40 minutes to put it all together and configure the vent to the window. Of course, trying to set up while sweating your butt off creates more frustration. Love the remote, timer and wheels!

Title: FINALLY!  a Multiple Exposure DSLR- The Nikon D80
Content:
Years ago, I had been shooting with SLR cameras for a long time, using my old Canon AE1 for scenics and portraits. In those days there were no way to do multiple exposures in the camera, only in the darkroom. But then Canon came out with the (black)Canon A1 with it's multiple exposures control 'slip' lever and I was in heaven!! 
But, That was 'a long time ago...in a galaxy far,far away.
Since the arrival of the DSLR, I could not find a multiple exposures digicam. So, I settle for photoshop software to do it. BUT now that's changed. Nikon is truely a smart company. FINALLY! a Multiple Exposure DSLR-The Nikon D80 10.2MP has arrived. Man that's GREAT!!! a DSLR that can do IN CAMERA multiples. I'm in heaven again. These shots are amazing!! 
With all the great features and Multiple Exposure too, that alone would cause me to buy this camera.
Portraits here I come!!!

Title: Love the Vornado Vortex Heaters
Content:
I live in an old house built at the turn of last century.  The vornados do exactly what they say they do.  By placing them strategically in cooler areas of the house they even out the temperature of the rooms and I love them.  We have three now.  One I've been using for three years.  One has arrived and is a bit noisy, I should point out that the others are rather quiet and constant.  I've also noticed that my overall expense on electric and fuel oil is lower now that I'm not using the ceramic heaters.  I highly recommend these heaters if you are looking to even the temperature of your drafty old house with cold spots!

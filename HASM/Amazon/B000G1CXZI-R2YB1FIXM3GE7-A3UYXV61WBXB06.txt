Title: works, just a tad bit noisy
Content:
works well, puts out good heat and doesnt get too hot for kids touching it with the larger surface area of the fins.  only problem is on med or high, the heating element creaks as the metal in the unit expands and contracts while the element turns on and then turns off. whatever metal they used in there, it changes size to easily with temperature so in themiddle of the night, click... tick tick tick tick tick as the element heats up, then click, element goes off and tick tick tick... as the element cools down.  the larger version of this didnt have the problem, you cant tell, hardly, when the heater is switching on and off, you just get nice heat coming off it.

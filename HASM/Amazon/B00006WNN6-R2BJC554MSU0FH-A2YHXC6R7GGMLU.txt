Title: No off/on button. Must unplug to turn off.
Content:
What I don't like about this heater/fan:
1-There is no off/on button.  
2-The red light stays on whenever the fan/heater is plugged in - so even when the heater isn't "on" it still has a bright red light that looks like it needs to be turned off, but there is no off button - you have to unplug it.
3-The two dials on the top of the fan/heater are not marked well and are not intuitive.

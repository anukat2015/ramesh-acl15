Title: I'm a gamer, and this laptop...
Content:
So i bought this laptop primarily for games, and i'm glad i did. Its great, and runs WoW fine (dalaran lags like crazy.) I also bought Modern Warfare 2 for it, because a review said it would work great. This is false. If the computer is cool, then you can get a few good minutes, but then the fps goes to like 2. 
All these specs are out of the box, i don't have a new video card or anything. The battery is TERRIBLE, and i only get 4 hours at most.

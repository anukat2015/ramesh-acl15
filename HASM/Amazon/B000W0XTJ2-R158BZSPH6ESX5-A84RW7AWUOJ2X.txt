Title: It's going to stop working in a year or so, Don't buy it
Content:
It's nice to have a touch screen display, it's also nice that the screen swivels, but that's it.
The laptop is very heavy to it's small size, and it gets incredibly hot when is in use, I guess this is the reason why it stops working in most cases (I had one, but 2 friends of mine with the same model, had the same problems) the wifi adaptor fries in a couple of months, and then comes the motherboard, at 8-14 months
I reccomend not to buy this laptop

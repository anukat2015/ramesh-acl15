Title: Is great so far
Content:
I bought this for my office. It's a sturdy and powerful little guy. I've only had it a few weeks but I've already tripped over the cord and it still works. I tend to mistreat appliances and this thing is still working. Pretty amazing, actually. I think it's a good product.

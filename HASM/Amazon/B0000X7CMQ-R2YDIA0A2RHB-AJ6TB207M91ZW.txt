Title: Not so hot
Content:
I bought the Zojirushi thermal coffee maker with high hopes after reading the many glowing reviews of this product.  After using it for about a week I can say that I am less than delighted with it.  Admittedly, it makes good coffee, but the stainless steel thermal carafe is poorly designed.  The worst part of it is that the carafe does not keep coffee hot.  The Krups model which I previously owned had a glass vacuum bottle liner which kept coffee hot for hours.  The Zojirushi allows the coffee to cool very quickly.  The escaping heat can be felt by placing your hand on the outside of the carafe.  Furthermore, the top of the carafe is difficult to open and close.  Other reasons for my downgrade:  it is slow, it is noisy.

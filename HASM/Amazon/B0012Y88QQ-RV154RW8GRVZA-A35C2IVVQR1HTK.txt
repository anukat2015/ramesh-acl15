Title: Absolutely Thrilled!
Content:
This is a remarkable camera.  I took my first photography course in 1984.  I used my uncle's Nikon, and was hooked.  This cheap little SLR does everything I could ever have wanted in an SLR.  Sure it's APS-C, but the pics look great and on my budget - it's a top notch camera.  I recommend adding the el-cheapo 50mm 1.8 lens that canon sells for 100 bucks.  It's worth it unless you can shell out some more for a wider/faster lens (I'm saving up for a 30mm 1.4).  If you come from the old world of 35mm film SLRs you'll want to multiply the lens length by 1.6 with this camera - so a 50mm lens is actually a fair bit longer.  You'll want 35mm or 30mm to get that old SLR prime lens feel (just like 1984).  Do some research and you'll hear all sorts of complaining from the "full frame" snobs.  For the world of us average joe amature photographer this camera is outstanding - don't worry about full frame.  As too the longevity of the "S" lenses - just don't sink alot of money into them (which is not a problem because they are pretty cheap).  If you want a really expensive lens - it'll undoubtably be full frame anyway (which will work just fine with this camera).
Great buy.  Great camera.  Nothing but positive things from me on this one!

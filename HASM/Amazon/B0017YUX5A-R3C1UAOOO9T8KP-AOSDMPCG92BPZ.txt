Title: hoover s3670 windtunnel bagged
Content:
this is a very mobile, conveniently made vacuum. the suction power is good, especially on FLAT bare floors, the rotating brush cleans carpet and rugs thoroughly, and the adjustable arm is great. i wish the suction was a bit stronger and that the vacuum felt a bit more indestructible and had a bit more heft in the arm as it tends to pull it's self off the ground with suction. i have been through three vacuums in the past three years and am pretty hard on them. so far this is the one i am happiest with and i do recommend it.

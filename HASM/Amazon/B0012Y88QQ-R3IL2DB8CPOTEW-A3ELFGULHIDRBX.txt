Title: My first "real" camera
Content:
This is my first digital SLR, and I have immensely enjoyed thus far.  I bought this one because the price was palatable, and it had been recommended to me by several friends.  I have not been disappointed.   I am learning a lot about photography in general right now, and I feel that this is a great camera to learn on.

Title: Useless attachments
Content:
Just received this vacuum and wonder why they designed the small corner/duster the way they did.  Because it is so bulky, it won't fit into corners - which makes it useless to me.  And because it's black it leaves marks on walls.  I will be using an old attachment from my white handheld oreck instead.  Suction is ok, but we purchased it primarily for corners, spiderwebs, crevice cleanup, so small attachments are a big dissappointment.

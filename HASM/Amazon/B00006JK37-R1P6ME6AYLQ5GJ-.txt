Title: D100 PRODUCES INCREDIBLE DETAIL IN PHOTOS
Content:
I don't know why the reviewer says that this camera is not professional because he can't use it in broadcast tv, etc.  You should always make sure you're getting the right camera for a given purpose.  Plus, I have both the D1X, and this D100.  I use the D100 as back-up and as a first line camera from time to time.  I find that the images produced by each camera have superb detail and contrast; and I find that using the same lens, side by side photos taken by both, make it difficult to determine which camera they came from.  Being 100% candid, the D1X does produce some of the best images I've seen, but the D100 is no slouch and I dare you to find noticeable noise, unlike smaller cameras with a lot of megapixels.  If you like to take pictures of Uncle Charley's wedding, or a photo to enter a contest, or even to manipulate with one of the photo editors, I believe you'll find the D100 an incredible bargain.

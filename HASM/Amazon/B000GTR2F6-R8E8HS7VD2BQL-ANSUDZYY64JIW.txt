Title: Best Coffee Maker Ever!
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker at the end of last year, and let me tell you, I've never been happier.  I LOVE coffee, and if you do too, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this machine.  Once you find a flavor and/or strength of coffee you love, you're addicted.  I've bragged about this machine (B70), over and over again to friends and family, that some have actually gone out and bought one after testing it out at my house.  You won't be sorry.  (One side note however.  I've purchased the reusable k-cup that you put your own coffee in, and it just doesn't taste right at all.  I'm not sure why, but I don't use that feature anymore.  I am strickly a k-cup purchaser.  I have the spinning carosel, and it's not only convenient in holding the k-cups, but it looks fabulous next to my coffee maker.  I've even gone out and bought all new beautiful glass coffee mugs to use and put on display with it.)  It's just one of THE BEST purchases of small appliances I've ever made.

Title: compact and simple
Content:
This is actually my second MP3 player.  The first was a piece of junk.  The shuffle is small and simple to use.  I had it playing songs in less than 30 minutes after I got some of my music downloaded to my computer.  I am not one of the types that has to see what is playing.  I put my shuffle on when I start my workout, push play, lock the keys, and continue with my workout.  I just let it go.  I did have to buy another type of ear pieces because the ones provided are not very workout friendly.  They tend to fall out.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my new shuffle.

Title: Not very reliable
Content:
I purchased the first one of the DCC-1200 coffeemaker about 3 years ago.  This pot lasted about 2 years, which I thought was acceptable since we always have a pot of coffee going at our house.  When it finally died, I bought another one, but after about 7 months, the hot plate burned out.  I contacted Cuisinart Customer Service and they sent me a new pot under the warranty.  Now after about 7 months again, the replacement pot is not working properly.  It shuts itself off mysteriously anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours later.  Sometimes it doesn't even finish the brew cycle before it shuts itself off.
I contacted customer service but they said they can only do a warranty replacement one time.  She suggested that I unplug the pot for 5 minutes to see if the timer would reset.  I did this and now it's worse than ever.  I'm now on a search for a more reliable coffee maker.

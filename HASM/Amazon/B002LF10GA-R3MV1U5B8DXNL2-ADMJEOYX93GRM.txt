Title: Amazing laptop, better than any netbook out there...
Content:
This laptop is what every netbook should be - light, small, beautiful, fast, not too hot and not expensive. The one and only bad thing, is the fan that makes a little noise, but is easy to make it quiet by using a small utility you can find on the internet, called 1810tray.
Screen size is everything, and 1366X768 on 11,6 inches is the best combination you can get for an ultraportable laptop... big enough to read through every website without scrolling, and small enough to slip this laptop in every bag you can imagine...

Title: Theory is good
Content:
I really like the fact that it is 360* and is not just one direction or oscillating. It just does not seem to put out enough heat to heat a whole bathroom good. I bought the first one for our living room which has a tile floor. We put it between the two recliners and it keeps the chill off. An elderly lady I care for needed a heater for the bathroom to take the chill off (she needs it 80+ degrees instead of 77). It just doesn't quite do the job for that.

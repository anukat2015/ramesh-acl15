Title: Works great
Content:
This heater is quiet and warms the room nicely.
It would be better if it had a digital temperature setting.  Also, I do not like the fact that the unit light remains on even if the settings are turned to the lowest/off.  I have been unplugging the unit when it's not in use.
Overall, the best space heater I've used.

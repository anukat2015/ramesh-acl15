Title: Heavy coffee drinker delight!
Content:
My present Farberware perc just gave out -- after 25 years. Going all day long every day. Actually, you can replace the heat unit yourself.  Just slip the new one in by unscrewing the big screw on the bottom. (I couldn't get the screw out this time -- guess 25 years was too much for it.) For coffee -- stainless steel never gets a "taste" like aluminum; cleans up easily; and you don't have those paper filters (which I can taste, whatever the make). 
Don't bother with Farberware if you don't really like coffee a lot, use paper cups, Coffeemate and the rest of that.  Yeah, you have to unplug it to shut it off.  Big deal.  The classic percolator -- the real taste of real coffee.

Title: quiet and capable
Content:
This heater was easy to assemble, works flawlessly and most importantly, on the slower fan speed,it is so quiet we can leave it running while we sleep. The circulating feature helps warm more area of the room than our previous stationary heater was able to do. I especially like it because it takes up so little floor space, and is reasonably attractive, not squatty or industrial looking.

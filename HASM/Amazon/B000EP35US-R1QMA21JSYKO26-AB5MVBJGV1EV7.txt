Title: Be Sure To Use Protection!
Content:
I agree with most of what everyone has said. The Nano is great for the gym and the casual music listener. But my god, look at the thing wrong and it scratches. I'm very careful with my things but when the cord from the provided headphones can scratch the screen that's pretty sad. Mine already has several scratches and I've only used it twice. I eventually put the sticker from the original box back on the screen. This thing definitely requires protection.

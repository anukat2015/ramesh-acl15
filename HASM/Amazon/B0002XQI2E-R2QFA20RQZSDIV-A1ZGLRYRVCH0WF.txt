Title: Canon should be ashamed  at themselves!
Content:
If your in the market for a good quality DSLR,I can tell you not to buy the Canon D20 from my experience!!!!! I have been using an Olympus 2.1 camera for the past four year's ,and thought it was about  time for an upgrade.Well welcome to the Canon family with my recent purchace the 20D.Well I took pictures in the house and they were horrible,lighting with or without the flash was terrible.Took the same pic's with my old Olympus and no comparison,they were great.So I was beginning to think that the D20 just wasn't that good for indoor use without it's  bigger flash accessorie.If you read most of the forum's ,that is one of the number one complaint's with this camera.So for the next test  I took some outdoor pic's from my doorstep at noon with the sun behind me,and guess what,white balance is to low and color balance is way to red with the canon.Take the same pic's with the Olyumpus and they were fantastic!I cannot believe that 4 year's after the introduction of my old camera that Canon could scew up this badly! When I use photoshop's auto level adjust it does repair most of the canon's poor picture qualities.Funny though ,the same pic taken with my old Olympus hardly changes at all with level correction in Photoshop.What does this tell you? Now maybe in some of the custom modes you can get a decent picture with a D20,but sometimes I would like to just use it's auto mode and not have to figure out how to make it take a decent pic considering the $2000 price tag.Maybe there's a firmware update coming soon that will correct it's poor pic quality in auto mode?I will never know however because I'm going to rant and rave till they take this overpriced pile of garbage  back !!! I'm  getting  the Nikon D70 instead .See ya Canon,dont let the door hit you on the way out!

Title: So far, so good...
Content:
It has been more than a month since I bought this vacuum, and I am satisfied with it. (so far...) Being bagless is a plus for me. Its cleaning is impressive. You need to empty it frequently but hey, otherwise you need to sacrifice from its compactness, right. I hope it is reliable, lasts for a long time! Need to "wait-and-see"

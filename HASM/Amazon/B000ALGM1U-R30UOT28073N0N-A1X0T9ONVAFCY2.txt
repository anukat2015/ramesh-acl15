Title: Complete Junk - Do Not Waste Your Time
Content:
Because of substantially higher natural gas prices, I bought four (4) of these thermostats to be able better to monitor the heating in my home this winter.
This was a very bad mistake.
The instructions are vague, confusing, impossible to follow and a big waste of time.  You can never be certain that you have accomplished what you wanted to do.  I left my house for several days and thought I had set the thermostats for 50 degrees.  No way.  Each was set for something else even though there is a "Permanent Override" that is supposed to be easy to use.  The problem is that the instructions are nonsense, apparently written by comedians.
If you want to read something that is written in indecipherable Chinlish, go here:

and read the owners manual.  
Were you good a deciphering puzzles in school?
Moreover, the short instructions are printed on the lid in 6 point type.  Try to read them and go blind
It may be a wonderful device but the manufacturer couldn't care less if you can operate it.
Also, the packaging must be made for a war zone.  You need a jackhammer to smash and break into it.  I cut my hands twice using scissors.  Who is the stupid fool who designs packaging like this?
Oh and by the way, the instructions on how to wire it up look like they were written by a mad bomber seeking to blow up your home.
If there was a zero rating for this, I would have given it.
AVOID THIS LIKE A DISEASE!

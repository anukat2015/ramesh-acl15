Title: Save your time and money and pass this one by!
Content:
After researching this product and reading many reviews (admittedly more bad than good), I decided to purchase this product. In fact, I purchased through Amazon due to the fact there would be no hassle if the product failed to live up to its claims. The heater worked fine...for about 7 hours or so and then refused to operate. Customer service was no help. The room was 64 degrees and it was set to high and still would not operate. I'd say skip this lemon. However, if you decide to roll the dice, purchase through a dealer such as Amazon who will not hassle you if you should need to (and probably will need to), return it. And don't forget to open the box carefully so you have something in which to ship it back! Good luck!

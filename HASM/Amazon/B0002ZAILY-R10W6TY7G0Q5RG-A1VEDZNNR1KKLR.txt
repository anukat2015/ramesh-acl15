Title: Amazing for use at the gym
Content:
I don't need to hold 20 gig of music.... this iPod shuffle holds about 8 hours of music, which is perfect for a week of workouts.  The best comparison I can think of is that this is like a personal radio station that plays only music you love.  The shuffle is so light, you'll forget you're even wearing it.  Consider it for what it is -- it's not an iPod replacement, but it sure does the job I need it for.

Title: Perfect companion for my Oreck upright
Content:
We freecycled our Hoover Wind Tunnel when QVC sent our new Oreck (which we love!) but it didn't occur to me that we would be without a way to vacuum the sofas, lampshades, baseboards, etc. until it was too late.
I started shopping for canister vacs (and was stunned by the prices I saw for Miele, Hoover, etc.) when I found an old Panasonic next to the dumpster at our condominium. 
NEVER DO WHAT I DID! It cost a fortune, and took me forever to get rid of the bird mites from that machine that infested our apartment and drove me to the brink of insanity. Plus, I wasted a lot of money on very hard-to-find bags.
But I digress...
So, I had a friend with an older, kind-of pinkish-purplish Mighty Mite, and I remembered being impressed with it when I borrowed it for my car.
I called my friend to ask him what kind it was, and he told me Mighty Mite. He then offered to give me his Oreck over-the-shoulder canister.
I had also borrowed it once, and told him, "Thanks, but no thanks!" (If you have ever used that terrible Oreck companion canister vac, you'd never characterize the 12-amp Mighty Mite as being "loud.")
This Mighty Mite is much improved over the older one my friend has-- onboard tool storage, a place to wrap the cord-- but best of all is how stable it is when you stand it on end to clean high shelves, tops of bookcases, etc. 
The included combination tool with brush is a definite weakness, but I went down to the local vacuum-cleaner store, and they fixed me up with really nice tools for just $5.00 each. (I'll keep the included tools in the car.)
Just make sure that what you're getting is the "G" model (12 amps.)

Title: Great Heater but check with Ace supplier for 8330 Model #
Content:
I really like my Lakewood 8320 Ultra-Quiet 19-Inch 300-Watt Tower Heater with Carbon Fiber Technology which is rated at 300 Watts.  You might think that the 300 watts is not going to be enough heat for most rooms, and you'd probably be wrong.  I estimate that it produces much more heat than my other "600 Watt" portable fan-type heater, yet it is totally silent, less bright than the infrared dish heaters and it does not produce any odors like ceramic and oil heaters are famous for.  Just check with the Ace Hardware outlet supplier before buying or wait for Amazon to get the 8330 back in stock.  I would estimate that the heat output from the 800 Watt setting on it would be equivalent to approxomately 2000 Watts on a ceramic or other type of heater--and you save carbon and the do the environment and your electric bill a favor!

Title: Great for Exercising
Content:
I have the 30 and 80 GB iPods that my wife and I use at work each day, but they were a little too bulky to take to the gym or while in-line skating.  So I decided to give the new shuffle a try.  I have been very impressed.  I was actually able to fit about 265 songs on to it after selecting the 128 conversion option that is included in iTunes for the shuffle and that is plenty for quite a long time of repeat free listening.
I have used bikes, steppers, ellipticals, and lifted with just about every piece of equipment in the gym and this thing never gets in the way.  I have even accidentally hit it with dumbbells a few times and it keeps on going without any problems.
Also the headphones that come with it are a great length, I have had some in the past that are too long and get in the way and snag on things, but when I clip the shuffle on to my pants pocket, the cord is just the right length.  I have both the silver, which I got before the colors were available, and the orange and I have not had any problems with either one.  Apple did it again, I can't wait to see what they come up with next!

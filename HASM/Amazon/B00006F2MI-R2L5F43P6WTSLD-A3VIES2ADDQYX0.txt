Title: Great Caraffe - that's about it
Content:
I wanted to get a grind in brew coffee pot with a caraffe so options under $300.00 were limited.  I found this and really liked the look.  Overall it's easy to figure out (if your not one for directions) BUT it really has some faults that need to be corrected.  The filter door pops open randomly.  The first two times (after a brief freak out) I tried to take a look at how I was doing things to see if maybe how I put the filter in or the plastic top was actually causing the door to pop but I couldn't see how I could be more careful.  I actually had one run of about
6 pots of coffee with no issues but the messes just keep happening and my frustration level reached it's limit.  I boxed the thing back up and returned it.  The positive is the caraffe.  It keeps the coffee hot even overnight.  I hope Cuisinart can figure out how to improve the filter door - they'd have a pretty great product if they did.

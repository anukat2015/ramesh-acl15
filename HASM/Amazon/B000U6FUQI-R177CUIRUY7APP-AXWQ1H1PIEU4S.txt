Title: Great concept, poor execution
Content:
Before I bought this little guy, I read a lot of reviews that described this vacuum as being a good "daily use" vacuum and not a good overall vacuum. Really though, that is what I needed, especially the easy to pull out and use cordless vacuum. Well, sadly, it's not even a real good daily vacuum. 
While it is great because is so easy access it prevents a lot of procrastination that comes with vacuuming, it still doesn't do the one thing well that vacuums need to do - suck. I was using it on hard floors but the success of it picking stuff up was pretty poor. I mean, yes, it sometimes picks up some things, but if something is too big in weight or size, it's getting left behind. I mean we're even talking just crumbs of a substantial size. It will push them around a bit with the stationary brush but it won't suck them up. I thought maybe it was losing suction because it needed to be emptied more often. Tried that, not much better.
So after having this toy a few months and letting the happiness of having a new product fade, this vacuum was all in all a loss. Great idea, great looking, but when it comes down to it, it did not do the one thing well that I need a vacuum to do.  Also, since the return policy was it has to be returned UNUSED to Target stores (who I bought this from and who Amazon had listed as the primary seller at the time), I didn't. Luckily I got it on Clearance so it didn't lose as much as I had too.
I think next I'll try a Roomba.

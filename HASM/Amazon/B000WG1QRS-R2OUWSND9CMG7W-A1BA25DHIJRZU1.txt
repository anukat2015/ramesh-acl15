Title: Very Disappointed
Content:
A friend of mine bought a V1 Zune and enjoyed its ease of use:  simply plugging it into a computer, and dragging over songs to add to the player.
Unfortunately, the V2 Zunes use a "special" software package to sync up with your computer collection - ultimately an iPod-esque program that is as useless and annoying as it is stupid.
Not to mention, the Zune broke within 2 weeks of having it - the back light only comes on when it wants to, sometimes it's prompted by shoving in the headphone jack/power cable in really tight.
I have a flash version, and while it charges up in about 45 min, it charges down in about 2hrs - simply unacceptable for a little flash player these days.
There's literally nothing good to say about this - it's annoying to use, crappy-cheap, and way to expensive for what it is.  Go off and buy some cheapo MP3 player instead of this ripoff.  Actually, I guess the FM radio is okay when it actually gets a signal-which never happens indoors, but whatever, I've gotten used to being BF'd by this MS junk-piece.
Also, I bought the car-charger/FM transmitter device - complete piece of junk - only buy if you need the car charger and live where radio towers don't exist.

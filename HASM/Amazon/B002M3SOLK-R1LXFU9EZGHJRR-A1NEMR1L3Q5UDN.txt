Title: Forget it
Content:
Unless you plan to run with this thing in Anchorage during the winter, you better get another player. One drop of sweat and the headphone controls are gone. I got tired of exchanging headphones on Apple stores, especially as the attendants tend to react as if you are the only person in the world with this problem. I got an adaptor for ordinary headphones that also stopped working after a long run and a few track changes with some sweat on my hand.

Title: very solid netbook choice
Content:
Pros: lightning fast, good battery life, great screen res, great size, very lightweight. Great all purpose netbook that has some power to it.
Cons: the the cover (outside of screen) smudges and scratches very easily. Also, they take FOREVER to ship windows 7 (i bought it pre release).
I would easily recommend it.

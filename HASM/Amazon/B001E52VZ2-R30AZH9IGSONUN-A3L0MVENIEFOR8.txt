Title: Great vaccum for the price
Content:
Pros:
-Great suction, even with the bag 2/3 full.
-Lightweight, compact design, easy to hand carry.
-Gets warm but not too hot to carry.
-Swiveling wheels make for good maneuverability.
-Vacuum hose swivels on both ends, keeping hose twisting to a minimum.
-Comes with a floor tool (best for hard floors, adequate but not great for rugs/carpet), duster, and crevice tool.  Handle has an adjustable suction port.  
-Build quality is pretty good, considering price and weight.
-Bag changes are ridiculously easy, and bags are designed with a cardboard flip cap to help keep dust from spilling out.
-Long power cord.
Cons:
-Floor tool tends to drag on rugs/carpet.  
-Vacuum hose made of thin gauge plastic, try not to step on it too many times.
-Cord management could have been improved with a cord clip on the plug that actually fits the cord diameter, along with an easy-off swivel hook for the cord. 
-No HEPA filter (if you need that sort of thing) but then again that's one less thing to change/clean.
Overall:
This is a great canister vac for people in small homes/apartments, or homes with mostly hard flooring.  Compact, maneuverable, light but powerful.  Suction stays strong even when the bag is starting to fill.

Title: Not bad, but not what I had hoped for...
Content:
On the plus side, this coffee maker is easy to use, and makes fairly good coffee.  The coffee stays fresh tasting longer than that from other drip coffee makers. However, the carafe does not keep coffee hot for as long as I had hoped it would.  After a few hours, the coffee is only tepid.  Additionally, we had a problem with the bottom half of the carafe separating from the top half.  Apparently the seal had broken, and it will not stay together.  I don't think that I would purchase this coffee maker again, unless the aforementioned problems had been corrected.

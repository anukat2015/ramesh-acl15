Title: Good for personal heating, not so much for heating a room.
Content:
I purchased one of these little guys from Wal-Mart a couple of months ago.    It does an adequate job of filling a small area with heat or providing personal heat when aimed directly at you, but it isn't great for providing heat in medium to large rooms.    Additionally, it does produce an odd chemical smell, and because its heating dissipates so quickly its thermostat seems to serve little purpose except to keep it cycling on and off every few seconds once you find the sweet spot.

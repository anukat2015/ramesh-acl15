Title: Great look & feel, questionable performance
Content:
I bought my Touch about 2 months ago and I was impressed by the look & feel of the unit and its software! It has a crisp clean graphics, it's easy to operate, it has some convenient features (notes & calculator [The lyrics are great if you buy the upgrade]).
My problem is it worked fine for about the first week. Then I started noticing that the backlight was dimming in and out randomly. Then the display started to freeze up when you touched it. 
About a month ago it started to shut itself off in the middle of a song and when you go to turn the music back on, the unit freezes for a few seconds, then takes you to the home page. When you click on the music tab, it takes you to some random track listing. Now (a month after this started) it has progressed to doing this almost everyday, and on the days it does freeze up, it's will do it more than once! I've had the unit freeze up 6-7 times in one day before.
Apple says that "freezing" is a common problem, but if I'm going to pay $400 for it, I don't want to come with "common problems". My laptop was only $700 and it came without errors.

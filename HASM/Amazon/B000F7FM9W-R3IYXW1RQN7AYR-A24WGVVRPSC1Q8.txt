Title: Terrific Value For A Couple Mugs Of Java
Content:
This was the perfect solution for myself in many respects.  The cost was very reasonable, the size is small and takes up very little counterspace in height and width, it's very easy to operate, very easy to clean, you can see the current water level in the tank, it comes with a filter however, a paper filter allows less ground sediments, it's easy to pour, it makes two mugs of coffee (as opposed to 4 very small cups) which is all I need. Came with a measuring spoon. The only complaint I read about was that water temp could be higher.  For me, I usually have to put ice in coffee to cool..this is hot but sippable...perfect in my book.  No more blistered roof of mouth! Doesn't compromising flavor. Burner has auto shutoff as I recall. Saves money by avoiding expense of wasted java. Killer product as far as I'm concerned...had good retailer as well...1 shop stop.

Title: I must have a bad one but I'm still not impressed
Content:
We must have gotten a damaged model when we received a Kurv Spice for Christmas. The suction is pretty weak (you have to make 2-3 passes over a Cheerio to vacuum it up) and most everyone else likes the way it picks up crumbs, so ours must be damaged.
However, I wonder if everyone else has to struggle to remove the cap and put it back on every time they empty the trash compartment? Also, a large dust cloud emerges every time I empty the trash compartment. 
With the weak suction and all the other trouble, I've begun to just bend over and pick up the crumbs with my hands like I did before.
I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.

Title: very good build and useful
Content:
i did not buy this from amazon. i bought from mac mall as they always have the best price on macs on the net. i had my white macbook for almost three years. i have been a pc user all my life. the macbook that i bought in 2006 was my first mac, i used to replace my pcs every year or two years at the max. since switching to the mac, i am able to keep my computers for almost three years. 
i own a small business and rental properties. i used my mac to run quickbooks and some windows programs. i use sun vmbox which is free for running windows. i just got my macbook pro 13 inch. this is a real joy to use. i have already transferred all my information to this computer. the lighted key pad and the big touch pad are joy to use. i have bought a speck clear case for this mac. i like the clear case as this makes my mac more beautiful. the aluminum surface is prone to scratches. this is why i recommend a good case.
the battery life is something that i cannot comment on yet. i have not tested the battery fully yet. i am going to update my review as i find out more about this pc. so far i am very satisfied with the performance of this computer both from the looks and functional perspective.

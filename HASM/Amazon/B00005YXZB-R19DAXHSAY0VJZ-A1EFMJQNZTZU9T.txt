Title: Zelco Brisk Brew Travel Coffeemaker
Content:
I really love this coffee maker. I am single and don't like making a large pot of coffee. One cup at a time is fine for me. I always buy whole bean Starbucks French Roast coffee. I keep it in the freezer, in a sealed container, until I am ready to grind it. I usually grind enough for about a week and keep the ground coffee in the freezor also. I put 3 level teaspoonfuls in the Zelco basket and let it brew. The coffee turns out tasting better then what you can buy at the Starbucks coffee shops. I never go to Starbucks anymore for coffee. I love the Zelco Brisk Brew so much that I bought 2 Zelco Brisk Brew coffee makers. One I use every day and the other is sitting in reserve if the every day one breaks down. I don't want to be without a functioning Zelco Brisk Brew coffee maker because I love the taste of the coffee that it makes. You need to buy this coffee maker because you never tasted coffee like this. I take the Zelco out of town also, I never want to be without it.

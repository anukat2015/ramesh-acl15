Title: Very nice
Content:
I like that it has the # pad and full 1080P screen and HDMI HD out + dolby 5.1 out.  Makes it so you can hook it right into anyones home theator and play a blue ray over it.  Runs both Vista and Windows 7 with no issues.

3) The video card despite being a Nvidia 9600 gt can't use the nvidia drivers from [...], you have to get ones co-written by sony/nvidia which only seem to get updated about 1 time a year.

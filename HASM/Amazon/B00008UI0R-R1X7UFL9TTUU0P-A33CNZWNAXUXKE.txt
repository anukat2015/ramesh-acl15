Title: Best little Hoov you've ever used
Content:
The Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Bagless Canister Vacuum is one powerful dirt sucking machine.  It's light weight so it can be carried up stairs by its bale handle.  The power beater head attachment is very powerful.  No need to bend over to turn on and off the machine, all the controls are on the wand.  There are four power vacuum settings so you can us it on drapes, blinds using a low vac setting and then switch to a more powerful setting when cleaning upholstery or carpets.  The unit comes with a beater head, a floor and tile head, an upholstery beater head, a crevice tool that stores neatly on board as well as a small brush head.  The wand is adjustable stretching for taller folks and shortened for shorter one.  Removing, emptying, and reinstalling the dirt collector is very simple and easy.  The unit has a generous retractable cord that is controlled by a foot pedal.  If you are looking for a very well designed, highly maneuverable, solidly built, powerful but relatively quiet, bagless vacuum that's easy to store, and is reasonably priced then take a very close look at this tornadic bad boy.

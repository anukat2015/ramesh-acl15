Title: WOW! What a picture Quality
Content:
By the time, I am writing this review, I have captured more than 10K pictures on this lovely camera. It takes superb pictures. The picture quality is stunning. I highly recommend buying Canon external Flash for better indoor shoots and Canon EF 70-200mm F4L USM lens for stunning pictures. Value for money and once you get used to DSLR, its hard moving back to point and shoot. 
Great camera.

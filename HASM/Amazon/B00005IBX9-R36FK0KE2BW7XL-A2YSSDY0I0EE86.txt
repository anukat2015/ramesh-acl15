Title: Best Coffeemaker We Have Owned
Content:
This is by far the best coffeemaker we have ever owned. The coffee is always brewed very very hot and the heating pad keeps it that way.  The water filter helps improve the flavor of the coffee you brew.  Also, the carafe allows you to pour water in the tank and coffee into your cup with no drips or spills.  Our last coffeemaker was a Capresso coffee and espresso maker that cost us over $300 and it never did either very well.  It was extremely slow to brew, never very hot, and the carafe almost always dripped all over the counter as you poured a cup. We have not found a negative for our new coffeemaker yet.  If you want a coffeemaker that delivers hot great tasting coffee quickly and keeps it hot, then you should buy the Cuisinart DCC-1200.

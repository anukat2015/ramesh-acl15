Title: The coolest little gadget I own
Content:
I have had this MP3 player for about 6 months and I love it!  The sound is awesome and I have also made use of the recording capibilty which is pretty cool. The battery life is pretty good on a single AA battery at around 30 hours. There is a FM radio tuner that is OK, but I never really use that.  The size and weight are reasonable for such a useful little gadget.  I also think the design is pretty durable with regards to the buttons and the control stick.  The one exception to that is the little door that covers the usb connection, but that does not bother me as I usually have the player in the soft case that is included or a harder case I bought separately .  The arm band that comes with this bites though.  If you don't mind dropping another $20 there is a sports armband that you can buy that is really good. Overall I love this player.

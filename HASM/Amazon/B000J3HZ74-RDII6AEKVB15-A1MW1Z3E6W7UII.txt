Title: Cools poorly
Content:
The other reviewer, Alesia, summed up my experiences to a tee (i.e., abysmal). All I will add is that it does not cool worth a darn. I live in Vancouver, BC - not exactly the AZ desert, and it couldn't cool a small with the outside temperature at 85 F if its life depended on it. And it did...trashed it last week.

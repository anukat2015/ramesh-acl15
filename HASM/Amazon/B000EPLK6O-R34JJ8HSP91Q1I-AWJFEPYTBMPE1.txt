Title: Very tidy coffeemaker
Content:
I've had my Zojirushi for about two years now. The experience continues to be a pleasure.
For good coffee, clean surfaces matter a lot. Nothing hurts coffee flavor more than stale oils. Mildewey reservoir surfaces don't help either. For ease of keeping these surfaces clean, this little Zojirushi wins hands down. Nothing else comes even close.
(1) The "splash guard" (just above where hot water hits the ground coffee) is easy to remove and clean with running water. With other coffeemakers, one would need to hold the whole appliance upside-down under the tap. :O
(2) The water reservior and cover are both easily removed for inspection, cleaning and complete drying.
(3) The carafe's inner surfaces are easy to see, reach, clean and rinse. (Same as all coffeemakers with Pyrex-type carafes.)
This machine's other notable feature is the water filter (which can remove undesired flavors from the water just after heating.) I tried my Zojirushi with and without the filter and didn't notice much difference. But the tap water in my town is actually very good, so this doesn't amount to much of a test. I can imagine it helping with, for example, the water where I used to live.
Other aspects of this coffeemaker are good but not unique. The water temperature in mine is about right. (It extracts the right stuff from the ground coffee.) The hot plate is good for warming the carafe during coffeemaking but should then should be turned off to avoid thermal mishandling of the coffee. (Nothing particular to the Zojirushi here, just a good practice.)

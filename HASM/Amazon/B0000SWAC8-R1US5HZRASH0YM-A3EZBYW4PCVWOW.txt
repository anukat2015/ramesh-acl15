Title: Electrolux EL 6988D Oxygen Canister Vacuum
Content:
As a long time user of electrolux products, this is my first dissappointing experience.  While the canister is lightweight, quiet and seems to have sufficient power, the hose is bulky and not very flexible, the handle is big and very uncomfortable in my hand, the handle only turns or pivots in one direction when using the carpet tool, and the tool for hardwood floors is too wide, making it difficult and often impossible to access areas narrower than the 14" head.  Furthermore, with a 14" spread, the suction from the center point to the ends drops off to nothing at the end of the head.
Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product to anyone.

Title: Solid value for for price
Content:
I'm not sure if this will heat a room but it's more than adequate for what I need it for. I've got it in an 8x10 home office setup where it sits underneath my desk which is configured as an L-shaped workstation. It does wonders for keeping bare feet and legs warm on cold hardwood floors. Once it get's going, I keep it about 1-2 feet away on full blast which keep me toasty but not too toasty. My only minor complaint is that is it a little louder than I was expecting...similar to a fan or the sound you get in a computer room, but if I'm listening to music, I don't really notice it.

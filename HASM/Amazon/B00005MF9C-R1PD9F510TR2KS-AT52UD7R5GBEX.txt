Title: grinds in my coffee!
Content:
What a great concept, but with poor execution! I always end up with grinds in my coffee. I don't put too much coffee in the filter (not even half capacity) and I can't see any holes in the filter. Based on what the grinds inside look like after the machine's done brewing, it seems that maybe the water gets pushed out at too high of a pressure, causing the grinds to spray upwards and spill over the sides. Could be that mine is defective? In any case, I do not recommend this product.

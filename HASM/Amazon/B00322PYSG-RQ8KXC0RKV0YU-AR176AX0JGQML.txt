Title: Perfect gift for my wife, make look like a rockstar!
Content:
My wife have always had VAIO laptops, last year we decided to give a Dell netbook a try, we thought smaller will be better, oh boy! we were so wrong, we totally missed the fact that even tough she does not do any very power demanding computing, she grew used to the performance of an actual computer not a toy (Dell).
She didn't want to say anything but I know she wasn't happy with a netbook, so I had to find her a nice PINK SONY VAIO and the only I could find was a flowery version of this one on sonystyle, well my wife likes girly stuff of course but that thing from sonystyle was too much, until I came accross this one on amazon, I'm saved!
Performance out of the box is amazing thanks to Windows 7 and SONY deciding not to fill it up with crapware, It is so good that I skipped my regular formatting/OS clean install that I have performed on each and every computer I (and wife) have ever owned (I switch computers about 6-8 times a year), yes is that good!
Sony's craftsmanship is exquisite and you are paying for it! The finishing is awesome, it is light pink very classy and glossy, keyboard feels great, well arranged and almost silent, mousepad works as expected, the screen resolution is not great but is not bad either, battery life and speakers are ... let say, above average.
Stop thinking about it, BUY IT, you are going to like it. (Amazon's return policy is very accommodating tough... just in case)
Have seen those ads on tv for products that will "make you larger" ? this one will make you 14.1" larger and your wife very 'pleased'. (I know, I'm gross)

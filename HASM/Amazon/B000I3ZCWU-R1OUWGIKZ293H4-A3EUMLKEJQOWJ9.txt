Title: Canon Rebel XTi
Content:
At the time I purchased this camera the thinking was to have a nice entry level DSLR for vactions and family, just to see if this is the route I would go, after all the (PAS) point and shoot of today are very, very good and cheaper by the day! The first images with a "kit" lens, and I was let down by what I shot, not much better then PAS, you can make adjustments in PS3 and it is much improved, until one day I picked up a 70-200 2.8 L series lens for sports and I must say it had a instant "WOW effect! the images I captured were TACK SHARP! magizine quailty without touch up in PS! it began a whole new era in photograpy for me, from that experience I went and purchased the 17-40 L and once again "WOW" untouched images ready for SI, Now let it be known that the Rebel has been nick named by so-called photo snobs as the "Soccer Mom Camera" but no issue on my end, my images are much sharper! Since my Rebel the photo fever has taken off I now have two other higher end DSLR's on of them being a Nikon, for sports these shoot 6 FPS double the Rebel (and double the price) and still the Rebel images are right there with the pro end cameras.

Title: Love It!!!
Content:
This is going to be the second winter I have used this unit. I love the retro/vintage look.. I use this at night in my 20 x 25 master bedroom. I turn down my house's heat to 60 at night, and use this to kick up the temperature so I can sleep comfortably. I rarely use the max. setting. This kicks out enough heat at a low thermostat setting and minumum power, that I have noticed a  drop in my winter heating bill.. I wish they made a bigger version so I can heat the living room as well!

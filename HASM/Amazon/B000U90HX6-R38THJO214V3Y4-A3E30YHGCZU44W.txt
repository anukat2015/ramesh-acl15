Title: It really works!
Content:
I bought this heater to try to warm up an addition on our home.  We've lived here 12 years, and every winter, we've frozen in the den.  It's built on a crawl space, and new insulation, windows, and roof haven't helped.  Needless to say, I've tried several heaters.  Just got the Lasko this week, and it's the first one we've tried that heats the entire room. We're actually at 69 to 70 degrees.  Also, it's quiet and the back of the unit stays very cool, so it can be placed right up against a wall.  I am loving this heater!

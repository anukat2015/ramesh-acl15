Title: A life saver
Content:
We've been using the A/C for about 3 years, now.  It gets incredibly hot in our room, during the summers, and while I won't claim that this actually cools it a whole lot, it does make a difference and since I always have it pointed on the bed, or the computer (depending on where I'm at!), it really makes the heat manageable.  Our current room is the coolest in the house, though, and lowering the temperature by 3 or 4 degrees is about all it takes to make a big difference. When we used to be in the back room, however, it was good to have it pointing at you, but since that room reaches temperatures above 90F in the summer and is poorly insulated, this didn't cool the room more than a degree or two, which left the room still above 90 degrees!  It was great to have it pointing at us, though.  It's not too noisy, either.  Are current roommates living in the hot room are using a larger, more powerful A/C, and it doesn't do any better.  I my opinion, if they would just make an insulating sleeve for the exhaust hose, this would work much better.  I'm pretty dumbfounded by the fact that they don't make such a thing, as these units all need them.  It's not the best, but I'm over joyed with it, simply because it makes the summer heat tolerable.

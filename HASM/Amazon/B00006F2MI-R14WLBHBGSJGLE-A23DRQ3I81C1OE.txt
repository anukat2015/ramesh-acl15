Title: Love it  - great machine
Content:
I got this as a gift but came to Amazon to read the reviews.  Despite what the others say, I have had no trouble cleaning this.  There are only 2 more pieces to wash than a traditional coffee brewer, but if you have a separate grinder you would have to wash it anyway.  Yes the steam gets everywhere, but if you wait a bit for it to cool down, the grounds wash out easily.  The timer is easy to set and so what if the machine always grinds for the same time - it's short, regardless, and I certainly wouldn't pay an extra $50-100 for it to regulate the grind time.  The coffee is great, and the results are consistent.  Even my friends who don't drink coffee have used this with no problem.  I definitely recommend getting the thermal carafe.  I accidentally forgot to pour out the extra coffee one morning, only to come home that night and find it was still steaming in the carafe.  This is just to give you an idea of how well it insulates.  All in all, I couldn't want more in a coffee maker, and am thrilled with my gift.  Plus, it looks great on the counter!

Title: D200 is one of the best digital camera ever
Content:
Before D300 was on the market - this was the best available for this money.
Good for beginners if photography is you serious interest and you are ready for big budget. This camera - is a well refined technical instrument. No 'green' auto modes, only classic camera controls. 
It wants good lens. By good I mean f 2.8-4. Otherwise the camera body becomes too heavy and not at all value for money. If you decide to pay over $1000 for a camera and then save on lens - it's like a big expensive car with small thin tyres that don't really hold the road. So if you condider D200 with e.g. 18-70, or even 18-200 VR, go for D80/D40 instead.
Photography is my hobby, I don't make money with it. I'm with Nikon since more than 10 years and my perfect combination now is:
D200
Nikon Zoom-Nikkor - Wide-angle zoom lens - 12 mm - 24 mm - f/4.0 G ED-IF AF-S DX - Nikon F
Nikkor 35-70/2.8
Nikkor 50/1.8 (almost no use since I got 35-70)
Nikon SB-800 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras

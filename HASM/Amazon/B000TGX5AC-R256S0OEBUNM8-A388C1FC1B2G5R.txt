Title: Good heater, but different from what I'm used to.
Content:
I've had this heater for about 2 years now, and it's worked quite well.
I chose this model and style of heater because I live in a small apartment with a clumsy cat and wanted something she couldn't knock over and that wouldn't have a lot of exposed heat elements that she might hurt herself on.
This heater is a lot different than any portable electric heater I've ever used in the past, because it is a whole ROOM heater and not just a space heater.
It does a good job of heating a space, but unlike dish-type heaters it doesn't generate a lot of heat all at once, and when you put your hand next to it it doesn't *feel* like it's creating a lot of heat. This was frustrating at first, but now I really like it because it means that the heater rarely gets hot enough to be dangerous.
This heater works best when placed near a wall, turned on, and left alone for a while. It can be a bit difficult to regulate the heat in a room because it doesn't have a thermometer temperature readout (just a dial from minimum to maximum heat) but overall I am very pleased with this heater.
PROS:
Conserves energy.
Safer design than most space heaters.
Heats a whole room well.
CONS: 
Does not generate a lot of direct heat.
Somewhat slow to heat a room.

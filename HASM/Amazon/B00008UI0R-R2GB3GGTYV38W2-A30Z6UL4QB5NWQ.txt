Title: Great Vacuum!
Content:
We were skeptical at first, but this little vacuum has proven quite powerful and effective in our home. We've got a mix of hardwood floors, short carpeting, and shag carpeting (as well as area rugs), and this baby can handle them all. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver around the house, and the handle controls to change the suction setting are brilliant. 
Two downsides that don't knock the quality of the vac but might irritate potential buyers:
1. There is no way to connect the attachments to the vacuum; so if you have to switch attachments as your floors change, this can be annoying.
2. If you're not used to bagless vacs, beware that dumping the dust and grime (quite satisfying in the sense that you know how clean your floors are getting!) can be bothersome because it does kick up does and requires that you periodically empty the filter as you're cleaning your house. I've had them before, so new what to expect, but it's not always a pleasant experience. (I do, however, prefer it to having to hunt down bags every few months.)
Even with those minor downsides, I think this vacuum is still fantastic and deserves high ratings. We are incredibly happy with it and were very glad to read the consumer reviews that spoke so highly of it. Great purchase.

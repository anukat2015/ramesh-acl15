Title: Multiple Problems
Content:
We got this computer for Christmas. By New Year's Eve the hard drive had failed. Now Amazon says it is out of stock and can't offer a replacement, so we have to pay to ship it to an Acer repair center for however long that will take.
This computer looks pretty, but looks matter very little if it does no more than act like a high-tech paperweight. I've spent more of my time troubleshooting it and trying to get it replaced than I have using it. Very unimpressed.
Update 3/25/10 
I sent the laptop back to Acer (paying for shipping myself) to have the hard drive replaced. The laptop failed again the same day we got it back and continued to crash over the next week regardless of the applications being run. So I sent it back a SECOND time (again on my dime), with notes on the repeated problems. It came back saying they had reloaded the software on the hard drive, which made little sense given the hardware problems indicated by the error messages. And sure enough, it still doesn't work. No joke, it crashed twice before I could even get an application running. Very unimpressed with the communication from Acer, the sparse notes left by their tech people, and their lack of serious effort to fix the problems in their faulty product
Since I bought this laptop, I've spent just about as much time packing and shipping it as I have using it. BY FAR THE WORST computer purchase I've ever made, and I bought my first desktop back in 1990.

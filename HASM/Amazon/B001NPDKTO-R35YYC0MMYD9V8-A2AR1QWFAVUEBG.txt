Title: HP makes top notch laptops
Content:
I was really surprised to see in 2009 laptop's price above $1000 (except for apple of course).  
However, this laptop can be used both as desktop and laptop, though it's quite bulky for carrying it everywhere. Quick, powerful and really nice looking.  I would say it's a poor man Mac Pro. 
Found it through lsdeal.com and amazon had the best price for this item.

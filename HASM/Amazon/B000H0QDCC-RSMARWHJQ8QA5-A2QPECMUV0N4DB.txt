I don't know what everyone is talking about. This product is great. Everything about is convenient. Its ridicuously easy to use, simple but yet very good. Half of the people on here that are "dogging" this product haven't even bought one. I was going to get an ipod but then i heard about this and decided to check it out. I talked to didfferent people who had or used an ipod before and did a comparison on the the specs of both products online. It also has more features like the tuner and wi-fi. i love it. The only way i could see someone complaining is that OP system has to be Windows XP Professional. But if you don't have that by now, well what can i say. The main reason i bought this though was because all my downloaded songs are from limewire in a windows media format and i heard(an employee from best buy and other ipod users) that the ipod has problems with windows media format. I also saw that someone said when using the Zune, when listening to music and trying to look at pictures at the same time that the music stops playing. Not true. I am doing it now. I would recommend this product to anyone. But it really all depends what operating system you have or if use itunes or limewire because the ipod's and the zunes have different copyrights so you can't buy itunes for the zune in the zune marketplace. I don't have itunes but i did read that if you already have music downloaded from itunes that the zune will automatically change the format when you upload to the zune. but this product is great. i love it.

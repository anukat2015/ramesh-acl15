Title: Great Product
Content:
As a first time MP3 player owner I did extensive online reading prior to my decision.  I purchased the Zen Vision M in January and it has proven to be an excellent decision.  I have had no problems as mentioned by other reviewers, such as initial charging issues or difficulty with navigation.  Granted, menu navigation does take a little practice but being a first time user it took very little time.  I also have not had the screen scratching problem complained about by many but don't know if that is due to a superior than average Zen or I am extra careful with its use.  I ordered the AC adapter and car charger and they work great.  It would have been nice if these were included but I'm not complaining.  
I only have two minor gripes....The first being the manual.  It leaves much to be desired, particularly for a novice such as myself.  I have been unable to find a more complete online manual so it's mostly talking to others that are familiar with the basics or trial and error.  The second gripe is the price has dropped quite a bit since I purchased it.  Good for those of you considering the purchase but frustrating for those that paid the higher price just a few months ago.

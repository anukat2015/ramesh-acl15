Title: So far...So good
Content:
I bought this to replace my Wimpy Sharp 4.0 tiny canister.  I bought new carpet 7 months ago and figured it was time to buy a REAL vacuum.  
As a bad back sufferer, I needed something that was easy to push, lightweight, etc.  I read just about every review out there and decided on this one.  Walmart had it for 167.00, online only.  I printed out the page and brought it to PC Richard here on Long Island.  They honored it and beat the price for $165.  It's a snap to assemble.  2 connections and your done.  I vacuumed my 2 carpets  with ease.  With the brush spinning, it's easy to push around.  Since my carpets hadn't had a great cleaning in months, I set the brush on full spin.  Upon emptying the cup, I discovered ALOT of carpet frizz.  Seems like the brand new brushes trimmed my carpets a bit.  BE CAREFUL with the brushes.  Next time, I'll just use the vacuum with either no or light spin. Other than that, I'm glad I bought this.

Title: Perfect notebook!
Content:
This notebook is perfect! Perfect size, weight, keyboard, screen!  Touchpad needs to get a little adjusted to, especially the touchpad buttons, but after an hour or two of using it, it feels good also!  
Like one of the other reviewers, put in an additional 2 GB of RAM before even turning on the system.  Booted like a charm!  Also, replaced the 250GB hitachi hard drive with an Intel 160GB SSD G2 drive.  Cloned the hard drive image over from original drive to the SSD, everything worked like a charm.  Boots up in less than 15 seconds.
Wish it had built in bluetooth, but taken care of by putting one of those USB bluetooth nubs.
Would highly recommend this notebook who travels often and needs a lightweight travel sized full powered notebook with good battery life.

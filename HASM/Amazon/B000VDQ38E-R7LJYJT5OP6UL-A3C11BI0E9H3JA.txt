I know nothing about vacuums, but i do know that this does the job for all the fur my toy fox terrier leaves behind.  I use it on my microfiber sofas, carpet, hardwood floors, her beds and my bed.  The pet hair attachment is wonderful and easy to use.  I'm sure glad i saved buying this instead of spending hundreds on a dyson.

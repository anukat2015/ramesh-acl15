Title: Love the feel of the Canon 50D.... 5 stars with a caveat*
Content:
The only lens I have is a Tamron AF28-300mm F/3.5-6.3 XR DI VC. This lens is soft soft soft any where above 100mm. I was coming home from just shooting some photos around the county where I live and saw an immature red tailed hawk sitting on a wire right beside a semi-busy highway.It was hunting mice and caught two while I was watching. I pulled off the road into a driveway of a business that was closed, and with this lens shot about a dozen or so pics. Mind you I was only 40 or 50 feet from this bird and did not get a single usable photo. So until I either learn how to use this lens or I spring for an "L"
lens I'll have to wait to review this camera fairly. I'm only doing this one because Amazon asked me to. Any advice would be appreciated also!

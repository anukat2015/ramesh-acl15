Title: Fun while it lasted
Content:
I used this unit about 5 times and really enjoyed the freedom of using a wireless unit while I worked out, even though the sound quality was poor, and I am far from picky.  That is due to the wireless ear buds being huge, and I don't have small ears, either.  They pretty much just rested on the outside of my ears, held in place by the ear hooks, necessitating my turning the volume all the way up to partially drown out the sound of the gym's music.  Since the fit was by no means tight, the sound quality of my own music was quite poor as well.  The ear attachment was hard to get on and off, and after those 5 uses, the plastic hook that attaches the ear bud to the ear hook snapped.  I tried to use the wireless headphones without the ear hook, but it fell out about every 5 steps I jogged.  A replacement ear hook is not available from the manufacturer, and replacement wireless headphones will cost me more than the entire unit did.
I am hooked on wireless headphones for making my workouts more productive and pleasant, but will be looking elsewhere for my next player.

Title: Space Heater
Content:
These heaters are very nice if used at a distance of a few feet, but I can't see how they could possibly warm up even a small room. With our cold Winter, this year in Florida, the C/A [and heat!] breakers keep blowing and one of these heaters make my small bathroom bearable and also the area right next to my computer----but no space larger.

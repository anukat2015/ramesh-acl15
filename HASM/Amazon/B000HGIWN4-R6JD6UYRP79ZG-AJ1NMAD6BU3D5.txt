Title: D80  Awesome DSLR
Content:
I decided on this camera over the D40 and the Rebel XTi due to the fact it takes great shots right out of the box.  I am still learning to use an SLR so this helps.  Also the meni system is very user friendly on the Nikons and the kit lens is pretty decent.  I was able to get a bag, flash, and a 50mm lens on ebay as well.  Great camera, I cant wait to figure out all the features.  If you thinking about buying this model, do it!

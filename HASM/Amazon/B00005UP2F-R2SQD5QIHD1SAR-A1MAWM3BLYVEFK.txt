Title: Great deal on a quality machine
Content:
After much searching, both locally (in the large *-Mart's &amp; specialty vacuum retailers) and on the 'net, we decided this was the one for us.  What a great choice.  It really does the job well on hard floors(we have a lot of tile) as well as on carpet. We have indoor dogs, so this unit gets lots of use -  I like the power, the ease of use, and the sturdiness of the unit.  Very good value for the money spent - I highly recommend it.

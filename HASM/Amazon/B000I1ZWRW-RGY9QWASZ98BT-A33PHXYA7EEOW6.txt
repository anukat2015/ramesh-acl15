Title: Great Camera, but...
Content:
I recommend not getting the kit, as the lens in it is rather pathetic. The only plus the lens had is that it was cheap. Personally, I would recommend getting the body only and then purchasing a prime 50mm 1.8 instead. The total price will be comparible to getting the body and kit lens and you will have a better lens overall. 
A great camera for the price.

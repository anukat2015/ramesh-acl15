Title: Almost the perfect device...
Content:
Overall the AV480 has been an excellent investment, however there are some nagging issues.
Pros:
-Large HDD
-Full color display
-Large display
-Optional FM with 30second delayed recording
-CF card support
-Usual pros for a robust media player
Cons:
-Very sensitive to static shocks.  It doesn't seem to have any permenant effect on the device, but a small shock will require a reboot.  Shuffling your feet in the winter is a bad idea.
-Inability to play music with photos.  (email to Archos has cornfirmed this will NOT be fixed with a firmware upgrade)
-Lacking a scroll wheel (or other way to quickly peruse long lists)
-Slightly bulky

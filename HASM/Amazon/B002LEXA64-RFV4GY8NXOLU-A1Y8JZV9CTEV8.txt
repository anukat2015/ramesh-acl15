Title: one of the best "notebooks" out there for the money
Content:
Please note "notebook" not laptop. No optical drive, no core 2 duo but the new ULV core 2solo which rocks! It does what it says and then some. I've improved my by adding 2 extra GB of RAM for $26. Upgrading the RAM took about 50 seconds, piece of cake!
Get it while you can!

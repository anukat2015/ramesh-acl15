Title: Great Package
Content:
I bought this model about 1 week ago. It is a great system with a clear, bright and colorfull screen. I have XP Pro on it right now and it is flawless. The video card is pretty good too as it has 16 MB with 3D MDAC engine, I belive. Fifa 2001 runs smooth on it, although to get fast non choppy play I have to cut the rendering in half. It still looks killer with the DDR video memory though.I am sure that with an additionanl 256 (for a total of 512) MB of ram, it would perform much better. The 15 inch screen is impecable as sony always is.Loaded with features it is an expensive piece of hardware, but well worth it depending on your profession. I am an Application developer and have put this baby to work with no problems.I did notice one bad thing, but this could be the norm for laptops. It takes about 10 minutes to copy 500MB from one partition to the other. Weird. ---- UPDATE ----The system comes pre loaded with Trend Micro's PC Cillin antivirus. The real time virus protection was causing the copy to slow down and even bring the computer to its knees. After turning the real time file scan off, it worked like a charm.---- UPDATE ----I added 256MB More to the laptop. Now it has 512MB of Ram and the system is working better and faster. It has not crashed on me once. The book runs very cool. It heats up just enough to let you know it is alive. I took out the hard drive and it is an IBM 4200 rpm drive. I had a Thinkpad T21 Pent III 750 with a 14' screen before. This Sony Vaio beats the heck out of the T21, let me tell you that right now. If you decide that this is your system, enjoy it!!All in all I rate it a 4+With the added Memory it is a 5 star product. :)

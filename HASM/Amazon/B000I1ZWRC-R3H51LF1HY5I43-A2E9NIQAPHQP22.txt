Title: always in my bag, ready to go!
Content:
Love this new camera!
Since I received it 4 weeks ago, it has been my constant companion.
The learning curve was quick.  Ergonomically, it fits in hand like a glove.
Love the larger display screen, love the ease of menu options and quick change settings.
At first I thought switching from regular 35mm and digital point and shoot would be difficult....
but I was wrong.  Canon makes it an easy transition with this camera.  Things that used to take hours in the darkroom or one would have to just rely on that the lab would get right, you can easily do both right on the camera and then fine tune later on your computer software.  Love the B&W and sepia tone options!  They have said that the 10.1mp don't make that much of a difference over the 8mp models... but I notice it.  Fine details are clearer and remain so after cropping and enlarging.
I cannot wait to add other lenses and extras. 
Photographic freedom!  This camera allows you to be 'creative' without worrying so much about the technical aspects.

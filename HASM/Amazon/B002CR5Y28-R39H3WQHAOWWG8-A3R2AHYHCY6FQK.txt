Title: Perfectly engineered
Content:
I've always used cheap uprights and was apprehensive about spending this much for a vacuum.  But I am so pleased I did.  Forget uprights, this canister is the way to go.  It makes vacuuming a pleasure.  Then engineering is really top notch.  It's lightweight, small, rolls easily, and I can actually clean under furniture now.  The variable speed settings are nice for throw rugs, but under full power it really pulls up the dirt.  Get the turbobrush.  I was skeptical at first, I thought a brush powered only by air would bog down under shag carpet.  It did not.  And it SOUNDS like a turbo engine spinning up.  Easy to store in a small closet with the retractable wand and cord.  The only reason to go back to an upright is if you have rooms with all carpet and no furniture to negotiate.  Best feature - it's QUIET.  I used to wear earplugs while vacuuming, but not anymore.  Nice job Miele!

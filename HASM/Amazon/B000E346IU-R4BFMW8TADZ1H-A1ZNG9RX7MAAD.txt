Title: AT LAST--HEAT WITHOUT NOISE OR SMELLS!
Content:
This is the latest generation of these excellent heaters. There is no sound, no smells (just let it gas out in your garage for a day or two, turning it on and off) and it is light enough to move from room to room SINCE THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF THESE, JUST LIKE THEY SOLD OUT OF THE TWO VERSIONS BEFORE IT!! Someone is asleep at the switch re: these great heaters.

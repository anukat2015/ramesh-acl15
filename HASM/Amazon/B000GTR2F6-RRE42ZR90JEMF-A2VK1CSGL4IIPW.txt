Title: Wonderful . . .  when it works.
Content:
I received the B70 as a Christmas gift and was thrilled.  It took a while to find a coffee strong enough for my taste, but once I tasted Emeril's Big Easy Bold, I was hooked.  Unfortunately, within one month my machine malfunctioned like so many others.  It would make a loud noise like it was trying to work and then shut off.  I called customer service and they sent a new machine.  It worked for less than a week!  I called again and they sent a second replacement. I was told that the problem had been resolved and I should have no more problems. Unfortunately, though, I have had this third brewer for just over a week and it is already shutting down automatically. I am so disappointed.  I like it enough that I don't want to give up on it . . . but, really, enough is enough.

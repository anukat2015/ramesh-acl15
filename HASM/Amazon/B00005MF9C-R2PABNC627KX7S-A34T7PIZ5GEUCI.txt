Title: watch out for spills
Content:
I have this model and I truly regret buying it.I had the older version,and was so happy with it that I thought this one would be just as good.I have never had so much trouble in trying to fill the water reservoir.I noticed they still make another model that looks like the old one I had and is cheaper.That is my next purchase.

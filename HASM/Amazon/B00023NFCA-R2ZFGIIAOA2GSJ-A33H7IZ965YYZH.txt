Title: Fits like a glove
Content:
If you have had minolta cameras before you will feel right at home with this new maxxum 7D (Dynax in europe). I have been a long time minolta user and was very glad to see this camera finally hitting the market. Just last week I finally got the chance to handle one at a local store. I am sharing my initial impression of the camera.
Pros:
1) Feels great in hand. I was very comfortable with its ergonomic design.
2) The AS (Anti Shake) feature is truly useful. I have been reading posts from canon users as well as minolta 7d users and looks like the AS is coming really handy in low light situation. Canon and Nikon both have similar technology for reducing shake at low light or with high level zoom. However, those technologis are built into the lense. Because of that those lenses are more expensive than the regular lense. BUT Minolta has the AS built into the body. That's why any regular Minolta/maxxum AF lenses can be used and benefit from AS technology. That is the key difference and creates this initial price difference.
3) Color is great right out of the camera. No retouching is necessary.
4) Large buffer for continuous shooting
5) Takse variety of preexisting minolta lenses
Cons:
1) PRICE ! I think the price will scare away several would be amature photographers. Especially since a digital rebel (not as feature rich) can be found less than 1000$.
Bottom line. If you already own minolta  lenses this maybe the right camera for you to leap into digital photography. Or else you may want to take a look at digital rebel and see if that fits your bills.

Title: MacBook Pro Issue
Content:
I purchased this Macbook Pro 2.53 with 4GB DDR3 ram. A month later I noticed the processing speed slowed significantly and the cooling fan became lower. I took it in an Apple store nearby and I was told that the the fan works and there is nothing they can do about the noise. I asked them if they could replace it with another one considering it was only a month old, but I was told that replacement is never an option unless the computer is broken. I am very disappointed considering how much I paid for this computer.

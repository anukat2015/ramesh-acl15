Title: Quick and powerful but sensor dust is unfortunately there
Content:
I bought the camera based on weather proof, speed and sturdiness reasons. I have no complaint on the speed and the autofocus capability. Even though the picture quality looks no different from 30d, I feel that the camera delivers much better auto-focus effect and the speed. In an ideal enviornment, you will not find the edge of 1d mark ii N. HOwever, 1d mark ii N shines when the low light, quick focus, good battery duarbility are required.
The thing bothers me about the camera is not the size and the weight. It is the sensor dust. Why will a weather proof camera collects dust no differently from 30d? After 1000 pictures, the senor dust showed up. I thought the sand, dust should be avoided since the camera is "weather proof" - against water, sand, dust. Why is there dust so pravellently accumulating? If there is no dust or the dust can be easily removed from the sensor, I will give it 5.

Title: holy hot coffee, batman!
Content:
I got this coffeemaker for Christmas 08 and after nearly 2 months of daily use I feel confident that I can say it aloud:  I love my new coffeemaker.  I can set the timer to make coffee at 6:30 and then sit around and drink hot, un-burnt coffee for 4 or 5 hours (I don't know why other reviewers think the coffee isn't hot enough).  Also, it only needs to stay on while it's brewing--and then it turns itself off--no more leaving the coffeemaker on all day by accident (phew!).  also, it filters its own water--awesome!
my only beef is that it's a little too tall for my counter--but that's certainly more a problem with my being able to measure than a problem with the maker itself.
overall, two mugs up!

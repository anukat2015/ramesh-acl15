Title: what a piece of junk
Content:
I have had this computer for 6 months and it has been nothing but a problem. It shuts down whenever it wants to. I have had the hard drive crash and 3 cdrom combo drives. As of now I have had no satisfaction from Toshiba.  They just keep sending boxes and I just keep sending it back.

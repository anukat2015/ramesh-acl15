Title: Sadly, it didn't work for long...
Content:
The Zen is a beautiful looking media player, but unfortunately it just doesn't work. It freezes constantly. I can get it to start playing music and by the second or third song, it freezes. I've tried re-setting, re-formatting, updating the firmware... all to no avail. I'm very disappointed, but in going to Creative's website for support, I see that MANY people are having the same problem. What product will I get to replace the Zen? I have no idea, right now I am just very disappointed. I would highly suggest purchasing a different brand of media player.

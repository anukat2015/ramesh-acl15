Title: Great little Vac
Content:
This is a great handheld vacuum.  
We wanted something to pick-up dirt from our hardwood floors in between our weekly clean.  The rubber soft-tip prevents the floors from being scratched (which our previous handheld did) and the power level is powerfull enough to pick everything up.  My only negative comment would be that I would have liked to have the option to wall mount (in lieu of displaying it like a piece of art).

Title: STAY AWAY from AMCOR and Their Products.
Content:
The Unit is JUNK.  The customer service is THE PITS.
When the AC works, the unit is LOUD but cools as advertised.
But my unit (as did apparently several other customers' units) failed (the compressor) before it reached 40 hours of usage.  When I called AMCOR for a warranty replacement I got a customer service voice recording saying someone would call me back within three business days.  And that's exactly how long they took to call me back to see what was wrong.  What?!
Then, they charged me a hundred bucks for shipping.  Junk product with poor customer service and ridiculous warranty terms = AVOID AMCOR.

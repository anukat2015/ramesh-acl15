Title: It's great if you like Filthy floors and throwing away money
Content:
Far and away the most poorly designed product since the Yugo. The belt came off within the first few hours of light use. I put it back on. It came off again. Rinse and repeat. I sent it back. They sent a replacement. The belt came off. Of course it did: It's designed wrong. There's nothing to hold it there, so it comes off. I would, too.
If you're planning on buying this anyway, try this first instead: Line up about 170 one-dollar bills on a 10 x 17 square. Tape the edges together. Lay it over your rugs and floors to keep them clean. At least it'll last longer than this thing did, and you won't need to go to all the trouble of digging for Hoover's phone number.

Title: Great entry level SLR Digital Camera
Content:
This camera takes excellent pictures for a novice like myself.  I wanted this type camera for it's ability to have lenses for different purposes.  It does that and more.  I don't pretend to know how to use all the features included in the camera but I'm learming. The only negative thing I might mention, but will have to see how it holds up is the feeling that the camera is made mostly of plastic, expensive plastic but plastic.  Other than that, I'm very happy with it.

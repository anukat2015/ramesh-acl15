Title: Good product but not for me.
Content:
It does what its supposed to do. Humidity levels does rise and there's a cool breeze when you put some ice cubes in the storage box but that's about it. Well, the remote is nice too. Its definitely not an A/C. If you are thinking about getting this unit versus a portable A/C, then you probably need the latter. I returned the product within a few days and Air & Water were very prompt in issuing me a full refund. Kudos to their customer service. If you think you need an Evaporative Cooler, this is a pretty good unit. Just make sure its suitable for your surroundings. It just doesn't work where temperatures and humidity levels are already high.

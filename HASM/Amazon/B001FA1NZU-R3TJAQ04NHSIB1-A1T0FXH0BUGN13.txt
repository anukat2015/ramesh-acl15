Title: The coolest device we have ever owned
Content:
This thing is flat out amazing.  Previously my PSP was my most dense piece of impressive technology.  My wife's Touch  blows it away.  Of course it is a great iPod (although I think the click-wheel might be a little better for navigating), but it also is great for flashcards for the kids, little games, email and internet.  Simply amazing.   It was worth every penny for us and was a nice replacement for our 2nd gen 10gb ipod which failed us after 5 years.  
I am pretty sure we have already downloaded  $20 worth of apps.  I am embarrassed to be gushing - but this is a really impressive little device.

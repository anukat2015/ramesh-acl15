Title: Best Entry Level DSLR
Content:
I have this SLR with ZD 14-54 2.8-3.5 lens.
There no other body and lens combination under one grand that can match the value and quality of pictures I can get from Olympus. The E520 is compact yet has super ergnormics when compared to E420 and Canon XTi, both of which I owned at one time.

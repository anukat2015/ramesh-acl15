Title: Nice Upgrade
Content:
I have been using a Keurig B70 for a couple of years.  I was having issues with coffee grounds overflowing into my morning cup of joe (nothing wakes you up faster than choking on a mouthful of coffee grinds).  I purchased this new unit because of the claim that it was quieter and has an iced tea setting.  All I can say is...wow!  This unit did not disappoint.  It is whisper quiet compared to the other Keurig models.  Now I'm not afraid to brew a cup early in the morning while others are sleeping.  I am very happy with this upgrade.....and no more coffee grounds.

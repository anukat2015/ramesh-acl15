Title: Really Doesn't Heat Much
Content:
I have to agree with the handful of disappointed folks.  I was so excited for this heater.   It looks as charming as I'd hoped, but when we put ours in a chilly 12X14 back room it felt like warm breath was coming from it, but not much more heat than that. In fact, we get more heat from our tiny $24 Lasko ceramic heater. I think if I run this Dimplex for an hour, it can warm the room up just a litte bit, but I'm left to wonder: is the room just too cold to warm up?  Or did we get a bad heater?

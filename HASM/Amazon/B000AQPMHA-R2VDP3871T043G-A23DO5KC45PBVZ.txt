Title: Great Coffee
Content:
I just couldn't wait to get this thing out of the box. The anticipation of having a fresh cup of coffee literally at any given moment was unreal. I like to drink coffee but will not brew a whole pot for myself, so this brewer made alot of sense for me. And let me tell you I was not disappointed. It makes a cup, a small cup that is, less than 8oz though. So if you are looking to fill those travel mugs, it would probably take 3 rounds. The coffee tastes great, piping hot, and full of flavor. I especially like the dark coffees from Green Mountain. All the others aren't as flavorful. I am not much of a flavored coffee person so I cannot offer anything on those. The tea is great, breakfast tea that is. I am very happy with this machine. If you are the lone coffee drinker in your home, or most of the time, you'll love it. And even for entertaining it is quite impressive to offer guests a variety of flavors for them to choose themselves. I say buy it !! You won't be disappointed!!

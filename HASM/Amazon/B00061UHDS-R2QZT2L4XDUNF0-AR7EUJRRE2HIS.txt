Title: I Love this Camera!
Content:
The E-300 is one outstanding digital camera.  I have been doing 35mm for many years, and it was nice to find a digital camera that has the look and feel of a high end 35mm.  It even has the sound of the shutter clicking and the film winding sound also.  A very easy to use camera, once I figured out the menus.  Pictures are outstanding even at the middle of the resolution range.  Good job, Olympus!  But... I could mention two complaints, neither of which will make me return the camera.  One, the camera does have a bit of a problem taking flash pictures in low light conditions.  And the other problem, an obvious money-grubbing device (Bad Olympus!), the AC adapter that sells for $130 or so could be replaced by any $10 wall wart, except for that little proprietary connector on the camera.  Come on, Olympus, what's up with that?

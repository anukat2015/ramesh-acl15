Title: Love It
Content:
I've had this laptop a little over 3 months now. I cant complain about it at all. I've been enjoying it!! Due to me using a desktop computer for years, it took a while for me to get used to the keyboard. I never could get used to using a touch pad so I bought a mouse, haha! Overall, Im enjoying this computer.

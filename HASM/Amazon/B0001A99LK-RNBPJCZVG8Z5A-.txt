Title: Not a bad product, but costs way too much.
Content:
While I don't have any issues with the product itself (although the battery is known to go out on ipods), it costs FAR too much.  For less than the price of one of these you can get another player with 5 times the amount of storage!  There was even one on here recently (Archos 20GB) that was HALF the price of this and five times the storage space!Only get this product if you're concerned more about being trendy than listening to music.

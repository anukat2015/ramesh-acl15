Title: LOVE this coffeemaker!
Content:
Spent twice as much on an similar upscale competitive model that had to be returned twice due to leaks.  Third time was a charm - abandoned upscale and bought Hamilton Beach. I love it.  Easy to use, easy to clean, coffee tastes great, travel mug fits easily, hands free operation when "pouring" a cup. The fill lines are a little difficult to read, and it is too tall to open the lid under the cabinets to be filled - but both are tiny annoyances that I will gladly take for the positives this machine offers.  A great pot at a great price!

Title: Convenient...but frustrating!
Content:
My mom has a DCC-2000 and I was instantly intrigued.  We think that it makes great coffee (we grind our own and make sure that we used enough beans to provide the flavor that we want).  And we love the convenience of not having a glass carafe to sit on the warming plate until the coffee tastes burnt -- hence the 3 stars.  However, as with others, after not quite a year, we started having problems with the pot suddenly losing power after brewing, in mid-brew, sometimes just in the middle of the night.  And, I'm not refering to just the pot brew cycle not working, our pot lost the clock display and everything as if it had been unplugged.   At first we thought that we'd had a breaker switch in the garage flip or something, but no, it was the pot.  We contacted Cuisinart last fall and they'd obviously dealt with this before because they were quick to advise me to "unplug the pot for several hours to allow the computer chip to reset."  We did and it worked...for awhile.  Then the power disruptions became more frequent from several times per week to randomly turning itself off and on during a single brew/warming cycle.  Now, it's not working at all.  Do I want another one?  I don't know.  Maybe if I don't have to pay for it since Cuisinart knows of the defect and should replace it for nothing.

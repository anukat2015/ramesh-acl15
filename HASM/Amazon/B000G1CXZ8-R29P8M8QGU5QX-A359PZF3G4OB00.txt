Title: Works well for a medium room
Content:
I use it in my 14x12 room and it works reasonably well. Thermostat
measures temp. around unit so it is not very accurate, better to set
it a bit higher or use the timed mode. The dry heat it produces is
annoying and I need to use a humidifier also but that's not a problem
specifically with this heater, most heaters are that way.
The heat is dissipated via an internal fan, this is not obvious from 
the description on the packaging.
Got it at Costco for $38, why pay more? Good bang for the buck. I have
used it for just two weeks, don't know about reliability.

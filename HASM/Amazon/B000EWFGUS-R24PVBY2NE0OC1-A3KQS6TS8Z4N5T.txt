Title: Good replacement for more expensive model
Content:
This is a somewhat streamlined model of the Hamilton Beach "eclectric" version (which is overpriced, and should have lasted longer than it did). This new model does a good job of brewing coffee quickly, easily, and at a good price. My only quarrel is the clumsy, automatic time-set. If you're at all challenged in finger dexterity (I have arthritis), and you want coffee ready when you hit the floor, this may not be your cup of t.. er, I mean coffee.

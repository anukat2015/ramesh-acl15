Title: Excellent macbook for the price
Content:
I had ordered this product on the day of its release i.e. 4/13, initially there was no delivery date, but on Monday I got a mail that it was shipped and received it very next day. I love amazon order fulfillment system. This is my first macbook, initially had Dell and Hp. But cant really compare to these brands...especially HP..its crap.
Now back to macbook, I am impressed from packaging itself..just what is needed. Out of the box and its up and running in no time. I initially though that being a windows user will take me a longer time to adjust. But Macbook pro proved me wrong, in a day's time I picked the macbook's world. Now it seems, i am owning macbook since ages.
Its fast, smooth and not much or not too less. Very quiet and responsive. I was waiting for this upgrade for a long time, always felt the pinch of buying 13.3 with less hardware, but now it is just perfect for browsing, gaming and more. I don't need to look for a laptop for next 5 yrs at least. 
Moral of the story, best buy for the price...guys reading this review...don't think too much. Just go for it.

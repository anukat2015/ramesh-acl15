Title: Makes ok coffee.  Hope you never need service.
Content:
Coffee it made was not very hot and ok in quality.  Did not stay warm more than a couple hours after brewing.  Difficult to remember how to set time after power outage or being unplugged - I had to get out manual each time.
After about 8 months of once-a-day use, coffeemaker would not turn off.  Only way to have it stop trying to brew coffee and heating warming plate was to unplug.  This is extreme fire hazard.  
I paid to mail it in for warranty service a month ago and still do not have it back.  Krups USA customer service told me the repair centers have 30 days in which to evaulate product and then it may take 2 or 3 weeks for parts.  This translates to being without a defective and hazardous coffeemaker for about 2 months -- and this is WARRANTY service.  The repair center cannot tell me when they will get to it nor when I should expect to receive it (or a replacement) back.
While maybe the one I got is the only one to fail this way, I suggest if you buy it that you do verify it turns off every day.  I personally will not buy a Krups product again due to the length of time for warranty service.  In meantime I checked reviews and have purchased another brand of coffeemaker as I cannot wait any longer to get my Krups one back (nor am I sure I trust it, even if it is replaced.)

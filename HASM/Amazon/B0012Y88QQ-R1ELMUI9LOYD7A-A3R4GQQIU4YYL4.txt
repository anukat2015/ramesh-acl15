Title: Simple to use, Nice feel, Great photos.....
Content:
This Camera seems to do it all, quite nicely,  I was a little suprised that the Live View feature does not function in the automatic/program modes, but the three inch monitor is a big improvement for viewing the pictures after you take them. So I am still happy, and won't discount my five point enthusiasm.
 I like the weight and the grip, it just feels right to me.  I got some really nice photos with the kit lens. Using it with my 580EX flash was also a breeze.  
I am a point-and-shoot kinda guy, and this camera gets pro-looking shots in full automatic mode most of the time.

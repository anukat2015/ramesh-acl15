Title: The Anti Ipod has arrived
Content:
I have fallen in love with Zune.  I originally purchased myself one for Valentines Day last year and had my husband "surprise" me with it.  Just the fact I did NOT have to use Apple software was a bonus.  I was so taken by the features, I bought my daughter one and gave my 8gb to my husband.  I then had to get a 30gb to replace it.  With the right, free software, I now have over 20 full movies and over 3000 songs on my 30gb.  I will be getting an 80gb or 120gb soon....christmas, maybe?

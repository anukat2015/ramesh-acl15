Title: Awesome camera
Content:
This was my first digital SLR, and it is SO easy to use, and takes great pictures.  However, I should have listened to other advice, as I returned it - and Amazon gave me a full refund, yaay Amazon - because I am getting the same camera with the 18-200 mm lens.  The 105 is fine, no issues other than the zoom is just not quite long enough.
I found the D90 easy to set up, easy and intuitive to use the button functions on the camera without going into the menus, even to do some basic manual adjustments.  Glad I decided on it rather than the Canon.  The shutter speed is great, caught lots of good action shots, exposure was good except for user error, rear lcd screen very clear and nice, flash great - can't wait to get my new one with the better lens!

Title: Overflows over and over
Content:
This is a great idea.....12 cup thermal! Which is why I bought it. BUT, it overflows no matter what we have tried...no, we are not overfilling it, yes, the filter is in correctly.  The problem is the coffee gets backed up on the top of the carafe, doeseventually go in but not before running down the sides of the carafe! It must not be dispersing the air as the coffee is trying to go in the top???  What gives?  Does keep the coffee hot, love the look , the coffee tastes fine, the 12 cup thermal is great idea...but am spending a fortune in paper towels to clean up the "overflow"......

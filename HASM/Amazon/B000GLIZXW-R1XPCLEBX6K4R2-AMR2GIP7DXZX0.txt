Title: Perfect Alternative
Content:
I am very happy with this product. It literally took minutes out of the box to plug it in and have it working in my existing fireplace. I had a plain and ugly black firebox that was in need of repainting but once I put the insert in, the unsightly look of the inside was gone. It does have a heater but since I live in Florida, I haven't used that yet and may not need it. I bought this specifically for ambiance and good looks. The remote control turns the unit on and off at will. The logs are actually styrofoam and the little accent colors are made of foil but it all comes together to make a perfect faux fire. I find it laughable that some expect  a more realistic look with a fake fireplace. I think you get what you pay for and in this case I think you get more because the heater itself would probably be worth the price. The light from the fire is best used in a dark room but you can have it on in the daytime as well. My only hope is that the bulbs last and don't need replacement often as well as other parts that may wear over continued use. I do use it every evening but only for an hour max so as not to overuse it. Well worth the price if you are looking to add some coziness to your home.

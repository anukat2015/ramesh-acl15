Content:
bought this unit 1 month ago and it works great, had to put a small fan behind it and it heats my house very well it is 12 degrees outside and 67 inside while i sit in recliner and write this on laptop, it is worth the money, oh and i have it set on low and on a 20lb tank i get almost 5 days on it , have a great day

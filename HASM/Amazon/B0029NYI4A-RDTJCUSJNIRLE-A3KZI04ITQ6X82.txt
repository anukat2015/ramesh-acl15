Title: Great sound but lacking in basic features
Content:
Things I like about this:
Excellent sound, bass, custom equalizer.
Comfortable earbuds, with Noise cancellation.
Great screen with touch.
Battery lasts long as previous reviews mentioned.
Volume and play/pause forward buttons on the sides.
What I absolutely hate:
No delete feature. I load full albums at a time, and then delete the songs I dont like from my player, but surprisingly this player has no option to delete files. I cant imagine how stupid these guys were making a touch sensitive wifi device without a delete option. 
No sleep option either. Lot of times I have the player on when I go to bed, and set the timer for auto turn off so that I dont end up listening all night. Again very dissapointed, even my tiny sansa clip and samsung from 7 years back had this feature. 
Wifi: I have connected to neighbors unsecured wifi, and the x was fast and efficient browsing the internet. But so far I haven't been able to connect to my home secured network. I would say I am a tech savvy guy, and hooked up lots of wifi things, but this beats me. 
I am still debating whether I should return it. On the positive, this is a unique player with noise cancellation that actually works pretty good. On the other hand expensive and poor functionality.

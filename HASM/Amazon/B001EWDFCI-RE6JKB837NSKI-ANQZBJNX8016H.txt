Title: 8 gig zune  Media player (2nd Generation)
Content:
I have to admit that I was not expecting to have very much memory when I ordered this zune,But as I began loading songs I was amazed at how much it held. I was able to put my entire music library into it.
The quality of this device is by far more then I expected and I really love how easy it is to add songs and etc. They have a set up menu that is easy to understand and access and quick! 
In my opinion the zune beats the i pod by far.
I loved it so much that I bought the 80 gig for my daughter, and she tells me that she loves it, and all of her friends are now going over to the Zunes.

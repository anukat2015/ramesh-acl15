Title: Hums and shuts down on low setting
Content:
Brand new out of the box, this unit emits a very audible hum on the low setting. Also, on the low setting, set to maintain a temperature of 60 degrees in my garage (which does allow it to cycle up/down), after about 3 days its thermal protection system shuts it down. Perhaps my particular unit is defective and should be returned to Amazon.com, but I cannot discuss this with Vornado over the phone because they are closed down for two weeks over the holidays. Also, be advised that: 1) Vornado's instructions specifically warn NOT to use this unit to heat outside buildings or pet kennels, and; 2) if it breaks during its one-year warranty period, Vornado will charge you ...[undisclosed dollar amount] for "shipping and handling" to repair. That amount is almost 17% of the purchase price and is ridiculous, given that actual shipping cost could not be more than ...[undisclosed dollar amount], and "handling" of a defective unit ought to be at Vornado's expense, not the consumer's.

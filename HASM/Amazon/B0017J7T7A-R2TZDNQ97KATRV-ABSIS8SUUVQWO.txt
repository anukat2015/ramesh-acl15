Title: I love it!
Content:
This is by far the best computer I ever owned! Although it's my first Mac product, the operation system is user friendly and easy to understand.  The shortcut keys are very easy to memorize, especially if you already know the fuctions for window. When in trouble, just log on to apple website for video tutorial.
My biggest complain is the DVD drive and the battery.  DVD makes very loud noise but I think I got a lemon, I need to go to apple store to know for sure.  In addition, I also had some problems trying to take out the battery. The case is very tight and hard to manuver.

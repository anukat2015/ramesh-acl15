Title: Great mp3 player
Content:
I love the ease of the Sansa Fuze's controls.  It's much better than the clunky Creative Zen I used to own.  Playback is pretty good as well, and most of my music is in mp3 format, anyway.  I had a Sansa Connect prior to getting the Fuze, and I'd definitely buy another.

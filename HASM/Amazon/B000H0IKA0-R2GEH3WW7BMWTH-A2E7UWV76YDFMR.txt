Title: Ipod is #1 for a reason
Content:
I purchased this new gen shuffle for my father's birthday.  I have the 1st gen shuffle, and I'm so jealous of him having a clip on this one.  What a simple, yet ingenious feature.  I borrow his while I work out 'cuz it's so simple to clip onto my shirt and go.  With the old shuffle, you have to wear it like a big necklace (not good when jogging or jumping rope).  Yeah, I know you can get a armband to hold it, but, I'm cheap and don't want to fork out $ on accessories.  Therefore, the new shuffle has definately got an edge on the old one.
The sound quality is excellent.  I feel that the ear buds that come with it are more than satisfactory.  
I see some people are annoyed that there isn't a screen.  Hello?  That's what the rest of the ipod line is for.  The shuffle is SUPPOSED to be micro sized---do you really want a teeny tiny screen that you'd need a magnifying class to read?  Get real.
The shuffle is awesome and well worth the $79 bucks.

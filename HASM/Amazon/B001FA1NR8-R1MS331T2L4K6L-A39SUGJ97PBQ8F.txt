Title: Excellent sound quality, instructions should inform new users about Itunes
Content:
I've never owned an Ipod before, but I did have a generic mp3 player with limited volume control.  So I had a small amount of knowledge about transferring music to an mp3 player.  My only problem with this mp3 player is that the instructions do not tell you that you can only use itunes to transfer music.  So to inform new users, when I first plugged it into my computer to charge the battery, I got a flashing orange light for about 10 hours.  I had been using windows media player to transfer songs, and it was showing that these songs were on the ipod.  When I unplugged it and turned it on, none of these songs were actually on the ipod, it would not do anything.  After several hours of wasting my time, I did my research and discovered this important piece of information, downloaded itunes, and besides the fact that itunes is much slower than windows media player, I love this ipod.  Once synced to itunes, it finally stopped blinking orange, turned to a green light, and started playing music.  The sound quality is fantastic.  For me, the simplicity is great.

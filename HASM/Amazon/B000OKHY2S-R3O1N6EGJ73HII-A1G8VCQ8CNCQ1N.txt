Title: I'm cool with this product!
Content:
SPT SF-608R Portable Evaporative Air Cooler I live in humid midwest so expectations were relatively low.  It works better than I expected.  It cools and moves air in medium sized rooms.  It also works well equalizing air from a window A/C in one room and an adjoining room without A/C. It moves the conditioned air around. Good buy..much better than a fan.

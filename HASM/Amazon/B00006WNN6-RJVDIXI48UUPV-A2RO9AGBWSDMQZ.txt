Title: Fantastic
Content:
I bought 2 of these for my wife because I had turned down the heat to save on our energy bill. We put one in a room and in a matter of minutes its a cozy warm. In fact, if I turn it on max, it gets too hot. We were able to even turn down our heat even more since they are both so effective. They are also quiet and safe. Great product!

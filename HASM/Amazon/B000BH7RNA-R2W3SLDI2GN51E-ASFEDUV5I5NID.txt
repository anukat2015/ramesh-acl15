Title: Poor quality
Content:
This is such a bad coffee maker.  When you pull out the craffe, the coffee drips onto the hot burner.  Our burner has all the coating worn off now because of the coffee drips.  Many times the filter folds over, allowing the dripping water and coffee grinds to fall into the carafe.  Don't waste your money on this one.

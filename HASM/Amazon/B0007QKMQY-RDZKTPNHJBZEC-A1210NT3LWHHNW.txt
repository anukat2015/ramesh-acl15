Title: One of the Best Cameras Ever, but...
Content:
I have been using this camera for about two years, and I have a long experience in creative photography. I can say without any hesitation that the Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera is on of the best cameras in the market today.
 It has all the sophisticated functions that any professional photographer may need.
 The only thing that I did not like is the lens; I changed it to a Sigma 14 - 200 mm, which is equal to 28 - 300 mm in a conventional SLR. It gives me the ability to zoom from a wide angle lens of 28 mm to a telephoto lens of 300 mm in a second, which is a great advantage in many situations,

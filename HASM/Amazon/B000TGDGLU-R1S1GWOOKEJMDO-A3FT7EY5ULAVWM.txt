Title: Malfunctioned product
Content:
I was so excited to get this radiator but when I received it I noticed that it creates a spark inside when I turn it on or off. I was trying to return it but was told to call DeLonghi customer service, the phone number listed in the instructional booklet never seemed to work. Even though I think it is a manufacturing problem I was told I have to pay the shipping costs for it to be serviced in a service center (new radiator!!). After I considered the cost of shipment of this quite a heavy piece I continuted using it, the spark went away but the heater seemed not to be able to warm up my baby's room on a highest setting. After a month's of use (nights only) our electrical bill was $150 higher than normal - it eats a lot of energy (1500W). I think I will buy a Seimens radiator now they seem to have proven product quality. Anyone wants mine for free? I am throwing it away and I am not buying any DeLonghi products anymore.

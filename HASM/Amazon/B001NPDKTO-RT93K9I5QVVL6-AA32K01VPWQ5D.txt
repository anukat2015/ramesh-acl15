Title: HP HDX review
Content:
HP Pavilion HDX16-1160US 16.0-Inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 Processor, 6 GB RAM, 500 GB Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Vista Premium)
Pluses
- best bang for the buck in comparing to other units in specs of size of hard drive, GHz & ram.
-As usual dealing with Amazon was smooth
Negatives
- Vista sucks compared to XP
- pretty cheap not to include a lock when you close the screen
- Volume of speaker not very loud
- way to glary of a screen
- key board does not give me enough space to place my left hand (trade off having separate number pad)
- The 16 inch screen has less height to look at documents then the 15.4 inch screens
-the metal looking plastic going around the body makes it look cheap and may come loose over time

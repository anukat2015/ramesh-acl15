Title: We love this machine
Content:
We love this machine.  We have limited space and need to have both a coffee maker and a cappucino maker in that space.  We have had none of the difficulties that others mention.  But we did take the black plastic sleeve off of the frother and that has made a huge difference.  With it on we got bubbles.  Now we get great froth.  And if we pack the espresso well we get an excellent crema.  It is a $100 machine that makes both coffee and espresso.  It is not going to be like a $1000 Starbucks machine.  We set our expectations appropriately and were delighted.

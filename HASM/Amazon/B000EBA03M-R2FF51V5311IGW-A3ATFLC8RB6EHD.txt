Title: Good basic SLR camera
Content:
Very good SLR for the Beginner. The two lenses found good.. However in out door shooting - I found very tedious to change the lens.
Night shot pics also good.. Image stabilization will not work much in night shot. Better have a tripod.
Over all - comparing price & feature - it's a very good camera..

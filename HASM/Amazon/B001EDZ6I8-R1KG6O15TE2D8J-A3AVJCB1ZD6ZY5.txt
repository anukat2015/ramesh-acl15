Title: Time for toasty toes
Content:
Sitting on my cold feet was doing nothing for my circulation or my posture.  My husband gave me this heated footrest for a birthday present and it's one of the best gifts I've gotten (well, except for the kitten that one year) to keep my feet warm.  
The angled footrest insures good posture at your desk, which also helps with back and body fatigue.  The nubby, bumpy surface helps with a passive massage and I think may even help with circulation.  
The heater doesn't get precisely hot even on the warmest temps, but used while wearing socks, it does keep my feet warm and comfortable even on the coldest days.  
One feature I really like is the 4 hour safety shut-off.  No worries about whether I turned the heater off or not and that makes me feel better about using it.  
One thing about Vornado products overall is that they last.  We have fans still in use that we purchased 10 years ago.  A space heater from last year is still giving good service when another more powerful model from another manufacturer has not held up.  Vornado does not make throw-away products.  Bless them for that in this economy!

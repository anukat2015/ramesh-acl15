Title: works for me
Content:
This is the best iPod in my opinion, since it is small enough to take anywhere, including the gym, and it has a screen, which makes it easy to navigate though your music collection.  I am a big fan of the Shuffle, but like having the screen, so this is a good compromise for me, since I don't want to carry around a huge iPod everywhere I go.
If you are an "active" person and use your iPod in the gym, while running, or doing anything like that, this or the Shuffle are the way to go, depending on whether or not you need a screen.
As with all iPods, the controls are intuitive.  You can operate this without reading the manual.  Even if you read the manual, it will take you about 3 minutes.  That's how simple everything is.
Also, if you have a Mac, and I am assuming a PC, you can "plug and play" with your computer.  Works great with iTunes or the Amazon mp3 store.  So easy my mother could do it!

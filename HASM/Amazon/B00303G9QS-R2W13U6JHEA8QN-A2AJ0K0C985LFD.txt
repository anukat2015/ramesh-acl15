Title: Typo, I presume?
Content:
I admittedly do not own this model of laptop.  I write solely to point out that I really hope there's a typo in the specifications because, currently, Amazon says this laptop has an 802.11B wireless card.  Not a/b/g/n or b/g/n, just B.
Please either fix it, or don't sell this model.

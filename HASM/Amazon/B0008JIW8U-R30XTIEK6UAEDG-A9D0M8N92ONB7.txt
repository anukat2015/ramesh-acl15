Title: Good at first - weak coffee after three months
Content:
Well, I've been using it for about 3 months now and it's been great. No complaints at all. But all of a sudden the coffee is coming out really weak.  Even putting in double the amount of coffee didn't really do anything for the strength.  I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!  DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS UNIT.  SPEND A LITTLE MORE $$$  FOR SOMETHING BETTER,

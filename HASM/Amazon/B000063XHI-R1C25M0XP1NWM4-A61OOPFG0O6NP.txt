Title: arrived broken
Content:
The Capresso is a wonderful machine--makes great coffee. I have owned several.  The one I ordered from Amazon however arrived in a box that was badly packed--very little paper around the box in a larger box.  AS a result the first time I used the machine, it leaked all over my counter and wooden floor. 
I will never order anything like this from Amazon again--they can pack books and cd's and dvd's but seemingly have no idea how to pack a coffee maker in order to have it arrive intact. 
The only good thing about this situation is that they said they would refund my money--however the credit has not yet appeared on my credit card.
Be warned.

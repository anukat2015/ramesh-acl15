The iPod is something that is known world-wide, and with good reason! 
 The iPod Shuffle is the second edition in the iPod family, and is extrodonary! Sure, it can't hold thousands of songs like the origonal, but do people even need to hold a thousand songs? I don't even know a thousand songs. 120 is more in the range of a normal persons liking for song capacity(or at least mine).
 The size is mighty small, as it's said above, 'as small as a pack of gum, but with more fun!', I like the size sure, but if you keep something as small as a pack of gum for more than a year, it might get lost. Then agian, no one likes carring around a big cd player.
 Theres about 3 feet of the earphone cord, and well I'm not a metric ruler, but I'd say the earphone is 1/2 of an inch.
 Downloading songs from iTunes is pretty simple, you can look at the top 100 songs downloaded from people all over the world, even listen to 30 seconds of any song you find, or you could buy and download to you iPod for 99 cents.
 The one thing I don't like about it is that for some of my songs, it skips in the beginning for about one second, but thats just mine.

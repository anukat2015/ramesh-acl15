Title: Mr. Coffee Frappe Maker
Content:
I gave this five stars because of the simplicity of this maker.  It makes it nice in the morning to put together all the ingredients and then hit the button and let it do it's thing.    Just be on your toes because when it starts to blend it will suddenly start blending without warning.  It needs a ding or something a couple seconds before the blending starts.
I have to disagree with a previous someone who suggested to use less ice to prevent overflow out the top of the blending jar.  I used more ice than what they suggest in the blending jar and it worked great without any overflowing.  It makes the drink thicker.  This could all depend on the size of ice you are using.  Experiment to find what works best.
The first time I used the maker I added too much water in the top and there is a overflow in the back of the unit which spilled the excess water over the counter which was a nice surprise.  
This Frappe Maker is great for saving money if you are a daily Frappe drinker.  It takes about the same amount of time to make your Frappe as it takes to go through a coffee shop drive-through.    
I also ended up using 8-12 cup filters because that was all I had at the time and they worked great a bit overkill but it sure beats driving around looking for 4 cup filters.
UPDATE:   I have started to stop the maker after it gets done brewing the coffee and blending it manually by pressing the separate blend button myself.  This does help a lot since the maker will usually pulse about 5 times and each time it starts to blend that is when some will come out the top.  I just end up holding down the button once and have good results without any coming out the top.  Hope this helps!

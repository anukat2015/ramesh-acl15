Title: Hoping for better
Content:
I love my Zoji rice cooker, so when it was time to get a new coffee pot, I decided to get this conundrum.  It is a mix of really great things and really dumb things.
Great :
Makes a large pot of hot good tasting coffee
I can tell already that the pause and serve will not break anytime soon unlike every other pot I have owned
Easy to put in coffee and water, if you don't use the stinking carafe for water (see below).
Unbreakable Carafe
Awful :
I read all the reviews about how the lid to the carafe shreds hands so I screwed it on loosely and it still was locked solid after it heated up.  Turns out you only close it when you want coffee not to pour, you can leave it a few turns loose at all times... so OK, but I cut my hand on the damn thing.
The stinking pour spout is so small that it takes 30 seconds to pour a cup of coffee.   I tend to unscrew the cap and dump coffee out of the big opening.  This is nearly unacceptable.
Size 3 filters (got scissors?) I was warned, but my leftover 4's don't fit very well after cutting them.
The clock and controls feel cheap which is so unlike my rice cooker although now that I think about it, there is no way to turn the rice cooker off (you have to unplug it).
I wouldn't buy this again.

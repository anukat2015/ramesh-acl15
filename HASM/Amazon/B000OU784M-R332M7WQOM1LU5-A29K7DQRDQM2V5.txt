Title: decent player but requires patience
Content:
Originally, I bought this as gift for someone who had never owned a mp3 player. I was a little worried about how good the quality was going to be for such a relatively cheap price. But I was impressed by the sleek visual design and the crisp sounds that the player provided when I listened to music. 
However, I soon decided that the player would frustrate someone who was not familiar with how mp3 players work in general. It literally took days before the player would fully charge and I still find it more difficult than it should be to work the touchpad and turn the player off. It takes numerous tries before I can get to my designated menu and I'm now only beginning figure out how to access the album feature.
Ultimately, I decided to purchase the Philips Go Gear Vibe as a gift for a few dollars more because frankly it's much easier to figure out for a first time mp3 user. However, I kept this player for myself to listen to while I work out and really can't complain too much for such a low price. It requires more patience than other players. But once you get it working, the music comes through clearly and so does the radio.

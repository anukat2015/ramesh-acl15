Title: Great Product that Requires A LOT of Charge
Content:
This is a wonderful ipod -- the display is really clear and it is very easy to navigate all the many options. It's just that the Bose doesn't charge this generation and it needs to be charged after playing about 50 songs. We got a separate charger and put it in every night, and that works. Overall, it's definitely worth the upgrade.

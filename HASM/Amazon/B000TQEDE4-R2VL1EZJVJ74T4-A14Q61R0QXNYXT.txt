Title: Great coffee maker
Content:
I am very happy with this product. It is the best coffee maker I have owned. It is solid and feels like it will last a long time, unlike the cheap junk I have owned in recent years. I love that it has a carafe and turns itself off. It is easy to use and clean. Yes, you must unscrew the top to get the last drops, but so what! It keeps coffee hot for about two hours and very warm for two more.

Title: Great heater for its size and power
Content:
I just received this heater today, so I'm not 100% sure about it yet. 
Yes, this heater doesn't heat up as well as the bigger, pricier models because it's small and only uses 300watts. However, I think the heat it emits is almost comparable to the fan heater my roomate uses which uses 1500watts, 5x the power of this little heater. I think if I had 5 of these little ones, the room would become ~3x warmer than with the fan heater. 
Pros:
-It's good for warming your feet and hands quickly
-It's very portable
-only 300watts (efficient for its power usage)
-good price
Cons:
-Has a bit of a gaseous smell that my other roomate's dish heater doesn't emit...maybe because this one is so new?
-Only a small area gets heated up
Overall, I'm happy with it.

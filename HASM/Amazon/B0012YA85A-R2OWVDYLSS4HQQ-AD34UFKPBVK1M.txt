Title: Great features don't mean a thing if it's out of focus
Content:
This camera has great features and I really liked it.  But unfortunately I had to return it because like many out there, all of my photos were slightly out of focus.  I ended up purchasing the Canon Digital Rebel XS instead.  I lost a few things, but it was worth it.  The XS takes great photos and for the same price I was able to get the camera kit plus an additional 75-300 lens.

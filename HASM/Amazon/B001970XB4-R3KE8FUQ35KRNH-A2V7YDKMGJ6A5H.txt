Title: Freeze-up special
Content:
Had the Coby MP835-4GB for a couple of months, and while at first is was OK, now it needs to be reset constantly, so much so that I have to carry a paper clip with me at all times.  Screen freezes up and is unresponsive.
Latest problem was that it would not even reset this morning, so the unit is going back to Coby since it is beyond the Amazon return time of 30 days.
If you buy any COBY products- be sure to send them back at the first sign of trouble- things won't get better!   The Coby website is just about useless, they have no firmware upgrades, and in fact don't even list this model anymore.   Yet Amazon continues to sell it, even though the replacement Coby model, the MP836, sells for a lower cost.

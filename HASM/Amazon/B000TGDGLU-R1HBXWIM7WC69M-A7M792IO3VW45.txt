Title: Well Built and Keeps Area Warm
Content:
The DeLonghi Oil-filled Radiator with ComforTemp Technology is a fine heater for small areas like bedrooms. I purchased one for mine. My apartment is on the 2nd flr. at the end of the bldg.and I have very little heat because the windows are not insulated. I put my new heater in there and all I have to set it to is on minimum with the dial on 2 or 3, close the door for awhile and it's nice and warm. I'd recommend this heater to anyone. It's worth every penny!

Content:
LOVE my single-serve Keurig coffemaker!  A variety of k-cups available from a variety of manufacturers at very reasonable prices & also like the choice of 3 different 'serving' sizes .... handy for if I'm making a morning mug or evening latte.  Have had my machine for 6 months - has always worked perfectly 'on demand'.  I also use it to brew tea & make single-serve cocoa! Easy to use and makes Great beverages quickly.

Title: Best Vacume for the Price
Content:
This vacume is the best I have ever owned.  Cleans awesome, very powerful suction, and you can detach the canister to clean ceiling fans & hard to reach areas.  It powers itself off if filter is dirty to prevent overheating and damage to motor which is how my last vacume died.  You can remove and clean every part on the vacume including filters and tank.  Simply the best vacume on the market for the price.

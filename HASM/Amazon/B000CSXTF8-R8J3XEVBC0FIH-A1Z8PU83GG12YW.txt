Title: Ridiculously Loud!!
Content:
We bought this for our daughters room.  It get's very hot in our upstairs during the summer.  It is so outrageously loud I can't believe it.  If you ever used an air compressor for in home construction; it sounds like there is one sitting in her room.  Amazingly she seems to be able to sleep through it, but I don't know how.

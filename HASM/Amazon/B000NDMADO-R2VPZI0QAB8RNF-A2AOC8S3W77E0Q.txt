Title: Dyson does not honor warranty!
Content:
This vacuum is all plastic and some of the connecting pieces are rather small. After 2 years, mine developed a slight crack. Unfortunately, the crack is in a place that prevents the dust bin part from fitting securely on top of the HEPA filter. Dyson will not repair the vacuum as their designated service center in my area says they have never heard of a Dyson cracking (search the internet for proof to the contrary!) and I must have "misused" it.
The warranty sounds good on paper but good luck getting Dyson to honor it. I wish I'd bought a different brand.

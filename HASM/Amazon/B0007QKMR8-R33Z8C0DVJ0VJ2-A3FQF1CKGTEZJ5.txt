Title: Major drawback in LCD screen
Content:
I was so excited to get this as my first SLR camera, it was very affordable and had so many features... however, I didn't realize that you could not use the LCD screen as a viewfinder. You have to look through the tiny viewfinder to see your picture before you take it. Then you can view the pictures taken via the LCD screen. Major drawback for me. I will be returning it and buying a different camera that allows for LCD viewfinder usage.

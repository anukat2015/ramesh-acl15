Title: unsatisfied
Content:
oneCall was very courtious, after I received the camera a Onecall rep followed up and called (very polite) to asked was I satisfied with the camera, but I informed them that hadn't tested it yet. when I did test the camera it didn't work, I called Onecall since it was within 30 days I was instructed to return the product for a full refund (minus shipping cost) I prepared the return package, before I placed the camera in the return package, I took the cam to an experienced Nikon user to test and it still didn't work, so immidiately I placed the cam in the return package and sent it back, I forgot to retrieve my 1 gig of secure digital memory from the camera. 
the reason I"m unsatisfied- when I called OneCall to see if they received the returned cam, 
1. their test found no defect in the cam, true or untrue.
2. shipping cost amounted to $40.00, camera defected.
3. OneCall claimed no memory card was locate.
three days later I bought the same model elsewhere and it works fine.

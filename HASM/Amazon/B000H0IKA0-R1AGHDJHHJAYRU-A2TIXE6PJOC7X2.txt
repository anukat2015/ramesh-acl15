Title: Technically challenged?  The ipod shuffle is the gadget for you!
Content:
I confess, I am technically challenged.  I've held off getting an ipod because I thought I would never be able to figure out how to use it.  Well the introduction of this new shuffle and the thought of having all that music in that tiny little clip-on was too much to resist.
Well I got one for Christmas and just looking at that tiny thing was fun.  Apple did a great job of packaging it in a nifty clear plastic box.  The instructions couldn't be easier and they include a little cheat sheet that you can carry with you until you get the hang of it.
The software was easily downloaded even for someone like me.  Charging the shuffle takes a few hours and it simply plugs into your USB port on your computer.  I tackled all that last night.
Today I decided to download some tunes off a CD into the ipod via the Itunes software.  It couldn't have been easier.  Plug in the ipod to the computer, slip a CD into the computer, load it, and then drag and drop the songs you want into your ipod.
I am rocking to the songs I downloaded as I type this review!  It was that simple, fast and easy.
A couple of things of note; the sound is very good, and if you are not an audiophile, you will more than likely be quite happy.  The ear buds (while not my favorite, I prefer headphones) fit fairly comfortably although please note they include a package of two sets of covers but are not marked as such.  That being said, the covers are pretty delicate and you'll have to be careful putting them on the buds.
I am sure there is still a lot to learn about my shuffle, but so far the learning curve has been very fast and easy.  I love being in the 21st century!

Title: Great 10 cup coffee maker
Content:
This my first Zojirushi product, ( I can't even pronounce the name). Also it is my first thermal carafe maker. I gave it a four only because the #4 filters do not fit the basket, and they did not include a permanet filter that does fit. It seems to take a three size filter, but I have never seen a #3.?
The Zojirushi is one fast coffee maker. Its gets the water to the perfect tempture very fast. I grind my coffee and its very important for the water temp. to be correct, atleast to me it is. Pricey? YES, Worth it YES.

Title: Love it...
Content:
This vacuum is compact, but powerful. I had a Dyson Animal (an excellent machine) that I gave to my cousin when I went from carpet to hardwoods. The Hoover is much more effective on the hardwoods as well as the ceramics and vinyls. I love it. It has basically the same kind of system as the Dyson and you simply pop out the canister to empty the dust and dirt you've collected. Three features I find more appealing than the Dysons: the cord automatically rewinds into the body of the canister, the machine is easier to carry around the house and it is easier to store if you have limited closet space. It's also much less expensive!

Title: zune
Content:
The zune is good for ease of use and playing videos and such cause you do not have to go through all the different conversions like with the pod. in the hand it is also more sensitive to the touch for scrolling and such, but I think it is also less rugged. I got two for friends and they both got broken super quick. also the software support does not have data for many song yet unlike ipod, but since the zune is fairly new I expect these are growing pains which will be resolved soon enough. plus you can listen to the radio with no extra equipment.

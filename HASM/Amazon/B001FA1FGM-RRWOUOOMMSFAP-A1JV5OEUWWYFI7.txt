Title: Worst heater ever!
Content:
I purchased this heater at my local Big Chain Home Improvement Store. After getting home I turned it on and found that it put out little heat. I took out my digital thermometer and found that at 4 feet away, the temperature only rose by 2.5 degrees! And that's on the 85 setting! I thought it might be a bad unit so I took it back and exchanged it for another unit. Upon returning home I found that this one was also ineffective. It only raised the temperature by 2 degrees! What a piece of junk! Don't buy this product!

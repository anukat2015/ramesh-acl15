Title: Excellent little laptop
Content:
I've had mine for a day now and so far so good.  It was packaged well, the box was in great condition, and the machine powered right up.  I'm not a big fan of Vista, so I ordered the free upgrade to Windows 7 32-bit.  
Thoughts:
- Boots up surprisingly fast.  Faster than my far more powerful Windows 7 HTPC.
- Comes loaded with a lot of garbage software.  Truly useless stuff.  I've uninstalled half of it but there's still quite a few to go.  
- Before ordering I read a number of bad reviews about the keyboard.  I was worried before I received the machine, but my fears proved to be wasted energy.  I have absolutely no issues with the keyboard at all after putting it through it's paces.
- Battery life seems pretty good.  Looks like it will average about six hours per charge, just as advertised.
- Quality seems to be on par with other laptops in this price range.  No issues with my unit at all.
- The integrated graphics chip is a little better than I thought it would be.  I downloaded the Half Life 2 demo off of Steam to test it out and it ran like a champ at it's native resolution.  This makes me pretty confident that this machine will be able to play most games from five years ago and back, which was unexpected at this price range.  Low settings might be needed, but still, it's nice to be able to game when desired.
- Watched a few video clips in Windows Media Player and listened to some music.  Everything ran fine.  The speakers sound about as good as you can expect at this size and price range (decent).
- This laptop picked my WiFi network up without much hassle.  Setup with my router took all of five minutes.  Picks up the signal without interruption in every area of my apartment.
Note:  I bought my unit off of Amazon on Thanksgiving Day for $299 ($289 after Discover Card discount applied).  At that price this thing is a steal.  At it's regular price ($400 - $450) I'd say it's very competitive with other laptops with a comparable feature set.
Definitely recommended.

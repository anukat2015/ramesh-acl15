Title: It's pretty good...
Content:
I've owned the Ibiza for a few months now, and I really do like it. The only things that I don't like is sometimes the interface feels to simple and there aren't that many advanced options offered, like custom EQ. The other problem I've had with it is that it seems to be hard to keep a wireless connection. I can be in the same room as my wireless router and the connection will drop quite easily. Taking the rubber protective case off helps with the connection, but it still seems like it should be better, and I shouldn't have to remove the rubber case. I really do like the product over all and I would recommend it. I just wish the wireless didnt drop so much.

Title: Very pleased!
Content:
I am very pleased with this coffee machine.  I looked at getting a Keurig or the Nes dolce gusto' machine, but they couldn't match up to this in my opinion.  The machine is quiet when brewing, brews very hot, and is simple and clean to use.  The coffee it makes is great (starbucks, seattles best, and Gevalia).  The latte t-discs aren't very good, but i'm sure they will make approvements.  Highly recommended for someone living alone or an occasional drinker.

Title: Garbage
Content:
I've owned three of these so far, and each one needed to be returned for the same reason: The player would simply freeze up and stop working on me. 
The player itself is decent looking, if not a bit plain. The sound quality is nice, but nothing you won't find anywhere else. However, the software that comes with the Zen is difficult to use and the hardware is absolute trash. And the update on Creative's website did nothing to fix the problem (How stupid is it that I have to update the thing manually on their website?).
I did not pay over one hundred dollars for a brick, Creative!

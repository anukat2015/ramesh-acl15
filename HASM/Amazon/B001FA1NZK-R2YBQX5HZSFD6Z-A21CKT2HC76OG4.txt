Title: Met Expectations
Content:
Having owned an iPod nano (both 2nd gen and 3rd gen), I was looking for a complementary iPod that would hold more music. The iPod touch seemed like a more exciting choice than the iPod classic, especially given that it's like having a internet service in your pocket, and all the features looked incredible. And having used it for two weeks, I'm very pleased with the product so far. 
The touch screen works great, dimming if not in use for a minute's time, and the image, aside from occasional smudges, is extremely bright and crisp; it's plenty bright enough on a low setting. In some websites on Safari, the touch screen interactivity can be inconsistent (zooming in on text takes a few tries sometimes), but I love turning it on its side to get a landscape view. This same function is fantastic for using your iTunes library, changing the information depending on how you hold the iPod touch. 
You can basically customize the iPod touch through the app store. I've been on the hunt for the most useful free applications, such as google earth, flikster, units, i.TV, and instapaper, and high quality and fun games, like Trism, SPiN, Snail Mail, and Asphalt 4. As long as you do some research, you'll find the treasures in the store amid all the junk.  
The 16 GB is plenty of storage space for me; under the settings menu on the iPod touch, it tells me I still have 3GB available, and it is holding 1909 songs, 114 videos (many of those are very short), and 85 photos. So I think if you have a need to put over 3000 songs on an iPod, go with the iPod classic. Otherwise, any size iPod touch is the best choice as an alternative to the nano.

Title: Worst product ever
Content:
This is the most frustrating product I have ever used. The strength of the heat produced is weak, but worst of all the fan falls down ALL the time seemingly in response to ANY touch. It was not made to stand firmly at all. I use it at night, in the dark, and if I have to feel around to find something you can bet that I'm going to barely, almost touch this thing and its going to fall over and knock over a bunch of other things on its way down. Die in a fire, Holmes heater.

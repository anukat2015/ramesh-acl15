Title: What were they thinking at Cuisinart?
Content:
This coffee maker should be taken off the market and redesigned. There are so many marts that it is very easy to make a mistake, forget one part and make a huge mess, with coffee spilling down the counter and onto the floor. For example, if you clean the filter basket and put it back in place, you better remember to place the paper filter in place because if you forget the mess is guaranteed. Also, make sure the filter basket is tightly secured and latched, because if it is not, again coffee grinds and liquid is giong to go all over the place and make a huge mess. 
The noise from the grinder is ridiculous. The caraf must be closed with the top secured in only one position, because if the beak is not perfectly perpendicular coffee spills all over.
It is a VERY poorly designed machine

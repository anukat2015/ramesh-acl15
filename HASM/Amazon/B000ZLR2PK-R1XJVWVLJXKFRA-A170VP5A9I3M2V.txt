Title: Dirt Devil 082550 Breeze Bagless Canister Vacuum Cleaner with Power Nozzle
Content:
This vacuum cleaner is a great value if you prefer a canister style vacuum. It has a lot of power and works well. It is lightweight and has an awsome shoulder strap. The only drawback to this model is that there is an external powercord from the machine to the power nozzle, and if you want to disconnect the power nozzle and use another attachment, it is fairly cumbersome to unhook the power cord. But I am happy to live with that drawback for this machine's great performance value ratio.

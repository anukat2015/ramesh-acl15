Title: nice mp3 player
Content:
I needed a new mp3 player and got this based on a sale email which came through.  A bit hesitant about it, since I previously had an iPod and loved it, but the price was good though that I decided to take a chance on it.  Glad I did.  This is a nice little (well, not so little) mp3 player, about the size of the original iPod.  Good color display.  Also love that it has an FM radio, which you can record.  Works with Audible, which is nice for people who use that service.

Title: Very good vacuum
Content:
Am very pleased with the overall performance of this vacuum.  There are a couple of little things not pleasing.  Dusting brush is not very good and the way it is attached to the handle causes air to blow back at you.  Also the attachment of the wall/floor brush is awkward.  Had to go to a Hoover place to show us how to attach it.  Guess I can live with this, but feel the company should be able to correct both items.

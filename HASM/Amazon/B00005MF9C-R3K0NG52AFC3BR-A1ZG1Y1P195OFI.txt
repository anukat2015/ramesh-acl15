Title: Affordable Product Brews GREAT Coffee
Content:
I bought this product several months ago, when I decided to limit my coffee consumption to one GREAT mug per day. Not only does this coffee brew my favorite Starbuck's variety quickly and well, but the mug lid fits tightly (and I've accidentally knocked it over more than once), and it fits in my car beverage holder. It cleans up very easily (another big plus for speed), and is unobtrusive on the countertop. And it's a steal. Better than I could have hoped for at this price.

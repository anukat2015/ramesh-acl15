Title: Defective Motherboard
Content:
The HP PC's are TRASH in my opinion. I bought the DV6226US in March 2007, and my System Board fried just 7-1/2 months later. They replaced it, and 8 months later if fried again - and HP wouldn't cover it. With the excessive heat no wonder! A system board crashing is rare but 2 boards in 16 months is nothing but defective product - pure and simple. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT

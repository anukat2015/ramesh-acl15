Title: it depend on your use for it
Content:
If your using this computer strictly for the internet there are advantages and disavantages it is not good with aol just like all macs thats all i can say.If you are intrested in aol i HIGHLY recomend ibm by all means .There are advantages though mac has a airport which is a very convienent wireless modem btu does not work aol.I own the ibook and  a ibm and i love aol and mac just doesnt compare to a ibm with that.If you prefer mac then this is a good choice.There are better mac laptops out there but this is great.Its a little heavy but the handle is very supportive and trusty.the speed is preety fast.as you probalby know mac doesnt allow downloading any window programs unless you buy the make your mac compatible to windows program thing.The imovie is great.It does not come with games such as solitare or anything that would come with an ibm comp. and its a little  unconvienent looking for software in mac all the time.There is alot of room to rest your palms which i like.But jsut like all laptops u must be very careful with the charger ive broken mine previously without even being rough and they are exspensive to replace.I like the computer but it realy does depend on your use for it

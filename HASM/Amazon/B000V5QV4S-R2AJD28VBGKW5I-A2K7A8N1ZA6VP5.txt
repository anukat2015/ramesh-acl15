Title: Good camera
Content:
This is a good product. I own one. I used it for shooting landscapes and travel. I bought this item because it suffice my need for shooting this type of photography. It has a good built and its perfect for my hands. Since I've been shooting in extreme conditions this is perfect because of its build. I also love the dial because I can easily navigate to my photos and swith to different menus. I like the 6 frames per second its fast enought for sports photograpy. For its price I highly recommend this camera you won't regret it.

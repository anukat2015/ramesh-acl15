Title: iPod touch 8Gig w/o update
Content:
My fiance and I bought iPod touches at the same time and we both LOVE them.  Wouldn't trade it for any other mp3 player.  The only thing that sucks is having to spend an additional 20 bucks to get the upgrade, but it is worth it.  We have reccomended this product to all our friends.  Everyone that has tried ours have felt the same about them as we have.

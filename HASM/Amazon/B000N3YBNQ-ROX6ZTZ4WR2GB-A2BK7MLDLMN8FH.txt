Title: Electrolux  Intensity Vacuum
Content:
Since purchasing the Electrolux Intensity vacuum cleaner I have vacuumed more
often than with any vacuum cleaner I have owned.  It is so easy to take out, carry
around and operate.  I like the controls high on the handle to change from 
bare floor to carpet cleaning in an instant.  It does a good job of cleaning
the floors.  The only drawback is that it does not fit under furniture.  Other 
than that, I am completely satisfied with this vacuum cleaner and would 
recommend it to anyone.

Title: Krups Death Spiral
Content:
This is my fourth Krups coffemaker in 20 years.  The first was a 10-cupper that was a wedding gift and it soldiered on for 12 years.  Upon its demise, a new Krups 12 cup unit with a built-in clock filled its countertop spot. About four years into its service it died without a blink or a peep.  Krups replaced that one because it had been recalled, so I was happy.  That one worked until recently.  Hence, we purchased this most current Krups.  I give it two years max.  The carafe is made of the thinnest glass imaginable.  The lid is hinged with these tiny soon-to-be-broken plastic tips, and it does not stay open unassisted.  The water-level indicator is useless as it fills with equal amounts of water and air bubbles.  The shape of the carafe is such that as you are pouring out the last bit of its delicious coffee your knuckles are scalded with hot coffee vapor.
Krups used to be the BMW of the small appliance world -- intelligently and over engineered German stuff that worked extremely well, lasted a long time, and looked cool.  For that you paid a healthy premium over what you would have paid Mr. Coffee or Ms. Proctor Silex.  You couldn't find this stuff in the various X-Marts, no, you had to go to Macy's (later, Amazon).  Now, Macy's is phasing them out and they are probably made in the same Sino-Walmart lowest-bidder factories as the lead-coated Barbies and Thomas the Tank Engine geegaws.  But, they are still priced higher than a Mr. Coffee!
Krups, sorry to see you go.  Bean counted to irrelevance.

Title: New Mac convert
Content:
I've been using Windows based computers for a little while now, and they've given me nothing but headaches. SO I decided that it was time to upgrade to something new and more reliable. I'm writing this review from the apple right now and I have to say I am enjoying it very much. It is definitely pretty to look at. I was at a coffee shop earlier and I got second glances from everyone. That aside, this thing seems to be pretty sturdy and powerful. It has had a couple of minor hiccups though...but what I like about it is that the hardware isn't affected if there's a glitch in the software. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

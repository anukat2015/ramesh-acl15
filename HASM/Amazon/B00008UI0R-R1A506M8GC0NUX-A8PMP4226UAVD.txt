Title: DON'T buy this vacuum
Content:
There's a reason why they sell this product with the ad: 
"Better Together. Buy this item with Hoover Agitator Belt today!"
I purchased this vacuum in late 2007 after reading most of the Amazon product reviews. None of the reviews  mentioned that the belt comes off OFTEN. I have taken it in for service twice. I was told that the belt comes off when using it to vacuum wool rugs and animal fur. I was also advised to use the "low" suction when doing so.
Certainly not pet-owner-friendly. Get yourself a Dyson.

Title: Best coffee maker ever!
Content:
I love this coffee maker, because I hate brewed coffee that's more than 30 minutes old. The Keurig B-70 is very nice cause it meets my coffee drinking needs. Fast...makes large travel cup size, can use your own beans with the reusable K-cup and the coffee always taste fresh and great! I think I'm saving money cause I'm no longer dumping half a pot of coffee to make a fresh pot.

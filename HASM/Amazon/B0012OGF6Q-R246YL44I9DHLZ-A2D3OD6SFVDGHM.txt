Title: Pleased with camera; first digital SLR experience
Content:
I've had the camera several weeks now and have used it a number of times.  Although I've used a regular SLR for years, the D60 was my first time to use a digital SLR.  So far, the controls seem to be pretty intuitive, the auto-focus has worked better than expected, and the clarity of the pictures has been fantastic.  I'm very pleased with the camera.

Content:
The other reviews cover all the specific details. I will just say that I am satisfied with this purchase. It works quite well. I didn't really have the odor problem mentioned in another review. It did give off a bit of a chemical scent during the first 10-15 minutes I used it but since then, nothing noticeable.
One small annoyance for me - you are always tied into the timer. If you just want to flip it on, you have to make sure the timer is set for it to be on at that time. It has switched off before I want it to because the timer ticked over to an OFF time. Just an annoyance, I still recommend this product.
This is a solid metal object. The wheels and controls are plastic, a little flimsey, but the overall feeling is of quality. It's a good buy.

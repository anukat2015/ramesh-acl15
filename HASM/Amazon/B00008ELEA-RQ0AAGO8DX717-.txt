Title: They don't last long enough
Content:
I have gone through six of these pots in four years.  I just bought another one.  The old one lasted nine months.  Someone in my house insists on having these coffepots, so I keep buying them.  They make good perked coffee, but just don't have any longevity.  It's too much trouble and costly to mail them back to the manufacturer.  I have had numerous different problems, the most common being that they burn out. On one pot, the cord socket fell apart after a few months.

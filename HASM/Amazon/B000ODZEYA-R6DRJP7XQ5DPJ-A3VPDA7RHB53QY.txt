Title: Best audiobook Player- smallest version.
Content:
This is the best audiobook player. I also have an Ipod 80GB Classic and had a Zen Vision M. It leaves both for dead. 
- superb sound quality. 
- excellent bookmark function- 256 bookmarks. It returns to the bookmark and continues to the follwing tracks (unlike Zen which just stops, as do many other players, and windows mobile players). 
- the touch screen is very nifty and the smart menus pop up nicely. Navigation quickly became intuitive.  
- the standard folder structure makes loading books and tracks very simple. I am over Itunes and do not miss it. 
- 16GB or 8GB or 4GB of internal memory, then an SD slot which means you can have as many SD cards as you want. bookmarks work on the current SD card no worries. 
- excellent for music albums. 
- the video function works well when I test it, although I am not interested in using it routinely.
If you're looking for the best portable audiobook player, you've found it. But if you just want to listen to audiobooks on your computer get ViddyMP3 for free. Or if you want to tinker get Rockbox free software for various portable players. I think the D2 is great for music too as its sound is clearly superior to Ipod and Zen to even my untrained ear. 
It does not do playlists, but really who needs them? I mainly used to use them to work around Itunes bugs.(maybe I like compilation albums, but I can just compile a folder of MP3's any way I like). 
Wishlist- on the fly erase & click for more details on the bookmarks (but still the best for bookmarks), playlists (OK already). 
Tips- use the stylus supplied for navigating the touch screen. 
- when you first ever turn it on, be careful as the first thing you do is set language and I accidentally clicked Korean!! It took a while to return it to English, ha ha. 
- If you're not sure just buy the 4GB Black version [...], and later expand it with an SD card.
Note that Cowon also make the S9 which I have not seen. It is more expensive and uses a different screen technology.

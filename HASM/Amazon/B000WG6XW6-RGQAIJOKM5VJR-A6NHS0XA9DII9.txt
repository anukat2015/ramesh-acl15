Title: Piece of Crap
Content:
This product will not work on Microsoft Media Center 2002, which I got with a new Dell PC just 2 years 4 months ago.  Essentially Microsoft has designed a product which will not work with many versions of their own software.
You must have Microsoft Media Center 2005 to use it - which they don't tell you any place.

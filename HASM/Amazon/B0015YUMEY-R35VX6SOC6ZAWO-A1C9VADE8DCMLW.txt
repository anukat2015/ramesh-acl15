Title: Refurbished Macbook Pro 15" purchase
Content:
I got the laptop in good condition except the firewire connections didn't recognize my external hard drives. Now that's a bummer. Since the item was refurbished and not brand new, i immediately bought Apple Care to cover potential repair costs and it was a great decision because the logic board had to be replaced rightaway. But now i'm happily using it, so no complaints. Amazon's service was excellent, as usual.

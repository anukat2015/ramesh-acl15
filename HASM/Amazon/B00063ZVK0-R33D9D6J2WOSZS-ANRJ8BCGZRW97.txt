Title: Not reliable
Content:
When I first got the heater it worked fine.  It's small and heats a room well and on low it is quiet.  However, after only using it 3 or 4 times it broke.  The fan would not turn on.  It seems cheaply made for such an expensive product.  It is almost all plastic.  If you look at the reviews I am certainly not the only one who has had this heater break in this manner.

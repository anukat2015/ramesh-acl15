Title: Great Product
Content:
I've had the Creative Zen MicroPhoto for several months now, and I really enjoy it.  The color screen is great, and I like the options to put your own photos on it.  It's really easy to use, and I like it a lot more than any iPod.  The touch pad may be kinda tricky to get the hang of at first, but I found it best to just lower the scroll speed settings.  My only real complaint is that the software sometimes crashes on my computer.  I don't know if this is my computer's fault, but it still works about 85% of the time.

Title: i'm so confused
Content:
i've been researching mp3 and minidisc players for several months. i came across this one. it seems like a great buy but i'm a little confused. do you have to pay, like some players, to download music onto the player? can i use my own programs to download or do i have to use the software included? my big thing, once again, is do i have to pay to download. and one more thing. maybe i'm just missing this info somewhere but does the lcd screen light up? does it display song titles? please help anyone. display the answers in your review. thanks

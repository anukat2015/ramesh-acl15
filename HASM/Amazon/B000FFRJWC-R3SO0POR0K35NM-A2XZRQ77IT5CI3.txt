Title: Love it
Content:
I haven't had any problems at all with my Eureka Uno. In fact, I love it. It has excellent suction and practically propels itself. I bought it as a Christmas giftie to me, so I've had it about 6 months now. I have two dogs, so I vacuum daily. It is meeting the challenge nicely. I'm a very satisfied customer.

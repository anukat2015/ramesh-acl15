Title: DMC-L1 7.5MP Lumix digital camera
Content:
I deleted my 3 star review after Panasonic's Service Center sent me a new lens when the Elmarit Zoom on my Lumix started to jam. Now they have sent the camera and lens back and I am happier with the camera.  This camera isn't an giant megapixel SLR with the finest lens. It has an amazing lens for the money and it takes great pictures.

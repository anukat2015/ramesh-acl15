Title: Delonghi TRD 0715T Oil-filled Radiator
Content:
I recently purchased three Delonghi TRD 0715T Safe Heat oil-filled Radiator.I love these Radiators'they are built solid, you don't have to worry about them over heating. The frames on these Radiators are solid and well built (like old time radiators were). I also have a Delonghi Radiator nineteen years old and one that is ten years old.I have never had any problems with my two older heaters.
With the winters becoming so bitter at night and the heating bills being so high! It has really helped out with keeping the furnace turned down and putting these heaters in the bedrooms to keep them warm. You can't go wrong with Delonghi products, excellent products and excellent prices.

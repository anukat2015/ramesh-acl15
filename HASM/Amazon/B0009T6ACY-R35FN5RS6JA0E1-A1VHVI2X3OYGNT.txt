Title: Defective - noisy - doesn't cool 9000 BTU worth
Content:
I needed an air conditioner for an odd sized window, and thought this unit might be my answer.  Sadly, it was not.  For a month, I was pleased.  I questioned the "9,000 BTU" rating outside of a lab, since less-than-perfect heat venting lowers efficiency, but - hey! - it cooled my bedroom.  Then, the noise started.  The decibels rose until I was unable to talk on the telephone without shouting, much less sleep. When the unit quit completely, the mystery was solved.  The internal pump which ejects condensation through a hose had failed.  The compressor iced, the fan banged against the ice.  Now Frigidaire can't seem to come up with either a replacement unit, or parts. Bottom line - bad design.  Better than De Longhi, but still bad.  This is an great idea whose time has NOT come, until they get the bugs out.

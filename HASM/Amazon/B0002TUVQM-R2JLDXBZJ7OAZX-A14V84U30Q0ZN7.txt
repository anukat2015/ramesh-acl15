Title: Awesome cocoa maker
Content:
This thing is great.  It makes awesome cocoa and coffee drinks.  It's very easy to use and, contrary to what some here have said, clean up is a snap. You can't put it in the dishwasher but if you run water through it after each use it's fool proof.  Only one downside,I thought from the picture the base was brushed metal but it's only plastic painted to look like brushed metal.  That doesn't detract from it's utility it's just something I noticed. We are very happy with this purchase.

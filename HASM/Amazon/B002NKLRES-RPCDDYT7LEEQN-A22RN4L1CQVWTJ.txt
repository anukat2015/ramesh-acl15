Title: Better than I thought it would be!
Content:
The ease of use is great. I had read other reviews and got a little nervous, but the system shows that You can't believe everyone. THe only complaint I had is that IT IS NOT NAPSTER TO GO compatable. But with all the other good things that it does, it is way better than an ipod touch any day of the week.

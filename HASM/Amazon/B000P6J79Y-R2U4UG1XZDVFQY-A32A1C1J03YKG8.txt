Title: Decent Sports Player
Content:
Pros:
Small and light
Rugged
Sweat resistant
30 lap stopwatch memory
5 or so EQ presets
Included earbuds sound OK and stay in place. Earbuds/headphones are personal choice (I prefer headphones)
You get both a stretchy wrist and arm bands
Cons
Button pad is tough to use because it is small and therefore very easy to hit mulitple buttons at one time....especially while running.
The stopwatch will reset to 0 if you leave the stopwatch display to change volume or change tracks....frustrating!
Display is very small and tough to read especially when running
BMI calculator is a joke..  All it does is tell you if you're "Ideal" or  "Overweight" based upon your input height and weight
All in all, as an mp3 player strictly for working out or running, it is very good.  If you want an mp3 player where you can change volume and or tracks while the stopwatch is running, look elsewhere.  In fact, I just ordered a new Timex Ironman watch because of the issue with the stopwatch on this RCA S2002.

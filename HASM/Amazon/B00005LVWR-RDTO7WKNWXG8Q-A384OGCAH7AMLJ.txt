Title: great machine
Content:
My brother has one; he got it because my sister has one....so I had to get one - and I love it!!  Great machine and easy to clean.  I have to admit, though, after about a month of use and really loving the coffee, my wife asked me "Is it worth the money?"...the cost of this machine is very high compared with your standard 10 cup brewer, but I love it!  And if you can part with the $$, I'm sure you'd love it too.

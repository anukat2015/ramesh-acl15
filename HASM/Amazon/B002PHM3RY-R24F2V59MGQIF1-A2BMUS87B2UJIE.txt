Acer Aspire Timeline AS1810TZ-4174 11.6-Inch Blue Laptop - Over 8 Hours of Battery Life (Windows 7 Home Premium)
I normally do not do reviews, but I searched for a long time to find the perfect portable laptop.  I've bought 2 netbooks and have a 15.6 in laptop for work, but what i was looking for was a highly portable laptop that had the computing power to do all the things i needed.  this laptop works great.  win 7 has made almost everything very easy.  the laptop is lightweight, portable and has a sizable upgrade in processor, ram, and hd space over the 1410 series.  i know it's about 150 more than the celeron series acer, but this one has the bluetooth that i was looking for and can stream HD no problems.  Hulu, bluray movies, and other video work flawlessly.  the only downside is that the speakers are a little tinny and aren't that powerful, but i can't expect perfection for a laptop that is $200 less than the nearest competitor with similar specs.  also, the keyboard is a little light to the touch, so i end up making a lot more typing errors, but at least the keys are in the right places.  battery life has been good, with about 5-6 hours with heavy wifi and bluetooth usage.  
here's what i really like tho - the bluetooth.  i dont know what manufacturers are so quick to get rid of the bluetooth.  this one piece of hardware allows me to stream music to my bt headphones, use my bt mouse, and tether my phone to get bt wifi anywhere without a extra modem.  also, file transfer is much quicker than over my 802.11g router.  my advice is this, acer has taken out the bluetooth from all the newer models to come for q1 2010.  if you can get your hands on one of these laptops now, i would get it.  otherwise, you may have to look for a new manufacturer.

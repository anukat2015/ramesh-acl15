Title: Good, to a point
Content:
The good: this lightweight vacuum doesn't have any consumables (like bags). It has plenty of pull for light use on dry messes.
The not so good: This sucked up a dust-bunny just a bit bigger than it could swallow, and it choked. That blocked the one-way intake valve half open, and it threw up some of what it had swallowed earlier back onto the floor. Yuk.
The conclusion: Good, up to a point, but don't assume it will handle a car floor's worth of sand and grit. Save the heavy lifting for a bigger tool.
Update after using it a while longer: Downgraded from three to two stars. The darned thing clogs easily and is tedious to unclog. Dust-bunnies aren't the only offenders, but any house with animals that shed will want a tool with a wider throat.

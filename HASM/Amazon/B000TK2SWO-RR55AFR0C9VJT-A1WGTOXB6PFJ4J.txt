Title: Good build quality and quiet!
Content:
I have an attached single car garage that I primarily use as a workshop. The garage has been insulated and dry-walled. Initially I tried heating the garage with a propane heater that I had purchased previously for use while building my addition. It generated alot heat but was noisy and had to be vented. 
In doing my research, I quickly determined that an electric heater was going to be the most simple and least expensive solution for my needs. I am very comfortable with adding circuits (safely / to code) so the 240volt was outlet not too daunting. 
I liked the G73 because of the features (thermostat, low fan noise)and straight forward install. I found the reviews here on Amazon to very helpful, there is even some excellent pictures of an installed unit.
Once the unit arrived, it took me a couple of hours to install the circuit (fishing a cable into the basement back to the sub panel), in the end I chose to NOT hardwire it, but rather install a 240volt outlet in the garage, and installing a cord on the G73. This allowed for easy removal in the summer if I wanted to store it for some reason.
Once the unit was turned on, I was very pleased that it was able to quietly raise the temperature in the garage by nearly 15 degrees within the first hour. When I do leave it on overnight I just keep it around low, it keeps the garage around 60 degrees. 
The unit has been installed for roughly 4 weeks, I am very pleased with this purchase.

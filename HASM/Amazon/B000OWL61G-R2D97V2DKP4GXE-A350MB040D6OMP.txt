Title: Broke in less than a month
Content:
Received this as a Christmas gift per my request.  After 3 weeks of use - everything seemed fine so I tossed the box.  Now....it is January 31st and I have only gotten Err2 out of my coffee pot for a week.
This thing didn't last a month.
I never had the overflow problem with mine though.
Now I guess I start the tedious process of getting them to stand behind their product even though I don't have the box to send it back in....

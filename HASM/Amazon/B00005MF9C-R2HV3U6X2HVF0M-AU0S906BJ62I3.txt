Title: I love it - and am skeptical about the negative comments
Content:
So, before I bought this, I must've read every comment below.  Then, I bought it!
Positive Points from me and others:
- Makes one great cup in about 3 minutes.
- Shuts itself off once cup is brewed.
- Takes up very little space (could travel with this!)
- Comes with own reusable filter. (So, no trash, like with the K-cups.)
- Only clean-up is the filter - just rinse it out.
Negatives mentioned by others:
- Included travel cup is only "ok" - I've been using a regular ceramic mug when I'm just at home.
- Drips when you move filter basket - just leave your cup under there for a little more previous coffee!
- Overflowed often, making big mess - I humbly submit that this could be user error.  The coffee filter is very small (holds just enough for one cup) and the water tub is very small (again, only meant to hold enough to fill one coffee cup).  If you over-fill either one, I can see how you'd end up with water, coffee and/or grounds all over the counter.  But, with the right portions, it works beautifully.  
Hope this helps!

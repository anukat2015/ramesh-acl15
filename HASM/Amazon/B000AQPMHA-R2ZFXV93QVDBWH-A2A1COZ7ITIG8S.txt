Title: Don't buy this machine!!!!!
Content:
I bought a Keurig less than 2 years ago and it just died, by their own admission it should last longer but according to them the heating coil burned out and it is not replaceable. Their answer was to go buy a new one since their "warranty" is only 1 year.
Buy a more reliable product from a more reliable vendor!!!

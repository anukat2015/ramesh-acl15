Title: Excellent Product
Content:
For as long as I can remember my mom had a canister vacuum.  However, when I got married I received an upright.  For the last 11 months I have been using and have been really fustrated with the results.  Finally I gave up and bought this vacuum after reading all of the great reviews.  I would have to agree with them, this vacuum is wonderful!  It is so great to be able to use all of the attachments along with the varying levels of suction.  It really seems to get things very clean and it is very obvious when you see how much dirt you have sucked up and the difference in the vacuumed and the unvacuumed!  The only thing that I would like to change is the fact that not all of the attachments live on the canister.  Instead you have to pack them around with you.  Other than that, it does a wonderful job and suprising does not weigh too much!

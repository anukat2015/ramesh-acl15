Title: Love it
Content:
It is a dynamite laptop.  I have had no problems with it crashing or not running.  I shouldn't need to say that but my old WinXP laptop would do this constantly.  I did upgrade the memory to 4GB right away since it is so easy to do and much cheaper than having it factory installed.  I did also install VM Ware Fusion to allow me to run Windows only programs and it works great.  The set-up is really the best of both worlds, simplicity and reliability of Mac and compatability of Windows.
Highly recommended.

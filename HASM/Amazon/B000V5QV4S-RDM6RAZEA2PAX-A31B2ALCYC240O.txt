Title: Great Pre-Full Frame camera
Content:
We originally had the Canon XTi and decided to upgrade to the 40D.  As soon as we picked it up it was love at first shot.  It's slightly bigger in the grip but definitely pleasantly noticeable.  The large dial on the back also was a welcome change because on the XTi, F-Stop change required you to press a button and then roll the mini dial.  There are so many different "upgrades" to list.  My recommendation is that pass on the XTi and get this kit.  You get a huge break in price when you get the the lens together in this kit.  Have fun with it.

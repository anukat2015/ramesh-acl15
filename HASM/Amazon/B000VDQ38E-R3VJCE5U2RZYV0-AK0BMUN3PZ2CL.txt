Title: Just Go For It
Content:
I was a little concerned ordering something online that I had not seen before and it worked out great. The vacuum is a little big, but it is still easy to use. My one complaint is the hose, I am not sure what is going on with it but I have a hard time taking the hose off and sticking it back on with ease. Regardless, of the hose I think I got my monies worth ordering this vacuum.

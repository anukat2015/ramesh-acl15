Title: Eco-heater whole room heater review
Content:
I bought this product thinking I can use it in my bedroom without having to turn our central heater on overnight.  This turn out to be great.  I leave in CA bayarea where weather is not too extreme anyway.  My room is 12x14.  It does take about 30 minutes to heat up the room though.  Overall I like this product.

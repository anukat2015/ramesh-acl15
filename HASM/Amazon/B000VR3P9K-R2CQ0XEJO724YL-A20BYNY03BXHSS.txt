Title: Battery Life Galore! Now. . .I'm a MAC.
Content:
I just converted to a Mac Book Pro from a Sony Vaio.  What a difference!!  I've never had a laptop with such a long battery life which is key because I travel a lot for work.  It's also super light weight so it doesn't bog me down when I'm carrying all of my work stuff through airport security.  I've had it for about a month now and have not experienced even one single problem.  Transferring my files was a cinch, but it takes a minute to get used to the new operating system.  I watch movies on it, do presentations on it, browse the internet and check my mail.  So nothing terribly intricate, but I feel like my internet connection is way more reliable than it was on my old computer.  
I can't see any reason to go back to a PC and probably never will.  I have an iPhone and syncing up everything is also really easy now.  OH! And I can't forget iPhoto and Garage Band!!  What GREAT applications.  I like how the iPhoto software recognizes everyone's faces.  
I recently bought an electronic drum kit to practice in my apartment.  I plan on hooking it up to garage band and seeing what options this application has for that.  I'll update this post later.

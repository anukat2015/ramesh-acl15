Title: just what I needed for office
Content:
Got this for work -- my office is sometmes freezing and I have no control over the temperature through the central heat. The noise of the fan can be noticed but it heats up the space quickly and then I can turn the fan off. This seemed safer to me than some other models where the heating element seemed more exposed. I have had no problems with it overloading the circuits.

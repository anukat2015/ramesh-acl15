Title: Discontinued coffee maker
Content:
This coffee maker is a good coffee make but Kitchenaid no longer makes this coffee maker. They havent for 3 years. I call Kitchenaid about the set buttons and they asked the ser.# and they said they stopped making the thermo-craft coffee maker a long time ago. I guess some stores have old stock. Any way kitchenaid sent a new coffee maker no charge but not the thermo-craft. That was the reason I bought it.

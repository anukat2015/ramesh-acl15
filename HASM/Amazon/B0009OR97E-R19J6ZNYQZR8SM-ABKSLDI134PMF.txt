Title: Not what I expected it to be
Content:
Loved it the first 4 times I used it (hence the single star).  I was all downhill from there. The power head died.  Company authorized a local shop to replace it, and they did so.  Shop thought it was a bearing, but it was actually a defect in the housing as well.  Process took 2 weeks and cost me $50.  New powerhead died after exactly 6 minutes of use.  I'm going to junk it as I can't afford to maintain it.  Required postage to use the company's warrenty is $40 each time, and is only good for a year.  Guess I got a lemon.

Title: Simply Fabulous
Content:
The ipod touch is the coolest mp3 player that you can buy. It truly is simply stunning. Here are some of my favorite features. 1) Gorgeous viewing screen! I mean the picture is absolutely stunning.Its almost like watching hi-def. Notice how I say almost. 2) The best gaming system around. The built in accelerometer is sooo cool. It makes the games awesome. The graphics on the game are great as well. 3) The Built in speaker. This little thing is great for casual music listening. If your gonna listen too it in a restaurant stick the earphones in. But if your just chilling at home lose the earphones and listen to it through the speaker. Over all it is probably one of the best purchases I've ever made! Get this thing!

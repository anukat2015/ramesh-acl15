Title: Still looking for a good vacuum.....
Content:
I just returned the Shark upright (turquoise model) because after 2 uses it wouldn't power on.  I contacted the manufacturer who said to ship it back to them (insured) and include a check for $14.95 for it's return to me in 6 weeks.  There was no way I was going to pay another $25-$30 for a vacuum that worked twice.  I returned it to Target.  They no longer carry that model so I decided to try the Shark Roadster.  It has suction, but the carpet attachment travels over the carpet unlike any other vac I've ever used.  Watching my husband try it out I saw small debris fly away from the vacuum head rather than going into the vacuum.  We tried it on a 5 sq. ft. area and are returning it to the store.  Bad choice.

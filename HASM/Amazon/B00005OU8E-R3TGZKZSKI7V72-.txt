Title: Heats great, but found small problem
Content:
I've taken this heater camping about 4 times and it works great. I try not to use it all night, so I turn it on while we are getting ready to go to sleep and keep it on for an hour. 
  
 I then turn it off and turn it back on in the morning for about 30 minutes before getting up. The push-button starter is very useful and allows me to turn it on fairly quick without having to look for a match or lighter. 
  
 This unit stands on the floor and blows the heat at an angle. This is great since it can heat the tent across the sleeping bads. Other units heat up and you don't get the heat across the tent and it goes straight up to the ceiling of the tent. 
  
 However, the threads on the unit where the propane bottle attaches are wearing off. I'm having problems attaching the propane cans as they fit in an angle and are hard to align.

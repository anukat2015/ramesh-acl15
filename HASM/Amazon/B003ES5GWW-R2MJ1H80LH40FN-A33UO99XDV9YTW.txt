Title: Buy one.
Content:
I have been a zune user sense the day they came out, and i must say this is the best one yet. The sound output that the ZuneHD does is the best that i have ever heard from a PMP, the Zune pass that is 15$ a month is one of the greatest things about the zune and a must if your going to invest in one to get the most out of your Zune.
The software is top of the line and i could not live without it, every thing about the ZuneHD is great but like any device it has things that need work.
Microsoft is working on getting the APP store going but it should have been "done" when the ZuneHD shipped, and with the new version of the software (Ver4.0) they added a selection of movies. I have to say i do not like the movie update they are overpriced and a large part of them are rent only at about 5$ a peice and you have to buy them with microsoft points so you end up having to spend more, i would love to see some netflix action in the zune software it would not be hard... as we all know the xbox has it so come on zune....
Over all i love this device i also own the AV Dock and it is worth buying and the HD output GREAT the OLED screen on the zune takes PMP to a new level.
In time the app store will grow and the movies will be fixed, Zune should not be passed by.

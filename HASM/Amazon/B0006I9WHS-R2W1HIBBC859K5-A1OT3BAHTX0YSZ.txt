Title: Not to bad for the price
Content:
I haven't had the product for long so I can't say on the longevity of this product but so far seems like a pretty good heater.  I'm not sure that this heater will heat a whole room (like some of the 1500w heaters I've had will) but for the price it seems to be a good supplemental heat source.  It also works great as a personal heater.  It is drafty under my desk so I put this heater on a short stool under my desk and it is wonderful.  I tryed that with another heater I had and couldn't even feel the heat but with this one the heat seems to go in all directions so it worked great.  All together this so far seems to be a pretty good deal for the very low price.

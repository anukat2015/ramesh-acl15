Title: Great coffee, brewed fast!!
Content:
This coffeemaker did everything it was advertised to do. It brews delicious coffee with ease in the blink of an eye. Seriously the fastest brewing machine I have ever seen. The design, in typical Braun fashion is well thought out in that it has only four buttons-On/Off, Auto, and hours and minutes. By holding down the On/Off you can program when your machine should automatically shut off (I set mine at 1 hour and 12 minutes). By holding down the Auto button you can set the time for when you want your brew to begin. Other machines have had a separate button for each of these functions, and not only is it intuitive but it just makes sense! In a word it is excellent.

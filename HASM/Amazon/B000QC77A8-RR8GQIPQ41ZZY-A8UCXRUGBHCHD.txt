Title: Love love love this heater
Content:
This Lasko 758000 Cyclonic Ceramic Heater, although larger than some, can be placed near a wall.  It is quiet, quick and heats a room quickly.  I bought this heater for my 86 year old Mom's room to prevent her sudden chills and the need to heat all of the house.  It has an auto function that holds the room temp constant.  The timer goes up to 7 hours, longer would be better, but I suppose it should be checked at least that often.  Very good value for the $.

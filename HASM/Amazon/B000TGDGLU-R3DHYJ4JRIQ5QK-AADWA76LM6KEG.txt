Title: Great Oil Radiator
Content:
I've had this radiator for 2 months now and I love it. I purchased it for my 7 months old baby's room, since I don't like running the central air at night. This Delonghi radiator is compact and efficient enough to keep my baby's 11'x13' room at the ideal temperature in the cold nights of Chicago. It has the ComforTemp technology, which helps keep the room at an ideal set temperature. If you keep the ComforTemp button pressed, a little green light turns on you can choose between min. med. high. buttons to set the desired temperature. This way it saves energy. My ComEd bill hasn't really gone up, since I got it. If you want to be in control, than you can switch off the ComforTemp button and set the thermostat up to 6. It doesn't dry the air either, in fact, I am not even using a humidifier. I only put some water in a bowl on it by night, just in case. It does get hot to the touch, well, it is a heater. I highly recommend this heater, for who needs it.

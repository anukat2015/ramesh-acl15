Title: Perfection in a Cup !
Content:
I have to say, I have no regrets about purchasing this coffee maker ! I was a little hesitant to shell out the cash but given coffees importance in my life, I decided to go ahead. This is a really well made machine that makes a great cup of coffee!Before I had this machine, I was always a little nervous  but hoping for the best when I had company over.Coffee is consistently delicious!The programmable feature is something we are really enjoying too,it's nice to wake up to the smell and taste of delicious coffee on these cold New York mornings!

Title: A lightweight for heavy cleaning
Content:
The Panasonic MC3920 vacuum cleaner was purchased because of its size and weight--to meet a handicap situation.  It's weight of around 10 pounds makes it easy to carry from place to place--including stairs.  It cleans very well and without having to change attachments because the one floor attachment is used on both bare and carpeted floors.  This vacuum is well worth its low price.

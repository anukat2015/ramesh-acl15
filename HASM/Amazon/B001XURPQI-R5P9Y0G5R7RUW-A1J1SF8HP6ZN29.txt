Title: Great DSLR for the duckets
Content:
I'm happy with the quality of the cam. I put a 17-40mm f4 L  Lens on it and I'm liking it even more.
I will post pics soon.
Can't go wrong with canon. I've been using their digital products for over 10 years.
I definitely recommend buying a higher quality lens over the kit.

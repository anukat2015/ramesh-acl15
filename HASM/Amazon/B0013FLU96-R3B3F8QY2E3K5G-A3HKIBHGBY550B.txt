Title: First time Mac owner
Content:
I've had my MBP for about a month now and it has been nothing but good times.  The Mac interface is much smoother and more intuitive and the software package is quite useful.  I've connected my Canon 40D to it directly and it breezes through downloads and edits.  Quite a change from the PC I was using.  I also plan on using the new Flip Mino HD with it as well.  I'm positive that the video editing results will be just as satisfying as the photo editing.  The system is screaming fast and I'm even going to upgrade my wireless network to Draft N to fully utilize the system.

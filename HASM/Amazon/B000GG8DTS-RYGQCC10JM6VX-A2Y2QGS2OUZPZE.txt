Title: Perfect for my needs
Content:
First off I live in Miami, if you're planning on using this thing to heat your apartment it's probably not right for you. I like to sit on my balcony and sometimes at night it gets a bit chilly in the winter (I'm talking about upper 50's or lower 60's not really cold weather). I've been using a 1500 watt fan heater to keep me warm while I sit out and read, this heats (me) just as much as the fan heater, saves a lot of electricity, and is quiet and doesn't blow air at me. I wouldn't use this to heat your bedroom, but if you want to use it for a purpose similar to mine, namely where you just want to heat you and not the whole outdoors, I think this is superior to a ceramic/fan heater.

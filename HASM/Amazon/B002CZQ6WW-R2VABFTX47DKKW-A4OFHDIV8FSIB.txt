Title: HP the Worst Laptop
Content:
I bought this Laptop 6-7 months ago and from last couple of weeks my laptops screen has started to flicker and now its almost impossible to work on it. My IBM thinkpad is almost 4 years old and had never given me any troubles.
Its the last time i will buy any HP Products and i sincerely would like other people to stay away from HP Laptops....

Title: Great pictures and won't break the bank - or the back
Content:
I decided to take the plunge and try a DSLR and I love this camera. I took it on a photo trip this fall where a bunch of guys had bigger more "pro" style gear - I could hardly lift some of their cameras. For me, this is perfect. The grip fits my girly hands well, and it's comfortable to carry all day. The only downside to the light weight is that when I put my biggish zoom lens on it, it feels unbalanced, especially on a tripod.  I've taken just over 2000 pictures with it, and I've not yet had any problems.  I splurged on the Canon Zoom Telephoto EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 image stabilized lens and it's super for nature photography. The image stabilizer lets me hand-hold it with acceptable-to-me results down to about 1/30 sec - better with a tripod of course but that's not always an option. 
If you're considering jumping to SLR for the first time, it's well worth looking into a class or a beginner's book or video. You'll need to wrap your mind around the aperture/exposure/depth of field relationships to really get the most out of the camera and make good lens purchase decisions for the type of photography you want to do.  I had used film SLRs ages ago, but I took a one-day class at a local camera shop right after buying the camera and it was really helpful.

Title: Great customer service!
Content:
I purchased a new BXB Bunn coffeemaker approximately 4 weeks ago.  I purchased a Bunn because of the quality and great coffee flavor.  I noticed immediately the coffee tasted weak, no matter how many grounds I added.  I thought maybe it was just me but after having a few people over they too remarked at how weak the coffee was.  I just made a phone call to Bunn customer service and they were wonderful.  I was asked to remove the basket and check for a sprayhead.  Sprayhead, what sprayhead?  All I had was a threaded screw with a nut, no sprayhaed.  Needless to say my coffeemaker was missing this most important part.  That would be the reason my coffee was weak.  The water was merely dripping through the coffee grounds and spilling into the pot instead of spraying the grounds.  I'm going to be sent two sprayheads for free!  I have read other customer reviews and there are numerous people who are complaining of weak coffee as well.  I would have to say that they too are probably missing the sprayhead.  Not sure how these coffee makers can leave the factory without them but I guess it does happen.  A simple call to Bunn customer service and they'll set you up with the missing part.  I'm looking forward to a good cup of coffee once the sprayhead arrives.  Again, great customer service which keeps me buying Bunn products!

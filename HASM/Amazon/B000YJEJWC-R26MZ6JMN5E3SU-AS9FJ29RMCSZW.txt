Title: Awful!
Content:
I bought an HDX 16 from HP with a similar set of features and accessories. I have had one problem after another, with some components never working at all. 
The touch pad was scratched new from the factory.
The hard drive was not connected.
DEAD PIXELS.
The TV tuner has never worked.
The power supply has failed.
Prone to crashing.
HP has TERRIBLE customer service.
All of this was within the first few months of getting the laptop BRAND NEW FROM THE FACTORY, and I am not rough with it at all. This computer proves there is no quality control at HP. Buy a different brand.

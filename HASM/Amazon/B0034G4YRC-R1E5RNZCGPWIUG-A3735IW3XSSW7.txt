this laptop feels comfortable, even with its size. the sound is great.I would advise anyone to remove Norton from it and use McAfee or any other antivirus, because Norton slowed it down so much. Feel free to  remove other bulkware. The recovery function from gateway is great to remove errors and return to factory settings.
Overall, the negatives about this computer pale in comparison to its positives. The main configuration aloows this machine to be relevant for at least 2-3 yrs without a major upgrade. The only processor stronger is the i7 which is not needed for routine computing. the turbo boost feature on the i5 compensates for that.I bought this because of its value for money after painstaking research. i seriously considered the HP dv7 series and the Toshiba L500 as well as sony vaio; put put together the screen size,components and extras and this comes out on top.

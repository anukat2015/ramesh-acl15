Title: Well worth the money!!
Content:
Fast, reliable, beautiful, it's all that and more. I use it every day for writing as well as graphics. It does the job flawlessly!! Highly recommend this product. I debated and debated going with a more 'well-known' and costlier HP model, similar in specs, but ultimately decided to save the $150 and get the Acer. Sooooo glad I did, as a friend ended up purchasing the HP because of brand name. They've had to call technical support several times. I love this machine.

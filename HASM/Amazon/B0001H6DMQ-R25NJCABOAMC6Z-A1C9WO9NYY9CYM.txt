Title: Could have been better
Content:
We bought the Hoover S3755 from Amazon about six months ago. The vaccum has good suction which you can control via a sliding-switch. But it is very noisy and the wand and canister are quite heavy. Together with the large hose the unit is very bulky. The bagless dirt container is small and fills up quickly. It is also difficult to clean (poor design). The filter clogs often and again is difficult and very messy to clean. The Hepa filter (the second filter on this unit) is very thin and useless in my opinion. While it works ok on hard-wood floors, on carpets it is very difficult to manuver. Overall we got it cheap on Amazon and it is ok for what we paid for it.

Title: Less than pleased
Content:
I ordered the portable Far Infrared Heater Model DR-968 on 2-22-10.  I received the heater in a timely manner.  I began using the heater the day it was received.  The heater only worked two (2) days.  My attempts to get a replacement were not answered until I sent an e-mail through Amazon.com.  I then received an e-mail from the company stating a replacement was being shipped out that very day.  Waited a week and still no replacement heater.  Sent another e-mail only to be told my replacement heater had not been sent.  There had been a mix-up and the paper work had gotten misplaced. However, my replacement heater would be sent out that day or latest the next.  I just received my replacement heater (3-31-10). I check it and for now it is working.  Hope this heater will not stop after a couple of days. It is my opinion, had it not been for one of my e-mails going thur Amazon.com I would still be waiting on a replacement heater. I do not have a lot of trust in this company.  Grady W. Conner

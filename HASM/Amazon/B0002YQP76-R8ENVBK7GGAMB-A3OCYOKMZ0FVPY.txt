Title: OK regulator, wouldn't buy it from Amazon
Content:
This is an OK regulator, with drawbacks..... it doesn't come with a hose, which I knew, but should have given more thought to.  Also, the tank attachment is not the new standard, so that had to be replaced.  Again my falt, I should have been more diligent.  But the biggest complaint I have, which I also should have caught, is that the shipping price from Ace was more than the regultor itself, making a less than $20 regulator almost $40.  I expect more from Amazon.

Title: Great, convenient coffee maker for one!
Content:
I've had my Two-to-Go coffee maker for five years now. I tend to brew one or two batches of coffee per day, and I have had no trouble with the on/off switch as some reviewers did. I also don't have problems with overflowing/uneven filling of coffee mugs, although I did have that happen when the machine was on an uneven surface.  
I didn't know that Cuisinart recommended not putting the mugs in the dishwasher, so I used to do that all the time. Water gets inside (in the insulating layer) and leaks out if you do, but that was a minor inconvenience.
The tops stay on securely and don't leak unless the rubber o-ring is out of place. They can be a little difficult to put on though. Of course, I don't mind having to force them on because it makes me believe that the top is secure.
The simplicity of the machine also makes it really easy to clean.
Overall, I have been very pleased with the quality of the coffee brewed, and the machine pays for itself in a month of not going to a coffee shop. I definitely recommend owning this if you live by yourself. A whole pot of coffee is usually too much for one.

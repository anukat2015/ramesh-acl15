Title: Good, but not as good as the mini 10
Content:
I pre-ordered this for the Nov. 5, 2008 release date, and anxiously awaited its arrival.  I wanted it for its compactness and portability, and I am certainly not disappointed on either of those considerations.  This netbook is awesome for taking on an airplane or to the coffee shop.  The battery lasts about 4 hours, which is more than enough for my typical usage.  The keyboard is at 85% size, which I am able to adjust to without too much trouble.  I like that the mouse buttons are in the normal locations.  The biggest complaint about the keyboard is the apostrophe key being out of place.  Even after almost a year of constant usage, I still have to hunt for that key, and I am a better-than-average typist.  Every now and then it runs slowly because of memory size.  Those are my two complaints, BOTH of which I believe are resolved in the new Dell Mini 10.  A 92% keyboard with all the keys in the right place, and a 120 or 160 gig harddrive.  I wish I had waited, but at the same time I am very happy with this and use it almost exclusively.  I use it for word processing, email and internet, powerpoint presentations, photo editing, etc.  I am overall very happy with it, but think I would be happier still with the mini 10.

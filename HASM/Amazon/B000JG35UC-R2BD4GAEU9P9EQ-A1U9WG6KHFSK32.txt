Title: Nice and Comfy!
Content:
I first saw some of these loaded on a cart in a Federal Government building. I thought it was a good alternative to a conventional heater which uses much more electricity and runs a lot hotter. I ordered two, I use one near my computer area in the basement and the other I put under the kitchen table. Both areas are very comfortable now. I generally keep the units on 24/7, as they only use about 170 watts. I think they're pretty neat!

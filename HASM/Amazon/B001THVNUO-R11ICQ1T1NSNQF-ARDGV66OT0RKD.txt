Title: I love it and ordered another one
Content:
This is a great, economical portable AC unit that has been a blessing in the Texas heat wave and drought of 2009.  We are so dry that all I did was plug it in.  No extra water, no venting, it just sits there in the middle of the room and cools.  I don't know what all the griping is about except that folk must not have priced these units elsewhere.  It was easy to set up and the instructions were clear and in a booklet.  The unit saved my life one night when my Central AC went out.  It weighs 55 pounds and is on wheels.  Best bargain I have found!  Home Depot's cheapest offer was an evaporative cooler.  Ugh!  If we ever have winter, I can put it in a corner until spring.

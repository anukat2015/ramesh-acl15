Title: It's Rusting!  It leaks steam, I regret the purchase
Content:
I purchased this exact model about 6 months ago.  On the top of the unit where you pour the water in there are two screws.  Not only are the screws RUSTING, but they are placed in an area that one can expect to have some water run....  ESPECIALLY if the top "leaks" steam as other reviewers have commented.  First 3 runs on this machine were great and I was excited to have a home expresso maker.  So excited I threw the receipt and box away.  A short 3 months later and my disappointment has grown.  
So, not only does it have rusting screws and a leaking top - which causes you to lose expresso (the steam has to be forced through the filter) the pressure just isn't there, but it's unsafe.  Very unsafe.  This device does not have an autoshutoff feature.  The inside of the unit that boils the water gets VERY hot.  I would hate to think a fire could start because of this but in my opinion, it may certainly be possible.  
Would I recommend this unit.  Never.  And, I would hesitate purchasing any DeLonghi product.  Do your research.  But this is one purchase that I regret.

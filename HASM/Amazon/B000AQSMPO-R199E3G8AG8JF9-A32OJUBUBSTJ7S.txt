Title: Mixed feelings
Content:
Got this for Christmas and the gadget guy in me thinks it's cool. There's no doubt that it's simple and easy to use, though I'm not sure the point of a pre-set timer since it can heat up the water in &lt;2 minutes and it's cooling in your mug the second it hits.
I also question the cost of both the unit and the coffee. Forty-two cents isn't bad for a cup of great coffee, but I'm still experimenting and haven't hit that "great cup" just yet. Having gone through the sampler pack and a box of Newman's Extra Bold (that the wife got me), I'm still experimenting. Issues around the plastic waste generated by each of those k-cups.
Note as well, tea from these units is weak due to it's fast brew system. Hot chocolate was similar, but may differ by maker.

This unit has been great for weekend cups of coffee. I still have not found that amazing cup of coffee, but continue trying new brands. So far Newmans Extra bold, Timothy's Melange Italien, and Gloria Jean's Special Blend...all middle of the road for me. Looking forward to trying something flavored.

Title: Soleus Air Heaters and Humidifiers
Content:
I bought four units, one large and three small for the living room and the bedrooms.  The humidifiers filled up water trays within an hour that were difficult to empty and the rooms heated painfully slow.  Two of the units leaked and ruined my hardwood floors.  After 30 days ALL FOUR of the units completely stopped working and the return policy was void.  I HATE this company for taking almost $1500 of my money for faulty products.

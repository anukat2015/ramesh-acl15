Title: Honey of a Heater
Content:
I wasn't exactly certain how well this heater would work as I have had others (not Honeywell) which seemed to make the room rediculously hot in a very short time and some which barely did so.  I was quite impressed that the heater works very well and provides the right amount of heat within a 3 - 5 minute period.  I will add that I am using this in my bathroom and it clearly says in the instructions NOT to use it in a bathroom.  But I have it in an area which is well-ventilated and away from anything which could catch fire.  It is great to come out of my shower and not have the feeling that I am freezing.  I am very happy with the product and have had a few other Honeywell products (Air-Cleaners, Programmable Thermostats) and they all worked really well.

Title: Beware Pinguinos LEAK !! Do not purchase this product!!
Content:
We are on our second Pinguino after our first machine leaked on our carpet. We returned the unit now the second machine leaks aproximately 4 pints of water a day. Delonghi know they are selling a defective product. When you call customer service there is a promt for Penguinuo air conditioners!
They refuse to do anything about replacing this unit at no cost to me.

Title: Great coffemaker so far
Content:
I got the B40 about a week ago and so far could not be more pleased.  I considered the B50 initially, but then determined that the programming and dual brew size were not necessary for me.  After all, if the brew cycle only takes about 30 seconds, why set a timer for it to start at a certain time?  Doing without those two features saved $50 also.  The unit came with a sample pack of 18 different coffees and a couple of teas.  The flavors/blends that I have tried so far have all been good.  I don't usually like very strong/bold coffee, so I can't pass adequate judgement on those varieties.  You can buy the K-Cups from several online sources in a variety of flavors for about $9-$13 for a 25-pack.
The brewer itself couldn't be easier to use.  I am the only coffee drinker in the house, so I specifically wanted a single cup brewer.  My online research led my to this unit and I am very pleased.  The initial start-up out of the box takes about 3 minutes to get the system primed and heated.  After that, the manual recommends leaving the unit on, which I do.  If you choose to have it shut off after use it will take a couple of minutes to heat the water before the next brew.  In my case I simply pop a K-Cup into the brewer, push the brew button and 30 seconds later I have a hot cup of tea or coffee.  Remove the K-Cup and you're done.  The only cleanup is a 2-3 time yearly de-scale process.  The unit is a little noisy in the brew process, but it's not loud at all.  That's the only negative I would give it and I hesitate to call it a negative.

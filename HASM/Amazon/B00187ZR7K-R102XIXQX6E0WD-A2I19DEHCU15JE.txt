Title: love this heater
Content:
I love this heater.  I gave one to my mother for Xmas. She uses it in her main living area (about 900 sq ft with vaulted ceiling) and then wheels it into her bedroom at night.
She has her furnace set on low so it hardy ever kicks on.  Provides very warming even heat, and feels much cozier
than the heat from the furnace.  Also costs way less to operate.
Uses 1.5 kw per hour when it's running.  It's on a thermostat, so cycles on and off throughout the day.
On average it's on about 16 hours out of the 24. So 1.5 kwh x 16 hours = 24 kw hours in a 24 hour period.
24 x .1 = $2.40 per day (her power co. charges 10 cents per kwh).  That's $72 per month for heat.  Not bad at all for this quality and amount
of heat! Needless to say the gift was a huge hit!!

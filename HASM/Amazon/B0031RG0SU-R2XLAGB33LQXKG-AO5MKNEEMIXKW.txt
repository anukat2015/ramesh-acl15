I bought this primarily for Blu-Ray player, to occasionally hook up to HD TV in family room / bedroom, and not needing to invest in multiple BD players. Generally good machine but found out couple of annoying things with the blu-ray player. This comes with Power DVD8.. specifically when playing blu-ray DVDs (1) The output can go to EITHER built-in screen or the TV but not both simultaneously and (2) the mouse does not work to control/select (menu items etc), it has to be keyboard with arrows/enter keys, like in DOS days! 
So I contacted gateway (thru the customer service "chat"), who, after "registration" info and rest of my life history tell me that they do not support "third party" things (like this Power DVD) and only hardware + OS. But here is the kicker, they will be happy if I called "answers by gateway" where the charge meter will start one minute into call.
So machine is ok (even good, but there are many out there) just the customer service and the main thing I wanted (blu-ray player) to work reasonably well, sucks. I should have done more research and stuck to more 'standard' brands, in hindsight, learning you get what you pay for.

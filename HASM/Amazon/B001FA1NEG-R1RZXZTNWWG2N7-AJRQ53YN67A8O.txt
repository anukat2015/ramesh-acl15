Title: IPOD NANO
Content:
It is my 1st MP3 type of player. It has the advantage of all the MP3 players. Able to store lots of music instead carrying a CD player and all the CDs. Despite its reputation of user friendly. It did take me a while to learn to use it. It is worth it! Able to listen to lots of music through a compact device is a treat.

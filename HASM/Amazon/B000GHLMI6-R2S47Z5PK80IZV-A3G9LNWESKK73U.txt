Title: Great coffee pot
Content:
I love this coffee pot. It brews hot, great tasting coffee. I also love that their is no carafe to deal with. It has a nice, modern look that goes well with the other appliances in my kitchen. The only downside is it does take some practice to learn how to pour the water in without spilling it on the counter but it's really not that difficult. I also had the old version (without the stainless steel plate on the front) and it lasted about 4.5 years and made great coffee the whole time.

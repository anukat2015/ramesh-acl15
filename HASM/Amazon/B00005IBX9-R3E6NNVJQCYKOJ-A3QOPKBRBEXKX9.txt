Title: Brews okay, but not for the coffee connossieur
Content:
1) If you love coffee, don't buy a glass caraffe that will burn the bottom after the coffee sits for about 15 minutes; opt instead for a thermal insulated caraffe option.
2) If you like to make a full pot, this coffee maker only holds enough coffee to brew 1Tbsp per cup.  If you liked stronger coffee or brew with the method recommended by many gourmet brands, you will not be able to fit enough coffee in the machine to make a full pot to your desired strength.
Cuisinart is a great brand, and I love most of their appliances; 
I even like the Burr Grinder that I own.  They haven't taken on the coffee space as experts with this machine.

Title: Great for what it is.
Content:
Its a perfect Ipod for short use. Its great for going to the gym, running, working around the house, or for making "driving" playlists for your drive to work. Its portability is great, size is perfect and holds more then enough music to get you through your workouts. If you want something to use all day I would suggest a different Ipod, I am not knocking the shuffle at all tho.

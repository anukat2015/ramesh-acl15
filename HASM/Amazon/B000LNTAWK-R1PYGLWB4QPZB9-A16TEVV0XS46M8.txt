Title: The best just keeps getting better
Content:
I bought this camera a year ago after a long line of Nikon ownership.  First the F series (still have my F-3), then the 5400 point and shoot, The D-100, The D-70 and finally the D-200.Nikon's digital progression has been excellent and I must say that all of the Nikon digital camera bodies I have owned have held a reasonable value when upgrading to the next in the line.
This body is everything that you would expect in a "pro-sumer" camera from them that incorporates features and benefits from their higher end pro models.  If you like Nikon, you'll LOVE this camera.
I have also converted most of my lenses to the D series and have been quite pleased.  My only complaint about the D series lenses is that most are F 3.5-5.6 so they are not particularly "fast" lenses.  They make up for it in their superb, distortion and chromatic abberation free quality.  The bonus here --as you likely already know is that all of your old, manual lenses still fit and are fun to experiment with at their new effective focal lengths approximately 1.45x their original.  (okay, I know I should dump my old F 2.0 20mm but I just can't even though I have the 12-24).
I highly recommend this body!

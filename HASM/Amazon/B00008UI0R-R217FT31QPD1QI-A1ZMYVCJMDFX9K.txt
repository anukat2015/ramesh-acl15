Title: This vacuum sucks!  :-)
Content:
I'm very much a canister-type vacuum person, having used both that and uprights before.  I've had this model for a month now.  It works extremely well in my 4-pet house.  The hard floor/rug attachment is easy on/easy off and the extending handle helps greatly for cleaning reach, my height, and not having to bend over to clean my floors.  The dirt canister is a bit small but with 4 pets and a large house, nearly anything would be.  I love the touch controls at my fingertips -- again, helps with the bending.  It also runs fairly quiet for a vacuum.
I haven't used many of the accessories; the stair attachment seems to work just fine.  It's bit awkward trying to manage both vacuum and angle the brush to the right degree, and I hope more practice will let me figure out the optimum way to use it.

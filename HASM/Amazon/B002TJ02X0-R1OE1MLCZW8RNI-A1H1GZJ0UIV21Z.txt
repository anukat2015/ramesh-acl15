Title: Much better than Kenmore
Content:
This vacuum is so much better than the Kenmore it replaced. Kenmore is always highly rated in Consumer Reports Magazine (this one was also highly rated), but I found the construction of our last Kenmore upright vacuum to be very poor. The connection between the hose and the wand for using the hardwood floor brush depended on two little plastic nubs on the hose. These broke off after a few months. The wand was forever getting loose. :(
In contrast the Electrolux Oxygen canister model has a mechanical positive click mechanism for the wand. The accessories (including the hardwood floor brush) is by friction, but it sticks on very securely and I expect it will keep working well in the future.
We picked this instead of the 2 times as expensive Miele. We've had it a couple of months; so far it is working great.

Title: Loud and unreliable
Content:
I've owned my Vornado for about a year and a half. I've already had to return it once because the on/off switch stopped functioning (not damaged, just stopped working). Paid Vornado $45 for the repair.
Recently, the fan has started getting much louder to where I really can't run it at night and still sleep. I'm either looking at another $45 repair or tossing it and buying a new heater. If I do replace, it likely won't be with another Vornado.

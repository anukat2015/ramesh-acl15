Title: Excellent bang for the buck!
Content:
After living with a Celeron-crippled Toshiba 14-incher for 3 years and then, being swept away by the performance and ease of use of a 13" white MacBook, the slim profile of the Asus UL20A-A1 plus the promise of Windows 7 (which has served me well on my machines at work) lured me to this laptop! And, was it a great buy or what?! The Amazon $75 gift card bundle was the clincher! I straightaway moved up from Win 7 Home Premium that came with the Asus to Win 7 Professional (using the Anytime Upgrade key that I purchased on Amazon along with the Asus) - did this in order to be able to use the Windows XP Mode free add-on for the sake of running certain 32-bit apps (a particular corporate VPN Client to be exact) that just don't work natively on Win 7 64-bit flavors. Coming back to the Asus, it's extremely portable at just 3.3 lbs, has solid battery life (been getting ~6 hours in Win 7's own "Balanced" mode), zippy performance (mostly used it for work via the XP Mode and Remote Desktop and for browsing with Google Chrome), quick bootup time into Windows and a good keyboard (although it takes a couple of days to get used to - particularly the narrow Shift key and the vertically stacked Home/PgUp/PgDn/End keys on the right). All in all, it's the best Wintel laptop package that I've seen in a long time! Having never used an Asus before, was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this unit!

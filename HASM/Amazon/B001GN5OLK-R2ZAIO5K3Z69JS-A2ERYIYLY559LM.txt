Title: Finally backlit keyboard
Content:
This is pretty much configuartion that I got and performance is pretty good with this laptop.
Lighted keyaboard had an impact on decission when I decided to buy this laptop and it is really nice and usefull feature that I was looking some time for it.
Pros:
- Very stable, no reboots and doesn't get frozen even when moving/shaking it
- Good metal construction --> no flexing
- Good set of connection slots for perrifferrals
- Backlit keyboard
- Very bright screen but not the best color rendering
- e-SATA external connector
- Internal Intel wireless 5300 AGN WiFi card is excellent
Cons:
- LCD display is somewhat washed out although very bright
- It gets very hot even just browsing internet after relatively brief period. Poor ventilation.
- Somewhat heavy for its size
- Average battery life (little bit over 3hr of usage when just browsing internet via WiFi with standard battery)
- Proprietary HDMI connector (need to buy separate pigtail adapter)
I have it almost for a year now and no crashes or some issues or glitches so far. 
Overall very good business laptop.

Title: I'm not sure....is all this steam normal?
Content:
We bought this to replace another Mr. Coffee that gave up the ghost.  There's not much choice in the remote area where we live, otherwise I would have tried something different from a Mr. Coffee.  The very first time we used this, during the cleaning cycle recommended before brewing your first cup of coffee, the machine made alot of noise, as if the maker required cleaning already.  It also procuces alot of "steam" out of the top while brewing.  Perhaps this is normal, I don't know.  But the coffee tastes good, it's easy to see how much water is in the reservoir, and the basket seems to slip easily into place, which will make a nice change from our previous Mr. Coffee.  Just hope that this one lasts more than three years.  At $49.99 I would expect it to last longer.

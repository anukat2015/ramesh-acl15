Title: Brand new vac did not work!
Content:
Received this highly rated vacuum and the darned power head didn't work at all.  The unit seems high quality, but something was not right.  After finding a number to call (NOT toll-free, I might add), the person suggested I could take item into repair center - and if belt was bad I would be charged for visit - or send item back to Amazon - which is what I did after verifying that belt was indeed good.  I felt like the switches on handle didn't work.
So now I'm using my duct-taped old dirt-devil, and fretting over what to do - if this highly rated vacuum is a piece of dooky, what are my other options?  And really, couldn't Hoover spring for a toll-free line?  I feel that Hoover should have said: Oh, how terrible, let us ship you a replacement today!  Grrr!

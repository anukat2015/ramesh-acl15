Title: Gives infrequent, insufficient bursts of warm air
Content:
I got this at Rite Aid to keep me warm at night. I specifically chose this fan heater because of its thermostat feature so that my room wouldn't get too hot overnight.
I tried setting the thermostat to 70 degrees, but when that didn't satisfy me, I set it to 80 on high. This thing behaves ridiculously. It'll turn on for a minute or so, but then it'll off for about a half hour before starting up again. Even with it set at 80 degrees, the room can't have been more than 72 degrees when I awoke in the morning. I don't think it ever gets up to 80 degrees before shutting off again. I'll be returning this to the store.
The 1 Touch control sounds simple and convenient, but it's actually a bit of a hinderance to have to cycle through a dozen options. A plus is that the fan really is considerably quiet (though, on low, it has an eerie buzz to it).

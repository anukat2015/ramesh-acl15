Title: Great tasting coffe and virtually no clean up
Content:
After my husband tried coffee from a Keurig at a neighbor's house, he came home to tell me we must buy one.  I was skeptical at first.  The cost of the K cups was a huge factor in my hesitation.  However, I gave in because I hated throwing pot after pot of coffee down the drain because it is impossible to brew just one cup of coffee in the traditional coffee maker.    It's been 2 years since we bought our Keurig and I don't know how I've ever managed without it.  There is virtually NO clean up!  The coffee is excellent, especially once you find the flavors you like.  I suggest purchasing a multiple flavor pack so you're not stuck with a bunch of coffee you don't like.  The K cups are hard to find in stores.  I have found the cheapest place to buy them is here on amazon using their Subscribe and Save program.  It runs about $20 for 50 K cups so 50 cents/cup a coffee....per perfect cup of coffee, I might add.  :)   The water tank is awkward to fill up due to its off shape.  I have found the best way to fill it up is to bring water to it instead of bringing the tank to the water source.    If you take out the used K cup, you can brew just water for tea, hot cocoa or even oatmeal.    The Keurig is a handsome machine and is my one kitchen MUST HAVE besides the microwave.  I have told all of my friends about it and am here on amazon scouring prices to purchase one for a gift.

Title: Used it 2 times and it's dead
Content:
Actually, I have nothing more to add. Turned it on, tested. It worked. Didn't use it for a month. Wanted to make me some coffee one day. Tried to turn it on, but nothing happened: no light, no sounds, nothing. Tried different plugs - nothing, it's dead. Black&Decker wants me to ship it to get a replacement one - I pay for shipping. Too much trouble for $14... Will keep the mug as some bad memories. What a junk....

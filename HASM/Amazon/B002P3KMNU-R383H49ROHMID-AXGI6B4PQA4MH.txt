Title: Fantastic machine
Content:
This is a great little machine, one of the best laptops that I've owned (and I've owned a ton). There has been a lot written about its pros and cons already so I won't rehash everything that's already been said, but here are some top of mind thoughts:
* Great build quality, very sturdy
* Performance is better than I expected for a 1.3GHz machine. As has been said, it's not a powerhouse but it's far more powerful than my netbook that has the 1.6GHz Atom CPU
* Great battery life. I haven't fully tested the total length but 10 hours of basic use seems realistic based on what I'm seeing
* The screen is *awesome*
* The AC adapter is small and light, doesn't add much bulk in my bag
* The keyboard is great. I'm 6'4" and have big hands and have no problems with the keyboard
* The trackpad is mediocre and is really the only thing that I'm even slghtly disappointed with
* It's sexy! It draws attention and people ask about it when I use it in public places
* The only things I can think of that would make it absolutely perfect are bluetooth, a gigabit NIC, and an integrated CDMA broadband card. I won't hold that against it though, because I knew it didn't have those features when I bought it so not having them doesn't impact my expectations of the machine itself
I should note that I'm using this as a secondary machine. My primary laptop is a full size and very powerful Lenovo, but I wanted a 2nd machine that's light, thin, and has a long battery life that would be easier for me to travel with. I originally had a netbook as a 2nd machine but was unhappy with its performance and the screen and keyboard were just too small for me. Then I moved to an HP tablet as a 2nd machine but it was thicker than I wanted, and the battery life didn't meet my expectations. So the Asus is my 3rd attempt at a secondary machine and I knew minutes after I opened the box that this was exactly what I had been looking for. All of that having been said, I would find it small and a tad underpowered if this was my only machine that I did all of my work on. YMMV.

Title: Super camera at a resonable price!
Content:
I recently upgraded from a Nikon D70 to the D80, and I am in love with my camera again!  I had stopped using the D70 because it seemed no matter what I did my images were always grainy looking.  With the D80 all of my images have been extremely sharp, even with an older 300mm lens.  I also love being able to hold down the shutter button and let the camera take picture after picture, I have been able to get some amazing shots as a result.  I think the built in flash is more powerful than on the D70 as well, some pictures I took inside turned out good and did not look like an obvious flash picture (shadows, dark background, etc.).  I highly recommend this camera.

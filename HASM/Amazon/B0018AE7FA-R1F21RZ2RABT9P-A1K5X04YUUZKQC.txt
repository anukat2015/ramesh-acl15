Title: Not really 6 cups
Content:
I also bought one of these expecting it to make more coffee that a 4 cup coffee maker of another brand only to discover that it makes a little less - about 3.75 cups. A cup is a standard unit of measure equaling 8 ounces. It is a nice little coffee maker but be aware that you will get 3-4 cups of coffee from it.

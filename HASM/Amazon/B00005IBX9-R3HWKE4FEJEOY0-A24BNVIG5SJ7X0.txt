Title: Pourable Perfection
Content:
This is the most satisfying coffeemaking experience in my 50 years of drinking coffee. The unit brews very quickly and produces a smooth full bodied brew. The adjustable hot plate lets you crank the heat level down a bit, which extends the half life of the finished coffee and prevents a blistered toungue when waking from sleep induced dementia.  The lids snaps on securely and this pot never drips a drops.  The spout makes pouring a breeze.  It is possible to aim exactly where you want to pour and never worry about dribbles. Hitting the fill ports for the water reservoir,is easily done with the pouring ability of the carafe. After two years of frustration witha faulty KitchenAid units, I could not be happier with this fine coffee instrument.

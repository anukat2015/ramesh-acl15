Title: Excellent alternative to the iPod Classic
Content:
I've owned a 20GB Ipod, 40GB Video Ipod, 80GB Ipod Classic, 80GB Zune, and now the 120GB Zune.  This is by far my favorite of them all.  
- Sound quality is better.  It's not "colored" or "processed" like with the ipod classics.  
- The screen is gorgeous.  The interface is extremely convenient as well as intuitive.  
- Zune 3 is great and I have yet to have any problems with tags and what not (only had to re-tag 1 song and it was my fault to begin with).  It's just a cooler and more useful layout than itunes, in my opinion.  
- Hexic and texas hold 'em help kill time but I still miss vortex and solitaire sometimes.  
- This is just a really classy looking player.  It's not even close to being as cool as an ipod touch but it crushes the ipod classics in sound quality, screen size, wi-fi, and interface.  Then again, for someone like me, it's more useful to carry my entire music collection (and some videos) in a 120GB player than a 32GB player that just looks cool.

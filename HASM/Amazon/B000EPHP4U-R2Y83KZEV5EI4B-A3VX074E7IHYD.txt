Title: iPod Nano
Content:
Well, I bought iPod Nano and I have to confess, it is absolutely perfect! The use of flash-memory was a well-thought decision, and made the Nano look like a toy MP3 player. I live in Brazil and when I showed it to my friends, they didn't believed that such a little thing could play musics and hold up to 2000 5 MP pictures. I was really lucky of not losing them.
But, I have to confess too, this thing really scratches!! I was afraid of taking it for a lot of places because of the big risk of making a horrible scratch just in front of the photo you're showing to your friends. Even a nice case cannot protect your little gadget form the dangers of nowadays. I found myself needing to put mine in a sock and have the utmost care with it. In the other hand, one friend of mine bought the white Nano and till today, there are no scratch problems.
And other thing: I don't know if this happens to all iPods or just to mine, but sometimes the Play/Pause button didn't work everytime, and to switch my Nano off, I had to be very patient. Apple should correct this.
In the end, I recommend it. But I think you'd better buy the white Nano if you don't want to live with some incovenient scratches.

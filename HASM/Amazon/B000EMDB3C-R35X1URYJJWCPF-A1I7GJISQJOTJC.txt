Title: Great coffee maker!!!!
Content:
Because my wife likes flavored cofee, and I like my coffee to taste like cofee, this was the perfect solution to our dilema. One maker, one area of counter space, two different brews. It brews quickly, the thermal mugs keep it hot, and we are able to avoid the time and money wasting stop at the local coffee shop on our way to work in the morning. The filter baskets are easy to clean, and there are no paper filters to deal with.

Title: I like it, BUT.
Content:
Very nice coffee maker. Easy to program and set up. Coffee is flavorable and the warmer plate keeps the coffee hot. However, the quality of construction and/or design is an issue. The catch that holds the filter to the top doesn't hold the filter securely and the filter basket has detached while brewing coffee. This caused the filter to swing out from it's position while the hot water is dripping into the carafe. Cheap plastic parts do not fit properly is probably the cause of this problem.

Title: Super Entry into Digital SLR
Content:
I have owned my Rebel xti for two years now, taking over 20,000 photos.  I have had one other digital camera in the past, before using my Canon AE-1 Program for over 20 years.  I could not have picked a better camera to upgrade to.  It is easy to use.  It has all the automatic buttons, for beginners, but if you are more advanced, as I was, it worked like a pro camera.  I worked at a race track and took thousands of racing photos, and the camera never let me down.  If I had a bad photo, it was because of me, not the camera.  I use Canon lenses, which I think are worth the money.  I do recommend buying extra batteries and compact flash cards, just for backup.  The replacement batteries have a better lifespan than the Canon battery, but all of them hold a charge for a long time.  I never ran out of battery when using one fully charged.  
I cannot praise this camera enough.

Title: Great Camera For Every Level
Content:
I'm not the most mechanical member of my family, so I rely on others often to assist with the technical aspects of complex cameras and computers before making purchasing choices and afterwards for assistance in learning the ropes. I came to the table after enjoying my old Cannon 35mm camera for years, buying one of the first slow but expensive digital cameras which took a disc, and then buying a cheap digital camera which immediately broke. As a result of these digital dilemmas, I decided to rely on the experts. After much research and comparison,  my adult stepson purchased a Nikon D70 and, delighted with this camera, even so, he advised me to purchase the D50. I am very pleased with this purchase. He agreed that I simply did not need the additional features (and expense) of the D70. And he was correct. This camera takes great pictures almost out of the box. With a few lessons, by reading the instructions, buying an inexpensive, easy to understand manual, and spending a little time with my stepson, I'm taking the best pictures ever, and really enjoying the ease and seamlessness of the camera's features. I'm a Mac user and the photos easily adapt to iphoto. I'm hooked. I've got lenses, a camera bag and other add on items. So, finally, it is here: a great camera at a reasonable price that is easy enough to master without too many bells and whistles. This camera is usable and not so complex that it just stays in the bag collecting dust. And the photos are professional in quality.

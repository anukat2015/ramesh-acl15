Title: Great camera with more features than you will ever need!
Content:
I bought this camera with the kit lens and the 55-200 VR lens as my first digital SLR.  It is a great product with all the features I can possibly use and in a recent photo class I got to try most of them.  I cannot believe how far cameras have come since my SRT 101!  This combination is light, and fast and it will not let you make many common mistakes such as accidentally underexposing a subject.

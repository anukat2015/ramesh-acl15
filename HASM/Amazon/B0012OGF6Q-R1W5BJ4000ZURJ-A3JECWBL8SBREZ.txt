Title: Great camera, many great features
Content:
The main thing purchasers should be aware of on this camera is that it does NOT have a digital view-finder/preview.  All photos are shot through the eye view finder.  This can be inconvenient if you need to hold the camera above your head, say, in crowds, or at ground level to capture a small animal or child.
That said, the camera is fairly light and simple to use.  Controls are intuitive and some in-camera editing can be done (cropping, and lightening up dark areas, plus some filter effects).  The photos are very good, but use the manual focus in dim situations if at all possible.  And spend plenty of time learning the features.
It's a Nikon.  It's a quality camera.  And Amazon had the best price for a reliable seller of any place I could find.  On that: beware those "gray market" sellers at all costs.  Unless you buy hundreds of dollars of over-priced extras, you'll never see the camera, and they'll have your credit card information.  You can trust Amazon, always.

Title: Spiffy Vacuum!
Content:
OK, we kill vacuums. In the past 5 years, we have gone through 3 uprights; 1 electric sweeper; a Roomba (he still works, but shivers and screams when he has to do a lot of work); and a Scooba (he went belly up pretty quick). 
When the $300 Hoover Savvy (our most recent upright) went belly up (A mishap involving the power cord on a bluetooth headset, and an unbreakable/irreplaceable belt bit the dust), I decided to get our newest vac today.
After some research and not being able to get my first choice, I chose the Bissel Pet Eraser. I did not have high hopes since we have eaten the cord with previous Bissel's and have had them lose their suck pretty quick.
We hooked on the handle with its single screw and gave it a whirl.... DANG! I am not sure if I am thrilled or excited about how much dirt and hair this puppy picked up in a couple of minutes on our berber carpet. 
After this display, I went on a floor cleaning frenzy... My two area rugs were renewed, my tile vacuumed up nicely, and I got the dust and crud out of the edges of our baseboards. So, right now I am a happy camper and do hope hat this holds up to my two dogs, 2 cats (one long haired), 3 ferrets, my sloppy husband and me.

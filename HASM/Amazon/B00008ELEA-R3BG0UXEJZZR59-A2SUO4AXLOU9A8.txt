Title: Best Coffee Ever
Content:
we had forgotten what coffee , real coffee, truly tasted like. WOW! we will never DRIP again. if you don't or never have percolated...you're in for a treat. you need to let the pot season for about a weeks worth of coffee making and then you truly can taste the real flavor. you need to have fresh beans so get a grinder (you won't regret it) and figure out what strength you like and start percolating. you will waste no more coffee cuz you will drink every drop or at least we do ;-}

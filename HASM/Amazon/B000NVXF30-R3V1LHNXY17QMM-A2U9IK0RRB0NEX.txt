Title: Olympus Evolt 510 almost perfect
Content:
I have used the camera for a variety of pictures over the past month and have found it takes very good pictures.  This is my first DSLR, and I believe it is a good value for the money.
My only complaint is that the camera autofocus sometimes has trouble indoors when the light isn't so great.  Seems the camera can't find focus quickly, even when using the flash assist when focusing.
Overall, though, I'm quite happy.  The zoom 150MM telephoto has allowed me to take some great wildlife shots

Title: GREAT vacuum
Content:
This Shark is dynamite - a great little vacuum.  I compared with Black & Decker and others, and they just didn't have the power this thing has.  We have a cat, whose litter box is in a bathroom with tile floors and rugs.  I use the Shark with its powered brush head daily, and it grabs all the spare clay litter that the cat trailed around so it doesn't spread all over the house!  The brush head works well both on the tile floor as well as on the rugs, going pretty deep on the latter, like a regular vacuum.
Be sure and do as the manual says - with the NiCad battery, you must fully charge for first use - and then allow to completely discharge for 2 or 3 passes.  Then you can use, charge, use, charge, etc., like normal.
BTW, the manufacturer offers a wall-mounted charging stand for $4 (plus $6 to get it to you), though it's not included with the vacuum.  Definitely worth having.

Title: overpriced space heater
Content:
like any other computer you could run, be it osx, windows, linux, what have you...this computer will allow you to surf the web and read email (lets face it, thats all you use it for). the difference is this beast will cook your lap. i've never had a laptop (even other apple laptops) that generated so much heat. a laptop cooler is required if you buy this computer. furthermore the combo trackpad/mouse button is an utter disaster. i don't know anyone who really likes it.

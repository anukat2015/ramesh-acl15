Title: NOT a family room heater.........
Content:
If you've got high ceilings or an area larger than 14x14 and expect this unit to heat, you're going to be disappointed. Also, as the previous review states, the heat rises from the top of the unit, which is about 2 1/2 feet off the ground.  If you're prone to "cold feet" this unit is NOT for you. 
 There is no fan on this unit, so it's perfect for an office, baby's room or bedroom that always seems to be a bit chilly. If you have a large bathroom, this would be great to pre-set the attached 24 hour timer to come on an hour or so before you get up. 
So if you want to heat a 12x12 or 12x14 room or smaller this unit will be fine. Just dont expect your legs and feet to be warm.

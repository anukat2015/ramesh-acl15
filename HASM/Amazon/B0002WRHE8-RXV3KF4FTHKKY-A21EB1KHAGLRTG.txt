Title: Great heater when simple precautions followed.
Content:
I was concerned when I purchased this unit.  There are a number of highly negative reviews on it.  However, on further research, I have discovered that the circumstances leading to those reviews could have been avoided.
When one uses this heater with a 20 lb propane bottle & accessory hose, it is imperative that you always shut the tank off first & let the heater run until it burns off all the fuel in the lines. 
   *** IT IS IMPERATIVE TO FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE ***
If one simply turns the heater knob to the off position, it will trap trap 100 PSI of propane in the accessory hose. When high pressure propane sits in the rubber hose, it will chemically react with the rubber and leetch a light oil. The oil will build up and quickly work its way into the heater, clogging both the regulator & control valve. 
Another very important recommendation is to purchase the gas line filter.  This will catch the oily residue and protect the combustion components of the heater should one forget to follow the precautions above.
Keeping these precautions in mind, one will be able to enjoy a very well-build and flexible-use portable heater.

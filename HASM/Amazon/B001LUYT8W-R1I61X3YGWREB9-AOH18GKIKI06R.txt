Title: Great little unit
Content:
What a great little unit. I wasn't expecting much to honest just something to help a little with the cold WI winters and the high heating bills. I have the 1500 model hoping to keep the living room warm on my 1600 sq. ft home. I was amazed how it did this and more. I have 3 bedrooms upstairs and as long as I kept the doors open it did a nice job of even warming them from downstairs. If people think you just turn it on and instant heat your living in a dream world. It takes time, not overly long either but it does take a bit. Very very quiet. Just bought another smaller unit for my daughter that she also just loves.

Title: Awesome laptop
Content:
I personally love Apple just because I don't like Microsoft, but this laptop really is nice. I don't really like huge laptops like the 17 inch laptops and 15 inch. I do recommend that you get the newer 13 inch Macbook Pro. It's like $200 more than the price on this here on Amazon, though. It's battery lasts longer than this and is a little faster and has a SD port, but you can always go and buy an SD reader like I did. Bottom line- great computer. Snow Leopard will be $29!!! But guess what. If you buy a Mac after June 8th, you get Snow Leopard for $10! Cool, huh? I still have to get mine for $29, even though I bought mine in late May :-/

Title: Awesome!
Content:
I am amazed at the amount of pet hair this vacuum picks up!  I owned a Kirby for many years and got tired of not having on-board tools.  My husband protested buying a new vacuum because of the amount of money we paid for the Kirby.  I finally insisted on getting a new vacuum because the pet hair on my furniture and carpet was getting out of control!  I own two black labs and a beagle.  All have the short hair that seems weave itself into fabric!  This vacuum is AWESOME!  It picks up dog hair like you wouldn't believe and the on-board tools are so convenient.  My only complaint is that it is heavy.  I guess I should look at it like a workout and enjoy the extra calories burned!!

Title: Brew temperature way too low.  Big disappointment.
Content:
I bought this Cuisinart Thermal Grind & Brew to replace my previous non-Thermal model, also a Cuisinart Grind & Brew.  Having had my first G&B for four years and really liked it, I expected the Thermal model to be a great step-up.  I also thought the extra $50 for the Thermal in stainless was a good deal.  The machine makes a great-tasting cup of coffee - no question about it.  It is also a nice looking piece of equipment.  However, it has one major and highly disappointing flaw.  The coffee is simply brewed at too cool a temperature.  Immediately after brewing, the coffee is hardly hot.  'Very warm' is probably the best way to describe it.  And keep in mind that as this is machine uses a thermal carafe, there is no 'hot plate' to further heat the coffee after it is first brewed.  The carafe is all that maintains the temperature of the coffee, and it does an excellent job in that regard.  But as the coffee is only 'very warm' in the first place, it's moot.  'Very warm' in to the carafe, 'very warm' out.The machine does feature a '1-4 Cup' button that supposedly heats the water to a higher temperature before brewing.  I've taken to using this all the time, regardless of the brew size.  It seems to make no difference to the temperature whatsoever.As I mentioned at the start of this review, the machine brews a great tasting cup of coffee.  However, the fact that I have to microwave each mug I pour for a full 60 seconds kind of knocks the enjoyment out of it.  I expected more from Cuisinart.

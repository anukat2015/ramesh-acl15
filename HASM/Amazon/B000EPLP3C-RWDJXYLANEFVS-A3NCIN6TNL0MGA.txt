Title: Attractive Product that Back-Stabs the Consumer in 2 Ways
Content:
Zune is clearly an attractive package in terms of interface and sound quality but Microsoft has, with this product, betrayed the consumer in two ways: First, Microsoft didn't fulfill its promise to allow customers to trade all their iPod songs, for free, for their Zune. Clearly, when the reality of this "trade" hit Microsoft, they back-tracked. Second, a percentage of all sales goes to Universal based on the presumption that Zune owners are going to steal music. This is a horrible precedent, to charge customers based on the theory that they use MP3 players to steal. Now will other companies have a hidden "steal" charge? Such a flagrant disrespect and betrayal of the customer should repel everyone from the Zune. If the Zune fails, the public wins.

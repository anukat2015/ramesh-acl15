Title: Do not buy this HP!!!
Content:
This machine was adorable, until it died after three months. The hard drive just failed.  It is now lost somewhere in Texas...under warranty, but HP sent it to the wrong address and doesn't seem to be able to find it. Their service is beyond horrible.  You call somewhere in India, who calls Texas, and I am not sure which is less in touch with reality.  
My next computer will be a Mac...or purchased from some company who has a clue.

Title: I love this coffeemaker!
Content:
This is the 3rd Bunn Coffeemaker I've owned in the last 8 years.  The first one was given to me as a gift, and I've been hooked ever since.  I can't imagine waiting for more than 3 minutes for a fresh pot of cofffee ever again.  I don't care for all the fancy machines out there with all the buttons and gizmos.  Who needs all that nonsense?  Give me a reliable, fast, and easy to use machine, that's easy to maintain and makes a great pot of cofffee to use everyday,and I'll be a happy camper for life!

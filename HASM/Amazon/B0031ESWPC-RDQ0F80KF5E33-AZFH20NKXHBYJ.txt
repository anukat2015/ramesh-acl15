Title: Great Tablet for a Budget Price
Content:
I've had the HP touchsmart 1070-us tm2 from amazon for almost 4 weeks now and I'm loving it.  I've never owned a tablet before but was eyeing them for about 6 mos before I bought this one.  I ordered in on a monday and received in on a thursday, even though I chose free shipping.  The tablet itself works great.  It's fast enough to stream videos from youtube and hulu without stalling out provided I have a good connection, of course).  I've been using it to take notes in class too.  By using One note, I can take hand written notes and even copy drawings without skipping a beat.  I used to use a regualar laptop to take notes and was always annoyed when I couldn't duplicate diagrams that the teachers would occasionally use.
I haven't experienced anyquality issues.  No overheating, no dead pixels, nothing like that.  So I don't have a comment on teh customer service isse that other people have been experiencing.
Battery life is less than expected:  I get about 4.5 - 5 hours of use without plugging it in and streaming music or video the whole time, and with the screen turned to 80% brightness.
If I could, I would rather the screen be matte to avoid some serious glare issues.  But I understand a smooth screen is better if you are going to have a touch screen with a stylus/digitizer (friction issues otherwise).  
Also, the keyboard takes some getting used to, because sometimes it appears to miss some of my key strokes.
But, overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

Title: Great Player, very easy to use
Content:
I've only had it about a month and it is my first MP3.  However, I am a shopper and spent a lot of time on the internet investigating and reading user reviews, product specs, product ads, manufacturer web-sites and magazine reviews.  I finally settled on this Zen which satisfies my personal needs.  It is packed with features and performs beautifully.  The menu is easy to navigate and although a sensitive touch pad, easy to get used to.  I use Rhapsody software which works flawlessly transferring music to the Zen from my PC.  The FM works well, I bought it for my wife during gardening and she loves it.

Title: I love my Zen V Plus.
Content:
I experienced some of the problems that other users griped about when I got the Zen V Plus.  Updating the firmware and a little patience seemed to do the trick however.  Now it works great, and I love the bookmark feature.  I listen to the NYT during the morning commute and various books on the evening commute.  The bookmarks let me keep my place on multiple books simultaneously, so I can choose what I want to listen to based on my mood, etc.  I only gave it 4 of 5 stars because of the initial problems I had, plus the owner's manual is pretty weak.  I had to get some clarification from Creative's tech support, but they responded within a day or so.  If you like listening to audiobooks, this MP3 player is a must have.  I love mine.

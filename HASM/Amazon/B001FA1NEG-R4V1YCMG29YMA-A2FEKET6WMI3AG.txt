Title: ok, except for iTunes needing gift or credit card for account.
Content:
Not much more to be said about the iPod. Great user interface. iTunes was somewhat of a pain to install on windows though. Also don't like how you need to have a credit card or gift card to set up an iTunes account. Can't download album art and stuff without an iTunes account. So, what are kids supposed to do? Sort of forces you to get them a gift card with their iPod. Looses 1 star for that.

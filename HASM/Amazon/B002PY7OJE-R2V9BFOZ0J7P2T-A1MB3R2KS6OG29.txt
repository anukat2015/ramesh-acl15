Title: Better than early press reviews
Content:
The early press reviews loved the performance but hated the track pad. Well the track pad issue seems fixed you need to go to the Dell website and install the updated drivers. The trackpad once you set it for your personal taste works fine. The hidden buttons on it though are harder than most to press.
The specs on Amazon are correct but mine also can with the 6 cell battery (a Dell $120.00 option)
I'm am extremely pleased with this purchase. For the money this is a bargain in the Culv Ultralight and thin category.

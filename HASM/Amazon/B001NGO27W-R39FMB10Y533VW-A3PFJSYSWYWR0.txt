Cuisinart DCC-2600 Brew Central 14-Cup Coffeemaker
So far I'm very happy with it.  Previous Cuisinart owner, this is an upgrade from the 12 cup version DCC-1200.  Very user friendly, easy poor Carafe, water gauge on side, uses same water filters as DCC-1200, and makes excellent coffee.  We use pre-filtered water to make the coffee, makes a big difference over tap water. The carafe is the same height as the 12-cup version but is larger in diameter, you will notice when filled, it is slightly heavier than the 12 cup (obviously). Comes with Gold Tone Coffee basket filter, a water filter, coffee spoon, few paper basket filters, plus the instruction book, and the usual manufacturer propaganda literature...LOL
My only very "minor" gripes: I miss the on/off toggle switch from the DCC-1200.  Not the fastest coffee maker out there, average 10-15 minutes for 10 - 14 cups of coffee. (Bunn coffee makers are much faster, but they make horrible coffee..yuck.) Very short power cord, if you need an extension cord, use one rated same as unit or higher, see instruction book... DCC-1200 had real Stainless Steel exterior, DCC-2600 is faux S/S(plastic)*, *this is the reason I gave 4 not 5 stars..
If you value good coffee, need more than 12-cups, and don't have Donald Trump's wallet, then I recommend this product!!

Title: My favorite vacuum!
Content:
I bought this model at another big box retailer 5 years ago. I love it. I bought one for my Mom and had it shipped to Hawaii! and I am thinking of buying myself another one. I have serious allergies and cats, and it works wonders. You can brush out filter, hit it on a rock outside or wash it, but if it doesn't get totally dried out, it will smell.

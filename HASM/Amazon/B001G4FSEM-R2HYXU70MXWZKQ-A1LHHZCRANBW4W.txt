Title: Great heater but Overpriced.
Content:
I bought this heater 6-7 years ago at the Home Depot for $20, regular price. It broke down and I refuse to pay $99.00 which IMO is overpriced. Considering it was used sparingly for 3 winters, that's not a good track record. There are many heaters just as good and much cheaper. A customer service number is not available as far as I know and that means no parts or repair center. I only gave it a 2 star rating due to the negatives.

Title: Don't buy this product!
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner for very lightweight use in my condo.  It worked fine for about 3 times, then suction became so bad on hardwood floors that I had to use the carpet mode.  Shortly after that the vacuum control stopped working altogether, and now the vacuum cleaner is useless.

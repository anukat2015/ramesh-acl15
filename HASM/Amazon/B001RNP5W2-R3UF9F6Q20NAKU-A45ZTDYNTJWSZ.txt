Title: Enjoying Refurbished
Content:
I received my refurbished 600. It looks like new with no scratches or mars. It works well, and I'm happy with it.  It's true that it doesn't come with a water filter (something I wouldn't use anyway), the reusable filter (ordered for $8.99), or the sample coffee. 
I have a question. It can be programmed to turn on and off, but it still requests that the head be lifted and the brew button be pushed. Is there a way to program it so that I can actually wake up to coffee actually already made?

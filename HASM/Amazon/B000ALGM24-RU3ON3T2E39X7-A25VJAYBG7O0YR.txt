Title: Easy to use, plastic could be higher quality
Content:
We purchased the Hunter 44550 a month ago to replace one of the old round non-digital thermostats and the Hunter has been very easy to use.  The installation was fairly easy; I encountered a slight problem because the thermostat I was replacing did not have the wires labeled.  Fortunately the Hunter installation manual had some wiring diagrams in the appendix and I was able to figure it out.  Programming the thermostat is very easy - much easier than another "H-brand" digital thermostat that we have in our house.  The one down side to the Hunter unit is the quality of the backing plate that mounts to the wall.  The plate flexes more than it probably should, hence I am only rating it 4-stars.  The thermostat we have from the other "H-brand" seems sturdier, but not as easy to program.  Minor gripe aside, I would buy this Hunter thermostat again (and I plan to because we have one more thermostat to replace).

Title: Big upgrade
Content:
I upgraded to the XSi from my original Canon Digital Rebel. I really love the new features on the XSi and the live view option. I also like the ability to connect to the computer and control from there.  Its a great entry in the Canon line of digital cameras.  And for the price, you can't beat it.

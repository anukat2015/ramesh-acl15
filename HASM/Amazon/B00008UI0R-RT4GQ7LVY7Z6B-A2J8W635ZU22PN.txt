Title: Hoover Electronic
Content:
There really was a lot I loved about this vacuum initially.  It's been less than a year, however,and now the on/off button is having serious problems.  Most of the time it doesn't turn on/off (or suction control,etc.) when you push it the first time.  What used to be just a little glitchy has now gotten to the point that I am too frustrated to vacuum, like when I've plugged and unplugged it several times and it still wont turn on.  I can tell it is not built to last too long in other ways as well.

Title: Not Recommended for Workouts
Content:
I bought a new iPod shuffle about a month ago for use during workouts.  I typically do about 90 minutes of intense aerobics about five times per week.  Bottom line is that sweat will destroy this product.  Mine stopped working abruptly.  Moreover, I had purchased this shuffle as a replacement for an earlier one that died the same way.    While it is true that moisture and electronics do not mix, one would have thought that Apple would have ruggedized this product, considering that most people buy it as a workout companion.

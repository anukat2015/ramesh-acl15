Title: Pathetic Packaging!!  Adequate performance
Content:
I am replacing a Sunpentown portable AC because of the noise it makes while running.  This model intrigued me because of the 39db rating and the movable louvers.
When received, the package wasn't damaged, but it was packed in some of the worse recycled cardboard on the planet!!  The unit was set into a flimsy styrofoam (probably also recycled material) base that was all broken.  The outside box was stapled to this flimsy base.  Two straps held the base to the top.  Incredibly poor packaging.  
Although the packaging was not pierced or crushed, it had apparently been dinged enough that the front plastic cover & louvers popped apart.  I cannot get them back together.  
Ironically, the weight - 97lbs- is printed on the top of the box.  This packaging cannot protect a pair of sneakers let alone a sensitive mechanical item.
It is working well, but I'm a bit wary if it got jostled too much in shipping & problems will show up later.  It is quiet and instantly blew frigid air.  I like the auto fan setting where it ramps up to get the temp under control, then back to low & slow.
A simple cardboard or virgin styrofoam collar around the middle of the unit to keep the box from being caved in during shipping would be 1000% better.  C'mon, LG - here is a perfect opening to blow Sharp out of the water on another appliance!

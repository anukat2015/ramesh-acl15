Title: Warm, Quiet, and Reliable -- for Years!
Content:
Since I got this Bionaire space warming heater a few years ago, in each cold season that followed, I have been enjoying its instant warmth, versatile adjustability and quietness.
Unlike my other smaller sized fan-driven heaters, it would not create a draft in the area, which could be irritating to people with dry eyes or allergy.
In addition, it is truly quiet & so easy to roll around on it's wheels!
I ordered another one today, for another room, for I found myself moving this nice heater between rooms too often already!
Just want more people to know about this superb heater:
Warming up fast, no fan or draft created, quiet, and allows you to adjust to the settings that you like, and my first one has been working well for years.
Highly recommended.

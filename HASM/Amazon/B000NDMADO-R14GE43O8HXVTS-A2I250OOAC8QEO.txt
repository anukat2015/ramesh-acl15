Title: DC21 Review- Didn't like it
Content:
I purchased the DC21 stowaway and just got in yesterday and to tell you the truth I was not impressed the design at all.  I had a DC14 Animal and loved it but wanted a 2nd Dyson to retire the other one. The canister has excellent suction power but cord is WAY to short and bin WAY to small for my 2 dog/2 cat household.  I really hated the vacuum wand, its too large and bulky and you cant disconnect the house from the wand which I like to do to really get deep into corners and vacuum table to dust. Also the attachments are kind of useless, they do not snap in they are merely held by suction  and attached to the end of bulky handle gun thingy, they felt wobbly and popped off several times. The house kept getting getting twisted and I just didn't like it all, not compared to the animal upright.   
If you really like to dust and get into nooks and crannys with a vacuum cleaner I would not recommend this product. I decided to return mine for the DC 25 animal.  I purchased the vacuum from [...], and they include a whole bunch of free tools, including a turbine head for free. I paid  [...] w/ free shipping and free turbine tool and angled brush, Great deal. I would highly recommend purchasing from this site, the customer service excellent!

Title: Nikon D200 Review
Content:
Camera has many features that make it quick to set up and shoot.  Most used functions are available via external switch with no need to drill down through menus.  You may not want to wear this camera around you neck, it is a bit on the heavy side.  It is easy to see the complete viewfinder while wearing glasses.  Manual mode is simple to use and the exposure adjustment is visible through the viewfinder just like a 35mm SLR.  Full program [auto] mode works very well.  I am overall, very pleased with this camera.

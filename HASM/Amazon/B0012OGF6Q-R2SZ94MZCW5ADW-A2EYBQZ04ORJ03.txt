Title: Nikon D60 Entry level DSLR
Content:
Loaded with features that matter for 1st timers the Nikon D60 DSLR comes with a image stabilized kit lens providing great capability right out of the box. ISO 1600 images that are actually useable, these are much better than ISO 1600 images from a pocket digi cam or super zoom models. I read alot of reviews about entry level DSLR's before buying. I chose the Nikon because I believed it is a better overall camera than the Sony DSLR's. The lens autofocus motor is very quiet, and the kit lens image quality is very good. The camera shoots multishot at 3 FPS, full 10mp images. Nice for amateur sports shooting, probably a bit slow for professional sports shooting but to get that capability you would pay alot more.
I am very happy with this camera.

I think this unit is very good im very happy ive shopped
and looked at other units and this was the best deal i could find ,the remote control and temp setting and 2 blower speeds are very nice ,also has a timmer feature 24 hr that other units didnt ,as far a noise it isnt that noticable ,not at all distracting i would consider it like a Hair drier blower on low in high speed mode ,i find it a convienience to have,and I'm very pleased to have it .keeping my room warm Yes saving on Electric bills . Yes

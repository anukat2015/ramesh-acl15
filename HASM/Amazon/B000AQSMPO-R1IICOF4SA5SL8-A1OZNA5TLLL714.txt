Title: Best coffee/tea maker we have owned
Content:
The k-cups make great coffee or tea and the selection is huge.  Being able to make a cup of coffee the way you want when you want it is great especially in a family of 4 coffee/tea drinkers.  I especially like the ability to make a single cup of decaf in the afternoon instead of wasting an entire pot.  Works as advertised and I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good coffee.  The only downside is that your price per cup is a little more expensive than a bag of store brand coffee would cost.

Title: The cutest space heater EVER!
Content:
I ordered this because I thought it was cute.  It was even better in person.  Not only is it attractive, but it strongly blows heat and the oscillating feature is a real plus.  Having a remote control is also nice because I can put the space heater anywhere.  People don't even realize it's in the room, they think they're walking past a planter or clay jar. Now, I get to enjoy my sunroom well into the fall and I look forward to getting back out there in the early spring.

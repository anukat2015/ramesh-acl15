Title: Great camera for the money
Content:
We ordered this camera instead of the D90 because it was simply about 300.00 cheaper.  Also, we have existing movie capability, therefore that extra chestnut was not of great value to us.  The D90 will do a few things that the D80 will not, but for us wannabes, this is a Super camera.
The operation is good, I like the way the modes are set up.  I've been taking several pictures in low light situations (one of the main reasons for getting a SLR camera...) and had good success.  It is quite versatile.  I had a question on some photo issues that I was having, and got a hold of their online help, and fairly quickly they steered me in the right direction.
All in all, We really enjoy the camera and look forward to lots of use.

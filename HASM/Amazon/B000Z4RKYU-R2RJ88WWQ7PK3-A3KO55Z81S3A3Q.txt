Title: Very good product
Content:
We got rid of our big coffee to purchase this smaller one, and it wasn't a disappointment.  It's small enough for our needs yet quite effective.  I like that it's compact, and can be programmed to make coffee at a future time.  We really like that the ground coffee never leaks into the coffee being poured due to its mesh inside already.
I didn't give it a 5 star because it can be a messy clean-up sometimes if the ground coffee steeps too high in the maker.  Other than that, we are pretty happy with it.  It's a very good product.

Title: Best Ever!
Content:
I've had this for a few months now, and absolutely LOVE it!  It's convient, fast, easy to use and makes the same wonderful cup of coffee every time!  The bottom is removable, so my 15 oz. travel cup fits perfectly underneath.  I don't like super strong coffee, so I use the same k-cup twice to fill my travel cup (using the middle brew setting).  I love that you can use this for coffee, tea or hot chocolate.  I also like the fact that I can use this machine for hot water for packets of hot chocolate.  Great product!

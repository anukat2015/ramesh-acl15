Title: Great A/C
Content:
I bought this AC after reading the 2 star review and I am very glad I did. I live in the college dorms and this AC does an excellent job cooling my room and I have not experienced any of the concerns posted by the other reviewer. I've got a few other friends with Portable A/C units and none work as well as this one.
The wheels roll fine on the dorm room carpet, I've had this A/C for over a month and have yet to empty the water tank, and this A/C gets my room as cold as I could ever want it, and could get it even colder if I so desired. 
I got this unit on sale for ~$230 and this has been a great investment.

Title: My first DSLR
Content:
I bought this camera body a couple of weeks ago together with the Sony Zeiss 16-80mm lens.  It is my first DSLR, with my most recent other camera being a Canon S2 IS superzoom point and shoot.  Have not used a SLR camera since before the digital age.  Am very happy with it!  Image quality, as you'd expect, is *far* above that of the S2 IS... and there aren't any image quality issues that I can determine relative to other DSLRs.  Resolution seems great, color is spot-on, etc.
Ergonomically, I'm also very happy.  As I get back into using things like aperture and shutter speed settings, I find the controls to be well laid out and accessible.  The Live View implementation is very easy to use...admittedly, I wish I could live-view things like depth of field et al, but for my uses, I don't really miss it.  My only complaint is that when I hold the camera, occasionally my hand will press up against the AF directional-pad and alter the AF setting.
At the moment, I can't really imagining needing anything more complex than this camera.  I'm sure that a pro photographer will want the flexibility of more lenses et al.  But for me, I don't see myself needing a whole collection of lenses...maybe one more bigger zoom lens or something like that.

Title: Lasko Heater
Content:
After drooling hours of reading reviews and comparing heaters I finally settled on this little heater. I received it very quickly with no packaging issues (purchased from Amazon.com), the item was intact and operational. 30-45 minutes after turning it on, our living room and family room was noticeably warmer. After about an hour we had to turn it down to it's lowest setting, which maintained the two rooms very well. I have now been running it almost non-stop for the last three weeks now and it is still running strong!

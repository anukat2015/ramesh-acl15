Title: Terrible customer service!!! after sending me a refurb product with a missing part instead of a new one...
Content:
Here is the email i just sent to Amazon.
Terrible customer service... :(
Just a short email to tell you how upset i am about your services. After waiting 9 days and after opening a box where the part of the vacuum were dirty (the girl on the phone told me it was a return vacuum) ... i realised that they were one part missing, I called your customer service who told me that the replacement was impossible because i erased the credit card info. Obvisouly during Xmas people have present and my dad used his credit card info to pay my vacuum and i didnt want to keep that info on my account. So I have to send back the item because of YOUR fault and i cant even have an exchange in the next few days. Here is what i have to do, i have to send you the vacuum, wait that your company received it. btw i live in NY and you are in Denver... Then you will send me a refund on that credit card, which is not even mine because it was present and then you will send me as a gift card some money on it to buy another vacuum and going back to the beginning.
Hopefuly this time i'll have a new one without any part missing, who knows...
However i will have to wait, without even mentionning the inconvenience of making sure to be home for fed ex pick up/delivery, About 3/4 weeks to buy and receive my vacuum that hopefully will work. 
As a new customer, I'm very disappointed by your services.
I hope that you will take note of my case.

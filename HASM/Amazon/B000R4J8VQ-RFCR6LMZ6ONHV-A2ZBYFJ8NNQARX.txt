Title: Slow and of poor quality
Content:
I bought this to brew pod coffee .. it brewed very slowly but did make 'decent' coffee .. that is, until it died after only a few months of use (it was used only a few times per week!) .. save your twenty bucks and invest in something that will save time and last longer. And the top area gets really hot so don't get near it while it's brewing unless you want a second degree burn.

Title: HP DV6 1250 Review (US)
Content:
Awesome product, I am very pleased. Nice performance and the hardware is great. Just be careful using Bluetooth Mouses from Microsoft on it, makes crash the Quick Start functions.
Also, the battery last only like 2.5 hours, but considering the size and the processing power of the laptop, I say that's not an issue.
Cheers !!

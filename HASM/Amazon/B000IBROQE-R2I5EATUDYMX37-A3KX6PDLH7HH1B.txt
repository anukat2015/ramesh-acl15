Title: Zen vs. Ipod
Content:
My girlfried got this player as a christmas present. She also got an Ipod Nano that had pretty much the same features. She sat down with both in order to put some music on them. She spent about 15 minutes and had her Zen in full working order with her entire library of songs loaded. As for the Ipod, she ended up struggling for over an hour and ended up calling it quits. The Zen works perfectly well and does everything she needs it to, and the Ipod is a paperweight.

Title: Average picture quality and construction....
Content:
Without elaborating too much I'll just say I was mostly disappointed.
Primarily I was annoyed at the sloppy lens mount which twisted/clicked everytime I zoomed...Started out at about 1/32" play and increased to 1/16"...Then I started receiving lens connection errors...
The autofocus was back focusing and even manually adjusting for that the resolution was just average for a $1500 camera...Even in RAW...Obviously I had a somewhat duff camera but with reading many reviews and some of them mentioning the loose lens mount I decided to abandon any further testing and just send it back...
Because of the lens problems I didn't bother with any videos as this aspect of the camera is secondary to me...
I did really like the rubberized body,the articulating screen and the VERY bright/sharp EVF...For a non DSLR that view is Superb in this stage of EVF development...I also like the whole 4/3 concept but I'll wait until a GH2 and try again...

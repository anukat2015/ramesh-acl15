Title: Hunter Fan 44360 Thermostat - Very Pleased!
Content:
This thermostat saved me $500 by illiminating my heat recycling problem caused by the old mercury thermostat!  I'm very glad I installed it before anything else.
It makes a clicking sound when stopping or starting the heat.  It's reaffirming to me when hearing it that the heat is either off or on.  It's a soft click so it's hardly noticable.
The features are simple to understand and implement.
The battery warning feature puts me at ease concerning using batteries.  It also remembers the programmed schedule when changing the batteries for a whole one minute.  I put in some nearly dead batteries and it still worked!  So new batteries should last at least a year or two.

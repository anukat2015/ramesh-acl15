Title: Great first DSLR
Content:
I bought this camera mainly because of the favorable reviews in magazines/ online forums. The four thirds format promises a smaller/lighter camera body. I really like the idea of in-body anti-shake so I can use lighter/less expensive lens as I grow as a amateur photographer. The camera offers a lot of features, such as art filter mode. For me, I don't care and seldom use the filter mode, because you can be much more creative inside lightroom and photoshop. It's best to get a clear photo to begin with. Overall, I love this camera. Great build quality. Plus, you can swap CF card with the camera mounted to a tripod since the compartment for the CF card is on the side rather the bottom as most other cameras.

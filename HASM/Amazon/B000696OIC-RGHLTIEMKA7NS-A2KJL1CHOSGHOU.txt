Title: Great Quality and Style
Content:
Are you tired of parts made of plastic and not real metal? This coffee maker is made of genuine brushed stainless.  If the part on this machine looks like metal, it is metal.  The overall look and style is very European, even the buttons and display are good quality and simple to use and understand.  The carafe is stainless inside and out, and keeps the coffee hot for at least 4 hours.  The water resevoir lifts out for easily filling from the tap, so you don't have to fill the carafe first and pour it into the machine.  The resavoir has graduated markings.  Also, the filter holder comes out for easy cleaning.  The only quirk I found is that, as with other themal carafes, you have to pour slowly to keep from dripping.  It also helps to read the manual that explains how far to unscrew the top before pouring to avoid drips.

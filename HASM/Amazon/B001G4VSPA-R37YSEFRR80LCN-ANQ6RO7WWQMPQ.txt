Title: The best heater money can buy! We own 4!
Content:
My family has been using these heaters for the last several years (3-4). They work magnificently and heat up a room quickly and silently. In the past, we have had other space heaters that lasted only a season. 
I will say that we had one of these heaters malfunction within the 1-year warranty period, and when we called Bionaire they sent out a replacement immediately after I faxed them proof-of-purchase. Then they sent a postage-prepaid carton for me to return the problem unit for analysis. They were just so professional on the phone. I was extremely impressed by this company that really stands behind its products. All of our other Bionaire Micathermic Heaters have been functioning flawlessly, and we use them a LOT.
I just recommended this to my daughter for her apartment.

Title: Great suction but too bulky for me.
Content:
This machine is like a monster.  It has its own life and sucks up dust and hair like a crazy monster.  It's especially great on carpet.   The only negative thing about this machine is that it's too bulky.  I don't buy upright vacuum because they tend to be too heavy for me but this one feels like I am cleaning with a upright vacuum...something to consider.

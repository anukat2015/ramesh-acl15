Title: Same problem twice!
Content:
I received the vac promptly and in good packaging from amazon.  What I got was a heavy and, at first glance, a well built machine.  However, when I tried to put it away after use I found that the cord return spring was faulty and didn't work betond pulling the cord halfway back.
I contacted amazon and got a replacement within days which is the kind of service I've come to expect from amazon.  The trouble was that the replacement had exactly the same problem!  In fact this cord doesn't return at all.
I'm avoiding Hoover from now on.

Title: awesome player for everything
Content:
This player is great for podcast lovers. It's small and the screen is amazing. because it's so thin and the pixel density is so high, this ipod feels especially refined. audio quality is pretty good for normal people. battery life is good. software a little buggy tho--it freezes sometimes

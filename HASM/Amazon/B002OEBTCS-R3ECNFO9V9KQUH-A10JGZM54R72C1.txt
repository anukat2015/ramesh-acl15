Title: Hits sweet spot in price/performance/features
Content:
This is my first DSLR; my experience includes years of shooting film SLRs and digital point-and-shoots. After a month of shooting a few hundred photos I'm pleased with the K-x. The kit (body + 18-55mm and 50-300mm DA lenses) is a great package for under $700. The automatic and preprogrammed modes are sufficient for those graduating from point-and-shoot cameras to take good photos immediately. The kit lenses are surprisingly good, and at the bundled price they are a no-brainer.
I immediately upgraded the firmware to v1.01 and was happy to discover that the installer included a Mac OS X version, which worked like a charm. I've seen no evidence of the early reported battery problems; I'm using the Sanyo Eneloop 2000 mAh and have not recharged yet.
Nothing is perfect, and the K-x does lag a bit in image stabilization in low light, but I suspect others do, too. Since I had experience with different brands of digital cameras I haven't had much difficulty with the interface and layout, but if you're a long-time user of another DSLR brand you'll probably need to practice more.
I was originally considering the Micro 4/3 format cameras, but after reading others' reviews of the K-x I decided to go the DSLR route. The K-x is comparatively light and compact, but feels solid, and the performance and features at this price are unmatched.
Photo quality has been good to excellent, the most challenging shots I've experienced were macro shots outdoors in the shade, in which a tripod is an absolute necessity. Focus distance with the 18-55mm is close and lens is fast enough for decent work of this type.

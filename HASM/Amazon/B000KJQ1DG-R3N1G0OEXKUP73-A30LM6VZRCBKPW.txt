Title: Great photos out of the box
Content:
Having been thru a short series of point & shoot digital cameras, I was mentally ready to move up to a DSLR. Fortunately for my pocketbook, the D40 offers tremendous value for the money. I'm not a complete novice at photography, but at this point would not even call myself a serious amateur.   The D40 gives me a relatively simple-to-use camera, with considerable more flexibility than my old P&S cameras.  Even on Auto settings straight out of the box, it takes very, very good photos. First week I had it, took the family to a local park to shoot fall portraits.  Whether in bright sunlight, or a shady, wooded hiking path, the camera handled the exposures very well in Portrait mode.  Also shot some simple landscapes and was extremely impressed with them as well. The 18-55mm kit lens offers good optics in a nice focal length range, lightweight lens. Indoor default setting flash shots were impressive as well. May eventually purchase a Speedlight flash for it, but the built-in flash does a nice job for now. Battery performance appears to be very good, and I love the light weight and form factor of the camera body. Next accessory in line for this camera is Nikon's 55-200mm AF-S zoom lens, which would really help complete my kit. Overall, a terrific camera for the price.

Title: Cute, but won't stay together
Content:
This vacuum is adorable and cleans my hardwood floors well enough. Unfortunately, the hose has a tendency to disconnect from the vacuum head, which turns a normal household chore into an exercise in frustration. You vacuum for a bit and then have to try to reconnect it all. I can't say I'd recommend this vacuum to anyone unless they are just looking for a cute bulbous orange prop for their home.

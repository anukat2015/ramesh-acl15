Title: Bunn Coffee Maker is the best one I've tried
Content:
I love this coffee maker. To me, a stainless steel internal tank is better than heating the water in plastic type tanks. (There is something about heating water in plastic that freaks me out...it can't be healthy drinking.) The coffee this product produces tastes great. It is quick brewing. I have had other coffee makers go belly up in less than a year. I think this one will last because I once years ago had a different Bunn and used it throughout the day and night 24-7 for sixteen years before it bit the dust.

Title: Good heater for a bedroom
Content:
I've had this heater for about a week and it works very well.  It's silent and heats the room evenly.  The instructions are poorly written and don't really say much about the ComforTemp button.  All it says is that it is factory preset to reach and maintain a suggested & preset ideal energy-saving temp.  It doesn't say what that temp is.  Other than that I'm pleased with this heater.

Title: Just what I was looking for........
Content:
This woodstove pipe thermometer is almost exactly like the one it replaced (also by Condar) which finally broke after 19 years.  Hope this one lasts as long.  It was the best priced of all thermometers I looked at. Easy to see temperature ranges marked "best operation", "too hot", etc.

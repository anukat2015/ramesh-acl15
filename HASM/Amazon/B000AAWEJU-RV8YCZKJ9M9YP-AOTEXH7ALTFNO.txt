Title: Best Vacuum Ever!!
Content:
We just got this and are thrilled!!  This I guess is how a vacuum should work!  Wonderfully easy and light!  Picks up everything!!  We have a 7-800 sqft. apt with some rugs.  It is perfect and small enought to store in a small closet.  It was also extremely easy to get started.  Sent by Witbeck's and just had to plug in and go!

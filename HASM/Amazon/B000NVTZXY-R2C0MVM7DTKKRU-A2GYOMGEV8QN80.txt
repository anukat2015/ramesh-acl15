Title: Smaller SLR with my e-410
Content:
In my view before you buy, you must understand 2 things: smaller SLRs and it's good for travel.
I've had e-410 system about 2 weeks.It made it easy for me to carry it.It seems to produce the good picture / good image  but some picture wasn't good because i try to take a good picture ;-).(the battery performance was very good )
The 40-150 len is very good for me.It used for tele picture.
Overall ,I would say this is a resonable price...and the telephoto lens is very good.

Cons. Last weekend I took it to a birthday party at night.The images was bad because i didn't have the external flash.Maybe the external flash is is important for you

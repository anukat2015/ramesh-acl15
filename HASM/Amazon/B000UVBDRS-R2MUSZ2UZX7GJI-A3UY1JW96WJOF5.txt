Title: Very nice, after a short "getting to know you" period.
Content:
I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas.  I gave it to him early so he'd have time to put all of his music on it and get it organized prior to the holidays.  We were both surprised by how very small and light it is--it's very sleek and very portable.
We had some trouble getting started, though.  The device frozen in the middle of a transfer, and then the computer stopped recognizing it for a while.  We had to unplug it, wait for the battery to run out, then plug it back into the computer before it would work again.  This actually happened several times, and with two separate computers.  Maybe there's just a learning curve, though, because after we got the bulk of the music transferred over, it started working just fine.  
I'd recommend this to anyone who is patient and not easily frustrated by minor (but time consuming) technical difficulties.

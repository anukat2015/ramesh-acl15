Title: KEURIG
Content:
Speedy coffee, almost instant.  Heats water very fast.  Does vibrate due to the pump.  Pumps water from reservoir into machine to be heated, will get noisy.  Choose between 2 cup sizes.  Will fit a TRAVEL MUG(YES!), just remove drip tray.  Low water, descale, heating, cup size indicators(lights) and auto off button.  Easy to use and prime.  Pretty sturdy plastic, don't force handle for K-cup, too much force I could see it breaking.  Hopfully the pump will last, that is my only consern in the long run.  Keurig is innovative and worth looking into.

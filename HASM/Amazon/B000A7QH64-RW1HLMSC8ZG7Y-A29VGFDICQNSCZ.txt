Title: Too much filter changing
Content:
I bought this vacuum to clean the cat hair off of my two fabric sofas.  I only own one cat, and the shark did get most of the pet hair after 2-3 passes, but I had to take the filter and clean it out three times during one cleaning session.  I found this to be quite time consuming, especially since the battery started to loose steam as I got half way through the second couch.  
Pluses: Will pick up cat hair and is cordless
Minuses: Filter constantly needs to be cleaned and the battery life is suspect.

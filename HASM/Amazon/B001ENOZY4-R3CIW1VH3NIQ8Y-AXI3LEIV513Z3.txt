Title: Best camera I have ever had!!!!
Content:
I read somewhere that autofocus on the D90 is slow. Maybe those people don't know how to use a camera.
Auto focus on this baby is lighting fast. It will shoot all the frames you want in a second, and all of the pictures will be correctly exposed and sharp focused.
Is my first DSLR, I had film SLR for years (pentax, Nikon, Canon) I had several digital cameras (Sony, Canon). But this one without any doubts is the best one by far.
Thanks Nikon!!

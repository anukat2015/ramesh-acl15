Title: Bosch Tassimo machine stopped working
Content:
I purchased the new Bosch Tassimo Suprema TAS 4511UC, from an an authorized retail store and registered it online. The machine stopped working a few days later when a tdisc exploded in the machine. On 9/22/08, I called TassimoDirect, the machine's service agent. The service representative, Dennis, promised that a new replacement machine would be sent because the machine could not be fixed. The TassimoDirect Customer Service is terrible. I cannot tell you how many times I've called TassimoDirect since 9/22 to find out why I haven't been sent a replacement machine, as promised. I've spoken to Nathan, Jessica, Shauna, Andrea, etc. Today is 11/5 and I still have not been sent a replacement machine. Each time I call for service, all I'm given is excuses. I would definitely think twice before purchasing this machine. Today a Product Specialist at TassimoDirrect named Mona said she'd call me tomorrow to update me. Mona has already verified that no replacement was ever sent to me, but all I'm getting is phone calls to tell me that nobody knows why the machine has not been sent!!!!! Although I paid $139.95 for the new, "improved" model, it is not working nor do I have a replacement.

Title: More than pleased....
Content:
This product far exceeded my expectations. After comparison shopping for quite some time, I purchased the Creative Labs Zen X-Fi 2 8 GB MP3 player, and am so thrilled about it that I plan to buy four more as X-mas gifts for my family. I absolutely love the touchscreen, and the audio sounds very nice and clean with no distortion. I've purchased five MP3 players and have finally found one with the sound quality I've been looking for. I've been an avid Amazon shopper for the past several years and have never taken the time to write a review on a single product I've purchased, but this one truly is worth chiming in on. I very highly recommend this MP3 player to anyone looking to make sure their dollars are spent wisely. If you've been shopping around, look no further! This is the one you've been looking for....

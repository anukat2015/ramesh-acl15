Title: Awesome
Content:
This thing is awesome- app store, itunes, you name it, its goi it!(except for calling but it does have contacts! And a camera). I love mine- I cant seem to keep my hands off the brilliant touch screen. It has an app for everyone. Coloring-has it. Action-has it. Community-has it. My favorite games are Tap Tap Revenge 1&2. I also have Lady Gaga Revenge. I also have Rollercoaster Rush, fun game, Deer Hunt 3D free, fun, and lots more. They have an app to fill your every need. Sweet! Plays music great. Can hold as many songs as you would ever need. 
My only complaint- it needs wifi for all the cool stuff. My friend has one but no wifi, so all she does on hers is play music. If your looking for just a music player, go with a Nano or Shuffle.

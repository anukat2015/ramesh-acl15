Title: Keeps us snug as bugs
Content:
I have used a unit similar to this one for years.  Over the past two years my friend and I have had a small...well shack, down by a nearby lake with no electricity, plumbing or anything modern.  It does have a small wood cook stove and a nice soft bunk which is about all we need, to be real honest.  We have been using an old portable heater such as this one which was made somewhere in Europe in the late 1950s which finally sort of rusted out.  We bought one of these Sengokus in hopes of replacing our beloved old heater.  It worked!  We have had not problems what so ever.  It keep the small cabin (One and ½ rooms) perfectly warm and we are quite snug between it and the old quilts we use.  It is easy to carry and pack in, easy to maintain and suits our needs perfectly.  If and when we ever get real heating in the place, something I doubt, I am sure she and I will be able to find some other use for it.  I really very much recommend this one.  I will say though that if you are not familiar with this sort of heater, you need to read the directions quite closely and do a bit of experimentation on your own.

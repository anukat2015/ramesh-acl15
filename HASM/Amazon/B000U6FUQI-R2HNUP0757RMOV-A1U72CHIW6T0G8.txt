Title: Has made my life much easier
Content:
I love this product! I use it in my kitchen where I leave it parked in a corner.  Anytime there's some dirt tracked in, I just grab the Kruz.  It's so much easier than using a broom and it works better, too (you can never get that last little bit of dust in the dustpan!)  And it's way better than pulling out the big electric vacuum and having to deal with the cord and weight, etc.  It maneuvers so easily and is the best vacuum I've ever had for getting in the corners. This Kruz is just perfect for what I use it for.  
I do have to say that I've only had it less than a month, so I don't know how it holds up over time. It seems like it's sturdily built, and have no reason to think it won't last for years.

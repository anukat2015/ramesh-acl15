Title: Best Heater We Have Ever Owned
Content:
By far beats every other heater I've experienced.  
One fellow mentions the grill blocks some of the heat and yes, this may be true and possible to overcome but the product could not be released at this pricepoint if they did some more high-tech solution and it would suck if they used bars like the old fashioned radiants did.
It heats my bedroom well even on low, the back handle could be designed better, comes with a long warranty, heats the air more gently than space heaters, I will take manual controls ANY DAY over unreliable electronic ones.  
What else can I say?

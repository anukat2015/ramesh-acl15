Title: Excellent Unit at a Low Price
Content:
I bought this unit to replace an old Hunter model that was more than ten years old. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of useful features and improvements over the earlier model. It was easy to install and program. The backlight feature is especially nice when I want to make an adjustment late at night without waking others.

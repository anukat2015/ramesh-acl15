Title: A Great Camera That Converted Me From Film
Content:
This camera is finally the one that got me to give up my beloved EOS-1 35mm and go digital.  With film processing stores closing left and right, I was looking for a digital camera that would give me all the creative options of film, but wouldn't cost a fortune.  The rebel fills the bill nicely.  Complete control over ISO, white balance, saturation, sharpness and color temperature give me all the power I need to take the pictures I want.  10 megapixel resolution gives me better images than scanned slides, too.  The final straw was finding out that this camera has mirror lock-up, something my EOS-1 lacked.  I was sold.
Canon really improved things over the last Rebel.  Controls are more intuitive, the 2.5 inch LCD is bright and clear, and the appearance is vastly improved.  The grip still needs to be bigger, but I bought the optional battery grip to solve that problem.  After installing the battery grip, I now would consider it a "must have" item.
I hated the idea of going digital.  I was proud of being one of the few film users around here.  But I can't argue with the facts:  Digital pictures are now just as good, and much more convenient.  
Pros:  Sharp, beautiful pictures; great features and controls for the money; creative features usually not found in entry-level DSLR's.
Cons:  Small size makes it difficult to hold steady; the price has dropped twice since I bought it (ARGGGGH!).

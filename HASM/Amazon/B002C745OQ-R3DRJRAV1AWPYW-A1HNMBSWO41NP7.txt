Title: Laptop is fine, service is a joke
Content:
As a long-time (20+ years) PC user, I had to buy a Mac to develop apps for the iPhone. Although the keyboard is still more limited than I would like, I was able to become accustomed to the "Apple" way of getting things done (function follows form with them). The hardware is nice and solid, although one expects that for something costing twice as much as the competition. However, Apple customer care is sadly lacking, and you'll get differing answers when you ask about getting a repair. For them, the customer is always wrong.

Title: you can't go wrong with a vornado
Content:
You definately can't go wrong with this heater.  I think it's more cost efficient than a centralized heater when you want to keep a room or small area warm.  Unlike other heaters, it runs continuously keeping the temperature at a certain level throughout the room or area.  It never gets hot to the touch, so safety isn't much of an issue.  It circulates warm air thoughout the room so efficiently that the position of the heater is arbitrary.  You can point the fan at the wall and still heat the entire room efficiently.

Title: Great Coffee!
Content:
We bought this coffeemaker to replace one we had for over 5 years.  We almost replaced with the same brand but decided to go with this one to try a different brand.  My husband loves the toggle for on/off and we love that we can program it to make coffee just before we wake up and have coffee waiting for us in the morning.  Really easy to use and program but it didn't come with a gold filter and we have to pull the coffeemaker out from under the upper cabinet to fill the water reservoir.  All in all, we love this coffeemaker and we would buy it again!

Title: I love this coffeemaker
Content:
I was hesitant to buy this coffeemaker due to the bad reviews I read but I saw other reviews that said they didn't understand why there were bad reviews.  I have to say that I have used this coffeemaker for 2 weeks now with absolutely NO problems!  I've used ground coffee and whole beans and never experienced the problem that other people stated.  I don't understand the bad reviews except maybe it was a defective product because I bought a refurbished one and it works like a charm and makes excellent coffee with great flavor!  I highly recommend this despite what you've read from others!!

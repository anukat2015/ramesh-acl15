Title: We have 6 of these in our offices.  They're greyt!
Content:
Over the years, we've acquired SIX of these units for our hermetically sealed offices.  We have no windows that can be opened and the building temperature will vary from 63 degrees to 85 degrees from one day to the next.  We're on the 5th floor and have nowhere to vent units to the outside.  Yes, these units have 4" discharge hoses that need to vent away from the space being heated or cooled but we solved the problem by installing venting into the dropped ceilings and the hot air or cold air being discharged by the units goes into the space above the ceiling panels.  Not a perfect solution, but it works well to make the office work space tolerable when the building HVAC system goes haywire.
I've found these units to be relatively quiet and very efficient.  Because they are multi-purpose (heat, air conditioner, fan and dehumidifier), they are useful year round.  We'd just be miserable without them.  YES, you do have to drain the units if your space is extremely humid but it's not a huge hassle.  We generally only have to do this occasionally when the building humidity level jumps unusually high.
I heartily recommend the Amcor 12,000 BTU portable air conditioners for supplemental climate control.

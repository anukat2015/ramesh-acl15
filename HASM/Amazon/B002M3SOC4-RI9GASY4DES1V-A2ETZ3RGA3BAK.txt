Title: Itouch upgrade
Content:
Bought this new generation 32G to upgrade from the 1st generation 16G to get more space and some new features.  So far I'm very pleased with the performance, some of the bigger games seem to run better and it's nice to have more room.  It's nice to have the built in speaker and external volume controls. The built in bluetooth works great, was easy to link to the headphones and you don't have to deal with the plugin transmitter.

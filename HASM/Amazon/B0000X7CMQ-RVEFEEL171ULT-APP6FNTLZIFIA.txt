Title: Great thermos coffee brewer
Content:
I bought this after being at a freinds house where they had a Starbucks Thermos style coffee maker. After not seeing one of them at a Starbucks, I came to my favorite Shopping place-Amazon.  the reviews for this machine are very good, so I bought one. They do take and recommend #4 filters. Some comments, said water temp was a problem, so I set up the coffee the evening before, so the water comes to room tempreture, which I don't really think is an issue, but it sure makes life easier waking to a fresh pot of coffee. And we just love this machine. easy to clean,easy to use and it makes great coffee and so far, keeps the coffee HOT at least for 3 hours. We used to have Brauns, but this is terrific and highly recommend it.

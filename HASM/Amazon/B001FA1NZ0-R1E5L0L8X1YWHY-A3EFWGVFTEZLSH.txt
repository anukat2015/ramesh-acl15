Title: Not perfect but very nice
Content:
I actually do own the product...purchased at an Apple store over the weekend.
 
Likes: Size (tiny); capacity (4 gigs is great for something this small and is more than enough); the clip (very good for running, spinning, working out); volume/playlist control button (works fine for me); multiple playlists (spinning, running, reading, whatever...and the selection process works fine for me after just a little practice...give it a few days); style (simple and clean).
Dislikes: Headphones work fine but this product begs to be used while moving, and the ear pieces are just regular ear pieces, so Apple has to provide an adapter so you can use this with the headphones that work best for each individual (sport, whatever). 
If the new shuffle came with the adapter, I would give it 5 stars easily. If Apple is late in getting an adapter to market, or makes it expensive or kludgy, would want to revise this review down to just 2 or 3 stars.

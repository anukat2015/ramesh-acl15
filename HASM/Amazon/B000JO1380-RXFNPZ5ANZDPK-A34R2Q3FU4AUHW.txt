Title: Almost flawless.....
Content:
I bought this 160 to replace my 60GB 'pod that I had filled up. The only reason I needed a new one is because I need more space - my old iPod works perfectly.
This new iPod is 99% flawless - it functions perfectly. It also is, oddly enough, FASTER than the HD in my 60GB iPod....newer technology, obviously, and a nice surprise. One would expect a larger HD to be a bit slower than a smaller drive, but not here!
I only have two tiny little complaints. First, and this is most likely a flaw in the newest version of iTunes than the iPod itself, is that some of my artwork does not display. Most of them I can fix, but some I just cannot get to work. Not a huge deal, but a minor flaw in iTunes nonetheless.
The other minor gripe is that on this new iPod, the wheel click-sound is either entirely on or entirely off. This means that when it is connected to my stereo or in my car, you hear the clicker over the full sound system, so while one track is playing and you are searching for another, you hear the clicker sound over your stereo. On my old iPod there were multiple settings to either turn the sound off entirely, hear it only from the iPod or hear it over the speakers/headphones.
I'd like to NOT hear the click sound over the full sound system and only from the iPod.
Again, a minor gripe, but a gripe nonetheless.
The video playback is great and cool to have, and otherwise its just another flawless iPod.
Highly recommend and you cannot beat the price here at Amazon!

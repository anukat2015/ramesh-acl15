Title: Wall mount would be better
Content:
I bought this for a baseboard electric heater because I didn't want to go to the trouble of mounting and wiring a thermostat in the wall.  The first disadvantage is that you have to get down on floor with a flashlight to set and program it.  The second disadvantage is that whatever temperature you set it is not what the room will be because it is mounted on the heater.  When the heater comes on it warms the thermostat much sooner than the room and cuts the heater off.  So to make it work you have to set it much higher than you want the room to be and then come back and reset it after the room has warmed up.

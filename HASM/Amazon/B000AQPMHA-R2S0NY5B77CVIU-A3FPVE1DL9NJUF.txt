Title: exactly what I was looking for
Content:
I am not a big coffee drinker.  I like a cup in the morning and that's about it.  After that I drink tea and the occasional cup of decaf coffee in the evening.  This coffee maker is perfect for that.  It is quick, easy, and requires no clean up.  It doesn't make a super strong cup of coffee but that's OK with me, and Green Mountain coffee has a couple of strong coffees in K-cups that work very well with the coffee maker-Sumatran Reserve and Dark Magic.  I've found Green Mountain to be the best coffee for the Keurig. I don't recommend making tea using the tea k-cups.  Tea needs to steep and doesn't get the chance with this coffee maker so it ends up being very weak-think hot water with almost no flavor to it.  However, I use it to heat water for my tea and that's also quick and easy.  It makes a little noise when filling but it's only for 30 seconds or so.  I don't leave my pot on all day because I don't use it enough to make that worthwhile.  It only takes a couple of minutes for it to be ready to brew after I turn it on.  I'm also glad that I got the model that makes just one size cup-7.25oz.  I don't need all of the other sizes and if I'm going to use a travel mug I'll just use a second k-cup and brew into the same mug.  I'm glad I didn't waste the extra money on the fancier models.  This model is perfect.

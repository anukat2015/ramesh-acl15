Title: Quieter than expected
Content:
I enjoy using the machine in general. Light, quiet, easy to control and use and the washable filter. Could have been better if a few things had been designed better: (1) the lid to tools compartment often get caught with the handle, (2) the metal handle does not often locked 90 degrees to the head, (3) the lid to the dust cup is not easy to remove and (4) the cup is too dark to see if it is really full (perhaps you don't want to see!). Solid value.

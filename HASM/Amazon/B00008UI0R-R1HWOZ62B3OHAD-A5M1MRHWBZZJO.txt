Title: Well made, works well, fairly easy to use, and light to carry
Content:
We just got one the other day, so i don't know about long term reliability. But on first use it was powerful, and versatile. It takes some assembly and figuring out how to attach everything, but its really not as cumbersome as it looks. 
Pros: You can turn the vacuum on and off with a button on the handle. 
You can carry the canister easily up stairs with the handle. 
It has multiple levels of suction. 
It is powerful, pulls up alot of dirt from carpets. 
Retractable cord is nice. 
Is lightweight and fairly easy to manuever. 
Cons:The carpet head doesnt twist, so you have to twist your wrist when using. 
Wish you could just turn off the brushes for use on hard floors, instead of having to switch heads.

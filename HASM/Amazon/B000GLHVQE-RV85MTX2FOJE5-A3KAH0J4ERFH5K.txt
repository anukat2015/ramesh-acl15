Title: I'm shocked at how good this is.
Content:
My heater arrived today.  I plugged it in, turned it on, and noticed how quiet it was.  I could hear the fan, but I found it soothing rather than distracting.  While the fire doesn't look completely realistic, it's real enough to provide ambience.  I only have one real complaint, and that is I wish it came with its own thermostat.  My master bedroom heated up very quickly, and it's a rather large room in a new construction apartment. Since I spend a lot of time in my bedroom and hate turning on the central heating to warm a whole apartment, I expect that this will get a lot of use. This model does not have a door in the front that can open, but I don't mind. I checked the sides, back and top after leaving the heater on for a few hours, and they did not warm up appreciably.  I would have rated this unit 4 stars, but I haven't owned it long enough to say how good the components are and whether they will last.

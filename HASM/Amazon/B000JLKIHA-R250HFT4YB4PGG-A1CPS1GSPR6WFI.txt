Title: Why does Apple send you a white headphone for a black IPOD
Content:
Please enlighten me. 
I recently bought an Black IPOD and received one with a white earpiece and white charger. I called Apple to return it and get a White IPOD but they want to charge me a 10% restocking fee. Wish I had bought it from Amazon instead. Do not buy from the Apple store, they will charge you a restocking fee if return it for any reason.

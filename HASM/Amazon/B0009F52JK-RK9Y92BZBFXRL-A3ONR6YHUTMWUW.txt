Title: Good percolator with crummy plastic top
Content:
For the money, this percolator could at least have a top (clear spout) that isn't made out of plastic.  I paid $60 for this percolator and within 9 months the clear, plastic spout was broken (disintegrated from the heat).  I don't leave the percolator on longer than 30 minutes.  The part from West Bend is $1.99 with shipping of $7.99 plus tax.  Why does it cost $7.99 to ship such a small part?  I am disappointed with the quality of this West Bend item.

Title: Worst cool...it actually heats up the room.....
Content:
We just bought this yesterday, and it was 98 degree in san jose,ca. Our room was very small, so I thought maybe a swamp cooler will help, but NO, it made the room even hotter. ( I know it's not a AC, but a normal fan is better than this piece of ****..) I can't tell any difference between the "cool" mode and the "fan" mode. We bought it from Fry's, and they don't let us return it and they price it at $189.

Title: This thing is awesome!
Content:
I received this product for Christmas. We have about 1500 sq ft of hardwood floors in our house, and with 3 dogs it was impossible to keep the "hair bunnys" up. Now it takes me about 5 mins to sweep the entire house, and I don't kill myself doing it. I was even able to sweep up the debris left by the christmas trees on the carpet. I wouldn't try to do full carpet sweeping, and if you have really thick plush carpeting it might not work, but it's great for spot cleaning. I can't find anything negative to say.

Title: BUG VACUUM
Content:
I RECEIVED THE BUG VACUUM IN A TIMELY BASIS.  IT WORKS FINE AND THE SUCTION IS STRONG.  HOWEVER, I HAVE HAD TO USE SOME OF THE PARTS FROM A PREVIOUS UNIT TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT AND ALSO HAD TO INSERT CYLINDRICAL GLUE TRAP IN THE TUBING TO KILL THE BUGS AND SPIDERS.  WHEN THE TRAP IS FULL THEN I CAN REPLACE IT AND IT IS VERY CLEAN.  I WISH THE MANUFACTURER HAD THOUGHT TO USE THIS METHOD IN THEIR UNIT.  IT IS A LOT EASIER TO DEAL WITH.  OTHER THAN THAT, I AM SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE AND THE UNIT.

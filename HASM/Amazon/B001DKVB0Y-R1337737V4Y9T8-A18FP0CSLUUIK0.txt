Title: Only one complaint
Content:
Water got trapped inside the lid of the pot when I rinsed it off after using it for the first time. I can't tell where the water is but can hear it sloshing around when I shake the lid. I've tried draining it in all sort of positions but the water won't come out. And it can't be disassembled. I'm afraid the water will eventually cause mold. But in the meantime, I'm enjoying the cofee maker and like everything about it--except that lid.

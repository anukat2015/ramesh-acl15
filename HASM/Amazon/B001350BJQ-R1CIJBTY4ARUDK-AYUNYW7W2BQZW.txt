Title: Great Little Player
Content:
First let me say, the customer service for this device is super.  The player works great the only thing I needed was the update for video viewing and received this within 30 minutes and the video was up and playing within the next 30 minutes. Great video quality compatible with those Apple devices...we have 3 of those, so I know what I am talking about.  The music player is great, the FM radio works great, and viewing photos is great.  We have had the player for almost a week and my 8 year old grandson can navigate around the player just fine.  The player is sturdy and is completely touch screen.  I am very pleased with my decision to take a chance with this player.  My 24 year old said she'd want one for her birthday if it was good quality, well guess what she is getting.  She will love it.  dathib

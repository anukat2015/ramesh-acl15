Title: NOT SAFE! Heater Caught on Fire
Content:
I would love to give this product a good review, as it is warm and efficient for heating a room so you don't have to run the heater for the entire house. However, just a couple nights ago, our heater caught on fire in the middle of the night. My wife luckily woke up at 3am to find flames coming out the front of the heater. We are fortunate that my wife woke up and also that the flames were not able to reach anything else, like blankets or clothes, otherwise we might not have much of a house now. Be wary if you buy/use this product!

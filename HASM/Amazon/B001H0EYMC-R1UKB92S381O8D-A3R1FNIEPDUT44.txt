Title: So far it's good
Content:
It's a bit soon to give a final answer about this space heater.  It meets my expectations as far as function. It is attractive and seems to be of quality construction. I don't have an electric bill since I began using it and I don't know if it will last a year.  Those are two important factors that can only be determined with time. Pardon me for withholding a glowing review, but experience has taught me that it's the long haul that matters.

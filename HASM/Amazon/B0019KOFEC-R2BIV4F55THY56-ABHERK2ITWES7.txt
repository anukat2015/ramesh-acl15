Title: Pet lover pet hair attachment
Content:
The vacuum itself is terrific, and I have used Mighty Mites before and like; however, the attachment that is supposed to lift all pet hair, jams
easily and does not rotate as it is supposed to without stopping.  Right
now it sits in the closet because I can't be bothered with the hassle of taking it apart to unjam it.

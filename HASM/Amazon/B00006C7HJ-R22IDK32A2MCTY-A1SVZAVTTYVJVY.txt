Title: 1300 gsx
Content:
I bought a black vornado vh2 in dec 2001 and have used it in my bedroom every winter at night .  the  thermostsat goes to 55 deg on my home furnace at bed time. only problem i have had was the thermostat sticking on the vh2. they use a crude bimetal thermostat on my unit. I took it apart one time and repaired it. it's worked fine since.
 it's been a great unit and I would purchase another but after reading reviews I thought maybe they cheapened them up. 
I had 2 pelonis original ceramic disc heaters previously and this unit has been far more trouble free and cheaper (initially) for me.....

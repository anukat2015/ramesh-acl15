Title: Great coffee, but a little slow
Content:
Got this to replace my Bunn with the pre-heated water chamber for instant brewing (which after a while seemed to lose all its water in a couple of days). 
This machine so far makes very good coffee, and is intuitive to use. As others have said, it's on the slower side (about 15 minutes to completely brew the 14 cups) but if the result is better tasting coffee, so be it. The gold filter is also a nice inclusion and hopefully will stand the test of time cleaning wise. 
The cord, however, is an absolute joke. As long as you don't need this machine to be more than a hamster's length away from the wall plug, you'll be fine. Otherwise...get an extension. As I said, however...the coffee tastes great so these are mostly nitpicky things you could probably find of a different sort on any machine you'd buy.
Last but not least...I've seen a lot of people commenting on how nice the water level gauge on the side of the machine is. Why? This "feature" seems totally ridiculous to me. If you fill up the carafe and pour it in...guess what. You have one carafe full (14 cups) of water in there. Re-verifying that on the side of the machine seems kinda...a waste of time. lol  (I suppose if you use a different pitcher to pour in water then it'd be handy, but the manual *specifically* states to only use the carafe to pour in water...any other pitcher will void the warranty.  No...I kid! ;-) )

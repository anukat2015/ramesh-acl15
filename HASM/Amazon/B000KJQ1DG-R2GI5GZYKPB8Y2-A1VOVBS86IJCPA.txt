Title: An Amazing product from an amazing company!
Content:
I am also a newbie in the dSLR world.  I contemplated for many months before i decided to commit to a particular camera, primarily between the cannon rebel xti, the sony alpha, the pentax k10d, and this little gem.  I ultimately decided on the nikon d40 primarily because:
a.  The price
b.  I had no old lenses, so compatibility was not an issue
c.  The Nikon quality
For those who are crying that old lenses are not compatible with this camera, i think it is a moot point, because the consumer this camera is aimed at most likely has not old lenses and is looking to start buying them.  If you are already a Nikon user, then this camera is likely not suitable for you, and probably be more happy with the Nikon d80.  
Anyways, as a new Nikon owner and user, I AM Thrilled to be the owner of this camera and am looking foward to many great years taking pictures with it.

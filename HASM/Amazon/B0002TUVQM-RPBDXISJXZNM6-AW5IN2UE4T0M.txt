Title: Its not just Hot Cocoa...
Content:
This Christmas my mom sent this to our family. Like with a lot of gifts we get each year, I was happy mom was sending gives but hated the idea she was wasting money on something like this. You take it out of the box and the first thing that comes to mind is playsckool all over again and the easy bake ovens. But I was quite surprised at what came out. It makes a really good hot cocoa and chai tea. My only concern is that it is another appliance on the counter. We have so many right now and to have this one there too, almost becomes too much. If your single or a small family, it fine. But for what it does, its not all that. You could heat up milk in the microwave and get the same effect. Hope that helps someone. I wouldn't buy it, but for the price, its a nice gift for someone that likes a hot cocoa once in awhile.

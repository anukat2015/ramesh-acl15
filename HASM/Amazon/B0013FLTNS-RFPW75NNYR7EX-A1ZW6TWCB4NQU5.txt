Title: Switching from a PC is worth it
Content:
As a longtime PC user I was hesitant to make the switch. After 6 months with this machine, I'm glad I did.  It's stable, fast, and everything just works.  I thought it would take a long time for me to get used to the "mac way of doing things" but it really just took about a week. Now I'm hooked.

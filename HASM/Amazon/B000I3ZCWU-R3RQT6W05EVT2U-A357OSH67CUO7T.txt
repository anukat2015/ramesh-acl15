Title: Canon Rebel XTi Digital 10 MP
Content:
I do commercial work for hotel advertising.  Already own a Rebel 8MP, but having two bodies eliminates changing lenses so often.  Why the Canon?  Least digital noise in higher ISO settings, durable body, very user-friendly settings.
This XTi has a quick change on point of focus and a larger LCD viewer which I like.  In the nearly 3 yrs of using my first Rebel, I haven't found much about these cameras I don't like.  The one thing I miss, that I had with my G series Canon point & shoot, is a preview of my shots in a tip-out LCD viewer.
That being said - it's a great camera for the money.  -  Ed Plimpton, Xact Image Photography

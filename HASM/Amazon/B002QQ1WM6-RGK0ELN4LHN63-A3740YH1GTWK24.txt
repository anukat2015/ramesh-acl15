Title: love this computer
Content:
Bought this for $599.00 at BB and just love it. This is my first lap top.  I found it to be Quick like lightening - and great memory with the DDR3, 4g memory, dual processors, and 5g hard drive. 64 bit Windows 7 is great except fire fox doesn't seem to do well on it. The screen is large, brilliant and easy to look at.  Battery life is about 3.5 hours - a little less than the specs.   
A video on the webcam turned out great - sent it to my brother in California and he loved it. Put on a couple professional programs that use a great deal of memory and the computer didn't even notice. No problems with many simultaneous programs running.  Please note:  I am not a gamer!  
Only negative: Key pad is difficult to use - I will go wireless mouse asap. DDR3 memory with 4g is NOT expandable.
I took the lap top out on the patio, to the garage, and all through the house and the signal was great.  All in all, for the money, I don't think you can do better.  This seems to have it all.

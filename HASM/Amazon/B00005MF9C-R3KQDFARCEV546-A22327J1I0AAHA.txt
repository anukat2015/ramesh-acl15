Title: Does what it's supposed to do and does it well
Content:
I bought this coffee maker about 3 months ago.  So far I've had zero problems with it.  Its basic straightforward design allows this coffee maker to do what it's supposed to do, without fuss or hassle. You fill it up and hit the button. That's it.  It's pretty quick too and perfect for students who need their coffee fix but don't want to waste coffee (like when you use a regular coffee machine that makes 6-10 cups at a time).  
The only gripe I have is with the free 'Travel Mug' that came with the machine.  After a few weeks the inner rubber lining came loose from the outer shell (due to what looks to be shoddy manufacturing).  I'm still using the mug (the cup stays together most of the time), but I sure won't be traveling with it ;)  It's not a big deal because I regularly use other size/shape cups and they all work fine.
For the price, this coffeemaker is a pretty sweet deal.

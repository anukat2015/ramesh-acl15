Title: Heats via lightbulb
Content:
Don't confuse this heater with a regular coil heater. This one produces it's heat from a halogen bulb. Therefore, you get a lot of heat for 400/800 watts. It's a nice gentle heat. There is no temperature setting, but there is a timer.
Note, that since it uses a lightbulb, it produces light. At 800 watts, you get quite a bit of light reflecting off the dish. This might be fine for lighting a room but not for sleeping.

Title: Best Laptop!
Content:
I had to review this product after reading the other review.  I have not had encounters with Gateway customer support, but the laptop itself it great.  Just be careful where you buy it from.  I purchased mine from Bestbuy and had the opportunity to return it for any reason within 2 weeks.  I highly recommend this laptop for anyone that plays games or just wants to use it for basic computing.  
I purchased this laptop about a month ago.  My husband and I had looked around for a year or so before making our purchase.  When we saw this particular one, we were suprised at the price.  We paid $749 for it, and could not be happier.  You cannot get another laptop that even slightly compares to the spec's this one has in its price range.  It has run everything at exeptionally high frame rates.  
The battery life is not wonderful, but we have the cable and an adapter for our vehicle.  So that problem does not concern us.  It also gets a little hot, but I've not run across a laptop that doesn't.  Just make sure you have a cooling pad to prevent your lap from burning.

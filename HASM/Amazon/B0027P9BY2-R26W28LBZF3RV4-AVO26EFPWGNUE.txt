Title: Awesome!!!!
Content:
A couple of months ago I decided to upgrade from my toshiba satellite laptop. I was going to buy another toshiba until I came across this during my research and decided this laptop was the best bang for my buck.  What do I like about it? Everything!! I love the large memory and the 320g hard drive is double of my toshiba.  I don't regret jumping from toshiba brand to sony.  The built in webcam and microphone are great.  They work perfectly with aim, yahoo, and skype.  I was easily able connect to my wireless router without reinstalling the software.  The only downside is the battery.  I will be ordering a large capacity battery soon.  I can't wait hook up my sony hd camcorder and start editing my home videos.  I would definitely recommend this laptop to friends.

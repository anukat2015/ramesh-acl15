Title: Very Disappointed
Content:
My first one quit working after three days.  It wouldn't turn on, it wouldn't charge, my computer wouldn't even detect it when it was plugged in.  I tried everything they said and it remained a little, shiny rectangle of nothingness.  The second one seemed to work better from the beginning and it actually still works, but it shuffles up my album covers or loses them altogether.  Battery life isn't great either.

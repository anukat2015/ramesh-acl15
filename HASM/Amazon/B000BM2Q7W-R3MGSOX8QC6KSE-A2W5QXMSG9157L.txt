Title: Zen Micro Photo .........very complicated device
Content:
Super speedy delivery from Amazon.com as always. However this MP3 player is unbelievably complicated.........navigating through the player itself is fairly straightforward but trying to organize, delete or move files around from your computer is an exercise in frustration. In fact it's so complicated that tech support were not able to provide me with really pretty base information on deleting files while the device is plugged into the computer! I have experience with database design using programs like Access; this little product is more complicated. I'm sure there are solutions to the problems I'm experiencing but the question is how much time should you have to spend learning new software and organizing data in order to get the most out of your MP3 player?

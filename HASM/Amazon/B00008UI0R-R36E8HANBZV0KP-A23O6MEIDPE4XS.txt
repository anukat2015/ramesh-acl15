Title: So far so good
Content:
After three weeks or so of vacuuming new shag carpet, I am quite satisfied with this vacuum.  On high it has a good bit more suction than my 20 year old Kenmore.  Not sure if the lighter weight means it won't be as durable, but time will tell.  Definately easier to use on stairways.
Pros:  Variable speed suction, lots of power on high, light weight.  The little suction driven power head for use on stairs is nifty, but power driven would have been better (and, I'm sure, more expensive).
Cons:  Cannot store all of the attachments on the canister.  Speed button could be located in a better spot as it can get pushed accidently.  The canister that traps the dirt could be a bit bigger, but that may not be an issue after I've vacuumed the new carpets a few more times.  Wow, never new how much fiber and dust comes out of a new shag carpet.....

Title: the best ipod thats is a 4 gb
Content:
I would like to share to you about this ipod. It can hold up to 1000 songs and each song you buy on itunes for 99 cents. It is called an ipod nano (FYI). I love to listen to my ipod everyday. All of my friends try to listen to it. And my favorit song is SweetHome Alabama and i know it by heart. I love the ipod nano 4 gb it is the coolest ever. They have alredy down loaded 4 games when you by it. I like when you get on itunes and buy alot of songs like Fergiluos it is so funny! And I also like the song londan briges By fergie i like her songs. I think you can make alot of high scores on the music quiz(on games). I would really recomend this ipod to alot of people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

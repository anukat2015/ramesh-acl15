Title: Nice Camera!
Content:
This is my first time writing the review. I don't want to go in length about the camera since I am also a novice user of DSLR Cameras. I did my research for Nikon and Canon using multiple websites and walking into local stores. Canon felt the most comfortable in my hands. I loved the quietness of it as well in a continuous shooting mode as well as how quick it is in a  single shot mode when taking really quick multiple shots. Picture quality is definitely exceptional and is most noticeable when picture is enlarged. It helps in editing when you can zoom in and crop to a subset of the main picture and still maintain a good quality picture with the subset picture enlarged. I didn't feel much difference in picture quality in small prints such as 4x6 but ability to shoot in various preset modes such as landscape and portrait and able to manually configure f-stop, aperture priority, shutter priority beats shooting with a pocket digital camera any day. On my trip to Las Vegas, I was able to make adjustments and take really good shot of fountains at Bellagio during day, sunset and night. I carried my pocket camera and shot with it as well but couldn't adjust much during difficult lighting situations. What I also love is the ability to zoom in and it's still pretty good with a 18-55mm lens. I was able to zoom in on the fountains as they were consistently changing during the choreography and take quick pictures. The pictures came out really good. I definitely would buy this camera again especially at the price it was listed, below $740. It is still an expensive camera but still the best camera you can find for that price and worth it if you want quality pictures. Don't forget to get a filter to protect those expensive lenses as well!

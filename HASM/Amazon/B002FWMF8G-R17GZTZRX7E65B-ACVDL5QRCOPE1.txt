Title: Love Love Love this Frappe Maker!
Content:
I am addicted to D&D's Coffee Coolata's, so I was so excited to receive this Frappe Maker. I do agree with some of the other reviews regarding the coffee being a little weak, but you can add different flavors to your Frappe. I bought a bottle of Hazel Nut syrup from Sam's club, and if you add just about two tablespoons of the flavored syrup, with the ice and cream, you will be surprised at how good it is. It tastes just like a Hazel Nut Coffee Coolata. My sister loves this Frappe Maker so much that she purchased one for herself. It will pay for itself in no time. Great product!

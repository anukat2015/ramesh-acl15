Title: Messy
Content:
This unit looks nice, and I liked the idea of a thermal carafe, but I was quickly disappointed. 
1.  The two holes in the back of the unit could easily leak water while filling the unit. I think they are there to keep the user from overfilling the it, but why not just design it so you can't put in twice as much (literally!) water than needed? 
2.  The carafe needs to be pre-heated with hot water for maximum effectiveness? Kind of kills the wake-to-brewed coffee timer... This isn't a big deal, as my wife and I typically drink the coffee within two hours of brewing, but still, it's an inconvenience. (Note to Mr Coffee- make the base of the carafe solid so it transfers heat and install the usual warming plate...)
3.  The final straw was when I opened the lid to dump the coffee grounds- all the condensation on the underside of the lid ran down and dripped all over the counter behind the coffee maker. This is a REALLY poor design that could be easily remedied by having that condensate flow back into the freshwater tank with something as simple as a small plastic tab on the bottom of the lid that overlaps the back of the tank.
Things that are due to reliability and poor manufacturing quailty are bad enough, but when you start with poor design, it will never be a good product, let alone great. We are returning this unit after one use.

Title: Wonderful product!
Content:
I bought one of these early in the year & it has been a blessing in my old, drafty, under-insulated house.  I don't need to crank up the expensive gas heating, but I stay nice & warm in my family room now.  I am saving up to buy 2 more in smaller sizes for other rooms.  The increase in my electric bill has been slight, but the decrease in my gas bill has been noticeable!
Plus my older cat loves it too!  She just lays right down & goes to sleep!

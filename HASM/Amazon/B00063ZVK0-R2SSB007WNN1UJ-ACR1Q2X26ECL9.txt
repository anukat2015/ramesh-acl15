Title: THE BEST
Content:
This is truly the best space heater I've ever owned, and I've tried them all!  It is ultra lightweight, stays cool to the touch, and keeps toddlers' fingers out of the heating area.  Just program the temperature that you desire, and it meticulously keeps it that way in the room.  It shows you the actual room temperature, the programmed temp., and the setting it's on (low/hi, or just the fan.)  Worth every cent that it costs.  I'd pay double for it, and I'm about to purchase a second one to save on the high gas/heating prices this winter.  I have a new baby on the way, so I can keep my thermostat in the house set low, while I keep the baby's room to a warmer/more comfortable setting with the heater.  LOVE IT!!!

Title: A convenient tool you'll learn to love.
Content:
I had one of these myself and decided to purchase one as a gift for my mother.  Gave it to her at Christmas and she loves it.  Seems to mention it every time I visit.  Its a convenient option to pulling out the "big" vacuum and works in those small spaces where the "big" vacuum doesn't fit. Well worth the low Amazon.com price.

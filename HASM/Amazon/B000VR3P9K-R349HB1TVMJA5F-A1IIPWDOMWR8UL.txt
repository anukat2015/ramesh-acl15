Title: Macbook Pro - Totally awesome
Content:
I got the laptop about a month ago to replace my old Windows notebook and have been amazingly surprised with how little (nothing) I miss about the Windows environment.  I use it at Client sites on Windows networks and have no issues.  I bought VMware Fusion and it is flawless.  I haven't used all the software yet but I love the integrated camera and speakers are surprisingly solid.  The screen is great for movies on the plane.  I also have used the Airline adapter each week for 6 hour plane ride (on American Airlines) and it allows me to work/watch movies as much as I want to.  Has made my Ipod touch pretty useless on the plane since I have unlimited battery.  The airline adapter does NOT charge the battery but does run the laptop and allows it to charge my Itouch without any problem.

Title: Not the class of it's class anymore
Content:
I purchased both a Zune 120 and an Ipod Classic. Except for battery life and more choices to buy on iTunes, the Zune is easily the better mp3 player. As long as you check your settings, the battery life on the Zune is fine anyway. The sreen size is so much better. The navigation on the player is WAY better. It's amazing how iPod reviewers never actually look at the Zune before blindly buying an iPod.

Title: Great product love it.
Content:
Amazon should provide an ability to rate 4.5 .. recently got this unit looks great.... very quite and effective.. we all cuddle up close to it.. 
Ive always hated the fact that inspite of spending a fortune on a top of line central heating for the house.. I still have to shiver for a few minutes before the room temp is right ... but with this baby  we carry it where ever we are.
I also have 1 smaller unit which i got for the bathroom.. but in all honesty this is the one i use the most.. Thermostat with temp readings and time limit control and remote are must features for a well rounded heater..
Feels like winter wont be that bad ever again...!

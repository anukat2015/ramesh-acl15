Title: Great player, needs to be a little more robust.
Content:
I love the player, it has a FM radio which is underrated by Apple that is why I purchased the Zune.  I like the features, such as games, pictures and customized desktop.  Only problem I had was the back button stopped working after two weeks.  I contacted customer service and they turned it around in 8 days.  I think that helped to renew my confidence in the device.  I just wish if Microsoft has known problems with this device it would be easier to troubleshoot.

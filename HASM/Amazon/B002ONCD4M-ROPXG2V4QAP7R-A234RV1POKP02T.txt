Title: Great laptop for a great price.
Content:
We got this laptop for my son's birthday.  Mostly picked this one because of the specs on it and after doing research the HP laptops seemed to be rated pretty good especially the Dv series.
Although I haven't used it myself, my son just loves it.  He uses it for school work, internet and dvd's and tells me it's fast as "H", lol.  He can do plenty of things at the same time.  He says he can play games pretty good, he's not a big "online" gamer through his laptop he usually plays XBOX360 life through his xbox and tv, but he plays just regular downloaded computer games (cd or online).  Graphics are fine and speed is great.  Overall his experience with his laptop was my cue to buy the 1360US which I reviewed also, however only on customer service of HP which may not be a totally fair review, but HP really need to work on their customer service.  But then I've had other brands (gateway, Sony, Compaq and customer service stinks no matter what brand you have it seems).
Overall assessment:
Pros:
-Pretty (the eye needs something too, lol)
-Fast
-Great battery life (but because it's a 12 cell it's really chunky)
-Will appeal to a lot of people with different needs
-Price
Cons:
-Little bulky
-Battery is huge (inconvenient for hauling it around)
-Shiny surface (hard to keep clean)
-Power inlet (why oh why do so many manufacturers put it on the right side with a straight (instead of bend) plug).  In my opinion it would be more convenient on the left side or the back.

Title: Definately a needed add on..
Content:
If you are buying the Mr. Buddy Heater, this hose (or the 5' model) are definately needed. By using the larger (20lb or bigger) tanks you have many more hours of operation without having to change the disposable tanks. This hose will also allow you to use bulk tanks with any propane appliance that accepts the disposable tanks (stoves, lantern, etc.).

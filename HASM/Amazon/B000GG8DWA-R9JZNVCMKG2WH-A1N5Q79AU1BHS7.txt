Title: Love this little heater!
Content:
We love this little heater, and using it all the time hasn't raised our electric bill noticeably.  
My only complaint is the same that other users have - the labels for the 400 vs. 800 setting should be in the front instead of on the side.  I thought this was a silly thing, but it actually is a bit annoying!

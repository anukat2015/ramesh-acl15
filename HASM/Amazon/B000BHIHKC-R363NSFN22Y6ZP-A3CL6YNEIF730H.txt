Title: Stupid coffee maker
Content:
I bought this maker for my mother a while ago and after a few months it stopped working & now it just makes sounds then 2 buttons start blinking. I can't seem to fix it. I thought she was doing something wrong all this time but now I can see its just a sucky product. I'm really disappointed in Black&Decker. They used to be such a good and reliable company.

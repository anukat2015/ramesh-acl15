Title: 50D delivers as promised!
Content:
Previous camera for 6 years was an early Digital Rebel which I'm still very pleased with. For an upgrade I was debating between the 40D and 50D.  The 50D's new sensor is what swayed me.  I chose the 18-200 kit.  Extremely pleased all around. The image stabilized lens, high ISO capability and low noise sensor does very well in low light conditions - another major consideration as I shoot concerts, night shots and astrophotography. Main complaint so far is pretty minor - on/off switch is poorly placed and not intuitive.

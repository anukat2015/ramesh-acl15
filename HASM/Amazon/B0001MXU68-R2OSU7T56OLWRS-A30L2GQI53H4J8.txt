Title: Love the machine...the melitta coffee is beah!
Content:
This machine is great!  I hated feeling like my automatic drip never gave me the cup of coffee that I could get at a coffee shop or nice resaurant.  The one:one was the answer!  No burnt taste or bitterness at all. The machine much easier and less time consuming than an automatic drip.   I will say that (and I swear I'm not a coffee snob) I agree with other reviewers about the Melitta pods themselves.  Not good coffee...tolerable, but they don't do the machine justice. (...) You won't be sorry and you'll get to best cup of joe from your one:one.

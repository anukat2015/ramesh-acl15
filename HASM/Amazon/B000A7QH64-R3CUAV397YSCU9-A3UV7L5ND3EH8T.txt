Title: Phenomenal!
Content:
We used to have a hand-held vac that picked up NOTHING. In disgust, we threw it away and went without one for years. Any time there was a mess downstairs, we lugged the heavy-duty vaccuum cleaner downstairs--even for minor debris.
My 7 year old son is having a love affair with popcorn, so it tends to get *everywhere* these days. "That's it!", I said. "We're buying a hand-held vac."
So we went to Target and the Shark Cordless Vac seemed the most promising. It was heavy and boasted a higher voltage than the rest: 15.6.  We decided to buy it, and it works WONDERFULLY!
The Shark Cordless Hand Vac includes a charging stand, one crevice tool, and one cleaning brush. It also features an easily detachable HEPA filter that you can dump into the trash. The brush attachment works great for picking up animal hairs (we have two cats) but the regular vac has such powerful suction, you'll likely pick up hairs just from that! The narrow crevice tool comes in handy when vaccuuming around furniture edges or in hard-to-reach areas.
This Vac is VERY powerful and does the job quite admirably! I'm thrilled with the purchase. 
My son loves to help clean, but this Vac is so heavy, that he often has trouble after awhile. So if you have back trouble, you may want to consider the weight before making the purchase.

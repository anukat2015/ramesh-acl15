Title: love my zune!
Content:
I first had a 4GB ipod nano (2nd generation) and I really loved it. It was great just for listening to music. My fiance decided to get a zune, and once he got it I was jealous :) it was alot cooler than my ipod, it could play videos, and had better games. I found a zune that was 8gb for the same price I had paid for my ipod. The zune is definietly better than the ipod, and even the zune software is pretty cool. It works with WMP, which I liked better than iTunes. The ONLY thing that I miss about my ipod was the ability to search for a song. With zune I cant search but because it is a touch pad it is quicker. Overall, I love it.

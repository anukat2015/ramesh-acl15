Title: Great Laptop, very powerful, but PC might still be better for you!
Content:
Hi everyone,
Yesterday I purchased the brand new Macbook.  This is my first Mac and have been using Windows products for over 15 years.  I have not had any major issues with Windows, but I needed a change because of some issues I was having with my Sony Vaio.  The Vaio had Vista on it so it was a memory vampire but I figured when I upgraded its memory, I thought it would fix the issue.  I still had problems with running my photoediting programs and internet.  I knew I needed a switch and after looking at all the things I need a laptop for (word documents, music creation, photography, etc.).  
Do I think everyone needs to chuck their Windows computers out the Window (see my joke, I am a funny guy) to go and purchase a $1000 laptop? Definitely not!!!!  Do I think that if you use the laptop for the same things as me that you should consider purchasing one?  Yes!  I do love the quick speed with my Photoshop Elements and Garageband is amazing because I don't need to go and shell out lots of money for recording equipment,
With this ongoing battle between Mac and Windows users, I say forget who makes one and look at what your going to truly being using the computer for and make your decisions from there.
Hope this helps!

Title: Over all good machine
Content:
After much searching I landed on this as my mp3 player. I have a couple of other options for listening to mp3's while mobile but they all have complications. I like this one. It has an easy menu to navigate, it has a screen big enough and bright enough to read, it is drop and drag loading, it isn't proprietary to one computer or another.  
Easy to use, compact, good sound, what else do you need? More space? Well I find that 16gb is more than enough for me. That is a lot of music and spanish lessons.

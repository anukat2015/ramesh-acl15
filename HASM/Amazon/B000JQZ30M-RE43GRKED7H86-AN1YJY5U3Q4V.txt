Title: Gool looker, but comes up short
Content:
This little thing puts out a lot of heat for it's small size, but it's missing some features that are important to me. Those are:
1. As with most small heaters, there is only one fan speed, and it's too noisy for my taste. I found the constant sound of air blowing irritating - sounds like a car defroster. 
2. The thermostat only works on the high heat setting. Even though the unit only has one fan speed, it does have 2 heat settings: High and Low.
I give Lasko credit for making a space heater that doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. If it just had a quieter fan, and if the thermostat worked on all settings, they would have a winner.

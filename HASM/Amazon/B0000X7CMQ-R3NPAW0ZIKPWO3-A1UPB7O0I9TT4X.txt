Title: It works just fine
Content:
Got it a few months ago.  It doesn't leak, it brews hot coffee, and it keeps it hot and fresh for hours.  It replaced and ancient Mr. Coffee that had a hotplate heating element.  What an improvement!
  The number 4 filters I bought at Food Lion fit perfectly - I don't know why other people are having trouble with #4 filters (?).  Perhaps different brands of filters are cut slightly differently.  
  As far as leaks go, you must use the screw-on carafe lid when brewing, or the little valve underneath the coffee grounds will not open and you might overflow the machine (this happened to me once - I learned my lesson)!  Also, align the dot on the carafe spout with the dot on the lid (otherwise it *will* leak).    So far, I'm very pleased.

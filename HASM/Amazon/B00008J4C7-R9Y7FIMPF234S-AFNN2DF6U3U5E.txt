Title: Worked great for the first year...
Content:
I had a Shark roadster Vacuum and it worked great for the first year of owning it.  This fall, it was just about 1 year to the exact date of purchase, my Shark Roadster quit working.  I am now left with a vacuum that won't even turn on.  The only thing I can do is throw it away and buy new because it was purchased from Target more than 90 days ago and I no longer have the receipt.  From my experience, the Shark Roadster is not dependable. I hope your experience is better...

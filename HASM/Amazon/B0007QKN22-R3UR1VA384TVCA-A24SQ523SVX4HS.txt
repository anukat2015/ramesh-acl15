Title: Rebel XT - excellent value
Content:
My Rebel XT was stolen in December, and I've upgraded to the Canon 5D.  But I purchased another XT to replace my wife's camera, which was a Canon 570.  For the difference in price (about $200) the XT is vastly superior, and my wife is delighted with its performance and picture quality.  Canon has reduced the construction quality somewhat - more plastic - but for the price, this is a great machine.  I paid Can $ 1100 for my XT body in May of 2005, and now you can buy it with 18-55 lens for $450!  Great value.  Buying it from Amazon was really easy.  It came in days.

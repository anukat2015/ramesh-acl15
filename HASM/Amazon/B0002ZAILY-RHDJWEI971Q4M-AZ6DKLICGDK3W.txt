Title: Ka-Put!
Content:
I got this two Christmas's ago.  Even though iTunes can be temperamental I loved having this! I primarily used it when I went to work out.  One day, I'm at the gym and I turned it off for a couple minutes to talk to someone.  I go to turn it back on and two lights just flash back and forth.  Then iTunes doesn't even recognize it! It says it needs to be restored.  So I clicked "restore" and then it says it's unable to restore due to an "unknown error."  I look into sending it to Apple to get it fixed but it would cost as much to buy a new one as it would to get it fixed!  I just couldn't believe it was go kaput just like that.  Not to mention Apple's has the worst navigation on it's website.. you have to click through seven pages just to get a simple question answered!

Title: What's with the obnoxious beep???
Content:
Okay I bought this coffee maker for two reasons: First I liked the fact that there was no burner that stayed on for hours adding to my power bill and Second my Mr. Coffee coffee maker makes and annoying beep (5 times) when the coffee is done brewing.  
So I get my get my new brewer last week, load it up with water and push the "on" button.  It starts to brew immediately and is very fast at pushing the water through.  As it comes to the end of the cycle it just sits there nice and quiet.. this is great I can brew with relative silence when the family is still asleep.. then "BEEP...BEEP...BEEP...BEEP...BEEP" the noise was almost to loud to stand next to.  I don't remember reading anything about this.  I don't need to have this audible reminder to come and get my coffee.. I am already waiting with cup in hand for that last drop to fall. 
So I did find a way to make the beeper a little quieter but I think I voided any warranty that might have come with it.  Overall the brewer make very tasty coffee and the carafe keeps the leftovers hot all day long.  Hey Cuisinart... how about a warning next time to insert earplugs at a certain point in the brewing process or better yet.. get rid of the beeper!!!

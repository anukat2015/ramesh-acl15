Title: The Lid is Torture!
Content:
I had this coffee maker for over a year and the lid was ALWAYS too difficult to untwist with your bare hands. I always had to use a towel or the rubber pad used to open cans. Many times I gave up and had to had my husband open it for me. The worst of it is, that is how it pours - you have to twist it to get your coffee out - no easy button to open the spout. We kept is so long because the coffee stays hot and delicious. However, life is just too short to keep an appliance that DAILY causes you strife. I wish I had returned it as it is quite pricey.

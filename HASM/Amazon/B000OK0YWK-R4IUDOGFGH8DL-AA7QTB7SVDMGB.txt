Title: One of the best items I have ever recieved
Content:
Over this past holiday season I was lucky enough to recieve a new 30GB Zune. I must say for the week and a half I have had it it has not let me down at all. It was one of the most amazing items I have to this day. The screen shows clear images and movies. It plays all of my favorite movies and clips. Getting the music, videos, and pictures on the device was very easy; the software almost did it for you. The Zune is very easy to use as well. I love my new Zune and I have run in to no problems at all. Infact my cousin is having more problems with her Ipod. Which at first I believed to be a better product until I was able to compare them through use. If I had a choice whether to get the Zune or Ipod by far I would chose the Zune.

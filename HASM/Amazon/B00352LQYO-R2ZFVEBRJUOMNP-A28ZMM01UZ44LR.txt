Title: Great speed but buggy...
Content:
It's a really fast and well designed computer, but within a week the bugs appeared.  I'm left handed and Microsoft used to have left hand/right hand buttons.  In their infinite stupidity they came up with a single button for switching mouse sides.  After switching the finger pad would react with a menu every time you touched it.  Called ASUS, who by the way does NOT give you their phone # in the packaging and the one on their website is on your dime.  I got an 888 off the Microsoft website.  For those of you needing help I wish you luck.  I spent two hours with two different techs who kept putting me on hold (to read the manual).  They had not clue one.  I downloaded a driver and the tech didn't recognize the text that appeared as the driver signature.  It was a nightmare.  Then after a few days the machine suddenly and inexplicably started "tink"ing after every mouse click.  Nothing had been changed, no programs downloaded.  I managed to turn off a few sounds in Sounds and got the problem mostly under control.
I think it best not to buy this computer.  It may just be a lemon, but I went through hell with an HP (NEVER BUY ONE) and vowed to get something truly efficient and reliable this time.  This computer is not it.  I'm looking hard at Acer as it has a good reputation for toughness and long life.  Sony too, but they're a bit pricey for what you get.

Title: Got up the pet hair!
Content:
My last Electrolux finally died after 13 years, so read all the consumer report issues and selected this model about 2 months ago.
Strengths:
Excellent at removing pet hair from carpets - could not be more pleased with the performance on carpets and pet fur (2 cats + a golden retriever/collie mix = lots of fur!)
Cord and hose lengths are longer than my old one - not sure why other reviewers complained; seem just as long as my Mom's Hoover cord.
Nice compact size - much easier to fit in the closet and carry up stairs than old model
Price is less than my old model too
Areas needing improvement:
Bag is small, might not be a problem if you don't have pets
Bag can be annoying to remove - there is a plastic slide toggle that tends to not move out of the way enuf to allow the bag to slide off easily
For some reason, they designed the power head/tube assembly to swivel in one direction.  Don't know why, as this makes it awkward to manuever, and it only twists to the right - would rather it remain straight, or, turn in both directions.
My husband complains that the regular head doesn't work on hard floors.  I find it works OK (tho not as good as old model).  If you use the hard floors attachement it is fine - we have been used to doing all the floors without having to change heads and so have to make a 2nd trip to the closet for the attachement.
Overall, I'd recommend this - would buy again.

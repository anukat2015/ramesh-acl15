Title: No service from Hoover. World's Worst Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
This vacuum cleaner is the worst vac I have ever had and service from Hoover is seemingly nonexistent as the phone lines are not staffed by real people and no one responds to email when I click on Contact.  I ordered a new filter almost a month ago hoping that would help but the filter never arrived nor do I know if they even shipped it.  All I got was a charge on my credit card which is also all I got from the vac purchase.
The vacuum is extraordinarily cumbersome and the flasher indicating dirty filter has been been flashing since near new and no amount of following cleaning directions ever works to stop the flashing and get full suction; nor is there obstruction in the tubing.  
It it is a cute little thing but clearly all FLASH (pun intented) and no substance.

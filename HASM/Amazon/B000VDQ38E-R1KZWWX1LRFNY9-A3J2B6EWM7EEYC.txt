Title: NO LONGER IMPRESSED
Content:
We purchased this item and like many were completely head over heels about it. We have four cats and it removed the pet hair like nothing we could imagine.  6 months later, it's a complete disaster. The belt constantly breaks, but worse, it gets clogged every time we use it.  The suction is practically zero. We'll be looking for another pet hair eraser this week.

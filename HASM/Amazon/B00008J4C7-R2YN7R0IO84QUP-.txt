Title: Pleased in New Orleans
Content:
I just purchased this vacuum and was delightfully pleased. I ran it over just two rooms in my home the first day and was flabbergasted as to the amount of dust it picked up. And as a response to a guest in Boston, have you heard of the warranty? The warranty card came in the box it was purchased in, if the store won't take it back, then send it to the company. Why throw $100 dollars away when the company guarantees it, duh!

Title: This Vacuum WORKS!
Content:
I purchased this vacuum after reading many reviews of all the products available. We are moving into a home with no carpet, hardwood floors only with area rugs. This vacuum is so easy to use and the suction power is superior, so much so, that I had to adjust the power head to compensate. The power head will run away with you at the low setting, all you have to do is set it on medium and then it behaves !
Very easy to empty, I recommend taking it outside to do so.
It is amazing how much dirt this picks up. We have 2 little boys, a dog and a cat so this vacuum gets a workout!

Title: Good camera, Good quality.
Content:
Hi, i just owned this camera, and it is good for me, it is my first DSLR camera ever, and i loved, i will never lost again the fast moment of my kids, with the 3fps that it can take.
It is so well done, you can adjust a tons of options.
the lens that comes with it 18-55mm it is good for short distance, and have IS(image stabilization). but not a big chance to adjust manually the focus.
i did buy also for this camera the Tamron AF 75-300mm f/4.0-5.6 LD for Canon Digital SLR Cameras 
Sold by: Beach Camera, and it is so good for this camera, you can take good pictures with it.
 
Pros.: good quality, fast response,etc.
cons.: weight.
if you are looking for a good camera this is a good option.

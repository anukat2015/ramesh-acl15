Title: Big disappointment
Content:
It had a lot of power and great pickup, but my Shark Roadster worked for less than five minutes before it turned off because the motor overheated. It's a shame because the cleaner has a lot of great features -- attachments, shoulder strap, etc. -- but that does no good if it won't run. Needless to say, I returned it the next day.

Title: Exact replacement
Content:
We had the same model from 11 years ago and it worked tirelessly for almost that whole time - the connection to the beater brushes was fritzing out so I ordered the new model as a replacement. Thus far I am pretty happy with one exception, the latch to the main cover pops open very easyily and requires constant care when moving the vacuum from area to area.

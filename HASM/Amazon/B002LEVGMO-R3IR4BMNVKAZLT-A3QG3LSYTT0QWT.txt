Title: I would buy this again.
Content:
I spent three years looking for something to replace my Presario 2100.
 This computer is what I was looking for; something smaller with the
same size keyboard, able to Hulu, I-tunes, and google.  It does these
better than the Presario.  The downfalls: 1) touchpad is hard to find
right edge to scroll up and down. 2) I use HOME and END a lot and
these are buried with a function key, I am thinking or remapping some
keys but....  3) I use PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN a lot and they are in a
poor location. Lastly is a perception thing: 4) I wish the keys had
some dish to them rather than flat.  Flat keys feel cheap not modern.
Even with these downfalls I still would buy this computer again.

Title: Great DSLR that you can grow with
Content:
I got a great deal from [...] for the D40 Kit (with 18-55mm lens).  I haven't been able to take that many pictures yet...as the weather has been touch and go lately but I have gotten in a few days of pictures both portraits, landscapes and macros (close-ups) and they all look great.  The other reviews as well as reviews from other sites are pretty consistent in saying that this camera is a very good 6MP camera.  Don't be fooled by thinking 10MP cameras take better pictures.  They capture more detail but also have more "noise" in their pictures.  It's not the top of the line in Nikon's DSLR family but I can say with a high certainty that most (90%) of the people out that that want more capability than a point and shoot camera offers that they will love this camera and probably stay with it for years and years to come.  Most point and shoot people do not use the various options/manual adjustments on their cameras because they want the point and shoot capability but those cameras have limits....like zoom...fast shutter....storing the images faster....quality of lens glass...etc.  For a little over double of the price of a point and shoot camera, you could get this kit and have a whole new world of imaging/photography at your finger tips.  For those just getting into photography or you want more than just a P&S camera...this is the best choice out there.
Excellent battery life and great lens quality right out of the box made this an easy choice for my 1st DSLR.

Title: Great Coffee!
Content:
This pot brought all the great coffee flavor I was hoping for, but not until I managed to pry open the lid. There are several metal flanges (?) which grip the inner rim of the pot, keeping the lid safely in place. One of them was incorrectly placed, and I finally managed to fix it after use of pliers and a wrench. That said, wonderful coffee pot, even with relatively inexpensive ground coffee from the supermarket. BTW, pot does make some comforting noise while brewing, but unfortunately, not the same perka-perka-perka of the old guys!

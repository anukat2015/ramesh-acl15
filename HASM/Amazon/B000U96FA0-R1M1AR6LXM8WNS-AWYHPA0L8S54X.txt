Title: Good heater for small-moderate sized room
Content:
This is a good all-around heater, and a huge step up from my old box fan-style heater.  It gives out enough to heat a small room and enough to warm up a moderate sized room.  It is NOT for large rooms with high ceilings unless you are sitting in front of it.  It has kept me warm through the last 4 months, and only seemed a little underpowered on the coldest of nights (15-20 degrees).
Pros:
-Convenient remote that is easy to use
-Oscillation helps spread the heat out
-Thermostat keeps the room from getting too hot
-fairly quiet
Cons:
-display on top is too bright and annoying in a dark room
-lacks a timer to turn ON after 8 hours (I like my room warm in the AM and cooler at night)
-sound may annoy some light sleepers who put it next to the bed

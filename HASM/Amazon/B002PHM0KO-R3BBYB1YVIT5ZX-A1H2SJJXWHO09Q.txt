I'm 41 and have been through every generation of notebook computers, esp. vaio, asus, toshiba, and dell.  This is a great computer, and I can't believe the price. I bought it for my wife who is opening a small business.  She wanted to go mac but I said no way, as the true total cost of ownership for a mac is so much higher than the pc.  Plus, windows 7 levels the playing field.  I've had the beta installed since this past summer and it is fast, stable, runs all apps that I have, and is great for gaming.   So I'll leave it in her own words as to her experience thus far.  Here is the note my wife left me when I came down for coffee this morning in MS word (I went to bed early):
"I am practicing typing lots of words at one time.  This keyboard ROCKS the party! It's so much bigger than my eeepc.  Iam not used to having a keyboard that is so easy to type on.  And the mouse isn't jumping around everywhere which usually drives me CRAZY!!  This raised keyboard is really nice.  The buttons are comfortable to push and very responsive.
I can't believe how big and beautiful the screen is.  I'm not used to it!!  I can actually see more than one quarter of a page. In fact, I can see half the page and I'm sure I could even change the zoom and see more comfortably.
I noticed the mouse pad has a scroll option on the right side. That is nice.  I have never had a computer that was this big!  I think I could get used to it...THANK YOU BRY!!  WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE!!  I LOVE YOU!!"

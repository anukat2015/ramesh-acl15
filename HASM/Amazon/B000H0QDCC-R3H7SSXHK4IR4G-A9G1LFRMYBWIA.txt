Title: Fair to Middling at Best
Content:
For the same price, you get better value from an iPod. Yes, the iPod has a slightly smaller screen. It also is thinner and has a longer lasting battery. When the screen is held up, the size isn't that big of a difference, and it's the same pixel resolution. 
Microsoft is attempting to mimic the iPod ecosystem, but you can't just go out and buy a song for 99 cents. You have to buy it in points, and one point does not equal one penny. At least with the Wii point system, you don't get confused on how much money you've spent. 
Sharing is so slow that there isn't much point. By the time you share a song with someone, you'd be better off just letting them borrow your Zune for three minutes. 
Yeah, yeah. People think the iPod is overpriced and overhyped. I have to say that it really isn't. When you pick up and use an iPod, it screams quality. The Zune just does not.

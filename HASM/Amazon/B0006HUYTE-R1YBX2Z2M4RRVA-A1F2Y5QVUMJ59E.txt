Title: cleaning products
Content:
This vaccum ia GREAT ! I love the fact that it is small and light weight. The suction is as strong as a large canister vaccum and it has an extension pole in the handle. It extends with the push of a button! I am a clean freak and this gets all the corners high in the ceilings and skylights. The extension reaches behind the wall unit and under the couches and baseboards without struggling. The only down side is its loud. I don't mind loud as long as the preformance is good. In this case it's great.

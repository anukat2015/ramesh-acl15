Title: What a relief!
Content:
As a brit in a strange land I wanted a canister cleaner, rather than a bulky, heavy upright. They can be found in stores but only lightweight and not very powerful. But this one is great - love the powered head for carpet cleaning and easy to empty chamber. It works better than the upright I was borrowing previously, also made by hoover, and is easier to manipulate around the house.

Title: Worth every penny
Content:
I have had my BrewStation coffee maker for quite some time, and actually this is my second one.  The first lasted almost a year before the power button quick working.  We contacted Hamilton Beach, they sent us a free postage-paid return label along with a new machine. We did not even have to wait until they rec'd the old one before they would send the new one. Nice!
We have not had any problems with the new machine and we have had it for almost two years.  No leaks, no fumbling with a glass pot, (which can cost more than the coffee makers they came with to replace when they break), no dribbling coffee down the side of your cup to the floor/counter.  
For leak problems described in other reviews, make sure the rubber seal at the bottom of the carafe is intact and securely in place.  It can become dislodged when cleaning.  
I noticed what I thought was mold growing on the hinge of the lid, but it is just hard water deposits.  You can lift the lid and press it back just enough to pop the plastic bar (hinge) out.  Wipe the bar down on both sides with a dish cloth then easily pop it back into place.  Do this during routine cleaning to eliminate the deposits from accummulating.

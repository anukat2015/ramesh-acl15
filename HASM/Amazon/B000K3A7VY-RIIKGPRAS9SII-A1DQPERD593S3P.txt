Title: Best coffee I've had in years!
Content:
I purchased an expensive Cuisinart coffee maker and the coffee tasted awful!  Once I purchased this coffee maker, my coffee tasted like it came from a diner!  I feel that Mr. Coffee is often disrespected, while it makes one of the best cups of coffee!

Title: At this price I expected MUCH more
Content:
The problem with this camera is the pictures! And after all is said and done what else do you really care about? I bought this camera for my wife who is an avid amateur family photographer. She wanted something which would take a great quality photo of the things going on around her. There are plenty of super-portable, feature loaded minis to choose from these days. Any one of them can take a decent snap shot. From there, this camera is a big step up in price and a big step down in portability. The promise is that with all it's quality craftsmanship and high tech features you will get real bang for your buck in picture quality. Sorry folks, it just is not the case. Set to full automatic - where all the bells and whistles should really show their stuff - this camera regularly overexposes ordinary daylight photos. It routinely washes out indoor shots with its own flash. And the auto focus is nothing to brag about. My wife is not a photographer. She is an ordinary person who wanted to have fun taking really good family photos. This camera was a huge let down.

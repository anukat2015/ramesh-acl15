Title: great little pot, hard to find size
Content:
My 85 year old parents who live in Florida had a very hard time finding this size coffee pot. They love to make their morning 2 cups of coffee using the ease of this item. After searching many of the popular stores in their area they were unable to locate this item. I ordered it on Amazon and had it sent directly to them. The only con is that the filament does burn out after about a year.

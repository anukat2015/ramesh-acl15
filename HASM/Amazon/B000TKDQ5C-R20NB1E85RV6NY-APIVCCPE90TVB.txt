Title: Surprisingly amazing!
Content:
I recently purchased this in preparation for winter in NYC. If you haven't noticed the listed dimension of this item, you'll be surprised to find that it's very small. But don't let the size fool you, it packs quite a punch. I put this under my desk while I was studying, but it quickly warmed up the entire room (8x15), and I only had it on the first setting, medium temperature. I do not find the noise a problem at all, but I can see how it might affect someone who prefers complete silence for working, reading, etc. Since I just got it, I am not sure of it's durability, but so far, it's great! Its construction looks and feels solid too.

Title: Almost perfect
Content:
OK, so the high ISO isn't the best... but the portability more than makes up for it. After all, the best camera is the one you have with you, and I'm not likely to be constantly lugging around my DSLR and associated lenses... but I carry this everywhere I go. The GF1 + 20/1.7 is a seriously potent combo. All the other pros and cons the other reviews mention are correct.
Verdict: I like this camera so much my Panasonic GH-1 and Sony A700 are now collecting dust in a corner!
The only thing lacking that will make it perfect: in-body stabilization like the one found in the Olympus EP1/2 or the EPL1.

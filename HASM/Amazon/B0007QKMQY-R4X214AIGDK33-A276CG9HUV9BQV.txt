Title: a NYC Art Director's opinion...
Content:
I've art directed my share of photo shoots in NYC and I'm also writing, designing and photographing my cookbook and this camera is perfect for me. Through my experience, I've seen some amazing photography but had never taken the photo. Now I can. It's the easiest camera to operate. I'm a total novice but the quality of the photography is phenomenal. I can't wait to see the photos when I know what I'm doing.  For the curmudgeons that said it doesn't feel like a traditional camera, you're right. But that's a good thing. It's smaller, lighter, faster, sleeker and takes great pictures. I'm sure tradition cameras will copy the XT's design. You'll find that it's not too small. The XT is like a Mercedes and the Nikon is like a Cadillac. My favorite feature is how easily I was able to take pictures from my powerbook. The photos displayed on my screen almost immediately. Then I could change the aperture, ISO, and take another photo instantly. I don't even know what that stuff means but I was able to see the results and through trial and error take a decent photo. I had  always seen photo grain in digital photography, even from high-end professional cameras, but my photos have almost no grain. It's really hard to believe. Digital photographs have always shown grain.

Title: LOVE my Rebel XT
Content:
I have taken some gorgeous pictures with this camera and I know nothing about photography. However, this camera has sparked an interest in learning more about taking pictures. 
Images are incredibly sharp and clear. I have blown several pictures of my kids and a couple scenic photos up to 8x10's and the quality is superb. I mostly use the automatic setting, but I am starting to learn to use some of the other settings.  
Battery life is excellent. I keep an extra battery charging at all times. You definitely want an extra battery and you can find them cheap. Don't let one of these online camera shops sell you one for $40 or $50. These guys online that advertise selling these cameras for ridiculously low prices are "salesmen". They will pull you in by advertising the camera for some crazy-low price. Then they get you on the phone and convince you that you need all this other over-priced stuff. If you don't buy the extras, they suddenly don't have the camera in stock or it will take 3 weeks to ship. They are good at this.. just a little warning. I ended up paying more for mine at a local camera shop just to avoid these guys.
Sorry for my lack of technical knowledge.. here's the bottom line: This camera takes beautifully sharp photos and is simple to use. I am extremely satisfied with the quality. Take lots of pictures and BACK THEM UP REGULARLY!!

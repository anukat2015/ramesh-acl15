Title: Solid 4 Star Product

I am really enjoying this Mac, which I bought for travel purposes. I wanted something that would manage workflow for photography and be light and durable.
As others have said, the sharp edges are an irritant on the wrists but I imagine I will either eventually develop callouses or accidentally slash my wrists and bleed to death while playing internet poker.
Lack of a compact flash slot is a minor irritant, as SD cards are for gumbies. And considering cheap credit card terminals now bristle with USB ports,the Macbook Pro sort of lacks in that area. But it does a great job doing what I wanted, sort of a netbook on steroids.

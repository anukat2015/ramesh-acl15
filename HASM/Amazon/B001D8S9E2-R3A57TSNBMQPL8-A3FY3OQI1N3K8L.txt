Title: Nice Computer, Horrible Display
Content:
Made the mistake of buying first version of Unibody Macbook. No firewire, no SD Card slot, absolutely horrible display! New ones have been released now which have a better display, firewire and SD Card Slot. Just what I needed, but too late. The horrible display ruins the entire experience. I would rather use my old Sony Vaio, which has a clear, sharp display and is a pleasure to use, except for the fact that it doesn't have OSX for an operating system. Maybe someone will buy it on ebay, I hope.

Title: New purchase - so far, so good
Content:
I don't understand all the horrible reviews but then I have only had this product for a week. So far we have found it gets the massive amt of pet hair from our carpets just fine. (I have 3 long-haired dogs). I don't find it any heavier than any other vac I have had. I like the easy emptying when the canister is full. I will check back after I have had it a few months to see if I feel differently but so far we are very pleased with it.

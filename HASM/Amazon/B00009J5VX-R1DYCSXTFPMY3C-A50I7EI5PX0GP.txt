Title: It's a wonderful little piece of equipment.
Content:
I just got the iPod 10GB and I'm pretty impressed so far.  The unit is tiny, sounds great (better than on my computer) and interfaces suprisingly easily with Windows.  This is also the first Firewire device I've used and I'm impressed with the transfer speed.  The user interface on the player is unique but very intuitive, functional and simple to get used to. It doesn't crash, freeze or otherwise torment the user like some products out there.The only drawbacks include the proprietary battery system which means if the battery starts failing you need to do surgery the thing. Also, I've found the included headphones, as rich and wonderful as they sound, to be very uncomfortable, at least as earbuds go.  I'm currently using my old Sony earbuds instead.  Finally, some additional on-board features such as a voice recorder or FM radio tunner would be nice, but aren't too sorely missed.Definitely a product worth buying.  You won't find a better MP3 player anywhere.

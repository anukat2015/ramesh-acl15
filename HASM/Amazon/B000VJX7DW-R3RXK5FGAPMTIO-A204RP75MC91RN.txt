Title: Art and Science Arm in Arm
Content:
I bought this camera six months ago from Harvey Norman here in Western Austalia along with the 18 - 200 zoom. This is my second DSLR, the first being my Pentax istDS.
It has taken me five of the last six months to get completely familiar with the camera and how to get the best out of it.
The camera is a joy to use and much of the pleasure just comes from the look and feel of the camera.  It is really an engineering marvel and a work of art.  The miracle is that it can be both.  Nikon have engineered a camera marvelous in it's complexity and competence but it is a thing of beauty in it's own right.  The useability of the camera is outstanding with everything where it should be, close to perfect.
The pictures are of course only as good as the photographer can make them but the camera is always ready to do whatever you tell it to and it makes quick work of it.
I bought a Nikon SB-900, the 'King Kong of Flashes' as I call it.  It is very effective though and now I look forward to taking photos inside rather than being apologetic about the flash photos I used to take.  While they weren't terrible they weren't great either.  Direct flash has a way of sucking the life out of a shot. 
The Nikon D300 has got to become a classic although the technology is still progressing albeit, ever more slowly as digital photography nears maturity.
I really don't want to part with this camera, ever... no that sounds petulant and possessive...OK it is what it is. :)

Title: Excellent laptop, more than I expected!
Content:
I really like this laptop, I take it everywhere.  Plays movies and music great.  The speakers are louder than my husband's HP laptop.  The HDMI output connects to my projector and has great image quality.  The streamed Netflix movies play better than from my desktop.  The recieved wireless signal is stronger than in my old laptop.  Screen is very clear.  Battery life can be very variable.  Windows 7 includes many settings for tailoring the battery life to your usage.

Title: The machine has changed!
Content:
After reading endless reviews about what a pain it is to clean this machine I told my husband, even though he was dying to buy it, that we shouldn't do it because of those reviews. Neither one of us are neat freaks so I could only imagine how horrifically dirty the machine would end up being. However, my husband insisted and bought it anyway. Well, they must have changed the model. Every single part that needs to be cleaned comes out and I just run it under hot water and rinse it clean then stick it back in. It is a piece of cake. I love it. I am so glad we bought it. I never write reviews and I recognize more people tend to be negative because when you are happy with an item you don't find it as necessary to write a review. That is why I made it a point to write this one. There were so many negative reviews but I love this machine.

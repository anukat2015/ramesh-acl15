Title: What a relief.
Content:
I started out with a little Holmes heater that was $5 cheaper that i got from wal-mart, but the thing was horrible, took forever to heat up a little room even.
I was skeptical of something that looked decent, and assumed it wouldn't perform all that great... but boy was i surprised.
Heats up real quick, nice auto temp set of 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, and 'Max'.. along with manual settings, and oscillating that creates no more noise than the heater does, which is minimal for a space heater.  Also has 4, 2, and 1 hr timers on it.
Only downsides, it beeps loud like a microwave with every button you touch, which gets annoying, and it would be nice if they made space heaters with 24 hour timers on them, to plan heating for when i wake up, but none of the kind exist.
Great buy, i think it was 40ish from wal-mart, very happy with it.

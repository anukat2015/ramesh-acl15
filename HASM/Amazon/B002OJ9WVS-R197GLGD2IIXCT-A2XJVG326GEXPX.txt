Title: As good as European brands
Content:
After living in Europe for a year and experiencing how superior several of their appliances are, I was very disappointed to come home and use my American vacuum which was loud, heavy, bulky and a horrible mess to deal with when the bagless container was full.   Though the price put my purchase on hold for a while, I finally bit the bullet and bought the Miele Polaris Canister vacuum.  I love it and have no regrets.  It is just as light and quiet as the European vacuum I had been using, possibly even quieter.  I wish that I could buy the vacuum bags locally but it's nothing a little foresight scan't solve.  The cord is a bit short (I can rarely vacuum beyond one room) but an extension cord which I store with the vacuum easily makes up for that.  I did buy the parquet floor brush to use on my hardwood and tile floors and found it much easier to use than the combination carpet / smooth floor tool that came with the vacuum (I use that one on the area rugs).  This is a quality product that I believe I will have with me for many years to come.

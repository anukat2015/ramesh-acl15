Title: Wonderful compact space heater.
Content:
I purchased this space heater for my wife last week and so far she loves it! She mainly uses it in the bathroom when she showers in the morning and at night.
Pro's:
- Small and compact.
- heats within seconds.
- nice thermostat feature.
- very affordable.
- Can heat a small to medium sized room within 5-10 minutes.
- Relatively quiet, all you hear is some fan noise.
Cons:
- Cheap packaging.
- knobs can be a little difficult to turn.
- Carry handle is not deep enough.
For the price, this is a great heater. I would definitely recommend it!

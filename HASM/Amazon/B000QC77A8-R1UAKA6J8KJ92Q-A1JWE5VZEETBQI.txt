Title: Great Heater OVER A YEAR OLD GOING STRONG
Content:
YES IHAVE 3 OF THEM NOW AND IT IS OVER A YEAR NOW AND ALL ARE WORKING GREAT AS OF 3/31/2010. I have just purchased the 3rd heater of this model. The temp works just like they say, and is right on target. Set it at 72 and it kicks off at 74 and starts up at 71. The fan is quiet. As a safty they use and over heat sensor that works to cut the heater off if the air flow is blocked. I would still like to have a tip over switch. I did place my unit on it's face to see what would happen, and it did sut down within 15 sec. Other than the tip over switch that I would like as a back up. I have hunted the internet for hours and not found a better unit. Hope this helps you. If it will last more than a year, that would be very good.
Good luck Jerry

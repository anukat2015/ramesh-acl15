Title: This is still the Best!!
Content:
None of the others have "line-out" and this has two line-outs and an optical out  let alone usb and firewire trnsfer modes.  Why on earth would you get one the others that only have a headphone jack which is a lousy signal compared to line-out.  If you want to have the option for this to be the center of your sound system in addition to headphones...ya' better have line-out!!!!!  Neither I-Pod nor Zen have line-out!!!!!

Title: Keep the dog away
Content:
While this is a nice unit, it does have a significant drawback.  All controls are not on the cabinet.  The remote control is required.  If the dog chews the remote, you will be up the creek without a paddle.  (Actually, they do give you an extra remote, but after that you are on your own.)  Don't try ordering another remote from Amana... this unit is an Amana in name only and is not supported by Amana.  All that said... I kept the unit anyway.

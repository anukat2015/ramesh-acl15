Title: Not bad if you are directly under it.
Content:
Bought this to heat an insulated,2 bay garage/shop.  Not bad it you are directly under it, but five feet out and your out of it's line of fire.  It you turn it on 30-60 min earlier, you will take the chill off.  Should have gotten the next size up, this would be great for a single car garage.  Overall, it beats not having a heater.
Also, it does recommend you cut a "vent" in your wall above it and have an opening below it (like a window open a couple inches for ventilation.

Title: Best vacuum I have owned
Content:
I love, love, love this vacuum.  I did lots of research before deciding on purchasing the Miele.  I chose this model because it has all the features I needed from the higher priced models and the only difference I can see is that it has a dial control for the suction instead of an "automatic" suction control feature.  I have mostly hardwood and tile flooring with some berber carpet and a few oriental carpets.  I have the smaller 10 1/2 powerhead and that works really well for maneuvering around hard to reach places and gets into corners beautifully.  It picks up pet hair like a dream (I have 3 Weimaraners and Persian cat). I love the parquet floor tool too - I can finally say goodbye to my swiffer.
I have vacuumed my entire house nearly everyday since I purchased it, mostly because it just makes the job so much easier than my old Oreck upright.  My husband thinks I need a job as a Miele spokesperson.

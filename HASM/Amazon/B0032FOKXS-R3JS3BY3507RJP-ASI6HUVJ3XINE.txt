Title: Asus Elan Smart-Pad...dumb
Content:
Got this VT a few days ago. It is an awesome upgrade from my Eee 1005 of last year. Really fast, even after loading it up with all my stuff and not removing any of the usual junk with a new computer. I would have said 5 stars, but the new "Smart-Pad" is not too good...slow to track across screen & not adjustable, old one on Eee much better. I suppose I will adjust, but as I keep going back to my old Eee, I keep enjoying the old feel & speed of the touch pad.

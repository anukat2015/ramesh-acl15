Title: Great camera - Great camera
Content:
I am getting amazingly strong action photos at little league games. The focus is solid. The images are outstanding. One of my photographers shoots with a Nikon D5000 with a 75/300 VR lens. The photos off the Pentax are as strong if not stronger. You get everything for about $700. The 55/300 Pentax lens is sold by itself for $300. Very few pics are out of focus when shooting at 4.7 fps. Enjoy the camera.

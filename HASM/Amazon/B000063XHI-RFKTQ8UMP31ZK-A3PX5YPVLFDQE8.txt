Title: This is the best coffee maker I have ever owned
Content:
I spent hours researching coffee makers before ordering the Capresso. My research time was well spent as this Capresso makes great coffee.  The coffee is ready quickly, is very hot and remains hot for several hours.  If I could think of anything to complain about it is that the pot does not pour easily.  However, all the good things about it make it easy to overlook that one small thing.

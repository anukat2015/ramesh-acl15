Title: AWESOME--nit pick complaints only
Content:
this heater is very good.  my apartment has two electric wall heaters for ~800sq ft.  Last winter we had to abandon the living room cause they couldn't keep it warm enough and the bill one month was $90!!!!  Im talking like low 60's in the apartment and the living room heater just couldn't keep up.  we were quite upset.
This year, I haven't used either of those heaters and at one point our apartment was at 79 degrees.  hadn't quite figured out the timer thing yet and the true meaning of the settings!!!!  We keep our apartment in the mid 70's and the highest bill so far was $120, which is great, $30 more for 15 degree difference!!!!!!  very good deal
complaints,
when it turns on after being off for awhile, it makes popping sounds like a frying pan with oil that has a few drops of water in it.  It was kinda of loud and it didn't always do this, it just started, maybe its stopped or we just got used to it but i haven't noticed it lately.
well worht the money, two thumbs up

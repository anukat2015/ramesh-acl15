Title: The best ipod ever!!!
Content:
The new ipod Nano is the best ipod i have ever had. I had a 30gb video and it broke, so i almost got a Zune, but i like the size of the ipod Nano better. I'm glad I got the ipod, the new interface is really cool and it has alot of extras. Also, I got a blue 16gb for $165 shipped!! Cheaper then the Zune 16gb. GO APPLE!!

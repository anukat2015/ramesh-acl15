Title: LOVE this camera
Content:
I'm not a fanboy of any model and don't know a lot about digital photography. Several years ago I purchased a Canon a70 as I was quite involved as an eBay powerseller and needed a small point and shoot to sell my wares. I purchased photoshop and away I went. I was most impressed with the clarity of the a70 images for being less than 4mp.
I've yet to read the entire instruction manual for the a200 as I was told the best way to get familiar with the camera was to simply spend time taking photos. I sense this is excellent advice.
I'm glad I purchased this model (as well as a warranty) as I plan to take many photos of my friends (and pets) as they're lovely people, and well, animals seem to photograph very well.
I am impressed with the number of features on the a200 and I certainly like the anti-shake correction,,,the feature which sold me on this model. I understand that Sony builds the anti-shake feature into the body and most other camera makers build the anti-shake into the lenses?
I was tempted to buy the a350 as I have big hands and it has a bigger body, however, the a350 felt like too much camera as I am new to digital photography. I've yet to play around with the ISO feature however, I understand that the ISO rating related to film speed??
I'm excited to play around with the features and test my luck with taking black and white photos. 
I have a Great Dane and I'm sure she won't mind if I take 20 or 2000 photos of her. I'm somewhat excited to use her image on this years Christmas card.
I am open to any feedback and suggestions. Thanks for reading my post.

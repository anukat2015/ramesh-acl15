Title: Best Value for your Money
Content:
As a programmer/webmaster, I am usually upgrading/fixing my old computers for experience. However, after a CCFL (backlight) failure I decided it was finally time to upgrade past my 2gb RAM and eternally failing HP Pavilion; within a week, I had decided from a concatenation of research that the panoply of options available for the new model of the Satellite were definitely worth the amazing price. 
At first I may have been wary of the smaller screen size, but after about a day of using it everything suddenly became copasetic. If you are really worried about the size, just get a second monitor for home-use. Also, the dual core on this tiny beast is FAST. And using the Eco mode, I have been able to effectively carry around my laptop for about 48 hours without the battery even coming close to running out, even while using it for about 9 of those hours!
Now it's definitely true that the trackpad has some problems; the simple solution: get an external mouse. All around I am very impressed with the device. Now I just need to find a reasonable way to fill 500gb of hard drive space.

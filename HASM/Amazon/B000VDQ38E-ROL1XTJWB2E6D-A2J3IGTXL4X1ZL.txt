Content:
I read Owen's review and after having tried and returned a Dyson myself, thought the Bissell Pet hair Eraser might be more cost-effective.
Well, as it turns out, I ended up returning the Bissell and getting a different Dyson model (DC-17).  I'm not the type to jump on a bandwagon, but after comparing these, I have to admit the Dyson is by far the better machine.
Here's what I didn't like about the Bissell:
- It's LOUD.  There's also a high frequency component to the noise which I really don't like.
- The dirt container is quite small, and requires frequent emptying (2 - 3 x per room).  When removing it, fine dust tends to spill around the vacuum and floor.
- The upper tank clogs frequently because dog hair clogs the air entry.  Removal and cleaning of the inner cyclone is a pain, and a dirty job too.
- The rotating floor brush -- doesn't.  It frequently stops moving.  The height adjustment, even when set to MAX doesn't seem to work.  This resulted in the vacuum being REALLY hard to push over carpet, and also limited its effectiveness.
- The tools fall off.
- The pet hair-lifter is an ineffective gimmick.
I paid $190 CAD for this vacuum, so it is certainly cheaper that the Dyson, but having compared the two, my opinion is that with the Bissell, you I didn't get what I paid for.  
I should also mention that after cleaning with the Bissell, I could still see pet hair on the carpet despite having vacuumed the area repeatedly.  A few days later when I bought the Dyson and went over the same area, I could not see any hair on the carpet.

Title: Great ipod
Content:
This is a great choice for users who might not have alot of music or videos to store on their ipod. Its only 4GB which is like probably 1,000 songs or a little bit more and over 100 hrs of video. I mean, its good, but I own the ipod Touch and i love that, i just got this for my girlfriend and she doesn't listen to no damn 16GB worth of music so i got her this. Im not cheap, but it doesn make sense though. Why get a 16GB ipod, especially a touch and don't really use it to the fullest.But she loves is and i figure you would too if you don't need higher storage (GB).

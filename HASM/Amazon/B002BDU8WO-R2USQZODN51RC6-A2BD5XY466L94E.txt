Title: lousy repair service
Content:
I bought this laptop a few months ago, and it worked just fine until recently when it started having problems recharging. I subsequently discovered that Toshiba does not have a helpful repair system. I called Toshiba twice. The second time it was determined that the problem was the battery, but even though I told them I was going to be out of the country a week later, and had already made a service call a week earlier, they were not willing to send me a new battery in less time than ten business days, so not in time for me to take my computer with me, even though it was still under warranty. 
It was also not possible to just go to a service center in my area to have the battery replaced because the policy is that all the computers of this type are sent to Toshiba depot for repair. 
So, no matter what problem one may run into, it will take a mimumum of ten business days to have it fixed, which implies that this computer is not a good option for people who cannot miss their computer for that much time.

Title: You Know You're Going To Buy It Anyway
Content:
I've owned this for over six months. All of the good and bad reviews are accurate.  This is a cheap (VERY cheap - I took it apart and studied it) and somewhat reliable coffee maker.  But, it will develop all of the problems over time: moisture entering the controller area, display, and buttons; the mildly annoying (and cheap) movable dispenser, so called leak proof spout (because it's cheap!), etc.  The coffee is hot.  The heating element ensures that the coffee is hot enough to cause physical damage to mouth tissue.  This is Hamilton Beach's way of preventing you from drinking the horrible, toxic-tasting coffee.  No matter what brand coffee you buy, it will taste like ten year old antifreeze.  Some spilled on the floor, and my dog took a taste before running outside and gulping down all of the snow in front of the house.
So why would I suffer through this for over half a year?  Because it was the only coffee I was drinking for all that time, and I thought it was supposed to taste that way.  When the unit broke, I had to buy instant coffee, and was shocked at how good it tasted.  Also, I thought I was smart buying such an inexpensive (I mean CHEAP!) product.
I was greedy and went ahead and clicked on that Add To Cart button.  Don't do it!

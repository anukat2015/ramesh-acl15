Title: nikon d40x review
Content:
Nikon D40X 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)We were new to digital cameras, wanted a good one to take pictures of our new grandchild. Our son is a professional photographer and has used Nikon cameras extensively. He did some research and suggested this one. We were not disappointed,instructions are clear and easy to understand,though I must admit, he set it up for me. It is user friendly and the results were very good--for portraits, action shots and landscapes.I will need more time to get a better feel for lighting--some pictures were a bit yellow in hue. We look forward to many more opportunities to practice our new skills.

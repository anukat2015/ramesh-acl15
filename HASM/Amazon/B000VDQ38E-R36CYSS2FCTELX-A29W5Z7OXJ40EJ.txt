Title: 5 star vacuum
Content:
I bought this vacuum after I read the reviews from this website, and I was right, it does exactly what it says, all the pet hair was cleaned from my carpet and wood floor, I have a golden retriever dog and he sheds all the time, and this vacuum did the job. Some people mentioned that it is heavy and noisy, not at all, the noise is normal and even lower than my old Hoover, and the weight is also normal for an electric vacuum is its size, I gave it 5 star because it cleaned my house really good.

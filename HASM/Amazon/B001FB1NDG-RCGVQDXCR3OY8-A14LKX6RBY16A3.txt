Title: Fits All My Needs
Content:
I purchased this in April, 2009 to replace my 8gb player.  So far so good.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  I saw other reviews complain about the sound but I don't see anything wrong with it.  I lost the stylus pen so I use my fingers and the touch pad responds quickly.  I can lock it so I don't accidently touch anything when not in use.  I use it on the train to and from work to listen to music which amounts to 3 hours a day.  The battery life for is 10-12 hours (usually around 11) but it does differ.
In all I'm very happy with it.  Its a great player at a cheap price.  I wouldn't mind buying other electronics from this company.

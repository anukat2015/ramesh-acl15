Title: Best features for the price
Content:
I looked around for about two months for a new computer. When my search landed me on this one I was a little hesitant. But the features that come with it are great. When doing research the " new " intel i5 processor was the way to go. It runs fasted than expected. Better than the core 2 duo. Which I use on a daily basis. The 64bit system is great. The hard drive at 500gb is more than expected. Windows 7 very nice and I was a windows XP person. Hated vista. The screen size big at 17.3 inches and very clear. Hooks up easily to any TV with the HDMI port. Had no problems playing CD's and DVD's.  I would suggest getting a wireless mouse and keyboard though. The laptop itself is light weight. A few minor problems when opening I had to let the computer run all programs before I could use it. If you are looking for a new computer I would highly recommend this one for the features and price. Shopped around for months and could not find one.

Title: Yes, it's better than iPod
Content:
I mainly got a Zune because I didn't want to pay for an iPod. Why? Personally, I can't stand iTunes. I am no giant fan of Apple either. Nor am I a fan of that senor wheel. Zune remedies all of this. Some things it doesn't do that great though...
Pros: The Zune software feels exactly like Windows Media Player 11, all of the controls on the device are buttons, the large display helps for movie watching. The price is right too, since last I checked 8G iPods are running the same price as a 30G Zune. Finally, the wireless connectivity of the Zune works out great. The Social network is definitely an interesting feature that everyone with a Zune should at least try. It can also play podcasts.
Cons: I didn't do it because I didn't feel I would need it, but since the price drop I would suggest the extra $50 for the extra 50G. It really is a great deal.The battery life is about 15-20 hours at half volume, not great but good. Also, from time to time the software can be a tad buggy when adding new songs.
I recommend this product for every music listener. Cheaper than an iPod video, and all the same features.

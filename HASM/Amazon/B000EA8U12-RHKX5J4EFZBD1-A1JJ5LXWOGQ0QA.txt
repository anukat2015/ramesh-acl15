Title: Shocking Customer Service - Cheap parts
Content:
I got a new player. The power connector (at the base of the player) got stuck with the player because of over heating (I had connected it for exactly about half an hour to charge it). I could not detach the cable from the player. When I finally did - the whole circuitry ripped off from the player and I could not power it anymore. I had the 90-day warranty that comes with the player. When contacted the customer service - they were rude to the core and said I had inflicted physical damage and they are going to charge me - $ 130 ( I bought it for $160) to repair it. 
I vow I will never ever buy anything from Creative because of the cheap parts and the rude customer service with lying warranties.

Title: Price Point
Content:
I use Amazon for pretty much all my Misc online shopping.  However, Amazon just has too much on it's plate to keep up with computers and laptops...
I just picked this exact same machine(DVD instead of BLU, all other stats the same) up from another site for 250 less and free 3 day ship. I suppose if you are a movie nut that would use the BLU Ray player enought to justify paying that much extra for it, this is the model for you. Searching other top sellers on this site, a lot of people are paying too much for already old models...
Aside from price, the only con I have right now is that this model does not have the "Splash" web button like one of sony's lesser models do.  This is a feature that lets you access the internet with a push of a button without starting up the whole machine.  I was tempted to take a lesser laptop for that feature alone, but ultimately I think I made the right choice for a machine with better performance.
However, that same other site(newegg) didn't have the better deal on the new mp3 player I ordered from amazon>> I was a little upset that Amazon is asking people to pay a processing fee to get their order shipped however... my in stock order didn't get out of the warehouse for almost a week.  Ama is really not my favorite site anymore...

Title: Very good performance
Content:
Bought for my wife-- she loves it and uses it everyday.(to my surprise) I think it should have bass and treble adjustment, but you do hear the music as the artist has intended, though.  Upgrade the headphones, you will hear a difference. Apple should provide better ones at this price.

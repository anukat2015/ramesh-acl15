Title: This WAS going to be a 5-star review but...
Content:
I love this coffee maker... but I'm not IN love with it.  You know what I mean?
It started out as a mad love affair. You know: the hot coffee, the dark red exterior, and I had just gotten over a Cuisinart that died in only 6 months. (Click on the link for my other reviews if you are curious.)  
I know what you are thinking: This Mr. Coffee FTX (model 49, actually) was just a REBOUND coffee maker. I know. I was thinking it too! But I went through and enumerated all the things I love about it while I was trashing the Cuisinart. In the process of writing that review I fell in love all over again.
The thing I love the most, that I have yet to find on any other coffee maker, is the temperature adjustment knob for the warming plate. This is a BIG deal! If you can adjust the warming plate temp then you can keep your coffee at the right temp and not have it burn when there is only a little left. Ecstasy!
However, it was not meant to be. My planned 5-star review had to be dropped down to 4 stars when it died in less than 72 hours. I used my tear-soaked hankerchief to act as a makeshift coffee filter and tea-bag the coffee in a cup of hot water to make due. (Ironically, I think my tears made it taste better!)
I am going to pick up another one today at Target. I hope my heart is not broken again.

Title: overall ok deal...few issues
Content:
I got my 16gb nano for a Hanukkah present because my past reliable 20GB Dell DJ died...I was excited since I heard so many good things and a lot of them were right....it just seems like the battery fluctuates alot when you scroll for songs but eventually ends up going back to where it should be. I have backlight set at low and I turned coverflow off...I use it to walk to and from class and in my car with a tape adapter so it does the job...lets hope the battery doesn't start acting up.

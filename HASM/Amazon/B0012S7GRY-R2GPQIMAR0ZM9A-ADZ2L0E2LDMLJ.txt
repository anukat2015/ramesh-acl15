Title: Was hopeful......but was dissapointed :(
Content:
The iPod Nano 4gb was nice to have at first...but then it crashed several times then repeatedly deleted all my album artwork. iTunes was also a terrible dissapointment, it duplicated every song I had, deleted my album artwork just as the iPod did, and I found it to run terribly slow.
Interface: The user interface on the iPod seems clunky and awkward in comparison to the Zune. The clickwheel isn't very responsive, and sometimes takes quite a bit of movement to respond.
Audio Quality: I was very suprised at how poor the sound quality was on this, I am able to play the same audio files with a generic mp3 player and it sounds better. I'm sorry Apple, but this is not acceptable.
Software: I thought iTunes was a nice music player, and I really like the way that it organizes all my music in nice neat folders :D. unfortunately I've had problems with the artwork as I mentioned before, and I also felt like the features weren't very well organized, like they tried to cram too many things into the program.
Overall, I'm don't think I'll be buying Apple for some time. I'll stick with a much more reliable product such as the Zune until Apple figures out all its major glitches.

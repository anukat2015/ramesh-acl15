Title: super coffee
Content:
This is a better coffeemaker than I thought I would get. Must be the water filter.  The coffee is excellent.  I grind my own and found I like using the paper filter better than the included gold reusable one. I grind it pretty fine and the instructions said not to do that or sediment would be in the coffee.  Hubby actually liked that - I did not. I won. Great coffee maker. Will buy it again.

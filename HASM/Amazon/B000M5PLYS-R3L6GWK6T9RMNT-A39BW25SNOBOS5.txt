Title: puts out heat quickly for such a small device
Content:
I bought this for my father's bathroom so he could turn it on and be warm after he showers. It's compact and fits perfectly in a spot between the shelving and doorway. I had thought this device doubled as a cooling fan but it's just a heater. The blower pushes out a good amount of heat and it works great for the small room.

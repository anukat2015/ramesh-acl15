Title: mp3 player
Content:
this product is my first mp3 player and i'd have to say that over all im pretty content. getting started with it was pretty hard. it was confusing on how exactly to get the files i downloaded onto my mp3 player. after a few hours i finally got it. and then it was stuck on the &amp;amp;quot;music&amp;amp;quot; screen and then it would just shut off. eventually it worked (dont ask me how).  
 i would also have to say that the keypad is pretty difficult to control. the slighest touch will hit the other button. also, there is NO off button. so yeah...idk if you are really good with electronics then i'd say this is a great product,i thought i was until now... good luck

Title: D3 is not worth it
Content:
Where do I start?  It's mediocre camera at best in professional world.  My Nikon F5 is just as fast and produces perfect quality photos as opposed to D3 as well as being useful in places like Alaska where you can't easy charge your battery on D3.  My Sigma SD14 outperforms D3 in quality and color accuracy at ISO100 RAW.  My Hasselblad and 45 View cameras can never be touched in image quality by D3.  The only OK aspect of D3 is it's performance at 3200 or so.  However, the image quality is so bad that only a desperate journalist may want to use those photos professionally.  They do have a lot of noise at 3200 when blown up large, so only small size prints can be made successfully with D3 at 3200 ISO.  Even though D3 can take photos up to 25,000 ISO, they are not really usable.  Most photographers will be better served by other cameras.  If you must have low light capability, D700 is way cheaper and just as equal to D3 in low light.  D3x would be a better camera if you are willing to spend over $5,000 on a body.  And if you want to see just how bad D3 is at high ISO, use 50mm/1.4, 24-70mm/2.8 or another high quality lens, and those lenses will expose weaknesses of the sensor in terms of image quality.

Title: Forget Cannon and Nikon and Sony.. this is the real deal
Content:
I researched heavily in the internet about SLR cameras before I took the plunge.  Afterall, if you are going to spend this much money on a gadget, you better be careful and that you get the best bang for the buck.  Almost all editorials from SLR experts are unanimous about this model being superior to Canon and Nikon offerings.  This 2008 model has all the 4 features that are most desired in a modern SLR, which are: a live view display, dust protection mechanism, image stabilization and dynamic color range.  Among its class and price range, this camera is the only one that has it all.  When I saw the price discounted to almost half and a few hundred dollars less than comparable Nikon and Cannon and Sony offerings (these three brands actually received less favorable ratings but are significantly more expensive), I thought it was a no-brainer.  I had to look twice at the price to make sure I was not mistaken.  Indeed, for a lot less dollar but with a lot more features and quality, this item is real steal!

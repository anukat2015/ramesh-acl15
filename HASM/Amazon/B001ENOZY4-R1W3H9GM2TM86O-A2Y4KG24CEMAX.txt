Title: D90 W/18-105VR
Content:
The D90 is a beautiful camera.  If you're thinking about a D5000, D60, or lower grade, forget it.  Just buy the D90.  You'll be very happy you did and won't outgrow it as fast, if at all.  I will plug the D5000...it's a nice camera as well...D60 size/weight/feel, with most D90 guts.  However, you might as well spend a bit more and go with the D90, especially with the 18-105VR kit lens.  That lens, in my opinion, is better than the 18-55VR, despite what Ken Rockwell says about it. 
There's no comparable camera that Cannon makes unless you step up a little to the EOS 50D W/28-135.  The build quality of the Nikon is superior...period!  Don't think about the Cannon T1i either.  The T1i 15.1 mp is a gimmick and you'll find too many quirks and features lacking in comparison to the D90.  People have tried to compare the T1i to the D90.  The D90 wins hands down.  Just search for D90 VS T1i.  You'll see the reviews.
One of my favorite features of the D90, unlike the D80, is the fact that you can display shooting information on the rear LCD with the push of the info button or flip of the pwr switch.  The D5000 and lower use the rear LCD for shooting information, since they lack a top LCD.  Of course, you have the option to just use the D90 top LCD as you would on the D80.
Bottom line:  The D90 is a beautiful camera, which takes superb high resolution pictures with minimal effort.  Buy it, you'll be happy you did!  $1,139 on Amazon with free shipping...excellent price.  Also, Amazon.com is an authorized Nikon dealer if you check Nikon's website for authorized retailers. 
Note: I won't get into all the details of of the D90 because if you're serious about a camera such as this, then you really need to read reviews of this camera and make comparisons to others.  Please do your own homework!!!  ;)

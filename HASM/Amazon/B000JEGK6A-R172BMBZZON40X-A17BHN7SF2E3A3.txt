Title: The little heater that could
Content:
As others have noted, this heater is smaller than I imagined, but it does a good job of heating up a 14X14' room on cold days.
When I first turned it on, I noticed that the fan did not produce much force. I actually thought it was broken, but after a few minutes my room was warm.
Also, as others have noted, the unit is well-built and solid. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star rating is I feel the fan could be a bit more powerful.

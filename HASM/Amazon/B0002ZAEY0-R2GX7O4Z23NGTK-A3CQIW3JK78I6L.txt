Title: Just what I Needed
Content:
I have a large CD collection and a job that makes me relocate frequently.  I like to have access to my music between moves, and now, for the first time, I can have all of it conveniently at my fingertips.  Not to mention at the office, on the go -- a truly revolutionary product.  Works awesome as a music storage and playback device.
The picture function is nice, but don't get it for that.  The screen is too small to really enjoy pictures with, and it will get scrathed up.  There's almost no way to avoid this.  Mine was scratched in a couple days.  Not horribly, but you notice it with pics.  You don't notice if you're just reading a song or album description.
In short, it works as advertised, it it's just what I needed.

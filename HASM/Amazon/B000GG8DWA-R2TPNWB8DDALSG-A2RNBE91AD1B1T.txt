Title: Heater with no thermostat
Content:
This heater is okay, but I didn't realize when I bought it that it didn't have a thermostat control. I purchased it for a room in my parent's house that needs to stay warm because of some equipment. However, without a thermostat, it just keeps running and you can't control the temperature. So, I was disappointed and had to find another heater to do the job. If you don't need that control, it's a good heater and produces a good amount of heat for a small room.

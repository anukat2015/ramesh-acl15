Title: I gave it four stars because I haven't had it long
Content:
This Hoover is light and compact. It has good suction. The attachments will fall off if they are not inserted properly. The cord automaticaly retracts so there are no cords to wrap around and no belts to replace as you use Hoover bags that you can purchase right here on Amazon. The color is nice. So far, I have no complaints. The price is right and it does more then what I paid for in all honesty. I also like that I can carry it around easily or roll it from section to section. It works well on my carpet and hardwood floors.

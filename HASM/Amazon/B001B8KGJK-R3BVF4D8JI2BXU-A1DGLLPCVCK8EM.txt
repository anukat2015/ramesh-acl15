Title: If it overheats, you're screwed
Content:
The short review: 
Worked great for a month, then it overheated and wouldn't turn on. Apparently, once it overheats, the on/off switch will melt shut, forcing you to either send it in or trash it for a new one. Quality of this heater is low.
The long(er) review:
I bought this heater at a local store, not on Amazon.com, but the review still stands. It worked great for the majority of the winter. Heats a small room fairly quickly on the highest heat setting, but it has no digital display to set an exact temperature setting. It also does not heat the floor, unlike cheaper, similar units. If you leave the heater on overnight, you run the risk of melting the on/off switch into the off position. This can be fixed, but you only have 2 choices if you want to fix it.
1) Send the heater in to Kaz/Honeywell, let them force you to pay $10 to fix the heater, along with postage paid by you and be out of heat for a few days/weeks OR
2) Open it up, voiding the warranty, and fix it yourself.
I chose option 2 and after cleaning off the melted plastic (!!) inside the switch (!!), the heater works once again. It's not easy, but who can complain about a working heater?

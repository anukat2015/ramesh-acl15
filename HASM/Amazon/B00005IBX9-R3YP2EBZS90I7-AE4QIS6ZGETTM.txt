Title: Lasted two years
Content:
My coffee maker has been acting rather strange lately, I keep setting it on auto, only to wake up and find it doing a self clean.  Not my error either, this has been going on for a week.  I am about to chuck it in the bin as I am a coffee freak and hate waking up to crappy coffee which has been going through the self clean cycle for I don't know how long.  I thought this coffee maker would last for years since it is a good make and not exactly the cheapest around.  Well I am off to research coffee makers, cheers!

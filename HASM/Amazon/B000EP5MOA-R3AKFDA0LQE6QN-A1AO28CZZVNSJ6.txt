Title: Just fascinating over and over again
Content:
Every time I  look at the little black nano I am surprised about its size, its feel and its capabilities...the menus work well, the wheel responds fast (er than my 30 GB iPOd photo) and updating it via USB isnt as much of a pain inthe brain as I initially feared it might be...
downsides are: 
its either PC or Mac compatibility , NOT both...(and I thought i could use it as a convenient way to transfer files)
and....its princesslike behavior towards anything that touches it...the little jeanpocket Steve put it in? hm. nothing in it...but it has scratches when i took it out...a cloth to polish sunglasses (the high quality super-technical stuff that comes with Ray Bans)..scratches it too...
But this lead to the development of our nano leather sleeves...so bad things have a good outcome sometimes, you can find it by searching for a "nano sleeve" here on amazon. 
Buy a nano, be happy and remember: WRAP WHAT YOU LOVE!

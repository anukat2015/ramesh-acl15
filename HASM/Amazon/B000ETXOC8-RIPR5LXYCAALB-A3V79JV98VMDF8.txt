Title: mp3
Content:
The one major issue I've had so far is trying to figure out how to set up different play lists (an issue I've had with all the MP3 players I've used).  Otherwise, the battery life is great, it sounds wonderful.  I got the DLO action jacket for it, and have been using it at the gym with no skipping.  Great value!

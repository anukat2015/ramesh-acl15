Title: KURV is fantastic
Content:
I have had a Dirt Devil hand vacuum for 3 years and really like it.  When the new KURV came out, I couldn't resist trying it.  It works great and has a lot of power. I never use a broom.  So far, the KURV hasn't run out of power before I finish the kitchen, utility room and 2 bathrooms (the rooms without carpet).  It is the first hand vac I have had that doesn't start running out of power and slowing down before I am finished.

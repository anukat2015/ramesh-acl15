Title: Great Vacuum but very messy
Content:
The vacuum itself is great but once you have to clean the canister and the filter all of the dust that it collects just goes back into the air. Don't get me wrong the vacuum works wonderfully but it just so hard to clean out the canister and filter without making a giant mess.

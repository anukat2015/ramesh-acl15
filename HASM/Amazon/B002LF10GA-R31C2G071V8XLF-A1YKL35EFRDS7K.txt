Title: Possible Regular Laptop Replacement
Content:
I've owned several netbooks/small computers over the years and this is the only one that I would consider as`a replacement for my laptop.  Comes with Vista Premium which it runs OK with a free upgrade to Win7.  Win7 RC1 runs much better than Vista.  In Win7 RC1, it actually "feels" like a laptop and has a Performance Index of 3.2, this is much better than the Atom based netbooks.  Slingbox, Netflix, ESPN360, Hulu, and Youtube all run fine.  Battery will last about 4.5 hours when continuously streaming video.  I wish this were longer since larger laptops in the Acer Timeline Series last longer.  No bluetooth.  I've had the chance to use this computer for a few more days and I must say that I continue to be impressed.  My impression of Acer   used to be that their products were low priced, but not necessarily the best performance or highest quality.  Acer appears to have produced a real winner with this one, incorporating great value into a quality machine..

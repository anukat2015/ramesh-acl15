Title: I'd rather have bought something else
Content:
Yes, this is a powerful vacuum.  Yes, it sucks up a lot of hair and dirt. 
Yes, you have to clean the filters frequently. Yes, the HEPA filter needs replacing frequently (read - $$$)  Yes, at least 1-2 of the attachments will 'die' within your first 5-10 uses.
If I had to do-over, I would have gotten a vacuum with filters I can clean, and attachments that are sturdier.  The felt 'hair pickup' in front doesn't do anything.

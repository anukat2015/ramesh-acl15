Title: DONT BY HP!!!
Content:
Pros: it turns on
Cons: very very very poor customer service
buggy volume control
mouse buttons are stiff and not good for extended use, "my thumbnail is bent from pressin on it"
if you have a problem, good luck getting it fixed customer service it terrible,
It runs slow and I bought 4 gb of ram
It gets hot
battery life is short
Summary: first night I had it a yellow line appeared on my screen,
when I called customer service they made me jump through all of these hoops
I've spent over 3hrs on the phone with them trying to get them to ship me a box
so I can send it back, and I'm still waiting, in fact i'm on hold with them right now.
BEEN ON THE PHONE FOR 55MINS
I've had the same problems as the other people who posted here,
Customer service is very vindictive/uncaring
I tried writing a review on HPs site, and they didnt post it, to me, that speaks volumes.
you need this laptop like you do a hole in the head,
if your a pro who works on their computer, opt for something a little more expensive,
it'll be worth it,

Title: Great Heater
Content:
I bought this heater for my dad and he loves it. He said it only smells for a brief minute when starting and stopping it. This is natural for Kerosene heaters. If you use good quality kerosene it will keep the smell, if any, to a minimum.
It only takes a few seconds to lite and is at full flame within a minute.
The fan is whisper quiet and barley noticeable. The fan plugs into the wall but the ignitor requires batteries. 
I would buy one of these again especially at this price. ($130 shipped).

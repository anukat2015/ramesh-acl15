Title: Good if you have the money, not good if you don't have the money
Content:
Zune is really good, but in order to continue to play your music you have to subscribe to them paying a pricey fee. So if you have the money go for it...but if you don't have much money I don't recomend it. I can't play any of my own music anymore since I unsubscribed...so I can't play any music on my computer any more even the ones that where there before I got Zune. It plays just fine on the device but its just those music on my device that play...the rest is history...even my favorites that I burned onto a cd will not play.

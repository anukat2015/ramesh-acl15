Title: TOO disappointing
Content:
Positive: nice red color
Negative:  How much space do I have?  Seriously, the Melitta coffee pods are hard to find unless you order through the mail.  There are few varieties and it is not particularly appealing in any flavor.  Although there are plenty of other pod options @ the grocery, they are just a bit too big to fit well without causing most of the coffee to leak into the drip tray rather than flow to the cup.  Sometimes I can get the pod almost properly positioned resulting in a fair cup of coffee & not too much mess to clean up. (I can appreciate the other reviewers who wrote how to trouble shoot some of these glitches - but I paid good money for a new coffee maker from a "brand" company so had some expectations....)  The worst part is that when I politely wrote Melitta to express my disappointment they were not even courteous enough to reply to my correspondence.

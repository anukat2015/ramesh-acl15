Title: Great Coffeemaker
Content:
I brought this coffeemaker because my previous coffeemaker stopped functioning. I'm glad I chose this one because it works great. I love it, especially the gold filter, which I've never had before. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the top of the carafe, which has a removable lid, but other then that this is a great product.

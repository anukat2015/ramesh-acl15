Title: cocoa is fantastic, but not cleaning
Content:
I got this as a gift for Christmas. It makes a fantastic cocoa and frothed milk for my coffee.  However, the cleaning is kind of hard.  The milk get stucked in the bottom and I have to clean it about three times after use to get the milk out.  It beats warming the milk in the microwave, and the milk comes out really creamy.  I use skim milk but it has wonderful results.  My kids already love the hot cocoa it makes.  It is also great to make hot water for tea.  I do think it is a great product but would like to see its design improved.
I have stopped using it now because of the work to clean it up.  Too bad because the concept is wonderful but I do not have the extra time it takes to clean it up.

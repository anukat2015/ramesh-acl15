Title: Product Exceeds Expectations
Content:
We have two dogs and we needed something to pick up dog hair on hardwood floors. We tried dust mops, Swiffers, and carpet sweepers and all were OK but just that. The Dirt Devil KRUZ met our needs in all respects. It has more than adequate power, the charge lasts for plenty of time, and the charger is very easy to use. Removal, clean out, and replacement of the debris container are easy procedures. We would have preferred a slightly longer handle and a somewhat lower profile that would allow better access under furniture but these are minor issues. For our purposes, it is hard to imagine a better product. Dirt Devil KRUZ 0313SLV Cordless Floor Cleaner

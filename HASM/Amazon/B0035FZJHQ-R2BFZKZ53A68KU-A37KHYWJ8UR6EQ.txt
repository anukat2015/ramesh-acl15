Title: I'm in love.
Content:
For the past 8 years I've been using a point-and-shoot Sony DSC-F717, which has served me quite well for what I was doing and actually had really good image quality.
I've been following closely, over the past few years, the developments and price cuts of entry level DSLRs and am glad I waited this long! Once I noticed that manufacturers were adding video capabilities, I knew waiting a little while longer, until they got it just right, would pay off.
I'm thrilled with this purchase and as an amateur, of course, there is much to learn. Here are a few observations from using the camera for the past 2 days:
* RAW files from this camera not supported in OS X yet
* MOV files created will test your computers speed
* MOV files in 1080p will eat up ~330MB/min and use ~15mbit/s bitrate
* Good starter lens, but I can already tell I'll want something to supplement it
* Great fit and finish
* Very light

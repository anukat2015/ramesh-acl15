Title: Nikon D300
Content:
This is one heck of a camera. I have had Nikons (F5, F, 8008, F4), Canons (Rebel), Leica (M3, IIIc), and Hasselblad (500 CM) and I think this is the best I've had in terms of feel, features, and picture quality. I'm slowly putting it through its paces and find the camera to be responsive and easy to use. I thought that I would be intimidated by the controls, but am picking things up pretty quickly. It's getting me back into photography and makes it all fun again!

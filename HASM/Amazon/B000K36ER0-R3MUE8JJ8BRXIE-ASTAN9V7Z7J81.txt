Title: Retiring this to move onto the world of GOOD coffee makers.
Content:
At first, I went along with the feeling that I purchased a good coffee maker. I figured it would be pretty hard to make a coffee maker bad... I was wrong. After a couple months I had my first startup problems and then problems with the coffee not dispensing into the pot turning into an overflow in the filter compartment. While these problems were very uncommon they did occur more than once... The startup would fix after a picking it up and slamming it to the counter. Happened about 10 times in a year. The overflow in the filter compartment about 35 times out of 365 days... While it got me through the work days, in the end it's still a cheap coffee maker. Feels cheap & just doesn't look right. And I am also retiring this because it uses what I consider an inferior method of brewing... A bad drip over the grounds / uneven & superheated water just before it drips onto the grounds. The good ones heat the water in the reservoir before its sprayed correctly onto the coffee grounds. Now I can enjoy a maker that brews it right, no scorched taste and is engineered a million times better. I have advanced to the world of bunn.

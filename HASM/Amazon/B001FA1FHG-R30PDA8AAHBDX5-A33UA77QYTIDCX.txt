Title: Absolutely awesome!
Content:
I saw this product in Bed, Bath and Beyond, and fell in love with it instantly.  After bringing it home, I loved it even more.  The heat is awesome...I have to keep it at the lowest setting because of the intense heat it throws at a higher setting.  It's just amazing.  I keep the "crackling" sound at the lowest, and it is such a soothing sound.  My husband fell asleep on the couch about 15 minutes after it was plugged in and turned on.  It looks beautiful and heats fantastic...what more could you want from an electric heater??  I love it, and would recommend it to anyone!

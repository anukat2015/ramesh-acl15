Title: Beware the cup filter
Content:
Perhaps I have been brainwashed into believing that the method of brewing coffee influences flavor, but I have been using a cone style filter for most of my adult life and was shocked when I opened this coffee maker and discovered it had a cup-style filter (not mentioned anywhere I could see in the advertisements for it). As with another reviewer, the temperature was much lower than my favorite old Cuisinart which broke down after many years of daily-plus use, and the coffee cooled down in my cup before I was even halfway finished with it. I packaged this DeLonghi back up and went and replaced my Cuisinart with the identical one I have used for years.

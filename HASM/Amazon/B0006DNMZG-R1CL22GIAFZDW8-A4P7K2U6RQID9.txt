Title: Nice little heater:
Content:
I previously had purchased this same heater about 6 or 7 years back in the white, and it recently died, so I opted to purchase again the same one, only this time in black (or is it charcoal grey?)!
It's a good and dependable heater and doesn't use a whole lot of energy, and it just perfect for the small room that it is kept in, which isn't insulted very well and can get quite cold during the winter months...
I do recommend this heater for small rooms - there are two other models of this heater which would accommodate larger rooms. This little heater I will say is not meant for large rooms and for that, I would get something bigger and more powerful!

Title: I am loving this computer!
Content:
I am not a gamer, so made the financial decision to purchase the X5 rather than the A1 because I didn't need the enhanced graphics capabilities.
This is a very attractive, eye-catching unit: I receive compliments every time I open it in public.
It's fast, it's quiet, it has VERY long battery life, and it does what it's supposed to do.
Caveats: Yes, it is a fingerprint magnet -- there isn't a surface you can touch on which you won't leave a print or smudge. But it cleans as easily as it smudges. Yes, the screen does have a limited viewing angle. But how often do you change your vertical position while using a computer. Yes, it does come with an enormous amount of pre-installed software. But it does give you the option of reformatting the hard drive to remove partitions and only install what you want.
There is no reason to complain about the trackpad -- it's easy to use and works like a charm.
So far, then, so good. I've owned laptop and notebook computers from Tandy, IBM, Dell, Toshiba, and Fujitsu -- this is my first Asus.

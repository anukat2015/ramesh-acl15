Title: electric fireplace
Content:
I bought this fireplace heater for my daughter who has a regular fireplace but does not have the time to cut wood, transport wood or clean up the mess left from a wood burning fireplace. The answer for us was the Dimplex insert. It took about 5 minutes from the time I opened the box to have the insert up and running. It fit easily into the fireplace opening and the remote control is as simple as they get.We really didn't care about the heater part of the unit, but it works just fine. I would buy another if I needed it.

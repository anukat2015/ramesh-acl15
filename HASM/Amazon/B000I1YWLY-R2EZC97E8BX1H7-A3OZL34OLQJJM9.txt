Title: Great product, if you can find it
Content:
This vacuum works amazingly well, but it does not have a neat name, no major reviews and only a few places even sell it.
The only odd thing about it is the carpet head only turns in one direction (great if you are right handed).  Have no clue why they did that.
Even the bagless works great and can be cleaned without making a mess.
Best vacuum we have ever had, best I have ever seen.

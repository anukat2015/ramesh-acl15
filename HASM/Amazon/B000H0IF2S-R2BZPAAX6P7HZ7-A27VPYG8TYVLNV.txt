Title: Great Tough Product
Content:
We have gone through too many iPods, but this one is tough and so small.  At $75, it also is less of a loss than the iPod 60GB!  Perfect for the gym, the beach, where ever.  Easy to manage and maintain.  Still use the other iPods that have not broken yet, this is the unit of choice in my book.
Also, Amazon turned around the order in three days under its 'standard' free shipping.  Why pay more?

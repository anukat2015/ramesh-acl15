Title: Not a ground breaking...review!
Content:
This particular model of Ipod recieved the most new features. So much so, that I sold my Ipod classic to have those features. It is a great deal with all of the features. This is literally an extremely portable media machine. Basically every kind of media can be on here, except books. Photos, music, movies,tv shows, audiobooks, games, videos and the ability to record video, allows you to make videos and extract images from them.
While the video function is not the best, it is great start and with all the other media availble this becomes a great deal. The video even has built-in effects. This was one of those few purchases you do where you feel like you got your moneys worth.Enjoy!

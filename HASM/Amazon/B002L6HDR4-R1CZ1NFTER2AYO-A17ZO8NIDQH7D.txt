Title: Great item you can have so much fun with
Content:
I always thought that I don't need an ipod but now I'm so happy that I have one. The sound is great and it just looks so nice. It's very easy to use even if you did not use itunes before. What I'm a bit disappointed about is that the battery life is to short. I'm using my Ipod every day and I have to load the battery almost every second day :/ But I still like it

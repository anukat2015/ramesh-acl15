Title: Could be easier to use.
Content:
Having only 1 prior MP3 experience, I expected the ipod to be as easy to use as my last MP3 player. It isn't. I don't find the iPod to be very user friendly. Once you get music on (which has to be purchased from itunes unless you want a big hassle) it is hard to get it back off. There is no way to remove individual songs without rearranging files and folders on your computer and then re-syncing the device.  Overall, I like the iPod itself, but I'm not happy with the software.

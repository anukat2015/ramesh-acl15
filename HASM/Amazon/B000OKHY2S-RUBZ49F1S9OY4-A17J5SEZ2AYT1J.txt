Title: LOVE THIS PRODUCT
Content:
Surprised more people don't know about this product - it's a really great "second-best" alternative to a portable, in-home air conditioner...and much cheaper. I can't have an air conditioner unit because all of my windows slid horizontally. I remembered that when I was young we had a fan that blew air over a tray of water...so I typed "water + fan" into Bing and, voila, up came this product. I took the risk and ordered it and it came quickly, was exactly as advertised and works great. After you fill it with water (or water+ice for even more cooling) the full tank last for weeks (at least the way I use it, which is all day on a low setting when it's hot.
Granted, I live in San Francisco, and"hot" isn't exactly scorching but this is still a terrific product and value for the price. Just don't expect an air conditioner's level of cool - more like a better fan.

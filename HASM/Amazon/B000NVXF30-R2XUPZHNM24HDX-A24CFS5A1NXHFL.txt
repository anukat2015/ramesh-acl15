Title: Olympus E-510
Content:
E-510 is a Olympus's logical step forward in comparison to E-500 which is good entry level photo camera, but E-510 has 10 MPs, Live View function and Image Stabilization button also. Those two possibilities are the ones to separate E-510 among all the cameras of its level. The noise is also reduced and I see no advantages by other cameras. Anyone who'll make decision to buy E-510 has to know that this is good investment. There is one additional thing that can't be skipped - two excellent lens follow Olympus cameras - in my case I bought the body only, but when buying my e500, I received 17.5-45mm and 40-150mm lenses. Both are of a very good quality. Comparing to i.e. Canon, this is a big additional plus for Oly!!

Title: A great SLR for a beginner or anyone really
Content:
I got this about 4 months ago as a present. I must this camera is amazing. I still have yet to master or even start to use 80% of its features. This camera is great for a beginner or really anyone who wants a wonderful yet reasonably priced camera.  
But you might just want to spring for a black one. I am not to crazy about the silver. But hey I am not looking a gift horse in the mouth. 
*UPDATE* After having used it for almost a year I am in LOVE with it!!! It works wonderfully well!!!! No complaints at ALL!!!! To sumrraize you cant go wrong with it!!!!

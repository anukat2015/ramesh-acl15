Title: Never again
Content:
I purchased this heater in hopes to heat a medium-sized bedroom.  Turned in on once for about 15 minutes to learn how it works.  Turned it off and unplugged it - as I won't sleep with a space heater on during the night.  Got up the next morning and turned it on.  Within 7 minutes, flames were burning the plastic housing.  Fortunatley, I was in the room and smelled the plastic.  I removed my cat from the area and took care of the flames.  I've written to the MFG to let them know about the incident - never heard back from them.  I'm pretty sure I won't be purchasing any Holmes products in the future!  I strongly urge everyone to be cautious when using any type of space heater...may you not pay a big price for a litle warmth.

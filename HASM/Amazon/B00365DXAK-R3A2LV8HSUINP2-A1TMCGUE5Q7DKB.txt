Title: Defective unit shipped and filled with junk software
Content:
Machine shhipped with some sort of keyboard defect.  (If you have not guuessed yet, it randomly registers multiple keystrokes)
This wouldnn't be so bad except Sony technical support isnnn't there.  I called both their normal and after hours lines and they literally weren't there, they were closed.
For a flagship product line this is an unacceptable issue.

I have been a fan of zune for many years, however i do acknowledge the lead of the pack apple.  I loved the 2nd gen zune, and the intuitive touch pad.  But this takes it to a whole new level, the touch screen is very responsive, way better than the Itouch.  The software makes the back and forth of music to main menu to picture and back very quick and easy.  the gyros in it that enable the screen flip are very fast.  im glad they brought the equalizer back to the 4.0 software.  All in all, i love the new zune, and im pretty sure, it has the edge to bring any itouchian to the better side.

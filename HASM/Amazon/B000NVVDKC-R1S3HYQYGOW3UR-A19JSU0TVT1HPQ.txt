Title: Olympus  E510 is beyond my expectations, but
Content:
This is my second DSLR camera and it is a wonderful piece of photographic equipment with lots of features. I found it difficult to learn everything that one can do with this camera from just reading the instruction manual and fumbling with the controls. I have had the camera a couple of months and have just purchased the 80 minute DVD video "Jump Start Guides to Olympus Evolt E-510". After reading several email information and update letters from Olympus, I felt that I was missing camera use information. This DVD was not available from Amazon, but can be purchased at the Olympus Store. It should be supplied with purchase of the camera as it explains and instructs about features and functions that one can easily miss by just reading the instruction manual. The DVD is very well done and well worth the price. Even experienced photographers can benefit from viewing this E510 DVD.

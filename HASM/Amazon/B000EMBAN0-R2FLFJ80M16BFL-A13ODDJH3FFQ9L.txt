Title: Do not buy this vacuum
Content:
I bought this vacuum because it was compared to the Dyson, but anyone who has ever owned a Dyson knows that the Dirt Devil Reaction does not come close to the suction power of the Dyson.  This vacuum is not worth the price and constantly looses suction while vacuuming.  The bagless canister connects to the vacuum, plastic to plastic with no rubber in between to keep the suction well.  Why they don't have any rubber in between, I don't know.  Do not buy this poorly put together vacuum.

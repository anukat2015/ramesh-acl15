Title: What a dissapointment!!
Content:
The first tine I saw this coffee maker I thought this would be a great way to make two cups of coffee - One for my husband to take as he runs out the door to work and one for myself as I run out the door to take my son to the bus stop (I am a stay at home mom).  It would also prevent any wasted coffee as well as make for an easy clean up.  The design and the convenience are nice which is why I gave it my one star. However, Cuisinart recommends 3-4 tablespoons per mug, a lttle more or less depending on how you like your coffee.  Well I have never had such a bad, bitter cup of coffee in my life.  I must have made at least 8 cups of coffee adjusting the measurements each time and I never got a decent cup.  I found the taste was bitter. I packed it away and returned it to the store.  I think I will go back to my Farberware--It's a little more of an inconvenience to clean up but at least I know it makes an awsome cup.  What a dissapointment!  PS.  I'm glad I returned it before my on/off switch broke.

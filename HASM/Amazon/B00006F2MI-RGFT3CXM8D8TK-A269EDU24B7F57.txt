Title: True Coffee Lovers will appreciate this one!
Content:
I've read the reviews and made the purchase. Now I am thoroughly enjoying my hot, freshly grinded and brewed, clean tasting cup of morning Java!  Sure, the setup on the Grind & Brew is a bit more time consuming (by a minute if that once you get the hang of it).  However, if you are a true coffee enthuisiast and/or need your coffee like I do, than it's worth it!  Let's face it ... if you were used to brewing a pot of pre-ground Maxwell House and now bought this -- it's more work!  BUT ... if you love to pick your own beans/favorite coffee and took the time to grind them in a separate grinder at home --- than not only will you have the best cup of coffee waiting for you in the a.m., but the process is simplier.  If you were not regularly cleaning your grinder to begin with -- then shame on you!!! -- you were mixing old/stale grinds in with your freshly ground ones.  
This coffee maker requires that you clean and dry all the parts.  Really, you should rinse all the parts (at your leisure) and be sure the grinding accessories are dry so not to add moisture to the beans.  Save time: the other parts do not need to be perfectly dry.  And yes, I agree the water level area could have been better designed or they could have marked the inside of the thermal carafe for water levels.  That should be the worst part .. I am over it once I figured out how much water I need to put in my carafe - I like others probably make the same amount each day.
Hats off to Cuisinart!  Cheers (with coffee mug in hand) to those enjoying this morning's cup of coffee with me!

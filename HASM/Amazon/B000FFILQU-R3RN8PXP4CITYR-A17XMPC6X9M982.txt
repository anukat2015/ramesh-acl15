Title: More than just good coffee
Content:
The Bunn Coffee Brewer makes great coffee, but there is design feature that may appeal to many. The water pours into the front of the brewer.
With most counter top coffee makers, the water must be poured into the back of the machine. This means the coffee maker must be pulled away from the overhead cabinets in order to access the water reservoir.  With the Bunn, I never have to move the machine and I can keep it pushed back on the counter top. 
The brewing time is so short that you don't need a programmable timer. From the time I pour the water in until I am enjoying my first cup is only a little over 3 minutes. 
I should have bought this a long time ago.

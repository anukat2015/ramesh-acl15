Title: Cool!
Content:
Just bought this after our Amcor died after just 2 years. We have an extra room without any windows over the Garage that has central AC vents but never gets cool like the house. We took a chance with this one not knowing too much about Soleus. We were looking at a Sharp or the LG. But was at Sams and saw this one hooked up and blowing really cold air in the store and pretty quiet. So the price was right and it installed easily with the hose threw the wall to outside. It cooled down the room quicky and it's quiet enough and so far it's really cool.

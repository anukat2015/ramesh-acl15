Title: Terrific Vacuum
Content:
I purchased this vacuum after reading about it from Consumer Reports. They rated it as a best buy. I am very pleased overall. It is powerful yet lightweight. Has a convenient handle for ease if carrying up and down stairs. It has excellent suction on my carpet and of course great for my wood floors and tile. One of the best things I like is it is fairly quiet. Even my cat doesn't seem to mind it.

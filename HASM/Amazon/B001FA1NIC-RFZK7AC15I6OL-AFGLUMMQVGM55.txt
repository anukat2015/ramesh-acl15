Title: Very nice.
Content:
Cons: you MUST register with itunes for the features to work... no opt-out... and to do that you either are required to provide a credit card or a prepaid itunes card... didn't like that part at all, especially since I'd planned to start with cds we already had... why should I give you my credit card to add on some music I already own?
Cons: when you load an album with multiple singers (like duets), it doesn't link the songs together as one complete album; it separates them by artist, which makes it difficult to locate the song you actually want to hear. 
Pros: don't have to buy batteries!  Charge it on the computer while doing other things. (Takes 3 hours.)
Pros: this version doesn't have video capacity: especially great for young users that you'd like to keep out of trouble, as well as for people who really don't care for video.
Pros: TONS of memory!  16GB at the same price as the newer ones for 8GB... fantastic.
Pros: fairly intuitive set-up... you don't really HAVE to read the manual if you don't want to.
Pros: ? Has a few games on it that the kids quickly became addicted to, and I didn't know they'd be on there.

Title: Great computer for the price
Content:
There are only two things I wanted to do on my laptop: write my stories and surf the web. I didnt want a computer that allowed me to play games or do anything fancy so this computer works great for me.
I'm not much of a computer person but this is what I have noticed.
The computer is very quiet, and the screen is clear and easy to read. It comes with a 30 free trial of Norton and Microsoft Office, which I uninstalled. I got bitdefender and openoffice. So far the computer is running smoothly. The battery life runs about 2hrs unless I am typing, then it lasts longer...or I think it lasts longer. It seems to anyway, but maybe that is my imagination. Vista seems to be working fine, although I have heard of some people have problems. So far so good with me. 
The keyboard is nicely spaced. This does have a capslock, but no number pad on the side. I thought typing on a laptop keyboard would be harder for me (this is my first laptop) but it works out great.
It seems to be a fast little computer. The only hang up I have is when I go to my gmail account. For some reason it is a bit slow. I can zip around all other websites without any no problem.
Setting up the wifi was easy, which is good because like I said I know nothing about computers.
If you are looking for a computer for college or school and want something simple then I think this will work great. 
I do want to say that this computer is currently selling for 299.00 at Best Buy.

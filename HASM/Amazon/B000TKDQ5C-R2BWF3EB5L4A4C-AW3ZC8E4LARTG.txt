Title: HOT,HOT,HOT!!!!!
Content:
This little heater does the job really well. It was a replacement for another small heater used in the bathroom that had quit working. I bought this heater for my grandmother who is cold all the time especially when she bathes. We always put the heater on about an hour before she bathes so it will be warm in there. We put the heater on for the first time and about 15 minutes later she went in the bathroom and had to turn it down because is got warm in there so quickly. She is thrilled with the heater. It is compact and seems very well made. Definitely a great value for the money.

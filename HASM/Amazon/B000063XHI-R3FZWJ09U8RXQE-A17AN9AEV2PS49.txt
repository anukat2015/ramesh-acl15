Title: Time to say goodbye
Content:
We've had the Capresso 10 cup Thermal Carafe for about 18 months now.  At first I was satisfied with the coffee flavor. This was, in retrospect, a bit of wishful thinking on my part and being unwilling to admit that we had spent so much for so little. This machine just did not heat the water to a high enough temperature to extract the coffee's full flavor. And, since a carafe does not heat, this just-warm coffee could be stored for up to 4 hours. Why bother? Capresso must simply come up with a better water heating element. Also, the fill gauge is difficult to see - especially with sleepy eyes.
All in all, this Capresso model looks much better than it functions. We're very disappointed and are going back to the basics with a much simpler machine.

Title: Best vacuum I have ever used
Content:
I've owned my Wind Tunnel for a couple months now and finally decided to  write a review based on my recent experiences. I absolutely LOVE this machine for how it cleans and also for its attractive color and design. It has incredible suction and easily pulls up pet hair, grit, lint and other assorted household crud. I am always amazed at the amount of stuff I dump out of the dirt container, every week, (and I consider myself a fussbudget housekeeper...) Fantastic for carpets and area rugs. This cute little R2-D2 of a machine makes cleaning very pleasant. And I get a sort of evil delight in seeing how much dirt I can suck up and throw away! I have had NO problems of any sort and I cover 5000 square feet of house at least once a week. The wand controls take some getting used to, but work great. Cleaning out the dirt container takes a few minutes, but the system is well designed for efficiency. Consumer Reports rates this machine highest of any tested. Best vacuum I have ever owned or used.

Title: It just quit!
Content:
Ive only had this coffee maker for 7 months. I would have problems with the turn on knob. This morning it decided to not work at all. The light would come on but the water would not go through the piping. Something electrical I figure. And the help desk was not helpful. I wouldnt buy this product unless you want to waste your money...

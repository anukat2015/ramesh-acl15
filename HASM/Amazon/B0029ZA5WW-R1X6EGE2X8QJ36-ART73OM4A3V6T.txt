Title: Very bad computer, just use 4 month, now totally gone
Content:
I got this computer from birthday. I downloaded all my important files to this new computer. And donated my old computer to goodwill.
Now the computer can not start. HP service center will reformate my computer. All my files will lose. Even with losing my all files, HP sevice center told me I have waited several day to fix it. I won't buy HP computer any more.

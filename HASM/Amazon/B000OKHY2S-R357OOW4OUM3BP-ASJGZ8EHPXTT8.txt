Title: excellent customer service
Content:
Initial item received had a minor defect. This minor defect does not affect functionality at all, just some sort of manufacture defect. Customer service rep proactively contacted me and offered replacement parts and refund. I was impressed with this company's excellent service.
Besides that, this water cooler does cool down a room when room is at around high 80. the size of the room is about fitting 3 desks with plenty of walking space.

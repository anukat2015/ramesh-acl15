Title: Do not buy this coffee maker
Content:
I purchased this model 6 months ago.  It worked fine for 5 months.  At the beginning of the 6 month the clean LED light started flashing.  I followed the instructions to clean the unit, but the light kept flashing.  I called Cuisinart's service number (the quality of their service is one of the worst) and they instructed me to unplug the unit for 12 hours.  I did that and the light did not flash when I plugged it back in.  However it started flashing immediately after making the 1st pot.  I called service agin and they said they would send a replacement if I agreed to pay $10.00 and the cost to return the defective unit.  I told them no, but I would pay for the return ($4.21).  The replacement unit did not last 1 month when the clean LED light began flashing.  Once again I called service and told them I wanted my money back.  they agreed to send a replacement and pickup the the defective unit at their expense.  I use bottled drinking water, so the unit should not require cleaning for at least a year.  My old Krups went 18 months before it needed to be cleaned.
My plan it to take the brand new replacement unit back to Crate & Barrel and trade it in for a Krups.  This will be the last Cuisinart product I will purchase.

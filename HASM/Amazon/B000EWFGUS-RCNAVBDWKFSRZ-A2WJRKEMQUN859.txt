Title: Pretty Red Coffmaker
Content:
I bought this because my kitchen colors are red and yellow, the name brand and some of the reviews.  I was disappointed and returned it.  I could not get my coffee hot enough or strong enough.  I tried several times but my morning coffee is very important to me!  I bought the Quisinart and am very satisfied.  One of the reviews said the opening to fill the water is too small - I did not find this to be true.  I love everything about this.  It brews a really hot cup of coffee, requires a standard ratio of coffee to water, it is easy to progrem and it is red!

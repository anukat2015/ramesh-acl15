Title: BEST CAMERA YOU CAN UNDER $1000
Content:
i upgraded from the canon XS if you can, do it.... !!!
I don't agree when they say the XSI or the newest Canon is great I would rather have this faster 40d hell its like a mini mark II. 
Don't spend your money on the so called features of those beginner cameras just get this one or higher model like 50d some on etc. you will not be disappointed at all. Its a little heavy and big but its takes fine pictures / beautiful pics.

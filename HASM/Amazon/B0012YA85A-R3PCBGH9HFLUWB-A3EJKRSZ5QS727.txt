Title: Excellent Camera to Begin a DSLR Journey
Content:
This is my first DSLR camera and I have had it for over four months now. I've had a several years of experience with SLR's and wanted to upgrade from a point and shoot digital to a DSLR. 
This camera is every bit as good as I expected it to be. It's lightweight, takes good pictures on all kinds of lightings and the colors come out very realistic. The lens that comes with it is not the best in the world, but is good enough to get started. My only slight issue is with the camera's autofocus in low light situations, where it sometimes focuses on objects other than the main subject(s).
Overall, this is an excellent camera to begin the DSLR journey. It offers lots of controls to the user and its high ISO settings make low-light non-flash pictures come out very nice.

Title: Disapointed
Content:
At first we were delighted with the lower electric bill compared to using a traditional electric heater. The Eden Pure did do a good job of heating the room it was in, although the closer to the heater you were, the better. After about one year the unit is shutting off and has to be unplugged to reset.  It was way too much money to not give us years of use. I just read the reviews and see that others had the same problem. I am very disappointed for the amount of money that it costs and the poor quality. Not recommended!

Title: Another D70 upgrader
Content:
I upgraded from a Nikon D70 which I have been using for over 3 years. It was quite a struggle to resist upgrading to the D200 when it came out, but I didn't think the expenditure would produce a commensurate improvement in my pictures - better to spend the money on glass. With the D300 however, it looks like all my glass performs better.
The Ultimate in Nikon DX performance
Pros
- You get a D2X (better) for just over a third of the price.
- If you have been using consumer equipment like me, you just need get hold of a pro body to understand what all the fuss is about.
- Fantastic bright viewfinder in contrast to D70's tunnel vision.
- Auto-focus is almost telepathic.
- I can now control more than one speedlight from the built-in.
- That beautiful bright LCD has to be experienced first hand.
- Battery life gets even better.
- In-camera picture editing is surprisingly useful.
- Live view is something you only appreciate when you actually use it. 
- High ISO performance is excellent. Shots that would have been impossible /throwaways open up new possibilities.
- High-speed, machine-gun, rapid-fire shooting.
- Menu system, user interface is much improved - a real joy to use.
Cons
Cons? What Cons?? 
- Seriously though, I can't for the life of me figure out why Nikon (and Canon) seem to think that Pro/Semi-Pro don't deserve cheap, decent infra-red remote controls. I'm going to really miss that feature from my D70.
- This is a minor one. The feel of the shutter release button on the D70 is actually better (crisper).
I would like to say that this camera has so many settings/features you are likely to find a work-around for any perceived shortcomings. I have seen complaints about the inability to use the self-timer in Mirror lock-up mode for instance. There is a very simple work-around for this, just used interval timer shooting and you can get timed exposures in mirror lock-up mode to minimize vibrations when shooting macros. 
 
I am convinced that anything (photographic) can be achieved with this wonderful machine - you just have to learn how.

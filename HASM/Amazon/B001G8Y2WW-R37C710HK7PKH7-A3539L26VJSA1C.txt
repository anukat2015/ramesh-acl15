Title: NOT A GOOD PRODUCT
Content:
i HAD PREVIOUSLY OWNED A cAPRESSO GRIND/BREW COFFEETEAM AND HAD IT FOR 9 - 10 YEARS.  THE GRINDER GAVE UP THE GHOST, SO i THOUGHT I WOULD buy the Cuisinart, another good brand.  I hated it from the beginning.  Water got into the bean compartment and so of course into the ground coffee and the chute down to the filter and basket.  It was a mess to clean each time.  The coffee was good, but I couldn't stand the mess every morning.  I was so appreciative of Amazon's policy and procedure which made it easy to return the item.  Amazone was aalso extremely prompt in giveing me a refund of the purchase price as well as the shipping.  I'll continue to buy from Amazone from time to time as in the past.

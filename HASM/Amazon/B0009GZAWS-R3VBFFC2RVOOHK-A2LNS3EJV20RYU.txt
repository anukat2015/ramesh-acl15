Title: Best value in the market
Content:
I have had a lot of cameras in my life in a lot of formats including 4x5. All required a learning curve. When I bought the D50, I expected a steep learning curve. That is just not so. With a quick read through the operation manual, I began to take amazing digital pictures right off the bat! All controls are easy to find and easy to use. Guess work is virtually eliminated with the available Histogram. My first shot, basically right out of the box amazed even me. I tried all settings, indoor and out, and was amazed every time! The flash is a little weak beyond 25 feet, but my SB28 fits right on, and all it's functions are compatible with the D50. The only slight weakness I discovered was in the area of the white balance when photographing snow scenes. This was easily remedied by using the "Bracketing" feature. This is not my first digital camera, but it was definately the best digital camera I have owned! I love this camera!!

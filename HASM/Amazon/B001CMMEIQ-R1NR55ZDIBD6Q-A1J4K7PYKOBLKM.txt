I live in an apartment with casement windows and therefore can only use portable style air conditioners.  My first was a DeLonghi.  It was extremely expensive, EXTREMELY heavy(a swelte 108 lbs.), and although it was 13000 btus it was unable to effectlively cool my approximately 500 sq. ft. space.  In addition, it required you fill a tank with water which it used as a cooling agent to work at maximum capacity.  The tank would empty on humid days within 2 hours and require a refill to work again.  Obviously, if you wanted to keep the setting high overnight as you slept the unit did not work well.  It broke last summer, and although I live in a major city, the nearest authorized service place was an hour away by car.  After one repair, and a second breakdown right after, I had had enough.  The replacement?  This unit.  Although it is 11,500 btus, it has already done a better job cooling my apartment than the DeLonghi EVER did.  The air blows COLD.  Unlike that unit and many other larger portables, this unit requires no filling OR emptying of water, and so all you have to do is switch it on and walk away.  It has an LCD display on the remote so you can custom set the temperature, settings and fan speed.  It's a trim unit and much lighter than many.  And although someone else reviewing this product criticised the swiveling vents (which go up and down), this is actually useful in cooling the whole room, not just one area.  Sure, the majority of functions are on the remote, but the unit has a holster for it, and besides, how hard is it to keep track of a remote??  Highly recommended.

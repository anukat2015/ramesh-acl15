Title: Best camera ever.....
Content:
I was hesistant about dropping this much money on a camera...I backpack around the world a lot...and previously I had been using a Nikon D40 and a Canon HF100 Camcorder. I don't need to tell you how annoying it is to have to carry two things when you are hosteling and travelling light. I sold both on ebay...because I knew I wanted to try something different. 
After trying out the Canon T1i and the Olympus EP PEN and the Panasonic Lumix ZS3, I've decided on the GH1. This camera is amazing! I've never had an articulating LCD screen before...I don't think I can ever go back to life without one. It makes shooting so easy. One of the reasons why I sent the T1i back was because I wasn't happy with the HD video. I was beginning to think no all-in-one was going to meet my standards in terms of picture and video quality. The camcorders take crappy stills and the other DSLRs, sub $1500, took crappy, crippled or mono only video. The kit lens suits my needs perfectly...I'm just a regular person not an amateur or what not...but after buying the GH1 I think I might become one. The camera really makes it easy to get great shots and video. The Electronic View Finder is great too by the way! I don't understand where the complaints are coming from. 
Pros
Video is phenomenal! 
Excellent image quality
Kit lens seems sufficient for everyday users
Compared to SLRs this thing is small! 
Con
Not as fast as other entry DSLRs on frames per sec 
Price
At the end of the day...the GH1s strength is because it blends video and picture quality into a small portable size. If size isn't an issue for you or you don't want camcorder-type video features there are other cheaper options for you!

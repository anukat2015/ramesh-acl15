Title: Not for Amateurs
Content:
I shot my first job with the Nikon D3x..this is definitely a pro camera and for pro's going from 12 megapixels to 24.5..it will blow you away.  I am completely spoiled now.  I shot a commercial assignment  on location at Biltmore and the detail is amazing and just has a lovely quality.  Be warned though..it was a shaky start.  I was working in Photoshop CS3 and had to upgrade to CS4 with a plug in for the Nikon D3x.  So if your raw files don't open..this is why.  After that..smooth sailing.

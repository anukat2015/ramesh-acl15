Title: Great at first, but only lasted 2 years.
Content:
I bought this vacuum two years ago and here is my overall review:
PROS:
great suction
worked pretty good on my shag carpet
great on my hardwood floors
CONS:
broke down after a year (got it fixed)
broke down again after 17 more months (will not pay to fix this time)
$370 for two and a half years of use is not reasonable to me
After a year of owning the vacuum, I was vacuuming in one area and unplugged to vacuum the stairs.  Once plugged back in, I tried to turn the vacuum on.  It would not turn on.  I let it sit thinking it may have overheated.  It still did not turn on.  I let it sit overnight and tried again the next day - still nothing.  We took it to a vacuum repair shop and got it fixed.  The repairman said the motherboard was fried (I didn't realized vacuums had a motherboard).  The salesman there said "The same thing is going to happen again within the next 18 months".  I thought he was just doing his job and trying to sell me a new vacuum, but it turns out he was right on the money.  Seventeen months later, exactly the same problem - except this time I started out on the stairs and moved to the family room.  Working one minute, and very literally not working the next minute.
Now I am looking to spend more money and buy a really good vacuum.  I want one that will last 5 - 10 years, however the more I read the more I think NO vacuum will last this long.
Anyway, buy with caution.

Title: Doesn't stay on
Content:
Bought this 'cause of all the good reviews. After owning it, I've returned to look at all the bad reviews and have to agree. The heater shuts off after only a few minutes on time. I have to turn both knobs to their lowest settings and back up again to get it to turn back on. All the while the red "On" lite remains on. Can't recomend this for anyone trying to add heat to a cold room.

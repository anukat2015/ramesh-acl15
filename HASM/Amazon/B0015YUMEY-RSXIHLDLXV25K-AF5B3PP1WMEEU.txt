Title: Fantastic product, but cannot say the same for customer service.
Content:
The MBP is an absolutely wonderful product. It is fast, powerful and can even handle some mid range games you throw at it (provided you are using Boot Camp). I bought this with the intention of using Aperture 2 and Final Cut and it has served well to that purpose ever since I bought it. In that regard, this product should have received 4 stars.
Now the reason why I gave it a 4. It is my belief that merchants such as Amazon should make the shopping and deliberating process of buying an expensive item such as a laptop as easy as possible. It was easy enough to find all of the MBPs offered by Amazon, but it became quite hard to distinguish between which model offered what and which model lacked a certain feature. I even called Amazon CSR to verify to see if this was indeed the model with multi-touch and was told that it was. Of course, upon receiving the product, I realized that it was not. Too lazy to deal with returns, nor did I think it was really necessary, I just forgot about it. But the important thing to take away is that the Amazon CSR basically read off the description page and knew almost nothing of what I was asking. It might be better if I had done some more research but I was pressed for time. I recommend anyone buying similar items (ie. different models of MBP) to do additional outside research or hope that Amazon will put up a comparison feature within their web page. 
But let me be clear, this product is near perfect. Buy it if you need it. You will not regret your purchase.

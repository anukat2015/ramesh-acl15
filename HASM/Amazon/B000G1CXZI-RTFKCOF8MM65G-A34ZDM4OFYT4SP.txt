Title: Good, but quality control issues
Content:
The first unit we received made a constant loud ticking noise due to expansion and contraction. The noise could be heard clear across the house. Amazon replaced it promptly, and the new unit is basically silent apart from a slight click when the thermostat operates.
This is a neat little unit that works well to heat a small room (it's great in a bathroom), or to "top up" heating in a larger room.
Be aware that there is no simple way to override the timer if you are using the timer and you are in an "off" period. It would have been nice to have a 3-way switch - Off/Timer/On. We simply spin the timer dial around to the next "on" period, but it's easy to forget to reset it when we are done. Other units on the market have more sophisticated digital timer controls which may work better.
You must keep this heater at least 6" from a wall, and even then the wall will get quite warm. So, it's not quite as compact as you might think.
Best use for this heater is to make a bathroom warm first thing in the morning, using the timer.

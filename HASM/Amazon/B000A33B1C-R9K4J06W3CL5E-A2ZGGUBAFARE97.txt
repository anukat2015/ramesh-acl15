Title: Planned Obsolescence
Content:
This POS died in less than a year; just long enough to void out any warranty.  I used it for part of the winter of 2008, and after less than two weeks use in 2009 it no longer heats.  If you don't mind buying a new one every year, though, it heats very nicely.

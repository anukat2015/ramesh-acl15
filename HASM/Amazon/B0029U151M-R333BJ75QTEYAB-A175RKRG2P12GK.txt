Title: Not sure what happened...
Content:
Bought this computer for my daughter, as the light weight and long battery life seemed ideal, even though it was a little on the slow side.  When we got it, I noticed the speed issue right away, and the speakers were really pathetic. Two days after she had it, the keyboard and track pad just completely stopped responding.  She couldn't type anything in on the account log-in page. No one home!  We sent it back to Amazon (they were great to take it back) and we went down to Office Max and bought the same one on sale for a little less.  She didn't have it for one whole day and the same thing happened.  Don't have a clue what that's all about.  It may be a fluke, and I know there's a warranty, etc.  Just didn't make me feel real confident.  We took it back and got an HP.  Works great (and faster, too.)

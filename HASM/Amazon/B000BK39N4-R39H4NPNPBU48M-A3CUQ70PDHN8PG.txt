Title: Great Camera!
Content:
The  E500 is the 7th Olympus camera I've had the pleasure to own. Yes, I have owned a few other brands of film cameras, but I seem to have settled in with the brand that has given me rock-solid dependability, flexibility of use, and above all, the family of Zuiko lenses that always deliver high quality images. This is the first DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) camera I have owned. The build quality of the body is first rate, and fits nicely in my hand. It harkens to the days of Film SLR's (no surprise) so it was as though I had picked up my old OM-1n body. That's where the similarities end. Where the film cameras need a good deal of photographic theory to set up for each shot, The modern DSLR can be a point-and-shoot. Just set it to AUTO mode and use it as you would any $150 camera. But that's not why an ex SLR guy like myself bought the E-500. I want to be able to adjust the heck out of my shots if I want to. The differences between old and new become a little closer, but the DSLR (any brand) keeps that distance huge. Set up a tripod and take a shot like in the old days. Wait a second, and check it out on the LCD display. Need an adjustment? Make it and shoot away. Need to bracket your shot? Set it and it takes three shots in succession. It is this modern digital instantaneous adjustability that leaves the old days in sepia mode. There are just too many features for me to list with this camera, but I have been using the heck out of it for about 3 months...and lovin' it! Oh, and if you have a collection of old Zuiko lenses from your OM line of bodies, you can purchase an adapter ring for about $100 that will allow you to use them (manual focus) with the entire line of Evolt DSLR's.

Title: iPod Nano 8GB  RULES!
Content:
Pro's: Very good mp3 really worth its price is thin and easy to transport capacity is sufficient to bring video, photos and your favorite music,
is quite thin and look's like fragile but is not, it's useful to protected with a sleeve. The screen has a really good resolution and if you're a Mac user to carry your videos and tranport to quicktime format ipod, you very well respected image in general went well this generation 4 but is still unfortunate that you do not put mac radio tuner to ipod, transportation can edit text with a few notes or wordpad and also how genius is quite good.

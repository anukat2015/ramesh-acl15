Title: DeLonghi Penguin review
Content:
Works well, could use a better mechanism to connect to the window when a sliding window (side-ways)
Seems to use more Amp than specified, measured it to use 11.5A instead of the 9.7A rated.
Other than that, chills very well, no need to empty water overflow (yet) and  not too loud (not quiet either)

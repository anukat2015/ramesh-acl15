Title: Nice product
Content:
I bought this as a gift for my cousin. I expected the Sansa to be flat like a rectangle shape as per the front view but it turns out the top view is semi-circular in shape. Overall the player is good, simple and easy to handle the controls. Headphones are not that great.

Title: Don't Buy!
Content:
This product does NOT come with tools "crevice tool, upholstery tool, quick-action brush" as described.  I checked with Sanyo and they confirmed that this model does not come with them AND has no "on-board storage" as the description indicates. Very misleading and deceiving.

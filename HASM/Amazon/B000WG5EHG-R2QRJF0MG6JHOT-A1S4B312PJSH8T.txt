Title: She loved it when it worked...
Content:
I have a 30g Zune (and love it) and my wife had a 2nd gen Ipod nano. Even though she had no problems w/the ipod, I convinced her to sell and get a 16g Zune.  while she likes the Zune more than the ipod, she is very disappointed it failed after only 7 weeks of use.  The other day she went to use it and the back button would not work, then it just started acting weird and never recovered.  Tried hard boots and such, to no avail.  Disappointed in the fact that her replacement from Zune will be a refurb...after only two months of use.  Still would not buy an ipod and love the Zune software and features, just disappointed in this unit.  hopefully the next one will last longer.

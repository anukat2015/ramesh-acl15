Title: Worst coffee maker everrrr
Content:
I bought this at Target 2 weeks ago, it's so bad I logged on to Amazon to trash it.  I'm going to donate it and claim $20.  
cons:
-the carafe is stainless steel so you can't see how much coffee is in it.  
-when brewing, the coffee just falls down onto the carafe and is supposed to go into a hole on the top.  Many times it seems to overflow and fail.  Coffee all over the counter
-The clock light thing is totally unnecessary and useless. 
-When pouring the damn thing wont pour right.  You have to damn near invert it to get coffee out.  
I can't believe i wasted $40 on this piece of crap.  I'd go Braun or maybe Cuisinart.  I'll never buy a Mr Coffee (And obviously Black&Decker makes 100% junk) again.

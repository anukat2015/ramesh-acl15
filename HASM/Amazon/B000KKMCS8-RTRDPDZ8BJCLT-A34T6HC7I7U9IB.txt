Title: You can't beat this value
Content:
I bought the Pelonis because the name was recommended to me as the best. The others I had tried were plastic junk; this model is made with a metal housing. It's super quiet, efficient, and has adjustable temp setting, auto or manual, and a fan with no heat option. For the money, I am extremely pleased. The seller packed it very well and it arrived quickly. For a little heater, you can't beat this value. It kicks out the heat! I would recommend for any one to heat a small space, or a room up to 15 x 20 ft. Puts the others to shame.

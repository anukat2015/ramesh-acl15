Title: Best Laptop Ever!
Content:
This truly is the best laptop ever. 64 bit OS, 4 gigs of ram, huge hard drive, amazingly fast cpu, perfect screen size, and extremely light! Not to mention this bronze color is really nice too.  The other 2 people who reviewed this said they are returning it because they cant see the keys? Sure, the f1-f12 keys are very difficult to see.  But return this amazing laptop because its difficult to see that a function key is labeled "f1" is rediculous! As long as you know how to count and have used a computer before this is the best laptop !

Title: Excellent Bargain +++A+++
Content:
Delonghi is a very reliable brand.  The last one I had (simular to this one) lasted 5+ years.  I bought 2 more this winter to 'replace' my gas furnace.  Gas-heat is just too expensive, so I plug these in and blew out the pilot-light :)  These put out some Heat !   They are slow to warm-up, a few hours to get it going at max-heat.  They are quiet and you'll forget it's even there.  I'd say one per room during the coldest months.  I'm in Ohio and it gets pretty darn cold here.  These will keep you toasty and sleep like a baby at night.

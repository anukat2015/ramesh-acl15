Content:
My wife works in an office where the summer air conditioning is a little too cool for her.  She wanted a small, personal heat that would fit neatly under her desk and keep her feet warm, but was unable to find one in the retail stores around her office.  So, she asked me to help.  I found the lasko Ceramic Heater on Amazon and it had all the features she was looking for.  After six weeks of daily use, she's very pleased.

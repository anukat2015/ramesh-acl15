Title: Shooting Sparks **DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM***
Content:
*** UPDATE 1/6/2009 ***
DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!
I have had this vacuum for a little under 2 years now. It started breaking little pieces the day I bought it. Its very poorly made and today started SPARKING!! Sparks started shooting from the point where the cord meets the base. It almost ruined Christmas. This thing could have burned my house down if I had not reacted quickly.
Some of the other things that broke weeks after I bought it are: The dust cup, the handle does NOT stay still. The cord holder, the hose holder, the attachment holder. I called the company and they said the warranty only covers the motor. I wonder if it covers electrocution??
DO NOT BUY this vacuum!!
The original review was written in May 2007:
This vacuum has amazing suction - it picked up stuff my old hoover never even knew was there!! The "filters" do get clogged a little more often than I would like, but thats okay because that just means its picking up more junk! I really like the ability to wash the pieces and basically start over with a fresh new vacuum. Its truly amazing to see the dirt cyclone around in the dust cup like a tornado.
Now for the bad parts!!
This vacuum was made with some really cheap plastic in my opinion. Just days after using it, little pieces of plastic started breaking off of the dust cup. It didnt really harm the functionality of the vacuum until the trap door of the dust cup broke at the plastic hinges. This made it hard to create a seal and suck anything up. It just seems like the plastic on this unit isnt made for durability. 
Beware of warranty!!!
So, I called the company about the broken dust cup after less than 60 days of use to get it replaced. In my opinion, the amount of plastic that has fallen off of this unit is a manufacture defect, wouldnt you agree?? When I called to have the dust cup replaced, the CSR told me that it would cost $39.99 plus shipping. (Online its only $15!) I then told her that I just bought the unit and it came with a 2 year warranty. 
She said THE WARRANTY ONLY COVERS THE MOTOR!!! 
I was pretty mad, and I let her know that. She finally came up with "since you are such a loyal customer we will send you the replacement part for free." That was 2 months ago. I just got a post card in the mail that says something to the effect of "Due to the overwhelming response of the item you requested, it will take another 3-4 weeks to ship." I read between the lines and came up with "due to the fact that our product is junk and several hundred people have ordered the same part that broke on your vacuum, its going to take us awhile."  We will see...
Pros:
 - Great suction
 - Easy to clean
 - No filters or bags to replace
Cons: 
 - Cheap, brittle, fragile, very breakable plastic
 - Warranty only covers the motor 
Summary:
 - If you only vacuum once a year, you will get several years out of this vacuum. If you vacuum daily, you might get a couple of weeks.

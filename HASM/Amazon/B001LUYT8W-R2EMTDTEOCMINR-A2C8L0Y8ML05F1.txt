Title: most heat for the lowest cost
Content:
I have an edenpure infrared heater and I just got my iheater and the iheater puts out more heat.  The bulbs in the edenpure last about 5000 hours and the PTC ceramic heat elements in the iheater last 60,000 hours with a 1 year free factory replacement warranty.  More heat for less money.  Just my opinion.

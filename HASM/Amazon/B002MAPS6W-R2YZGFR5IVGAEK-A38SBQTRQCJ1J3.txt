Title: GREAT value!
Content:
Haven't loaded all the CDs I want on it, yet, because I'm technically challenged and need someone to help me.  The sound from the radio and CD that's loaded are AMAZING! The clip holds tight when I listen, while doing household chores, so I'm confident that it will give me NO problems staying put, when I commute to work, by train and walk.

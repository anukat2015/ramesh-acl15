Title: Every improvement I ever wanted
Content:
I had a "Cocoa Motion" machine for some time until the non-stick coating started to come off the bottom. That's unhealthy, so I trashed it. The Cocoa-Latte was a gift, then, from my wife. I thought "oh, brother, another cheesy hot cocoa maker."
Boy, was I wrong.
First, this concept is not as cheesy as it seems. It really is a convenient, less-messy way to make hot cocoa and other drinks.
Second, the Cocoa-Latte improves on every component I ever complained about with the old machine. Namely:
1. The pitcher is removable for easy cleaning.
2. The pitcher has a spigot for easier dispensing of the drink.
3. The unit can have the stirrer-only turned on while you are dispensing the drink from the spigot, so has more frothy texture.
4. If you leave the unit on, it will mix until it gets to the best temperature, then it will stop. But, if you're busy changing diapers or whatever... and your drink cools off... the unit will turn back on to mix and heat your drink until you finally get to pour it.
5. The bottom of the pitcher is not a non-stick coating that can come off and be hazardous to your health. It is "non-stick," but I think it is stainless steel or something.
There is nothing I can think of that would make this unit better.

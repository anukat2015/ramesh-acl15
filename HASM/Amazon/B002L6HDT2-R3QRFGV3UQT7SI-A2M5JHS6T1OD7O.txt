Title: WOW!!
Content:
So I upgraded from the Generation 4 Nano to this one. I love the new features. The radio is really nice because you can tag songs as you hear them so you can download them when you get home! The video  (with sound)is great quality! It even uses the microphone as a speaker! The speaker doesn't get that loud but you can still listen without headphones or another speaker. 
Worth the minimal investment! Very cool!!

Title: Good So Far
Content:
I have had this for about a month.  No problems as of yet.  It looks great, has good suction, and handles nicely.  I enjoy the power switch/slider on the handle and the length of the cord.  It's much easier to clean the stairs with this vacuum than with my previous upright vac and it's pretty lightweight compared to others I've used.  I do have to say that I kept my attachments from my old vac, thank goodness, because this one didn't have much.  The old attachments work fine with it.

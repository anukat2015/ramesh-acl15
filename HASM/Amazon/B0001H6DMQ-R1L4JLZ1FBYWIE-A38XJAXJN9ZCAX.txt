Title: Very disappointing
Content:
I purchased the Hoover S3755 based on a consumer reports blurb I found on the web. It's been horribly disappointing.  i've had the vacuum for three months and it's been nothing but a pain.  After initially doing great on my rugs (though never so wonderfully on the hardwood), now there seems to be something wrong with the motor and I'm going to have to have it fixed.  The dust canister is messy, the machine loses suction really fast.  I have a dog and it can't deal with the dog hair at all.

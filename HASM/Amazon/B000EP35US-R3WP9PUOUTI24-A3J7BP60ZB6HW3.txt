Title: Functional, fashionable, and overpriced.
Content:
The machine works as advertised, but I had underestimated the inconvenience of using a system that is incompatible with the rest of the audio world.  Apple uses its own format, which means that if you get a different computer or want to get a different brand of player you lose your music. The recipient of the gift also spends time at two parents' houses, and can only download iTunes at one and cannot synch in both.  This was solved by not putting iTunes on one of the computer and using the iPod like a flash drive (song files appear as hidden files), but it's inconvenient.  I understand they are trying to build a captive market and bow to the Gods at RIAA, but I wish there was an easier way.

Title: This will be one of the great ones!  A home run by Nikon!
Content:
Obviously, I am enamored with the Nikon D80.  As one who has extensively used the D100, D70s, and D200, I was curious as to how the D80 would "shake out" in comparison with these fine cameras.  The answer is that it does very well indeed.
The most obvious improvement in D80 over the D70s and D100 is the upgrade from 6.1 to 10.2 Megapixels--the same as its "Big Brother," the D200  This is not a major issue for many users, as a 6.1 MP image (uncropped) looks essentially exactly the same as a 10.2 MP image.  However, if the user intends to crop images in post-processing, the larger amount of resolution becomes important--the more megapixels the more detail when images are cropped.  Shooters of wildlife, for example, will appreciate the additional resolution of the D80, as it is often necessary to photograph wildlife at a distance and then crop the image to cause the subject to dominate the frame.
The other very obvious D80 improvements are the larger viewfinder and larger rear-LCD.  These are very welcome improvements, also borrowed from the D200.  The viewfinder is wide, bright, and a literal joy to use.  Combined with the 11-point autofocus system (basically the same as that of the D200 although with some differences in options) the viewfinder makes the D80 a powerhouse camera for moving subjects, or for framing the subject in places other than the center of the image.  
The autofocus is fast and sure.  I literally never use manual focus with the D80--the autofocus is just too good not to use for almost every conceivable situation.
The 2.5 inch rear LCD is bright and vivid--a joy to use.  This too, as mentioned above, is borrowed from the D200.  The menu selections in the D80 closely track those of the D200 and are largely pretty intuitive for anyone who is somewhat familiar with the Nikon system.
A few nits.  First of all, the D80 does not have a selection for focus-priority continuous focus mode.  This is unfortunate, as such an option (present on the D200) allows fast action shots using continuous-focus with surety that the subject is, in fact, in focus.  Happily, this absence (which I predict and hope Nikon will correct in a later firmware revision) is not a huge loss.  I have shot hundreds of images of fast-flying birds using continuous focus with the D80 and the images are almost all perfectly focused.  The user can trust the D80 in continuous focus mode, focus priority or no.
Nikon chose to equip the D80 with SD cards rather than CF cards.  Why Nikon did this is a mystery to many of us as the D80 clearly is an upgrade to the wonderful D70s, which uses CF cards.  Further, the D80 is a fantastic backup camera for D200 users, and the D200, of course, also uses CF cards rather than SD cards.  CF cards would have been a more logical choice in my opinion for the D80.  Fortunately, the cost of these media is dropping so fast that this is less of an issue than it would have been a few years ago.  
The D80 sucks up power a lot faster than the D70s.  That 2.5 inch LCD entails higher power use as a price.  Most users will want to own a spare battery.
As to ergonomics, the D80 is terrific!  I have just finished an 8 day stay on Maui, Hawaii, during which my D80 was literally always with me.  The weight of the camera is low, and its bulk, reasonable.  There is no digital SLR I would rather carry for an extended period than the compact D80.  The placement of the various controls is excellent, and pretty intuitive.  The quality of the D80 body construction is standard Nikon-Prosumer grade, which is to say, excellent albeit not as heavy-duty as the metal-body D200.
Overall, the D80 is destined to become one of the great Nikon cameras that will find a place with users all over the world.

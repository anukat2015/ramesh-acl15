Title: kicks butt
Content:
I've done 35mm slr photography for 30 yrs and have now used the Panasonic G1 for six months. After a lot of shooting, my assessment is that the G1 kicks butt.  I converted my old Konica Hexanon lenses to use with it, which give great image quality and less depth of field than the standard zoom lens. The standard lens itself is sharp as a tack and small. The viewfinder is amazing for one that does not use a mirror reflex system. I purchased an Olympus ultra-wide zoom that performs nicely on the G1 (with Panasonic adapter).  Auto-focus on the Olympus is excellent.  The camera is easy for a novice to use in programmed modes, but allows amazing control when shifted to manual. I had been unable to use my old manual focus Hexanon lenses due to eye deterioration, but the G1's manual focus assist, which zooms the viewfinder, enables me to focus precisely once again.
  The only negative is that certain autofocus settings/combinations can slow the camera down, but this is remedied with experimentation.  It's still not as rapid as high dollar SLRs.  The size is an amazing advantage over such cameras though, if you don't want to carry something heavy and obtrusive.
  After a lot of use, I am a big fan.

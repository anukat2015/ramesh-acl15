Title: Very satisfied!
Content:
I've only had this computer for four days, but so far I love it.  I was mildly concerned about the setup, as I replaced a laptop on a wireless network, but it was super easy.  I just followed the on screen instructions, and the computer was completely set up within half an hour. I love the big screen (upgraded from a 15 inch laptop.)  Great price from Amazon, too, with superquick delivery.

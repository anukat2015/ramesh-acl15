Title: Decent system
Content:
I've had this computer for a few days now and I really like it.  The display is very bright (actually had to turn it down at night) and clear.  Processing speed is great and the 1gb of dedicated (yes I said dedicated) graphics memory is more than I could ask for from an off the shelf computer.  ProtectSmart feature for the hard drive is a nice addition (senses if laptop is being dropped and locks the hard drive).
I just wish that it had a Blu-ray player and integrated Bluetooth that I saw on some lower priced models. See the review at [...]
So far this computer has done everything I have asked of it.  One thing of note is to make sure your programs you are going to install are 64bit compatible.  I downloaded some demo software and found out it wouldn't work.
Also this model is eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 7 if purchased between June 26, 2009 to January 31, 2010.

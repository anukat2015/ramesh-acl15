Title: XTI Failed
Content:
After two weeks and 450 pictures the camera failed. Up until failure unit was excellent- easy to use and great pictures. Failure involved total malfunction of all camera function in other than automatic. Service was prompt and polite but online database was useless in trying to resolve problem. After minute with live support was advised to return camera to service depot, which I have since done. Bought Canon XTi because previous 35mm Rebel bought in 94 had been flawless and wanted to use existing zoom lenses. Expect unit back from warranty repairs in two weeks and we will see. But leaves an uneasy feeling with me regarding reliability, plus cost of shipping for warranty.

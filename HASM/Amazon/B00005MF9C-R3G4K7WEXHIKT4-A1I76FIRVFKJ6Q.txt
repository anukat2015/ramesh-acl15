Title: A single cup coffeemaker that lets me choose my own coffee
Content:
I don't drink coffee that often and my regular coffee maker is great for company but not for just a cup.  I resisted buying the models that require you to purchase special coffee.  This maker lets me use any coffee, has a small foot print on my counter and is just what I need.  I still need to work on adjusting the amount of coffee I use so it isn't too strong.  No problems so far.

Title: Big things come in small packages!
Content:
I purchased the iPod Nano 8G to use in conjunction with the runner's tracking insole/insert originally made by Nike.  I found another company that made a similar part for any running shoe, not just Nike (sorry - no product endorsement here).  I get to keep the running shoes I love while enjoying music and track my running progress.  New York Marathon, here I come!  Just kidding, but not really.  The Nano is (to use the proper terminology) "the jump-off!"

Title: Typically good Braun coffee maker - Four and a half stars
Content:
I bought this coffee maker to replace a Braun KF180 (given to my daughter) that replaced a KF187. (The KF187 was the best coffee maker I ever owned, so I doubt if anything else will ever earn 5 stars.) I have had the KF580 for about a month and have been very pleased with it. I would rate it four-and-a-half stars, but that option is not available.
Pros:
-I like that the filter basket latches (seemed that on the KF180 and KF187 the basket occasionally would not seat properly).
-The carafe seems more sturdy than the one from the KF180/187. More comfortable handle. I was making 10-cup pots with the KF180, so I find the 10-cup carafe works just fine for my needs. I get a full 10 cups per pot when I fill the water reservoir. (My experience, obviously, differs from that of some other reviewers.) The carafe was a little persnickety at first, but I have learned how to pour it so I no longer have problems with drips.
-The coffee is HOT. Seems much hotter than with my previous Braun machines. 
-I prefer cone filters to basket-style, so this is a good feature for me.
-The style of the coffee maker is attractive.
-I have always liked the replaceable water filters. They are pricey, but I can get at least three months out of one and I believe they do make for a better tasting cup of coffee.
-Cord storage was an unexpected feature that is very nice. Being able to put extra cord into the body of the coffee maker is very handy and keeps the counter less cluttered.
Cons:
-I miss the FlavorAdjust feature. I could never figure out how it worked, but this coffee maker seems to need a bit more coffee to make the same strength pot as the KF180.
-The water indicator is a bit harder to read on this coffee maker vs. the KF180. It is easy to get used to, but I (and my aging eyes) prefer the older style with floating indicator.
-The angle of the clock and lights on the base require you to be closer to the coffee maker to see the time, or if the indicators are on or not.
Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I have had very good luck with Braun. Certainly one's feelings about coffee makers, like many things, are influenced by personal preference and some features are more important to some people than others. This one works very well for my one-pot-a-day, two-pots-on-weekends needs.

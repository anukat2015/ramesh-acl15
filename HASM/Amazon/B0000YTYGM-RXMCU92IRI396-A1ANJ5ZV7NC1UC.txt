Title: Great Product
Content:
I just bought this product and used it for the first time today.  I am very impressed.  Made great coffee and kept it hot far longer than I needed without the burn of a hot plate.
It fits nicely under the cabinets but does need to be pulled out to be filled, and turned sideways so the cover can be lifted.  A bit of a pain but not catastrophic.
I am obsessive about unplugging appliances when not in use so clearly the clock stops and displays incorrect time.  Wish it had a AA battery back up for the clock when unplugged.
The screw-on top for the carafe is too easy to misalign the threads and improperly assemble the carafe and top.  Awaremess makes it better but caution is required.  I think this is the reason for all the "coffee all over the counter complaints" a misalignment is not real obvious.
The one sacrifice for thermal intergity is the lack of quick sight as to how much coffee is left in the carafe.  Do not have any ideas on this one other than a sight gage on the carafe.
I am pleased with this product, I am happy I bought it and would reccommend it to others.

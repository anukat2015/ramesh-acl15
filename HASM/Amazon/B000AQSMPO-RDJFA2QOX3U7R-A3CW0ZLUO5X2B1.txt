Title: Every cup: hot, fresh and made with the coffee of your choice
Content:
The farther I get from my youthful days of US Navy "midwatch coffee", the more I prefer my coffee to be freshly brewed and milder in flavor.
This machine helps make that happen, and allows housemates who like stronger brews to have theirs too.
Like most people, counter space is at a premium in our kitchen. This machine has a surprisingly small footprint. Since the water reservoir lid is removable (and the entire reservoir detaches from the side), it actually needs less overhead clearance than our companion Cuisinart drip machine.
I've read other reviews mentioning issues with leaks, noise and plastic taste; we've been fortunate to encounter none of these.
A large choice of roasts and a perfect cup ready in less than a minute. What's not to like ?

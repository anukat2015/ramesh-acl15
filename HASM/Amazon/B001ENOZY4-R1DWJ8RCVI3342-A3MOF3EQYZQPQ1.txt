Title: Worth the upgrade
Content:
I have begun taking my photography more seriously and decided to upgrade from a D50. I was not disappointed. This is an excellent camera. Buttons on the outside relate to functions that I need to change without having to go through menus like on the D40. Being a Nikon user already made it really easy to begin using the camera right out of the box. More advanced features were not difficult to learn and were pretty straight forward to pick up, making it a great model to upgrade to. The kit lens is fair, nothing special but a good piece of starter glass to go with the camera. If you have other compatible lenses and don't need anything in that range, I would recommend just buying the body only.
I didn't buy this camera for the video mode and am glad I didn't. In my opinion, DSLRs should be used for stills and not try to combine video. The sound is poor and focus is manual making it quite limited. Its a nice feature to use on occasion. Even though I didn't buy it with this mode in mind these limitations prevented the D90 from getting a 5 star review.

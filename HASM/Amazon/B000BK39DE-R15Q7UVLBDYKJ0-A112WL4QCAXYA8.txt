Title: Good Value, Great Camera
Content:
Well I have had the camera for a month. The price I paid in the end for the camera and two lenses is unbeatable. I wrote paid in the end because the price dropped twice after I received it, I called Amazon and they refunded the difference. Thank You Amazon
First let me say I'm old school; I was using a totally manual camera up until now, but decided to jump on the DSLR wagon when I was using my wife's point and shoot digital camera for some candid shots. I liked being able to immediately download and have my pictures.  I'm not rich and had limited funds to make this jump. None of my old lenses are auto focus so there was nothing to tie me down to a brand name, and am not brand loyal I have owned Nikon, Pentex and if anyone remembers Practica brand names. I looked at the market and looked at cameras. There are many cameras in the price range of the E-500 and many that are way above it. In the end, dollar for dollar the Olympus won out. The automatic sensor cleaning technology is a must, and the kit lenses have been reviewed to be much better quality than other brand camera kit lenses.  And two lenses give me a jump on my new set up. [...].
The camera works great, take good pictures. I took pictures of my kids at a band concert, the school did not turn on the spot lights so there was a low light problem to face. I shot the pictures on ISO 1600 and yes there was some noise as expected but it works like it should. My hand shaking was the problem. Olympus just came out with the Evolt E510 which adds ant-shake but also cost two hundred and fifty dollars more. If I were starting the search over  I would consider  the E-510 because of the 10mp and anti-shake.

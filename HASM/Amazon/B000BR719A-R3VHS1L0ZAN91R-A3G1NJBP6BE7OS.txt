Title: Terrible
Content:
I have had two of these, and both were terrible. About a month after use, the clock area starting filling up with steam, making it impossible to read or set. Finally, after about 2 months they stopped brewing. Worst coffee maker I have ever owned. If I could give this thing 0 stars, I would.

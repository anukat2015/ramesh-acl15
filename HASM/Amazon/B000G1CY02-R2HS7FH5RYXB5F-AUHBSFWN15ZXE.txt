Title: Love this heater!
Content:
I use this heater in my medium to large sized master bedroom.  It has vaulted ceilings and is always a few degrees colder than the rest of the house in the winter.  The best thing about this heater is that it is noiseless and doesn't glow.  It heats the room quickly and has two voltage settings in addition to the heater dial.  I keep it at the lower voltage setting.  The heater is much more powerful than I need and I would cook if I kept it on the higher setting.  The lack of timer is disappointing, but not that big a deal as I plugged it into an external timer which I bought for a few dollars.

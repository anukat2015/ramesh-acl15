Title: Not What I expected!
Content:
I did a  lot of research before I bought the Bunn NHBX-W coffee pot and read all the positive reviews.  I am a bit disappointed in a coffee pot that must be in the ON position ALL THE TIME even when not in use!  In order for the pot to brew in 3 minutes, it must retain water in a reservoir at a heated state until you are ready to "make coffee". The water that you put into the pot at the time of brewing is not the water that you will be drinking at that time.  This water gets reserved and the water that you put into the pot the last time you made coffee is dispensed. SHould you turn the pot to the off position when finished brewing (as my husband did) the next time you make coffee the water that is dispensed from the reservoir is no longer hot and your coffee is brewed with that cold water-undrinkable!! YOu need to refill the pot and wait @ 15 minutes till the water is heated.  Once you have mastered that and you brew a pot of coffee, several minutes after you have drank your coffee, the pot suddenly seems to sound as if it is brewing - loudly!  This the the heating element heating up the reserved water for the NEXT time you make coffee and this noise is several minutes long.   At first I did not know what the pot was doing!!  All in all it makes an OK cup of coffee( I had better with my MR. COFFEE!)  The fact that the pot is always in the "ON" position and the pot is continuously hot to the touch makes me worry for my children.  I would like my coffee made from FRESH water not water that has, at times, sat in the pot for 2 days!! I am looking to replace asap!!

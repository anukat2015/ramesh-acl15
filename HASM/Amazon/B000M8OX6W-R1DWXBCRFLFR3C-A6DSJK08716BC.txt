Title: Functionable Laptop
Content:
I got this thing used a few years ago; now, I'm a 16 year-old, and my primary use for computers is writing, storing my photos, and gaming. This laptop is pretty decent (especially for the price) for the first two of my purposes, but for gaming, it was way, way below par. We had to buy numerous upgrades for it to even run World of Warcraft on top of my pictures (they take up a lot of memory).
BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a low-key laptop and you don't need much memory, this is a nice little piece of hardware.

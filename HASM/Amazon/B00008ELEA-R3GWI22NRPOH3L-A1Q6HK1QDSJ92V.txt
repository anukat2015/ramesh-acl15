Title: works fine, but the coffee is WEAK
Content:
I've never had a perc before, but got one after years of having to microwave the tepid coffee drip coffeemakers make.  I can't believe how weak the percolated coffee is.  I can't add any more coffee, as there is no more room in the basket.  So I will continue to search for a good, hot strong cup of coffee.  It's not going to come from this machine.

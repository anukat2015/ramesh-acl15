Title: Terrific camera
Content:
The Nikon D200 is a very solid piece of equipment.  Its weatherproof magnesium case feels sturdy and handles well.  Controls are intuitive, except maybe the AF area selector which can be confusing.  The LCD screen is large, bright and clear.  But the most important feature is the sensor and imaging software.  There Nikon excels.  Colors are accurate and can be made deliciously vivid with a menu setting.  The 10.2 megapixel resolution is more than enough for all normal use, including 300dpi prints at letter/A4 size and beyond.  The DX sensor format makes it possible to design smaller, lighter lenses such as the 18-200 VR which is a superb lens for all-round use.  The lens has a tiny amount of barrel distortion and chromatic aberration especially at the widest end but this can be easily corrected in Photoshop so it is no big deal.  Overall the Nikon D200 camera and 18-200 VR lens combination is a superb package for the high-end amateur or photography enthusiast - highly recommended.

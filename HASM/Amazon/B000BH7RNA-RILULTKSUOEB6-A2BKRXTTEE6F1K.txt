Title: Piece of Junk!
Content:
"Mr.Coffee" used to be a good name in coffee makers, but not any more. I have to wonder who designed this piece of junk. Right out of the box (brand new), a plastic seam on the back of the machine was not sealed properly and instantly leaked. My husband sealed it back together with a dab of crazy glue to save the trip back to the store... but this was just the beginning of the problems with this coffee maker. In the back of the machine where you pour the water, there are two large holes to prevent you from filling past the "12 cup" range - however, the placement of these holes makes it impossible to pour any amount of water into the back of the machine without parts of it streaming out of these holes onto your counter. The carafe itself is so oddly shaped that you can not pour coffee out of it at a normal rate- you must intentionally concentrate and pour it as slowly as possible, or it will overwhelm the odd-shaped lid and spill and drip all over the place. It's as if the carafe was designed for everything except pouring coffee out of! The "sneak-a-cup" feature, designed to stop the flow of coffee for a moment so you can grab a cup mid-brew, is a total joke. It's doesn't even work slightly - it flat out doesn't work at all. This coffee maker is hard to clean, hard to use, and brews EXTREMELY slow. It's just a piece of junk all the way around- don't waste your money.

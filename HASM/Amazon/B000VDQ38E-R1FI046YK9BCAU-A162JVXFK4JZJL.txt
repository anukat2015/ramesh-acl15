Title: Yes, it's heavy-but do you want your carpets clean or not?
Content:
I just purchased this vacuum at Target yesterday and can't believe how great of a job it does.  The amount of dirt and hair that it picked up is incredible.  I have two labs, a black and a yellow, so we have a lot of dog hair in our home.  I am a neat freak when it comes to cleaning and was amazed at how dirty my carpets actually were.  For the money, this vacuum is fantastic.  I have had an oreck for the past 5 years or so and I am constantly taking it in for repairs because of how much use it gets.  I spend an average of 120 per year repairing my oreck.  So, if I need to replace this in a year or two due to heavy use, no problem, because it is doing a much better job than any vacuum I have had for quite some time!  Love it!

Title: Agree with pros and cons
Content:
We replaced the original Cuisinart Grind and Brew with the thermal version about a year ago and happened upon these reviews while purchasing another one for my parents. To summarize our experience: Yes, there are a few rather annoying cons about this item, but the pros keep me from replacing it (and also from giving it as a gift to those who have coffee in my home).
1. It was difficult adjusting to not being able to see how much coffee was left in the pot, particularly when...
2. The coffee pours slooooowly from the lid.
3. The coffee dust is much worse on this version than any previous grinder we've had. It even gets stuck down under the part that holds the beans.
However,
1. It makes a delicious cup of coffee,
2. It looks really great (on the outside), and
3. Automatic brew and shut-off are very convenient (the coffee is still warm for me at 9:00 after my husband has it brew at 6:00).

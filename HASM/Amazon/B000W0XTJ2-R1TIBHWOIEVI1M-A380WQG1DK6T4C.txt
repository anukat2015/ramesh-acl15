Content:
I've read a lot of reviews about this machine and have read some pretty scathing remarks about the computer, the OS, the touch screen, etc.  But I have to be honest, this is probably the best machine I've ever owned.  The touch screen works great.  It was so simple to calibrate and I only had to do it once; same thing with the stylus.  If I'm just browsing the internet or typing a paper I can get 2-3 hours easily out of the battery.  Vista runs fine with no hang-ups or issues (so far).  The machine is super quiet, and the fan rarely runs full tilt.  I read a lot of complaints about heat, but even when playing games or doing demanding tasks like video publishing, I can still keep in on my lap with no pain.  Overall, this is a great computer.  The only issue I have is video graphics and processing.  Now, granted it's a tiny laptop that's not designed to play all the latest and greatest games.  And it does hold it's own, but I don't think it lives up to the 559mb video memory it claims.  When I checked the system in Vista it said I was running like 330mb or something like that with 64mb dedicated and the rest shared.  But other than that, this thing is a dream.  So when you read these reviews, take it with a grain of salt.  Some people are very upset, and some people like me absolutely love it.

Title: ehhh
Content:
I bought this as a gift for a coffee lover and it is great to take with you everywhere and make a perfect cup every time. One thing that was not good with it is that the metal top comes off and leaves glue all over the mug. Also, it tastes like metal.  The manual drip cup is excellent and holds the filter in place.  It would definitely be better if the mouth opening was plastic or a better material.

Title: It would have to talk to be better
Content:
I got this heater and had none of the problems with odors that several folks have mentioned.  It heats a 12 X 14 sunroom with no problem at all.  I cannot tell you how pleased I am with this purchase.
UPDATE:  Here I am several months later and I am still loving this thing.  Its my main heat in the sunroom and it works perfect still.  UPDATE 2 AFTER 14 MONTHS:  Cranked the thing up and its working great, I still have not suffered any odors that some other reviews mention, maybe I am lucky. Works great, if it broke today I would get another one, cheap clean heat.  Highly recommend. UPDATE 3:  Well just a note to say we made it through the Winter of 2008/2009/2010 and still working like a charm.  I can't remember ANYTHING I have bought that I felt gave me as good performance for so little money.

Title: Very Happy with my purchase
Content:
I'm a college student and I bought this after my boyfriend suggested I purchase an oil filled heater (he did the research on types and brands for me). Amazon by far has the best deal on this and free shipping! I bought it to heat my room that I rent in a house that is kept way too cold for my standards. I was so worried the heating bill would go up the first month, but it hasn't gone up where she has noticed. I turn it on for an hour at the most and I keep my door shut (sometimes, less than 20 minutes). My entire room is filled with warmth and stays that way all night. 
Please note that when you first use it (and it states this in the directions) that a funny smell occurs and will for a few uses. It does go away though. I am so happy with my purchase and can highly recommend this to heat a room. I'm not sure how it does with larger areas-I imagine fine, just would take longer to heat the area.

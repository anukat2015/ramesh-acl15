Wish I had seen these reviews before I bought this model.  Having the same problem with spilling, dripping.  This is such bad design!  Also the permanent filter is useless if you buy good finely ground coffee.  The grounds leak right through the filter giving you grit in your coffee.  Had to go to paper filters.

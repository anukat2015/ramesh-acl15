Title: B&D DCM2500 Meets My Criteria
Content:
I reviewed many coffee makers on Amazon.com. Very few met the following criteria: Less than 14 inches tall, programmable, and disposable filter.
I would have preferred one with two optimized brew settings: 2 cup and 12 cup cup. I didn't find any. We have been using the B&D for about three weeks now. It works, but the plastic is thin and cheap in appearance compared to what we are used to. I may look again at what is available, and find a place where a taller coffeemaker could sit.

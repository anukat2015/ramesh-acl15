Title: Nice package with a couple of issues
Content:
I liked this product very much on paper. when I received, it was pretty much what I expected except a couple of issues:
1. The wifi connection was getting disconnected intermittently. Calling Lenovo they advised to uninstall Lenovo's wifi software (I forgot the name!) and use the Vista's built-in one. It has not given any problem since then.
2. The sound volume is VERY low. Even with a headphone without additional volume control, it can be just enough at the top volume. I wish with a BIOS patch they will fix it.
3. It took time to understand and calibrate the running time on battery. When all of the apps closed with Outlook, one browser window/ tab (either IE or Firefox), lowest screen brightness, and in Powersave mode I am getting about 4 hrs 20 min consistently. I think that is acceptable.
4. The locations of the 2 USB ports are odd and affects your mouse handling.
5. Swapping the locations for the Function and 'Ctrl, Alt and Windows' keys is difficult to operate and prone to repeated mistake. 
I like:
1. Lenovo service. Called twice and got a real person without a maze of question answer session with automated response system. That is one reason I changed my last 12 years loyalty with HP.

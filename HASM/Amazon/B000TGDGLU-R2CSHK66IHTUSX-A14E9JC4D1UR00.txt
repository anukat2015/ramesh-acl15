Title: FALSE PREGNANCY!!
Content:
I recently purchased this heater for my dog and her up and coming puppies as it gets VERY cold here in Northern California, especially in the mornings. The heater came but the puppies didn't!
She had a false preganancy which I had never experienced with a dog, only heard about it................that was disappointing but the heater was not. I kept it anyway because our propane is very very expensive and I spend so much time in this room with my computer and tv. 
I was not disappointed there! It turned out to be a very good investment for home use and hopefully puppies next Spring.
I don't think it would be as good for a very large room but this 12x12 room it is perfect! It is so clean and easy to move around and safe for my dogs to be around.
I am VERY happy with your product and would reccomend it to anyone.
Thank you.

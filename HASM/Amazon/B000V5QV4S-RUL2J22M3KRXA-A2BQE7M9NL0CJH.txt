Title: Great camera
Content:
So far I am very happy with the camera.
I had a 20 D and I wanted to upgrade but with an upgrade that was worth it.
The camera hndles better and the outside appearance is definitely improved, larger screen, better grip and seals.
I haven't finished experimenting with all the new features but I hae already made some great pictures mostly landscape and outdoors but also low light / night pictures. I still use my original 28-135 but have ordered a new lens still to come.

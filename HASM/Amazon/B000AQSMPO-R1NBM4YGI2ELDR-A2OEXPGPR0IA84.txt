Title: Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System
Content:
Loving this brewing system, the only problem being that we're drinking too much coffee.  The ability to make regular and decaf mugs within one minute of one another (rather than brewing an entire pot of each) is fantastic.  The coffee is pretty good (not as strong as a regular pot of coffee, but many varieties from which to choose), however the pods are way too expensive.  We tried the separate filter with Starbucks coffee, but it was incredibly messy -- if you're going to use the brewing system, you really need to use the pods.
Customer service from Keurig was terrific -- during the first few uses we noticed a "plastic-like" taste.  We called customer service who walked us through easy steps to fix the problem.

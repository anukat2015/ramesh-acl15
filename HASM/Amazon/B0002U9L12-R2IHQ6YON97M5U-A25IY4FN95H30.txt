Title: Looking for a new coffee maker
Content:
I have had my Mr. Coffee thermal coffee pot for 3 years and I would not buy it again.  Why?  First, the filter does not stay in place if I don't wet the filter down before adding my coffee 9 out of 10 times I have coffee grounds in my coffee.  I have added hot water to the carafe and yes this helps but if you like to use the programmable feature of this pot you can't do this.  My most frustrating complaint is how the carafe pours.  It is impossible to poor a cup of coffee without spill a few drops of coffee on the counter.  Very annoying!  I'm currently shopping for a new coffee maker and was interested to read what others thought of this maker and if I was the only one that experienced difficulties.

Title: we are happy with it!
Content:
the cuisinart dcc-2000 works really well. one needs to make a few rounds to get the machine coated on the inside before it tastes right, but that is the case with all machines. keeps coffee warm for a long time, tasting fresh. the feature for making 4-5 cups is really useful. overall very easy to operate. easy to program, nice design. we drink a lot more coffee since we got it. the built-in water filter makes the coffee taste better.  you will need to use a pitcher to pour water into the machine, since there is no carafe. but it tells you how much water you have poured in, and how much coffee is left inside through two, easy to read gauges. one issue is that condensation water drips from the  top cover through the outer back of the machine if you open it right after a brew. there is a little crease to catch this water, but it doesn't catch it all. one improvement in a future model could be to make the crease larger (wider).  this is not a major problem if you do not open the top of the machine for a while after a brew. it also has a cool-retro-clean design. using a medium-to-fine coffee grind has worked best for my taste (instead of a medium grind as suggested by the manufacturer).

Title: Undecided....
Content:
The heater worked great - the first three weeks.  We noticed that it started turning off more quickly the second week (only heating the room for a half hour at a time) since the room was so comfortable when it shut off, we didn't think much of it.  Last week, it stopped working entirely.  We're going to give it another chance so we asked for a replacement not a refund.  I'll update in a couple of months... or the next time it breaks down, whichever comes first.

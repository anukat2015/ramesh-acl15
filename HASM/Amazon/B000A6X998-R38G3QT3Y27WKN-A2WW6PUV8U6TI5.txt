Title: Meets expectations
Content:
This heater put out an adequate amount of radiant heat.  The fan on high speed made more noise than I expected, and the amount of hot air seemed less than the fan sound suggested.  The controls were quite easy to use, and the heater maintained the ambient temperature steadily.  The unit is lightweight, but the handle in the back (not the crossbar in the front)is a bit shallow and makes the unit feel unstable, especially if warm. The crossbar gets too hot to hold comfortably, so moving a warm unit is a one-handed affair using the rear grip.

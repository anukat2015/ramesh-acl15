Title: Beautiful Blackness
Content:
The nano is definitely the way to go. I've got room for 1000 songs - who needs anymore? I just put my favorite songs on there and am up to 175 or so (as of 11/9/06). I think the black ipods look more elegant than the white ones, plus they seem to be less common. :D Which is good.:D I love the size and the simplicity of the process. Of course, it's NOT the ipod to watch movies on because the screen is so small, but even the video ipods have smaller screens. If you're gonna watch a movie, watch it on a TV. 
Everyone wishes for an everlasting battery, but this battery is not bad. Mine is relatively new, and I've heard that the battery juice goes down with age, but right now I'm very happy with the life of the battery. I don't use the ipod for hours on end - I DO have a social life.

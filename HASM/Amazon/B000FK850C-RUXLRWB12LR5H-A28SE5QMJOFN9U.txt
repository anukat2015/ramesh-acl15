Title: great product
Content:
We did alot of research on these products and have tried a few in the past, this is the best one I've ever used. Very quiet, puts out a lot of heat. Remote is very handy. This unit will heat a large space comfortably in no time and maintain the temp very well. It's got a timer, it's automatic and it oscillates. I don't have any complaints at all with this buy. If your looking for a good heater, you won't be disappointed.

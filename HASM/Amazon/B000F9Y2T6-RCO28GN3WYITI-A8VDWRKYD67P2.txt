Title: Good Product
Content:
I find this product very useful.  It cleaned my laminate floors beautifully.  I also like that you can store the fluid in the clean tank for the next use and the pads are machine washable.  The only downside I can see is it's a little difficult to push forward because of the squeegee. It does take some practice before you get the hang of it's action, but once you do, it's quick and efficient. Spray on forward stroke, return stroke is the fluid take-up.  I think a good tip to offer is to also buy extra pads as you can then switch before hitting the next room since the pad will be rather dirty from the previously washed floor. I did not use the dry vacuum as I figure it works much like an electric broom, which doesn't work in my home since I have 3 rather large, shedding dogs.  I just whipped out my Dyson and vacuumed with that first.

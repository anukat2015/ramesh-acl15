Title: Great  but slight disappointment
Content:
I moved up to this camera from my 8mp Cannon Rebel XTI. I am very pleased with all of the upgrades from the Rebel, but am slightly disappointed that I can not use live view with any of the automatic settings!! Live view was the MAIN reason for moving up. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.

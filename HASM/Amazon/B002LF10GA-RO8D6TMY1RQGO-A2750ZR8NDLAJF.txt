Title: *almost* perfect netbook
Content:
I loaded windows 7 pro x64 onto this as soon as I got it.  Installation from a USB drive was quick and easy.  Almost all the drivers needed were already included w/ 7, I only needed to update the video driver and the synaptic touchpad driver (to enable multi-touch).
Pros:
-The laptop feels very snappy with windows 7.  For general browsing, word processing, etc. it's plenty fast.
-battery life is great.  I get 6-9 hours with Wifi on and the brightness dimmed to 1/4 from the bottom.
-the size is perfect.  It's got the same footprint as a textbook and it's light and thin so I can take it everywhere.  Plus, the battery fits w/in the body of the machine so it's easy to slide into a bag.
-full size keyboard
-doesn't get very warm.  If it's running full load (i.e. flash video on the web) it will get a little warm, but overall it's much cooler than my old compaq laptop.
-the screen can get VERY bright.
-speakers are better than I expected.  They point downward, which I think is bad for sound quality, but the volume isn't that bad
Cons:
-The keyboard feels flimsy.  It's hard to feel where the keys are so I often have to look at the board before I start typing.
-the touchpad doesn't really feel or look any different than the surrounding panel.  It's hardly lowered so you can't really feel where the touchpad is.
-too glossy!  The outside is glossy so it shows fingerprints, and I not a fan of glossy screens.
-no bluetooth (though since it's european version comes with it I could probably add a module later)
While I can't call it perfect, I have no regrets about getting this laptop.  I think it is the best option as of now.

Title: Every time you use them there is a problem
Content:
I have 9 of these permently installed around my pool and since new there is always 1 or 2 having a problem.  I have had a service tech out many times onsite and they get fixed temporaily till the next problem arises.  Funny thing is my 2 propane DCS heaters I bought years prior have no problems.  I would not buy another SunGlo product ever.

Title: Excellent suction power but messy bagless clean up.
Content:
I am most impressed with the suction power on this vacuum. It picks up all the long hairs embedded in my super thick carpet. It also rolls easily by itself so that cleaning can be done quite effortlessly. Like everyone said previously, the clean-up is messy. You do have to use a stick to scrape out the filter afterward. One complain is that the vacuum doesn't come with more useful attachments such as a narrow noozle for cleaning corners and cracks. Also, although the canister has two wheels, it doesn't really &quot;follow&quot; well as you vacuum on thick carpets. If you hate the fact that you have to clean the vacuum after you clean, stay away from bagless.

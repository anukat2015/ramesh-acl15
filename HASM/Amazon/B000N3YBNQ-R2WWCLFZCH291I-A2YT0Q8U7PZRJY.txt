Title: Best Vacuum I ever owned
Content:
The Electrolux Intensity upright- excellent design, suction, and storage.
I love the fact that it is so simple in design without all of the hoses and attachments.
All I ever did with the hoses and attachments on my old Hoover was trip over them, Struggle with them, and curse at them when they fell all over the place. 
As for the small bag, larger bags just reduce suction. Also, the dirt inside larger bags just collects, then the dirt begins to stink and whenever you turn on the vac it smells.
Small bag is the way to go.
Excellent product, you wont be disappointed.

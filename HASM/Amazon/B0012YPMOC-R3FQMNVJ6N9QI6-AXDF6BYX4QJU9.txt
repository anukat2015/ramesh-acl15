Title: Does not have video out!
Content:
This is a great little MP3 player and FM radio.  It does everything that it says it does.  Unfortunately, it doesn't say that it is missing video out capabilities.  That means you are totally stuck watching videos on the 2.5 in screen.
I bought the Zen because Itunes and NBC were squabbling over pricing and Itunes no longer carries shows like "Heroes".  I like to download these shows to my IPOD and play them through my TV.  Works very nice - DVD quality, wide screen, etc..  
So, I decided to buy the ZEN 4 gb on Amazon so that I could download Heroes via Unbox.  I even went out and spent another $20 on a video out cable before realizing that the ZEN did not have video out capabilities . . . had to google the heck out of it, before I discovered that.  I spent a bit of time trying to figure out why it wouldn't work first.
I still give it 3 stars because it is a great little MP3 player and the FM works very good too.  I also like the fact that it will synch to Outlook, but I haven't tried that yet.
But, if you want a player that will play videos out to you TV, look elsewhere.

Title: Yes, it can in fact play protected Ipod video & music...
Content:
For those who whine about the new Zune not being capable with playing Ipod Videos & Music need to do some better research. As is true of most generalized players, they intentionally format their videos and music files to be compatible with their own payers, duh, makes sense, why share with everyone, who would buy their songs and videos then?! However, there are plenty programs out there now that can and will flawlessly convert MV4 or other DRM video and mp3's to any compatible format for what ever player you own...including the Zune, and yes, it is all 100% legal if used for your own enjoyment, not to sell around. The best converter for this on the web, in my opinion, is TUNE Bite's Platinum converting program. It cost about $35 but you will ALWAYS be able to convert Itune M4V videos into WMV format to play on your ZUNE. I have done it, and you know what...it's WAY better looking than watching it on the Ipod, because the ZUNE has a bigger wide screen! This program works as well for formatting ANY protected MP3 format too. This program also works vise versa for converting WMV into M4V if you want to convert to watch on your Ipod...but please, don't knock a player by saying it "doesn't" play Ipod this or Ipod that, it does, you just need to know where to go and how to do it! I give the ZUNE 5 stars, regardless of what some people think, it's not as limited as perceived. In fact, once you get past the Video conversion thing, it has way more features than the Ipod, I know, cause I owned one...

Title: Great budget laptop
Content:
Pros:
This is a very, very good computer for the price.  I bought mine factory direct and added a dual core processor, and the performance is great.  It is relatively light.  The hard disk transfer speed is as good as my older desktop which is a higher RPM drive.  It has a discrete nvidia graphics card (256mb) a separate key pad.  It has a very nice, big, widescreen.  And I got all this for less than $400!!!  Can't be beat.  
Cons:
Look at buying an upgraded battery.  Glossy cover and touch pad collect enough fingerprints to convict you in any court.  :)  Slightly bendy design.

Title: Good choice
Content:
I bought this vacuum about three months ago after searching online for  other brand. I had canister vacuum for many years but it was broken. I like a similar vacuum because it is easier on the stais and good on hardwood floor. Panasonic has a good reputation on quality and design, so I bought without hesitation. So far the vacuum works well and light in weight. The only problem is that eighter the cord is not retracted back into the storage, or it does not stay out. I had to use a binder clip to stop the cord going back in. Also, it is very hard to find the replacement vacuum bag. Had to go to panasonic.com to order them.

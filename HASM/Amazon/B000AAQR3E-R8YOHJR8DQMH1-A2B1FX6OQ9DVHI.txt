Title: Greatest vacuum ever
Content:
This vacuum has all the features one really needs to keep house & car clean. From a long enough cable over adjustable power (while operating at a very low noise level - even at the highest power setting you can talk on the phone) to smart little things like a holder for hose and tools on the side of the vacuum. So when you stand it upright you just hook the hose into it and it sort of becomes one unit, such avoiding clutter when storing it.
This vacuum seems to suck out all the dirt from anything you put it on. I don't have pets so can't make a call w.r.t. pet hair (pls see other reviews for this), but my house is cleaner than ever before -- I have a mix of carpet, linoleum and hardwood floors. I haven't had a need for the rotating brush yet, as even w/o it the carpets gets clean. The brushes are very flexible and easy to navigate as well. And you can easily vacuum below bed, couch etc., where no Dyson etc. would take you.

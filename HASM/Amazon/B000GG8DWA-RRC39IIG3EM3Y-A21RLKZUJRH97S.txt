Title: quit after two months... where I can I return this junk?
Content:
Thought it was good at first, but today, while on, it just stopped working. I've tried it in other outlets, checked everything. It's just dead and that's bad because I live in a motorhome in mountains with snow and it's cold outside. Plus, it's a 2-hr. drive to the nearest store... one way.
To whom and where do I return this junk? Amazon won't take it after a month and I no longer have a box with info about it. I thought it was a great deal, but I guess you get what you pay for. I only bought it for the lower wattage use for my small space.

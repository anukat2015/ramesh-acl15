Title: IT SUCKS, BUT THAT'S A GOOD THING.... :)
Content:
Ok, after much deliberation, I bought the Dyson canister for the sheer selling point that it was a canister and it was made by Dyson.  I won't lie, I have waited for the Dyson canister to be released here in the States since they started marketing the DC07.  I really liked the idea of a bagless canister with no filters to buy.  My family is very health conscious and we try to do our part for the environment.  Upon inspection of the unit after removing it from the box, I noticed that the HEPA filter was of great quality and the bactisafe screen just looked cool.  I plugged it in and kicked it on and much to my surprise it had as much suction, if not more, than the Animal upright.  The downside to the DC11 is the fact that its turbobrush is air-turbine powered and tends to slow down or stop a lot on medium to high pile carpets.  Our house is one of theose strange creatures with high pile, medium pile, tile, wood, and even cork.  So, I tested the vacuum on all the floors and found it worked great on everything except carpet.  There it seemed to be lacking.  I tested it for about a week and then was forced to return it for an Animal upright.   After vacuuming with the DC11 and then going over the same areas of carpet with a Eureka canister with powered brush, I found the Eureka was removing almost as much dirt and from the carpet as the Dyson originally did.  There is just not enough agitation in the brush to work great on carpet. Final verdict, great for floor, may need some compromise for carpets.

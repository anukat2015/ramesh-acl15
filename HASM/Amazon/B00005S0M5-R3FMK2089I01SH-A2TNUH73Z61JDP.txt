Title: A Must Have for any firewire user.
Content:
Light weight. Versatile. It's a hardrive you can carry with you all the time. I work from different location and this little gadget is a blessing. Transfer files back and forth in seconds. With xPod you can use it with any PC. You just need a firewire card. You can also hook it up in your car with an adapter and you won't need any lame cd/md-changers. The price is a little steep but so far there's nothing out there you can compare with it. If you want something that's both sleek and practical, this is it.

Title: Absolute Heaven
Content:
With the exception of the lack of a full 35mm frame CMOS sensor, this camera is absolutely perfect. The images are wonderful, the camera functions quickly, and a serious photographer will be delighted in the control they have over the operation of the camera. It works very well for a quality obsessed amatuer like myself. Worth every penny. This is my first digital SLR, my film SLR is a low end Canon Rebel. This is the first digital camera that doesn't make we want to go back to film due to slow responses and poor image quality. Happy Happy Joy Joy.The smaller than full frame sensor changes the lenses you might use, if you plan on re-using lenses you should do some research to understand how it will affect them. I got a 28-105mm Canon USM and I'm very happy with it.

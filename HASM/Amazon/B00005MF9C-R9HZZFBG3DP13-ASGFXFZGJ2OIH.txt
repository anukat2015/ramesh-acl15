Title: Not just for the Starbucks types
Content:
I bought this for my Grandmother, who lives in an Assisted Living community that apparently has really poor coffee. It is simple for her to use and makes the equivalent of a couple cups of coffee. She can make her usual rounds socializing with her buddies and take the cup along. It is easy to clean up in her small kitchenette sink and doesn't take up much space. So, consider this as a gift to someone who maybe doesn't need a travel mug so much as just a nice, easy way to get their morning coffee without a lot of trouble.

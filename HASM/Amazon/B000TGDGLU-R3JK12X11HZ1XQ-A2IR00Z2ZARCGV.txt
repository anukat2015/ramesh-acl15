Title: DeLonghi EW7707CM Oil-filled Radiator Heater
Content:
Read all the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  Rejected the DeLonghi radiator with timer b/c of noise concerns.  Been using this DeLonghi non-timer radiator for three weeks now to heat my 20 x 12 bedroom while our furnace is out for a remodel.  Room has average insulation. Overnight temps have been in the low 40's. Results have been very satisfying. Room heats to a very comfortable temperature on highest power in about 15 minutes and maintains temperature at half power. Get this heater if you want a constant source of heat, not for instant space heating.  Issue with the smell of the hot oil is trivial unless you are especially sensitive to smells.

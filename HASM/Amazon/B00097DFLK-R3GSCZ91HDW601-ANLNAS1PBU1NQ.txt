Title: Save your  money
Content:
I bought this sytem thinking it would at least provide some comfort from the Southern Cal heatwave we got durring the summer of 2006. Bottom line, IT DID NOT. The square footage of the top floor of our apartment is approximately 500 square feet. The largest temperature drop was from 91 degreees to 89 degrees at 9:00PM. Even sitting directly in front of the system's fan (approx 10 feet away) did little to cool one person, so forget about cooling a small room. Please look elsewhere if you want a room larger than a small closet cooled.

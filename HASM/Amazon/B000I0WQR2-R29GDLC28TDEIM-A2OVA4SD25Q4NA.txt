Title: Amazing heater
Content:
My heating bill for a 1 bedroom apartment was $250/month last year - and I was only keeping it at 65F when I was home (57 while away).  Anyway I searched on craigslist for heaters and ended up getting this one for free.  It has been amazing - it kept my badly insulated room very warm (had to turn it down eventually) all throughout last winter. My heating bill dropped to $100-150 a month but my electric bill went up by only ~$30 - it's super efficient.  I'm in the process of buying one for my living room - I'm hoping to use these two heaters exclusively for this winter.

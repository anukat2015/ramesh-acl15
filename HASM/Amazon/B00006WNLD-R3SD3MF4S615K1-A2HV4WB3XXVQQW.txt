Title: Horrible Plastic Taste
Content:
I am VERY disappointed in this coffee machine. I drink just about any coffee, BUT this has the most awful, plastic taste, and I tried everything, running it alot, filtered water, vinegar, and it is awful. I wish I could get my money back. Maybe I just wound up with  bad one, but BEWARE!

Title: Good things DO come in small packages!!
Content:
I just picked this up in December and have not put it down since!  What a terrific product Samsung has put out for us music/gadget fanatics! This little guy is impressive to look at with a very robust and colorful screen, the menus are easy to navigate through and it is user-friendly all the way around.  I was torn between this and the iPod Nano but I'm very happy with my selection thus far especially since it offers the option of an FM tuner which you can record from directly into the unit!  I bought a rubberized cover for it which I highly recommend to keep it clean, prevents slipping when you put it on a surface and protects against scratching the outer casing.  Other owners have dinged the earbuds on this but I don't have any complaints except that they fall out from time to time (as with any earbud) so I'll most likely upgrade to BOSE noise-cancelling earphones. The sound on this unit is EXCELLENT as it has surround sound capabilities and different settings to choose from.  In addition to my 1GB unit, I purchased two 512MB units as Christmas gifts so that should tell you something about my level of satisfaction.  I also purchased a two year replacement contract since as with any portable device, the risk of damage is greater.  If I could put something on a wish list it would be that Samsung include a case and neckstrap with the unit as mine did not come with those items.  Definitely one of the better mp3 units I've seen out there!

Title: Does what it is supposed to do, quietly & efficiently
Content:
We have only had the Delonghi TRD0715T a few weeks but so far it does its job quietly and efficiently and we are very happy with it. It should be understood that it will only warm a small area and that its heat goes up for the most part. We use it in our bathroom near the shower, programmed to come on about a half hour before we are most likely to shower and to go off about an hour and a half later. I have not heard any ticking sound from the timer.

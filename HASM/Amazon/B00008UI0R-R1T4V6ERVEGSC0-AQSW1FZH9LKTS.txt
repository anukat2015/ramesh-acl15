Title: Best vaccum ever!!!! I've owned two!!!
Content:
I bought this vaccum two years ago from Best Buy for $400,after much research and consideration. It is the only vaccum I've had that can clean every room and under beds with out alot of heartache. It is so powerful it will suck toys and clothes out from under beds, and pick up dog food with no problem. I LOVE it! A piece broke on one of my attachments, and Best Buy made me bring in the whole vaccum to do the repair. They said it cost to much to fix and assumed I'd take a store credit or trade. They then proceeded to throw my vaccum away without asking me if I wanted to do an exchange. Anyways, they carried nothing close to comparable to my vaccum, and so they ended up giving me a full refund, so I could buy another one. I bought this one two weeks ago and it is identicle to the other. I STILL LOVE IT!!!!!

Title: Good buy
Content:
This computer is excellent for average daily computer usage. Screen is very bright, very good resolution and an excellent size for travel. Good battery life. My only con is that this laptop cannot handle powerful gaming (crisis, half-life, flight sim etc.. Overall very good laptop for your money.

Title: Dirt Devil Vision Turbo - Worst Machine
Content:
This is the worst vaccuum I've ever owned or used.  Almost no suction at all on area rugs (I could use a hand broom and get better results!).  It tends to tip over when turning.  The "on-board" tools pop off everytime the wand goes under a chair. The only plus is the light weight.  I am amazed that anyone would put their name on a product this ineffective and badly designed.

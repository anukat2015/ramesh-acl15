Title: Great, light-weight, powerful machine for daily use.
Content:
I bought the U505-2008 model. Seems to be similar to the one described. I love it. Have it had it for about a month. The only negative is the short battery life, but when you look at the lightweight portables with longer battery life (e.g., HP, Dell), their batteries are twice as heavy. I wanted a lightweight laptop above the netbook size for everyday use that was fast. This is it. The screen is bright, it is fast, easy to set up, 500 GB HD, 4MB, i3 intel core. Is it perfect? No, but for the price and the features, as well as the weight, I couldn't find much better. Also, Toshiba has reputation for being durable. I took it on a recent trip to Spain, used local outlets, had no problems with it, works like a dream, especially compared to the clunky Dell Latitude I was using before.

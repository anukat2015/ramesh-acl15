Title: Worth every penny!
Content:
I have been looking at getting a laptop (or maybe netbook) for a while, keeping an eye on specs and prices. For this price point, this was the best deal I was able to find. I've only had it like 4 days but it feels like weeks. I keep finding neat new features I would have never expected. Very happy with this laptop, well worth every penny.
My favorite specs are:
- much longer battery life than most any other laptop i was able to find under $600
- great amount of storage/memory
- can put my camera chip directly into computer on the side, w/o having to dig out the usb cable
- happy/confident with the brand, that it will last a long time
...have yet to use the dvd burner, but soon, very glad it does have dvd burner as my last computer didn't
- watched a handful of tv shows and movies, very good screen quality
- the video conferencing you can do with the cam/mic has lots of fun features, also good quality
and best of all.. i had it in my hands in less than 24 hours after i ordered it using the amazon prime next day delivery, $3.99 for shipping and no tax was what put it over the top for me. I guess the only thing i didn't like was that it doesn't come with Microsoft Office, but i deleted the program it came with and put it on there anyway, so didn't effect me.(Don't think I've seen one that comes preloaded with it w/o having to pay extra anyway.) Customer reviews were very helpful to me in my search so just wanted to return the favor, thanks, and good luck in your search!

Title: Dirt Devil Cruz
Content:
When I first got this vacuum, it seemed to work great.  But the more I use it, the more disappointed I am with it.  It doesn't have much power, and I have to empty the dirt container every time I vacuum, and sometimes more than once during. And I only use it for touch up cleaning.  It is a sleek looking vacuum, I just wish it had more power.

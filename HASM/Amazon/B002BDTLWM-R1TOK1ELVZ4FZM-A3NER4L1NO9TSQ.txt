Title: What's to not like ?
Content:
To start with, I am a believer in use a product for it's intended purpose.
And this media player does it's job VERY well.
Listen to music on a phone? No thanks.
Use a laptop or net book to play an audio book? Also, no thanks.
BUT when I want to listen to MY music or audio books ,,,,,,,
This thing is GREAT !
Revue or show photos from my cam.
Listen to something  different while I'm on the road or in the air.
It's no big deal ,just swap the card out. (cheap SD)
No kidding, If you want a small media player that runs all day on a charge, this is worth looking into.
Extra cost,  Screen protectors
             Case 
             And clip over the ear headphones

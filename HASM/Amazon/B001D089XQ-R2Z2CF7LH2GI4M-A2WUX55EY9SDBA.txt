Title: Archos 7 internet media tablet worse than archos 605
Content:
I was so excited to get the Archos 7 as I have loved my Archos 605 wifi however I am getting older and the screen is way to small even on zoom mode.
In comes Archos 7..gorgeous device..large screen amazingly readable internet pages.  Incredible battery life at least 4 hours.
Internet radio is rad.
Downside. I can hardly view any you tube videos without that wretched adobe flash 9 error .jpg.
Tech support really doesn't care that I can't view these or that all the videos I transfered from my old archos are all out of sych with audio/video.
Overall a very pretty toy but far less functional than they describe.
Not to mention you have to shell out $20 everytime you want to use a different file format like mpgs and video pod casts.

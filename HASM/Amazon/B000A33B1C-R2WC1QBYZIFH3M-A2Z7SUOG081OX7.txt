Title: Nice value - but offgasses too much
Content:
I've had an old Delonghi oil-filled space heater for 15 years or more. It had a recall on the control panel. The last few years it has been leaking oil on high setting. So I searched and decided on the newest version of the old Delonghi. 
This is a good product with easy control and a clever timer feature (took me a while to figure out, though - NOT obvious, and I'm reasonably bright and handy!).
Only complaint, and it is fairly serious: when new, it stinks when run on high setting, which is only 1500 watts, after all. 
There was a paper in the packing that said to expect some off-gassing at first. Well, I've run the thing for 5 days on high heat and it still smells toxic when running on high heat. The paint finish gives off some sort of fumes for days and days. I still cannot stand to run it on the high setting indoors at all. It really smells bad - like curing oil-based paint. 
It really stinks! I've been running it in the basement and it still is not nearly acceptable for indoor use.
I trust I will eventually be able to use it in an actual room. I'll give it five more days of blasting away. I may have to send it back. It is pretty heavy, though; I'd lose a lot of money on the deal from shipping costs.

Title: Excellent heater - after 4 years, definitely worth the money
Content:
I've had this heater for four years and I'm absolutely happy with it and recommend it to everyone looking for a reliable, quiet and efficient space heater.  For the $50 I spent on it it's hands down the best heater I've ever bought.  For the price it has a decent fan to push the heat into the room and has great features like occilation, temp settings, and/or a timer feature.  It even comes with a remote and a clever little holster for it that clips to the back.  Bravo.

Title: Great value for the features
Content:
I bought this item for my cousin, who wanted an inexpensive laptop with a wireless network adapter to connect to the Internet from anywhere in his home. I set up the Vista operating system for him, and took a good look at the laptop's features in the process. There's a lot of plastic in the construction, so it's not the most durable design compared to more pricey laptops, but overall it's a fair tradeoff for the price paid. 
     I would certainly recommend this item to anyone looking for a decent quality laptop with all the essential bells and whistles, and a Great price at $329 shipped. The 15.6" screen is quite nice, more of a rectangular format than square, but still roomy for displaying multiple windows. With a 1 year warranty from Acer, it was money well spent. I even thought of keeping it for myself after taking it out of the box and viewing it for the first time, and I'm a very discerning computer technician! If the price is still the same, BUY IT, just don't drop it, and use an external keyboard when you can because the laptop's keyboard is very light to the touch and may not be what your fingers are used to. 4 stars for the bang for the buck and the features package...

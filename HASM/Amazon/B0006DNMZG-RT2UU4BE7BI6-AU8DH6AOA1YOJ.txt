Title: weak heater
Content:
With the door closed in a small area (bedroom), the unit struggled to produce any measurable benefit.  The unit was heating air, but heat was rising straight up from the unit.  After a cold night we returned it and purchased an electric blanket and a quartz heater which we love.  
On the plus side, this unit is overbuilt for safety.  The elements are encased in a mesh grill, and the unit will turn off if tipped over.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't produce as much heat as I wanted.

Title: Bionaire Heater is Suberb
Content:
I bought this heater 3 years ago after seeing how effective it was at a friends house, (and efficient too). And I just ordered 2 more for our larger dwelling. (The old model was Bionaire BCH3220; the new model is BCH3225-U, just a minor change in remote control design). This ceramic heater is the only cermaic heater I could find with a fan for improved heating from a small distance away. The Remote Control Thermostat is great as well. Just set the temperture you desire, and kick back for a safe good night's sleep. Better than any other space heater in the market, and practical to use for saving on heating and electric bills. (Has 1000 and 1500 Watt settings). This year, all "brick and mortar" stores were all out of this model, with no re-order date in site. But it's so good it was well worth the time spent searching the Web to find it, and then setting up an account on Amazon. $40 sale price tag at Amazon - best deal anywhere for the money. Also sold by "DealYard", Amazon's supplier, but at a higher price when buying direct - (go figure?) Bionaire makes other models, but I would only recommend this unit, the BCH3225-U - Highest Recommendation, (from a very critical consumer) - the best out there, you won't ever regret this purchase!

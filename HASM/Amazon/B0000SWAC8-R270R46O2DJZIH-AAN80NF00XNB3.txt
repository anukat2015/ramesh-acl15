Title: Electrolux Oxygen Vacuum
Content:
Exceptional vacuum cleaner, very compact and powerful.  The idea vacuum to have in a household with three large dogs including one very hairy golden retriever.  Electrolux has always been known for a quality prodcut and with the list price at Amazon.com it made it a very good value.  Only draw back is that the bags are small but usually in other vacuums once the bags were approximately half filled a power reduction was noted, in this vacuum it is not the case.  The compact size allows for easy operation.

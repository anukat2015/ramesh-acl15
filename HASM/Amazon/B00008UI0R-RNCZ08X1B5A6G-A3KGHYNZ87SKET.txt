Title: finally a vacuum that works!
Content:
Easy to use, lightweight, and switches on the handle make this vacuum really user friendly.  The canister has to be emptied out quite frequently in the beginning, but as your rugs get cleaner - the less you will have to empty it.  Great for going from hardwood floors to area rugs and it has a suction control so that you can make the suction stronger or weaker depending on the type of rug.  This is nice when you have to vacuum really small bathroom or kitchen area rugs because it does not suck up the whole rug.  Recommend this highly to anyone who has gone through a bunch of different vacuums....

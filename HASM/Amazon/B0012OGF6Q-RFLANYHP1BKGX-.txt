Title: I love this Camera!!
Content:
This is my first Nikon DSLR camera and I love it!!!  I bought my camera at Kits Camera in the Mall on Black Friday.  The package deal that I got with the Nikon D60 that I bought at Kits Camera comes with a Nikon Camera Bag, 2 Nikon DVD's for beginners, Nikon AF-S DX VR Zoom-NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G, Nikon AF-S DX VR Zoom-NIKKOR 55-200mm f/4-5.6G IF-ED, Digital Picture frame, 10 free camera classes for beginners and free prints. I spent $750.00 for the package.  Great Deal for a starters kit!! 
I highly recommend the Nikon D60 Camera for first time DSLR users.

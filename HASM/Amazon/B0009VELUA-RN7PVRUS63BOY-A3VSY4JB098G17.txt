Title: I love it, but . . .
Content:
I bought this as a replacement for my first Coffee-on-Demand, which, alas, died rather suddenly.  
That sudden death, by the way, was something of a glitch throughout the product line, or so I was led to understand.  My sister, who introduced me to the product, bought a completely different coffeemaker when hers died.
Call me a glutton for punishment, but I loved mine.  Easy to clean; easy to make coffee; small counter footprint (more or less), and pain free.  
Well, until the morning I put the last of my Peet's Major Dickason's blend into the basket, filled it with water, and nothing happened.  That was Thanksgiving morning!  AAAAARGH!
Anyway, there was a kind of shipping glitch, so instead of getting it Saturday I have to wait, but given that my coffeemaker lasted two years and served up delicious coffee with no pain for two years, I will be okay.  I gave it four stars only because of the possibility of Sudden Death.

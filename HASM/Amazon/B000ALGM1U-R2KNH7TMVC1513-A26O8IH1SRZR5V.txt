Title: Easy to Install, Program, Save
Content:
I received this thermostat. Installed it in 15 minutes with the help of my 11-year old (holding a flashlight for me). It's very easy to program and has nice features like instant override if you enter the zone and want the temperature higher or lower. It also has the light when you touch it, but when you don't it's not glowing annoyingly. KB

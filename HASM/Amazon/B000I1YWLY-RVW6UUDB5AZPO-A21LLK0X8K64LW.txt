Title: Tired of tracking down vacuum bags?
Content:
This bagless wonder has it all.  It fits in a small hall closet where my smelly old bagged vacuum used to reside.  It pulls stuff out of my carpets I never guessed was there.  It does not emit those stale, musty, dusty odors all my other vacuums did.  If I need less suction for more delicate cleaning (lamp shades or draperies) I just power down.  It has amazing cleaning range.  And did I mention this vacuum has personality and flair?  It's bright orange and smoky gray and is angled in a cleaning posture!

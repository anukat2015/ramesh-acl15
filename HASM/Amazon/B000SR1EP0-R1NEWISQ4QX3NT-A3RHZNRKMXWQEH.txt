Title: New Air Portable A/C
Content:
This portable a/c unit appears to be a good value for the money. The operating manual is rather skimpy and there does not appear to be a separate control for the ionizer function, which remains on continuously. Delivery was a problem. There was delivery damage on the first unit that I received, and response from New Air to reship was slow. The second unit received was also damaged (I do not know if either unit left the warehouse damaged or if FEDEX was to blame.) The third unit arrived in good condition more than a month after I placed the initial order.

Title: Great Learning Tool
Content:
I have only been using this for two weeks. When I first received it as a gift, I thought I didn't need it, because I have other MP3 players. Now I cannot stop using it. I find it a great and convenient tool for checking e-mails, weather and news when have access to wireless connection. I have downloaded free games, apps to prepare for the GMAT test, different language dictionaries (English, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese), Spanish learning Podcasts and videos etc. With the iPod Touch, I find myself have access to a more diverse way of learning and learning has become more enjoyable. The only problems I have so far are: the speaker quality is not too good; not loud enough. Also, you are restricted in using iTunes to transfer files to the iPod and cannot transfer files directly. Honestly speaking, if there are technical problems with the iPod or if the battery needs to be replaced, I would not know where to get help because there's no user manual or Technical contact info. Let's hope it will last a long time.

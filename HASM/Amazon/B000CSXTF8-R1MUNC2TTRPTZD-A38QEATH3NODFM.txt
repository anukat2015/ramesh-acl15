Title: So far, a great unit, with a remote
Content:
Before I got this unit, I had never seen an air conditioner with a remote controll. Now I am noting that many units due that are haier brand. So far, this unit is doing great, works good in about a maximum of 500 SQ ft, prefered around 350-400 sq ft.  110v plug-in makes it easier to place in the house without having to hook up a 220v outlet.  Quiet as well.  I'll have to see about the durability, but I have a Haier dehumidifyer that I am pleased with.  Check this one out. Available here on amazon, or check at many major retailers as well.

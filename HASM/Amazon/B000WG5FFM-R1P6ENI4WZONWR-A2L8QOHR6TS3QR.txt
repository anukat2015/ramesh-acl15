Title: Great Player
Content:
I waited & waited & waited......my trusty 250 MB Intel Pocket Concert Audio(original MP3player)was long overdue for upgrade.  This device/software work wonderfully.  THe audio quality is excellent.  I am totally thrilled, now I can go for weeks of workouts whereas before I downloaded every other workout.  One annoyance is the fact that if you play a song, when you cut the player off it start from the beginning, this is a real bummer and hopefully new software will correct.  You will definitely need to invest in a case.

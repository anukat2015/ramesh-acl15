Title: Sending it back.
Content:
This is a nice vacuum.  I bought it because of the dirt devil name, but I bought it for cleaning my house which is 90% carpet. The attachment for carpet cleaning (called turbo floor cleaner) is terrible.  I have a longer fiber carpet but this attachment grabs hold of the carpet on a forward push and literally is useless for carpet that I and probably many others have.  I really needed this to work on my rugs too so I'm discouraged at having to send it back.  Hope people see this and it helps in your decision.  Very nice vacuum - bad idea for some carpets.

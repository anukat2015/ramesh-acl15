Title: Good vac for a small place
Content:
I'm a single guy who hates to clean -- and buy bags.  I have purchased many vacuums over the years, including: Meile Canister, Dyson, Panasonic Bagless, Kenmore Bagged, Hoover Windtunnel 1 (bagged), and Hoover Empower.  Each has its strenghts and weaknesses.
Compared with the above, I prefer the WindTunnel Bagless Canister.  Review:
-Cleaning Carpets:  Above average
-Cleaning Floors: Above average
-Cleaning with attachments: Best of the lot
-Cleaning with Power Hand Tool: Best of the lot
-Ease of emptying permanent HEPA filter: Average.  Better than earlier Hoover Bagless models, not as good as Dyson.
-Capacity of waste cup: Below average.  I have a 1000 sq ft place, and the cup is just about right for one cleaning.  For a larger place, you would have to empty the cup several times each cleaning.
-Noise level: Average
-Weight: Lighter than most
What makes this vac great for a small, crowded place is the fact that the unit is a highly portable canister, with the most powerful hand tools available.  These are perfect for reaching into corners and tight spots, places where a wide upright can't reach.
If I had a large place with lots of carpet, I'd consider the Hoover Windtunnel2 Bagless (I'd research this one carefully, given the negative reviews), the Dyson, or the Kenmore Bagless.

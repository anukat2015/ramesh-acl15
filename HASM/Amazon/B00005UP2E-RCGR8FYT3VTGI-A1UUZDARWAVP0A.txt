Title: good for vinyl or wood floors,not carpet !!
Content:
As you might gather,this vacuum is lousy on carpet.However it works fine on bare floors in small apartments or condos.Its easy to maneuver with swivel dusting nozzle and it rolls on the floor or it can be carried with handle or shoulder strap.As I said,this thing works fine on bare floors but for carpets you better plan on buying an upright too if you dont have one already.

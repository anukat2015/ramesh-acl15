Title: It's just dandy
Content:
We bought this vacuum 6 months ago to replace a Eureka Boss canister vac and I would say that it works just great.  Highly rated by Consumer Reports, and I really wanted to get a "bagless" to save on the cost of buying bags.
Our house is mostly hard floors with a little carpet.  We used the motorized head for several months, but stopped using it when the belt began slipping, and found that the wide filter head works just as well.
I noticed at least 3 or 4 Amazon reviewers complained about the belt slipping.  Answer:  Replace it.  It only takes 10 minutes or so and a screwdriver.  Ours started to slip after about 6 months of use--it was amazing how much old belt had stretched.
I *really* like the upholstery attachment.  Its brushes are powered by the force of the vacuum itself, and it works very, very well at removing cat hair from the seats of our dining room set--where the cat loves to perch.
Overall, a very competent vacuum--and the price is right.  I liked it enough that I bought one for my daughter!

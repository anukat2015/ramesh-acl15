Title: always hangs
Content:
bought this unit for my brother, works fine for a month after that it starts to hang now & then, he had it check up, BIOS was the suspected problem. To think i ordered it brand new, he also notice there where file pictures and videos in the hard drive.....so it was a used computer sold by amazon as brand new...

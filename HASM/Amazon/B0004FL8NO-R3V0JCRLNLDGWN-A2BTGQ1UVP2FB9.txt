Title: Rather well-done coffee maker
Content:
This unit replaced a similar Cuisinart unit which had failed. We were looking for a thermal carafe and 10-cup capacity. Black and Decker seems to have gotten most things right with this unit, such as the removable reservoir and a straightforward design.
Since I grind my own coffee, I found the #4 Mellita-style filters took some getting used to (i.e., getting the grounds into the filter without spillage). Also, the valves on the bottom of the filter bail and the top of the carafe don't slide across each other easily, so some fiddling was necessary until we got used to them.
Perhaps most important (and rarely mentioned in these reviews) is that we chose Black & Decker for its reputation for longevity; When we chose the TCM830, we had in mind an older B&D coffee maker (non-thermal-carafe) from 10 years ago which still works like it did out of the box.

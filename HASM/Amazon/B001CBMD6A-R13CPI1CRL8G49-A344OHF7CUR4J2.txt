Title: Great camera at a great price! thank you amazon!
Content:
Great camera, feels good in my and wife's hand, great pictures and it is really easy to use. After owning 5 point and shoot cameras, transition to Canon Rebel XS was truly a breeze. Ordered it on 21 December and it arrived on the 24th just is time for great pictures at the Christmas dinner table. What else could i ask for.
Thank you Amazon and Cameta Camera for offering this camera at such great price! Local Sears had it on sale for $599!

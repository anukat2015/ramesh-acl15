Title: Great coffee maker!
Content:
I've owned the Capresso MT 500 for over 2 years now with daily use making at least 2 pots each day.  My understanding is the Capresso is stainless steel lined so your water isn't in contact with aluminum in the heating/brewing process ever.  It heats the water hotter than other coffeemakers we've owned and stainless steel thermal carafe does a decent job of keeping coffee hot enough.  If it retained the amount of heat in the carafe a bit better this would be a 5. Fresh off the brewing gives you a great hot cup of coffee and it's important to me that there's no possibility of aluminum leaching anywhere into my coffee.  
It has also lasted longer than any of our previous machines.  The timer is easy to use although a bit on the small side.  We like this product so much that we purchased a spare recently in the event it breaks although it shows no sign of it.  Another plus is cleaning the system is rarely necessary and my product has a spot for a water filter.

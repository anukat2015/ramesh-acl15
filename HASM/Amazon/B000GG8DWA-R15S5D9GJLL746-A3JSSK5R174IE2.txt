Title: Optimus Rocks!
Content:
We live in a draftier-than-we'd-like-to-admit old house, a 100+ year old mansion that has been converted to apartments.  Beyond merely trying to "spot heat" rooms we're using rather than the whole house at once, we have become increasingly aware of the wattage of our space heaters, as two heaters running at 1500W each on a single breaker overloads it.
That said, this little heater, possible the cheapest of any we've picked up, performed the best.
GOOD - near-instant, radiant heat; a high setting that is equal to the low on most other heaters, and a low that's half that (at 800W & 400W); no fan so no draft; quiet; very reliable safety switch in base; lightweight and portable; stay-cool case; mechanical (instead of electronic) switch
BAD - radiant heat can be TOO hot; has melted a plastic mug; will set the dog on fire if she lays too close; don't trust this one left alone; fugly (mine came in brown, not white); use for "contact" heat aimed at you rather than heating a full sized room.
That said, using other electric, ceramic, oil filled radiant, baseboard radiant and mica heaters, this little guy puts out the most heat for the least dollars (at 800W, this costs less than .10 cents an hour to operate). Highly recommend this over more expensive and far less efficient.

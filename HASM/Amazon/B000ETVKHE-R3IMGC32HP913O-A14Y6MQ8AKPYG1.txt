Title: my Sansa speaks Korean now
Content:
Love this Sansa, Tech support was very helpful with a firmware updade to support the Korean language to make it more comfortable for my wife to use. Pictures look great on the unit but are fussy to get on and in the proper orientation. The unit is full but with the expansion slot you can carry lots of extra media with you. very nice sound, FM works great, happy with the choice to go with the sansa e260.

Title: Not enough suction
Content:
I purchased this product as a present for my sister and tried it last week.  I found that it did not have enough suction to remove the type of dirt or lint that accumulates on an automobile's carpet.  After several minutes of vigorously sweeping the carpet with this vacuum, I just gave up. I also tried to remove pet hair from the cloth upholstery, but again, the effort was in vain. I was attracted to this product by the low price and the generally favorable reviews, but after using it once, I just put it back in the box, and buried it deep in my sister's car trunk. I doubt it will ever come out of that box again.

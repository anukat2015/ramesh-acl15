Title: looks good, but leaks
Content:
This coffee maker worked really well for the first year I had it and still makes good coffee (that stays warm for a long time), but here are my problems with it:
1. You must wash out the grinder each time you want to make a pot of coffee (or use pre-ground beans instead).
2. It has started leaking small amounts of water onto my counter with each brew. Not sure where it's even coming from.

Title: Great at high altitude
Content:
Well, I just got back from a camping trip at 10,000' with my RV this last weekend. Outside temp at night was in the single digits. I had the Buddy going the whole weekend and my RV furnace did not cycle on once. This little unit did a great job keeping the temp around 60 degrees in the camper. I had read the owners manual and it stated that there might be a problem above 7,000' keeping the unit operational. The unit didn't cycle off once the whole weekend. This is a great product!

Title: iBook
Content:
My iBook is everything I expected it to be. It's not the fastest portable Mac, nor does it have the biggest screen. But it is inexpensive and eminently portable. the battery life is typically in the 3+ hour range (Under OS 9--OS X's power management needs work.) The keyboard and trackpad are comfortable, and it is very small and light. I use mine on a college campus, and people balancing huge Dell &quot;laptops&quot; are always gawking at this lean notebook. My only complaint is that the latch broke--it's under warranty, and it doesn't impede function, but it's irritating.

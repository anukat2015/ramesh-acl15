Title: Eureka vacuum
Content:
My last vacuum was a Eureka. I had this vacuum for 17 years. I was so happy with the quality and performance of this vacuum I automatically purchased another Eureka vacuum. The new vacuum has good suction; other than that it is a piece of junk! It is made of REALLY cheap plastic. If it lasts a year I'll be shocked. The onboard tools are the worst I have ever seen, and the vacuum bag is the size of a single serve microwave popcorn bag. You will be lucky to get through 3 or 4 rooms before the bag fills up. Also, the front wheel on this machine is made of molded plastic, seemed in the middle. It has scratched all my hardwood floors.

Title: After using 1 month
Content:
After using this laptop for a month, I am still very happy that I bought it.  It was a great price, $650 at the time, and the performance has been great.  Compared to my 4-year old Tecra (M 1.6Ghz), this is super fast.  Of the products in the same category that were available when I bought this, I would still say that this is best. I was even considering a netbook and I am VERY glad I didn't make that mistake. Spend a couple hundred more and get a little power.
What I like:
1) Price
2) The screen seems really big for such a small computer.
3) It's peppy (fast)
4) Windows 7. Took a couple weeks to get used to, now I hate going back to XP on my other computer.
5) It's wonderfully light. 
6) Battery lasts forever. I don't even bring the charger out with me most of the time. I don't even know what happens when the batter does run out. It hasn't happened yet :)
What I don't like:
1) Start up takes longer than I had hoped for. I'm pretty sure it's all the crap that Toshiba insists on putting on the computer. I'll get around to removing what I can one of these days.
2) The computer has hung on me a few times, which I wasn't expecting. During these times, I couldn't even get the task manager to come up. This time of hang was rare with XP.
3) The track pad is a pain. Multi-touch is terrible in this place. I keep resizing the screen when I don't want to.
4) The camera is not good quality, but it's about the same as other laptop cameras I've seen. I'd like a higher rez camera with better low-light conditions.

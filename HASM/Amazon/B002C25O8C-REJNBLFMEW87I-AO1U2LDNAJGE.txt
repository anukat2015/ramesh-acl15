Title: Ratings said "i told you!"
Content:
When i opened the box i was like 'WOW GREAT PC", after a few minutes i said "SH....T", the computer came with a dead pixel (a yellow line from the top to the bottom). It gave me problems when i attempted to make my back up D VD's, it didn't let me do them, every time i tried to do it it didn't allowed me to start. It also got stuck running 3 programs at a time, computer keep's getting frozen!
ADVICE: don't purchase this computer, it will give problems no matter what!

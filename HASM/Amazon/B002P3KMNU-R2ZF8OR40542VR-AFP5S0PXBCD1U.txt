Title: Amazing laptop
Content:
I purchased this laptop a month ago for school, and so far it has proven to be an amazing computer with few flaws.
Pros: 
- Amazing battery life, I cannot say enough about this.  I regularly push 10 hours of use with Wifi on and screen at 40%.
- 500gb HD is huge.  I tossed it into an external case and installed an OCZ SSD w/ Windows 7 Pro before ever booting it up.  Therefore I did not experience any bloatware.  Performance with the SSD is breathtaking, same as the SSD in my desktop.  I can't stand to use a computer with conventional spindle drives as boot disk anymore.  I do still use them for cold storage though.
- HDMI of course, this was a requirement for me.
- 4GB of RAM. 
- Very cool computer.  The fan hardly ever kicks on, and with an SSD this computer is literally completely silent.  It makes my desktop sound loud, which is very hard to do.
- No problems with Wifi, reception has so far been perfect.
- The keyboard is amazing, once you get used to the odd spacing between the keys.  Makes for fewer errors when typing, at least for me at 70WPM!
- Super thin and pretty light, I barely notice the weight in my backpack.
Cons:
- Glossy screen, but hard to find a laptop without one nowadays.
- Integrated graphics.  Thankfully I don't play many games, and the few I do play (Jedi Outcast, Jedi Academy, the Battlefield 1942 series) can manage.
- No backlit keyboard.  The one thing I really wish it had, but in light of all the pros this is a small fault.  Still worth 5 stars to me.
- Webcam isn't terribly great, but at least it has one.
I use this laptop mostly for office use, coding at school, and a fair amount of remote desktop.  Could not ask for a better computer for the price.
Overall, I cannot recommend this laptop highly enough provided that you don't play newer games with any regularity.

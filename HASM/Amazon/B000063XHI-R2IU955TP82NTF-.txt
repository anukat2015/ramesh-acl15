Title: Dissapointment
Content:
I was really dissapointed on this capresso coffeemaker. First of all, if you don't line up the carafe with the top perfectly, you will wake up with spilled coffee all over the kitchen counter. The carafe is impossible to clean inside allowing the old coffee to build up, giving it a horrible taste.  It really bother us, especially because this is a pretty pricey item. We will never recommend it to anybody.

Title: A freaking awesome player
Content:
I just bought this player a couple weeks ago and i'm so impressed it has so much more features then the ipod
also the quality is awesome and so are the EQs i like how u can put a picture as the background too. The picture quality is great and the software isnt bad it actually works alot better then what i thought since i reasd other reviews. I love it and now i listen to music all the time
The one thing i dont like is the headphones they're too short and with the remote too long but thats fine cause theres new accesories to go along with them and cases

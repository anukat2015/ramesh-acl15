Title: Good, if you can find a bag for it.
Content:
Do not waste your time on the Hoover Duros.  It is a nice machine but wait till you need to find replacement bags.  Costco and Best Buy sell the machine but not the bags, not even on their web sites.  Just try and find the SR replacement bags locally.  Good luck.  Even Hoover online does not sell them.  What a joke.

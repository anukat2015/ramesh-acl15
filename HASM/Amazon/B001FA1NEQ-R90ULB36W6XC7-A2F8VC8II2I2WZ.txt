Title: Great MP3
Content:
I got this to replace a 1'st gen Nano. This one is much cooler.  Love the video and picture resolution. Easy to use, and less expensive thru Amazon than Apple.  Color is a nice touch.  Only downside is that the charger from my old Nano is not compatible with this one.  This is a great product.  I am still an iPod girl!

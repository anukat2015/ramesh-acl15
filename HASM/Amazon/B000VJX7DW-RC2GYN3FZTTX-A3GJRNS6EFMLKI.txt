Title: only reason to buy this camera
Content:
this camera produces the most realistic and artistic file grain I have every seen. Noise is very beautifully rendered. Images are usable even at ISO as high as 3200.
Look at some full size images of the Canon 40d and even the more expensive 5D for comparison, you'll be surprised at how much more capable this camera is in low light.
Solid build, customizable menus and controls, 51 AF points......they just sweeten the deal even more.

Title: Had it up and running in 1 evening!
Content:
I bought this Hunter thermostat in order to replace an annoying and overly complicated model from Honeywell.  This is the first time I've ever had to replace a thermostat so I read through the manual quite a few times until I felt comfortable that I had my wiring labeled right and could proceed with the installation.  But with that said and done the Hunter unit went up quickly and I've found the auto programming easy to live with, after a little editing of the programs that is.  I'd definitely have to recommend this unit for its design because all the day-to-day features you need are right there at your finger tips, and you only need to go into the control panel to do a little fine tuning.

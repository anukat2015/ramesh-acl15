Title: Pellet Stove Friendly
Content:
Although our home has a central air and heating system, we have successfully used a pellet stove to heat our home for many, many years.  For our purposes, much more cost effiecient and the family enjoys watching the "dancing flames".  Our stove, like the majority of pellet stoves, can be operated by using a simple wall thermostat to turn the stove on and off, much like a conventional furnace.  Over the years, it has always been our practice to manually turn down the thermostat each night before retiring and turning it back up the next morning.  This generally works just fine except for those evenings when we forget.  Additonally, on those extra cold mornings, once the stove was turned on, it would take quite some time to get the temperature up to a comfortable level.  Neither of these situations is earth shattering, but as I get older, I must admit I continually try to make my life just a little bit easier.  This battery controlled thermostat has done just that.
I replaced an old Honeywell manual thermostat with this item, programmed it without a problem, and it has worked flawlessly for the last month.  It turns our pellet stove off 30 minutes prior to retiring and turns it back on 30 minutes before we get up.  It can also be programmed for up to 4 weekday settings, to accomodate your work schedule, and seperate settings for the weekend should this be a priority.  It is definetly not fancy but it is inexpensive and easy to operate and we are very pleased overall.

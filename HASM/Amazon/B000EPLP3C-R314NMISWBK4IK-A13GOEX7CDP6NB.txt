Title: Can't play MSN Music!
Content:
Outstanding, gorgeous, powerful, easy to use.... BUT, I'm shocked to learn that any music I ever downloaded from MSN Music (that is currently in my Windows Media Player library) in the past will NOT transfer to my ZUNE (doesn't matter that MSN owns both) because of the new digital coding that ZUNE requires. You either have to rip, burn to CD, and create MP3's of your prior downloads before the ZUNE will accept them, or buy the music again from ZUNE! This is the device to buy if you are starting a downloadable music library today, but if you already have a downloaded library, good luck!

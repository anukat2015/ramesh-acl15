Title: Canon 40D
Content:
I have only had this camera for about two weeks, and I can honestly say this will make you feel like a pro. Everything about it is top notch, I couldn't decide between this camera or the nikon d80. But after going out shooting with this I've had a lot of people asking me about it. The interesting thing even nikon owners. Buy this camera you won't regret the purchase. It is quality all the way around and the pictures are outstanding.I'm finally getting a hang of the manual mode and it won't be long before I never shoot automatic again.

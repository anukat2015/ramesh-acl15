Title: Good coffee, but with some comprimises
Content:
This coffee maker grinds and brews great coffee, but has some limitations (comprimises).  
 
The unit is tall, and won't fit under our cabinets (1960's house).
For best use, most components must be rinsed to remove underground beans (a few each time) and ground coffee sticking due to condensation.
The carafe is heavy and awkward to pour from, but does keep coffee hot.
So, not perfect, but we've decided to keep it after finding a spot on our limited counter space for the unit.  We love our coffee, and so nice to have fresh ground for every cup.

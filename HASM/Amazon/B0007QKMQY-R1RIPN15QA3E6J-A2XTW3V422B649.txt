Title: Excellent Camera for the $$
Content:
I've owned this camera for about six months now. As my first DSLR, I was slightly intimidated by learning all the manual features, but the XT is very easy to learn, and I find myself never ever using the auto modes. My pictures almost always turn out perfect, and if they don't it's my fault due to still learning. I was also a little worried about the reviews that say so much has to be done in photo editing, but I don't find this to be the case. I spend only minutes on some pictures, and others I don't have to change anything, save for erasing some dust spots.
My only complaints are these; The view finder is very small... Being near-sighted, it makes it a very slow process for me at times to do manual focus, though I do it anyway. However after a day of shooting I find my eyes hurting from the strain. This is where the 20D or 30D win. I played with a 20D at the camera shop, and was so happy that it only took me a split second to do manual focus with it. 
And then there is the small LCD screen. I thought I lived with it on my point and shoot, I can live with it here, however I can't. It makes it very hard to make sure your shot turned out as sharp as you were going for with such a small LCD, or it may just be my eyes. This is where the 30D wins. (if you can't tell, I just ordered a 30D, though I will still use my XT as often as I use my 30D)
Here is a tip that many have handed out. Skip the Kit lens. I bought it thinking "Well, they might not use it, but I will" .. I used it maybe once at the most. Save your money there, and put it towards better glass. A great starter, if the 18-55mm range appeals to you is the 17-85mm f/4-5.6 USM w/IS.

Title: I Love It, But....
Content:
When I first bought it I was SO excited b/c I bought it in Pink (my favorite color).  My interest soon faded.  The battery is VERY weak.  I get about 6 hours of battery life instead of the advertised 18.  Since it's internal, it's a little hard to replace.  And sometimes the click-wheel freezes so I'm stuck listening to the same playlist until it decides to work again.

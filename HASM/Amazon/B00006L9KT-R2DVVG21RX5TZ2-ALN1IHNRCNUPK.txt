Title: Not that great
Content:
Bought this and returned it the next day.  It couldn't keep the flame lit due to the new safety vaulve on the propane tanks...kept fizzling out after a few seconds.  The lighter included fell apart after one or two times of trying to light it.  The threads on both ends of the hose weren't quite right, and we had a very difficult time getting them onto the torch and the propane tank.  It's made in China, so the quality wasn't too surprising.

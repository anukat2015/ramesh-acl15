Title: DeLonghi oil-filled heater review (TRD0715T)
Content:
I have had the heater now for the last month. Our bedroom is at the end of the home heating circuit (water filled radiators) and we decided to boost the heat in the bedroom. I love the DeLonghi TRD0715T. It had worked according to expectations thus far with no issues - no weird odors, or sounds. It manages to keep our rather large bedroom (36 ft X 20 ft) nice and toasty. I have it set to come on an hour before we retire for the night and have it turn off an hour before we wake up. The 700 watt setting has worked just fine, although we are just starting into cooler weather. I expect to jump to one of the higher power settings in the coming winter months. The heater's top surface gets warmest but even that is not scalding hot. I can touch it without burning my hand, but can keep it there for only a few seconds.
The main downside of the heater is the extra floor space it takes up. I would have loved to have a wall-mounted heater with the nice properties of the oil-filled radiator. Oh well... (I realize there are wall mounted heaters but the reviews talked about crackling noises etc and I did not want to risk issues).

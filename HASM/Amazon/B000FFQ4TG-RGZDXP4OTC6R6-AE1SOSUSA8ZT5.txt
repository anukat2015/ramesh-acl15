Title: Not the old time Bunn
Content:
We are not at all pleased with this Bunn.  For starters the carafe does not pour without dripping. No matter how hard you try, it is almost impossible not to make a mess when pouring a cup of coffee. It does not heat the coffee to a very hot temperature and we were not aware when we bought this coffee maker that it does not have an automatic shut off.  Save your money, you can get a much better coffee maker at a much lower price.

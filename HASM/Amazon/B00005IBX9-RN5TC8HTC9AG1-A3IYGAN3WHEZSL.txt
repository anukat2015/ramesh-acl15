Title: Ok coffee, bad design
Content:
Bought this as a replacement for a very good Braun machine which, however, turned up its toes and died for no reason, as Brauns apparently do. The Cuisinart makes good enough coffee, but when you use it, you will see that the clumsiness and stupidity of its design is breathtaking. It is not as easy to fill with water as other coffee makers, but you can get used to that. But try to brew a full, or close to full pot, and you will discover when you finish that there are coffee grounds all over the inside, and no way to clean it other than to unplug it, hold it under a spray (preferably) faucet, and wash them out. Possible, but clumsy and inefficient.

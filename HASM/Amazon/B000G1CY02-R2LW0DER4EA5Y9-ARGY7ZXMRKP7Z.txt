Title: Don't believe CR.org always gets it right!
Content:
I purchased one of these on Amazon after reading reviews from Consumer Reports where they called it a "best buy."  Not so.  In less than four uses it stopped functioning properly - will not stay on for more than 5 - 10 minutes at a time, and has poor heat output when it IS on.  I feel cheated.  Save your money and buy a $[...] ceramic heater - it will work better and last longer than this piece of junk.

Title: quality issues?
Content:
I purchased the D90 together with the Nikon 18-200 lens and was quite happy with it, but then I started to get ERROR messages and the camera would lock up. Sometimes with the infamous CHR codes, sometimes without. to get it working again, I had to remove the battery and release the lens, sometimes every 5 minutes (ouch). 
Looking in relevant forums, one can see that this is quite common and many people are reporting problems with the D90. in many cases it's related to bad contact of the lens, in other cases bad contact of the memory card, in other cases nothing helps...
I was about to get it back and have it fixed or replaced, when it was stolen from me - now I debate with myself what would be the next one.
There are problems in any such hi-tech gadget, but it seems like there are too many with the latest Nikon model - ?
BTW When the camera was working for me, it produced excellent pictures.

Title: Love my new camera!
Content:
I am by no means a professional but when I wanted my first DSLR camera I did a lot of research and ended up making the D40 my choice. My original choice was first the D80, then I changed to the D200, but when my husband thought the prices were too much for a toy, I reevaluated and chose the D40 for it's performance and price. I mainly used [...] as my research site, and he was a great help. I have always used Canon, but when I decided on a DSLR, I wanted Nikon. I don't feel like the transition was too hard- especially since this was my first SLR. It takes a bit of time to learn and patience to get your manual settings right, but when you need a quick fix, the "P"(program) setting works great. For a first time SLR, I think this was a great choice, and the lens that comes with the kit is great.

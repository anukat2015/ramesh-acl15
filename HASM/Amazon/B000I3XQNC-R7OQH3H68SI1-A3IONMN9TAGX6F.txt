Title: simple, light, kinda affordable, bigger lcd screen, with soso lens
Content:
I think the shutter sound if just fine, not sure why people care about that, actually it would be better if it was stealth quiet for animals photos and sensitive moments, and the 1.6x conversion is no biggy, the dust removal can be shut off so the camera can start up even faster if needed, this wasn't in the spec of speeds. the lens makes that sound of greasy bearings only when focusing and when zooming. all the digital menu design is just fine, you can make shortcuts for the main 4 buttons. like iso or foucs style, etc. what a nice day, ahhh.

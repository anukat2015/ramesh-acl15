Title: Great for a Japanese Apartment but . . .
Content:
My wife insisted on getting this because it is small and light "like she had in Japan."  It has a pretty powerful motor but the beater brush is not powered and is not good for deep carpet.  It handles upholstery well but could use better attachments.  I will probably invest in different attachments.  This is fine for vacuuming tatami or wood floors but for carpeting, I want something with a powerhead.
Pros
Small and light
Good power
Retractable cord
Con
Not good for carpet
Mediocre attachments

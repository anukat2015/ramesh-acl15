Title: What a fabulous Bargain!
Content:
I was apprehensive about replacing my seven year old HP laptop.  It served me well but had some hiccups that I had become accustomed to.  The thought of adapting to Windows 7, Office 2007 and new hardware besides was daunting.  
I couldn't be happier! Windows 7 is a dream and the laptop itself is really an easy machine to work with and no idiosyncracies.  The price was a complete bargain!  I did my market research and ASUS was listed as the best buy for the money, but I didn't expect to be so happy!  I had heard that the touch pad and keyboard were not responsive and that people had trouble using the camera, etc because the instructions weren't included.  I found everything simple to use and intuitive.  I would highly reccomend this computer to everyone, not just the budget conscious.

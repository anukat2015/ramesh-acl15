Title: Good coffee get cold fast!
Content:
This unit makes good coffee, but the stainless steel 'thermos' is almost useless in keeping the coffee warm. One of the features of the maker was supposed to be that the "Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot and tastefully fresh for hours", but in reality coffee that has been in the carafe for 30 minutes needs warming. I've had this unit for a year and a half and it's been a disappointment from day one. I should have returned it after the first use.

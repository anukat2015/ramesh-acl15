Title: Great camera
Content:
This camera is overall excellent - great for the beginner photographer but enough advanced features for the more experienced.  My only complaint is that the plastic body and knobs have a sort of cheap feel to them.  Photo quality is excellent.  Does not come with any memory flash card.  Battery life is excellent.

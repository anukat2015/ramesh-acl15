Title: Great coffee brewer!
Content:
First of all, yes, it has a smnall opening to pour the cold water from the carafe to the brewing chamber.  But we are all adults and this incoveniance is more than offset by its other great features!  We just retired a Mr Coffee cofee maker that took forever to finish brewing and kept coffe at a mediocre temperature so that we had to microwave it to drink.  The automaotic off was permantently set at 2 hours and by the time it was finished brewing it was almost time to shut off.
This coffee maker brews HOT coffee real quickly! It also keeps on for 4 hours, instead of just 2, like almost all others.  The water filter that is built in also keeps the water passing through to the heater to be cleaner than just from the tap.  And, although replacing those filters is an added expense, I feel it is well worth it.
 
This is our second Cuisinart coffee maker and I expect that this will be our prefered brand of coffee makers from now on!

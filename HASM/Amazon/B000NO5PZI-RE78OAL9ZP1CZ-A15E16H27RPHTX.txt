Title: Great!
Content:
We had a Hoover Dirt Finder ($176) for about 10 years. Same parts kept breaking over and over and we finally got tired of constantly fixing it. We needed a new vacuum and did some research and found that Bissell in general had better reviews than any other brand. Found this vacuum at Sam's Club for $89 and decided to give it a whirl. Some minor assembly and it was ready to go. On the first try we picked up so much dirt we changed the cup about 3 times (we have wall-to-wall carpet). Yuck! I normally vacuum 3-4 times a week and was shocked at the amount of dirt it picked up. The suction is so good that the vacuum takes you for a walk.
Pros:
Great price, suction, cord length, cleaning brush attachment, easy to empty canister, lightweight, washable pre-motor filter.
Cons:
Tips over easy, lost suction due to a clog and had to disconnect (1 screw) the tube on lower right hand side to unclog, needs HEPA filter which ranges from $8-$12 (though in 4-5 months I haven't had to change it and it came with 2)

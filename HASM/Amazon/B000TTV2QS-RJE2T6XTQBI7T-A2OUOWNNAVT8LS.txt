Title: adjunct to motor home
Content:
We are using this heater in a motorhome, to supplement the heating system.  Although we're just beginning winter, it appears that this heater is exactly what we had in mind.  The heater is sturdy and we're comfortable with it around two energetic cats.  It maintains the temperature well, and occilates to distribute the warmth.

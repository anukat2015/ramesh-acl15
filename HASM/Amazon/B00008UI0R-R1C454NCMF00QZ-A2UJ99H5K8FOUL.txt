Title: Broken after 11 months
Content:
I received this as a housewarming gift in January 2007. 11 months later, it hardly ever turns on. It is totally broken. Spoke to Hoover and they told me to bring it to the service center since it was in warranty. Did that, they told me they could not fix it. Hoover will not stand by their product and Amazon can't help me after the 6 month point. So I am stuck with a vacuum that doesn't even turn on. Save yourself the aggrivation and don't buy a Hoover .What a nightmare. And amazingly, Hoover couldn't care less and actually told me that I should buy a new vacuum. One rep on their help desk asked me 'what do you expect for $180?'. Outrageous. Don't buy this product. I threw mine away and bought a Dyson. What a shame. A waste of money and I am sure there are others all over the place buying this horrible product and just throwing it away in under a year.

Title: Junky and performs poorly
Content:
Does a poor job of cleaning floors and is not worth the price.
It's a mess to add liquids and a pain to clean the unit.
After the first use my wife complained about the product. After the second use she put it in the closet and there it remains. 
She now grabs and inexpensive old-fashioned sponge-mop and gets the cleaning job done in minutes.

Title: Defective at 14 months
Content:
I was attracted to the many cool features of this product, and it worked well until 2 months after it's warranty expired.  Then suddenly the audio signal went to one-channel only, with lots of distortion and intermittent total interruptions, i.e. it is unlistenable.  I paid >$100 for this thing.  It was not worth it.  Unacceptable product life.

Title: Hoover Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
This vacuum cleaner would get a 5-star rating from me except that the dirt container fills up quickly, which is annoying. (I think this must be true of all bagless vacuum cleaners.)  The solution is to tote around a plastic shopping bag or wastebasket as you clean and empty the container into it after vacuuming each room.  In the long run, I think the bagless is a better way to go than to keep buying bags, which gets expensive.

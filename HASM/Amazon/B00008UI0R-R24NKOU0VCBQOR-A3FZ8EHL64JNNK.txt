Title: Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
I was hesitant to buy this vacuum because I was not sure if it was going to have enough suction.  Well...........it is awesome.  For the money you cannot beat it.  It picks up more dirt from the carpet than my Electrolux.  I have bad allergies so I need to vacuum almost everyday and the amount of stuff it picks up is unbeleivable.  Recommend it highly.  It does have a small dust cup but who cares you just empty more often. Just love it!

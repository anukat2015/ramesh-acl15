Title: Took 6 months to kill it
Content:
We owned this coffee maker for 6 months before it finally "lost it's mind".  One design flaw is the down under programming feature which after flooding itself, no longer works. I will be looking for a side mounted clock this time.  We suspect the tank warped and leaked into the bottom; shorting out the electronics.
The "line up the arrows" scene is irritating too.  You have to line up arrows to screw on the lid and the filter basket has to be installed just so. Even if the lid is installed correctly, the coffee ends up all over the counter. The carafe also fails to keep the coffee hot enough, but it's still better than just glass.  I am shopping for a new coffee maker right now.  Pass on this.

Title: A Big Disappointment for the price
Content:
We purchase our coffee from a coffee store and grind it ourselves.  We do like hot and strong coffee.  The reviews for the Capresso were so good we didn't think we could go wrong.  We had been using a Krups machine that finally became unreliable with age.  The first thing I noticed with the Capresso was that the thermal carafe was sort of triangular in shape.  It looked stylish but it was hard to pour the last bit of water out of it.  You had to go &quot;head-over-heels&quot;.  That was king of annoying, particularly when filling the water reservoir.  You don't want to leave water in the carafe.  Another problem we had was that the coffee was not hot.  We like hot coffee.  We have an instant-hot water dispenser in our kitchen and even tried preheating the carafe with the steaming water.  Still the coffee was not really hot.  And without a burner, it doesn't get any hotter with time.  We also like strong coffee.  We use Sumatra grind it &quot;fine&quot;.  With the Capresso, the usual amount of coffee we used in the Krups made weaker coffee.  We even tried adding more.  I don't know if it was the charcoal filter or what, but it wasn't the same.  We bundled it up and sent it back.  Bought a high-end Mr. Coffee that was a fraction of the price.  Has its problems but the coffee is strong and hot.

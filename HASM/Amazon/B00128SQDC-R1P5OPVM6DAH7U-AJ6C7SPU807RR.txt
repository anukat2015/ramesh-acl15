Title: Great camera, but overexposes a lot in automatic mode
Content:
Nikon D80 is my first Digital SLR(In fact, first serious camera I bought), my previous camera was canon SD1000 point and shoot. Overall I am pleased with the picture quality. But I don't like the fact that Nikon D80 overexposes photos a lot in automatic mode. Many of the photos I took in bright sunlight is washed out. After reading and experimenting a lot, I learned to take pictures in manual model, with different metering(SPOT and CENTER WEIGHTED) to avoid this issue. But after spending about 1299 $, I don't like  the performance of the camera in automatic mode at all. I hope Nikon will release a firmware update to fix the metering. If you are a novice DSLR person like me, and is considering buying a system, I suggest you go with Canon EOS 40D, I haven't used it, but after researching a lot online, I haven't come across major issues with EOS 40D. Experts can correct me if I am wrong.

Title: Great Value! Excellent Performance
Content:
Solid laptop for the price. Comes with blazing fast i5 core processor and 4gb of DDR3 ram with a 1gb dedicated ATI video card. That's not all, it comes with a humongous 500gb 7200RPM HDD. The windows starts up in like 30 seconds. I can literally surf the web, watching a movie, and burning a dvd at the same time without feeling a single hiccup. This laptop will do almost anything you throw at it. This laptop is awesome for work, school, entertainment and some gaming. This isn't really a gaming laptop. It will run older games at max settings without hiccups but some newer game might only run at medium-high. However the LED could use better resolution for the site, and perhaps a bit better contrast. The battery is average with about 2-3.5 hours depends on usage. The ventilation on this laptop is amazing with the exhaust on the left side. Even with heavy usage (i'm talking playing a game in window mode, with youtube, and MSN running) the laptop is still only get a bit warm. I have yet to see this laptop get really hot.
Pros:
- Blazing fast CPU
- 4gb of DDR3 ram
- Decent GPU
- 500gb 7200 RPM 
- HDMI output
- Great speakers
Cons:
- Low resolution screen.
- Low resolution Webcam (Not really a cons for me, I don't use it)
Overall this laptop was a great buy for me. I was researching around the market for months before I decided to get this one. It fits all my needs. I do wish it has a better LED though but for the price I think I'm content with what I've got.

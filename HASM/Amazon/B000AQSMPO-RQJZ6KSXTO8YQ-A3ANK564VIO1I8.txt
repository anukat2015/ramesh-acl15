Title: Product breaks after 3 weeks of usage
Content:
I am on my 3rd Keurig.  The first 2 died after 3 weeks of normal usage and now this one has just died.  I will never purchase another Keurig product.  These used to be made with good quality.  It's a shame because it is a nice product until it dies.
Clearly the company has reduced the quality to increase their margins and guess what - now they are junk.  Fix your product Keurig!!

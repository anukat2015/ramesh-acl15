Title: SO FAR SO GOOD
Content:
WE JUST PURCHASED THE EDENPURE FOR OUR BASEMENT, OUR SON, DAUGHTER INLAW AND GRANDSON ARE LIVING WITH US AND THE BASEMENT IS A LITTLE COLD, WE NEEDED SOMETHING A LITTLE EXTRA TO KEEP IT A LITTLE WARMER DOWN THERE THAT WOULD BE COOL TO THE TOUCH AND COULD SIT ON THE CARPET WITHOUT BURNING IT. AND SO FAR IT IS WORKING GREAT. IT IS ALL ABOUT EXPECTATIONS AND WHAT YOU NEED OUT OF THAT PRODUCT YOU ARE BUYING AND WHAT YOU USE IT FOR. EDENPURE IS WORKING FOR US SO FAR, WE DIDNT BUY IT TO HEAT A WHOLE HOUSE OR TO BRING DOWN ELECTRIC BILLS. OUR MAIN CONCERN WAS THAT IT WAS SAFE AND COOL TO THE TOUCH AND STILL ADD WARMTH TO ONE ROOM. I PLAN ON WRITING ANOTHER REVIEW AFTER WE HAVE HAD THIS PRODUCT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

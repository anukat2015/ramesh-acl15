Title: Great Camera, but showing it's age
Content:
I've owned a Nikon D40 for more than a year now, and more recently had bought a Canon XTI/400D.  I've been wanting to upgrade to something more than an entry-level camera, and I've been eyeing the D80 for a while now, so I decided to go for it.  It' s a great camera, but not without it's shortcomings.
Pros:
-Well-built, love holding it in my hand.  The controls are pretty well-placed so that most of the settings you usually would want to change quickly are within easy reach, not buried in some menu.
-As an upgrade to the D40, the D80 allows for more lens choices.  In my case,  I wanted the D80 so I can get some prime lenses.
-Contrary to how others feel,  I love it's matrix metering.  Maybe it's because I'm used to the D40's which is similar to the D80's, so I know what I'm going to get with matrix metering.
-It's simply fast and responsive.
-great 2.5-inch LCD display, plus top LCD which can be lit up is great for looking at some last minute info.
Cons:
Well, I'm not listing them individually.  I would just like to say that as far as this camera's shortcomings are concerned, they are pretty much caused by the D80's age.  I just bought mine a few days ago (march '08), and  at this time, the D80 has been out for two years and there are features that more recent cameras have that is missing from the D80.  More important to me are live view, and wider (and finer fine tuning of) image parameter settings (which is great on the Canon XTI), automated sensor cleaning, and maybe a bigger LCD. 
BUT, the price of the D80 has gone down considerably. It's much cheaper than the Canon 40D and not that much more than a rebel XTI, so I believe that the D80 is a great buy at this time.  It's just a matter of priorities.

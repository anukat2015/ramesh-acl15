Title: Apple's philosophy: If it works, "fix" it so it doesn't.
Content:
Apple produced a mighty mite with this Shuffle 2nd generation, so why did they mess with it and, in the process, provoke much vocal dissatisfaction from buyers of the Shuffle 3.  The come-on with the new one, of course, is more memory in less space, and leave behind the old "square" for a phallic-shaped (but pencil thin!) rocking little number.  And of course fix it so the customer has to purchase a replacement cable from you know whom--and don't overestimate the intelligence of the consumer: who among us would have any idea about what's on our iPods were it not for an audio announcement before each track?
This 1GB iPod is a gem and is, moreover, highly utilitarian.  It'll hold over 200 jazz tracks, and I can put it in a pajama pocket with the ear-buds underneath my pillow.  And you don't have to drape it around your neck or depend on a pocket--just clip it anywhere, and it stays.  I've just realized that despite all of the possibilities available to me on my iPod Touch (those thousands of apps!), I rarely use it--and then only for listening to music.  I would have been smarter to have picked up 7-8 of these at the same price.
As for the sound quality, it's brilliant and clear with the included Apple ear buds, and if I plug it into the audio jack of my stereo the sonic spectrum is as replete, the volume levels as full, as any sound-reproducing mechanism in my repertory.  And best of all it'll run 10-12 hours before the next charge.  (Wish I could say the same about my Macbook and Mac Air, both of which are giving me barely over an hour on a single charge.)

Title: Doesn't make good coffee
Content:
I did all the research and read all the reviews and purchased the Keurig B60. It was fun for about a week. The clean-up is easy, it works fast, I really have fun using it. It is cool, no doubt. I just haven't had a really yummy cup of coffee yet. Every cup is weak and tasteless. And I like weak coffee! Dunkin Donuts is my favorite coffee for goodness sakes! My Krups made much better coffee. I think now that the novelty has worn off, I'll try the Tossimo. By the way, I tried Timothy's, Caribou (which had the most flavor), Donut shop, Glorias, Vermont, Tully's and Green Mountain. ALL TASTELESS pretty much. I am bummed because the concept is really cool. It also takes 2 K cups to make fill a regular size coffee mug. That's not really cost effective. The coffee wasn't that hot either. I had to nuke it after about 2 minutes.

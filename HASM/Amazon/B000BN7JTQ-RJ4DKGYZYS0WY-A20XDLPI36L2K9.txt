Title: Tastes like BLAH
Content:
What a horrible cup of coffee!  I tried everything:
1) multiple brands/strengths of coffee
2) multiple volumes of coffee ground in the filter
3) different levels of water
etc...  Hell, I finally even tried brewing it twice to see what would happen.  
No good.  I've probably brewed 30 or 40 cups of coffee in this thing and they all suck!

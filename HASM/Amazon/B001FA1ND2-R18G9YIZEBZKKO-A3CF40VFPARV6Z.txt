Title: iPod hold out finally gives in
Content:
I purchased a 1G iRiver the size of a disposable lighter back when that was an expensive geek toy and loved it. I then went to an 8G Sansa Lil'Monster - incompatible when I switched to an iMac at home to get away from Windows - but otherwise praiseworthy. TheApple iPod nano 8 GB Green (4th Generation)is a swell little music player. It's USB cable was compatible with a Griffen USB slot equipped AC charger I found lying around the house. Yeah, the nano doesn't have an FM radio or voice recorder which would be the cherry on top - but it is simple to use,tiny and ultra lightweight. The accelerator is goofy fun. Overall I'm happy I bought it. Nice in the purse, pocket, bed, on the airplane or elliptical. Did I say tiny! light!? Plus, it's a shiny, cheerful green.

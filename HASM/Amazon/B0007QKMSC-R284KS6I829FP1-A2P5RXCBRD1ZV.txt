Title: I love it!
Content:
This is our first digital camera ever, but it is also in addition to my Canon Rebel film camera.  I got this one because it would be compatible with all the lenses and filters that I already have for the film Rebel, plus have the convenience of a digital camera.  I am learning a lot more from this one than I could have from the film version.  With the film version, you have to remember what you did to each frame, or write it down.  But, with the digital camera, all I have to do is look at the details, either in the camera, or on my computer to know what I did to each shot I take.  It's not exactly an ideal camera to take with you everywhere you go, because it's a little bulky, plus you have to carry around the additional lenses, filters and whatever else you might want.  But, I still love the camera.  My fiancee and I are getting married in February, and then going to St. Lucia for our honeymoon, and we can't wait to use this camera there to take pictures of all the beautiful scenery.

Title: works very well
Content:
I bought this unit brand new this year (2010) it now has new freeon in it mandated by the fed Govt.
The new stuff used nowdays has to be ran with higher rpm and compressor pressure. Im saying that because this unit is atad louder than my other window units. Nothing really annoying, but I think its more of the conversion to the new freon than anything, so all new a/c's will be affected. with that said, the a'c gives out good cold air, very nice remote control that has a magnet in it so it sticks on side of the unit or the fridge ect.

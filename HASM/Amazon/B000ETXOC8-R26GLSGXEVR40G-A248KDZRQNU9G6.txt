Title: Useful but frustrating
Content:
We bought two.  The support documentation out of the box was poor at best.  What documentation was given refered to a CD that was not included with either.  (Much more useful information is available at the company website.) 
One player was returned to Amazon as defective; the screen went black and would not respond to any command.
For the player that we kept, my contact with the company's tech support late on a Sunday afternoon was very helpful and resolved a vexing problem.

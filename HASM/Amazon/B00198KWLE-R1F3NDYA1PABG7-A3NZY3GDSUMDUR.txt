Title: Dell Inspiron 1525 Overheating Issue
Content:
I bought the Dell Inspiron 1525 as a high-school graduation gift for my daughter last year. She took it to college and had nothing but problems. The laptop would shut down for no apparent reason. We spent hours on the phone with Dell support who could not fix the problem. Since that time I have done a number of internet searches and found that this particular model has a tendency to overheat, which causes the laptop to automatically shut down. End of story - I bought my daughter an Apple Macbook and she is very happy. Stay away from Dell.

Title: Not as good as I hoped
Content:
I have 6 cats so you can imagined the hair I have floating around. After reading reviews on various websites it seemed like a good tool. It works ok but does not get all the hair out of my carpets. Easy to clean but my large vacuum works much better. It is fine for light duty work but don't expect miracles!

Title: Was skeptical...now a believer
Content:
My husband bought this, and I thought it was very expensive for a coffee maker, and I doubted that it could keep the coffee warm without the typical warmer under the pot. I was wrong. The convenience of being able to take the coffee straight to the table is matched by how well this thermos keeps it hot. We bring a full pot to the table and read three newspapers each morning, and the last cups are always as hot as the first.
The machine brews very quickly, is easy to program so that the pot is ready for you when you wake up, and it's as easy as any other maker I've had to clean. I like the fact that I can't break the pot, and I don't EVER have to worry about whether I left it on when I leave the house. 
So for all that, this coffee maker is worth the money, and it looks like my husband was right. Just don't tell him.  ;)

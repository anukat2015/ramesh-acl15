Title: Nice Small Personal Heater
Content:
I am happy with this dish heater. Great for taking the chill off when within 4 feet or so. 300 watts saves electric.
Don't expect this small heater to do a large area. Quality is good so far. In a 10' X 12' room a lot of heat coming off the top of the heating coil will warm up the room.
On damp and chilly days it works as expected. Read the reviews and decide if it's right for you.

Title: Great camera .
Content:
I've owned it for about nine months. I won't go into a detailed writeup since pleanty of other people have already done so. Here is a quick summary of the strong points and weak points of this camera. 
Strengths:
* 6 FPS - Fast enough for photojournalism and sports on a budget.
* Build qulity and ergonomics much improved from 20d, has a more solid      feel, and finger grip makes a big difference
* Good color rendition. 
* Good sharpness and detail
* Good high ISO noise. Not the same as the Mark III, but very good at     this price. I use 640 and 800 routinely, and the qulity is beyond what's required for the publications I shoot for, even without any noice reduction software either in camera or in post processing. 
* Live view. Despite the akward procedure for focusing, having any form of live view helps a lot when taking a very high or very low angle. 
* Highlight tone priority. It helps a little, a good extra. 
Weaknesses:
* 'Weather sealing'. The foam strip on the card door is a joke, it should have had d200 level protection. Inexcusible, shame on Canon. I would have paid more for a big improvement here. 
* Screen. It's big, but not very accurate. Often isn't sharp enough for me to tell if I got the shot in focus or not. Color, brighness, contrast can look off too. Sometime shots look like garbage on the scree, but are fine in photoshop.
* Plastic battery door hinge. They made the rest of the camera sturdier, yet cheaped out on this part to save $0.10. WTF?
* Autofocus at 5.6 can be frustrating. When trying to get a bird through branches, it often misses even when the center dot is right on the bird. 
* Anit-dust. It makes little to no noticable difference. I change lenses often and the 40d sensor has as much dust stuck to it as my 20d did. 
Overall, it takes great images. There's always things they could have done better, but remember, you are only paying $1,100 for it so you can't expect the world. The lack of sealing is my only major beef.

Title: Great camera for the money
Content:
I bought this camera a few weeks ago as an upgrade of another great DSLR of my own (OLY E500) and also to take advantage of the existing lenses, filters and flashlight formerly acquired for this later. Despite to have taken during several years very good pics with the E500, I would like to stress that the enhancements included in the E620 represent a great added value when comparing it with the older DSLR version: Live view, Image Stabilization, 7 AF points, CMOS sensor, Swivel LCD, art filters and, of course, greater resolution and sensitivity. The several tests that I have made in different conditions gave me so far very pleasant results and so I am delighted with my new purchase.

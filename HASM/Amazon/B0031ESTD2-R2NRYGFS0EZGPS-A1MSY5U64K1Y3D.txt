Title: Much better than a netbook!
Content:
As another reviewer mentioned, this laptop is a powerhouse!
The screen is just beautiful, and 11.6 inches is perfect for viewing.
The current 9 inch mini netbooks are too far on the small side, for my liking, but
this one straddles the line between portability & pleasant viewing, easily.
It's very sleek, very thin, solidly built, though light.
Windows 7 is an absolute marvel, erasing those awful memories of the vista experiment.
Windows 7 is so intuitive & well thought out, one need not even read the tutorial.
This OS blends everything beautifully, leaving a well organized (and easy to get to)
list of files & folders.
This Toshiba may be more expensive than the current breed of budget netbooks, but it is
well worth the extra money.
It does everything so well, from booting up to displaying video, all with a streamlned speed & grace.
My only issue is the somewhat flimsy feel of the keyboard.
It's nicely laid out, but one is almost afraid to hit the keys too hard.
Overall, an excellent addition to Toshba's Satellite family of notebooks.

Title: 12 cup Cuisinart coffee maker
Content:
We recently ordered and received the 12 cup,programable, Cuisinart coffee maker with the automatic dispenser. Prior to using this coffee maker we had tried other brands including caraff and auto dispenser. We prefered the auto dispenser as the coffee stays hot without the burned flavor.  The other brands of auto dispenser dripped after use and made a mess we had to clean up daily.  Although this coffeemake cost more, it is by far the best value for your dollar.  No drippy mess!! Easy to fill and use and easy to clean.  It also has adjustable strength, and auto on program. Love this product!!!!! and would highly recommend it to serious coffee drinkers.  Well worth the price and very fast shipment from the seller.Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable Coffeemaker

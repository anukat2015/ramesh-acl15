Title: Great for homes without much carpet!
Content:
I have had this vacuum for several years and LOVE it! I vacuum almost daily, and the vacuum has fablulous suction and is light and just keeps working. No problems whatsoever. I did throw the carpet attachment out at one point because it is heavy and unnecessary. We have mostly wood or tile floors, and one big living room rug, and the Magic Blue is perfect.

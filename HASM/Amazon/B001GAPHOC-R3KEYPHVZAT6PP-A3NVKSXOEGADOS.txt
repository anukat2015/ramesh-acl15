Title: Thoughly Enjoy This Camera
Content:
This camera takes excellent pictures both outdoors and indoors.   The menu is easy to access.   Buttons are similiar to other Pentax cameras.   The largest print I make is a 5 x 7.  Noise is minimal, even at ISO 3200 indoors.  I went to a museum and took some shots using the museum setting (no flash), again great pictures.  
  I use an 18 - 200 zoom lense. When using the flash I do have to be careful not to zoom.  I have had a few pictures come out to dark because I was beyond the range of the flash.  However, using a higher ISO takes care of this problem, or just moving in closer.
   I use AA Lithium Ultimate batteries.  I haven't used up a set yet,  I've used them before and am sure they will last for over a thousand pictures.  Camera is always ready, I don't need to worry about charging batteries.  
   Sure there are additional features available on more expensive cameras, but I'm not willing to pay the money.  I don't strive to be any type of professional photographer.  I just wanted a camera that would take better quality pictures at higher ISOs than compact point and shoot cameras.  This one is it.  
    I've used some of the maual settings with success, a fun camera!

Title: Great little mp3 - but discontinued.. and half feaatures no longer work
Content:
HI there, 
I love my connect.  Have had it for years.. the sound quality is great and I really have no complaints about the hardware itself.  Buttons are intuitive and the expandability makes it do everything I need it to.
CONS:  this sansa is discontinued.  The software was tied to yahoo music services and once they stopped yahoo you lose half of the feaatures you paid for.. including the wifi being a joke at that point.  you cant connect wirelessly to your  pc, you only could connect to the internet to download music from rhapsody.  great idea.. but now gone.

Title: Not perfect but close
Content:
Disclaimer: This review is being written after the first day of use -- no representations on long-term reliability.
PROS (in the order that we noticed them): inexpensive -- particularly on Amazon, small, cute, lightweight, lots of attachments, easy to assemble, variable power control conveniently located on handle, quiet, excellent suction, clever pivoting head which follows contour of floor and baseboards, non-marring on hard wood floors, positive latching mechanism on dirt cup, auto-retractable cord.
CONS (in the order that we noticed them): attachments affix to wand and fall off, attachment mount on wand makes it difficult to slide wand under furniture, despite large wheels unit does not roll easily, dirt cup fills quickly.
We have mostly hardwood floors in our apartment and purchased the Dirt Devil after initially buying a Bissell upright for about the same price (big mistake).  The difference between the two is like night and day.  Every vacuum involves some compromises especially in this price range but the Vision is as close to perfect as we have seen.

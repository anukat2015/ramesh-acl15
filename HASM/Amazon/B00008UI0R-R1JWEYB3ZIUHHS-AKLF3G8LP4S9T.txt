Title: HEAVY & awkward, but works
Content:
After reading a gazillion vacuum reviews I felt it was only fair to write one.  I've had the Windtunnel for about 2 years now.  I am reading other vacuum reviews because my back hurts significantly after using the Windtunnel to vacuum my upstairs (5 bedrooms).  It is HEAVY (31 lbs) and bulky.  I am an average-sized, fit female in late 30's and have never had back pain from housework or other activities before using the Windtunnel in this larger house.  
That being said, the lighter weight Panasonic MC 4620 cannister that I tried out as a replacement one for upstairs day-to-day cleaning, made it clear that the Windtunnel is doing a much better job at getting the pet hair up than the Panasonic ever would.  Would I buy the Windtunnel again?  Maybe, now that I have reviewed all the alternatives again.  I am sad that they discontinued the Dyson DC18 slim, which seemed like a good compromise between weight and quality.  I just bought the Electrolux Commercial Sanitaire Upright based on Amazon reviews, so will let you know how it does.
Windtunnel PROS:
-  good at getting pet hair up
-  good suction (still after 2 years with a golden retriever who sheds)
-  fairly easy to clean out
-  controls on handle
-  works on both rugs and hardwoods
-  good price point for quality
CONS:
-  VERY HEAVY to point of back/neck pain
-  Powerhead seems to have broken (this is a common complaint per other reviewers)
-  Mini turbo attachment is broken after 2 years
-  awkward to store and carry from room to room

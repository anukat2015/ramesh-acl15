Title: Decent Space Heater
Content:
This is a very good space heater for the price.  I live alone in a small apartment, so I'm able to have the heater fairly close to me all the time.  I'm not sure how it would fair for a larger family in a larger space as a central heater.  I've only had it for about 2 weeks, so I can't comment on how much I'm saving right now; I can say that I have turned my thermostat all the way down to 64 degrees and just use the space heater...so the savings should be fairly noticeable.  I would have to say that a few days ago I went to turn on the space heater and it wouldn't turn on; I thought it was broken for a minute.  I then noticed the reset instructions on the back.  Once I turned off the heater and unplugged it for a few hours it started working just fine.
Overall I'd say this is a great heater for a small apartment...

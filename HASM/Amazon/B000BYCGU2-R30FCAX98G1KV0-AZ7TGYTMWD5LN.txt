Title: Excellent Machine - Fears Unfounded
Content:
After researching online, I purchased this coffee maker at a local store for the same price.
We are very pleased with the quality of the machine and the coffee it makes.  Used for about a month and have never experienced any of the concerns posted on this long list of reviews.  The machine makes excellent coffee and does so consistently.  Our typical dark roast coffees taste great but what surprised me the most was the flavor found in lighter roast coffees - they seemed more alive and nuanced than I'd ever appreciated before.  
All the other negatives mentioned here - spilling, hard to use, ergo - have not been observed.  It's not hard to use at all and I'd definitely recommend.

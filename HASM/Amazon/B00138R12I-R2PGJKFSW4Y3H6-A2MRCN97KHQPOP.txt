Title: LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
Content:
I received this as a Christmas present. Within 3 days of having this camera I had taken almost 600 pictures. I have owned many cameras (pentex, kodak, etc... ) NONE were this good. You really have to try to get a blurry picture. I was changing the zoom and took a pic and it still came out clear. I tried everything and kept it on the auto setting for type of pics and it was always clear. I am not a camera buff and it will take me some time to learn all the features, but so far so good. I would highly recommend this to someone without a lot of picture taking knowledge that just wants a good camera like I did.

Title: Best Device Technology Has To Offer
Content:
The last time I used Apple computers was somewhere in the 80s then the whole barrage of PCs took over. What a difference it made through the years. Like the others, have been using PCs and Microsoft basically that almost forgot how I missed this innovation. Every time I use my Macbook I can't stop smiling by the ease and conception of every function it is capable of. Here are some points:
Pros:
-The design concept is truly amazing
-You can run 2 OS linear or parallel using Desktop Parallel 5.0 or Fusion
-Blazing fast, I haven't upgraded mine yet (plan to increase memory) but it is very fast in every way
-Included software fits every need no matter what your background is
-Gorgeous LED display
-Core 2 Duo processor is very efficient and reliable
-Quiet operation and barely gets warm
-Larger hard drive than the Pro version
-Insane 7 hr battery life, Netbooks have 10 hr battery life but is limited in what it can do
-Included software is very functional to every need
-Very light
-User friendly 
-Tutorials available on Apple site
-Boots up in approx 20 seconds and shuts down in 5 seconds
-Glass mouse has a myriad of functions not available in PCs
Cons:
-Non user removable battery (although you can charge it up to 1,000x)
-Additional software and accessories could be very expensive
-Dirt magnet
-USB ports could be more
-People are complaining about the missing firewire port but my Sony HD cam uses a regular usb connection when transferring AVCHD video files. Besides, firewire speed is rated at 400mbps while USB 2.0 is 480mbps.
I just purchased Desktop Parallel 5.0 to add flexibility in handling Microsoft apps and operation, still thinking whether to install Windows 7 or XP but definitely not Vista. I bought mine from Bestbuy and it came with a $150 gift card so it's like I just paid $849. I wanted the regular white Macbook because it has a larger hard drive and I heard the aluminum unibody case dents easily. I am planning to use my Macbook for our church website construction even if we have an existing one I made through a PC software, the iWeb feature using MobileMe is just too nice to ignore. I'm planning to get an iMac next time for my 2 girls.

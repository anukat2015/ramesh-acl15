Title: Worst laptop!
Content:
Had problems with this laptop from day 1. Motherboard crashed after a few months and after that the system clock needed a replacement. Lasted 3 years half of which were spent sending it to BestBuy where they added a virus to my laptop. After talking to Dell they said that I should've sent it directly to them, which I ended up doing anyway. Received my laptop and after a few months one of the screen's holders began to come off with all the screws, etc. Next thing I knew the hard drive crashed. I have never had these many problems with a laptop before. Do not make the same mistake I made in buying this junk. Also, I bought the special edition version which provided a bigger battery and more memory. Worst laptop. Never buying anything Dell again.

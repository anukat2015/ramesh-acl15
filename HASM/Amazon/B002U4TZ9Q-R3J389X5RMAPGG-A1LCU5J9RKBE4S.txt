Title: Ugh - Would not buy it again...
Content:
I have a little Toshiba that is 12 years old, so thought I would love another Toshiba. Perhaps I would, but not THIS laptop. I wanted something smaller, so that part is my bad.  I wanted something lighter, and it isn't as light as I thought. It does have a DVD so that is good.
The pad is hard to use, too sensitive, and you can't "tone it down" - the cursor jumps all over the page to places unknown and I'm not even using it!  I thought attaching the mouse would be "the answer" even though that sort of defeats the purpose of having a laptop.  The mouse attaches at the side, so the mouse cord is always in the way.  Irritating. And when you type, getting close to the pad makes the cursor jump out of where you are typing, so you have to go find it and kidnap it back to your app.
Window's 7 isn't near as wonderful as advertised. Windows 95 was a whole lot better, so why to they keep mucking it up?  
All in all, I like the 12 year old one better even if it is heavier - at least it is smaller. I hate this new one.

Title: Excellent unit
Content:
Sometimes less is more. 
I had a $55 Vordao unit that I liked but some of the features (switches and knobs) started to break after only a year and a half of use. So I (unwisely) bought a $150 Vornado unit with electronic temperature control thinking that the quality of the more expensive unit would be better. WRONG! That one lasted me about 2 months before the fan just stopped working.
So instead of dropping big money on another heater, I went with this unit from Holmes since it had great reviews on Amazon and was only $44.
I've had it for 5 months it has worked perfectly so far. It's a little less powerful than the Vornado models I owned, but not by much. I'm in a northern state and use it to keep the family room in my basement warm when in use during the winter, and it definitely gets the job done. It doesn't allow you to adjust the temperature like the Vornados, but I find the temperature of the air that it blows out to be ideal, and you can simply position it further or closer from the area you want it to heat or face it in different directions in order to keep the area at an your desired temperature. It's also much quieter than the Vornados. 
Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.

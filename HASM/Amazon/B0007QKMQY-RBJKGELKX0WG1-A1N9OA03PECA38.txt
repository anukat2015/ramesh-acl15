Title: I love this camera
Content:
This camera is my first venture into high quality digital photography.  I have been using 35 mm SLR cameras for over 40 years.  
I am really impressed!  While this is not Canon's or anyone elses top of the line, it is a great choice for an amteur or semi-professional photographer.
I have been a technical writer, so I need photos both in color and B&W.  With 35 mm film SLR, I always carried two - one with color and one with black and white film.  With the Digital Rebel, I can take both color and B&W with a single camera - a real plus.  Since a lot of my photos have been taken in a manufacturing plant or in the field, I like the image stabilized EF lenses and the ability to select either aperture or shutter priority - and let the camera thoose the appropriate shutter speed or aperture.  And if I want complete control, that is available as well.

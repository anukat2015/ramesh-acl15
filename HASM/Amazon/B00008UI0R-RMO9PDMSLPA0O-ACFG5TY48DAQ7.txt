Title: The best of the best
Content:
I absolutely love this vac. I did a lot of research before buying and this one sounded the best.I use it almost daily and has more suction than any I have used. My last 2 vacs I paid over $1,000 for and they weren't as good as this one. The dust cup is small but I empty it after each use and I think that is part of the reason for the great suction power. I does a great job on my furniture also. The wand is a little heavy but it is just so easy to use that I don't care about that. LOVE IT.

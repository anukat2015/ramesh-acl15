Title: Great Thermal Coffee Maker with Timer!
Content:
I received this coffee maker VERY fast!  I had broken my old glass Mr. Coffee and wanted to replace it with a thermal-carafe unit.  It arrived in great condition and the set-up was very easy.  I didn't realize that it came with a charcoal water filter that is so convenient to use and change.  It also comes with a permanent washable filter in case I run out of paper filters.  I found that I need to fill the water mark a little over the actual amount of coffee I desire, but once I figured that out, I was able to make my coffee the night before and have a quick hot cup the next morning when I went into the kitchen!  I'd definitely recommend this to others, and the customer service was excellent.

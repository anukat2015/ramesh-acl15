Title: Does its job
Content:
I've been using this Sunbeam bathroom heater for about a month now with no problems.  This is the first bathroom heater I've ever owned, so I unfortunately don't have anything to compare it to.  
With that said, I purchased this solely for use in my small bathroom since it gets quite chilly in there, and so far it's kept it nice and warm. :)    I think the heater is a bit noisy, but on the other hand...at least I'm not cold!
As other reviewers have said, the clock resets every time the heater is unplugged, though I haven't had a need for it yet.  I've tested out the functions, like the timer, stay on, fan, and the digital thermostat, all of which work great.  Also, when you turn the power off while it's still running, it switches to fan mode and counts down from 10 seconds before turning off.
During the initial use, there IS a rather strong plastic smell but it seems to gradually dissipate with use, though I may just be getting used to it.

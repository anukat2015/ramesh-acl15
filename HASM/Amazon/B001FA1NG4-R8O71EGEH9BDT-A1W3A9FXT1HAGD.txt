Title: Thank You Apple
Content:
I had originally posted a less than glowing review for the new Ipod Nano based simply on what we can describe now as the old "cover-flow problem". Well, now I know that when I bought my new Ipod, I wasn't simply getting a good product, but a company that listens to it's customers. I didn't like one of the software design aspects to the product (a lot of people didn't), so Apple listened, and now I feel better about being an Ipod owner. Now everyone can head into the holiday season not having to worry that their Ipod will function differently than how it used to. Additionally, if you like the new interface, you can keep it, Apple just gave people the option to choose. Great move Apple, and as I said, I've removed my less favorable review and replaced it with this, because Apple listened.

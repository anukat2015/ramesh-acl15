Title: Perfect heater for my 1BR apt in SoCal
Content:
This little heater is just right for keeping my bedroom toasty at night during the winter in Los Angeles. I save quite a bit of money by turning off the gas heating in the main room of the apartment and only heating the bedroom with this little DeLonghi. It's relatively quiet, but not silent. One thing to know - if you want to open it to clean it, you're going to need a phillips head screwdriver AND a torx screwdriver - the star shaped one (if you want to wipe the blades, for example). Great price, by the way.

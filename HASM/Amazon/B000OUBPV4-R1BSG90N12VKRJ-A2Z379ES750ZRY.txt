Title: Looks like it is now officially discontinued.
Content:
Much improved over the previous version S3 Pro in terms of ease of use.
The larger display screen is nice and the menu is much improved.
Although the AA batteries of the previous version had its advantages, I prefer the lithion ion battery system of this version.
The actual results is not that much of an improvement -- pixel count and ccd sizes remain the same.

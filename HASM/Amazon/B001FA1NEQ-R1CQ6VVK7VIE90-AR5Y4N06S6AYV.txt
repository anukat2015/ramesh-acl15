Perfect.
Love my baby.
Let's see how long it lasts.
Also the best companion to work out.
Hate the original ear buds, bought new ones, smaller, since the originals hurt my ears, *too big I suppose*, the new ones are silicone ear buds got them at a store stand in a mall, for less than 13 bucks, decent sound and really comfortable.
my brother also for rid of his original Ipod Classic ear buds, he hated them.

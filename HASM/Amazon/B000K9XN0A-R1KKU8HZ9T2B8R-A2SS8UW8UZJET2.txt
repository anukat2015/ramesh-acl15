Title: Finally some hot coffee.
Content:
I am very happy with this product. For $30.00 I didn't expect it to be brand new, but it either is or is as close to new as it can get. The size is great, not as wide as the pot it replaced, so it takes up less room on my counter. It doesn't have a warming plate so it uses less electricity because it shuts off after the coffee is done brewing. Also, without a warming plate the coffee doesn't continue to cook as it sits. The thermal carafe is well made and heavy. Yesterday, I poured a cup 10 hours after being brewed and it tasted the same as the first cup and the temp was hotter than the second cup out of my old coffeemaker. I also like the fact that I can take the whole pot to the table or outside to the patio. I have one suggestion for an added feature. I would like an indicator light for the Auto Brew feature to let you know at a glance that it is set. Right now you have to look very closely at the LCD screen to see the very, very tiny "Auto" spelled out on the upper right side. Outside of that, I'm very please with this purchase and highly recommend it to others.

Title: Awesome space heater
Content:
If you are looking for a space heater to heat up your room, this is not your product. This is not a "room heater" it is a "space heater." It will sufficiently heat up a SPACE in your room. I use it under my desk (only when I am sitting at my desk, of course) and I only need to use the 400Watt setting. It gets too hot even, sometimes. A great energy saver compared to those 1500Watt systems that don't even heat as well. I don't use a house heater and live in the cold city of San Francisco.

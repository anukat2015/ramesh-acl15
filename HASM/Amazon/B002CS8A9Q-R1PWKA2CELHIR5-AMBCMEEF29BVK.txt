Title: Works great, but you'll need a couple of tricks...
Content:
Makes good coffee.  I have to watch my caffeine and acid levels (I had a gastric bypass) so I use 50/50 caf/decaf beans with a coarse burr grinder. Better coffee bean quality does make a difference.  It also makes convenient super great healthy iced coffee with skim milk and stevia sweetner.  
I also had a problem with leaking and locking at first but there are a couple of tricks that work for me.  First, after you fill with water gently screw the base together. Carefully leave the top part a little loose.  The problem I found was that if you screw the thing tightly together right after you add the water, the water is still absorbing into the grounds and will create a powerful vacuum over time!  So if you seal it up tight right away, over time the whole thing locks down tight!  I am a big guy but still could barely open the thing after 24 hour cycle!  Just leave it loose, just enough for the whole thing to stay together and 24 hours later you'll be fine.  This seems to also alleviate some of the leaking problems too because when you do tighten it down the seal will be fresher (if that makes sense).  You may get an occasional drip after that but you will learn to be careful and pour CAREFULLY into the bean canteen over a sink.  I have very few dripping issues now.
I do wish it were less expensive.

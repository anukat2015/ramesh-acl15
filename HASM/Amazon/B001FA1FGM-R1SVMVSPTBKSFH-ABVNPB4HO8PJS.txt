Title: Sunbeam works great, but the "power problem"
Content:
I bought one of these 2 years ago for an unheated attic and it worked great...still use it up there.  A few months ago, after receiving my heating bill(!), I went and got another one.  After a couple of weeks, it stopped working, so I returned it, and got a new one.  It worked, then didn't, then did, then didn't.  Coming on here, reading "Bill" in Vail's comments, I tried the emery board to the plug.  Plugged it back in...and it works again!  For all those that are looking for a space heater, this is the one to buy.  I paid $60 at Lowes for the first one, and the same for the second at Walmart.  Just remember about the power plug problem if it happens.  It's not a hard problem to fix.

Title: Not quite hot enough
Content:
This carafe style coffee maker resolves the problem of burnt tasting coffee common with coffee makers using a heating element.  And the carafe does a good job keeping the coffeee warm for an hour or two.  However, the initial coffee temperature is not quite as warm as I would like, even when hot water is used.  So I often find myself warming up the coffee with a 30 to 60 second jolt in the microwave.

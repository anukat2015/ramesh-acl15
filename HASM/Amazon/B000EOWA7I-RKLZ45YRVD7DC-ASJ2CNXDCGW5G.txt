Title: Good Buy
Content:
This is a good vac i decided to buy after comparing to various other high end products. I was thinking from only a car point of view. Its been a month and i have used it few times and it has done well. It does find it difficult to pull off dirt particles from the nooks but otherwise it is good. Easy to clean and put back in action. Mine had only a car battery connector, remember it will work only in the car and cannot be used with regular sockets in your kitchen and for other purposes.

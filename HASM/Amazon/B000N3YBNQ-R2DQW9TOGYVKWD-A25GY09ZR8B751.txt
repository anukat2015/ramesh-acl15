I loved this vacuum from the minute I pulled it out of the box (fully assembled).  I plugged it in and was ASTOUNDED at the power/suction.  The first time I used this machine, the bag filled up pretty quickly but as time went on, it took more and more time for the bag to fill up.  (Probably because once this machine was used, it cleaned down deep and pulled up dirt that had been there for awhile that I didn't see - and believe me, I'm a fanatic about clean carpets).  Because of it's smaller size and the ability to fold down, I tend to grab the vacuum more often.  It's not heavy and can be carried up the stairs easily. For a machine that's not "power" driven, it's not hard to push/pull at all.  Yes, it does grab fringe on space carpeting - but that's the same with any vacuum.  It comes with no gadgets but quite honestly - I don't miss that - I used a hand held for the stairs, sides corners.  It's a GREAT buy!

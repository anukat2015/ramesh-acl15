Title: This Is So Small But Has Plenty Power That You Won't Believe....
Content:
This is unbelievably small and it looks like a little toy too, but when it's in business, it really means it!!! Very quiet but has so much power. I am using it in my bathroom and it just fits anywhere perfectly.  I also purchased a tower heater (Lasko 751320) for my bedroom and it is powerful too.  What a great find!!!!

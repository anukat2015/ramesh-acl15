Title: Works as it Should
Content:
I bought this a few months ago and have used it to warm up an otherwise unheated basement room.  Since there is no direct heating in the room at all, and the room is below ground, it tends to get fairly cold in the winter.  While the space heater doesn't make it just like one of the upstairs rooms, it certainly takes the chill off and being in that room is no longer so unpleasant.  I was especially interested in the safety feature [the self-contained heating unit] and it works as it should.

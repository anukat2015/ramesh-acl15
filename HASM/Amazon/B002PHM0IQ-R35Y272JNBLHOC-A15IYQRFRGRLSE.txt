Title: Nice out of the box experience
Content:
I needed a computer. My old box simply wouldn't turn-on following the move to my new apartment. Why? I don't know. Flipped the switch, no power, so I bought a new power supply, installed it and that's all I got was power; nothing on the lcd screen and two greens, a yellow and a red from my gigabyte MB. Okay, so now what? I have always been a desktop fan as they are faster, run cooler and easy to swap components. But I figure laptops are finally coming into their own and occasionally I need portable computing. Besides, I can port out the video to my monitor, get a wireless keyboard, so I don't mess up the laptop with a coffee spill or some ashes from my smokes. 
So which one? Acer is out there, cheap and well-configured; ASUS is well-received. For some reason I wouldn't consider an HP. Toshiba, tried and true, it's true, but nah for some reason. Then I see this Sony and others from the CW series. Heretofore, Sonys have been beyond my price point, but it looks like they want to capture more of the low end market by introducing this line. Looks nice, colors and all. Plus, it's got everything I wanted: portability as it's right around 5 lbs, a banging screen as you'd expect from Sony, 4 gigs of RAM which is more than I expected. I also expected and got good workmanship. There are a lot of crappy laptops coming off Chinese assembly lines these days. 
The out of the box experiecne was perfect. Turned it on and I was ready to rock n roll. And so far, so good. I probably could have gotten more for the buck, a faster chip and a bigger hard drive, but I got what I needed and I got it fast so I'm not complaining.

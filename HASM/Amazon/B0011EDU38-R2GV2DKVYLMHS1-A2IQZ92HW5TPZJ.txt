Title: Suck-less
Content:
This vacuum is light weight and handy, but if you want a vacuum that sucks dirt up from carpet, this is not your vacuum!!  Mine sucks dirt from hardwood floors just fine, but I have to vacuum about ten times in the same place on carpet for it to pick up fluffy stuff.  It makes a great carpet sweeper though because the brushy thingys inside the nozzle thingy brush the cat hair and stuff off the carpet real well ... they just don't get sucked up after that, they wipe back off in another place on the carpet ...   :)

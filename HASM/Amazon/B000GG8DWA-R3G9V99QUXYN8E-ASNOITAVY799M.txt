Title: Good for small room
Content:
No noise since there is no fan. Warms small room. 
Note that when used in night, it also acts as a night light since it will light the room.
The control dial is awkward. It has two "OFF" positions in the full circle. From one "OFF" position, no matter which direction you turn, you will get to the "800W" mode. And from the other "OFF" position, no matter which direction you turn, you will get to the "400W" mode. This design has two problems:
- If you switch between 400W and 800W from time to time, you will have to look at the dial to determine how many clicks you need to turn to get to the mode you want. And in night, you'll have to wait till it lights up to see which mode you turn it to.
- If you are at the OFF position next to 400W, and want to turn to 800W, you'll have to turn two clicks away to pass the 400W. And vise versa. 
It's not a big deal but it is somehow very strange and counter-intuitive design.

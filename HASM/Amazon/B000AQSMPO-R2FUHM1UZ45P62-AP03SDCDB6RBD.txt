Title: Fast, Easy and great cup of coffee whenever you want it...however, mechanics are terrible.
Content:
I like the convenience of getting of cup of coffee or tea whenever you want without making a whole pot.  Also having the different flavors available for a change of pace.  However, I've about had it with the mechanics of these coffee makers.  I've had 3 Keurig B50-B60 model coffee makers in less than 2 years.  Each one breaking down.  This last one, the B60 I bought in June 09.  I use filtered water, descale it when needed and use the recommended filter  that you place inside the water resevoir holder (changed every 2-4 weeks depending on usage).  However, the machine gets clogged, sputters, doesn't work when you press the coffee button, drips only...or just plain makes alot of noise and nothing happens when you press for a cup of coffee. Personally, I'm tired of paying $150 for a coffee maker that last 6 months or less.  It's bad enough the k-cups are not the cheapest.  But I buy them because I like the coffee.  NO MORE...I'm seriously thinking of going back to the POT. Any suggestions on how to make it work? Went to the Keurig site, but they only want to sell you coffee, not help you with their inferior product.

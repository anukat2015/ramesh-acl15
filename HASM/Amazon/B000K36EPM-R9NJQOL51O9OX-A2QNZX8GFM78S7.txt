Title: Coffee cool within 20 minutes
Content:
We purchased this 6 weeks ago. Our coffee must be microwaved if brewed 20 minutes before drinking. They recommend warming carafe with hot water before brewing. However, if you use the carafe to pour in cool water for brewing you then need to fill the carafe with hot water and let it sit 10 minutes or so to heat carafe, pour out water and then start brewing - no thank you! Also that doesn't work at all if you want to delay brew. I called customer service and they said to try removing carafe from coffee maker after brewing. Apparently, if it sits on the plate ( which doesn't get warm) the top stays open allowing your coffee to cool. This is not mentioned in the instruction book. Total waste of money for our family.

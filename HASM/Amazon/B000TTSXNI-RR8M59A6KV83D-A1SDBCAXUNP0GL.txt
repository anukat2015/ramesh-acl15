Title: Great product.  Worth its fee and more.
Content:
Highly recommended product.  I am giving it 5*.  Beautiful design and very powerful. It warms the big room in no time.  It has many pro points as it takes no space to store, swivel, have automatic timer.  You can plan it up to 7 hours (which is very useful in the night) and will shut off automatically.  Plus comes with remote control so you don't need to wake up to open or close it during the night. What could you ask more from a heater?! I considered that it is worth more than its price. I know you enjoy it and utilize it a lot.  I do.
Thus, have a warm winter.

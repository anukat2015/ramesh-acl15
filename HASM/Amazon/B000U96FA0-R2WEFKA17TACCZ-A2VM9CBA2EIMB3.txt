Title: LOVE IT!
Content:
This heater is AMAZING! Its around 40-50 bucks and works great. I reccomend it to anyone! The remote control is awesome, you can pick high or low the machine rotates if you want it too. My first one lasted 2-3 years and it died and I ran and bought another one. Even if it only lasts a year its WORTH it, since I keep it on all day (well not when I am at work) but at work I have one as well. This Heater is the best by far and trust me Ive had my share of heaters. Its also pretty cool looking :)

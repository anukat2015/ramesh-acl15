Title: Money not well spent.
Content:
I bought this camera almost a year ago, since I bought this camera it's been in repair 2 times.
First time zoom for LCD Monitor stopped working. I sent it to Canon repair center. I have to say that camera was fixed very quickly.
But i never got a reasonable explanation why zoom button wasn't working.
A few months later my camera couldn't read memory card and also couldn't format it.
So i sent it back to Canon repair center.
I like this camera. I don't abuse it but it brakes. I paid a lot of money for this camera and seeing it getting broken 2 times is not pleasant.
I think I would be better of with Nikon.
I have Panasonic Camera and i had it for over 8 years and I never had a problem with it and i paid for it $700.
Why can't make their products durable as Panasonic?

Title: Great deal, love the fan!
Content:
We live in North Central Florida. In a cost cutting measure we bought this fan to use when the air outside is not too hot. It pulls the air through the whole place and really does make it more comfortable. We open a window at both ends of the place and it exchanges the stuffy inside air with the fresh outside air. This makes it only necessary to run the AC during the hottest part of the day. Great money saver. We love it.
It would be nice if we could have it made out of metal instead of plastic, but this is what we found available.
Highly recommend it.

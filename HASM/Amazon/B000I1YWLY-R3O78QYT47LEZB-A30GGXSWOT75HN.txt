Title: Best vacuum I have ever owned !
Content:
After reading all the reviews I was a little apprehensive. This vacuum seemed to have problems with dying soon after buying. I decided to chance it anyway.
It seems as though problems had occurred when it was left plugged in after use, so I have always unplugged it.
This is the most amazing vacuum. I have always thought I had a very clean home, always take shoes off in house etc. The first time I used it I had to empty the canister three times on just one small carpet. It practically pulls itself along, and I have finally been able to vacuum under my bed.
one word to describe this amazing machine "awesome"

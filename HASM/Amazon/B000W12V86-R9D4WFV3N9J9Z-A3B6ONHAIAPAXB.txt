Title: HP Pavilion DV9623CL refurbished laptop
Content:
I bought this refurbished laptop at a really good price, $700 USD.  It had a lot of features at this price, including two 120gb hard drives, 17" widescreen, bluetooth, media center remote, a decent dual core processor and 2gb of ram.  
I had never previously bought a refurbished product before, but it was in pretty much brand new condition and functioned like new.  For the price, you would be hard pressed to find something with these sort of specs.
The laptop itself runs smoothly for office applications, and web browsing.  Although the graphics card has no dedicated memory, Solidworks runs fine with larger 3D models.  There was also no problems running Adobe Creative suite.  
Although I would imagine the laptop would not be perfect for high end gaming due to the graphics card being fairly standard, but then again I would just buy a console or a desktop for the price difference anyway. 
So in summary:
pro's:
-Excellent laptop for the price
-Excellent for everyday office use and good enough for 3D applications and ram intensive programs such as photoshop.   
-Widescreen has heaps of screen real estate
-Media center capabilities and remote
-Decent battery life
-Looks damn good
con's:
-Have not tested with high end games, but most probably not suitable with no dedicated graphics memory
-Vista is a little slow on start up, but once you delete a few programs and clean it up, the laptop is a dream
Overall I would highly recommend this laptop for everyone, except maybe the hardcore gamer.  But then again the hardcore gamer would not be looking at a laptop at this price, rather one that is a lot more expensive.  I am a transport designer so have used a range of programs at home and at the office and the laptop has been reliable and a real pleasure to have.

Title: Horrible Navigation features & then Broke immediately - HORRIBLE!!
Content:
This product broke on me with in 2 days and I never dropped it or anything. The navigation is borderline nonfunctional. This thing is straight from a cheap manufacturer, that was so embarassed of their product that, you simply can not find out who made it. There is no name brand on the product or the packaging. The touch screen is unresponsive too.

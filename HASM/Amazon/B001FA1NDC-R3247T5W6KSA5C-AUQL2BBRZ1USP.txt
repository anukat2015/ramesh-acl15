Title: trash
Content:
battery life claimed to be  24 hours....
i have never even seen 4 hours....i get about two trips to the gym with it before i have to recharge it
i was going to get the car charger but people are saying that they arent compatible with 16 gb ipod nano 4th generation?? is there any car charger that i can purchase which will reliably and effectively charge my ipod? if so, ill bump my review up to three, but this product is glitched, to say the least....
REVISED: i have since obtained a USB to mini USB adapter with my itrip, and, when used in conjunction with my ipod charger, charges my ipod while it plays via radio frequency in my car....i said i would bump it up to three stars, but for the amount of money i spent to suit the ipod to my needs: (20 for charger, 45 for itrip, 30 for arm strap, 15 for headphones) i would say this is no more than a two star product....and the ear buds that come with the ipod? do these actually fit in anyone's ears? not mine, thats for sure

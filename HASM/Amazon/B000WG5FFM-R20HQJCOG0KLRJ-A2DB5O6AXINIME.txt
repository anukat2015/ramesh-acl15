Title: The ZUNE ROCKS !
Content:
I won the Zune 8GB thru the Pepsi Points sweepstakes, I own a Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20GB which holds my entire music collection, so the Zune is my work/exercise/take everywhere MP3 player. 
The Zune is an excellent MP3 player, the unit itself is well built, it's controls are common sense, the FM tuner works well, the volumune range is good and the overall high end is higher than most MP3's. The sound quality is good, unlike the Creative player I own, the Zune doesn't have a EQ, but the sound is good. The software is very good and easy too use. This MP3 player comes with WiFi built in, although I have yet too use it. Charging the zune is done thru the sync cord via the USB on your computer, and fully charges in about three hours, and battery life is great, I work 9-10 hour days and use both FM tuner and music library all days long and the battery has never dipped below half way. The only downside I can think of is this......with my Creative player which is hard drive based, the music downloads are quick, 4 CD's in under a minute, with the Zune which is Flash (memory based) the downloads are much slower. The upside to the Flash based player is that battery life is much greater.
All things considered, I highly reccomend the Zune.

Title: Feels like a radiator
Content:
I bought this heater to heat the 400 sq.ft. second floor of my 100-year-old house. I have hot water radiators that heat the first floor just fine, but the old boiler has a difficult time getting the water all the way up to the second floor so I have used fan style space heaters for years. I decided to upgrade to this convection heater and cannont believe the difference. It heats the entire second floor fairly evenly and does not dry the air like the fan heaters did. It looks nice too, which is a nice added bonus. I would recommend it to anyone looking to supplement their heating system.

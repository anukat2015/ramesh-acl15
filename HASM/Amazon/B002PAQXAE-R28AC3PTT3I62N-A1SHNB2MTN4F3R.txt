Title: Simply Outstanding in every way.
Content:
We've had this laptop for about a month or so.  Right away we put in the extra 2 GB memory chip.  This thing is very light & portable and blows away our desktop in terms of performance.  Battery life is good, we typically get about 4-5 hours using the Windows 7 balanced power option.  Windows 7 has been very impressive as well.  The chiclet style keyboard has proven to be easy to type on.  
Overall a great laptop & would most definitely purchase again & highly recommend.

Title: Ineffective cooler - SPT SF-610
Content:
I purchased the SPT SF-610 from a local retailer on 1 July 2009 and returned it on 5 July.
This item has many nice features but it is not a good cooler.
I used it at different times of the day with the temperature ranging between 75°F and 106°F; it did not offer any cooling effect when the temperature was over 85°.
The motor is quiet but the fan running at medium or high is rather noisy.

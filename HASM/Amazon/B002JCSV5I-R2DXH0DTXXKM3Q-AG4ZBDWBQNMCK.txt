Title: Nikon is the Best
Content:
I own a significant collection of Nikon 35mm cameras and lens and in my move to digital equipment there was no other choice except to continue with Nikon. Once you become familar with the Nikon System, no other photographic system measures up. The D3000 provides that same confidence. The camera is of excellent manufacturing Quality and the design is superb. Just pick the camera up and it handles as an extension of yourself and just falls right into proper position for taking outstanding pictures. The menues are are intutive and are very easy to read. Even for a beginner in digital photography, the camera will virtually assure that you will take outstanding pictures. If you are a beginner in digital SLR photography, buy this camera. You will not be disappointed.

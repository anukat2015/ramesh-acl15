Title: excellent buy!
Content:
I found the Nikon d40 to be a great beginner's DSLR. I have used it so much since I bought it about 3 weeks ago. My pictures come out great compared to my point and shoot canon sd200. I brought it along on my trip to san francisco and the nikon d40 was quick to capture the moments that i wanted. i would definitely recommend this camera to anyone just starting out with DLSRs.

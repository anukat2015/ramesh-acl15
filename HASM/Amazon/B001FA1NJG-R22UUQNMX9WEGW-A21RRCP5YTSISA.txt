Title: I Love My Zune
Content:
I have had this Zune for 9-10 months and I absolutely love it. I've had not problems with it and it has the perfect amount of space. I have well over 60 gigs of music in my collection that is constantly growing and about 30 gigs of movies.  This coupled with the A/V charger and docking station are great.  The only thing I  wish the Zune had was an equalizer in its settings, but that's the audio tech in me being critical.

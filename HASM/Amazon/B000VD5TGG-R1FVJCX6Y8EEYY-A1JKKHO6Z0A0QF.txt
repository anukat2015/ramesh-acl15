Title: Bissell 7700 Big Green
Content:
This machine is exactly what I needed & it performs.  I bought it for one reason, to steam clean my two staircases & one carpeted room. The steam hose & attachments are sized perfectly & work on all my areas.  Only critical comment is about the water level shut-off float -- it tends to come up prematurely & turn off the suction.  This is easily solved by removing the float & watching the water level.

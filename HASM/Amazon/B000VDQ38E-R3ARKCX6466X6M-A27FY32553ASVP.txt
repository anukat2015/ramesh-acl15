Title: Best in quite some time
Content:
We've now had the Bissell 3920 "Pet Hair Eraser" for a few weeks and are totally satisfied with performance.  We had a Hoover WindTunnel for about two years, but for the past several months had noticed that it was not picking up the pet hair (two cats) to the extent desired.  It wasn't that the suction was clogged or the motor damaged, it had just never fully performed as expected.  That said, we'd had a DirtDevil before the Hoover and were even more dissatisfied.  So the move to a Hoover seemed a step up.
The first use of the Bissell was amazing.  Less than a week after the Hoover had covered the same carpet area, the Bissell came away with a totally unexpected amount of hair, grit, etc.  We couldn't have been more pleased (except for the fact that we had been settling for sub-performance of the other vacuume for so long.)  Since that time, we have also used the attachments for cleaning the upholstery and they, too, have performed at or above expectations.
It's not the lightest piece of equipment around, but it's still fairly easily taken up and down stairs.  Overall, however, from our perspective this was a great purchase and one we would easily recommend to others.

Title: this product does not work ( I cannot rate less than one star)
Content:
Looks and weight 10, heating 0 :  I believed the promotional tag on the heater.  It is the worst space heater I have ever purchased.  I had an oil heater that looked like an old fashion hot water heater, not very pretty, and haeavy, but it heated circles around this product.  I thought the remote control feature was good since you could set by temperature setting as well as high and low.  Sadly this unit does almost nothing.  Save your money, and stay away from this product. I just don't know what this heater is good for.

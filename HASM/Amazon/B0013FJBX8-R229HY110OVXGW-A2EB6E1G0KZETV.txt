Title: Macbook Pro is awesome
Content:
My first ever Apple, and it is sweet.  It took a short time for me to get used to OS X, but it's awesome.  Boot up and restarts are the fastest I've seen, far faster than Windows based PCs.  The notebook itself is pleasing to the eye, just aesthetically gorgeous.  I have no problems with the display being reflective.  I love how it is so thin and the backlit keyboard.  I'm loving every bit of my new MBP!  
For almost $2K, the MBP's lack of HDMI, Blu Ray, and 1600 x 900 display makes me give it 4.5 stars.

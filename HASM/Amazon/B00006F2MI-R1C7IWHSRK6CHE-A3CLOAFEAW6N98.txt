Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I received this as a wedding gift and thought it would be the answer to my problems.  No more separate grinding.  NOT THE CASE.  First of all - the coffee is never hot at all.  Who likes room temperature coffee?  Next, the cup for the beans is so small it never makes strong coffee ever.  When I make a full pot of coffee I fill up the cup with beans and also use ground coffee in the filter.  I have had this machine for about two years now and on two separate occasions (only when company was over) did I have to go rescue my countertop from grinds and coffee all over it.  What a nightmare.

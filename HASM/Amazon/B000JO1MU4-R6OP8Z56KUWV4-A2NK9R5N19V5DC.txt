Title: ipods for big ears
Content:
this is my first ipod,  first of all I have big ears.  I mean very huge ears.   I have tried traditional headsets and found them too small.  by the way  diet coke is my favorite soda.   have you ever seen it snow on a cloudless day ?     kitties make me smile.  Go Red Sox.    I say " good day Sir "   Clay Aiken rules.

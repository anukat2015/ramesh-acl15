Title: Hoover will do
Content:
I needed an inexpensive canister vacuum for my summer house. This little Hoover is a price performer. It is rather loud especially in enclosed areas such as closets, but the noise is evidently a byproduct of it's power. Tons of suction and a pretty useful beater bar. You can easily switch from beater to straight suction with a touch of the toe. The tools are adequete, though small, again directing more powerful suction. The provided storage of the tools on the handle though does not work. The tools are always falling off and are in the way. The vacuum is lightweight and easy to manuever, why I've even placed it on the paint bucket rack of a ladder so I could reach some plant shelves 12 feet up!
It's lightweightedness does not allow the wand to stand up in storage.
I have a far more expensive canister with all the bells and whistles, though it offers a few more conveniences than this little Hoover, it cost 4 times as much.

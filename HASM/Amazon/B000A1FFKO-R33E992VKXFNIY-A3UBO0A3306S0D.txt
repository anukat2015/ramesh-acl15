Title: Proctor-Silex  Coffeemaker
Content:
The only complaint I have is when you pour the water in or pour a cup of coffee. The pour spout is too small and you have to pour slowly!! Sometimes that doesn't even work and I end up with paper towels moping up the counter top. I have bought this brand for years because it last longer than any coffee maker I have ever bought!!! If they fixed this problem it would be a perfect coffee maker!!!!!!!!

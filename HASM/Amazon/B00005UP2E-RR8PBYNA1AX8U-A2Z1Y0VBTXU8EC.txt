Title: Cute, but not effective
Content:
I recently purchased this vacuum. The attachments are cheap and it has a hard time picking up dirt off carpets. I do like the bagless canister, very easy to remove and empty. It is also a attractive vacuum, but if I were going to by another vacuum for $100 I would choose another type or buy a vacuum from Target and have the option to return if it doesn't do the job

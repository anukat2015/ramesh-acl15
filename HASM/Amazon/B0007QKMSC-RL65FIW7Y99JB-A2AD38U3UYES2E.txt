Title: Fantastic entry-level camera; will frustrate more advanced users.
Content:
Allow me to preface this review by saying that I love my little Rebel and would hate to part from it.   It was great when I was just learning how to deal with a dSLR - easy to use, simple controls, intuitive (much more so than the Nikon I use occasionally)...all-around a great little guy.
However, for the really serious photographer, it leaves some things to be desired.  The autofocus is slow, and faulty for dark places.  The ISO goes only to 1600, and even then the noise is nearly unmanageable.  1600 is not that great either - I am lucky that I have a f/1.8 lens.  There have been times where I have shot at f/1.8, 1/30, and still been underexposing by 2/3 of a stop.  Thank goodness for the RAW format!
For what it is, the Rebel is great.  Just don't expect it to be more.
Oh - and that 18-55 f/3.5-5.6?  it is a good thing to skip.  Get a 50mm f/1.8 instead, or a Sigma 17-70 f/2.8-4.5, or be like me and get an 85mm f/1.8.  All better lenses, and the 50mm is even less expensive.

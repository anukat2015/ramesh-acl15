Title: Works well, just  difficult to roll around
Content:
The suction power is nice.  Appears to pick up pretty much everything.  Dragging the canister around is not so easy - seems to catch on all the furniture.  I had an upright before - much easier to use.  The small canister is also only good for one round and is a bit messy when dumping.  That being said, this works great for the car and the stairs.  If you are looking for a canister vac or something for your car, this one is good.  If you are looking for a vacuum generally, an upright might be a bit easier to maneuver.

Title: Best purchase I have made.
Content:
My Macbook Pro is the greatest thing I have purchased in a long time. It is my first Mac and I absolutely love it. It is very easy to use and I was pretty familiar with everything within a week. I have been a PC user forever and this sudden switch made me realize how pointless a lot of the Windows based features are. Mac keeps it nice and simple. Integrated wireless access allows me to connect to the internet all around my college campus making it  very easy to get my work done in any place I wish. The Macbook Pro offers speed my gaming PC can't handle and it really comes in handy working in Digital Design. Speed, portability, simplicity, and great efficiency is what you get with the Macbook Pro.

Title: Fantastic storage, long battery, cheap!
Content:
It's all in the title. I bought this for only about $14 more than a 20 GB iPod and the audiophile I bought it for has not filled it yet! Have not stored photos on it yet but will be good to be able to show pictures to others when traveling as none are in the wallet. As for music, it's been used on international flights where the long battery life is a must. I have thought of buying a disposable one time charger for those flights that are severly delayed and boring! Forget the 20 GB, go for the 30 GB!

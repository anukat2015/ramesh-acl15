Title: Perfect Family Camera
Content:
When our last family camera died, we decided to take the plunge into digital SLRs.  We couldn't be more happy with the Nikon D40.  Because we are new to the world of SLRs, we wanted a camera that would work easily on auto settings  as we learn to customize our photo-taking skills.  Out of the box and working on full auto, this camera takes beautiful pictures (much better than our last point and shoot camera).  I can see that we will need to think about getting a zoom lens in the near future, but we are VERY pleased with this product!

Title: Going in the trash
Content:
Ditto to most of the reviews I have read.  I wanted a nice little 4-cup coffee maker, reviews seemed adequate and it looked attractive.  I CAN NOT LIVE WITH IT ANYMORE!!  You cannot pour water into the machine with the carafe.  You have to use something else or it pours all over the counter.  Same when you pour coffee.  Must be done over the sink or there's coffee all over the counter.  The pause and pour works 50% of the time,therefore more coffee on the counter.  The worst though is the taste.  I have tried every trick in the book to get rid of the metallic,horrid taste.  What is the use in drinking coffee when it tastes so horrible.  It is going in the trash today and something, anything will replace it.

Title: THREE MAJOR FLAWS
Content:
I've had this camera for about six months, and enjoy the freedom it gives me.  However, it has three major flaws.  The first is that whenever I am shooting continuously - usually on location - the on/off switch switches off without warning.  This is because of its location, to be sure.  The second is that even when I underexpose my shots several stops, the metering still blows out the highlights in most daytime pix.  And lastly, autofocus just doesn't work at night, and I have to manually focus.  So I really enjoy the pictures when I can take them...but that isn't always as easy as I would expect with this hardware.

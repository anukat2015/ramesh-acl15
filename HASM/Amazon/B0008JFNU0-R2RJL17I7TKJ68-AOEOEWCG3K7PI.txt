Title: Does not cool, more like a humidifier:(
Content:
Don't buy this thing unless you don't mind having to continuously put ice in it. Also, if you don't live in a desert it won't cool at all. Any moisture at all, forget about it. Just get an AC. I gave mine away, was just eating my space up. Total loss.

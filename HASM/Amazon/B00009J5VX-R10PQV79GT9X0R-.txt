Title: ipod 10 GB (win)-great gadget!
Content:
I am really not much for using computers except for emails and shopping but I was so impressed by the ipod with regards to its style and music capacity that I went ahead and purchased it!  I never downloaded music before so I knew it was going to be a major challenge.  I installed the firewire card as well as the program for the ipod which proved to be easy as pie but the music software was my biggest headache! It took me forever and a day to get it going.  Once I mastered it though- everything else just fell into place.  My ipod did freeze up a couple of times but other than that I am pleased with it.  Awesome sound, easy to use and the remote earphones is a must!

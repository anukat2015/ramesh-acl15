Title: Fine, but temp control increments too large
Content:
It's a fine product, brings temp up quickly,oscillation is a great idea. The main knock against it is that the temperature setting increments are 5 degrees; 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 then MAX. If they had made the increments smaller, grouped around the range between 65 and 75, then MAX, it would be better. For me, 65 too cool and 70 too warm. Otherwise, very good product.

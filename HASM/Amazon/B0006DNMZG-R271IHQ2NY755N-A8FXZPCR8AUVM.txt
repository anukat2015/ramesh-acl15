Title: Small space heater packs a big punch
Content:
I purchased this space heater for my Cambridge apartment a few weeks ago to combat the drafty chills typical of the older houses. The heater has three settings: fan, low, and medium, and a thermostat that is supposed to allow you to set just how warm you'd like your room to be. 
For a 10x12 foot room, this heater does a fine job of making the space toasty. My only complaint is that the fan is a bit on the noisy side. Not noisy enough to be too distracting when you're trying to work, but certainly acceptable.

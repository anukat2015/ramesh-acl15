Title: Great produst
Content:
This is my first canister vaccum and it does take some time to get used to pulling the canister while you vacuum. Said that this is by far the best vacuum i ever used. I have mostly wooden floors with few rugs, and some tile flooring. Swivel head and conector work real well. Suction works great even after few uses. And as far as replacement bags you can get them at walmart

Title: Exceeded my expectations
Content:
I had just returned my Melitta Grind and Brew after two days of use because the coffee came out so weak, that it looked like weak tea. I was at Costco and decided to give Cuisinart a try.  I read the negative reviews and was expecting an average product.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  The machine not only looks great, but it's easy to use and the coffee tastes like it came from Starbucks.  I am very impressed!!!!  Yes, there are more parts than to the Melitta, but at least you know you will get great coffee.  Try it.

Title: I Love this canister vacuum!
Content:
I am so pleased with this vacuum.  I have 3 fluffy long-haired cats who shed constantly.  I have a powerful upright vacuum that deep cleans but it is only ho-hum at getting up the cat hair and when trying to use the attachments with it, it falls over.  My new Electrolux does the job wonderfully and it handles so easily.  The cat hair comes up and dusting with it and using the attachments is a breeze.  The dust bags though are rather small but I can live with that.  On the whole, I am completely satisfied.

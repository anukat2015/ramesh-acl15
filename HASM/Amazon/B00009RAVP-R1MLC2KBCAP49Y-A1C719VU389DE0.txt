Title: Too bright, not sturdy
Content:
We loved the infrared heat but it is too bright on high especially in dim room while watching TV. Construction is poor. It is not a sturdy appliance. First I had the ball bearings fall out so it would not rotate smoothly. I managed to reassemble and it seem ok since. I live in RV and it seems vibration from travel broke the wiring to the infrared heat tube lamp and there is no easy way to fix it. The wire seems factory installed and not easily  field repairable. The lamp is not in a socket it is hard wired in. Oh this is my 2nd unit as first unit did not work properly out of box and had to return for replacement. Another gripe the tilt is limited in angle it can tilt up, not great if you want to aim it higher to hit your body. BTW as a comparison I had the chance to use a a Costco Presto parabolic. It is sturdier and does not blind you. However it does not tilt nor auto swivel. Also can make a slight signing  noise at times. I do recommend infrared heat and parabolics are great for concentrating the heat. Also ones that have variable or dual heats desirable.

Title: Screen Cracked after 6 months
Content:
I thought I loved this computer that I bought February 8, 2009 but by August 2009 the screen is cracked and I have no idea why. I am so dissapointed. I sent it to Toshiba for repair but they have been slow to get back to me on the cost. I am sure they are not going to cover a cracked screen under warrenty despite my claims that this computer was never mis-handled or dropped. I am very upset that I spend $1000 on a compter and in 6 months it is useless. It worked very well when it worked and I loved it until the cracked screen.

Title: Upgrade from Shuffle
Content:
This was an upgrade for my 7-year-old.  With the new version coming out with the camera, the price dropped sufficiently enough to warrant the purchase.  He loves it.  Easy to control and navigate for a young person.  Can listen by song list, artist, genre.  Great sound plus now he has video, album art, and pictures on his iPod.  He takes it everywhere. Oh, and it had to be blue!  Best Buy dropped their prices first, but didn't have blue.  Amazon responded quickly and dropped their prices so we go exactly what we wanted at almost the same price as Best Buy.

Title: Best thermal carafe maker out there
Content:
My wife and I love coffee and make it daily.  We have tried several coffee makers and this is by far and away the best we have had.  Makes 12 cups and keeps the coffee hot.  You have to be careful to fully close the filter basket before you make coffee and the carafe has to be lined up propertly but unless you make coffee with one hand tied behind your back, this is not a problem.  The beauty of this thing is that you never have to screw the top off of the carafe or make sure you take it out of the maker. The patented tilt and pour thing works and is pure genius. The other thing we like is the water is easy to fill and you can see the water level easily.  You will need a separate pitcher to fill as if you think of using the carafe, it would be very fussy and the carafe, with the lid off, doesnt pour very well.  Bottom line, great coffee maker.

Title: Great heater
Content:
I realy like this heater.  It is quiet, safe, cheap to run, and has no bad odor.  I heat my house with a wood burner, but at the end of the hallway where the bedrooms are can be cold in winter.  This heater in the hallway warmed that side of the house just fine. Highly recomended, bought one for my parents, and they love it.

Title: good within parameters

This heater is not bad.  My in-laws bought two of them and were happy with them.  I have found that the heater works well in a space that is generally closed and decently insulated.  Because it doesn't blow out hot air, rather it blows warm air, it cant really overcome poorly insulated spaces.  However, if you need supplemental heat in an insulated space it does OK.  As I write this its about 12 degrees outside with eight inches of snow and the dogs keep using the doggie door.  The furnace is still coming on from time to time but, it's not running continuously.  The Iheater has been on all day.  I set the heat on the Iheater a couple of degrees higher than the furnace when it's this cold out because I want it to stay warm.  When I go to bed I will turn it down a bit.  If you want or need a heater to really kick out some heat this is not for you.  If you need to heat a small, insulated space, or to supplement your existing furnace or heat pump, this is a pretty good heater.  I am not unhappy with it.  I read a review where someone was complaining about the smell.  When you start it the first time it smells for a minute or so and that's it.  No problem.  Natural gas is expensive here so, I can't imagine that this heater wont help with energy cost.  The temp in the morning is supposed to be 9 with a wind chill of 1.  This heater will stay on till the temps go back up.  I don't expect it to compete with that.  It does help keep things comfortable.  It's worth the money, especially over time.

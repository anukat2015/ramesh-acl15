Title: Disappointed after all the great reviews
Content:
I bought this product after reading all the glowing reviews on amazon. Yes, it was easy to assemble, and the suction on my area rugs was very powerful and sucked up a lot of dust. However, when I tested it on hard floor, I noticed there was no suction at all coming from the nozzle. I don't know if this was due to the technology or a defective product. I called a Hoover service center to describe the problem, and even they admitted this particular model "isn't good on hard floors." As others have said in their reviews, this vacuum is good if most of your flooring is carpet/rugs, but less so for hard surfaces. Additionally, as others have pointed out here, the bagless design sounds great in theory, but in reality it's very annoying to constantly empty out the dirt cup. I didn't think that would bother me, but emptying the dirt cup after each use is one more chore on top of vacuuming, and who wants that? Finally, the wand doesn't stay upright in a firmly locked position, as it appears in the picture. I spent about 20 min trying to figure out why it kept falling over and didn't lock in place, before I read in other amazon reviews that it's due to the design itself. Sorry Hoover, I've had this vacuum less than 24 hours but I'm returning it tomorrow and buying one with a vacuum bag next time.

Title: It's HOT
Content:
This is one of the best decisions I have made, maybe second to upgrading to android OS for my phone. The heater is easy to install, but be aware it requires 3 separate 50 AMP breakers. I already had a 100 AMP sub-panel and was able to rearrange some of the smaller breakers to the sub-panel to accommodate the bigger breakers required for this heater. Other than that, I have no issues @ all with this heater. it does what it says and more and you can not go wrong with this decision. I looked into getting other heaters, the Bosch and Titan are two that come to mind, but after doing A LOT of research I opted for Stiebel Eltron and I have not looked back. My wife was hesitant about the tankless option and decided to challenge it the first day it was installed by taking a very, very long shower.  To her surprise the water remained @ the same temperature, all while she was washing dishes and doing a load. I live in Texas and climate is not as brutal as in the northern states but I read this heater performs well in all climates.  Again YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS, IT'S HOT!!!

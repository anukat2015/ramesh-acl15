Title: didn't work well for me
Content:
We've been using one cup coffee makers for quite awhile now and find them very convenient.Generally like to use our own coffee cups rather that the travel mug supplied. This coffee maker is quite a bit larger than earlier models and didn't fit quite as easily on my counter.  You may want to check the dimensions for yourself.
It is fast to brew a single cup and simple to operate.  I do note the Black and Decker's quality is not what it once was. Our coffee maker stopped working after just a few weeks and we replaced it with another model. Customer service at Black and Decker were not particularly helpful.

Title: Cuisinart 12-Cup (7 Mug) Carafe Coffee Maker
Content:
This coffee maker is everything we expected (or hoped) it would be.  It is rated as a 12 cup-er which means it delivers about seven normal mugs of coffee.  The carafe keeps the coffee hot--in fact, much hotter than our previous coffee maker which had a heating element under the pot.  Amazingly, the carafe will keep the coffee drinkable hot for up to two hours after it has been made.
Removal of, as well as the filling of, the basket is extremely easy, too.
The only drawback (if it can be considered a drawback) is that the complete unit is extremely tall.  We had difficulty fitting it underneath the kitchen cabinet to keep it out-of-the-way.
We were unable to locate this item in any of our local stores--Macy's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Best Buy, etc etc--so we had to buy it sight-unseen from Amazon (see above concerning height) and were pleasantly surprised.

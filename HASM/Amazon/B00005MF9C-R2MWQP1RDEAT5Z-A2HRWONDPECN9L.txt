Title: Burnt coffee yuck
Content:
I gave this 2 stars only because it DID brew the coffee and it didn't go everywhere. 
Cons:
1) Coffee tastes burnt. Burnt does not equal strong. I used coffee beans from the same bag I used in my other brewing methods (a steam espresso machine, a large 12 cup coffee pot, and press pot) - so the burnt flavor isn't a problem with the beans (a simple columbian roast.) 
2) The travel mug is sturdy but lid was nearly impossible to get off. I understand why it needs to be tight - so it doesn't spill.
3) Brewing the coffee wasn't really any faster than my 12 cup coffee pot and it wasn't as fast as a one cup coffeemaker I used at a hotel once (I can not figure out what brand that was or else I wouldn't have tried this.)
4) Drip drip drip... it doesn't finish cleanly. It just keeps dripping for awhile after you think it's done. And I lifted up the lid a bit to see the water dispenser portion still dripping so it wasn't water left in the grounds in the filter.
Pros:
1) The start button wasn't "on/off" - press it down and it pops back up but it triggers the start and then turns off after it's done. 
2) It did brew the coffee.
3) It would probably work with a mug that isn't the travel mug it came with (though make sure you use the mug to measure your water.)
4) It's a LOT cheaper than the Senseo which brews about the same quality of coffee.
5) It doesn't use pods that are more expensive - use whatever coffee YOU like. 
If you like Starbucks style coffee this might be for you - "dark" because it brews too hot.
I'm sending it back.

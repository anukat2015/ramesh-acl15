Title: Who could live without this!
Content:
This machine is the greatest thing invented. I ordered this machine for my office, and everyone uses it. Its easy to use, it makes great coffee. I would highly recommend purchasing the other coffee filter piece, so that you can also brew your own coffee. Sometimes the K-cups get a little pricey. Overall this is a great product, amazing quality, and very easy to use. Clean up is a breeze.

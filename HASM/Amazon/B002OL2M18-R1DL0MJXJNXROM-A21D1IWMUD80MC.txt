Title: Poor Quality Control - Horrible Toshiba Support
Content:
Nice heavy laptop arrived 1 month after ordering, due probably to demand.  Immediately spent over 1 hour with horrible Toshiba support in barely understood
English. We came to the conclusion that either the 500GB ATA drive was not either
not present or installed improperly.  What sort of quality controls are in place 
prior to shipping that would catch this issue - I found it in 10 minutes.
Replacement was not given as an option - only refund.  Now I have to
waste an hour going back to UPS to return this item.

Title: Wonderful coffeemaker!
Content:
I was somewhat skeptical about purchasing the SmartBrew Plus because of the reasonable price . . . but I soon discovered that I couldn't have selected a better coffeemaker. It is easy to set up, simple to use - the timer is great.  I really like the way they designed it, so that you just lift the top to put in the coffee and water.  You don't have to worry about getting the filter basket back in place properly. The unit does not leak water, as some coffeemakers do; neither does the carafe.  The wide pour spout on the carafe is definitely a plus. The unit is attractive, and does not take up very much counter space. Use good-quality, fresh coffee, and it will make a great cup. I have now had the SmartBrew Plus for a little over two years, and I have no complaints.  Can't beat it for the price!

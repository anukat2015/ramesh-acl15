Title: Very versatile!
Content:
This vacuum is so versatile and simple to change from one attachment to another. I really like the three suction power levels, so you can choose the suction strength. I have had different brands of vacuums, and tried the expensive ones as well, but they didn't hold up to this one! I did a lot of research online as well as in the stores, and this vacuum is well worth the money! I purchased this from Amazon with super saver shipping, and I am just so amazed with it. If you are looking for a cannister vacuum that has power, durability, and is easily interchangeable, this is well worth the money! One of the best purchases I have made!

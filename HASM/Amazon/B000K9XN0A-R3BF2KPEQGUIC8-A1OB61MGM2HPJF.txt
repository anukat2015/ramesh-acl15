Title: I'd cheerfully pay full retail for another one
Content:
Well, maybe not cheerfully, but I'd know I was getting my money's worth. The only criticism I have is that the clock display should be a bit more readable for old f*rts like me, and the auto-on confirmation should be an LED rather than the teeny-tiny "AUTO" on the clock display.
That said, the thermal carafe is outstanding. I'd been surprised that leftover coffee seemed still warm when dumping it out late in the evening after a morning brew; the other night I had my barbecue thermometer in my shirt pocket, so I checked the temperature -- 120 degrees, fourteen hours after brewing.

Title: Great Coffee Maker for one
Content:
I absolutely love this coffee maker. I have one for the home and one for the office. It saves me time in the morning by having the coffee already in the cup and allows me to enjoy my gourmet coffee at work without the extra cost. I have heard complaints that the coffee is too weak. I use 1 1/2 T -2 T and it works just fine. I will admitt it does dripple a little after the coffee is finished, a little price to pay for the convience it gives me. One other con is that the cup is not standard and I am yet to find another travel mug that fits under the unit. A large mug will work for home.

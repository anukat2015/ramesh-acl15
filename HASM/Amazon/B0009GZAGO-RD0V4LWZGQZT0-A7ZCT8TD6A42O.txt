Title: Great camera
Content:
I just got back from Beijing and it was my first trip with this camera, what a great camera!!!
I had some pictures blown up and no grainyness at all...beautiful, crisp prints! I only have a 256mb card so I got 250+ medium grade pictures, so I shot my last day (the Terra Cotta Army) with my Minolta film SLR. Still great pictures, it has never failed me.
The reason I didn't give the Nikon 4 stars is because it is so heavy to carry! I know it's one of the lightest SLRs Nikon makes but compared to my Minolta, it weighs a ton!
If you're looking for a good SLR, this is a great choice! It will do everything you need. We left the Great Wall in the evening and saw a rare sight, the Wall was lit up. We got to stop and take pictures, this camera did a good job with automatic ACTION setting and ISO 400. 
I was afraid that this camera would disappoint me on this once in a lifetime trip but to the contrary. I might leave my Minolta home next time:)

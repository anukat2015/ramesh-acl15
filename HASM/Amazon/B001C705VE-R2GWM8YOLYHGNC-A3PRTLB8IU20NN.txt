Title: Horrible machine and parts
Content:
I had a Melitta MEMB1B for a few years and loved the coffee and machine.  When it finally started leaking too much, I replaced it with the "smart" mill and brew.  Smart machine maybe, but I was a stupid idiot for buying it (and paying WAAAAY more than my original wonderful Melitta.  After only 3 or 4 weeks, the plastic posts on the carafe lid broke off.  After about 1 1/2 months the weather and everything else stopped working, giving me error messages that something was not functioning and no info could be obtained.  After 3 months, I turned it on, and....nothing.  It won't brew.  
AVOID this machine like the plague.  I wrote to Melitta and no answer.  I threw it in the trash.

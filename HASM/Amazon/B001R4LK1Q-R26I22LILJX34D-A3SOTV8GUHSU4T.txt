Title: Bring Back the Original Brew Station!
Content:
I loved my original brew station by HB, but this one has serious design flaws!  The carraffe that you pour the water into spills all over if you pour it on the big metal heater in the middle, and the stream of coffee is set too far back.  when i pour my coffee if i'm not holding the whole contraption with both hands the coffee doesn't even come close to going in the mug!  I miss my old brew station and i'm thinking of just ordering it online as Target doesn't carry them any more. Don't waste your time with this one.  get the older model.

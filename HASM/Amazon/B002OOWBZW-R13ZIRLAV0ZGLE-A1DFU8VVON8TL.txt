Title: just OK

I really thought the touch pad wouldn't bother me, because I've had lots of laptops, and touch pads have always been idiosyncratic, but learnable. However this bar is extremely hard to push down compared to my old Dell XPS or HP laptops--it fatigues/stresses my left thumb quite a bit. It makes the difference between comfortable and uncomfortable. You almost need to develop a two-handed technique to navigate and select, or use a mouse. The whole point of this device is to keep it simple, and requiring a mouse is not simplifying.
It does show lots of fingerprints and dust, but I don't mind that so much.
Toshiba recently sent out an update for the speaker problem. They work fine now. But until they fixed that, it was very annoying to hear the muffled sound.
I typically like Toshiba's design and support, but they shouldn't have sent out a laptop with this crappy selection bar.

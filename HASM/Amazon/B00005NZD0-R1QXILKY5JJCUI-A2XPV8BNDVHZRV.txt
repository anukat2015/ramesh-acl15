Title: Short lifespan
Content:
I purchased this product as a gift for a friend.  I am sorry to report that the espresso maker has effectively ceased working after less than two years, and it was not used every day.  While the coffee maker side continues to work adequately, I could have spent far less if all I wanted to get was a decent regular coffee maker.  For this price I expect a longer service life.

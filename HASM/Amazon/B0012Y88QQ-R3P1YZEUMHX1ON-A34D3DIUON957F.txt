Title: Great step-up from S3-IS..
Content:
The XSi is a great step-up from the high-end point & shoot. The learning curve was fairly short when moving from the "S3 IS" to the XSi. Some functions are actually easier to use on the XSi than on the S3. 
The camera size & weight is still reasonable, I carry the XSi with an attached Sigma 18-200mm zoom lens, in an M-Rock Glacier bag attached to the handlebars of my bicycle. Some of my photos may be found on Flickr, where I go by the name "Versageek"    
A Fair warning to those moving from "point & shoot" to DSLR (applies to most DSLR's not just this one):  While the 18-55mm lens is great for macro shots, if you are used to 10-12x zoom on a point & shoot, you'll need to purchase an additional lens costing between $500-$1000+.  You'll also want an extra battery pack (~$50), a 58mm UV haze filter to protect your lens ($~40+), a sturdy camera bag (~$80+) & a good tripod (~$120+).

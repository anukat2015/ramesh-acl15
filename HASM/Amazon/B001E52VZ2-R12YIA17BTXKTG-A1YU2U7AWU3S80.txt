Title: Great vacuum at a great price
Content:
I researched all the popular canister vacuums before settling on the Eureka/Electrolux 3670G. It does an excellent job of cleaning hardwood floors and other smooth surfaces, and is ideal for cleaning the car. The standard floor attachment is not the best, but Eureka sells a number of floor, wall, and crevice attachments on their site at a very reasonable price. Other than that, I am extremely pleased at how the vacuum performs. It has great suction and the noise level is not too bad. with the right attachment it even does a fair job on carpet, but it does not perform as well as an upright in this regard.

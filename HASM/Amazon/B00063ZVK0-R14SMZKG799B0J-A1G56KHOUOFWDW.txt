Title: I can use this one......
Content:
I keep birds, and in the winter months and cooler days I want their cage areas warmer than the rest of the house (we keep the thermostat on 62 degrees in winter because the upstairs stays too warm otherwise, but the little heaters keep the birds and us from freezing downstairs.)
In attempt to keep the birds warm in our cool house, I have gone through several little heaters and settled on this Vornado model as the best for my purposes, although I also continue to use two Honeywell models I bought a while ago.  
My Vornado heater circulates the air with or without the heating element running and makes the ambient heat even. 
I have a wall heater/air conditioning unit at work, so I brought a Vornado into the office to keep my feet warm and my head cool. I've even used it on hot days to circulate the cold air from the floor (with the heating element off). I have a Vornado fan upstairs at home for the same purpose in summer.  I figure the technology is similar?
I like the dial on the Vornado better than that on the other little heaters because I can't understand their dials--even after reading the instructions over and over (I don't reset the temps very often, so once I figure it out if I don't use it for a while, I forget how to use it).  The Vornado is very straightforward for a 'non-mechanical' person like me--what you see is what you get. I also use the Vordado air filter systems for my birds and me. I love Vornado products.

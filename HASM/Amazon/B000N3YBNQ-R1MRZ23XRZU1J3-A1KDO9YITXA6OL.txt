Title: Great fold up Vacuum
Content:
We love,love, love this vacuum.  The primary reason we consider purchasing it is because of how compact it is.  Because of limited space in our RV, it is the perfect vacuum. I was concerned that it might not perform as well as our home vacuum, but I was completely blown away by how great it did on our carpets and hardwood floors.   The only thing that I wish it had are hand tools for furniture.  Great product.

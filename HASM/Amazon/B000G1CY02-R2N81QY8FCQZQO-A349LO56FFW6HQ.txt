Title: Like a portable fireplace
Content:
I've had the DeLonghi HHP1500 for about a month & so far it has been great.  It's in my office-- nice and quiet, which is what I was hoping for.  A few pops and pings as it cycles on and off, but nothing like the noise that a fan operated device generates.  I have it sitting about twelve inches away on the low setting and it feels like I'm sitting about 6 feet from a slow burning fire.  Perfect.
According to a watt meter, the heater uses about 700 Watts on the low setting and 1400 watts on high.  The back of the heater does get hot -- nearly as hot as the front (on low you can touch either side about 1-2 seconds before it's too hot to handle, on high it's more like 1/4 second)-- I'd have to think twice about mounting it directly on the wall.  On the other hand, it's not so bad that I'm concerned about having the back of the heater a few inches away from a bookcase.
The only feature that I'd say it lacks would be a timer-- I suppose I could use a wall timer, but it's so much easier (& safer, I believe) if it's built in to begin with.
I'm hoping it holds up through a few winters-- if so it definitely earns a 5 star rating.

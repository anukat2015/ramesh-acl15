Title: A Triple but not a Home Run
Content:
I have owned this camera for almost a month now.  There have been some disappointments but overall I have been pleased.  I also own two Olympus DSLRs so I bought the adapter that allows me to use those regular 4/3 lenses.  My main interest in the camera was the compact size and the styling.  My other Olympus cameras going back to a 1970's OM-2n have been extremely reliable so I had no hesitation in that regard. My impressions (pro and con) so far are: Pros: 1) excellent image quality even with the kit lense. 2) nice to have both standard and hi def video capability, 3) better noise reduction at high ISO settings than other Olympus cameras, 4) excellent build quality, 5) The "cool factor" is very high.  Cons: 1) I wish it had a built in flash for fill in use although I have used my Olympus FL-36 flash on it with no problems, 2) I wish it has some sort of viewfinder and hope a third party electronic viewfinder will become available soon, 3) it is pricey and will likely be a niche product, 4) The kit lenses are not "fast" which does present some low light/action issues, 5) accessories are expensive.  Overall, while there are some significant drawbacks I don't regret the purchase. For someone who doesn't want to lug a camera bag everywhere this is a great "walk around" camera with image quality that far surpasses point and shoot models.  If they can get the price down and make more lenses available it could be a winner for Olympus.

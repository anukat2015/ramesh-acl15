Title: An  Entry lebel Pro DSLR
Content:
This is an excellent camera for serious amateur or entry level professional. However, the camera has few setting for novice DSLR users e.g. flower mode which I find pretty useless. Maybe Nikon is targeting few customers from it's coolpix range camera users but I give a star less for those extra setting.
The ISO range is very good, but the metering is not always at it's best. I have shot few hundreds photos with 3F auto exposure bracketing but sometime I got all 3 shots underexposed. The metering system could have been better. Only electronic cable release is available. It should have been made a part of standard accessory.
The bottom line is that the camera dose produce excellent photographs.

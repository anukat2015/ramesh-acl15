Title: Krups - not as good as it used to be
Content:
I had a KRUPS for years and loved it.  So when I changed colors in my kitchen, I decided to buy another KRUPS.  At first it looked cool but the white gets stained easy and the quality isn't as good.  The glass carafe used to have a metal band around it with a removeable lid.  Now the handle is glued on and the lid is attached which makes it hard to put in the dishwasher.  The coffeemaker is all right, but if I had to do it over again I would pick something else.

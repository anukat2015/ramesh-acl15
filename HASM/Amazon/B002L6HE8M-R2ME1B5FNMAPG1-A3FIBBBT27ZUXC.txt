Title: Nano is a no-no.
Content:
Sometimes it doesn't pay to shrink things so much... The Nano is almost too small. It doesn't sound great out of the box, meaing you have to apply some EQ. I am not a fan of iTunes. Windows Media Player does a better job of sync'ing files with portable mp3 players. You can't just delete songs or video from your iPod to free up space, you have to use iTunes which is a pain. The program wants to categorize all your music for you (and decide which songs should be sync'ed when space gets limited). Windows Media also does a better job of finding album artwork. Of course if you bought all your music from the iTunes store than it would get it right. I wonder if Apple does that on purpose??  Apple put the video camera at the wrong end of the device (it is counter intuitive). You have to hold it upside down when in portrait mode or flip it on the side and make sure you don't block the lens with your hand when you hit the middle of the jog wheel to start/stop recording. To export your video clips you have to access the device via MY COMPUTER. Check out the Creative Zen players... they got it right.

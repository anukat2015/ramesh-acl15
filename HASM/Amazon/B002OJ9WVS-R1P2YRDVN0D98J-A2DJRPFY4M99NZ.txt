Title: Expect cord problems sooner or later
Content:
Miele vacuums are good vacuums as long as they work and supposedly to be designed to last approximately 20 years.  They may last 20 years but if so they'll do it sitting in a closet and not in use.  I've owned two different middle level Miele vacuums and the internal connection that permits the cord to transmit electricity gave out in about 3 years on one machine while the second machine lasted about five years before it to gave up the ghost.  Both vacuums cost over $600 at the time of purchase and within a few years you are face with a cord replacement which is not an inexpensive exercise.  Again Miele's are good vacuums while they work but expect cord problems due to an unresolved design flaw.

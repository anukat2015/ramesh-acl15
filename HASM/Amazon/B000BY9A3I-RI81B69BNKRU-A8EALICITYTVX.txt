Title: Good for hard surfaces-skip it if you have rugs
Content:
This machine is relatively small, quite powerful, and very quiet for a vacuum.  Another reviewer indicated that the tools tend to fall off the storage bracket on the handle attachment, and I find that to be the case.  I just leave them off the handle to avoid the problem.
The variable power switch is a nice feature.
Typical of canisters, it does a marvelous job on hard floors, less so on rugs and carpet.  The carpet head is a real problem-it's not powered.  It relies on suction for a 'turbo' drive to run the brushes. As far as I'm concerned it's a flawed design and is essentially worthless as it ceases to spin with any kind of resistance. That presents a problem as one of the things I wanted to use it on was carpeted stairs.  For rugs/carpets on level surfaces stick with an upright.
Be prepared to empty the dirt canister and pick the fuzz off the filter frequently. 
All in all, if I had it to do over again I would not buy this unit.  I'd look for one with a powered head.

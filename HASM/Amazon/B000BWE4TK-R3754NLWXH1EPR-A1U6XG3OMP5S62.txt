Title: Love It
Content:
I love this camera. I happened to have an old Nikon N2020 SLR with a half dozen, almost new in the box, Nikkor AF lenses, (circa 1986).Every one of them work great with my D50 body. I know it's not a camera a pro would want, but you can do a sight more with it than point and shoot. The manual is a tome but after you try and read it buy Nikon D50 Digital Field Guide (Paperback) by David D. Busch, which helped me a lot as I haven't used an SLR in a long time and need to be retrained. Unless you need to print posters the 6.1MP D50 works for me.

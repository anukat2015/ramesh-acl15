Title: seller good cooler bad.
Content:
the swamp cooler did not even get near my expectations. i bought it thinking it might be more than a fan but i poured the right amount of ice and water in and all it was was a huge fancy fan that filters your air. but the thing is that when i returned it i shipped it friday from WA and it arrived in CA around tuesday and they returned my money right away for that i am very glad. thanks for being fair sellers. i will likely buy a real air conditioner from your sight soon.

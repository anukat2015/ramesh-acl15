Title: SO much more than an MP3 player!
Content:
This is the best mp3 player on the market!  Browsing music is a snap, movies on the go are a lifesaver with my kids, the apps! oh the apps!  where do I start?  My son's favorite is flick fishing, mine are cake  mania 3 and the amazon kindle ( I actually prefer it to my kindle!), my daughter's is Trace, my husband's is i-copter.  The weather channel and checkers (both free!) are also neat, not to mention the internet availability.  My whole family is seriously addicted! You will not regret the purchase.

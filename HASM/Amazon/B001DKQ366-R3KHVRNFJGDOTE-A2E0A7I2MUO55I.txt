Title: it's like a dribble glass from a novelty store
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker because it was inexpensive, basic and has the auto shutoff feature.  It does everything I expected, but... it dribbles water or coffee on my counter top every time I fill the reservoir or pour coffee.  Very annoying! After fighting and cussing it for a couple of weeks, I couldn't take it anymore and removed the electrical components from this coffee maker and made my old coffee maker in to an auto shut off model.  Perfect! Now I am happy.  LOL

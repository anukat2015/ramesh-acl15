Title: Very Disappointed
Content:
Like so many others I read the reviews on just about every parabolic heater Amazon sold. All of them seemed to have problems of one kind or another but of the many this seemed the best. What I'm most disappointed about is the amount of heat put out by this unit. I had it on the 800w setting last night at a distance of about 4 ft. from me and was certainly not overly warm. I've experienced other parabolic heaters and they sure seemed to put out a lot more heat than this Optimus. Their customer service was not a great help in giving me an idea of how much heat I should expect. The bottom line for me is that it just doesn't put out that much heat. I really out to return it

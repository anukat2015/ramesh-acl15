Content:
I wanted to use this heater for several weeks before writing a review.  We use it in our large living room which is about 600 sq. ft. with 10'  a cathedral ceiling.  It is early Jan. and we live in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mtns with lows about 35-40.
The heater does a very nice job and keeps the room at about 64 degrees while the other rooms in the house are unheated at are around 55 degrees.  In a small dining area, where we eat our meals, it gets warm very fast.  Also it heats our bathroom quickly.
The heater takes a little getting used to and the controls are easy to operate after a little while.  A switch for on and off, one for lowering and raising the temp., one for mode (auto, low, high), and the other for rotation on and off.
The remote is handy to use and the only change I would suggest would be a place to put the remote on the heater.
I am well satisified with performance and it has been the best electric heater I have owned.

Title: Love my iPod
Content:
I've only had my iPod for a few days, but so far it's great.  The sound is wonderful and the interface is easy to use.  The touch wheel is a bit sensitive... I nearly rendered myself hearing impaired after accidentally turning the volume way up. I primarily use it at the gym and it's nice and light.  When I'm running, I can use the clip it comes with to clip it to the machine, otherwise, I can clip it onto my shorts and it doesn't bother me at all.  
I had some problems installing, however.  I'm using windows XP and the cd that came with the ipod didn't have the most current software for formatting the ipod, whereas I had the newest version of iTunes already on my computer.  After downloading the newest software updates, everything worked just fine.

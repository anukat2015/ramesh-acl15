Title: Perfect For Allergies
Content:
This is a really great value in a high quality canister vacuum.  It captures all the dust in a triple layer bag which has a sliding tab to close the opening as you remove the bag so that you are never exposed to the dust.  And there is never any dust inside the machine -- it ALL stays inside the well insulated bag.  Changing bags is a snap, it slips right into a holder.  Everything about this Bosch BSG81313UC is very well engineered.  It is the quietest vacuum I ever used, and it has variable suction so that you can clean drapes or fabrics without sucking them into the nozzle.  The wheels glide smoothly over all surfaces, and there are good rubber bumpers all around so that you do not nick or scratch your furniture.  The handle and light weight make it easy to carry.  This excellent German product sells for a fraction of the other major German vacuum cleaner: Miele.  I cannot imagine how those more expensive ones could possibly be any better.  You WILL love this one and have HUNDREDS of dollars left over to celebrate your good choice!

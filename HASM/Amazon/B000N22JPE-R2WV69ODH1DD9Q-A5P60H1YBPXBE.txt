Title: Great coffemaker!
Content:
We have been using this for about a week and so far are extremely happy with this coffeemaker.  I had a Black & Decker that quit working after about 3 months and a Mr. Coffee that took at LEAST 20 minutes to make a pot of coffee!
This coffeemaker makes a pot quick and makes it hot.  I LOVE the carafe, you can pour a cup anywhere and not spill any coffee!  The clocks is fairly easy to set and since we don't use the programming on it dont' know about that yet but it looks like it's easy to set up.  I saw some reviews complain about the access to pour water into the coffeemaker and I personally don't believe it is too small.  I also like that the coffeemaker beeps when it is finished making the coffee since I am usually in another room while it is brewing.
I would buy this coffeemaker again in an instant!

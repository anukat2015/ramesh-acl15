Title: good looking buy clumsy
Content:
I pondered a new vacuum for a long time. I settled on this one for the looks and reviews. It is beautifully built, metal tubes, solid plastic body, long cord, good looking! My house is mostly hardwood and the cleaning head is better suited to carpet. When I remove the head, the suction is strong, but when the head is attached with out the beater bar on (bare floor mode), I think my old up right was better. I have a small house with lots of corners and I'm always unsticking the main unit from not rounding a corner, too much bending for me.guess I'll keep it and learn to manage.

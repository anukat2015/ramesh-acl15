Title: smelly
Content:
This is a nice product and like the thermostat control, for the price good.  Our problem with the unit is that after a few times of using it, it then sat for a short period before use again.  When we started the unit back up we noticed a very offensive smell that won't go away.  I would be curious if anyone else has that problem.  I didn't notice one other review with that comment.

Title: Amazing Photos.
Content:
An avid photographer, I was upgrading from a Sony Cybershot that I had had for 5 years and that had essentially been another appendage. So I read review after review... knowing simply that I wanted my next camera to be user friendly, have more pixels/take clearer photos than my previous, have greater zoom, a larger LCD screen and give me editing options for photos taken. Well, my Nikon D80 delivers all of this and more. I've had it for 1 month today and I've taken over 200 photos... and to give you another's perspective, friends have commented on the clarity of all the photos that I have shared with them. I'm a thrilled with it. It was worth EVERY PENNY!

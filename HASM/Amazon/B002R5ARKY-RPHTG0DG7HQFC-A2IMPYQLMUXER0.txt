Title: HP PRODUCTS BEWARE -- A MUST READ
Content:
Yeah I am sure all the new HP laptops look and work GREAT, so did mine 2 years ago BUT is less than 2 years on the market a good sign? If you are considering an HP you better read these links first - don't get stuck in our position 2 years from now! Also just Google HP laptops lately - NOT GOOD.

I was a faithful HP customer until now. We bought a dv6000 in July 2007 from Circuit City and thank God we bought the protection plan plus also. This laptop has been in for repair 3 times since last summer and all the same problems described in the Kioskea posts. Having the plan is great BUT the repair people and the warranty people don't communicate with each other, probably because the techs are American and the warranty people farm their telecommunications to scripted robots in India??? HP should have stepped up to the plate and RECALLED this batch of laptops rather than wait until people get stuck with unworkable products! If this next repair does not fix the problem, Apple here I come.

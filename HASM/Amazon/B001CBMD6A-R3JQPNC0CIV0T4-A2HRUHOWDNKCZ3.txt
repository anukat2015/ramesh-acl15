Title: Excellent One
Content:
I am new to DSLR world and this is my first SLR camera. It is amazingly good :). I bought it because I was planning for a cruise to Alaska and the buy was worth it. Took around 1000 photos and they all turned well. The 'basic-options' are really simple to use and with some minimum 'users manual' reading you will be a pro with the advanced-options. I found the buttons very easy to use. I got the best price at Amazon and also got the prime shipping benefit :).
The battery lasted for 3-4 days during the cruise with a single charge, even after continuously using it.
You get so many lens options with Canon which is another good thing. 
I didnt find any issue with this camera and I would recommend it to all beginners.

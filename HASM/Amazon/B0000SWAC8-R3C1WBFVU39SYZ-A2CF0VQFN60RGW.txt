Title: Electrolux EL 6988D Oxygen Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner about a month ago, and I absolutely love it. We use it every day, and it just keeps working like the little trooper it is. The handle is well placed for carrying it when vacuuming stairs, and even tho it is small and lightweight, it has plenty of power. The light canister is easy to maneuver, and the machine has excellent suction. If there is anything I would change, it would be the way the dusting attachment snaps into the handle. It isn't always the most secure and falls out occasionally. I would definitely recommend this vacuum to a prospective buyer.

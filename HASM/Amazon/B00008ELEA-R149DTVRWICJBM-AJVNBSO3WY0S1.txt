Title: Great tasting coffee
Content:
Love my new percolator.  The coffee taste so much better than regular drip and it is much hotter which I also like.  I wish the coffee pot had a light to let you know it is still on or plugged in.  I do feel like I use much more coffee now which is another downside.  Also, the markings for how many cups of water are on the outside but you aren't able to see through to tell how much water you have??  weird.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Lisa

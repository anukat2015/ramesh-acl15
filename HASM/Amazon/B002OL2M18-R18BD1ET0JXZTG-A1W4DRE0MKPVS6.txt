Title: Excellent Gaming Laptop
Content:
I have had this Qosmio X505-Q880 with the 1080p screen for a week now. Everything on this machine is great except for a few of the con's mentioned in other reviews ... small touchpad, sound makes popping noises here and there, the mute and sound button clicks when turning off or down.  I dont remember if other have complained on this one, but the SSD (65GB) its just not large enough.  When they throw in the recovery parition you are left with about 47gb.  Now throw in Windows 7, all the Toshiba software, and Windows Updates, I am left with 15GB.  I had to install some larger applications such as MS Office 2007 and Adobe Creative Suite on the HDD. It's not such a big deal right now but as I install more software I am sure it will just keep adding into the Primary boot drive. Couple more items. One that had me worried on the first day of testing, the screen started to pixilate in the middle, a long strip.  I closed my app and reopened.  It was gone. Havent seen it since.  This machine is HUGE and I knew that when buying.  I think for the same money I might have just purchased a desktop because there is no way I'm going to be lugging this thing around. Would have saved a little money.
Great machine all around however.  Windows Experience Rating: 6.6. Not loud and doesnt get hot like you would image a laptop of this size to get.  Hopefully it will stay this way even when the machine gets older.

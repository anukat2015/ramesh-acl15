Title: A Very Nice Product
Content:
I purchased the 16GB orange version of this with the idea of using it for music and audio books. I took advantage of audible's promotion, getting $100 off, which put it in a more reasonable price range. I probably would not actually spend $180 on this, but that's a personal decision.
The memory is more then sufficient for your audio needs--unless you plan to add mass amounts of video. Sound quality is good, although like many people I will be switching the standard ear buds for something more comfortable and efficient. As for the jazzy extras, like the shake-shuffle and the cover flow, they are nice--but more importantly, they are easily shut off.
I recommend this product to anyone planning to use it for music and other audio. It has a nice design and is easy to use.

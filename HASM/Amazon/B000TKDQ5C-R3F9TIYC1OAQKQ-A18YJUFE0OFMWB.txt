Title: low quality
Content:
received heater and immediately the fan made noises.  it was loose and a constant rattle.  was using for a bedroom and impossible to sleep with the noise.  returned for what i am hoping is a bit better Lasko model.  great little heater if it was actually quite.  must have poor quality control or damaged during shipping.

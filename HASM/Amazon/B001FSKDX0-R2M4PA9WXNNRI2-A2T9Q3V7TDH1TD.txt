Title: quality, size and price
Content:
When I shop around for a new digital camera, my concerns are picture quality, size and price. First, if you have done research, you know G1 has great picture quality. I will go into detail on the G1 picture quality, you can search online reviews. In my opinion, the biggest benefit on this G1 is size. If you have a family, you want something easy to carry around like the G1. This G1 is light weight but feel solid. I have the G1 for a month now. I have been carrying the G1 around. The camera actually fits into my winter coat pocket. For some of the premium point and shoot, you have to spend this much anyway. So I just answer my price concerns.

Title: Excellent heater
Content:
I purchased this heater for several reasons. I liked the fact it can be mounted on the wall and for the various functions and price. like setting the digital temperature control, which the heater will shut off at it's desired level and it's own built in Ground Fault interrupter switch. 
I'm retired so I haven't used the the function of having the heater to come on at a desired time.
This model does put out the heat so it should be ample for an average size bathroom.
The reason I did not give it 5 stars as it does not have a turn off switch when tipped over; shame though it wasn't included; but over all I do recommend this model whole heartily
I purchased mine on the "Bay" for $20.00

Title: my switch to digital
Content:
1. Complete control over every aspect of the picture-taking process. You can pretty much override and alter any of the "default" settings with ease. One complaint: there should be a mode in which you set the aperture & shutter speed and the camera picks the optimal ISO; perhaps there is one -- I haven't found it yet.
2. The menu system scared me at first, but after about an hour of playing with it, it becomes remarkably intuitive. A little practice is all that's needed.
3. According to the gurus, 8 Mpix is enough resolution to easily beat out even the slowest film in terms of detail. It's not that digital has better resolution, it's that the "noise" is much lower. I'm used to medium format work, and I have no qualms about the switch.
4. Camera is small and light. I don't know what other people are talking about; I have big fat hands and have no problem manipulating all the controls, taking steady pictures, etc. Perhaps they are just used to larger cameras? In any case, there's no reason to be afraid of this guy because of the size.
5. Autofocus sometimes has to "hunt" a little in low-light conditions, and its possible to confuse the system. However, I can't cross-compare: this is the first system I've used with autofocus!

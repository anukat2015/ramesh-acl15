Title: Air Cooler for dry climate
Content:
Great product and works great. It only will work in dry climate. If you live in area with high humidity it isnt for you. We turn the central air off at night and sleep with this air cooler blowing on us and we actually have to cover up it gets so cool. Great product and makes the air smell good in our bedroom. The remote control is great.

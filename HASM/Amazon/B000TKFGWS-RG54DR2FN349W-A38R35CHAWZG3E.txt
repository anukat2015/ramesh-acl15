Title: Great little heater
Content:
We own a 26ft travel trailer.  We bought this heater to supplement the gas furnace on the trailer.  While camping in 40 degree temps at night this heater drastically reduced the amount of time the furnace kicked on during the night.  Most of the time the heater itself on the low setting produced plenty of heat to maintain a comfortable temperature.  The heater operates quietly.  The heater does draw several amps on the high setting, so you do have to turn it off while running the microwave or hair dryer to keep from tripping the circuit breaker.  Overall I have been pleased with the heaters performance.  It was the perfect choice for our camper.

Title: A good buy..
Content:
this is my first vacuum and because i have hard wood floors and a few mats and area rugs scattered around the house, i thought this would suit me right.
It is lightweight to carry around and has a 2oft cord so i can easily get one room done in one go. The suction is not quite what i expected but it is a great buy as it really does pick up alot and leaves the floor very clean.
I guess i am picky, i wanted to hear alot of "suction" noise to feel i was doing a good job, but with a new baby in the house, she barely notices i have it on.
I am overall please with the purchse. i gave it four stars becuase i have not been able to purchse the bags for it but i will be searching..

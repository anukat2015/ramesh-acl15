Title: Don't buy Creative Zen product
Content:
I bought Creative Zen PMC in November 2005. It stops working last month because of the battery swelling up. I have to break the battery door to get it out. I am afraid that it will explode and contact the company.
Response from Creative:
Unfortunately, your Zen PMC is no longer in warranty. This product is ending it's service life and has been replaced with newer and more feature rich products. We are no longer maintaining PMC stock or accessories stock in either retail or repair channels.
The most that I'm going to be able to offer to you is a 20% discount on the purchase of a new product.

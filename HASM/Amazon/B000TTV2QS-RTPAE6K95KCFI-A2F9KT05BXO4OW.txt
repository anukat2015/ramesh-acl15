Title: Quiet Operation
Content:
This unit which is smaller than I'm used to provides excellent heat. When turned on the operation is quiet
and heats up a medium size room quickly. It has the choice of oscillating or standing still which I really 
like. This unit turns off automatically when the room reaches the temperature you have selected. It turns
on again when the temperature drops.I like this because it can help you save on your electricity bill.
It has 2 settings to choose from one 750 watts (low) 1500 watts (high) I'm very happy with this purchase.

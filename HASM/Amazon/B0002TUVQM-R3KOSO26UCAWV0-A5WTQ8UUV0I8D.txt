Title: Spout breaks
Content:
My wife and I owned two of these machines. We loved it except the handle on the spout (whatever you call where the cocoa/coffee comes out) broke on both of them relatively quickly. (Plastic) We had no problems other than that, but we weren't going to keep forking out money for these to keep breaking. That one flaw is all that keeps us from owning another one.
We ended up going with Mr. Coffee's Cocoamotion. It has no spout to break, but everything else is the same. We're actually on our second one, having wore the other one out!

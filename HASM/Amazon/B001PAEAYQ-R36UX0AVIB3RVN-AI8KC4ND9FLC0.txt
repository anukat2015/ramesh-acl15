Title: Worth the price
Content:
I've used the MP3 player for radio, audio books, and music; downloading from CD's or online to computer on both mac and PC, but keeping to windows media.  Tried ipod material just to see if it would work, which it didn't, so I successfully erased the material using my mac.  My motorola V190 charger works to recharge the MP3 player which is a plus.  I use my own earphones as I'm not comfortable with ear buds as a general rule.  The free downloads were welcome, though I did cancel the subscription before it went to automatic billing.  Most of my songs are from CD's and my audiobooks are from public domain where I've become reacquainted with Mark Twain whose books are free online. The free music downloads allowed me to find old, old songs from the 1940's which I remember from early childhood. I put the free audiobook download on my wife's MP3 player because she likes Evanovich mysteries & they were on the list.

Title: Telescopic Wand broke within 6 months- buy something else!
Content:
This vacuum performed well for the first 6 months, when the height adjustment to the telescopic wand broke.
 So the handle extends and contracts as you vacuum. I called the manufacturer and they said this was not covered under the warranty. I have been waiting for a month now for the replacement part, and received notice today that it will be another 3-4 weeks before it comes. Ugh! Buy something else. Poor customer  service and warranty!

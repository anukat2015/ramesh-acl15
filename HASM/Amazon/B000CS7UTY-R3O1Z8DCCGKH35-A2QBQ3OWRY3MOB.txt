Title: I love the Zen
Content:
I have had my 30GB Zen for a few years now, and I still love it.  It has more features than an Ipod: FM Radio and ability to connect to a TV to view movies just by buying a cord.  An important feature to me is that you don't have to have Itunes to add music.  You can drag files to it like you do any other file on your computer without having to open up a specialized program, so you can visit friends and put their music files on your Zen very easily.  There was a period about a year ago that it was acting glitchy, but I think it was just going through its adolescence.  It's been fine for a long time now, and if this one ever gives out, I will absolutely buy another.  True, there aren't as many accessories designed especially for the Zen as for the Ipod, but there are plenty of generic mp3-compatible accessories that fit the bill: cases, portable mini speakers, stereo systems, etc.

Title: Eureka mightty Mite Vac model 3680
Content:
I wanted this primarily for hardwood floors and it is not adequate at all - my very old Eureka tank works on hardwood floors better.  Very disappointing.  We did not buy it for carpets - we have an upright one for carpets.  Why isn't there a "brush" type part for scooping up hair and loose things on hardward floors?

Title: Pleasantly surprised
Content:
I have owned other MP3 players with similar storage capacities (most notably the relatively bulky RaveMP player).  I was a little hesitant about the nano because everything Apple seems to be over-priced, however, I was very pleasantly surprised when I purchased the nano.  It has excellent sound quality (and volume capability), with surprisingly sturdy construction for such a small piece of equipment.
I run marathons, so it's important to have a reliable MP3 player.  The RaveMP was a good player, but the nano's construction, sound quality, customizable playlists, and it's ability to play MP4 music blows the Rave away.  Battery life is also around 12-14 hours (depending on volume and viewing options), and stores pictures as well as music.
I would've liked to have an arm-band that fully covers the nano against the elements (running in the Northwest can get a little soggy), but the one I did purchase covers most of it, holds the player snuggly against my upper-arm, and runs about $30.  I am hoping an arm-band similar to the full-size ipod is available soon.
I have friends with ipods, and found them to be a little heavy and bulky for running, but the nano seems to be the perfect size and it's viewing options and storage capacity makes it superior to the ipod shuffle in every way. Well worth the investment, but be careful not to leave it laying around, it'll disappear quick.

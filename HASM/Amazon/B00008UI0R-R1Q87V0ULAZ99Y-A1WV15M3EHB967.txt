Title: Great vacuum for the price!
Content:
This vacuum does exactly what is claims to do.  It comes with all the expected accessories (crevice tool, furniture brush) and then some (carpet beater bar, small beater bar tool) and since I have hardwood floors, a great hard floor tool that is much wider than normal ones.  I didn't read about that in the description but it is fantastic and really makes a difference.  It is small and easy to transport up and down stairs with the handle on top of the unit.  Great purchase!

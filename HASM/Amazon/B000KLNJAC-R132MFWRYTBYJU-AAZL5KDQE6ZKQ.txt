Title: Poor product
Content:
This product worked great at first, but over time, this particular product line of Soleus Air Micathermic heaters will lose their ability to heat over time.  Advertised at 1000 Watts, now, after 1 year, is 478 Watts, and loses wattage each day it's used.    This means it's outputting less and less heat.
I submitted a claim to Soleus Air and they have not resolved the problem - they only gave some explanation thinking they were right, but I sent them more details of the problem and they have not responded for over 1 month.  Looking up my case number on their site, they consider this case resolved.  It is not.
This is product is faulty and you won't get any reimbursements, so be careful, and buy a different brand, or a different heating technology like ceramic.
I will not ever buy a Soleus Air product again - I do not want to support their company in producing poor quality products with poor customer support.

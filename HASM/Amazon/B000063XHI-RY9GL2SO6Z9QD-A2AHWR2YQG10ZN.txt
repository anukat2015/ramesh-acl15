Title: The best thermal carafe coffee maker
Content:
I have had one of these at work since 2004, just purchased another one for home - it has been rated in the top 5 at consumer reports for the past 4-5 years I believe, to me the built in filter holder and stainless steel water ways is what makes it superb - and of course it makes excellent coffee, especially if you use Caribou-Coffee grounds! If you are amongst us that understand why you NEVER fill water using the carafe, then this is the right coffee maker for you.
The only reason it does not get 5 out of 5 is that it is so expensive.

Title: I LOVE THIS VACUUM!
Content:
OK, so I thought I'd never get rid of my Dyson...after all, it has worked wonderfully and I've never had a problem with it.  But I recently had an opportunity to try my sister's Electrolux Oxygen 3...and I love it!  It comes with every attachment you'll ever need, and the canister design is great because you don't have to push around the weight of the vacuum's motor while working.  And the retractable cord makes for a wonderful end to vacuuming...simply press a button and the cord gets sucked right on up into the canister!  I love AND highly recommend this vacuum!!

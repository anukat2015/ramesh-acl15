Title: Creative Zen Vision:M 30GB:  Shipped Quick, Ripped and Jammin'
Content:
The Creative Zen Vision M is SNAP... Total entertainment in the first MP3 I've ever owned.  Did tons of research, read the reviews, and this was my CHOICE and I'm a happy consumer.
Graphics are great! Sound qualilty is EXCELLENT.  Amazon shipped this much faster than I expected, that was a bonus! 
Bought a leather case and screen guard, a must to protect the screen from scratches.
Recorded a song off an FM preset station (sounds awesome).  Tons of options on this MP3.  Rips songs faster than I imagined.  Ripped songs from my CDs easily and directly to the ZEN (via USB port on PC and software provided with the Vision M) instead of uploading to the computer.  This saved me time and hard drive space on my PC.  Touch pad has tons of options/settings you can adjust to your preferences.

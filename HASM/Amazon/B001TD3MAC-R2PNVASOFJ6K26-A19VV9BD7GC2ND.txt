Title: poorly-designed, over-priced coffeemaker
Content:
Here are some cons about this coffeemaker:  it is expensive; for a 10-cup coffeemaker, it is very bulky / it takes up a large amount of counter space; as other reviewers have noted, the peculiar design of the lid and pour spout on the stainless steel carafe make it difficult to pour coffee without spilling.

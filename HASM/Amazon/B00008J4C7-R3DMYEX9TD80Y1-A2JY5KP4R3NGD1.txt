Title: Shark Roadster
Content:
I absolutely love my Shark Roadster.  After having used an upright vacuum on my carpets, I was amazed at the amount of dirt this vacuum sucked up.  It does need frequent emptying which I accomplish by dumping its contents, then using a ShopVac to clean the filter, which is FAR less trouble than Shark's "tap clean."  A BIG PROBLEM is that nobody handles the replacement filters.  Euro-Pro, if you're listening, please tell me where I can buy REPLACEMENT FILTERS!

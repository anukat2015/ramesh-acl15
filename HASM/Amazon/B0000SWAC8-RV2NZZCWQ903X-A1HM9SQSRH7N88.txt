Title: Great for home with different floor surfaces.
Content:
I bought this vacuum on sale so I got a good price.  I needed to replace an old upright...a basic $200 bag upright that lasted about 6 years.  I wanted to switch to a canister because I have multiple levels in my home with different floor types, rug, tile, wood and stairs.  I was getting to the point that I was tired of using the short hose attachment on my upright to clean 80% of my home and having it fall over all the time because of short reach.  I love using a canister style now and find it so much lighter and easier to use than my old upright.  Especially easy I like using my foot to turn it on, change from the floor attachment to the motorized carpet head and it drags behind easily.  No, it's not the "perfect" machine, and there are even more expensive models out there, but that doesn't mean they work any better or worse.  Considering I paid only a little over what a new upright would cost me, it was worth it.  I would have liked to have gotten a motorized furniture head for the price, like the Oxygen3, but I see I can buy this later if I want to.  I have 4 pets and it gets all the hair very nicely.  My old vacuum just went across the surface leaving alot of deep dirt behind as I saw when I replaced my old carpets.  So far I like this one very much and it is doing a good job.  I no longer find it annoying to drag out a vacuum to clean something.  I hope I get many years out of it.  So far so good.

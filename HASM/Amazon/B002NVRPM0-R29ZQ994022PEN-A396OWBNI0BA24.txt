Title: Works well if you do not have fully carpeted floors
Content:
If you live in a residence that is predominantly hardwood floor, this is one of the better vacuums - no make, that the best. The turbine-powered airbrush works well for moderately shaggy rugs and floors, and while it is not a cheap canister, it is money well spent. I have never sucked out so much dust. Dyson has always scored a very high mark for design and this is no exception. It is quite easy to dump all the dust out from the bin, and I prefer canister vacuums since they're easy to put away.
Get the Motorhead if you have fully carpeted floors. For me the Turbinehead is more than enough.

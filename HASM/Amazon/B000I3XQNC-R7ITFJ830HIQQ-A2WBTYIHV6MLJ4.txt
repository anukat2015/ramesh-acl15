Title: Great camera
Content:
This takes WONDERFUL pictures.  We recently visited Hawaii and brought back pictures that with enlargement, let us see things we couldn't see with the naked eye.  Great quality--no issues with shaking (though I like my coffee well enough) as reported by others.  Great rapid-fire succession shots.  I chose this product because of great reviews and recommendations in Consumer Reports.

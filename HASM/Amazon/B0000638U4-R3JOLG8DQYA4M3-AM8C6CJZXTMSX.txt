Title: Looks cool and really works
Content:
...The Delonghi Water-to-Air Portable Air conditioner is a great purchase.  It is the second portable air conditioner I own, and it is the best.  Quiet, efficient, easy to move, and easy to use... these are the things that make this unit superior to my cheapie.  It works with or without water when the outside temperature is below ninety, thus it stays on even when out of water.  Cheapie turns off once it fills with water, so if you forget to empty it, forget about cooling from cheapie.  Penguino works no matter what and it is very easy to fill.  Stylish and attractive, effective and efficient, I can't say enough about the Delonghi Penguino.  It costs a lot, but I can say from experience, it is worth it.

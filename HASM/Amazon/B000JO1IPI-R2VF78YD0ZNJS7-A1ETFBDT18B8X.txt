Title: Best electronic investment I've ever made
Content:
Aside from the unfortunate fact that you must use iTunes, I'm thrilled with my 80G iPod.  I was concerned about dropping that much money for one item, in case that the novelty would wear off and it would gather dust somewhere.  I keep it with me all the time (I HIGHLY suggest buying a good protective case for it - I bought a hard plastic case from iSkin that I'm very happy with).  I like the large capacity, so I can keep my entire music library, many podcasts and a bunch of audio books available at all times.  Other than learning the hard way how to use iTunes, and how to recover when the database crashes, I love my iPod, and have certainly got my money's worth.

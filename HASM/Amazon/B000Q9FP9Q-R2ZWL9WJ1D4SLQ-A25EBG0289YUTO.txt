Title: Really? You're kidding right?
Content:
I purchased this expecting to make the room slightly cooler at the very least I expected it to work as described.
However it doesn't make the room any cooler than a low powered fan using the lowest settings. I did everything as instructed and even bought a bag of ice to put in the water tray and still... not much cooler if cooler at all really than a low powered fan you can buy for $10 I can't recommend that ANYONE for ANY reason EVER buy this product.

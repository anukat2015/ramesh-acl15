Title: Great Little Heater
Content:
Have had this heater for about a month now.  Does a great job keeping my garage comfortable enough to work in when the outside temperature has been around 30 degrees.  Also bought it for emergency use if we lose power.  Should put out enough heat to keep our living room warm.  A local store used 2 of them last year for about a week while their power was out.  They did a great job and produced no odor indoors.

Title: my dyson 21 stowaway
Content:
This vacuum is great i was a little wearie of the price but glad i spent the money i have a small house so the short cord does not bother me the only cons are the wand and instructions used my old vacuum two times then went over the same area with the dyson and you would not even think my old one was working

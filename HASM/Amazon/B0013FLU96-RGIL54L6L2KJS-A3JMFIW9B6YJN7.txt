Title: How to make your Grandaughter ecstatic!
Content:
This was the best graduation gift anyone could receive. This MacBook Pro replaced a 4 year old Powerbook that took my Grandaughter through high school flawlessly. The new laptop has the old one in spades. Faster, more innovative, better OS, great reliability and many more features. Mac's are a little more expensive but well worth the price. Just not having to deal with Windows Vista says it all.

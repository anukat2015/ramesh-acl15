Title: Best little coffee maker
Content:
I've owned several of these little coffee makers over the years and have even taken it on vacation!  It brews a perfectly wonderful cup of coffee - I use a combination of 1/2 Maxwell House w/ caffeine and 1/2 Gevalia decaf (different flavors and strengths).  Use filtered water whenever possible so as not to ruin the heating elements with hard water deposits - you should do this  whenever making coffee anyway, since the water &quot;makes&quot; the coffee.  You can't go wrong with this little coffee maker - and the price is perfection.

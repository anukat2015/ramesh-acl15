Title: Good Deal
Content:
Got two of these for a small private school. We use one for hot water only, the other for coffee. They serve both teachers and parents on a daily basis. The 12-30 cups size is not too big, not too small - both of ours fit on a kitchen countertop underneath a standard height cupboard.  I find the two-handed spout design is safer and harder to mess up than one-handed designs. I did a fair amount of research before I purchased these, and we wanted something good that would last. I was encouraged by the other positive reviews I found, and the fact that these are made in USA was a plus too.  These are very sturdy, and I expect they will last for decades. On the downside, after about 4 hours, the coffee will start to taste burnt if left plugged in, and the plastic coffee strainer does let in a few more coffee grounds than a paper filter, but that's the nature of percolated coffee.  Nothing is perfect, but so far these have lived up to our expectations.  A good product that makes good reliable coffee at a good price.  Get two!  :-)

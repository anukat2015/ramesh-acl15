Title: Problems
Content:
This heater works very well and looks good. It seems to be a very high efficiency design. 
However!
When this heater arrived I found that one of the electric cord brackets was broken and this type of plastic is dificult to glue. I did not return it because I needed it now not in two weeks. The Amazon shipping box did not show signs of stress so I must assume the damage was caused before it was packed for shipping.
Also, the dial (switch) is positioned and marked in such a way it is difficult to see what setting you are switching to (400W or 800W) when it is on the floor.

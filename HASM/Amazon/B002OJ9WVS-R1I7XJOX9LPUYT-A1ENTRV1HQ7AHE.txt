Title: 5 stars!!     only flaw is....
Content:
Absolutely the very best vac on the market...pay the price up front and then have the mercedes benz of vacs for the REST OF YOUR LIFE. Yes pricey, but cost average it over 20 years!  No similar appliance from Sears or Target will last last 1/4 as long as this beautiful puppy. And the color is "I die".....baby blue...makes housework pretty! Martha listen up!  Only one flaw...power cord is 5 feet too short.

Title: Nikon D90
Content:
This is a very nice mid-level camera.  I did a side by side test of the Nikon D90 & the Cannon XSi.  Even though there was some evidence that the XSi might have produced better color I chose the D90 in the end.  The Nikon had a much higher quality feel.  It was constructed of more metal rather than plastic for the Cannon.  It seemed to be better balanced (center of gravity) and the most common buttons seemed to be more ergonomically positioned.  The user menus seemed to be more intuitive and typically had more options than the Cannon.

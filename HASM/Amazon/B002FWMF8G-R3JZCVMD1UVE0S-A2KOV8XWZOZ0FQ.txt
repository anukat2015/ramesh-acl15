Title: I love that I live in a time in history when this product exists!
Content:
This has quickly become one of my favorite kitchen appliances.  I used to make flavored coffee, banana, and oatmeal shakes for breakfast (don't knock it until you try it!) using the time consuming method of brewing a small pot of coffee in the coffee machine and then mixing everything together in a blender.  But I stopped making them awhile ago because it just took too much time and created too much of a mess to clean.  This little product is the perfect solution!
It's quite well designed and thought out, but still oh-so-simple.  It only takes about 3 minutes to brew and blend (not including the fun process of deciding what to put in each drink).  The included recipe book is outstanding... everything from traditional mocha frappes like Starbucks has, to more complex dessert and alcoholic frappes... and even tea frappes.  The variety is great.
The serving size is just right.  If you use the recommended recipes for example, the resulting drink fills a large beer mug.  My only wish was that the blending container was a little larger... not so you can have a bigger beverage, but because sometimes the ingredients fly out of the brew opening on the top when the blending process begins.  It's not a major issue though, as not much ever escapes.  And if I really wanted to, I guess I could just cut down on some of the ice so it makes a little less; that would avoid the problem.
This product is definitely one that every frozen frappe lover should own.  It's simple and fun.  And it would make an AMAZING gift!  Highly recommended.

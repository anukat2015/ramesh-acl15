Title: Cheap reliable heater
Content:
We've had two of these heaters for two winters now, and they have proved to be reliable and efficient space heaters.  They've done a great job of heating rooms in two unheated California apartments, at this point.  Put one in an enclosed space, and it heats it right up - put two in adjoining rooms to really keep things warm.  The only downside I'd mention is that they do quite a bit of whirring - not overly noticeable day-to-day, but definitely there.  They also put out a bit of that "heater" smell when you first turn them on.  They've survived two winters of being on every other day and still work like they did when they were new - we've had disappointing reliability experiences with other heaters, so it's nice to find a model you don't have to replace every year.  Overall, we have no complaints - especially for the price!

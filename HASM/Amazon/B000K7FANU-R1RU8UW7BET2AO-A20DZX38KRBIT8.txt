Title: Piece of garbage.
Content:
Where to begin.  This laptop is slow, heavy, unreliable and not a worthy desktop replacement.  The graphics card (intel chipset) is total garbage like every HP computer in general, the laptop gets really hot even while doing nothing, the performance level horrid and don't expect to get things done easily with this heavy hot box.  The wireless cards HP provides in their laptops and desktops will fail within two years if your lucky, so be sure to buy a wireless USB adapter with your HP laptop.  The resolution for a 17" screen is quite poor and grainy.  If you put the Dv9000 next to a 13.3, 15 or 17 " Macbook Pro the Hp looks like garbage.  Maybe it could be the cheap junk video card in the DV9000.  When watching videos full screen or even some videos half screen it skips and lags which just sucks.  The keyboard is ok with a lot of keys poorly placed so you may power down your system without knowing you did so in the middle of a task.  This takes me to my next issue with this laptop, the battery life.  You cannot trust the on screen battery indicator because I have had this piece of trash completely shutdown with 50% battery life.  Over all this laptop is a cheap piece of junk from HP, and when it fails you (and it will in no time) don't expect HP to back up their product because they know they sold you crap. Avoid.

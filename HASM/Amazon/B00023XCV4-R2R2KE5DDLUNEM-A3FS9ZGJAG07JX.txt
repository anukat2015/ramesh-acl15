Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
This is the first time I have ever purchased an electric Percolator other than a Farberware.  Since I only use the 12-cup for occasional company I didn't want to spend the price that they wanted for the 12 cup Farberware.  I am extremely pleased with this model.  Everything about it is great; the coffee is excellent and the pot makes coffee equally as fast as my old 12 cup Farberware and for a lot less money.

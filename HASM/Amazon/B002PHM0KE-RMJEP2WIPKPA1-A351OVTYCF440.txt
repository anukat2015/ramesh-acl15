Title: POOR WARRANTY SERVICE
Content:
Keys of the VAIO laptop started coming out within a few months of purchase.  I called SONY helpline (1-800-4-VAIOPC) and they said they will send someone to repair onsite and asked me to fax the receipt.  Next day someone called me back and told me to send it to their repair facility in San Diego.  I did.  Three days later, I got a call  from the repair center and said that this repair is not covered and I have to pay $181 for the repair.  I told them it should be covered under warranty.  They refused and returned the laptop without repair.

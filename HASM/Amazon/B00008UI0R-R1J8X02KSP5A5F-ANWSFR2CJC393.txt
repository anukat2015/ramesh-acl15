Title: Great vacum!
Content:
One of the best vacums I've used, this canister style dust fighting machine follows you around like a puppy.  The large wheels seem to make it roll over floor threshholds and it's own cord very easily.  Rarely tips over, but on the few occasions it did, there was no interrpution in power as I have seen with other vacums.  The controls are located on the handle which is very convienent.  It has three (3) levels of suction power although for the most part I have just been using the strongest level.  Not sure why you would want lesser power - perhaps on curtains or something along those lines.  Agitator in the power head makes movement pretty easy.  You don't have to be the "World's Strongest" to use it.  Emptying the dirt is pretty easy.  I just remove the dirt canister, turn it upside down in a empty trash bag and shake it.  You will see some dust which is too be expected.  Only negative is with the retractable cord as it rarely retracts all the way without some cord handling.  It is, however, pretty much the same issue I have seen on all retractable cords.  Excellent vacum - I highly recommend it.

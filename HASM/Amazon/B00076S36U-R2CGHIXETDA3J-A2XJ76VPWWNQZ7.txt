Title: Need help
Content:
I purchased this heater and recieved it a few days ago. It was just the size I wanted and needed. We put it together and let it sit filled as instructed, There was a horrible kerosene burning ordor. I contacted the company, they told me to compleatly burn it out and fill it this will take care of the ordor. It didn't. I contacted them again and told me to buy a kerosene additive . I did this and the ordor was worse. Can anyone help me with this product?

Title: on demand review
Content:
I've had this style of coffee maker for almost two years now.  Despite the fact that it just died from causes unknown, I'd suggest this item to those who do not like the burnt taste that most coffee makers leave behind after a short time.  (I'm ordering a new one!)  I've experimented with many brands, sizes, & types and this one rules.  There are a few drawbacks.  The water spillage issue that one reviewer mentioned is true, however I figured out what it took after a few pots.  The amount of space given for cups does not allow you to fill large cups, travel mugs, or carafes easily.  You must remove the drip tray for that function.  Lastly, I think cuisinart would do well to add a light near the cup area because I've found that you cannot see the fluid level early in the morning when the lights are low.  But that is just me.

Title: the one and only review
Content:
This is a great vacuum...the hose is long, the electric cord is long, the attachments are great. It took no effort to assemble and the power is awesome. I was able to pick up everything seen and could not see. I have owned a dyson animal and the comparison is great....the Bissell 3920 pet hair eraser is easier to handle, but you have to empty the container more often...but who is counting as long as the job is done at the fraction of the cost. I recommend this vacuum to everyone!!!

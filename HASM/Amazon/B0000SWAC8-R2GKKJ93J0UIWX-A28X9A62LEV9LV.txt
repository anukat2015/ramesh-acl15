Title: frustrating
Content:
I did a lot of research before purchasing a vacuum.  I had reservations about ordering on-line because of the inconvenience of returning the item.  This vacuum is just kind-of ok.  A part on the handle broke immediately and had to be duct taped together.  Would I buy another?  No  Would I order another appliance on-line?  Definately, no.

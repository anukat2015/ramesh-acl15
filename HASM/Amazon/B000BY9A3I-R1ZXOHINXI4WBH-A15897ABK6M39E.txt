Title: Buy It!
Content:
This is my first canister type vacuum cleaner and I'm completely impressed. The vacuum cleaners that I've owned in the past had less suction power and were much louder. This one purrs at the slide of the handle and has great suction power for fine animal hair. The retractable cord is convenient and the slide on  the handle for the suction control is great as well. 
The only thing that I can think of that might be off is that it's advertised as lightweight and I really didn't feel that it was but to be fair this is my first canister vacuum cleaner so I really have no comparison to go by. I ordered this mainly so that I can vacuum the stair cases because my old vacuum cleaner doesn't have any attachments. This vacuum cleaner comes with an abundance of attachments and so far my favorite one is the turbo floor attachment. I also was pleased that I was able to get a vacuum that has the HEPA filter. The dust cup is easy to empty and holds a decent amount of dust.
Overall, I rate this vacuum cleaner five stars because it exceeded my expectations for the price that I paid.

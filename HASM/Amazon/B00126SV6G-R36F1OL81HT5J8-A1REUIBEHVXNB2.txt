Title: SONG DEGEN
Content:
I have had many problems with this player. First off if you let it die then you have to precharge it for like 30 mins till u are able to actually start charging it. 
and the worst part is the song degen. Or in other words the song quality over time fails utterly. 
Would u recommend it NO I would fork out the extra $$ and buy an Ipod
Sorry Creative but if they would make a better product I would be more inclined to give a better review.

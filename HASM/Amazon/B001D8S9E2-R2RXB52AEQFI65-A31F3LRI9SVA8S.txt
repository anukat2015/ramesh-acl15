Title: A very Good Laptop, but no Firewire is a No No No.
Content:
The best Laptop I have ever bought.  Multitouch trackpad is very usable.  Runs very fast.  Feels tight in your hands.
BUT
If you are buying this Laptop for edditing be informed that this one doesn't come with any Firewire Port.  If you are the kind of person who likes to connect your DV camera to edit your video, you will see that Apple just decided that you will not need to do that anymore.  A stupid decision I think.

Title: Great Little canister vacuum
Content:
This small and lightweight vacuum this ideal for our new oak floors. I would recommend it to anyone. It is very powerful for it's size. Onr drawback is the quality of the yellow brush attachment is not good. I have to use one from another vacuum. Otherwise if you have wood floors it is GREAT! Rita from Wi,

Title: Best Computer I have ever owned
Content:
Macintosh has done an excellent job. This is my first Mac after having owned systems with Windows since the days of Windows 3.1.
The Mac OS is extremely intuitive and operates quickly. My main reason for not purchasing a Mac over the years has been the price difference. I would have to admit now that you get what you pay for and my experience will lead me to replace other PC's in my home with Macs.

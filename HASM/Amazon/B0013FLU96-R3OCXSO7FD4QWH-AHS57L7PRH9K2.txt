Title: Don't hesitate
Content:
The price may be a bit daunting for some but it's well worth it.  Even so, Apple has recently announced price cuts on Macbooks, Macbook Pro's and Macbook Air. Also, the OSX 10.6 named "Snow Leopard" will only cost existing OSX 10.5 owners $29 for the upgrade when it's available in Oct. 2009.
Very high quality all around. I can't say enough good things that haven't already been said. Go get it. You know you want it.

Title: Great Camera- Terrible shipping
Content:
The Nikon D200 is an amazing camera. This review is about Amazon packing procedures.
This review is to alert prospective buyers that Amazon does not pack these cameras well. I just purchased one and it came packed like a book, with very little padding. I called Nikon and their recommendation was to return the item pronto. I have returned the camera (with much trepidation)and will purchase from another trusted source. Just wanted to give you all a heads up.

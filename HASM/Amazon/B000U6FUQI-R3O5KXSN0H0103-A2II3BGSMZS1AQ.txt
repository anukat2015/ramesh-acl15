Title: Great little vacuum!
Content:
I decided to try this vacuum because I own 6 parrots and they are constantly throwing food and losing feathers.  I feed them a pellet diet, which is similar in size and weight to small dog food.  The vacuum is able to pick up most of the pellets without difficulty, even if some lands on the throw rugs around the cages.  It effortlessly sucks up the dust and dander on my hard wood floors.  Although I wish for a bit more suction on the biggest of the pellets, this is the best vacuum I've had yet for this purpose.

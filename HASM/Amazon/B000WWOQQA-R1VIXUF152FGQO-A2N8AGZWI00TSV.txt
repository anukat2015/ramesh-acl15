Title: Nice when it was working
Content:
After approximately 2 years of use, you will have a very expensive door stop. I purchased this laptop at the same time I purchased a DELL Inspiron. The Inspiron is still as good as new while the HP died about 2 months back and Hp support is no help! Do youreself a favor and avoid spending any of your hard earned money on this soon to be paper weight.

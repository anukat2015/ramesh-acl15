Title: Time to buy heaters now
Content:
The theory behind this method of heating is convection/radiant heat. Elements in the bottom heat oil which circulates through tubes which get quite hot and radiate warmth. Aside from clickings from the thermostat, it is silent. It is slow to warm a larger area because it's relying on thermodynamics rather than a forced fan but will eventually do the job and do it quietly and well. I have two of them, one a fancy digital controlled model with timers, the other a no frills basic model. Both were made in Italy and have been trouble free. A friend bought a more recent basic model and it was from China and a little poorer in quality and smelled bad for a long time so pay more if you can find an Italian one. Great solution for heating medium sized rooms when you don't need to run the central system.

Title: Keurig B-70
Content:
We love the Keurig concept for coffee making.  One cup at a time, and the coffee is always fresh!  We have this same model, and bought one for a friend that was leaving middle Georgia to go to Colorado.  She loved the coffee maker, so we bought her one to remember us by.  My wife and I love "strong" coffee, and we've found several that are "bold" enough to make a "full" cup of coffee.  Most of the flavored coffees (great in the late afternoon as a "pick-me-up) we use, we select the smaller cup size so that we can enjoy the full flavor.  This is a great product, and Amazon is one of the better places (price wise) to buy the coffee too!

Title: Amazing DSLR for avid amateur photographers
Content:
I've had this camera for just over a month now and have been taking photos like a madman. This is a testament to its ease of use and intuitive features. I can't wait to get more acquainted with the "live view" and "video" functions since both were reasons for choosing this particular model. Here's a tip: add a battery grip to give the camera more substance and consider finding a better flash for serious photography. All in all, this camera is just what I needed as an avid, amateur photographer.

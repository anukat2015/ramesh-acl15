Title: Fantastic Vacuum - but be ready...
Content:
This vacuum is incredible. The assembly instructions aren't great, but it's super easy to put together. 
We've bought a half-dozen vaccums in the past couple years, but none were tough enough to handle our cats. We had high hopes and low expectations as we started up this Bissell, and were astounded ... absolutely astounded by how much it picked up. And kept picking up. 
Be ready when you run this, you're gonna need a bunch of garbage sacks to hold all the hair and junk you get out of the carpet. It quickly became everyone's favorite electronic toy - the Xbox got turned off so folks could actually go run the vacuum. 
The noise isn't any worse than any other vacuum, and the controls are easy. I highly recommend this Bissell Pet Hair Eraser, it's not just good value for the money, but it's the best thing you can do for your cat-home.

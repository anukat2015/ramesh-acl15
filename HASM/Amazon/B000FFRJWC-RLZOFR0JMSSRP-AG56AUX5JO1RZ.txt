Title: I wouldn't recommend this one
Content:
The Eureka Uno isn't a very good cleaner. The hose between the motor and the brush clogs easily. There is insufficient suction to lift dirt and I'm not sure what the brush is doing, but dirt stays on the carpet even after many passes. I'm sorry I bought this one.

Title: Enjoy the subtle flavors in your fine-roasted beans!
Content:
This is a perfect coffee maker. Not only is it stylish, you can immediately tell that it is quality made when you see and handle it. Plus, unlike nearly every coffee maker, the carafe doesn't drip all over the place as you fill the tank or pour your cup. Yet, the greatest difference is in the taste of the coffee. I only drink a particular roaster's master blend, so my first pot was made using the same bean as I've always used; the same burr grinder; and the same amount of grounds. I was amazed how so many of the subtle flavors came rushing to the front of my first sip and continued to be really well balanced as I drank myself into the jitters with enjoyment. As I have continued to use this machine, I've yet to have a problem with it, nor have I had any overspills that other reviewers experienced. So my advice is: if your making a pot of Caribou or Starbuck's, this might not be the machine for you, but if you tend to walk past most coffee shops to get to where the finest coffee is brewed, than the Capresso MT500 Plus is a must for your kitchen and well worth the price.

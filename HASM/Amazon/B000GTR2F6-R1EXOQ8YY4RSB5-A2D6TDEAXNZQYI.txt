Title: Great for small offices - Excellent customer service
Content:
A number of years ago, in a medium sized office, we had a Keurig brewing system that was great for giving everyone a choice of coffees and absolutely eliminating wasted pots of coffee.  Overall, the quality of what we drank went way up, and waste went down, cost... well, it probably cost a little more and had to be hooked up to the water supply and was supplied through a commercial service.  Which made it uneconomic for a small office of just a few people that did not want a service contract, plumbling work, etc.
Now, however, Keurig has seen the small office/home market and has met the need very very well.  Same high quality coffees in single cup services that eliminates waste, but in a machine you buy and fill yourself with tap or bottled water.  It still costs more than brewing a pot of coffee, but it definitely gives you more choices for yourself and your clients, and eliminates the waste in making a pot, and then letting it sit until it's cold or undrinkable.
It's simple to use and fast.  If you want to make coffee and tea for several people, it takes no longer, really, than making a pot from scratch.  The cost of the consumables runs around $0.50 per cup, though you can sometimes do better.  That's far cheaper than walking over to Starbucks, though these machines don't really do a cappuchino, but more expensive than a pound of Folgers.  
I've had one of these in my office for three months and have loved it!  I had a service problem, which Keurig's friendly, articulate and helpful customer services representatives resolved immediately and cheerfully.  I give them as high marks for service as for the machine itself!

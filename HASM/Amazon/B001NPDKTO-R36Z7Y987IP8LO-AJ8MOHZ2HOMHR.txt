Title: This is a great laptop!!!!!
Content:
This is a great laptop.  It is very fast and easy to use.  The picture is very vivid.  The fan is very quiet and the computer stays cool. I love the scroll bar on the mouse pad, I use it all the time. I read alot of reviews and this one didn't have one yet and decided to take a chance seeing that it had a great processor and 500 GB hard drive at a great price.  It was very easy to set up with the wireless router that we also purchased from Amazon.   The only problem I have is that my daughter wants to use it all the time and I can't get on it.   Thanks HP for a great computer and thanks Amazon for offering it at a great price.

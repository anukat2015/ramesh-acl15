Title: Would rate even higher if I could!!
Content:
I got this as a Christmas gift for my mom. Her old coffee broke down so she got this before Christmas and we love it! I bought it for her and then got on Amazon to look at the reviews and got worried about only three stars and people talking about the different issues they have had with this coffee system.  We have been using it for two weeks now with none of the issues other people are talking about (i.e. leaking, filter trouble, etc.)  But we did do something some people may not have tried before using this product-we read through the entire manual before we did anything.  Maybe this has made all the difference.  My mom and I are both die hard coffee drinkers and have never had a better cup of coffee!!  The fresh grind feature is incredible, put in fresh coffee beans, set the timer and viola-wake up in the morning to the freshest cup of coffee you have ever had.  My mother is kind of a clean freak and has always washed out her coffee pots daily, so this suggestion from the manufacturer is no biggee and well worth the effort.  The only scary aspect of this product is the intimidating price, but if the coffee lives up to cuisinart durability, or only lasts for five years it is well worth the price.  We have also used the standard pre-ground coffee option and like it almost as well, product delivered-but once you get a taste of fresh ground coffee there is no going back.  I am now officially a coffee snob.

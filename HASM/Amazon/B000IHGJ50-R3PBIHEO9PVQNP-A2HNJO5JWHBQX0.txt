Title: Is what it is, and does a good job
Content:
The iPod shuffle is a great iPod in that it's built for simplicity while exercising or working outside.  It's lightweight and clips on very easily.  No, it doesn't play video, have a touch screen, etc., but that's not what it's made for.  It's made for listening on the go.  So yes, it's the old version, but it's a great one, and we love the one we have and highly recommend it.

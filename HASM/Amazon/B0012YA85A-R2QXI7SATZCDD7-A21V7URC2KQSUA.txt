Title: Big Things Come in Small Packages
Content:
I have to say, I am totally and utterly in love with my camera. I bought this beauty in Feb of this year (2009). I bought it along with a couple of lenses and a speedlight. It is very easy to learn on. The camera takes wonderful photo's. Any issues have been totally user related. That camera does exactly what it is told to do. The software it comes with is easy to use.  What more can I say, I just LOVE it!

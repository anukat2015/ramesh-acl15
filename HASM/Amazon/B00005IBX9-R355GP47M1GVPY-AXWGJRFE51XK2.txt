Title: We've had this for almost a year - pros & cons
Content:
We bought this coffee maker in January or February of this year, and it worked really well and made great coffee for quite awhile. Then we moved to a more rural area and are on well water. We have a brand new, state-of-the-art water treatment center in the house and our water is soft, so we shouldn't have scaling. 
After 4 months of living here and typically making between 1/3 and 1/2 a pot of coffee a day (and occasionally in the evening), the self-clean light started flashing and the coffee tasted terrible. We followed the directions and ran the vinegar-water mixture through the machine to clean it - we even did it twice to be extra-thorough.  The coffee tasted great again for about 2 pots, and then the light started flashing again.  We've been having this back & forth for about a month now and I've resorted to looking for a new machine -- we're going through 2 gallons of vinegar a week just for cleanings. Last night I cleaned the machine twice and my husband had delicious coffee this morning. However, when I brewed 1/3 pot later this morning, the self-clean button was flashing again.  Since we live on well water, and the water has been recently tested, we should not be having these problems. 
On the pro-side, when the machine works, it works well. We like the little 1-4 cup lever since we don't make lots of coffee at once (I'm pregnant so drink decaf and my husband still drinks regular). The timer is great and the machine is attractive, plus it's nice to be able to set the heat temperature of the burner.  And it's nice that the machine tells you when it needs to be de-scaled -- I just think there's something defective with ours.

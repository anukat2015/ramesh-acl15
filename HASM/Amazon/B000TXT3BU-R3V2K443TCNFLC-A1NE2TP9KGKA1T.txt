Title: The Workhorse Reborn
Content:
I've always been a fan of the Dell D600 (and D610) since I first used them at work. These units are true workhorses that never let you down, regardless of the application used on them. So when it came time to order a laptop for my son for his impending college trek,the choice was easy. 
I know, buying a refurbished anything is a crapshoot, but not so with this laptop. the unit actually came to me looking better than described and performs flawlessly. My son's happy...I'm happy...you'll be happy, too and save some cash to boot!
NOTE: The unit does come with Windows XP but NOT with Office, thus the 4-star rating.

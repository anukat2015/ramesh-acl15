Title: A terrific buy, especially under $600.
Content:
First, a disclaimer: I've only been using this computer for one week, but I have been putting it through its paces already.
Information I didn't find in the product specs: the installed Windows 7 Home Edition is the 64 bit version; a most definite plus.
This is a great laptop. I used it to replace a 3 year old laptop that ceased to function. The speed and graphics on this build are well beyond what is expected for the price. The graphics card is highly capable, allowing me to play D&D Online (Standard Res) without issues. I am watching high-res movies and doing other tasks (browsing the internet, running an email client, etc.) without any slowing in the system. Another good surprise was the standard laptop speakers; they have terrific sound well beyond anything I have heard from a laptop before. The web cam and built-in microphone are very good as well.
As for cons, I have 3. The first is the huge software bundle the system comes loaded with: it took a while to go through and uninstall what was not useful. Second is that the cd/dvd drive eject button is oddly placed and not sensitive and makes it somewhat more difficult to use than it should be. I have a similar issue with the slide button to open the laptop as well, but it is not quite as annoying.
I am extraordinarily pleased with this purchase. It was much more than I expected to get and I continue to love this system.

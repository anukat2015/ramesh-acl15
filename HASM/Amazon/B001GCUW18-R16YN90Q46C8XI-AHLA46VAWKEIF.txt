Title: The voice of experience.
Content:
I have been using this computer for 6 to 12 hours a day for 17 months.  When I received it it had a bad RAM chip, which took a month and a half to get replaced.  Then they sent a stick of desktop ram (which HP let me keep).  That is the end of my complaints.  This has been a stellar machine, I use it heavily, including some gaming.  This is no gaming laptop, but I have run Half Life 2 on higher settings with no problems.  It runs hot, most laptops do.
All in all, a very good laptop, and at these prices, a great laptop (though I wouldn't put it on my lap for long).

Title: This camera Rocks!
Content:
I am an ammeter photographer and take about 3000 photos a year.  I have owned this camera for 2.5 years and could carry it with me 24x7.  I know that there are better cameras but for the money you will have a hard time proving that this is not the best.   I had some off brand lenses and do not like them as much as the Canon equipment and am looking to invest in my first image stabilized lens.  You can get the XTi (10M pixel) but the cost vs. pay off is not as good as the XT.   Each photo is about 2.5M and with a 2 Gig card you can take about 500 photos before you have to off load.  At that resolution I can print 8.5X11 photos and you will have a hard time believing that the picture did not come from a 35mm camera.  The only bad thing is that you may have to by a new hard drive to fit all your new data.  This camera is very good for the beginner who wants to learn or just point and shoot. 
Happy shooting

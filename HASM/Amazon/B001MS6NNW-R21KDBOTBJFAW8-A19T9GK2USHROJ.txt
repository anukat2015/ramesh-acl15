Title: Awesome Design, technical specs, and medium cost!
Content:
"Beautiful! Great performance and Blue-Ray w/HD display!"
Pros: Fast and beautiful design. My first Chiclet keyboard and I love it! the screen is WOW! and the design is awesome
Cons: SLOW Hard drive. I'll soon be replacing with a 250GB SSD and that should make this machine scream! Battery life a bit short...I'll be buying the larger battery cause at times I want more and having a second would be even better!
Summary: Great laptop for the price. Best purchase of a computer in a long time and I have 6 laptops in the family! This one is mine!

Title: Very high quality vacuum
Content:
I just bought this vacuum a couple weeks ago and so far I am very pleased with it.  We were surprised to see just how small it really is.  We live in a small house (1300 sq ft) and have a big newf, 2 cats, and a bird that loves to toss his food on the floor.  The whole house has hard floors, laminate and tile.  On the lowest setting, this vac has the power to clean the floor effortlessly.  Max power is just overkill.  This is a new model made to work with hard floor or low carpet.  No problem with rugs either, just step on the button on the business end and the brushes retract.  It is really clever.  It even has 2 slots to stand up the wand so you dont have to lay it on the floor.  The best thing about it is the noise factor.  I used it the other night to vacuum on 50% power and talked on the phone the whole time.  It just sounds like a fan.  Amazing!  Here is the list of pros and cons;
Pros
Extremely quiet
Very compact
Very light
Well built
Useful accessories
Turbobrush is great for hard floor and rugs
Casters are rubber coated and roll smooth
Wand is steel and retractable
Retractable cord
Cons
Only 1, the cord needs to be about 10 longer.  I understand why its short though, due to the small frame size there isnt alot of room for a long

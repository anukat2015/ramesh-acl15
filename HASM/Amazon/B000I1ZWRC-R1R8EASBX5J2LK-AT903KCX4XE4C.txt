Title: Great Camera...  Will Update Review After More Use
Content:
I am using this camera with the Tamron SP AF17-50mm F/2.8 lens and all I can say is I am blown away by the quality.  Granted, I am comparing to my 3-year old Canon Digital Elph and not against "professional" cameras and lenses, but this is nice rig to shoot with.   Great results.  Enjoy!

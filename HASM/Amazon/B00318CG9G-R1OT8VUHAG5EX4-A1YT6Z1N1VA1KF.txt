Title: Overall A Very Good Value
Content:
HP 2150us - Pros - Super fast processor.  Simple things like opening the contral panel to access add/remove programs only takes a second or two. All the programs appear immediately. I had to wait on my last computer for the programs to load. Everything moves very fast.  Attractive gloss black that surprisingly doesn't pick up fingerprints and smudges as fast as I feared. When they do appear, they rub off easily.
 
Cons- the keyboard - don't know exactly what's different but after 2 weeks of heavy daily use, I'm still not adjusted to it. It feels like it's layout is one key too far to the left causing your fingers to land on the wrong keys. It is much different from the HP I replaced. Also the sound is very weak. It is hard to hear unless the volume is pushed up much farther on the scale than I am used to doing. 
I moved from XP to Windows 7 and am still flubbing around trying to find everything but the computer itself is a great product and a very good buy.

Title: not really portable - beware
Content:
This product is advertised as being portable, but it must be attached to a window vent to work. It also won't work with a sliding glass door. So it's not portable.  When I called to complain, the customer support supervisor would not give me contact information for higher management.  She wanted my name and contact information instead. 
Buyers should also know that Amana is now owned by Haier, which is owned in part by the government of the People's Republic of China.

Title: Great set of features for an unbeatable price
Content:
I've been using this camera for about a year and a half and have previously owned multiple point and shoot digital canon cameras.  This camera allows a level of creativity unavailable with the other cameras.  I have taken numerous pictures that people have asked "Where did you get that print?"  It is easy to use but has all the power you would expect from a SLR.  I didn't buy the kit lens and opted for some higher quality lenses that have served me very well. 
Since others have listed pros and cons very well here are the highlights for me:
Pros:
SLR
400+ shots on a single charge
Fast shutter release
Expandability
Cons:
Doesn't fit in your pocket

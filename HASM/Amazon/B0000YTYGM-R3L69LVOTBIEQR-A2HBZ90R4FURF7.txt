Title: DO NOT BUY THIS
Content:
This thing is awful.  In my opinion, if one grind makes it through your filter or if the planets don't line up in a million other ways it just spits coffee and grinds out all over your counter.  I've actually used 2 of these, they both are exactly as bad as one another and anyone considering this item should buy anything else.  You couldn't make a worse choice than this one.  I would prefer a hammer, beans and a boiling pot of water.

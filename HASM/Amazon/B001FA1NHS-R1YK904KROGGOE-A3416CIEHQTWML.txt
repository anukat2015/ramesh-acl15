Title: I-Pod Nano 4th Generation
Content:
I love my new I-Pod Nano, I had the shuffle, but it didn't hold enough songs so I upgraded to Nano. The quality of sound is great. I have downloaded every CD I had in the house. Now I will have to raid the kids' CD's. It will be great to have on vacation.

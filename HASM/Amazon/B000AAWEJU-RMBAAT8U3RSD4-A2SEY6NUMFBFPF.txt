Title: Perfect for apartments and small houses
Content:
We live in a cottage with a dog, and the indoor air quality was getting so bad that I couldn't breathe at night (and I don't have allergies to anything). The old canister vac was pretty ineffective, and the worn-out cord was a fire hazard.
This canister vac, while a little expensive for the price tag, is such a fantastic replacement. I debated going down to Sears or Target and just picking up a hundred dollar vac like I've done many a time before, but they always disappoint me.
The operation of the Carina is smooth and extraordinarily quiet (the dog no longer hides when the vacuum is running). I upgraded to the optional HEPA filter and the exhaust air, while not pine-fresh, smells clean. A few basic attachments were enough to get window sills, shelves, crown molding, and floors done. It picked up enough dirt, dust, and dog hair that I can finally sleep soundly at night.
There's just one problem, which I have seen mentioned elsewhere -- short power cord (hence 4 stars instead of 5). This machine isn't going to work as well in suburbia; it's a compact machine for compact spaces, and probably more suitable for urban dwellers. I had to replug when moving from the kitchen to the bedroom, but otherwise, it worked great.

Title: Ok, not a bad machine
Content:
A good buy. Worth the $549.95 price tag (at the time). The first thing you notice about the Acer AS5810TZ-4274 is it's weight. It's lighter than the average notebook and also thinner as well. The display is bright and offers great colour while watching DVDs. Battery life is great; I got almost 9 hours out of it with Wifi off watching one 97 minute DVD and doing basic stuff using apps. I got just over 7 hours browsing the web with Wifi turned on. It has worked well so far, being able to handle anything I've done with it. The touchpad is a nice touch. I'm able to resize almost anything that's on the display. I can even resize web pages in any browser with a pinch. The CPU fan is super quiet; you don't even hear it running, not ever. The built-in webcam is not perfect, but not bad either; it serves the purpose. Likewise the speakers.
Unfortunately, there is no one-touch backup button as stated in the descrition. There is also no Wifi on/off button. Actually, the range of buttons that are supposed to provide shortcut to various functions are just indicators, letting the user knows these specific functions are in operation.
The Intel SU2700 is 1.3Ghz which works ok, but if you have too many apps loaded or doing too many things at once it goes into slug mode. The AS5810TZ-4274 does not run as hot as other notebooks I've owned, but the temperature is still noticeable when used on your lap.
All-in-all, it's a good buy.

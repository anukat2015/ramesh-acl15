Title: Powerful little vacuum
Content:
This little vacuum is as powerful as it claims to be.  It cleans bare floors and low-pile carpet or woven rugs.  Also does a great job of getting pet hair off of upolstered furniture.   It would be easier to hold on to if the wand was about 1/2 inch smaller in diameter but that might affect the suction. I have put a few wide rubberbands around the handle for a better grip as the plastic is slippery. I like to carry it while I vacuum and it certainly is light enough. The cord is a little short but that's not as important as the other features. I have not yet purchased  bags so I can't say how difficult to find or expesive they are. I would recommend this as a very good product at a very good price. This is exactly what I was looking for.

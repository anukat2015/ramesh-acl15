Title: Warm, quiet and versatile
Content:
We have had this heater for a week now and love it. It has been wheeled from room to room (large bedroom, small office, kitchen, living room) and done the job consistently in all spaces. Very quiet and heats up quickly. Although it warms the room, it is still cool enough to touch which is good if you have small children. The wheels make it easy to move... but it is also extremely lightweight for carrying up and down stairs. I think my only complaint would be it is hard to tell from across the room if it is on or not. The orange light only seems to indicate power to the unit, not on/off status. Also, it is difficult to change the settings in the dark since there is no digital or lit display for the knobs.

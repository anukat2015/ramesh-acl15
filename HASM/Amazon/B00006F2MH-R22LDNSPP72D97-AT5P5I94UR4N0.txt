Title: a great coffeemaker for the price
Content:
I read a lot of negative reviews about this coffeemaker before I bought it, but I bought it anyway.  I'm glad I did - I love it!  Sure, the grinder's loud, but what grinder isn't?  It doesn't spray coffee grounds like others do, and it's pretty easy to clean...all you have to do is remove it and rinse with water.  The 1-4 cup option makes the coffee hotter than any other pot I've had.  It took awhile to get used to all the parts (I'm not too crazy about the design of the coffee filter/lid), but it was definitely worth the money to have the smell of fresh coffee fill the house every morning. Now I love deciding what blend of coffee I'm going to brew the next morning - it's become a ritual.

Title: NOT A GOOD CHOICE
Content:
I own several Black & Decker products and have always been happy with them, but I feel compelled to echo other writers. While the coffee it makes is flavorful, it does not get hot enough and the carafe leaks BADLY. Every time I tried to pour a cup of coffee, no matter how carefully or slowly I poured, coffee leaked all over the counter. This machine is definitely going back.

Title: Little heater
Content:
The little heater does a good job in a normal room size.  I tryed it in my open concept down stairs and it worked ok, took the chil off the room.  I have a heat pump, so when it gets really cold the pump can't keep up in this north east weather.  The only draw back is that it uses a lot of electricity.  I use it spairingly.  But it is nice to have on those cold winter nights.
I would recommend it to anyone as a back up, or added comfort.

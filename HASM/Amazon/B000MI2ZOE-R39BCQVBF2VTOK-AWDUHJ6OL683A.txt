Title: Great unit but the hose is terrible!
Content:
Prior to purchasing this unit we bought another brand portable A/C unit at Home Depot. It gave us nothing but problems. It leaked and ruined the rug in the bedroom. It would shut off when the cup for the water was full, which happened about once an hour in the Dehumidify mode. We returned it and purchased the Penguino 10,000 BTU. It works great in all modes. We use the dehumidify mode most often and it does its job. The air blows cold and keeps us comfortable. My only gripe is that, as mentioned elsewhere, you do have to find some way to stabilize the window set-up. I have mine duct taped in the window. The hose is plastic but not very pliable. I could not get the end to screw into the unit or the hose. Same with the window end so, that too, also has a large amount of duct tape around it. I will say that if I was in the market for another portable A/C unit, I would purchase again. I have had it for a year and have had it running every day,and it is still working fine. I did purchase the extended warranty as a precaution and 3 years for $30 seems worth it to me. Oh, and I LOVE not having to empty the water out of the unit :)

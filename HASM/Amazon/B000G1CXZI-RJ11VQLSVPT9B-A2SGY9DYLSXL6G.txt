Title: Works Great
Content:
I have a room in the house that's at the "end of the run" for the furnace. This heater worked great to keep the room as warm as the rest of the house.  The Temp setting, and Timer option allowed me to only run at night (when it gets colder) without having to remember to turn it on/off every day.  On the low setting, it keep the room warm, but was not too hot to touch (so the kids would not burn themselves on it).

Title: Completely annoying accelometer!
Content:
This great piece of technology has been ruined by this stupid shake thing Apple decided to add to the device.  I was doing bench press at the gym so the Ipod switched modes because I was laying down.  Some crappy song came on and I was UNABLE to lower the volume because the stupid accelerometer changed modes. What a pain in the neck! Its going back! Who needs to shake their ipod to change songs anyways?!  Ridiculous! And no, you cannot shut off this feature.  Somebody else wrote the 5-star reviews are from Apple employees and I agree, they must be.

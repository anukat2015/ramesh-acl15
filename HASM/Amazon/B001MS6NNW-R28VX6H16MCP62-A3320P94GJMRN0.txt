Title: Pretty Good Pricy Choice
Content:
I almost bought Dell studio 17", but a lot of reviews said troubles with disk drive and one other thing (I don't remember). Some said they can be fixed. I don't want to fix anything after I paid for a brand new machine. Manufacturer needs to see that fixing is not required by the user; it is his responsibility. So I went for Sony VGN-FW370J which is 0.6 short of 17". A bit pricy like a salesman from Best Buy said "You are paying for the name". I could have got a laptop with similiar capability for some $300 less. I like the stylish design and color and the specifications. I bought this one to supplement my existing 3 years old HP dv6000 15.4" which is giving some trouble with wireless reception. Works OK with ethernet connected. Sony laptop is great and I don't regret that I bought it. Wireless picked up real fast and I like it. A couple of cons I came through in one month. One time screen went all black in the middle of work and I had to restart. On another occassion, screen changed to black and white stripes also in the middle of work but went away after restart. So I must be careful to save my work. I don't know if it can be fixed and I have not contacted Sony. I am a right hander and use wireless mouse. This machine has all USB ports  near the front right side which kind of hinders my mouse hand movements. Well, I have learned to live with one or the other shortcomings of all electronic consumer products. Other than those, this is a great machine worth investing.

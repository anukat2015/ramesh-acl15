Title: I love this vacuum!
Content:
This vacuum is wonderful. Great suction, easy to maneuver, nice design. Useful & easy to change attachments. We purchased it because of its number 2 ranking by Consumer Reports and all the good reviews on Amazon. More expensive than what we were planning to spend, but well worth it. Highly recommended.

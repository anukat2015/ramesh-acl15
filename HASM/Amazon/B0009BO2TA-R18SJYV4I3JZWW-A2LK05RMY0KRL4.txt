Title: I curse this thing every time I use it
Content:
Yes, it's cute. Yes, it's portable. No, I didn't expect a whole lot of suction, but this is what we bought because we were on a tight budget and also had very little storage space in our new home. Why do I curse it, every time I use it? Because the extension falls off the hose, and all the brushes fall off the extension! I'm usually in flip-flops when I vacuum and so many times I've been hit in the toe by falling parts! It also isn't that compact when it comes to storage. It takes up just as much space as any other vacuum cleaner, as far as I'm concerned.

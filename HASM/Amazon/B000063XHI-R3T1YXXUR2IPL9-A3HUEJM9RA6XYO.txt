Title: Disapointing!
Content:
For a very expesive coffee maker this is a severly dissapointing product.  About 20% of the time we use the pot (7-8 cups) it ends up backing up and overflowing, causing a huge mess of grounds and coffee.  It seems the flow rate intot he pot is faster than the flow out to the carafe, or perhaps the carafe develops an air-lock.  Whatever it is a disaster and a flawed device.  Besides the coffee tastes better in my 10 year old $50 Krups!

Title: Bigger Battery and a Better Warranty on the A1 Variant!
Content:
I recently ordered this notebook after seeing all the great reviews of it online. I was looking for a good thin and light laptop with reasonable performance that could also handle streaming HD video. The UL30VT seemed to hit the performance / price sweet spot perfectly. There are two variants currently available on Amazon - the UL30VT-X1 in black, and the UL30VT-A1 in silver. I picked this black one and hit the "Order" button. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards, I re-read the technical specs and realized that these two models are NOT the same!
First, the X1 ships with a 4400mAh battery, while the A1 whips with a newer 5600mAh battery. That's 27% more batter life, which if you believe the manufacturer amounts to 2-3 extra hours runtime. On top of that, the A1 has a 2 year warranty, compared to the 1 year warranty offered with the X1. The two laptops sell for the same price within a couple of dollars at the time of writing. The only other difference between the machines is that the A1 is silver rather than black. So, unless you absolutely hate the silver color, the choice is pretty much a no-brainer...
I was a little too late to cancel and change my order, so I'm intending to send it back for a 100% refund as soon as it arrives. Meanwhile I've ordered the A1... Hoping to save someone else the same hassle!

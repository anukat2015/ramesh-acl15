Title: Worst camera I've ever used!
Content:
I have been unhappy with this camera ever since the first week I've had it. The salesman was standing next to me the first night I used it at a church reception, when I was trying to make a photo for the newspaper. The salesman (Joe) was also using a Minolta Maxx 7D. The shutter stuck and wouldn't budge. He told me to take out the card and put it in his camera. Then I made the shot I needed with HIS camera and took the new one home. Never could figure out why the shutter stuck that night. Then I took the camera to Charleston last weekend for a conference. Several shots were ruined due to the shutter sticking and refusing to go down. Twice I managed to force the shutter down and two pictures were so blurred the people are unrecognizable. I tried to change the lens on it by placing a Minolta telephoto zoom lens on, one from my Minolta system 9 35 mm. Got the message in the window, "No lens attached." It was perfectly attached and in place! Then I tried to use the larger flash that came with the 35 mm on the shoe. Flash would not work. Many, many shots were lost due to poor timing by this camera. The salesman refuses to give me my money back. I will have to sell it for whatever KEH in Atlanta offers and it is not much. I paid $1,400 for this plus tax out of my social security check. I feel robbed. I am a former Nikon user and never again will I get a Minolta.

Title: looks and works beautifully
Content:
Has smell the first use but no Oder thereafter. We use this heater in our bedroom, so we don't have to heat up the entire house to have a warm bedroom. We also bought another one for our family room. The Winters are very cold where we live. These heaters pay for themselves in comfort and savings for use as area heat.

Title: Looks can be deceiving
Content:
Wow!  Too good to be true would be a correct summation here.  It is flimsy and coffee doesn't stay hot.  You get what you pay for.  But if you are looking for an impressive looking machine for the price - go for it.  Sorry, Westbend, but go back to the drawing board. Do more than make it pretty.

Title: Thermo does not work well
Content:
A compact body, but very effective.  The only deficit is that thermo switch does not effect well and a room is heated too much.  this is a bit of problem when you leave the switch on while you are sleeping.  I often woke up at night because the room was too hot and I swet all over.

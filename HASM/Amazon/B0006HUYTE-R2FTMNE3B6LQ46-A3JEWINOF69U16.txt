Title: Eureka Sanitaire
Content:
This canister vac is very powerful, and the canister is easy to carry. The attachment hose is pretty long, and the straight tube attachment is very nice, metal. It has the usual nozzle assortment, the main one (shown) has retractable hard bristles.  One downside is the unit gets hot pretty quickly. Also, it is louder than I expected from the description. But I am very satisfied with its performance and glad I bought it, it works better than some much more expensive models I've tried.

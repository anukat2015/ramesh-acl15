Title: Buy if your looking for a headache.
Content:
Actually I would really give it less than 1 Star.
In my experience, with this computer you will need to replace the battery after 6 months or less even with LIGHT use (at the cost of $175 through Dell). Secondly, your 'Laptop' will end up becoming a 'Desktop' because the screen will quit working and you will have to borrow your screen from your desktop (unless you want to pay the $200+ to repair or replace the screen).  Thirdly, you will find out that your Desktop screen will not keep a signal  because there are no screw-in options on the side where the connection for the extra screen is.  All of this will then
leave you with the the following options: a)replace the screen b)repair the screen if it is possible to repair or c)buy the replacement part that has the screws on it so your desktop screen will keep a signal. 
And if that isn't enough to turn you off, no worries, because it gets worse...  
After all of the above, out of the clear blue sky, your hard drive will take a dive & then all you will be left with is deciding which day to take it out to the trash.
To give you an idea of how common my story is with this brand, here's some searches you can Google: 
1) Dell Inspiron+screen black 
2) Dell Inspiron+screen won't come 
3) Dell Inspiron+battery not charging
4) Dell Inspiron+won't boot up
Bottom Line: Unless you are looking for a way to give yourself a migraine, I would highly recommend that you steer clear of this brand altogether.

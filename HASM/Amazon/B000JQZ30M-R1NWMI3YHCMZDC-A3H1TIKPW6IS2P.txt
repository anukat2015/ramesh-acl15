Title: To-be-expected Space Heater
Content:
To start, I must say that my TRUE rating is for 3.5 stars...the heater is just not good enough for me to round up to 4.
This heater performs as expected.  We have the item in our master bedroom due to a redesign of the space, in which the heating vent was moved near the door which allows the heat to escape to the return vents in the hall before it circulates the room.  We're in Atlanta, and the nights get pretty cold during the winter months.
The room is 12 x 16, and with the doors (to the hallway and master bath) closed, the room gets plenty cozy with the space heater on high.  On low (which is just a lower heat setting with the same fan speed), it gets there, but just not as quickly.  However, with the doors open, the area immediately in front of the heater gets warm, but the rest of the room barely feels like its even on.  In short, if you're using this to keep a medium sized, closed area warm (just about any bedroom) then this space heater will definitely get the job done and is worth every penny.  But if your 'space' is a small part of a large space, don't expect it to even keep the 'area' warm.  We need a space heater for a finished basement sitting area, and don't plan on purchasing this one again.
Here are my pros, cons, and comments on items other people have mentioned:
PROS
- Design does fit into typical room decor.  Doesn't stand out like typical space heaters do.
- Oscillation is a nice feature.  Its true that it doesn't turn much, but it turns enough to cover a good area.
- Timer is a great feature.  All space heaters should be equipped with this.
- The unit itself does not get warm, which is a plus.  Makes for easy handling, even immediately after use.
- Radiates good amount of heat for such a small unit.
CONS
- Thermostat doesn't seem to be sensitive or accurate.  Setting it to 65 degrees (with a digital thermometer in the room), the unit didn't shut off until ambient temp was 73 degrees, and turned back on at 68 degrees.
- Again, gets a medium-size, closed space warm, but anything more than that is asking too much of the unit.
- Unit needs to be on to maintain warmth for longer periods.
- Even though I don't expect it to keep a large area warm, I would expect it to keep a small portion of a large area warm based on its location.  However, it doesn't stand up to that test (Why?  I am not sure).  If the area is not closed off, you might as well try to keep warm by burning a candle next to you instead.
COMMENTS
- Some reviews complain about the power cord getting warm, and even hot to the touch.  We have run the unit for about 3 continuous hours, and after that, the cord is relatively warm, but not alarmingly warm.  I can't attest to how warm it would be after 5+ hours of continuous use, but I don't consider that to be 'normal' use either.  If its a major concern, shut the unit off and unplug it for a few minutes here and there, or set the thermostat lower so it shuts off more frequently during extended use.
- The fan noise generated is really white background noise.  My fiance is a light sleeper, and it doesn't seem to bother her at all.  Its no noisier than the heat coming from our vents.  Not sure why some reviewers have an issue with this.

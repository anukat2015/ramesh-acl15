Title: Not bad.
Content:
The first Zune I got messed up after a few days...but amazon sent me a new one.
The large screen looks great, but it sucks the battery like no one's business. The syncing is SO slow for video. On the upside, it takes wmv's, do you don't have to pay a ton for an obscure converter for some crazy file-type. 
So, here's the breakdown:
Pros:
Radio tuner (!!)
Nice settings - you can set a picture as your background. Also, it has country settings for the Radio Tuner, so it can work in other countries besides the USA.
Huge screen, GREAT picture
(For some of us, it's a pro that it is not an iPod)
Non-scratchable case
Feels very durable
Wifi is neat (but rarely useful.)
Cons:
Lower battery life (about 3-4hrs of video if wifi is off)
No wall charger included
Slow syncing for video
Software is a bit clunky (but so is apple's)
4/5 stars - It has some things I don't like, but overall, I'm happy with it. And, as much as I will be flamed for it, I just did not want anything apple-related. (Plus they were more expensive)

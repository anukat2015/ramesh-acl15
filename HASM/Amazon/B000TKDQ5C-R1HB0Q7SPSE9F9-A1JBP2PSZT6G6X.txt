Title: Nice Little Heater
Content:
I bought this small heater about a year ago when one of my bathroom overhead heat lamps went out.  Where I live in Texas the winters aren't terrible, but I welcome a little something to take the chill off when showering or dressing in the morning.  I turn it on in the morning, and by the time I go to get dressed, the bathroom is nice and warm.  I don't think it would heat a large space like a living room, it's just too small, but it's a perfect size for a bathroom or other smaller space.  I'm happy with it, and bought another one for the other bathroom because for me it's more effective than the overhead heat lamp.

Title: I love this product
Content:
As said on another review of this product it takes some getting used to the lid but once figured out it's a breeze (make sure it's firmly closed during the brewing process!). Coffee is the perfect temperature if you warm the pot before use, not too hot and never 'burnt'. I love the convenience of filling the reservoir and clean up is easy. Being the only coffee drinker in this house it's good to have a pot there keeping your favorite drink at the perfect temperature for quite a few hours without sacrificing the flavor and quality. Thumb's up from me, I would recommend this product.

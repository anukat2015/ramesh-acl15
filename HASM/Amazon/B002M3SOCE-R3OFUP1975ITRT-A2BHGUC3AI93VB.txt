Title: Multiple advantages of Apple iPod touch

The iPod touch has all the wonderful features of the original iPod nano but with increased memory and the ability to run apps, it increases the versatility of the product tremendously.  In particular, being able to use the iPod touch to run drug reference databases has been a tremendous asset.

Title: I HATE this vacuum cleaner
Content:
Where should I start with the awfulness of this vacuum cleaner?  The really small bags that you constantly have to replace, or the fact that this is THE MOST difficult vacuum cleaner to handle and maneuver.  It flips upside down on me several times while I'm trying to vacuum.  It gets stuck around corners.  I'm fighting with it constantly.  It doesn't steer well.  The wheels on the 2 main attachments limit its movement to just forward and back (no sideways).  I removed the wheels on the one for the hardwood floors.  The rug-beater attachment is pathetic - no power - and the wheels not only limit movement but also squish stuff into the hardwood floors which makes you do more work cleaning up!  I think they make the rug attachment able to be turned off and on so that you can vacuum other surfaces - but don't do it - I'm still trying to scrape kitty litter and other stuff off my floor!  The suction is pathetic.  I've resorted to using my dust pan and brush and my Shark hand vac because I dread lugging that thing around.  Don't buy it!

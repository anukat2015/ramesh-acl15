Title: Unhappy
Content:
I purchased this vac recently after using uprights.  I found handling this heavy canister extremely difficult to handle and move.  Dragging the cannister behind me while pulling the hose to move it around was clumsy and quite unpleasant. I'm sorry I spent all this money as I would have liked another upright after this one.
The seller was great and extremely fast to ship.  That's my positive on this one.  Hoover has been reliable for me and this is no exception. It does an excellent job in picking up on my hard wood flooring. My upright was even more excellent in getting close to walls. It's too cumbersome to send back to Amazon so I'm stuck.

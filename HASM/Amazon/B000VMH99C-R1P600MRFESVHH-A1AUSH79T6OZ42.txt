Title: Inspiron E1705 Laptop Best Suited as a Boat Anchor
Content:
I'm writing this review on a 10" ASUS netbook which is an awesome $400 unit that for five months has been literally without issues. Wish I could say that for the Dell unit. With that said, I've had the E1705 for less than two years and continue to have major problems. Right now I'm waiting for the Dell box to arrive so I can send it back for the second time in four months because it continues to crash. The first time, the blue screen of death; now the white screen of death.
I'm on my third video card and third keyboard. I've never really been able to run two photo editing programs consistently -- Nikon NX and Adobe Elements 6 without issues... (I do have 3 gig of RAM so running those programs shouldn't be an issue.) I've also covered up the touchpad with a piece of stickyback felt to keep the cursor from jumping to another line while I'm typing a Word document. 
This is my third Dell overall. Have never had these problems with a Dell before, but it will be my last Dell should it crash again after it's repaired and sent back. In fact, I may try an iMac.
Cheers... JD

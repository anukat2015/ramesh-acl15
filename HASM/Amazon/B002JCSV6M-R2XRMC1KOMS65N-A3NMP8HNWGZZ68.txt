Title: The D300s Delivers As Advertised
Content:
I've had my eye on the D300s for quite sometime now and after finally getting one, I can say without a doubt that this camera is quite simply spectacular. It has yet to disappoint me and I seriously doubt it will...ever.
My first day of testing was at a local horse track and it lived up to the billing in it's ability to capture the fast action on the track. I used a Sigma 70-200mm f2.8 for the majority of the day and I was very pleased with the results of the two. I see very little if any difference in terms of overall quality in the Sigma over the Nikkor. Matched with the D300s, it's a shooters dream.
The only setback I have encountered so far is user related in having to overcome the feeling of being overwhelmed by all of the features that the D300s provides. If you shot a lesser amateur model such as the D60, this is really a step up and you will be challenged in terms of shot composition and camera settings. There is no Auto mode or a dial for Sports or what have you. So, really it makes you become a better photographer because you have to learn how set the camera for the best results. I really like this aspect.
I could get into details, but there are many others here who do a better job of that so I will just say that I really like this camera very much and am proud to be an owner of another fantastic product from Nikon.

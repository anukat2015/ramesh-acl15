Title: The N50 is an Outstanding Entry-Level D-SLR
Content:
I have used Canon and Nikon film cameras for more than 20 years (love my N55 and still use an AE1-P) and own other Canon and Nikon digitals but this was my first D-SLR.  I scoured magazine and online reviews and the choice came down to the Canon EOS Rebel XT and the Nikon D70.
They are very similar.  The EOS is 8.0 MP vs. the D70's 6.1 MP but for the type of photography I will be doing (max 11x14 prints) that is not a problem.  The D70 has quite a few more control features.  That and the price difference tipped me towards the Nikon.
Once I made up my mind to buy a Nikon, I compared the D70 to the D50.  They are quite similar and in some ways the D50 is superior to the more expensive D70.  Besides a more rugged body, the D70 has a few nice features the D50 lacks: a lighted control panel, a front sub-control thumbwheel, depth of field preview, and you can fine-tune white balance.  But the D50 has some features over the D70, notable a larger LCD monitor, higher capacity battery, and USB 2.0 high speed support.  Every magazine I read raved about the D50 and none of the features it lacked made me willing to pay more for the D70.  I purchased the D50 with the Nikkor AF-S DX 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G Zoom Lens.
After using it for several weeks all I can say is, wow!  It is easy to use but I can fiddle with nearly all settings when I want to get creative.  Using a digital with almost no shutter lag has spoiled me.  I've taken many great shots with a Canon PowerShot 1S IS but it's my backup now.  In the D50 I have finally found an affordable digital camera that is as fun to use as my film cameras.
Pros will probably prefer higher-end Nikons but if you like using film SLRs and would like to get into a D-SLR for less than the price of a decent used car, I highly recommend the D50.
June 2006 update: I recently used my D-50 to photograph friends doing a triathlon to raise money for cancer research.  It performed flawlessly in all settings and I ended up with many outstanding photos.  The triathlon gave me ample opportunities to use the D-50's "sports" setting and continuous exposure feature to capture athletes swimming, bicycling, and running from a variety of distances.  The colors are perfect and I was able to get 5x7 and 8x10 prints on photo paper (from a lab) with hardly a tweak beyond cropping.  The D-50 is now my favorite camera.  Yes, there are cameras with higher resolution and more features but it is hard to beat the "bang for the buck" factor on the D-50.
One suggestion: like every other camera manual I have ever read, the Nikon manual that comes with the D-50 is accurate and complete but leaves a lot to be desired.  Unless you are so experienced that you do not have to read a manual (and I'm not) I highly recommend you invest in a copy "Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon D50" by Simon Stafford.  This book is everything the Nikon manual is not.  This Magic Lantern Guide not only thoroughly explains every feature on the D-50 but goes beyond to illustrate how, when, and why you would use a setting or feature.  It also throws in tips & tricks that Nikon's writers wouldn't include.  Highly recommended.

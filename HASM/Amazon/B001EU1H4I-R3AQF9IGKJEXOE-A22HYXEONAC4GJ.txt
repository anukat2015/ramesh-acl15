Title: installation a nightmare!!
Content:
The installation of this coffeemaker was a nightmare!!  The mounting plate does not come off as indicated in the directions.  The mounting template was incorrect for allowing for a cabinet overhang, the extended marking line should have been opposite of what was shown.  
I will say, once I got the darn thing in it is a good coffeemaker, makes great coffee and the design looks nice.
Black & Decker, work on your installation directions.  I'm sure you're paying someone good money to prepare these.

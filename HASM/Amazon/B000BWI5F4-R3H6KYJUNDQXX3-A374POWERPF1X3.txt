Title: Disappointing
Content:
I have had this vacuum for about a year.
Pros:
- Cleans my wood floors (but nothing out of the ordinary).
- Light, easy to carry.
Cons:
- The canister regularly tips onto its rump, preventing movement. (Looks like it is "sitting up" like a dog).
- Useless attachments. I really need a round brush attachment.
- The cord has never retracted the way I am used to. Any time I want to retract the cord, I have to pull it all the way out first and then let it reel itself back in. It is a real pain.
- Expensive as all get out.
Update: I would really like to find a round brush attachment for dusting, but I can't seem to find any accessories for this vacuum.

Title: Excellent Computer Until Something Goes Wrong
Content:
I purchased my Sony VIAO VGN-AW120J ten months ago.  It most aspects it is a wonderful computer.  Previously the only problem I had was that the unit locked up, but as the one reviewer stated all you have to do is unplug the unit and then remove the battery.  Wait a minute and then reinstall the battery and plug it in.  Then all worked well.
But last week my optical drive went out.  I purchased the unit in Denver but I am now in Europe.  Sony wanted me to send the unit back to the States for repair under warranty.  The cost of shipping was prohibitive.  I called Sony Europe, but because I purchased it in the States the warranty was invalid and I would have to pay shipping and repair -$881.  A HUGE cost.  My only suggestion if you purchase this unit and plan to be overseas is to take out the international warranty (I was not told that this was available, but it is - so ask)

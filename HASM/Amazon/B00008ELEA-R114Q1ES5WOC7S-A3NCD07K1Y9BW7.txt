Title: Farberware 8-cup percolator
Content:
I bought a 4 cup, same brand, and just loved it.  I then bought another
one for my best friends.  
They asked me to locate the 8 cup.  The price at Amazon was 50% cheaper
than I could find anywhere else.  The prices were as much as $79.99. 
It makes great coffee and is easy to clean.  I put in some vinegar and
a drop of mild dishsoap, and turn it on.
I will buy more for gifts

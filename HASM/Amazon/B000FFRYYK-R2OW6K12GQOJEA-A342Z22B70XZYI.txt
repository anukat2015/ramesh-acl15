Title: They'll send you a new carafe
Content:
I love this coffeemaker, but the carafe didn't just drip - it poured coffee down the front and onto the counter every time I poured a cup.  I had to keep a towel on the counter to soak up the mess.
I called Bunn Customer Service and they gave me the story about cleaning it properly.  I assured them that no amount of cleaning kept it from leaking.  I was then informed that the carafe, or maybe the lid, had been "re-tooled" and that they would send me a new one.  It took several weeks (they said it was backordered) but it finally came, and I have had absolutely no problems with it.  The lid seems to fit much tighter than the original, but not a single drop goes where it's not meant to.
They also sent me a shipping label to use to send the old carafe back at no cost.

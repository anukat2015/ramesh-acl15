Title: PC to MAC
Content:
What can I say but Outstanding!! I have been a PC user for over 20 years and this was my venture inot the MAC world... Its been 3 weeks and so far I have truly enjoyed the journey... I still find myself double-clicking on objects, but the tranisition has been smooth... I still have my PC and do not plan to get rid of it (Security Blanket) because I still find some things easier to do on my PC because its my baseline...:-)
Things that I like about the MACBOOK Pro:
1. Intutive nature of the program
2. Drag and drop function
3. Plug and Play
4. Tutorials
5. Lightweight
Things I do not like about the MACBOOk Pro
1. Lack of Variety of Software
Overall, An outstandig product and I highly recommend...

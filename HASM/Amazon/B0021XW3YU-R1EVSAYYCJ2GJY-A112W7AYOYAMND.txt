Title: Great zoom, ok night time quality
Content:
This camera seemed like the perfect thing on the market. It was nicely priced and offered great features. It arrived in good time and great condition. The zoom is fantastic but unless you have a VERY steady had, the pictures will be blurry. As far as i see it, the only way its max zoom will work well is if you have a camera stand/tripod. Holding it in your hand whilst zooming doesnt give a good quality picture at all... The night time quality is also quite bad.. even after using alternative settings on the camera, it still isn't the best I have seen. It works terribly in false lighting such as florescent etc, but I suppose the same will apply for most cameras

Title: Try it
Content:
I read several negative reviews for this product and almost didnt get it.  I read a coupld positive reviews and decided to take a chance.  Apparently some reviewers had problems with the machine leaking onto the floor.  I havent had any problems at all.  Also, the grinder is just a little louder than a stand alone grinder, nothing to worry about.  I would suggest getting a factory refurbished model because its less than half the cost.

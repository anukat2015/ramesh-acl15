Title: Worth replacing the old Tassimo
Content:
Thanks to all the reviewers who replaced their old Tassimo with the new one.  I wouldn't have considered buying the new machine otherwise.  I'm so glad to have the new Bosch machine!!!  Wow - everything is great and they paid attention to the annoyances of the old machine.  On/Off switch now in the front; press the brew button as soon as coffee is in machine and don't have to wait and wait for green light to come on; different cup sizes fit easily; and oh so quiet.
Would like the machine in ALL BLACK with the filter system.

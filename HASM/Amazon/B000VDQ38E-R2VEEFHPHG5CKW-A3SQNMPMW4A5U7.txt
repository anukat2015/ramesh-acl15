Title: Very good product.
Content:
So far it works great! My only complaint would be the long, stretchy hose pulls the vacuum over when cleaning stairs but otherwise there are no complaints with suction or anything else.  Carpets smell cleaner to me and the clear hoses and dirt cup make you want to vacuum way more often. Yuck! There's so much dirt AHHH! [Goes into Psycho Vacuuming Mode] 
Overall, I am very happy with my purchase :) I'm allergic to my cat so the HEPA filter makes me breathe a little easier.

Title: Heats really good (if you like quadrupling your electric bill)
Content:
My mother-in-law bought this heater for $400, as a supplement to her two moniter heaters (thinking it would save her on oil bills). Her electric bill (after living in same home for 33 years) went from 60+$ per month to $280+ $ per month!!!!!!!!!! The first month. Strange but true.WOOD HEAT MUCH CHEAPER

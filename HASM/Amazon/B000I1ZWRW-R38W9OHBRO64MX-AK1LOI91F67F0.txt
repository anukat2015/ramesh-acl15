Content:
What a difference.  I haven't had much time to learn the ins and outs of it but its easy to pick up and use, even if you've never touched it before.  I have an older Sigma telephoto/super macro that throws an error code when used outside with this camera.  Canon customer support is awesome though and directed me on how to remedy the problem.  They are courteous and professional.  The customer service alone is enough to keep me with Canon.  The flash mechanism rattles a little bit and makes you think somethings broken when you pull it out of the box but if you read the manual you'll find thats normal. LCD screen is awesome.  Functions are pretty easy to navigate, especially if you have experience with any of Canon's PowerShots.  Looking forward to many years with this camera and the shots it will capture.

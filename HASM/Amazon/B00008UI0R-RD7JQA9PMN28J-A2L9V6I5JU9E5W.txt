Title: does all that it should
Content:
The product does a good job of claning, especially of my uneven tile floors in the kitchen & dining room with the appropriate brush attachment, which is the first one like this that I've found. Product is also lightweight which is really helpful doing more than 1 story & stairs.
I'd like it if the collector were larger & held more. but, then the unit would probably be larger & heavier, making it more difficult to carry. Also, the hose could be longer, but would add to weight. Overall, i'm very satisfied with it.

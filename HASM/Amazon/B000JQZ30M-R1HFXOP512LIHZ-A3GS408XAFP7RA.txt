Title: Too Cute and It WORKS!
Content:
I can't say enough about this heater. I like my bathroom to be cozy warm when I climb out of the shower. Bathroom heaters are pretty much hideous for the most part so I was beside myself when I saw this one. This thing looks awesome and heats better than any small heater I've ever had in my bathroom. 
I have only used it in a small space. I do not believe it is intended for anything other than a small space. 
We bought a larger Lasko heater for a game room a couple of years ago and found it to be excellent. That is what prompted me to search out Lasko when I wanted a new bathroom heater. It has a good variety of setting options and does not take up too much space.
I am always pleased when I find what I want on Amazon and at a good price. I purchase without worrying about getting ripped off.
Go for it!

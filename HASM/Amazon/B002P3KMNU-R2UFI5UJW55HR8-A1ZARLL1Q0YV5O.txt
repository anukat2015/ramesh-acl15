Title: Good and Bad, happy camper.
Content:
ok I've had this laptop for about... 3-4  months now and I have my personal thoughts about it (I'll make it as short and to the point as possible).
Pros:
-biggest wow is the battery life, I'm on campus ALL day without a recharge. I love how I can find a seat ANYWHERE and be good while others are going around like headless chickens clucking around for an outlet 
-When closed, it's light and feels snug and sexy carrying it around. Aesthetically beautiful. sometimes i want people to notice my laptop cus it just looks like ooh la la
-oh my gosh, the screen is bright enough to use outdoors at noon on a summer day. i usually keep it at 50%-60% to save battery and save my eyes.
-speakers are pretty wow (laptop has to be on hard surface for max potential) speakers are under palmrest
-webcam + mic
- 500gb HD
-LED screen, not LCD
Cons:
-(most annoying for me) palm rest creeks and squeaks when typing, it's not loud but annoying nontheless
- no bluetooth
-HD divided into 2 seperate HD's, wish it was one
-HD 5400rpm, wished to be 7200rpm
wished it had:
-more usb's maybe 1 more in the back... 3 seems eh but it is a laptop so maybe i'm being picky
-bluetooth (for obvious reasons)
-lit keyboard
-speakers relocated, on a table, speakers sounds clear (nice), however, on my lap, it just doesnt cut it, muffled.
overall:
happy.
for $699+tax you can go a lot worse
my opinion, u get a lot for your $
companies like hp and dell selling less optimal laptops for same to higher price
if i was rich, i would go with a macbook pro, but i'm not.
i can see myself using this laptop for the next 10 years no problem

Title: Excellent FX Digital Pro SLR Camera
Content:
I have been a Nikon user for long time and I've always liked the picture quality, ease of use, and the ergonomics of Nikon cameras compared to other camera brands.  I have done an extensive research on full frame (FX) digital SLR cameras and the D700 is by far the best FX digital SLR camera on the market.  The picture quality is awesome and it's performance at high ISO is superb.  Be sure to use pro-grade lens and fast CF card (e.g., Sandisk Extreme UDMA) to get the best out of this camera.  
Here are my setup:
Nikon D700 with MB-D10 Battery Grip with EN-EL4a battery
Nikkor 24-70mm f2.8
Nikkor 80-200mm f2.8
Nikkor 50mm f1.4
Nikkon SB-800

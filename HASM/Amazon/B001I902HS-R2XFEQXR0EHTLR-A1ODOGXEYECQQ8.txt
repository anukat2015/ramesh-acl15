Title: Solidly Made Canister with the New OptiFlow Technology
Content:
The main difference with this canister type vacuum from the conventional ones is its new Opti-flow technology.  It has a double wall bag chamber to allow airflow not only inside but also around the exterior of the bag. Usually when the bag is getting full, the airflow becomes restricted.  This idea tries to work around that problem to create a more consistent suction even the bag fills up.  
Assembly is a cinch.  It is easy to tug along as the wheels turn in all directions plus the hose adapter rotates a complete 360 degrees as you maneuver it.  Nicely equipped with HEPA filter.  I love the automatic cord reel for easier storage.  It is not too strong to strike you like a whip if you let go of it.  But just enough control to make it reel back (cord is 26-foot long). The rubber bumper is a must to protect your walls and furniture.  It includes 2 attachments, a brush and a crevice tool that are neatly tuck inside the canister.  
Of all 4 vacs we have in the house, it is so far the quietest.  The easy access on/floor/carpet switch by the handle is very convenient.  There is an overload protector to guard against belt breakage if the agitator become jammed.  Likewise, there is a red dot indicator if the bag is full or somehow the airway gets clogged.
Considering the size of the canister, the Panasonic AMC-J3EP Canister Replacement Bag(type C-18)(4/U) for MC-CG885 is a bit small.  But it is one of the best vacuum bags I have seen, well constructed and superior quality.  It is enclosed in an easy remove basket which makes changing the bag quick and easy.

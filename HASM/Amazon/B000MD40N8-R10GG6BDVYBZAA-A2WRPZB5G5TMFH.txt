Title: Great mp3 Player, and customer service

Sandisk Sansa Express 1 GB MP3 Player
Ok, I bought this mp3 player back in April of this year (2007) and it worked great until the begining of September when all of the sudden it would not start up, I contacted SanDisk tech support and they were very helpful, they asked that I send it to them (postage paid by them) and they sent me a brand new one. So far it has been working great. 
PROS: 1: it is easy to access the song you want 2: it lookes great and has a great lcd screen. 3: it's got a slot for a microsd card so that you can upgrade the memory up to 3 gb. 4: it it easy to recharge as long as you can access a computer 5: the sound quality is wonderful. 6: You can plug it in directly to your computer via USB, no extra cord needed
CONS: not that many!.1: The top surface scratches easily and is VERY fingerprint prone. I recommend that you get a cover/skin to go with it. 2: I don't think the firmware that comes with it is that good so you should go to the website and download the firmware updater to get the latest version of firmware.
If you are looking for a high quality, small, sleek, low cost mp3 player with great customer service and do not need to play video or look at photos this is the one for you.

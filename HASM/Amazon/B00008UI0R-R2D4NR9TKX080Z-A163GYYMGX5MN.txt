Title: Vroom Vroom
Content:
I live in an apartment with carpet everywhere. The wind tunnel comes to my rescue. Although the surface is small, the bucket gets full after every use. I like the fact that there are no bags to dispense and replace. After several use, I take out the bucket and the filter and clean them with water; it is that simple. There are three different speeds to choose from and the carpet option. Once I am done, I dismantle the pieces and place it in my closet where the lack of space is the norm. Highly recommended.

Title: A Green Thermostat That Tells a Story
Content:
I selected this thermostat as a replacement for my original that came with the house and had only two functions, on and off, both selections being manual. After vigorously accomplishing research and comparing features, I compared two brands, Honeywell and Hunter. Realizing my defunct thermostat was a Honeywell, I opted for the Hunter for several other reasons, such as cost, and return on investment. This thermostat is programmable, and will pay for itself in a matter of several electrical billing cycles for the summer with air conditioning in demand, or a winter season. 
It was so darn easy to install, that if you are capable of screwing in two screws and connecting your thermostat wires that are color coded, you can not go wrong. It may be a good idea to see which wires are connected to your old thermostat first and then write the information down on a piece of paper so you can re-wire the new thermostat using the color coding of the old thermostat to avoid any issues. I merely attached the back plate, connected the wires and inserted two AA batteries and was going in less than ten minutes. It was easier to program than Tivo and comes pre-programmed with an energy savings plan. These settings can be kept or customized freely.
This green thermostat tells a story. How long the AC or heat has been on throughout the day, the past days of the week, or the entire week and can be programmed daily which really worked for me. I wished all thermostats came with the amount of features that this one did, as it would have made my selection much more difficult.

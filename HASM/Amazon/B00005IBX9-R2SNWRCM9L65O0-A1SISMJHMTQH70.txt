Title: Excellent Coffee Maker!
Content:
This is a very attractive coffee maker, which is what originally drew me to it. Of course, the Cuisinart name was a plus as well. After using it for a month or so, I must say that I'm pleased, having gotten a near-perfect cup of coffee every time. The carafe pours smoothly (a feature missing on some Mr. Coffee models I've used in the past). The controls are easy to use and durable (not to mention very 'retro'). Parts are also removable for easy cleaning.Having praised a worthy coffee maker, I must point out one minor negative. It is impossible to see the water-level indicator inside the water reservior (unless you're eight feet tall and use a flashlight). This is annoying for folks like me who like to cheat and not measure the water in the carafe. Waiting for it to settle on the counter to get an accurate measure takes too long when you're caffeine deprived...set it up the night before, you say? Yeah, right...who really does that! Bottom Line: This coffee maker is worth the price in both looks and function!

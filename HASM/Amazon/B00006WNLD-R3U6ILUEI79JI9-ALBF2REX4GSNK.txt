Title: Dandy little machine!
Content:
I had purchased this a while back but not used it. Then I broke my arm and started using this coffeemaker because I couldn't light my stove to boil water as usual. It's very easy and makes a good cup of coffee. What more could you ask for? If it weren't for this easy little machine, I'd not only have a broken arm, I'd have a whopping caffeine headache :)

Title: Style and Performance
Content:
This laptop was purchased as a replacement computer for my 14 year-old daughter for school. Set up was a breeze. MS Office for Home and Student loaded easily and performs well. She's spent several weeks learning the pre-installed apps and is having a ball with the web cam, video editing and graphics programs. Of course, she loves the way it looks and never misses an opportunity to show her friends her "funky, retro" computer.
Vista has been fine. The 64-bit version of IE 8.0 hasn't worked well since we performed the suggested install but that's a Microsoft issue, not HP. Standard IE 8.0 and Firefox run great.
A solid laptop for a reasonable price. All in all a great purchase.

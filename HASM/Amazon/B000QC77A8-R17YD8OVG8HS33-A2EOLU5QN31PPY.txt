Title: Yet another product that fails to live up to expectations
Content:
This is an attractive heater and, in theory, could be a good one.  It does have going for it helpful digital controls and t-stat, and a strong, consistent flow of sufficiently warm air. Sadly, the pros here are utterly negated by the cons, which are at best annoying, at worst, toxic and hazardous:  1. Every time it is run, the heated air being generated has a noxious smell, reminiscent of over-heated plastic (and no, this isn't just the 'out-of-the-box' burning off phase) - plastics are one of our stealthiest carcinogens, and when heated.. well, let's just say "not ideal."  2. The cord gets so hot it scared even my fearless spouse, who rock-climbs and eats full-fat cheese.  The cord only overheats when the unit is on high - but what good is having the thing if we can only run it on low?  I fail to grasp what is so difficult about producing a decent space heater, and wish Lasko and other manufacturers would wake up and smell the consumer dissatisfaction.  Perhaps they can't smell it over the odor of burning plastic...

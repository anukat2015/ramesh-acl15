Title: Great vacuum! Works just fine!
Content:
Very powerful for its size. I bet previous reviewers confused Roadster Bagless Canister machine with its smaller relative which is not bagless. Like I said it's powerful, lightweight. It does not require to change filters like previous reviewer said. It's good on picking up dirt off carpets and hard floors. Works like charm for 2 months straight and our family loves this little devil. :)

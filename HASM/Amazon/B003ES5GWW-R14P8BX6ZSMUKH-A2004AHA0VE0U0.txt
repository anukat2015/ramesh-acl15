Title: One word: Beautiful!
Content:
This is by far the most perfect gadget I have owned to date.. I am what you call a technology freak/geek. I buy pretty much any new "gadget" I can get my hands on, so I would like to think that I know a thing or two about what makes them good or bad. 
Anyways, I have owned a 30gb Ipod, a zune 30, 8, and 80, and the most recent; the iTouch. None of them can come close the quality and perfection of the Zune HD. The device itself is just drop dead gorgeous and well put together. It's thin, light, fast, and simple. The UI is  screaming fast and flawless, it beats the iTouch by a landslide. Whenever you touch something on the screen there is a awesome animation that goes along with it. The HD radio is a huge plus and works really good. 
My favorite feature is when you are playing a song (mostly from more popular artists) it shows their bio info behind the album art, looks very cool.(note: wi-fi has to be on)
Last but not least, to go along with the amazing device, the zune software has been updated and in my opinion is the most well designed, and beautiful piece of media software ever. 
If you are debating between the itouch and the Zune HD, I would no doubt go with the Zune.... Take if form someone that owns both.

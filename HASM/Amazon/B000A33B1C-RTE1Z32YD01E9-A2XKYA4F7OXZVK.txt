Title: GREAT HEAT ...GREAT PRICE
Content:
This is not my first Delonghi Oil Filled heater purchase. I am now the proud owner of 2.  The TRD0715T is another keeper.  Not as fancy as the DR-18T model but still does the job.  We keep the setting on low wattage and very low heat. It's not that cold here yet (35-52degrees outside) but we don't want the furnace running yet.  The 17x15 room is at 72degrees all evening long.  The heater does take time to heat up and I recommend starting on the high settings.  Once your ideal temperature is reached, cut it back, sit back and enjoy the warmth with out the high expense. The thermostat in the heater is off only by a few degress keeping the temperature consistant.
Last winter we supplemented with one heater.  The differance in the electric bill was minimal. It's nice to be warm when everyone else is wrapped in blankets.

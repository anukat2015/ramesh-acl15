Title: It's an ok device - not great.
Content:
I've had my iPod nano - 4GB for nearly a year. It was a Christmas gift. It's a nice little device. I have about 3.2GB of music stored on it and I use it nearly daily at work. I plug it up to my XP box at work and listen to my music all day while I work. My experience with this device has not been with out incident. I have had to restore it twice due to lock-up issues. It has lost all or part of the content on 3 separate occasions. I don't ever want to hear some MAC head tell me how good Apple products are. I've had XP running on my PC since it was originally introduced. I've had the iPOD for only 11 months. I've actually had more trouble with the iPOD in 11 months than I've had with my PC in 6 years (which included a system upgrade). You have to have iTunes to use the iPOD. You have to "Authorize" your PC before you can play any purchased music from the iTunes store. You can't transfer the music to the iPod until the PC is Authorized either. It's a simple step, true, but still annoying. But you are not limited to having to purchase music from iTunes. I download MP3s from Amazon. iTunes pick those up immediately and there is no need to "Authorize". Same goes for ripped CDs. My massive MP3/WMA library was also imported to iTUnes upon installation. The WMA files were converted to M4A format and stored separately for iTunes. So needles to say, I have music tracks now existing as WMA and M4A. M4A is MPEG4 and is not recognized by Windows Media Player, yet. iTunes does not come with the iPod, you must go to Apple.com, register the iPod, then download iTunes.The only things that come with the iPod are the earbuds, the USB cable and a little instruction sheet that directs you to Apple.com.

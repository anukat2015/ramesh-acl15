Title: This computer still has issues
Content:
After having the Sony vaio VGN-CS215J for seven months, I realize that Sony still have issues in perfecting these lap tops. My computer snores because the fan is noisy(a note was posted on their website to bring in 2 models for this problem) and the screen flickers at the bottom. What is this? hardware issues? It looks hard on the outside but I think this computer is too delicate for me. Not impress at all. I have to change it. The keyboard is nice.

Title: PROACTIVE SLR CAMERA
Content:
The Evolt E500 took a little to get used to but is easy to use, light weight and very user friendly. i can recommend this camera as a very good entry level SLR camera and the bonus is the telephoto lens. Light weight enough to pack as hand baggage and not at all as bulky as I thought it would be. Very happy with this unit.

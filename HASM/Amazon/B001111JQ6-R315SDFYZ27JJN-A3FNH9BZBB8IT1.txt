Title: Thermal is the way to go
Content:
I've had this coffeemaker for eighteen months now. It keeps coffee hot for more than two hours without the bitterness associated with coffee left on a hot plate. It pours coffee slower than out of a glass carafe and the last 2 ounces or so do not come out easily so I simply plan accordingly.  I know exactly how much water to put in the carafe for my morning fix of two large cups.  It is fast, fairly quiet, and does not emit steam from the top like my old coffeemaker did [ruining the wood cabinet over head]. Most of all, it makes good coffee and is dependable. This is a good product.

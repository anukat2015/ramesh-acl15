Title: Good stove, but manufacturer sells it for 20 bucks less!
Content:
This is a great little stove - if you happen to have any closed up fireplaces in your place, it looks wonderful on the hearth. Even without this, it is so much more attractive than a space heater - it does quite a good rendition of a wood stove, although it might bother some purists. I'd give the fire effect about a 75 percent for realism. Mine was dropped during delivery and a leg broke off - it was probably dropped pretty hard and they don't make thing the way the used to. That said, there is much to like about it. It's pretty quiet. The fan will circulate the air in the room, the "fire" looks pretty good for a fake one, plus the stove is cool to the touch - the hot air blows out from the bottom front of the stove. I'm so impressed with it, I'm thinking of buying a few wooden mantels and a few more of this stove to dress up and warm up a few more rooms. It adds such a cozy feeling to a room. One caveat - though amazon is usually a good deal, the manufacturer, [...] sells it for twenty bucks cheaper. Wish I had done my homework before buying it.

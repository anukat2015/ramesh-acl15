Title: Poor for Podcasts and Books on Pod
Content:
I used to have the more expensive Nano, but moved to a shuffle, because after replacing 2 Nanos I decided the price tag was too high for something I would need to replace every year or two.  At one point in time iTunes would autosync my Podcasts and Books on Pod.  At this point when I try to sync my free podcasts I get the message: "iTunes cannot add any songs to the iPod ... because no songs in the playlist My Podcasts can be copied to this iPod".  As far as Books on Pod go, I have to manually re-find the place in the book 80% of the time because the shuffle does not remember where things last were left off.  These are things I wouldn't expect from a name brand product.  So far the Shuffle gets a "D" grade for useability.  (I would give it an "E", but at least I have not had to replace it yet...)

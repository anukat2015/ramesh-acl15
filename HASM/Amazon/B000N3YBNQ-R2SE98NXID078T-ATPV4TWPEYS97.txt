Title: Excellent Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
I have owned several vacuum cleaners and I must say that this is the best one that I have ever used. It is small, smartly designed and extremely powerful. Some have complained about the small size of the bag, but I did not have that same problem cleaning my tile floors. I do agree with those who say that the cord is kind of short; it does get to be a bit of a pain having to plug and unplug it over and over. I also found that the cord tends to get in the way of the vacuum cleaner, but I quickly remedied that problem by simply holding the cord with the same hand that I used to hold the handle. Gripping the cord along with the handle keeps the cord up and out of the way.
I have two cats who shed like, well, they shed like cats....but this vacuum is so powerful that it visibly sucked the cat hairs toward it and I give it an excellent recommendation.

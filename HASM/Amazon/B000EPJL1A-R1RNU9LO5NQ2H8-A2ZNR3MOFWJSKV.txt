Title: Never be without your music ...
Content:
Cost effective:
At less than 80 dollars this is a great beginner IPOD for anyone, or just as a go everywhere device that you necessarily wouldn't be devistated if it somehow got broken or lost. Even for a child or older person with no computer, you can fill this with music and give it as a gift and occasionally change the music for them. Think, No moving parts, very rugged....so the price is great for what you get.
Operation:
You download the latest version of Itunes... then start loading this thing up with up 240 songs (depending on the size). Their is a light learning curve with Itunes but you'll get the hang of it very fast. The device has a rechargable battery inside it and is recharged when connected to the docking cable (included) via the PC. The package is complete with good instructions, ear buds, and docking station. Because this IPOD has no screen, there is no need for a case... its metal and very solid and has a clip attached. The sound quality is superb, and the controls work as designed. You can switch the unit on and off, and there are multiple playmodes. For those who bought this version and not the colored one, metal cases are available with many color choices so the fashion conscious can color coordinate this with thier outfit or mood.
I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend this tiny little musical wonder to anyone who needs a little background music to thier everyday world.

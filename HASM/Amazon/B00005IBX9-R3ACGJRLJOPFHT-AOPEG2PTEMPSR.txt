Title: Cuisinart DCC-1200 Coffee pot
Content:
I am very happy with the Cuisinare DCC-1200 coffee pot.  It is easy to use and so far everything works great.  People have complained about the small area where you pour the water in.  If you have a hard time pouring the water in the small area you can use a small funnel and you can pour the water in faster without worry of spilling any.  I like hot coffee and this pot gives you plenty of options as to how warm you like your brew.  The medium setting is plenty hot without burning the coffee.  I received the coffee pot on time with no hassels.

Title: great upgrade from my 1st gen Nano
Content:
The Zen is a terrific upgrade from my 1st generation Nano.  Music was easy to transfer from my iTunes library.  (My music is mostly from my own CDs, but if you purchased most of your library from iTunes, this may be an problem for you due to DRM.) With 16GB, there was more than enough room for everything I have.  The software is easy to use and functional, and WMP works fine for managing files.  Video and sound quality on the Zen are excellent (better headphones should be your first accessory, which is true of every player on the market) and all features work as expected.  Using the menus, while not as elegant as on the iPod, is simple enough.  The SD slot (uses a separate option on the menu, which takes no time at all to get used to) means you're limited only by the number of cards you want to take along.  Great for a long flight, and every SD card I have, regardless of size or speed, has worked fine for audio and video in this player.  There are plenty of aftermarket accessories available, and the standard USB connection means I can charge it with my cell phone (Moto RAZR) chargers, which eliminates extra devices from my suitcase.

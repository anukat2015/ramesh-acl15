Title: Fantastic Desktop Replacement
Content:
I was tired of dedicating so much space to my desktop.  After extensive research, the Sony beat out the HP and Dell comparables. I have been using it now for six months and I can't imagine doing without it.  It's too big to travel with, but moving it from room to room is no problem at all now that we have a wireless network, including the printer.  The HDMI output makes it easy to connect to my flatscreen so that we can watch free programing on sites like Hulu, or so that we can use it as our Blueray player for real HD enjoyment.  This computer will not need to be replaced for many years to come.

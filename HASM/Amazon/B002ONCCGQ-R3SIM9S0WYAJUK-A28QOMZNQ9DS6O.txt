Title: Good Laptop, Good price, slightly low speaker volume
Content:
A great light, small, fast 64bit laptop, NOT a netbook.
LONG battery life (easily over 4 hours with a bright screen) which is key for me as a frequent flier. The only (!) complaint I would have is that the speakers do not provide enough volume and I use it a lot for watching video tutorials at home via YouTube, so I have to grab my earphones and use them every time I watch one.
The rest...?  A superb buy for the price, size and weight.  And yes, it does NOT have a CD/DVD drive inside (you may need to buy an external one) but I believe that using a CD is going to be less and less mandatory. I bought a neat and great looking silver plated Samsung LightScribe together with the Laptop for approx, 55 bucks if i remember right and used it the first day to load some software. Now it rests in my briefcase... one of these days it will be useful again, I believe... so you may want to buy one too.
BOTTOM LINE: Love the Laptop, would like louder speakers, happy with my purchase and with Amazon's service.

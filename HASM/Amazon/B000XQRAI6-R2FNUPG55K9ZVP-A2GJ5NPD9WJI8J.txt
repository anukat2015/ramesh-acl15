SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Red)
Since this is my first mp3 player, I have nothing to compare it to.  So far I have one problem, and that is the unit won't hold a charge only for a short period. I read this complaint in the review section before I purchased it, but I figured the but buyer just got a defective unit. I was on song 12 and all of sudden, the player just cut off and message came up battery low. I don't know if this is a defect, or will I have to charge this player every other hour. I don't think so. Also, headphones are sort of bulky and a little large for my ears, but they can be replaced. Since the player really sound good, looks great, and have a bunch of neat feature, I'm going to return it and get another one and see how the replacement work.  Other than the charge not holding, it's really a nice little player with great sound.  Personally, if the battery life improves, I would definitely recommend keep it.

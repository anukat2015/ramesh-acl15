Title: Ipod Mini ordeal
Content:
I bought 2 ipods mini (one for me -blue- and one for my wife -green-)At 6 months the blue one completely died (apple sent me a new one without charge -great!)Six months later the battery died so I use the blue one as a hard disk or connected to a JBL device to play it.  My gentle wife gave me hers and a few weeks later I began having trouble with the battery again (nightmare). It says "out of power" even though I fully chraged it for hours. I found out that if i hit the device it would start again. As i do not care if i destroy this thing I will use it this way. I did not charge it 1000 times as Apple stated. I am getting a 4gb nano hoping that I will not live this again. If this happens again I will buy a radio and forget obout Apples ipod for good (cost to learn this lesson: US$700)

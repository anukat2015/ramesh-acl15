Title: Hoover S3765-040 bagless canister vacumm
Content:
It has been years since I used a canister vacumm. I remember them being so heavy and bulky. This vacuum has been a nice surprise. The suction is amazing, we have dogs and cats in our house so the hair is an issue. I thought my upright vacuum was doing a fair job of picking up the hair, was I wrong. When I empty the canister in this vacuum you can see the individual hair strands. The canister is small, I wish it was a little bit bigger. You have to empty it more often. The vacumm is light weight which is a plus as I have a tri-level house. The long wand that is attached to the carpet cleaner does seem to be cheaply made. A nice surprise was the attachment for vacuuming stairs. I almost bought the less expensivie model without the stair attachment, I am so glad I went with this one. It has its own belt so it continues to rotate and suck up the dirt. The canister and the filter is washable so you do not have to keep buying filters. If you keep the canister and the filter clean you will have no smell of old dirt and it will work like new. I would recommend this vacuum, I wish I had bought one sooner.

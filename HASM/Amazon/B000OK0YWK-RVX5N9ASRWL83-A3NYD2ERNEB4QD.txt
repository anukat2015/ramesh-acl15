Title: A good player
Content:
Let me start off with this is an awsome player... but the software is kinda a pain to get used to not as easy as my creative soft ware. This has been my 4th mp3 player the first being a sandisk who screen broke, then a creative zen vision which got stolen, creative zen v with also got stolen and now a zune. I have stayed away from ipods for a couple of reasons, 1. my razor phone has a tendancy to fall out of my pocket so having something with a little thickness keeps it in my pocket, also my friends have had countless problems with there ipods from screens to bad service. Probley on of the best players ive had was the creative zen vision m who's software was fast and simple and had a flawless operation, and i would have boughten another one but i cant find them anyware, so i went with the zune. The software takes a litte getting used to but once you figure it out its very simple. The player works perfectly videos look awsome, the music sounds good, the only thing i dont like is the ear phones as they start to hurt my ears after about 20 minutes of listening.

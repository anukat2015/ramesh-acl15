Title: The right tool for the job.
Content:
This vacuum cleaner is quiet, efficient, easy to carry around.
It sucks up coins even on it's lowest setting, so be careful to pick up first. 
It is made for hardwood floors, and it excells at cleaning them.
It is quiet enough, that even on it's highest setting, I can still hear the phone ring.
The built in cord is 17', which sounds like a long enough cord, but really isn't.
Fortunately our house, like most others, has plenty of outlets.
It is built in Germany, so you know it is a quality product made to last.

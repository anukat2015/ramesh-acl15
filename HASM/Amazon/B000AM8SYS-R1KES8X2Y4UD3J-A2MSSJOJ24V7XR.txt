Title: These heaters are LEGAL in Massachusetts!
Content:
These heaters absolutely ARE LEGAL in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. They were legalized several years ago when lawmakers finally realized that these are a non-issue. If these vent-free gas heaters need to remain outlawed because they are ventless, then so should gas stoves and ovens since those are also unvented.

Having said that, if you have "tight construction" with all areas sealed with GOOD weatherstripping, if you have a tight vapor barrier, and any gaps around plumbing and any dryer or appliance vents are caulked, then CO might become an issue. However, if you have a CO detector which is required by 527 CMR (in fact Taxachusetts mandates CO detectors in ALL homes now, being the nanny state it is) then you have PLENTY of notice for CO and will know you need to crack open a window.

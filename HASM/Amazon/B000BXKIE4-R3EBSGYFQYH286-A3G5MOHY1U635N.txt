Title: NICE VACUUM
Content:
EL7020A is the highest rated canister by Consumer Reports in 2006 - this is why I chose it.  I had this vacuum for almost a month now, and I really like its performance.  I like that the wand with the power brush fits under the bed where my upright did not fit.   I like that this vacuum has HEPA filtration and I do not sneeze when vacuuming anymore.  
The vacuum has powerful suction and nice features like "auto power-brush off when something gets stuck in it" and "auto suction reduction when something stops the airflow, so you can pull it out".  E.g., if a corner of a bathroom rug gets sucked in, the vacuum reduces suction power and you can pull the rug out, and the suction increases automatically. 
The bags are very small (mine filled up with carpet fibers after vacuuming the house 2 times).  I did not mind, all that means is that I don't keep all that dirt inside my vacuum in my home and throw it away more often.  Like one other user said, the "change bag" light did not come on when the bag filled up.  I found that the bag was full thanks to my curiosity.   I suspect that the "change bag" light performance depends on what the bag fills up with - if it fills up with carpet fibers, which still allow sufficient airflow, the light won't come on.
Another interesting thing I found was that the box says "Model EL7020A", but the bottom of the canister has a sticker that says "Model 7001".  I contacted Electrolux about the discrepancy, and, according to their Customer Service Rep, the model EL7020A is a combination of the 7001 canister and a power carpet brush (plus a bunch of other add-on tools).

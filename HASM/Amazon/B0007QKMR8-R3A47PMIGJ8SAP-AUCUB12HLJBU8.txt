Title: love it, with 1 exception
Content:
I was new to 35mm cameras when I purchased this camera.  Within a couple of hours, I felt in command of most of the controls, and was taking good photographs.  It has a built in light meter display, so you can adjust your settings to get appropriate light, before you shoot the picture.
One nice thing is that the camera shuts off if you accidentally leave it on, which I have done on several occasions.
The only complaint I have is the autofocus. I shoot photos of animals indoors, and I have enough to worry about without having to manually focus the camera.  At the same time, I need this kind of camera to have control of lighting.  The autofocus in these situations is too slow, or it seems confused and unable to choose what to focus on. 
Loading photographs onto my PC seems to go very slowly as well.  
I recommend getting the best lens you can afford (widest range of focal lengths) since the one that comes standard in most packages is a little limiting.  You won't regret it.

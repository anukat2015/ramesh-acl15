Title: Awful Tasting Coffee
Content:
This coffeemaker makes the worse coffee I've ever had in my life!  It tastes like the plastic chemical it's made from.  I just wanted a simple coffeemaker when my 17 year old coffeemaker died.  I just bought another brand of coffeemaker yesterday.  What a difference!  I can have a good tasting cup of coffee again that doesn't require me to drive to WaWa in the morning~

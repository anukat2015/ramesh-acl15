Title: GREAT CAMERA
Content:
I had originally planned on getting an XT or XTi, but decided that this camera would be a better fit, and last longer. I'm very glad I made that decision! The pro features that this camera includes are a welcome addition to those of the Rebels.The screen is HUGE, and the control wheel on the back is very nice. High ISO performance (3200) blew me away! If you are on the edge deciding between the XTi and the 40D I would encourage you to get the 40D - it costs more, but it will take you a lot further without upgrading.

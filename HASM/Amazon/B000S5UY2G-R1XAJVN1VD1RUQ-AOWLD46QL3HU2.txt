Title: Good Portable Video Device for Home
Content:
Pros...
Can hold a "boatload" of downloaded movies and files
Just hook it up like an external drive
Has replaced the family DVD player (requires connectivity kit to TV)
Cons...
Nickel and dimed by the accessories and software which you really need
Not too great as a music player (software is poor)
DVR functionality is not practical to schedule with the docking station

Title: IPOD Move Over
Content:
Most of my friends know I like to be different so I compared the Sansa View to various IPODs and went with the View.  Downloading is so easy.  I go to Windows Media Player and just copy my selection to portable device.  It's that easy.  My co-workers bring their IPOD chargers to work everyday and I charge my View once a week, twice if I listen to it eight hours a day.  The only downfall is that accessories are limited.  Best Buys only had one cover made for the View for about $35 and other stores didn't even carry that one.  Besides accessories being hard to get, I'm happy with the Sansa View.  -  JR

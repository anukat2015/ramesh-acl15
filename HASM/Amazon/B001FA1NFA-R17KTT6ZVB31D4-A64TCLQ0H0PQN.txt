Title: works good
Content:
Bought this one for the wife for an upgrade from the shuffle.  she likes the purple and the 8 gig - likes the album graphics displaying while the song is playing.  Also likes the capability of displaying pictures of kids, dogs, family, and friends.  shouldn't run out of memory for a while.

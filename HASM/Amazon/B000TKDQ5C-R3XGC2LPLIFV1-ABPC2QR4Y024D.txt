Title: Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater with Adjustable Thermostat
Content:
This is a wonderful product, I actually have one back at home and I ordered one for where I am residing now, it's a nice source of heat coming from such a small heater. I usually just keep it on the highest notch but on the first level and it does a great job. It would be great for on top of a high tv stand or use it in your office. If you have a Master bedroom, this may be too small in keeping such a room warm. Quality is great and it came before the "due date". Thanks

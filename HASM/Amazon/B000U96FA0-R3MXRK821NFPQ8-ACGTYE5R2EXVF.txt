Title: So far, so good. It performs as advertised.
Content:
My dentist had one of these in his waiting area and I started tinkering with it. I was scolded for temporarily changing its setting to 70 degrees. (Just wanted to see what it felt like since it was set at 63 and wasn't running.)
I asked the receptionist why she was so uptight about this. She advised that when this heater is set at 70 degrees it triggers the office's thermostat (probably 20 feet away) and shuts off heat to the rest of the office.
That's all I had to hear! Now that I own one I'm not disappointed. Not sure about buying a bunch of these and using them to heat the entire house, but a single unit can certainly take the chill out of a moderate size room.
True it doesn't have an automatic shutoff if knocked over but it does run amazingly cool to the touch. Worth the tradeoff. We just don't leave it run unattended for lengthy periods of time.
Give it a shot. It probably won't disappoint.

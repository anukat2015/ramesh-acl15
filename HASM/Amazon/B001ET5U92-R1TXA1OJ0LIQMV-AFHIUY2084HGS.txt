Title: Must have gotten a bad one
Content:
I have been shooting with the Nikon D40 for about three years, and now that it is time to upgrade chose the D90, largely based on all the great reviews.  I must have gotten a bad sample, however, since the picture quality was not as clear or sharply focused as what I was getting already.  The problem wasn't the lens, since I compared both cameras using a new 16-85 Nikon lens, which by-the-way, is a really nice lens. Have to say though that the  color fidelity was excellent and the images could be made to be very nice with image processing.  But I expected more from a camera costing this much and ended up returning it.

Title: MacBook Pro's Awesome!
Content:
This computer and the whole ordering and delivery process were fantastic.  I'm a lifetime Mac addict and this laptop was a replacement for an 8-year old iBook that was still working but very slowly.  The only thing I regret is that I didn't have the foresight to wait until the WWDC and I bought this machine just a couple of weeks before it got a speed bump and a price reduction.  Oh well - timing's everything.
The Amazon description of the machine was in some ways even better than Apple's (better consolidated and all in one place) and it was delivered to my doorstep exactly when promised.  Plus, I was able to use my amazon.com Visa card and some of my reward certificates, didn't have to pay local tax, and got free shipping.
This new MacBook Pro is incredibly fast, I love the glass screen, and I was able to initialize it in no time at all using the Time Machine backup of my desktop machine.  Awesome computer.

Title: Not enough suction for carpet.
Content:
I was disappointed in this machine as soon as I plugged it in.  It does not pick up dog hair out of area rugs or carpets.  It worked well on hardwoods, but don't waste your money on this machine.  The "turbo" nozzle is anything but "turbo".  It needs electricity going to it to be effective, the suction just isn't enough as is.
Beware of who you buy from and what their return policies are.  Vacuums of America charged me  a restocking fee of 15% even though it doesn't state that anywhere on their Amazon pages.  They were even aware that it doesn't state that and were willing to not charge me 15% restocking fee if I purchased a different vacuum from them.  Shady operation.  Now I am going through the Amazon A-Z return guarantee to get the rest of my money back.

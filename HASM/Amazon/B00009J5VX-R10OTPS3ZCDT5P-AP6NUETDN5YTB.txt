Title: Apple Uses Deceptive Sales Practice to Reduce Returns
Content:
Do NOT personalize your IPod with an engraving, which Apple is offering for &quot;free.&quot;  If you do this, you will NOT be able to return your IPod for ANY reason.  This detail is burried in the fine print found in &quot;Other Terms and Conditions.&quot;  This is a deceptive sales practive. The right to return a product is one of the hallmarks of responsible retailing. This warning is in addition to the many caveats regarding the IPod's inferior battery.  Many users have found out the hard way that the &quot;memory effect&quot; degrades the battery in the IPod over time.  You will have to replace it.  Initially, Apple was charging $269 for the repair but they are succumbing to consumer pressure (and class action lawsuits) and offering a $99 replacement program.

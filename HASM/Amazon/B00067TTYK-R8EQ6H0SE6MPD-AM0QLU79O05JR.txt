Title: Nope
Content:
Still has terrible software.  You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.  You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.  Screen review could be better.  Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.

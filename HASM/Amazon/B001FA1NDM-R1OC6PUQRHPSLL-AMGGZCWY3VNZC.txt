Title: Great despite the annoying quirks
Content:
I have the 16G nano and here's a short list of pros and cons:
PROS:
-The BEST mp3 player on the market given the ease of navigation and user-friendly Itunes PC program
-Great small size and look
-Great holsters available
-Improved sound quality from previous 3rd (they widened the bandwidth)
-Resets on its own if the Ipod seems to be moving slower, instead of the previous gen Ipod where you had you reset the Ipod yourself. 
-Cleaner look, navigation wheel is convex and not concave anymore, therefore it doesn't collect dirt or grime like the older Ipods do.
-New "Genius playlist" ability and "shake to shuffle" ability 
CONS:
-Poorer battery life than the previous 3rd gen ipod (do higher Gigs = lower battery life??)
-Syncronizing is floppier than the previous gen Ipod, as in your playlists on the Itunes program may alter because this new Ipod has a tendancy to put everything in alphabetical order, therefore you have to sync it twice in order to charge it up (and keep your song order the way you like it). Therefore, I'd recommend a wall outlet charger.
-The new Itunes 8.1 seems to stop responding when you buy a new song causing lots songs and money (i've lost songs this way and am now am actually NOT purchasing songs on Itunes anymore but instead on Amazon.com or through CD burning... granted, this is not an Ipod problem but an Itunes problem). 
-New "Genius" playlist and "shake to shuffle" are tacked on and basically impractical and useless
-Like previous Ipods, the unit may slow down at times, but just be patient and it'll fix itself. 
Overall, the reason to buy the Ipod is because it is the best mp3 player available, and getting an old model may cost a lot more money (for some strange reason). I've heard horror stories of Zoom and Sandisk players. I put up with the glitches even though they're more of an annoyance than a deal breaker.

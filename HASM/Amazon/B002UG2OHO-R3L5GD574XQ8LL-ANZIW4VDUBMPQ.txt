Title: Not worth the money
Content:
I have had this coffee maker for three months and am very unhappy with it. The water gauge is difficult to see. The place to fill the water tank is very difficult to hit accurately. If not hit accurately water runs on the heating plate. The carafe drips when coffee is poured. In the past rwo weeks the heating plate will not shut off when the on/off button is pressed. The machine must be unplugged to turn it off.

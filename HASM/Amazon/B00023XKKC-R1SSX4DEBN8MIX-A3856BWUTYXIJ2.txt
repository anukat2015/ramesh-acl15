Title: Is Not Self-evaporating in Mid Atlantic area
Content:
We are well satisfied with the cooling capacity of our Mac 10 but if you live in a high humidity area do not plan on the unit keeping up with the amount of moisture produced.  We were having to empty the very small reserve tank every 2 hours and were getting about 2 cups of water each time.  The tap to empty is in a very inconvenient place.  We finally drilled a hole in our floor into the basement and attached a hose to it.  Now it drains directly into a wash tub in the basement and we empty that into the sump hole every couple of days.  Again, the cooling capacity is wonderful and takes care of 3 rooms for us but with our humidity the unit can't keep up with evaporation.

Title: Best MP3 player so far
Content:
I have had an iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, Sansa e260, and Sansa Clip.  The Zune blows them all away.
The device itself is small and light, nicer looking than the others.  Sound quality is great, the user interface is very clean and easy to use.  I have not had any of the battery life issues I've seen people complain about.  The bundled headphones are not great (I have Klipsch custom-1s and Sony MDR-V700s), but pretty decent for bundled earbuds - better than the ones that came with the iPod and the Sansa.
The Zune software is great - WORLDS ahead of iTunes in all ways, and has much better syncing options than Windows Media Player or Winamp.  Zune Marketplace/Zune Pass is the best subscription-based music service I've seen yet, and I've tried Napster, Rhapsody, and I have Sirius.  I love the social aspect with the online profile displaying your stats.
All in all, I'm very happy with the Zune 16GB - there are a few quirks in the user interface I haven't gotten the hang of yet, but nothing major.

Title: Electrolux 6989A Oxygen Ultra Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
This is the worst vacuum cleaner I ever owned. Until month ego I used Kenmore canister vacuum. After 9 years I decided it's time for new one so I purchased Electrolux. And today I'm asking myself why?  Filter bags are so small, they need to be replace after two times of use. Belt broke after 22 days of use. I tried local Electrolux dealers - they don't stock belt for my model. I called Electrolux parts dept. - guess what - out of stock. So I `m proud owner of $ 500.00 machine and waiting for parts so I can clean my house.

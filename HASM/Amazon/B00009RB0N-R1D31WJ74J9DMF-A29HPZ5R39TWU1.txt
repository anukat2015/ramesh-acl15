Title: This vacuum is really terrible
Content:
Even though I read the negative reviews on here I purchased this vacuum because Amazon had it at $8, so I thought what the heck. Well I wish I had my $8 back. I should have saved the box and returned it. I could not tell you about the battery life because the sucking power is so poor I only used it for a couple of minutes. I was hoping that this would be useful for spot cleaning the cars instead of plugging in the shop vac, but it is really just a waste of time. The only thing I use it for now is to walk around real quick in the house to vacuum up spot of dog hair here and there off the hardwood floors.

Title: Quality Vacuum but too small of a disposable bag
Content:
Don't expect to use this vacuum for ALL your cleaning needs. Its excellent quality , with nice features and GREAT suction, however the disposable bag is much too small. I vacuumed 2 wool rugs that are a year old and previously vacuumed many times with my old Oreck and filled the bag the first time I used it. Folds up to a small foot print and the wire recoil is a nice feature but its demise is the small bag unless you don't mind purchasing bags frequently

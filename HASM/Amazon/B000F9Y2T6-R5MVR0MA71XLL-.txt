Title: Shouldnt have wasted my money
Content:
I should have listened to all the bad reviews, my product just leaves puddles of water on my tile and does exactly what I said, LEAVES PUDDLES, It has NO suction power on the wet side.  The dirty collection was so clean, I could have drank the luke warm water out of it.  I am going back to a regular mop.

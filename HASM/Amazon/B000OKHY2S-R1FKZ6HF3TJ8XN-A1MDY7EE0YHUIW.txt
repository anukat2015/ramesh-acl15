Title: Don't Believe the Hype
Content:
I bought this unit based on the relatively positive reviews it was receiving. I have had lots of experience with swamp coolers, and I live in a part of California where there is the kind of low humidity that a unit like this requires. Nonetheless, it was completely ineffectual as cooler; no matter how much ice you add, it will not produce air that's much cooler than what's being pushed through a standard fan. What it does produce is humidity, and lots of it. One of the positive reviews I read about this product claimed just the opposite, but I assure you that such promises are false. You'd be better off looking for other cooling options.

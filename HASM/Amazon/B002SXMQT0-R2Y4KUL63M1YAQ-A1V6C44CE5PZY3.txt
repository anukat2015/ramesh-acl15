Title: HP Laptop is tops!
Content:
This laptop was purchased to use in addition to our desktop. It is a perfect addition to our home office. It is lightweight, fast efficient, and came with Windows 7 preloaded. If there is any complaint, it is that the battery life is not as long as claimed. For me, it only seems to stay charged for about 2 hours before needing to be plugged in, and that may be due to the fact I play lots of games on it. Over all it is an excellent laptop, and I highly recommend it.

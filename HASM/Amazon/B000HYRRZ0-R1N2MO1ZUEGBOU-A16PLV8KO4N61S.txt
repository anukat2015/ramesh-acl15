Title: Good suction, quiet, very hard to use, bad controls
Content:
I have two mieles.  My old one is great.  They have cheapened the new models as follows: 1, the hose union with the vacuum no longer swivels.  This means the vacuum cleaner goes head over heals and ends up upside-down; 2) the power and cord rewind switches have now been put on angles so that your foot slips off and it is very hard to turn on and off and rewind the cord.  They were too stupid to realize that when the appliance is on wheels and you put the switches on at an angle, rather than parallel with the floor, the machine just scoots away.  Don't buy.

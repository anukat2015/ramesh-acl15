Title: Got more than expected
Content:
I needed a backup camera body for my existing system because I am going to be a photographer for a group of about 100 people going on a cruise. I placed the order with some concern. Would the pre-owned product operate properly and arrive on time (or at all)? As soon as the body arrived I compared all its functions to my existing camera body. I now have them both organized identically, so that I can switch between camera bodies instantly and not miss a beat. The camera delivers as expected. In addition, there were some extras: The body came with storage media and an OEM battery, something I didn't expect. In addition, it came with an OEM battery charger! That was a pleasant surprise. I would trust this seller for any future purchases.

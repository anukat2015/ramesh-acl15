Title: Cannot Take Pictures Out of the Box...
Content:
This totally amazes me...! 
Isn't the purpose of a digital camera to take a picture? 
And yet, when you take this camera out of the box you cannot take a single digital picture with it unless you've purchased a separate CF Card.  You would think that for 600.00 they would throw one in for you?
To make matters worse it's not clearly or obviously noted on Amazon or in the Canon description that a CF Card is or is not included with this camera.  Let me tell you... it is NOT included! Surprise!!!!

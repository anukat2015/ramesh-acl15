Title: When it worked it was fair... Not anymore
Content:
I bought this Cuisinart model DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand in January 2009. It looked interesting and made very good coffee.  It always accumulated water underneath it, however, causing water stains on my granite counter. And now, 6 months later, it won't turn on.  That's a lot of money to spend for 6 months of usage.  I'm very disappointed.

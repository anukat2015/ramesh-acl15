Title: Long Lasting, good coffee
Content:
I just thought I'd take a minute to rate this coffee maker.  I bought this in 2003, six years ago.  I had been frustrated with coffee makers that limed up after about a year from living on well water and thought this might do the trick.  Boy was I right.  The key is using the filters 
This coffee maker is now 6 years old and still brewing a good cup of coffee.  I run a coffee cleaner liquid through it about once a year (don't forget to take your filter when you clean it).  It brews about 8-9 pots of coffee a week.  
Simple math says I've put about 2400 pots of coffee through this coffeemaker and it's still working just fine.  I came back to Amazon to order some new filters and thought I'd see if the maker was still available.

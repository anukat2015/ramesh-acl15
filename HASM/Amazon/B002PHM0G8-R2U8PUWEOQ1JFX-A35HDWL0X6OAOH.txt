Title: Sony Vaio VGN-FW510F
Content:
Great computer for its size and price. Bought a Toshiba satellite and the thing keept heating up over and over. So we took it back to the store and decided to purchase this model since my wife already had a vaio(smaller size)she recommended I take a look at Sony's laptops. I love the speed screen size and the fact that it doesn't overheat compare to the toshiba. Only reason I didn't give a 5 stars was that it didn't come with a Blue Ray DVD player. Other than that it works great and the memory is more than enough with all the other little perks like windows 7 are great.

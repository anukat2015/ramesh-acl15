Title: 2 Defective Heaters in a row?
Content:
I read a few very good reviews about this product and decided to buy it for my room.  I read through the manual and turned on the first one, and a small puff of air came out with a bit of steam.  After that, it was barely warm.  I figured this was damaged or defective and requested an exchange.  Amazon was extremely quick about this as I literally received the replacement a day later.  Sadly, the second one did the very same thing.  Neither of the two generated anything close to a noticeable amount of heat.  The ironic part is that my $20 heater that I use at the office works 100X better than this.  The only A+ goes to Amazon's awesome service, the product however is awful.

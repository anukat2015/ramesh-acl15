Title: Great Quality!!
Content:
I got this for my wife for her birthday, and she absolutely loved it!!  It is compatible with all of her lenses for her 35mm Canon.  She's not a huge fan of digital cameras, but this is an exception.  The price could not be beat when you compare with local retail stores.  The only downside is that there is no microphone to record audio with the video.  Other than that, this camera fits our needs and then some!

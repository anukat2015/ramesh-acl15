Title: did anyone try this before putting into production?
Content:
Virtually impossible to pour water into the coffee maker or pour a cup of coffee without a mess on the counter. "sneak a cup" feature worked for about 2 weeks and now leaks. When you open the lid on the coffeemaker any condensation runs down the hinge and down the back of the machine.  Auto turn off works most of the time, but not always so can't depend on it.  If I try to have the coffee maker set up and ready to turn on later it leaks water all over.  This is the second one we've had in 5 months--both had same problems.  You know you have a cheap product when the store replaces with no questions asked AND tells you not to return the old one "just throw it away".  We're switching to another brand.

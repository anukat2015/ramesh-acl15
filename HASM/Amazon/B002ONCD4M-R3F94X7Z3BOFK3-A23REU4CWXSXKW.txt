Title: Very pleased with purchase
Content:
I bought this during the Holiday sale for $600 to replace my old compaq that broke. I've had it for four months now and it's still going strong. I'm very happy with it. Plays movies well, great sound, well built, fast (boots up in about 30 secs), responsive, quiet, Windows 7, keypad. It's a tad bit lighter than my old one as well, and the battery life is way longer! If it doesn't reach the advertised 8 hours, it comes pretty darn close! It has four USB ports and I love the SD slot - makes it so easy to download pictures! I've read some reviews that complain about it being a fingerprint magnet, but I don't think it's really visible unless you're really looking for it. I use this laptop as a college business student who likes to work with photographs, dabble in digital art, and surf the web. This machine fits the bill for all of that!

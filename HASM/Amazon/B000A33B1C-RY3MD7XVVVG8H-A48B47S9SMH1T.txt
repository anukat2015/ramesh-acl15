Title: Think twice
Content:
This heater sort of heated the room and was used for an hour.  The next day (less than 24 hours after buying it) the lights came on as expected, after turning it on, but there was no heat.  That was after giving the unit thirty minutes to heat up.  About ten minutes later the lights went out, and still no indication of heat.  Being an electronics engineer I thought I had better check to be sure that the unit was getting AC, and it was.  The unit is very dead and I am returning it.

Title: Worth every penny
Content:
My drafty little cottage is hard to heat.  I tried an oil filled radiator.  I tried a triple ceramic tower with fan.  I still had to wear my coat.  Together those two units cost less than half than this one.  I should have just spent the money and bought this unit.  It uses the same 1500W (at full power, there's also a 750W setting) and now I wear a sweater.  Like the other reviewer I haven't noticed the unit get hot to the touch at all.  And it looks charming too.  Yeah, it costs more, but it's worth it if you really need the heat.

Title: Junk-Do not buy
Content:
Piece of junk.  This is supposed to be an "entertainment" PC, so you would think it can play DVD's easily.  Mine did not.  Every time I put a DVD in the drive, it sonn ejected the disk and asked me to put a DVD in the drive.  Turns out that the HP DVD software was fighting with Media Player, so I had to uninstall the HP DVD software.  Don't they test this stuff at all?  Also the speaker volume is so low that it is esentially useless, and the quality of the sound that does come out is very bad.  Also has Windows Vista which I had no prior experience with, but now I know why everyone hates it.  Battery life is terrible-less than 1 hour.  The HP remote control that came with the system is a flimsy piece of crap that doesn't always work.  Screen has a lot of glare and is hard to see unless the romm is darkened.  This computer also runs very very slowly.  Overall, a huge piece of junk and I am very disappointed.

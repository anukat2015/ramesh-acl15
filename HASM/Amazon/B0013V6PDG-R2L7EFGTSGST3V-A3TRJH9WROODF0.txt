Title: No more cold feet or legs!
Content:
I work in a medical office which has to have air flow constantly circulating in the treatment rooms so they won't get too warm.  I was using a ceramic space heater which blows hot air - not very good to use under my desk which could cause the computer to overheat, much less the expense of running one of those!  Anyhow, the docs suggested Toasty Toes.  I just received it today, plugged it in and it works wonderfully!  I can even feel the heat through my shoes and on my calves.  It's not overly hot under the desk, so the computer is a bit more safe!  I recommend this to anyone who suffers from cold feet in the winter!  I'm even thinking about getting one for my desk at home!  A great investment!

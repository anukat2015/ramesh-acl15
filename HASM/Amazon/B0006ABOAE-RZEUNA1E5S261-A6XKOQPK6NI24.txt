Title: Very good machine for little cost.
Content:
We were hesitant to purchase this because the price was so low compared to other machines with similar features, but we gave it a shot.  We are glad that we did, we are very pleased with it.
My only advice is that when you are steaming milk, add some extra water to the reservoir instead of just using the left over water as it recommends.  The left over water was never enough to steam it to an acceptable level of foam.  
We feel it is a good value for the money, makes a good cup of coffee and good expresso.
Oh, one more thing, pour slowly out of the the coffee pitcher, if you try to pour a lot out, it leaks from the side of the spout and you will have a big mess.

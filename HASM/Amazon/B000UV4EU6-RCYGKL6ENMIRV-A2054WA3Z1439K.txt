Title: Buyer beware
Content:
Bought this product 02 April 2008 from Walmart in Suffolk, Virginia. I have used several MP3 players in the past and have never had so much problem with one as this. I use "Rhapsody to go" to load software which works fine with my other MP3 player. I was able to load about 2GB worth of MP3s before the device reported it was full (it's a 4GB version). The system reports it has 4GB, but no additional files can be added after about 2GB. I decided to use the device anyway. Unfortunately, it randomly "locks up" every once in a while (usually while navigating through the menus or after hooking it up to the computer). I decided to check Creative's website. They recommend reformatting the device or loading the latest firmware (I had the latest firmware but reloaded it anyway). After trying all of these things I still have the same problems. Usually works fine if I only put on a few songs and I don't mind sticking the pin in to hit the reset switch (only way to unlock it when it freezes). However, I was expecting a little more for what I paid (at least the ability to use all of the advertised memory). When its working, it appears to be a good little product. However, I'm very frustrated at how much time I've wasted trying to reload my music.
Guess I'll have to buy another one :( ... (definitely a different model/brand to be safe)

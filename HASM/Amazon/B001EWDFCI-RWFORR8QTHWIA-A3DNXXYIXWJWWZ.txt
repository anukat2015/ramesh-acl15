Title: zune is better than ipod
Content:
I purchased the 8gb zune and think its great.  I purchased another one for my 21yr old daughter.  She likes this better than the ipod because it is so much easier to download music and we can have two different zune playlist on the same computer with is not something that is easily done with the ipod.  We used the zune pass included and then continued to pay the monthly fee of $15 to use their unlimited downloads.  This is the best service and we can use this service for both of us.  
The sound is good. The zune is easy to use and i had no problem downloading the software.  The speed of downloading is good and i also use it for my audiobooks and it stays at the place where i left off.  I have tried to use so many other mp3 players for audiobooks and have had trouble.  The zune also has a radio with is nice.   I have yet to find fault with this player or the zune marketplace.

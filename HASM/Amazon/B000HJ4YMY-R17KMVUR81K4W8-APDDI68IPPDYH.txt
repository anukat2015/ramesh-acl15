Title: Absolutely LOVE this camera
Content:
So much has already been said about the D80 that i will not go into too much detail...
This is by far my best camera. (i have owned many cannons, sonys, other nikons, etc.)  it has so many awesome features and i have been able to take many great action shots that always came out blurry before.  it is also GREAT in low light, and long shutter speeds.
it may take some time to learn all the different features, but definitely worth the time investment.
the only disadvantage i would say about this camera is the poorly written owners manual.  i would recommmend getting the magic lantern dvd.  it goes into detail about how to use the camera without going into too much detail about photography that most users of the D80 will already know.
with all that being said, i hope you all enjoy your D80's it truely is a great camera.

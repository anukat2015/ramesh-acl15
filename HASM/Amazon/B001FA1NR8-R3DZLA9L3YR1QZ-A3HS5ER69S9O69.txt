Title: finally i made a good mp3 choice
Content:
I have been skeptical of apple's mp3 players from the start and vowed to not purchase one.  I had a philips go gear 8 gb first, which worked alright and then i purchased a 80 gb microsoft zune, which i promptly returned to the store because what i thought was an upgrade was actually an inferior product to the philips.  So i finally caved and bought an ipod.  I could not have been happier with this purchase.  The apple itunes store is so user-friendly that it makes the ipod that much better.  And the clip attached is great for running or walking.  The ear plugs are junk compared to a good company (why they get 4 out of 5 stars), but they do the job for now.  It was a pain to transfer all the music files to itunes, and i had to do a lot of extra work searching for, cutting, and pasting album art; but now that it is done i do not regret it.  I also purchased a 32gb ipod touch and am very pleased with that product as well.  I took a chance on apple and they did not disappoint (unlike some companies: i.e. microsoft).  Now I realize why apple has such a strong hold on the market; they have put out a great product with strong support and a long lifetime.

Title: Great portable camera, buy with the 20mm kit lens instead
Content:
I've only owned point-and-shoots or super-zoom cameras so far, but I wanted something better and was researching D-SLRs. However I realized I wouldn't carry a big camera with me all the time, so I turned to the micro-4/3 cameras.
I've compared the Olympus EP1 with the Lumix GF1, and I found the GF1 better due the faster auto-focus and the built-in flash.
I bought it with 14-45mm kit lens, however I recommend purchasing the model with the 20mm f/1.7 pancake lens instead, which turns the GF1 into a really portable camera. Later I bought the 20mm f/1.7 Pancake Lens separately and I found I keep the pancake lens on the camera most of the time, as it's much more compact and convenient to carry with me. I also recommend the Lowepro Apex 60 AW (Black) bag that fits perfectly the camera with the pancake lens (no space for the 14-45mm lens however).
The 14-45mm kit is very practical, but gives only a short 3x zoom. Better range you can find on the Panasonic 14-140mm f/4.0-5.8 lens, however that's much more expensive.
Overall, highly recommended camera if you're looking for something with much better image quality than point-and-shoot or super-zooms, but don't want to carry the bulk of a D-SLR camera.

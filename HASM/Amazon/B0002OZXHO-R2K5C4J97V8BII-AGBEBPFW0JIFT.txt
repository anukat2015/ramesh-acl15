Title: Wish it were both PC and Mac compatible at the same time.
Content:
I have a PC at work and Mac at home and can't put songs on the iPod from both computers.
I also agree with other reviewers that it gets ridiculously scratched very easily (just from being in my purse one day the back looks horrible.)  How about a little more functionality over design Apple?
Other than that, great buy for the remaining B&W 4Gs still available.

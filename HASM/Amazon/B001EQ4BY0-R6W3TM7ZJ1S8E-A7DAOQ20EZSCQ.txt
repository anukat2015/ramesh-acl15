Title: Excellent Overall
Content:
I have been using my Canon 50D since August and I must say it is fantastic. It takes incredible pictures and is fairly easy to learn to use, considering it is an SLR. the lenses can be replaced with ease, and the camera itself is very sturdy and well-built. My one complaint would be that it is quite heavy, though this is to be expected with a camera of this type. I would highly recommend this camera to serious amateur photographers who are considering a high quality SLR with all the bells and whistles.

Title: Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater
Content:
I bought this to heat my Airstream Trailer when I have it hooked up to the camp site power.  I am extremely pleased with its capability and quiet operation.  It maintains a steady temperature throughout the trailer even in 20 degree temps.  I have not found a need for the remote control, but it might come in handy for someone using it in their home.

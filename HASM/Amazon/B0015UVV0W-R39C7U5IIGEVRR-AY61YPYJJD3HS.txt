Title: Solid and works well
Content:
This is a good large room heater.  Solid construction and the remote is a nice touch.
I have one major issue however.  The thermostat seems to be located in an area of the heater where it will get warmed up by the heater itself.  What this means is that the room might be 70 degrees but the heater reads 73 degrees.  It's a small nuisance, we overcome it by setting it higher or running the fan only for a minute and then switching back to heat.  The fan then heat trick proves that the thermostat is getting hot from the heater itself and is therefore not accurate.

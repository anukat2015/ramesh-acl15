Title: GREAT HEATER
Content:
I bought this because there is no  insulation in the walls and i live on long island, ny so as many of u may know it gets pretty cold out here...so far i havent gotten to try it out in very cold weather but around 50 degrees....it works great this is the best little heater ever.  it warms up my bathroom in 5 minutes ... and my sons room which is a small room it takes 20 minutes to warm up.  I love this thing..

Title: Dirt Devil does the dirty work!
Content:
I Love my dirt devil for the following reasons:  It's nice and light--easy to carry by one of the two handy carrying handles, or strap on my back, especially when cleaning things like ceilings, walls, drapes, and stairs.  The hose is very long and flexible, as is the cord, and there are a multitude of attachments.  It is also compatible with many of the attachments I already have from other (dead) vacuums.  I like not having to buy bags, too.  The suction power is great,and it does a great job picking up pet hair, which scores big points with me.
The things I don't like about it are: It's not the BEST vacuum I've used on carpet, especially plush types, but it's OK.  The brush attachment helps.  Also, it's really quite LOUD, particularly for such a little unit.  The other thing is that emptying the dirt cup is annoying.  The dirt jams into the folds of the hepa filter and you have to take the hepa filter out and bash it and shake it to get the dirt out, and then you get dust all over yourself as it wafts through the air. Do this OUTSIDE, and wear an apron! A tool of some kind, like a specially made brush would maybe help the situation, but I can't think of anything to use.  Maybe the Dirt Devil people can come up with something.  Other than that, it's well worth the money, and will get the job done as well as a lot of the other spendier vacuums I have tried--I am in the cleaning business, so I have used quite a few vacuums in my day.

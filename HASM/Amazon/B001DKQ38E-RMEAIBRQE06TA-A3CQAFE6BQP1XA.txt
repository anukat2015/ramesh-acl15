Title: Not Recommended
Content:
We wanted a 4-cup coffee brewer to replace our 4-cup Cuisinart that dribbles when pouring.
We did not like the Jerdon.  The lid on the carafe was difficult to remove and, worst of all, when the light went out, meaning it was done brewing, the coffee was still coming through.  There was no way of telling when it was done dripping and there is no shut off when the pot is pulled out. What a mess!!

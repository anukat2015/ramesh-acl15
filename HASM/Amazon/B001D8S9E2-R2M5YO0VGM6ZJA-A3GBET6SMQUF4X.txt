Title: Superb Computer! Amazing Quality & Functionality!
Content:
Purchased my daughter's new Macbook 2.0 Ghz from Amazon. Excellent shipping & flawless delivery of perfect product as usual with Amazon. This particular computer is absolutely amazing. The "solid" aluminum body is a different creature altogether. Typical excellence delivered by Apple, and this LED display is more brilliant than you can imagine; superior to the LCD on the white Macbook, but both have their advantages (the LCD is not as visible from a side-view; security consideration). Nevertheless, this is the finest laptop line I've seen yet from Apple. They just keep getting better and better. If you're looking for a great computer for your kid going to college, this is the perfect size (not too large to carry, yet solid and rigid construction). I strongly recommend purchasing the AppleCare (3 year warranty), and Mobile Me, as well as the Mac Box Set (which has iLife and iWork - the later does a brilliant job of functioning as a Microsoft Office substitute), and you can use the remaining software (Leopard & iLife - which is already installed on this computer) on another Apple you may already have. 
Strongly recommend this computer. Excellent in every way.

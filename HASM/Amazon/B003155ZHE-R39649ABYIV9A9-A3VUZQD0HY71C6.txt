Title: Very Happy
Content:
There is an identical listing for $599.99 except it has a 500gb Hard Drive, make sure to take advantage of the additional 180gb for $0.31. 
I received my laptop and I am extremely pleased so far. The blue shell is much more of a midnight blue and doesn't look anything like these stock photos. Also, as for the design of the laptop you have nothing to worry about, it is very sleek and has some blue accent lighting around the power button and other buttons, which makes it look very very sharp. I read another review where the design was the only problem with this laptop so I was slightly worried, but now that I own it I could not be happier. 
I'm going to skip reviewing the internal specs because the first review sums up everything you need to know regarding the hardware.

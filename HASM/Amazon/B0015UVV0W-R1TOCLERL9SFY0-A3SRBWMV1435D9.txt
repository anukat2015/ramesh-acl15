Title: LOVE it!
Content:
We purchased the Vornado Touch Stone Vortex Heat 500 about a month ago.  We have a room that is consistently colder than the other rooms in the house.  We don't understand WHY it is colder since it was an addition, attached to the main central air /forced air heating unit, is actually BETTER insulated with more up-to-date windows, but is about 6 degrees colder (warmer in the summer) than any other room in the house.  I plugged the Vornado in and the room is actually WARM!  I am very impressed with this little, very quiet... you can't hardly tell it is running!... machine.  I would definately recommend it to anyone that has this problem.  We DO have a Sony TV/Remote, but the TV is in another room and doesn't affect the use of the machine.  Actually, I leave ours on all the time and don't even need the remote.  If this is the case I would go with the pp suggestion with getting the version without the remote.  Had I realized that it was just as powerful I would have saved a few dollars and gone with the remoteless one for our use.  HIGHLY recommend this item.  I am very pleasantly surprised at how well this little unit works.

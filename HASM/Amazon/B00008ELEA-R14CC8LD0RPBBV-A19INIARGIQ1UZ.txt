Title: Love it, but do not buy the suggested glass top
Content:
I have had the percolator for about a week now and absolutely love it.  It is so much cuter than those beasty drip machines.  Easy to keep clean and shiny, again unlike the drip machines that always look dirty.  The coffee is very smooth and much hotter than with the drip machines.  The cats had a little trouble with the "noise" of the perking at first.  
I would like to point out that Amazon suggests you purchase a glass top as part of the order.  I thought that would be great to be able to see the coffee perking, just as I did when I saw my mom and dad's old Corningware stovetop percolator when I was  kid.  The item they suggest from a partner, thepartsbiz, DOES NOT fit this percolator.  It was under $3.00, but had nearly $5.00 in S&H.  I felt $7.74 would be OK, but now that I know it won't work, I am out $7.74 and it isn't cost effective to return it.

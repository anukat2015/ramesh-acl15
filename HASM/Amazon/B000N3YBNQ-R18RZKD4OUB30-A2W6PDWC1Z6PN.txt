Title: off button problem but service good
Content:
in general I found this product live up to my expectation given its price. It's not super quiet but tolerable, much better than the up-right vacuums worth $30-60 I've used before. Navigation with this product is a bit difficult on wooden floors, because the machine is heavy and the wheels feel a bit stuck.
I returned the product mainly because the off button is not reliable. I opened the box and the second time I tried it, the off button won't work and I have to unplug the machine. I encountered the same problem again the next day and decided to return it. But the seller is very good at dealing with the return. Essentially I called Electrolux to get an incidence number and then give the number to CPO and they processed the return immediately. Then I just print out the return label and drop it off at a FedEX.

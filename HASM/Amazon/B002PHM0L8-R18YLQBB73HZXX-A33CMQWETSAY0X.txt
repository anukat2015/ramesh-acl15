Title: Great Laptop, Terrible Battery
Content:
Laptop is great but the battery is horrible.  I get about 2 hours on a charge under the "balanced" power setting.  The battery also discharges quickly when not in use (~10% per day).  Worst of all, the cost to get a second battery is exorbitant - $200 for a regular, and $250 for a higher capacity one.
If battery life isn't a concern, this laptop has it all.  If battery life is an issue for you, I suggest that you look elsewhere.

Title: Excellent product,But........
Content:
This convection heater works very well at heating my 12x14 living room, and it is very quiet while in operation.The heater is very sturdy and attractive looking. However, the supposedly "cool touch metal cabinet" gets extremely hot. I let out a few four-letter words when I touched the heater, and I have a high threshhold for pain.In my opinion, this heater is worth the money, because it does do an excellent job at warming up the area.However, please be careful with this heater if you have children.

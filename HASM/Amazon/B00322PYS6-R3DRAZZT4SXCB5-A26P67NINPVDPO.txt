Title: Over heating ?
Content:
Has anyone noticed any heat problems with this laptop ? Was watching a DVD on the laptop, and fell asleep for a while. When I woke up and picked up the laptop on the left side where the cooling vent is, it was way too hot to hold. I like this laptop, but will probably send it back. Think it could be hot enough to cause a burn.

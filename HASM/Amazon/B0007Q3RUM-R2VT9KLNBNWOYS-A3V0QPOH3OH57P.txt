Title: Excellent
Content:
This heater works very well. I don't need a "fan only" setting in the winter (see previous review). Anyway, I bought it for an uninsulated attic bedroom about 16x12. Keeps the room warm, runs quietly, and doesn't have a noticeable effect on the electric bill. The remote control adds to the convenience. If you buy something else, be sure it has remote.

Title: replacment batteries are $390
Content:
Hi,
my aw120j battery runs out in one and half hour.  When I try to buy a backup battery, I found out that they are out of stock and are proprietary - so it will cost me more - about $390 to buy the larger capacity (with 50% more juice).  I can buy a computer with that exorbitant $390!!
This computer is too large to lug around and I wish the keys are white.  There are too many Vista software running which churns the hard drive, so I turned of superfetch, windows defender, and other services not needed.  Google for superfetch and you find techgeek - he has the list of recommended services to turn off.

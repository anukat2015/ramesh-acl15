Title: If I only had pets it would be OK.
Content:
I personally HATE this vacuum.  It seems to work OK on the pet hair, but doesn't pick anything else up....let me rephrase that...it picks everything up and then spits it back out.  If I want to vacuum my childrens rooms I have to use the hose.  I've found myself just borrowing my neighbors vacuum while this HUGE ol' thing sits in the closet.  What a waste of money!!!

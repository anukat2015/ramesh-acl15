Title: Proud To Call It Mine
Content:
When I first received my Zune mp3 player as a Christmas gift over a year ago, I was a little disappointed because I hadn't heard much about the Zune. I obviously hadn't been looking in the right places, because now I'd like to upgrade to the 16 GB for more space. 
  With the Zune Pass, you pay 14.99 a month for a nearly endless access of music for you to download, and you receive 10 songs for you to keep. It's like buying a CD but also "borrowing" as many songs that will fit on your Zune to listen to. You also have access to TV shows you can buy for about $2 per episode and podcasts you can get for free. Just these features make the Zune well worth its price. 
  The other Zune features are icing on the cake. With channels you can listen to the top songs on Zune Marketplace, the songs on the billboard, or a collection of the top Hip Hop songs. The wireless features let you download songs at hotspots quickly and easily. You can even "buy from FM" by adding the song a radio station is playing to your cart.
  I am very pleased with my Zune, and would (and do) recommend it to anyone looking for an mp3 player. I don't think it even compares to mp3 players I've had or the ones my friends have (that includes ipods).

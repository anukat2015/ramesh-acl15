Title: Old version was better
Content:
This is my second coffee maker of this type.  First one I had for many years and though it still worked fine, I decided it was time for a new one because the filter wasn't filtering as nicely as it used to.  My biggest disappointment with the new one is that it's so "drippy".  when I remove the filter and filter basket to dump and rinse them - it drips all over everything.  The old one never used to do that.  Other than that, it's as good as the previous one.  When I'm the only coffee drinker in the house - it's perfect for the job!

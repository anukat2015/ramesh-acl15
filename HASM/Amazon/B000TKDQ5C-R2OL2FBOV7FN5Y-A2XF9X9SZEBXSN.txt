Title: Accomplishes its intended function quite well
Content:
My wife and I bought this to maintain the temperature in our nursery (which always seemed to get much cooler than the rest of the house in the winter), and it works precisely as advertised.
Pros: Small size. Easy to use temperature dial. Effective at maintaining a temp in a small room (10' by 12' ish) without blasting it with heat. The surface of the unit itself does not get overly hot - even when it has been running for some time, it can still be picked up and moved without issue.
Cons: Some have mentioned the noise. I don't know what one expects with a device like this, it is going to make some noise. But if it is any help: we keep this on all night in a room with a sleeping baby and it doesn't disturb the infant slumber. So, it's not that bad.

Title: I LOVE THIS CAMERA
Content:
IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A D-SLR CAMERA I HIGHLY SUGGEST THE NIKON D60.  IT IS AFFORDABLE AND THE PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT.  THE 18-55 ZOOM LENS THAT CAME WITH IT WORKS WELL BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE MORE, YOU CAN PICK UP THE 55-200 LENS PACKAGE FOR UNDER $200.  THIS IS A CAMERA THAT I WILL HAVE AND ENJOY FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.

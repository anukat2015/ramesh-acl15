Title: Why pay more for less features and quality?
Content:
I'll make this very short.  I really like this camera and everyone here posts many positive features so I am only going to feature the few drawbacks.  I think that it should come with a faster lens, at least f/2.5, I mean come on how are you going to use the 1/4000 sec. with this lens.  Coming out of sleep mode is not instant!  I expected it to be and I missed a shot because of it.  Whatever happened to the hour long shutter speeds?  I get a max. of 8 minutes on BULB - meaning I have to hold the button down, 30 sec. by itself.  Plugging the camera in through the USB corrupted images on my disk - maybe a problem with my camera only. Also the whole 800 1600 ISO thing, but who cares...
Pros-
No need for a Macro lens, with 8MP you can get as close as you want.  Excellent program mode.  As a matter of fact, all pre-programmed exposures are excellent.  Battery life 550+ pics with around 60% flash use.  Auto-white balance is of superior quality.  2.5 fps seems slow at first when compared to the 8 fps of other cameras, but in the field, it's plenty.  
Additional batteries are cheap - buy from a British dealer on eBay for around 9 GBP or $16 including shipping.  I got my camera on eBay for $645 brand new in box with warranty cards.  Also purchased a hotshoe to PC-sync adapter for around 15 AUD or $11 including shipping.  Also a step up ring adapter to use my 67mm filters on this camera with 58mm lenses.  
These few drawbacks are not enough to keep you from saving $800-900 off of the Canon 20D for the same image quality!

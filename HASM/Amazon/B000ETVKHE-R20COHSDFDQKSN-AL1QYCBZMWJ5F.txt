Title: I Love It.
Content:
I love this mp3 player. It is much like the nano except a little bigger but it you can put video and photos on here with the sansa converter software that is included. It also had the mircoSD expansion slot witch is a feature not on my mp3 players but you can only get up to a 2 gig microSD card witch is kinda pricey but the 1 gig microSD card is only 20 bucks on amazon.

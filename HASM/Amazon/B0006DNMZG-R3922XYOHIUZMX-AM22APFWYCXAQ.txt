Title: Great Room Heater
Content:
I bought this product to heat my office which is in the basement of our home. It does a great job on the 20X35 room. It heats it by 5 degrees in 30 minutes and 88-10 degrees in an hour. The thermostat  works well at controlling the temperature over time. The value at &lt; $40 is great !!

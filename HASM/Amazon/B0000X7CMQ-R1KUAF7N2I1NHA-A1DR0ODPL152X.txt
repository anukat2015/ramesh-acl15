Title: Better Than Advertised
Content:
I bought this based on the reviews and the desire to stop having to replace broken glass pots.   I was hesitant because of the filter size complaints (#3) and the screw on lid comments.   I'm glad I ignored both.  The carafe screws on and off easily, and doesn't leak when brewing.  The manual said use a #4 filter, I bought some and they work fine, not sure if this model has been updated from earlier reviews or what.   As for the performance, it brews quickly, although we setup the timer have it waiting for us when we get up.  The coffee is much smoother than our old Mr. Coffee model.   Great product!

Title: Don't buy Farberware Percolators
Content:
This is the LAST TIME I will ever buy a Farberware Percolator. I have purchased aprox 1 a year for the last 5 years they don't last beyond that. My last purchase was Aug 2009. I had it for only one month and the prongs came loose and fell inside the base. It is useless to try and get this fixed. It's a shame Farberware used to be a trusted name but not any more.
I would have given it Zero stars but amazon makes you give it at least one star in order to write the review

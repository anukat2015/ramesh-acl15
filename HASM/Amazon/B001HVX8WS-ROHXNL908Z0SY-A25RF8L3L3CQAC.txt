Title: The D90 is for me!
Content:
I recently purchased the Nikon D90 and an 18mm - 200mm lens, it's a wonderful set-up.  I purchased the instructional DVD to learn the subtleties of using the camera as I am not much of a manual reader, I'm a doer...  Great Camera, great images & the battery seems to last forever.

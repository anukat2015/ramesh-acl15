Title: everyone vacuums now!
Content:
Lightweight, user friendly, easy to clean.  Canister needs emptying almost every time it's used (I have 2 cats one with long hair).  However, that also means I don't overfill the canister and it's ready to use the next time! Price was better than in the local stores (ie Dallas) and other reviews rated this machine as a good product, which we agree.  Windtunnels are were highly rated.

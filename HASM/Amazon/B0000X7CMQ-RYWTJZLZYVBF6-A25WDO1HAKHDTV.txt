Title: Good, not perfect
Content:
My Zojirushi EC-BD15 coffee maker is better than most, but still not perfect.  It brews a great cup of hot coffee and the carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours.  That said, the carafe is somewhat awkward for pouring.  You have to unscrew the lid a bit for the coffee to come out, but it comes out very slowly.  If you open the top too far, it spills.  The coffee maker itself is very tall - doesn't fit under my cupboards.   For the price, though, I would buy it again.

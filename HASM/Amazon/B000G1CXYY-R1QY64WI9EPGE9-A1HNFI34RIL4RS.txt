Title: Does exactly what is promised
Content:
This little heater will warm up a small to medium sized room just fine.  It's not the most quiet heater I've owned, but is great for a small room in the basement for doing frostwatch duty, or supplementing a bedroom.   As with any of these types of heaters, it's warmest by the heater itself.  It does the job as advertised.  No miracles, no surprises.

Title: small problem with dyson DC21
Content:
I read a review about the DC21 and the person had trouble with the motor head. I bought one and had the same problem. The motor head would not stay running for more then 10 seconds. So I called Dyson and and they agreed to send me a new head. So I decided to take the one I had apart because Dyson did not want it back. I found nothing wrong with it. After  checking the connection where the head attaches to the hose I discovered the connection was bad. I took out two screws at the end of the hose pulled out the connectors squeezed them a little tighter with pliers put it back together and it works great. If you have this problem call Dyson to get a new hose not a new headFactory-Reconditioned Dyson 12446-02 DC21 Canister Vacuum

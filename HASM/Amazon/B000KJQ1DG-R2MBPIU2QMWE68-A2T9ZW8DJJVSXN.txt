Title: THE BEST DSLR camera for beginners!
Content:
I think Nikon D40 is one of the BEST cameras for total beginners (such as myself!) who want to learn how to use DSLR cameras. The settings are very easy to use, which makes it that much easier to learn how to use the camera. Pictures come out looking wonderful, even if you're a first-time user. I don't regret one penny spent on this camera. Highly recommend it to any/all beginners :o)

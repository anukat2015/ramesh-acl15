Title: This camera is unbeatable.... unless you are a pro photographer YOU WILL LOVE IT!...
Content:
I will begin by saying that I was very interested in learning more about photography so I bought the Nikon D40 to photograph the family and take occassional scenic photos.  I received the camera, charged the battery for about an hour and then began taking the BEST pictures I had ever taken. (200 the first day)  I did not change any settings...."auto" all the way. Right out of the box the camera is amazing.  
My wife wondered why I wanted a $500 camera and why I just HAD to have the 55-200 VR Lens for $240 more but now I think she would have paid double. With just under two days under our belts there are over 300 pictures on my SDHC card and we are hooked.  I cannot say enough great things about this camera and I'm sure as I learn more about photography with a DSLR my opinion will only get better. This is a great investment for the beginning photographer or soccer mom!  
Would give 10 stars if I could!!!!!

Title: Quality good, battery lifecycle not so
Content:
I don't know if this is the same with every Ipod Mini, but...I bought mine a year and a half ago. It was working great up until last month. I have always run the battery down as Apple has suggested and then fully re-charge the unit before next use.
Unfortunately the battery won't hold a charge for more tham 15 Minutes. Oh well.

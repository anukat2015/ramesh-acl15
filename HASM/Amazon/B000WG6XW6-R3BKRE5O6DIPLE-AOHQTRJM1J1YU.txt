Title: Great Product
Content:
This is my first jump into the major media player market (I own a Creative Zen Nano Plus, but its not in the same market as this).  I love the hardware.  The software is pretty sleak when its working right.  My biggest gripe is that it messes up tags.  But since that's a software issue, I expect it will be fixed.
The device is great.  I love the podcast option, FM radio and the 80GB of hard drive space.  I've used it to listen to music, audiobooks and watch TV shows recorded on my Snapstream DVR PC.  The touch squircle is great and easy to use.  I am very impressed.

Title: Very Poor Quality - Expected More of Hoover
Content:
I purchased the vacuum just under a year ago and it has been the worst vacuum I have ever owned.  The suction in the hose is great, but the attachments keep the hose so far from the floor that it doesn't pick up dust, dirt and pet hair well. All parts of the vacuum are very cheaply made and don't stand up to normal use. The hose constantly kinks, the small beater chews up fabric, and the bags are so poorly made that 50% of them have ripped and those that stay in tact leak dust - they do not live up to their HEPA claims. Additionally, the design is not friendly.  There is no on/off switch on the handle, the attachments do not store or attach to the canister base and the cord is very short.
If you need a good quality canister vacuum consider a Kenmore.  They offer much greater quality and convenience at a similar price.

Title: good item but cheaply made
Content:
This item is a fine product but it is made of cheap plastic. Does just what you would expect. Shipping is also very very slow. It took also two weeks to ship from a very short distance. For some wierd reason they shipped it ups to the post office then the mailman delievered it. I only live a few minutes (2-3) from the post office so this made no sense. The UPS man probably drove past my house to get to the post office.

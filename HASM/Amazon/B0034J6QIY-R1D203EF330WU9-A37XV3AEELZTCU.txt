Title: Not so satisfied
Content:
Sadly, we are on our second Cuisinart SS700 in a month's time.  The pump intermittently stopped working on our first unit.  We purchased it online from [...].  We were able to return it to the closest store, no questions asked.  Our replacement unit has started doing the same thing. The pump will sound as if it is cycling but the water is not flowing through the unit.  It makes for a frustrating start to the day when you can't get that first cup of coffee right away because of having to unplug the machine and restart it several times before the pump kicks in.  We are thinking of switching to a Keurig unit instead.  Lastly, I noticed that BB&B no longer has the product available on their website either.  Can't find a place to buy it online at all at this point... Too bad really, it seemed like such a good machine at first!

Title: Not worth the money
Content:
Pros: It makes coffee
Cons: 
1. It's flimsy
2. The on-off switch is difficult to use. It is placed low down on the side and not very obvious. It doesn't switch off automatically so it's easy to leave the unit switched on
3. It takes a long time to make coffee, and the coffee is barely warm when finished
Summary:
Spend a few more $$s and get a Black and Decker!

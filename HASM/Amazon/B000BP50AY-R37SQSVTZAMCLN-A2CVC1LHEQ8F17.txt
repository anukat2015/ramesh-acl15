Title: Great MP3 player
Content:
This is my introduction to MP3 players so I do not have much experience with them. My daughter owns an IPOD and loves it but I cannot justify the cost. This MP3 player holds plenty of music and I love it. Use it constantly. Last forever on a battery and the sound is of good quality. If you want a inexpensive solution to your portable music this is IT. Great product, easy to use!

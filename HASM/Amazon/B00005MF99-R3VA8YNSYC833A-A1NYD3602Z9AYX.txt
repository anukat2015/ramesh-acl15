Title: Buyers beware (and get your tape measure)
Content:
Are you considering this coffee pot?  It's a good deal, but be careful... 
I had no idea that the top lid flips up pretty high.  I thought the basket slides out on a hinge, which is a popular style.  The reason why this might be a problem for you is because many kitchens have cabinets that hang directly above the counters. For me, every time I go to make coffee, I have to pull the machine way out so that the lid has clearance to open. So make sure you grab a tape measure or ruler and check to see that you have 22" of clearance between the counter and the bottom of your cabinets.
The second problem I encountered was when I plugged in the device, and set the digital clock.  For some reason, an electronics glitch exists on certain pots where the hours count fast while the minutes remain accurate. When you go to fix the time again, the numbers increment way beyond 12, as if it were suddenly in some kind of 24-hour mode (keep in mind, this machine's time is only a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indicator, hence the glitch). This glitch doesn't affect the operation of the coffee machine once it begins brewing, but be sure you save the box in case you wind up with one of these quirky clocks and need to return it to Amazon. I was a little too trusting that the machine would be fine and threw my box away.
If the LED clock actually kept Earth time and I didn't have cabinets hanging directly over this coffee maker, then I might give it a few more stars.  I can say that it does brew good coffee, at least!

Title: So Bad
Content:
I have only had the vacuum a month, and it's doing fine. But, the powered rug attachment came off during vacuuming and a small plastic ring seems to be the way to reattach. That is a little scary!
November news--The Oxygen3 (Eureka really) vacuum is horrible! The plastic ring continued to come off during each use, and the telescoping wand came apart and would not go back together. I traded this vacuum in on a new truly Electrolux Aerus canister vacuum.

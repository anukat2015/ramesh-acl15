Title: Clock impossible to program.
Content:
The machine looks and works fine.  But it's annoying that the clock is impossible to program.  I thought it was on a 24-hour basis, but it switches back to 12:00 after 14:00.  Unless you are using the timer for morning coffee, etc., I would buy the similar model which is a few dollars cheaper and doesn't feature a timer.

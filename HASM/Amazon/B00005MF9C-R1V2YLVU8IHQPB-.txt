Title: Get for On the GO
Content:
This coffee maker is great, its inexpensive and works wonders, and everyone one I know loves it and always compliments me on it. I'm a busy person who doesnt have time to clean that coffee glass pot and pour it into a cup, etc etc, the usual coffee routine. It quick and easy, in 5 minutes you get your coffee and go. The cups are great, Ive had my machine for over a year and its never given any problems, and I never really had a problem with coffee grinds. usually I'm too lazy to use and wash the filter it comes with so I buy paper filters and just throw them away. its also great for making tea or any time you need a Hot cup of water.

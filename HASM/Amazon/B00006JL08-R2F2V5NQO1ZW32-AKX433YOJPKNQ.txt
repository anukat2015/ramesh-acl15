Title: There's a reason why the warranty is limited to 1 year
Content:
I'm writing this review because I came to the Amazon site to check on the replacement cost of this coffee maker. After 1.5 years of daily use, it seems to have died (no power - the screen is blank). Because I invested in a 3 pack of Brita filters (they are expensive!) I thought that I might go ahead and just replace this coffee maker. After all, it's a fairly low-priced option for what you get: the coffee does taste good and the programming feature is handy. However, as others have mentioned, it tends to drip behind the carafe, which can be messy. The mid-brew pour never worked on mine. Though I have the now useless Brita filters, I will most likely try a different brand and model because I'm not interested in annually replacing my coffee maker.

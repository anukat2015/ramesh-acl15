Title: Small but defective?
Content:
My family has had 3 of these go bad over the past year. Each time we were unable to recover from iTunes "Back to Factory" settings. No other way to troubleshoot this particular iPod exists. Yes, it does tell you the error by counting the blinking LED lights, but each time we have not been able to recover it. It is so cheap, that it almost makes it disposable, but 3 bad ones were enough to not recommend it.
Perhaps it would be recoverable at the Apple store, but don't feel like waiting for an 2 hours (1 hour drive and 1 hour wait at the store) to get it fixed. 
Pros : clippable and light. Once you get used to the buttons its easy to navigate
Cons: Goes "kaput" too easy. If you have a few hundred songs on there, it is difficult to find the one you want to hear, sometimes.
I've recently tried the Sandisk Sansa Clip, and much prefer it, at 1/2 the $$. Not sure about Sandisk reliability at this point.

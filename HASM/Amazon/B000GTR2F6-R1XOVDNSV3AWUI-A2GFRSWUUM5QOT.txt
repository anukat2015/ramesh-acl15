Title: Keurig is great, but has a couple of issues
Content:
The B70 is stylish and is precise in making a cup of coffee. The design ensures a minimum of cleaning and avoids the usual need of coffeemakers to get a thorough cleaning to remove residual coffee acids and  that make it bitter, also allowing each cup to be custom made , with many, many flavors, vendors, and blends available (so many, I cant ever remember which one I like the best). that said, it has a couple of issues. the coffee is pretty expensive, with the cheapest coming out to ~50 cents per cup, compared to ~25 cents for other single serving types and at least ten times regular drip coffee makers. I have also had its  software get confused, requiring a cycle of the power, interesting that something as simple as making coffee can be complicated enough to require this (welcome to the 21st century) The only other missing feature is that it doesnt remember your last setting, so you have to push a few buttons to get it the way you want it

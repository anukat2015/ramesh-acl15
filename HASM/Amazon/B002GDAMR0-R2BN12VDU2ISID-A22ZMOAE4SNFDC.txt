Title: Good coffee maker.  Bad math
Content:
Nice machine, makes very good coffee and the carafe is unbreakable.  (Broken carafe with no replacement available is the usual cause of coffee maker replacement in our house.)  One quibble.  The carafe is full to the top at 56 OZ or seven 8-OZ cups.  Is a Cuisinart "cup" equal to 5.6 OZ or are you assumed to pour off the first three cups during brewing to prevent a mess on your counter top?

Title: Great suction but small mouth
Content:
This little machine has great suction for it's size, is reasonably quiet, easy to clean, holds the charge well and is nice-looking.  I just wish the "mouth" was a little bigger as it won't handle stove pellets or "Kix" cereal.  Maybe that's the tradeoff for the suction power?

Title: Canon Rebel EOS
Content:
I upgraded from a Canon Power Shot, which I am very happy with.  The Canon Rebel is very easy to start using, but it also has features that can be used to enhance your photography.  It's exciting to find out all that it can do.  I have used it on nature hikes, close-up photographs, and a wedding and the results have been great!Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black)

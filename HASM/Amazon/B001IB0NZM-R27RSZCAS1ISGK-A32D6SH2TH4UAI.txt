Title: Sadly disappointed
Content:
I was really looking forward to using this vacuum based on all the reviews.  
It comes with 3 paper bags and 1 reusable bag, a carpet head, a slim fit crevice tool and a dusting tool. Convenient retractable electric cord.   
It IS: easy to operate, lightweight, powerful suction, visually appealing, and compact. 
It works well on: hard wood or tile.  
Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with the performance on carpet.  I have low pile carpet, but I do have a short hair dog and I have long hair myself.  The carpet attachment doesn't have any actual spin brushes, only small, stationary brushes that do not actually "lift" anything. 
B/c the carpet attachment doesn't have any wheels and the suction power is strong, it is hard to "roll" it when you are vacuuming carpet.  And the carpet only gets clean in the "middle" of the vacuum head, not the entire length of the brush.  
I was really disappointed since I was looking for a canister vacuum that I can easily carry up and down hard wood stairs...  
I would only recommend if you don't have carpet, or looking for a compact vac. to use for casual dusting or car cleaning.

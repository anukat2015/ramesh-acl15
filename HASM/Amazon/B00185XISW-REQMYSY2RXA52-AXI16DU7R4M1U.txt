Title: Takes edge off a cold room, but won't heat your house...
Content:
I purchased this item after reading the other reviews posted here, and the experience of others is pretty accurate.
I installed this in a master bathroom, (1978-built home; the bath is SMALL by today's McMansion standards,) and the heater seems to be working just as it should.  This bathroom is usually chilly, as it has 3 outside walls, and is located on the north side of our home.
Uncomplicated installation, but I would recommend using enclosed template, or tracing one from the heater itself.  The unit is a large ceramic tile, approximately 24" square, and weighs a good 10 pounds, so if you don't have the template, it can be cumbersome to hold the tile against the wall by yourself.  (I bought this used, from an Amazon 3rd-party seller, and it did not arrive with a template.) It can be installed by one person, which I did.  (Woman pretty handy with tools.)
Works as stated, taking the chill off this room.  Our home is all-electric, no NG or propane, so the winter bills kill us.  (Central air w/heat pump.)  Living in north texas, it doesn't get bone-chilling cold, but regularly freezes, so I've been on a mission the past few years to make our house as efficient as possible, to lower the electric bills.  I will probably buy a few more of these heaters, paint them to match the walls, and install in other rooms.  I would recommend them for 'spot' heating, but don't expect them to heat your entire home or apartment.
Because it takes up no floor space, I appreciate the fact that I will not have to pack this away and haul it up to the attic in the spring, which is something we do with our other space heaters.

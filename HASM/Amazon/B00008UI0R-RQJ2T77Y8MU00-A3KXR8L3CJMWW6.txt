Title: Great Little Canister Vac
Content:
If you are looking for a vacuum that really pulls out dirt, moves easily, has no bags, and doesn't cost a fortune, this is it. I researched for weeks before buying.  The power of the brushhead allows easy carpet vacuuming because it pulls you right along! The edge (crumb sweepers) brushes get to the dirt along the baseboards and furniture. The wand extension works very well without undue effort. Variable power control is at your fingertips and the lighted indicator on the canister top permits exact control for those fragile throw rugs. 
The little powerhead works off suction and I worried about effective cleaning. It works very well. Who knew that "this vacuum really sucks" could be such a good thing! My only gripe is that the frequently used bare floor attachment has no storage spot on the canister. But the long cord and easy retraction button make up for this shortcoming. Worth every penny and more. I'd buy it again.

Title: A great  dSLR camera for beginners
Content:
for a digital SLR, it's both user and cost friendly. at least, for those of us who are just new to digital SLR photography and willing to spend a little more over a "point and shoot" camera. i have had my D40x for about a month now. and i must say i have had a lot of fun with this camera. it's not as sophisticated as the Nikon D80 or D300. but if your like me, who just likes to take pictures of everyday people, events, and travel. then you may come to love this camera as i do. my friends, relatives, and even co-workers are impressed with the results. i dont regret my purchase. i think its a good deal. and i think you may eventually see things the same way too. just try not to get too carried away by all the rants and raves of this or any other camera. your basic needs or purpose should determine your choice.

Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
From the closable bag to the crazy motorized nozzle I think this is the best little vacuum I have ever used.  Not only is it cute looking, but it fits in my tiny apartment.  It practically vacuums the floor itself.  Who cares if they ripped off the name?  This thing is expensive, but a real Electrolux is 2xs the cost. It really gets the dog hair off everything too and fits under most of my furniture.  This vacuum is very well designed and thought out.  I reasearched for days and finally bought this model and am happy enough with it to bother writing this review.

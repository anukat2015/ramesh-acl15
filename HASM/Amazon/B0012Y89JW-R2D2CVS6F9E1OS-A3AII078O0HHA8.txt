Title: Great SLR for price
Content:
This camera is a great digital SLR for the price. 
Coming from regular point and shoot Canons and Sony around 7MP, this camera blows them away in image quality and is just as easy to use as the point and shoots.
Make sure to invest in quality UV or other quality lens protection depending on your intended use for the camera.
Also, getting the higher zoom lens is a must-have with this camera, although most of your pictures will be taken in the 18-55 range with the lens that comes with the camera.
Only thing that could improve on this camera would be to be able to see the picture on the LCD before shooting(like a point and shoot), but I suppose that defeats the whole digital SLR camera's history and function.

Title: Excellent DSLR for enthusiasts
Content:
I was researching to buy a good DSLR since 4-5 months and finally zeroed upon Canon Digital Rebel XT / 350D. This camera is one of the smallest sized DSLRs...feels good in hands (compared to Nikon D70S, etc). The image quality is excellent. Ameatures and pro-enthusiasts would find the camera amazingly easy to use. The autofocus of the kit lens works very well. People who are planning to buy this, make sure to buy at least a 2GB CF card (stores about 550 photos). Smaller cards will run out of storage space in no time!!

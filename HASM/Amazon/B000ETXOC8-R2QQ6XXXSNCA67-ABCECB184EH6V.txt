Title: SanDisk Sansa review
Content:
I am very happy with this product; I got it to replace one just like it which I had dropped and broke (it would no longer charge and the computer didn't recognize it when I hooked it up).  I couldn't get the old one to jump back and forth between songs, but this one works fine.  This one seems a little slower to start up, but other than that, I'm very happy with it.  I love the big screen on the SanDisk e250, it's easy to see and it's easy to operate.

Title: HP Pavilion DV2-1030US Nice looking but "worthless to buy"!
Content:
I know why the price goes down every day!
-works as a turtle and if you open 3 or more internet explorer freezes.
-Battery life instead of factory's notes is so short. No more than 2 hours.
-Blue screen again! I cant believe it. During working with it hanging of system happens and you have to shutdown the system by pressing and holding of power button.
-A lot of bloatware that slows the processor. 
-Touch pad scroller is inaccurate.
I am giving only 1 star for nice looking of it.

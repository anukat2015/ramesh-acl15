Title: great fun!
Content:
at first i was skeptical that i would use this, but having had it a while, i have found it is very fun to have around.  it has renewed my interest in music that i used to listen to, and being able to download and store and easily carry the music and photos has been great!  i would recommend this product even to people who are techno-phobic, because it is virtually plug and play.  apple makes products that think for you- which is great if you aren't so comfortable with technology.

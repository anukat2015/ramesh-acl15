Title: Jury still out
Content:
I just received my kiwi (love the color!) machine and set about to prime it.  I learned after calling the Salton support line that the priming process does not empty the whole container...  just as much as the particular machine "needs."  
I also learned much to my dismay that *my* machine only produces just barely 7 ounces on the 8 ounce setting.  I tried it several times, putting my pyrex measuring cup under the spot.    This may be a deal breaker, I can't decide...  We are used to BIG mugs full of coffee; even 8 ounces looks small to me.  The guy on the phone said this is normal and there is nothing I can do about it. (Well, I could RETURN it.) It is just the way the machine is calibrated at the factory...  ( You mean "incorrectly?")
I have only made the tea so far as I had already had all my coffee for the day when the box arrived.  I will taste my first coffee in the morning and discuss this dilemma with my DH.  He might hate it  -  too noisy, small cups,  can't use just any coffee....  
I spent SO much time agonizing over whether to get this machine or the Senseo or just a normal coffeemaker and now I am just ANNOYED over having to waste anymore of my more and more congested brain capacity to decide whether I will be able to like this machine or not.  
I was so READY to love it....

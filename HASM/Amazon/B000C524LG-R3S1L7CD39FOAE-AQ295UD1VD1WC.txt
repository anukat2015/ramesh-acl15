Title: Big disappointment!
Content:
I usually trust any Japanese manufacturers, however this is certainly not made in Japan.  As a fact, Hoover or so has the exact same product.  
This vacuum cleaner makes such a loud noise that is intolerable.  It has shorter cord than the discription.  
On board tools, one-botton cord rewind, powerhead brush with strong suction, and other features are plus.  Only and the biggest drawback is the noise!  
I wish that I could have tried this product somewhere as a floor model before purchased; then I would have noticed the intolerable noise. 
I would not recommend it to anybody especially who has babies or young kids in the family.  It will bother their ears...

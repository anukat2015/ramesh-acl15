Title: THIS MACHINE TRULY LIVES UP TO IT NAME "PRO"
Content:
I PURCHASED 15" MACBOOK PRO After MUCH THOUGHT AND RESEARCH.  I HAVE BEEN A PC user for 15 years so
I was skeptical that MACS were all my coworkers made them out to be.  Well I received my Macbook Pro three days after placing my order with Amazon  and I could not be happier.  Setup was a breeze, including the wireless interenet.  I was emailing and loading and editing pictures in no time.  The Apple support staff
are  knowlegeable and a pleassure to deal with.  I should have made the switch years ago.
I am also pleased with Amazon's fast delivery and you cannot beat their price.  The notebook was packaged
securely and I have no complaints.  I am very pleased.

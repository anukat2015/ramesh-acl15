Title: High Cost, Low Return
Content:
This is quite possibly the most over-hyped brand of vacuum cleaners out there. I have had this model for a bit over two years. Mostly it has just sat in the closet which is where I can attest to its having a worthy design for compactness. My cleaning lady hates it and prefers to use just a damp mop on all of the floors. I can understand her reasoning. Just to get it out of the closet, unfurl hoses, detach and extend wands is so time consuming. After you get it set up and ready to use, it offers no better than average suction, and the rotating brush head is absurdly designed as indicated in so many other reviews.  If it so much as taps a piece of furniture or woodwork, the rotating brushes disengage and you must bend down and tug at this poorly designed "knob". 
The machine, while sleek looking, still manages to tip over and get snagged on corners of furniture with alarming frequency.
So after two years, and having been used probably less than 15 times, it has broken off one polycarbonate piece which secures the lid to the dust bin. Dyson will sell me the part for 39.99. Not just the part I actually need, but the entire assembly.  Just today, my cleaning lady having it off, I hauled out the Dyson to vacuum up after Thanksgiving lunch, all was well until I went to retract the power cord.  Now that is broken. I've found the assembly for sale on Sears Parts website, over $50.00.
On top of it all, this vacuum is screwed together with some odd unconventional type of screws that one must buy special tools to work on. 
Save your money, buy a Hoover.

Title: Nice...BUT
Content:
The primary reason I bought this was to be able to set a temperature, and forget about the heater until spring.  This was not possible.  I set the temperature to 75 degree (on the auto/high setting.  The unit kicked on and the temp in the room started to rise.  Awesome.  Started at 68 degrees.  69. 70. 71. 72. 73. 74.  75...it'll probably shot off now, right?  Wrong.  76...I'm thinking "Ok maybe it goes a degree or two over to keep the fluctuation in temp right around the temp I set.  No big deal."  77. 78. 79. 80.....93 degrees.  Uhm yeah...some "auto" feature.

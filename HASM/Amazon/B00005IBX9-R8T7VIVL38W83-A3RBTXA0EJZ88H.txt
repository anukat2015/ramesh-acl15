Title: Great brand
Content:
This is my second Cuisinart coffee maker. There was nothing wrong with my other one besides after having it for 6 years it beeped periodically through the brewing cycle. I wanted an upgraded Cuisinart. I am very happy with this maker. The only thing I am not fond of is having to look into the water reservoir to see what your filling it up to. Other than that, it works beautifully.

Title: I love this vaccum cleaner
Content:
I  grew up with upright vaccum cleaners and when mine broke down, I borrowed an electrolux harmony from my friend.  I loved the ease and the light weight of the canister.  I ordered the Oxygen instead because I wanted more power....I got it!  This vaccum has great power.  The self propelled motor in the head is great.  The bags are a little small, but I love not having to dust after I vaccum.  The attachments make changing surfaces and attachments easy.  Highly recommend this product.

Title: 1 k cup = 1/2 cup of coffee !!
Content:
Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing SystemI really like this coffee maker.I am a die hard DD fan and figured this would save me money.It really doesnt because k cups are hard to find in stores and if you do , there is not a lot of variety.1 k cup only puts out a half of a coffee mug and if you press large cup it comes out too weak.prices range from 9.99 a box and up for 18-20 k cups.I have not tried the tea but I think the k cup cocoa is bad.I just use the hot water to make cocoa.It also uses a lot of water.I also think it uses a lot of electricity as my lights flicker when it going.It makes  a lot of noise.

Title: Great SLR
Content:
This is a great SLR  in the Nikon tradition.  Fast and with a superb quality of pictures will leave the owner extremelly pleased. The quality of body and construction is great and it benefit from a large selection of lens.
THe menu is a bit complicated and the preview window is small but they by no means take away from the quality of this camera.  Once you get to know the menu and all of the capabilities you will do wonders with this camera.

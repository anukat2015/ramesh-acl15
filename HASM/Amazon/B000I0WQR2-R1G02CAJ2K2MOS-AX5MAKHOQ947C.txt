Title: THE best space heater for RVing!
Content:
I was on the hunt to find a space heater that could deliver everything I needed and I found it in this one! It works like a convection oven heating the room evenly and quickly. It took the room up 10 degrees in a half hour, I turned the thermostat down until it clicked off (as per instructions) and it kept the room at my desired temp all night. And most importantly it IS completely silent! wow, what a score- for me that's a deal breaker! I use it in my all season RV, where outside temp really plays a part in our inside comfort and this heater has kept us completely warm and cozzy. It is super light weight (maybe 2 lbs) and easy to wheel around to wherever it's most needed. It never gets hot to the touch, which is important around my 6-year-old. This heater is a perfect score in my book!

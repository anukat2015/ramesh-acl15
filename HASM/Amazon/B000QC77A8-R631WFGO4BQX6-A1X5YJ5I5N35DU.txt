Title: Almost Great for a Large Room
Content:
Summary: If you have a large room with 8' - 9' ceilings this would probably be an ideal unit.
The pros:
* Ceramic heater with fan - gets the heat going quickly. 
* Thermostat with timer - nice feature not found in many heaters.
* Neutral color fits in with most decor.
* Allows you to lower the thermostat
The cons:
* No tip over shut off safety.
* Big amperage draw. Can't run the vacuum and heater at same time.
Like several other reviewers we were looking to heat a large space to supplement a not so efficient heat pump. This looked like an ideal unit. It's a good unit and will heat but, I think our ~ 400 sq ft "great room" with vaulted ceilings might be a little beyond it's capabilities. It never reached the 75 degrees we set on a night near freezing. Reversing the ceiling fan helps with heat distribution. We like that it can be placed near a wall.

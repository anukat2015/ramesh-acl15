Title: It's Worth Having
Content:
I really like the new Nano. It couldn't get any smaller or human fingers wouldn't be able to push the buttons. All the features are great. My only complaint is the confusion over the AV cable to watch your videos on a television. My old cable doesn't work and evidently you have to buy a new one from Apple which is VERY expensive. Other companies will most likely be selling cheaper cables in a few months, but I can't find one yet that is reasonably priced and that I know will work.

Title: Great all around camera
Content:
Even though I haven't taken the time to really read the manual on how to use this camera, just playing around with it, trying different settings, I have gotten some awesome shots. I would highly recommend it for people who want to get great shots of their children. 
We did a lot of comparison shopping. This camera is a really good price for the quality of the product.

Title: I'm still waiting for my W7 upgrade from Acer
Content:
It's an A+ for Amazon. Great shipping and delivery; very fast and carefully. Not the same from Acer, I'm still waiting for my W7 upgrade from Acer, It's been a month now and I haven't received any news of the order process. However, the computer is very good it meets the expectations for a netbook, except for battery life: it's a little less than advertised. Oh and the USB ports are a little tight and difficult to plug anything on it. Everything else is just fine.

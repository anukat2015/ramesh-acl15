Title: Good Heater
Content:
Over all, it is a good little heater.  It is Economical in terms gas usage, compact, lightweight, sturdy, heat output is moderate for a 14x14 room.  Use of the 1lb canisters are only worth it for emergencies or for camping in cold weather.  Otherwise attach a 20lbs gas tank and you are set for a few days.

Title: Go with the Dyson!!
Content:
This vaccuum worked great for the first 2-3 months, but now it won't pick up anything, even after repeatedly cleaning the filters, etc!  I find this so frustrating!! I tried this and the Dyson.  I liked the attachments for this vacuum and the ability to get into corners and tight places.  The Dyson was more difficult to manuever when using the attachments.  However, now I am wishing that I stuck with the Dyson!!  Don't make the same mistake I did by purchasing this vaccuum!!

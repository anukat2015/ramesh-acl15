Title: Good choice
Content:
We replaced my favorite 26-yr.old thermal coffee pot with this one, so it has taken a little adjusting, but we love it. We tried a Compresso for a week and returned it; too small and cool coffee. With the Zojirushi, the coffee is hot and stays hot and every pot has been great. (Now if I could just learn to pronounce it!)

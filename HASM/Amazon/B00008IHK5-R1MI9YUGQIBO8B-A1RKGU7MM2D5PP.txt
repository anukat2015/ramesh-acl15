Title: Great Coffee Brewer
Content:
Lasted Less than one week.  Amazon replaced it very quickly and the replacement is very good, no problems at all

This is our third Cuisinart Coffee Maker and the best one yet.  We will probably buy another one.  I like the Stainless better than the black.  Pouring water in, not a problem - use a funnel.  I am less than 5' tall and this works perfect for me.  The coffee is very good and we are particular.  Our Briel Espresso machine is in use often.
For any drips, put a tray under the machine, works perfect.
A great coffeemaker and I like all the little options, especially the 4 cup and under button.
We have bought many Cuisinart Factory Reconditioned and never a problem

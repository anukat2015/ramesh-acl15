Title: I Should Have Listened to the Negative Feedback!!!
Content:
My son wanted an MP3/Video player that wasn't an iPod, and had a large screen.  The Archos 605 seemed like a great choice.  My research revealed some positive reviews/feedback, and plenty of negative feedback and horror stories.  I wanted to believe the good reviews... but shouldn't have!  Within 48 hours of receiving the unit for Christmas, it had frozen.  We stepped through the recovery procedures on the screen, but nothing worked.  We returned it to Amazon.  Amazon handled the return extremely well.  Stay away from this product!!!

Title: What A Deal?
Content:
I love this Sansa it's great! I didn't think I would like it because it was so small but the fact that its small makes it so much better. It is really easy to use and transferring music to it is wonderful and easy. I really wanted to get an Ipod but it was so expensive but thank goodness I found this sansa because not only was it less expensive but it is better than an Ipod. When I get tired of listening to my music I can just flip to the fm tuner and listen to the radio.

Title: Works well, but could be better
Content:
Just got this vacuum from amazon.com and I have one word for it.  HEAVY.  The vacuum is big and bulky, HEAVY, does not have a crevice tool and does not vacuum around edges very well, such as under your kitchen cabinets or along baseboards.  It only took a few minutes to get together, but it's not my favorite vacuum cleaner I've had.  If I had bought it from a local retailer, I'd return it.  It does have a nice, lengthy cord (compared to my Dirt Devil) and has some nice tools for pet hair (rubber-edged ones).  I do like that the filters are not inside the dirt container like with my Dirt Devil.  Overall, it's an okay vacuum for the price I paid ($113) but I'm not thrilled.

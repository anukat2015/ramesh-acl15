Title: so so service
Content:
Overall we really liked the vac but we encountered a problem with the belt slipping the 2nd time we used it. I called Hoover Svc 800 number and was told they would send out free pack of belts and we should give those a try. I agreed that would be a good place to start but was not happy to here that even though its under factory warranty ( two days old ) Hoover service centers are all independents and sometimes charge to just look at the vac , should the belt not correct the problem. Just something to keep in mind for potential service problems. They stated any returns for new merchandise would have to be addressed with Amazon. The new belt seems to have corrected the problem for now. We will keep our fingers crossed as we really do like this vac.

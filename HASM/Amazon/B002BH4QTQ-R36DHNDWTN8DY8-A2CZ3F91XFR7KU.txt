Title: Great Laptop but it runs a little hot!!
Content:
This is a great Laptop, I purchased it for U$799 and comparing the features of this machine i think no other laptop can beat this. The design is great mainly inside the notebook.
To be honesty the first time that I turn it on I felt like the sun of Okinawa was clouded, it took more than a half hour to finish windows instalation. After start windows for couple times everything ran slow and I started to be concerned about the laptop performance. So, I formatted the computer and installed windows again. The drivers worked perfectly and now everything is running like a charm. The windows starts quickly, I can use photoshop, play a DVD and play games without performance penalty. I think this problem was caused by bad windows installation or because of the tons of HP softwares that comes with the laptop.     
The features are great, I mean HDMI, Bluetooth for an affordable price. The Keyboard is nice, but the arrows are too tight. The monitor is fanstastic, bright and vivid colors I liked it very much. The video card is powerful and allows a great game experience, much more than I expected, but it runs hot!!. I leave in Brazil and in the summer we have high temperatures such 34 or 36ºC and I'm thinking in spent some money in a good cooling solution fot this notebook.
Finally, I liked very much of this laptop and I think for this price it's a winner. But as it runs considerable hot I gave it 4 stars.

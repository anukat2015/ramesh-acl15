Title: Not bad for an inexpensive mp3 player
Content:
I own one of these gadgets except its color is solid black. I had actually purchased it in a local store about a year ago on sale for about $34.99. Thinking the price wasn't too bad, I snatched one up, especially since it was an 8GB player versus the 2-4GB players I usually see around that price.
I've had no major issues with this player. It hasn't crashed on me or anything of the sort. The only downsides I noticed are:
+ Although it can playback video, it's really hard to watch any on this device without having a much bigger screen.
+ It seems to me when I fully charge this player, the maximum battery life has been around 4 hours tops. It dies too soon on me, especially when I'm traveling.
All in all, I've been rather pleased with this mp3 player. However, if you're looking for something more durable, I would spend the extra few bucks to get a more top-notch mp3 player, but if you're like me and prefer something not too expensive, this little gem might be good for you.

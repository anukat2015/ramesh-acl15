Just bought today from a local Target store in CT. For what I need this unit is pin point dead on. I'm not a fan of apple products, but my wife has the 30gig 4th gen, and the iphone so.... You can see I have had my exp. with hers and itunes and etc... Now I have all my music ripped via media player 11 and this was one of the coolest and easist syncs I have ever seen. I have 29.7gb/7,570 files of music, and it took alittle time, but hey I rule for having the widest music selection on the block. In the car fm transmitter is right on. Need I saw more.... I could, but let the product do the talking. Want more info contact me on this device via www.myspace.com/zune

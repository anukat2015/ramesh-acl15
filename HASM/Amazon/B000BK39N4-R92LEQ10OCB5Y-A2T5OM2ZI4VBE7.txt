Title: excellent camera
Content:
I just upgraded from a point and shoot Sony DSC P8. Had a few thousand photos on my hard disk and then decided to upgrade to something more "pro".
After a lot of research finally decided to pickup the Evolt E500 with the dual lens kit.. and I should say I am rather impressed. 
The sharpness and depth of pictures are amazing. Very crisp, vibrant photos. The camera is much lighter than I expected., probably because of the plastic body. I am a techie myself so the menu and usability took me not more than a week to get used to. The anti-dust feature is cool and helps keep the sensor clean. 
A couple of (very minor) concerns:
AF on the 40-150 is a bit noisy, but I can live with it.
The 14-45 lens isnt anywhere close in quality to the 40-150, probably because the latter is a Japanese make. 
The lack of USB2.0 support was a concern initially, till I picked up a universal card reader, which took care of this problem.
Low light images are a bit noisy. 
If you are a point and shoot photographer and would like to upgrade to a "pro" or a 35mm user looking at converting to a DSLR, look no further!

Title: Nikon d50: everything I had hoped for in a digital slr.
Content:
In addition to the advantages of digital (the camera can hold 300 high quality photos) and the use of all lenses made for the Nikon slr is the very good quality of the pictures and the ease of handling in the non-auto mode.  You couldn't ask for more.

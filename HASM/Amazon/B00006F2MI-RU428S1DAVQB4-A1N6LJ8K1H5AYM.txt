Title: disappointing product
Content:
I have had nothing but trouble with this coffee maker. I put up with it for a year before finally giving up. The first problem I had with it was that all the water wouldn't run through the machine. I would have to turn it back on over and over again to get all the water through. Finally I discovered that if I hit the 1-4 cup button(even when I was brewing 10 cups)I could trick the machine into letting all the water go through. The next problem was that on occasion the basket would just pop out sometimes from the force of the ground coffee being shot through the grinder into the basket and sometimes it would just pop out randomly for no apparent reason. Grounds and coffee would leak all over the place. I could never tell when this would happen so I got into the habit of staying in the kitchen to babysit the machine every day as I was brewing coffee so that I could push the basket back in place if it popped out. This meant giving up the use of the timer rather than risk waking up to a big mess. When it got to the point that the basket popped out every single day and I had to hold the basket in place the whole time it was brewing, I gave up. I loved the idea of having a grinder and brewer together which is probably why I put up with this machine as long as I did. But having the grinder in the machine is messier to clean up because the moisture from brewing the coffee gets up in the grinder making it sludgy. I've come to the conclusion that it's easier to clean up a separate grinder and coffee maker. The carafe is nice and keeps the coffee warm for hours, but not hot. If you like your coffee very hot, you probably would be disappointed with the carafe.

Title: A true DSLR value
Content:
I researched affordable DSLR cameras and chose the A300 for its rear screen viewing when desired, its 'in the camera body' anti shake system, its comfortable shape and weight, and its excellent picture clarity. The A300 is NOT a 'dumbed down' DSLR. Its sophisticated (yet easy to use)features should satisfy any photographer. Controls are perfectly positioned, settings are easily reviewed, delay time between pressing the shutter release and the picture being taken IS NON EXISTANT. Audio noise is unobtrusive. Bracketing is simply achieved. and the kit lens is fine for general use. As I take Nature photos, I opted for the Tamron 70-300mm zoom lens as a quality yet less expensive alternative to the Sony zoom. I would buy the Sony A300 again without hesitation. [Nevertheless, if you have an extra $400, the new 350 is an impressive choice indeed.]

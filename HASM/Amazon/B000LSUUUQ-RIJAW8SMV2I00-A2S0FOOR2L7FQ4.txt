Title: Great heater, short longevity
Content:
I bought this heater early January when we went through some cold weather in Miami. I was very pleased with the way the heater was heating up my bedroom (about 12x12). You can set the heater at the temperature that is comfortable to you (note that there are no precise thermostats that allows you to set your room at a specific temperature, but just a comfort thermostat that works just fine). it generates a lot of heat in a short period of time and woks wonder.
My only issue is that it stopped functioning after only a month. I may have bought a bad one. I called Holmes, gave the serial number and promptly sent me a new one by UPS.
I was very pleased with their customer service and I just hope this one will last longer.

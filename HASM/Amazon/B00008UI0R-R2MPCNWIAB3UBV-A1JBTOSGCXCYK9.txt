Title: Does its job
Content:
I've had the unit for almost 2 years and it runs like the day I took it out of the box.  I replaced an Electolux that I paid $350 USED.  This beats the Electrolux all to heck.  It's also fun to use.  My 17 year old teenager actually volunteers to vacuum!  It's the best value for the money I have seen in a vacuum cleaner.  I give it five stars, HOWEVER nothing is perfect.  The HEPA technology makes the house smell fresh after vacuuming but the dust bin needs to be emptied and the filter brushed and cleaned very often.  Second, some of the attachments don't ride along on the unit and so they get misplaced (in my household) all the time.  Those are the only things I think Hoover should change.

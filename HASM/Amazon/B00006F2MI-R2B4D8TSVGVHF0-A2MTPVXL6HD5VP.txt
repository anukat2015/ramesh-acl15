Title: Better than previous non-thermal models
Content:
Even after reading the reviews, I purchased this item to replace a Cuisinart Brew & Grind that I have had for several years, for which I lost a part. It was starting to leak anyway, so I thought I would get a stainless steel model to match the rest of the kitchen. This is actually my 3rd Grind and Brew in 13 years.
1) It matches quite nicely and is easy to clean. The stainless steel does not appear to transfer fingerprints and smudges as readily as some stainless steel.
2) It seems quieter than the previous model, but I expect grinding to be noisy so this is not an issue for me.
3) Coffee heat is an issue...you really do have to prewarm the thermal carafe. But what annoyes me most is that the burner turns off almost immediately after the coffee has stopped brewing. I'm not sure why they removed the ability to time how long the burner stays on. With my non-thermal model, I had a choice of the burner staying on from 2 to 4 hours. I imagine it has something to do with the carafe itself, but it would help if the burner were allowed to heat the coffee to a higher temperature.
4) The coffee does pour out very slowly and if you release the lid to get it to pour more quickly, the coffee left in the pot cools more quickly. 
But the unit looks nice, the grinder works well and the coffee tastes good so, for $75(after rebate) I am pleased with my purchase.

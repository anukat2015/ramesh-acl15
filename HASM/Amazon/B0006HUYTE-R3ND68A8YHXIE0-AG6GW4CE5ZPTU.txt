Title: Very good little machine
Content:
So far (about 1 month) like it very much. It is powerful and works well on my hardwood floors as well as the rugs. Decent job on carpets too. It is very lightweight and easy to move around the house. On the negative side, the idea of putting the electrical cord on the bottom of the cleaner combined with the idea of attaching the tools to the rear is somewhat awkward and is not very convenient. All in all very good.

Title: Cute little heater
Content:
I bought this little heater for a new sunroom addition we added to our house to use when it is really cold.  It does a great job & looks good too.  It is lighweight enough that I have also moved it around to heat other parts of the house when they are cold. It wouldn't be good as your only heat, but for the size & the money it does a great job. It does not get hot on top or the sides, which I like because I have 8 cats. There is a cheaper model without the fan, but I would not recommend it. The fan makes a big difference, although it dosen't blow out that much heat..but some. Delivered quickly & ready to plug in.

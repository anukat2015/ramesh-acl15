Title: Much better than expected.
Content:
I'm sixteen and have an iPod Video of my own that I enjoy more than any other electronic I own. When I was searching for a cheap mp3 player for my mother on Christmas, I came across this. It's cheap and perfect for the price. The sound clarity is much better than expected, and it holds around 250 songs which is more than enough for most that I know. I highly recommend this product, much better than the first generation =]

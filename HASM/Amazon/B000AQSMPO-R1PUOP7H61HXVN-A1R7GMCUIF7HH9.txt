Title: It Works, And the Coffee's Good
Content:
Have tried five different coffee blends in the Keurig system and find the coffee that's delivered to be hot, fresh and delicious.  The convenience and lack of waste are big selling factors for me. I use my regular brewer in the morning and the Keurig for later in the day when one cup is just what I need.

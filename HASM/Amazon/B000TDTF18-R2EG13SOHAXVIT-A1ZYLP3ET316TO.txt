Title: not so hot, very slow
Content:
We have this coffee maker in the student lounge at school. It is convenient to fill both coffee filter and with water but even without the aroma button on, it takes a very long time (longer than students have) to complete a brew cycle. The coffee isn't as hot as other coffee makers I have experience with either. No problem with any leaks.

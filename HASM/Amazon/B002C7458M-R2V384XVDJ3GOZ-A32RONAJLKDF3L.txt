Title: Fabulous!
Content:
Having used and loved Macs since 1987, this is a biased review. The screen is bright and sharp, the construction of the case is gorgeous. The backlit keyboard looks great, and the multi-touch trackpad is a pleasure to use. It's also significantly faster than my 2 year-old iMac. I love this new laptop.

Title: House husband loves this vacuum (and All Vacuum Depot-Irvine!)
Content:
Did a lot of research on several models, mostly avoiding Miele due to the high cost. Amazon has a great price and of course good service and return policy, but I went with All Vacuum Depot in Irvine, CA for this Neptune model because they gave me a great deal and 3 extra warranty years on top of Miele's already excellent coverage. Sean and Jason could not have been more helpful.

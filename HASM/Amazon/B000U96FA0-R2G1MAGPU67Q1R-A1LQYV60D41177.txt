Title: Keeps the room nice and warm....
Content:
I love this heater. 
It really does a good job keeping the bedroom warm. Sometimes I'll wake up and it'll be too hot that I have to turn it off... did I tell you that it comes with a remote control???? 
It's a great thing to have by the night table especially when you wake up in the middle of the night and don't feel like getting out of bed to shut it off. 
I also love the fact that you can adjust the temperature to what you want and also how many hours you want it on for. 
It's a excellent heater to have It's especially great for those of you who have Landlords that are too cheap to give you heat.

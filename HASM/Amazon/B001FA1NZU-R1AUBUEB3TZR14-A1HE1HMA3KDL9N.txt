Title: Breakthrough in pocket computing
Content:
The IPod Touch is a genuine computer, and I am using it as such. I use it for mathematics, astronomy, research of new ideas, a book reader, e-mail, study of weather patterns, study of fractals, and, oh yes, music on Pandora. I have not used it for You Tube (much),
Facebook or Twitter, although it works well for those things. I plan to use it with Skype as soon as I get my microphone.
The stand alone apps, especially SpaceTime 4.0 and SkyGazer are marvelous. SpaceTime is advanced mathematical software, comparable in power to Mathematica, Derive, or Maxima. It renders exceptional three dimensional graphs.
I enjoy listening to Minnesota Public Radio with their free app. And I forgot to mention how easy it is to follow sports with free apps- especially from MLB and PGA. Free apps from Google and Wikipedia make using these features on a small screen easy. Google Earth is a remarkable free app.
This device is a technological marvel- a genuine breakthrough. I do have some minor concerns, however.
I bought what I thought was the most recent version, and within a week I had to upgrade at a cost of 10.00 to version 3.0.
Upgrades like this should be free. Also, I spent 7.50 to get a simple recharger which plugs into household outlets. They cost 30.00
at the Apple store, but should be part of the package. And finally, I bought my unit in August. In early September, the price dropped by
nearly 40.00. I have no idea where to look for a refund of this difference.
But none of these complaints diminish the quality of the product, and my enjoyment of it. I encourage you to get one!

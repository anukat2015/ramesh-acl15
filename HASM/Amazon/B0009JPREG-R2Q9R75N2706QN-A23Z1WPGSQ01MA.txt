Title: Nikon D70s
Content:
What can I say - it's a Nikon! I've been using the coolpix series for the past few years but miss the ability to zoom and focus the lens myself by twisting the lens barrel. This camera has more rave revues than others I looked at and, so far, has lived up to all of them.

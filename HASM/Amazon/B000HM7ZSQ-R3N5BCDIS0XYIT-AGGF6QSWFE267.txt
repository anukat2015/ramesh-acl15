Title: Money well spent!
Content:
This fan is great and very sturdy- kicks up as strong a breeze as you need!  
Totally keeps the bugs away and you nice and cool, even on the hottest days.
My husband also uses it when he is smoking ribs.  Puts it on low and turns it toward the smoker- keeps the embers going very nicely!!  My husband laughed when I brought this home- now he thanks me for making a great purchase!!

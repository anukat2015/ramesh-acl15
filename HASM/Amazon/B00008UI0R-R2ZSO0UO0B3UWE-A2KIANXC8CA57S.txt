Title: Fragile Plastic Parts
Content:
I have owned this vacuum cleaner for 13 months (one month out of warranty) and it has worked really well. I haven't had any of the issues mentioned by other reviewers; however, today the plastic "quick disconnect foot pedal" on the Windtunnel Powered Nozzle broke. This is the mechanism that is used to release the powered nozzle from the extension wand. On close examination, after unscrewing the broken part from the unit, it was clear that this part was engineered for failure -- an ABS plastic tongue is flexed by the release switch every time it is pressed. ABS plastic is not flexible and the stress of the movement caused it to fatigue and inevitably snap off. This part should have been manufactured with a flexible, metal release mechanism. Cost cutting design decisions like this are what make so many appliances today disposable, when they should really last for years. Don't buy Hoover products -- this company is clearly more motivated about saving a few pennies on each part than keeping broken (one year old) appliances out of landfills.

Title: not worth it
Content:
I bought this product to condition the downstairs master bedroom at night so I did not have to cool the whole first floor. This product is quite loud. You can sleep through it, but it is more than just white noise.  It is louder than a box fan on high. You will have to modify it to make it work well.  The other reviews that mention foam board or some other insulator around the window vent are absolutely correct.  It is also a good idea to wrap the air tube with insulation.  The water reservoir fills very quickly in a room that already has conditioned air (filled in less than four hours in Houston). At that point I felt it just was not worth it.

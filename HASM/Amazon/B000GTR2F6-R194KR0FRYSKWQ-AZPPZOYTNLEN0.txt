Title: You will fall in love with this unit!
Content:
I bought this as a gift for my husband.  And we use this Keurig Platinum coffee maker at least 6 times a day.  It is amazing and I'm being very truthful.  The Keurig customer service department is very friendly as well.  Our Keurig started acting up and we called the 800 # a few times.  After trying to fix the problem, Keurig sent us out a brand new unit.  We had to send them a part from our original Keurig, but we were impressed.  I will note--don't ever put the water reservoir lid in the dish washer.  I did and now it won't fit.  It says on the lid not to put it in the washer, but being hasty--I did anyway.  I don't think we could ever go back to a regular maker again.  Now we don't have to throw out half a pot of coffee.  We make what we want and that's it.  We can each make our favorite K-Cup coffee too.

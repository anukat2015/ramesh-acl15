Title: life saver
Content:
I have all wood and tile floors . 
Couple of dogs lots of people who don't wipe their feet.
This vaculm is great very strong suction picks up everything .
Pet attachment is great on furniture.
I use it twice a week.
Cuts cleaning time down to half the time it use to take. 
It gets all the doq hair..
Great item also light weight to take up and down the stairs..
The vaculm parts very sturdy..I expect it to last a long time..

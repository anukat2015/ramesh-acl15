Title: effective cleaner
Content:
have had this vacuum for about a month and it has performed well so far.  there was a glitch at first.  the motorized brush device was not working and upon inspection the belt that drives the brush was not in place.  I put it in place and now works properly.  I like the smaller size of the canister as well as the handle position for picking it up.  it's helpful that the motorized brush can go under the bed for cleaning there.  could not do that with an upright.  I like the bag-less feature and that you can see into the canister how much dirt and such is there and determine whether to empty it or not.  no guessing involved.  in all I am please with this item.  if it lasts I will be very pleased.

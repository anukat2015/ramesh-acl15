Title: Excellent supplemental heat
Content:
This heater is by far the best "supplemental" room heater we have owned. We've had them all from radiating floor models, an expensive tower fan model and for the past several years an oil-filled radiator which we would have kept had the internal wiring not fried (not a good feeling when your bedroom heater goes up in smoke). 
I emphasize "suplemental" as you may be disappointed if you expect to heat a room with this heater alone, but we love it in our bedroom. It's very quiet, generates heat almost instantly and it's stylish. We mounted ours on the wall and it's very unobtrusive, it just doesn't get in the way like so many others tend to do. Highly recommended, and if you shop right you can find it with a 2 year extended warranty for about $10.00.
Oh, and for those even slightly worried about that "impossible to remove label," I had no problems. Here's the trick for removing gummy residue from labels. Spray a little WD-40 on a paper towel and wipe, repeat if needed. Then spray some kitchen cleaner on another paper towel, wipe off the oily residue and you're done!

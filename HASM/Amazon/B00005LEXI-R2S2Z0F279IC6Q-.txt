Title: deleted due to stupidity
Content:
I'm deleting my wrongheaded and misinforming review based on research of catalytic...not radiant propane heaters. Serious safety issues surround the use of propane RADIANT heaters by campers. Issues include CO POISONING, radiant heating of combustible materials and asphyxiation.
www.carbonmonoxidedeaths.com should be consulted when purchasing a radiant camp heater.

Title: It's okay but not as great as some reviews would have you believe
Content:
I was torn between giving this a 3 star or a 4 star review and I decided to be generous and give it 4 stars because I think the heater basically performs the way the box says it will.  The problem is that I put too much weight into these 5 star reviews that had me believing that this was going to be the best purchase of my life.  I don't know how anyone can say they heat their whole house with one or two of these heaters.  I don't see that happening unless you live in a warm climate and your "cold" weather is only around 50 degrees.  It's an okay heater but I'm not nearly as happy as some of these other reviewees are.

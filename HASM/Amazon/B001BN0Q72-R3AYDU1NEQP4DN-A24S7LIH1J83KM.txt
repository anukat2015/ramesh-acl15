Title: Way Overrated
Content:
This laptop suffers from several expected and unexpected (features).  First, it costs about twice what it should, compared to its competition.  There is only one widescreen screen resolution available, anything else is just distortion.  Don't buy this unless you have young eyes or expect to wear maginfying glass spectacles. Surprisingly, there is a lot of plastic in this case - they want you to believe its all metal but the bottom is plastic and quite flimsy. Sony has loaded it with a ton of useless software. Vista uses 1 gig of ram to start up - don't think of ordering this with less than 2 gigs.  Ah, Vista, its really too bad that you can't get this laptop with XP as Vista is the most bloated piece of junk Microsoft has ever designed.  My company is still able to order Lenovo laptops with XP and will, until absolutely forced to go to Vista.

Title: Works Well For Us!
Content:
I have an elderly family member with a lower-circulatory problem and limited mobility, so we needed something to heat localized areas of the house to keep her comfortable.  This space heater remote controlled, adjustable thermostat filled the requirements perfectly.  Unlike other reviewers, I have no problem with the fan noise -- it's a small unit and has to "blow" the air -- not terribly loud, but noticeable, definitely not a deterrent for us.  The added safety feature (turns off when tipped over) works and has saved us from a couple of mishaps (inadvertent bumps with the wheelchair).  It works well in relatively small spaces, heats in seconds, and has proven to be very reliable so far.  I'm considering one for the home office (for use in the cooler mornings/evenings).

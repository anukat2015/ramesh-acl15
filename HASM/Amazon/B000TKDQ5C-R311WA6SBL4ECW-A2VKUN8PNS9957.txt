Title: Does what it says
Content:
I bought this to save a little on my energy bill. For the amount I paid, it certainly does what it claims to do.  You can feel the heat as it radiates on you - kind of like bringing your face level with a hot oven. It won't warm up the whole room by any means, but the small size ensures it will fit in virtually any space, and generate quite a bit of heat within the direct vicinity.  You do need to have it a few feet away from you, for best results. It's also a bit noisy, but not noisier than a fan.  Personally, I don't mind the noise. Not sure yet about the savings on electricity, but if they amount to anything significant, I'll likely end up buying another one of these.

Title: Works fine so far!!
Content:
Apparently people have had some problems with this machine. Let me say that I had a head start because of all the great reviews on Amazon. I was well aware of the potential overflow problem and other minor problems which almost made me pass up purchasing it. Well I absolutely made the right decision to buy this little miracle device. Besides, how could I possibly lose when I got it for just $...from Amazon's friday sale. Thats half of the original price. Now I agree that the plastic might be a little cheap, but if you're careful not to abuse it I dont see why it shouldn't last a few years as long as the electrical internals keep their integrity. All it really does is boil water and suck it through a filter. However it does this really well and really fast. I've only had it for a week but my expectations have been met and exceeded. I use the attractive supplied mug to measure my water to add to the reservoir, add two teaspoons of my choice coffee to the filter basket, push a button, and walla! a cup of coffee in a little over two minutes. I mean its litterally done before you can use the bathroom. If you place your sugar/creme in the mug and close the lid, you can brew coffee right through the lid and end up with a cup of coffee to go, sealed and all. I just shake the cup to stir and everything's fine. Not one overflow or any other problem yet, rather a decent cup of coffee, fast. I haven't had any plastic flavor problems with the mug either. Now because this thing is so fast you can boil water for tea or anything else in under three minutes. Much faster than a kettle or microwave. Must be seen to be appreciated. Very convenient. Now the only test left is the test of time.

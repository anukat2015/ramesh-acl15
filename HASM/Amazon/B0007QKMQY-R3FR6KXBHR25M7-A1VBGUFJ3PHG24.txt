Title: I love it
Content:
My husband bought this camera for me for Christmas mostly I wanted to expand from my point and shoot camera.... I have taken about 200 pictures with this camera and it is amazing... It catches great details of my very active 4 year old....even with the kit lens my pictures are amazing!

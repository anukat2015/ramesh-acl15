Title: Best Laptop I've owned, best that I've seen anyone own.
Content:
Short and sweet, this laptop kicks @$$!!!  For the price, you go so much included in this bad boy:  Blu-ray player/burner, [...] video with 1GB dedicated RAM, 16+ in screen, 4GB RAM upgradable to 8GB, decent sized hard drive, I mean the list goes on.  Just look at the description and you see what you get.  I think for 1000 dollars this computer is well worth it.  One bonus, don't know for how long, but if you buy now you should get a free upgrade for Windows 7 when it is released.  If you haven't already heard, it is getting great reviews.  So if you don't like Vista, you can hold out for 7 when it gets released in the fall.  If you are looking for a laptop, look no further than this Sony Vaio.  You will love it.

Title: works very nicely for us
Content:
compared to a few more box type ceramic heaters, this works very well and has held up, so far, for a few years of use.  we use it in our kitchen/den space which is about 35 x 15 feet and as long as the room is closed in, it heats quickly and keeps things nice and toasty.  we rarely use the timer or the different power options (I think it's 1500 and 700 watts). The oscillator does a good job of distributing the heat.  I'm thinking of putting one in a few other rooms.  The only other thing I'd like (that this doesn't have) is one that kicks out the same amount of heat, same features, without the sound of the fan.  Don't know if they exist.  This one's not too noisy (again compared to a few others I have).

Title: eco-heater - a great product
Content:
I bought one eco-heater for my mother's TV room - she is 84 and always cold - the heater keeps her toasty warm and uses a lot less electricity.  So I bought two more - one for the kitchen and one for her bedroom.  The electric baseboard heaters almost never come on anymore and the rooms are always warm enough for my mother. The only baseboard heaters we do use are in the two bathrooms.  I believe we will save at least $100.00 a month on the power bill - if not more - will let you know later.

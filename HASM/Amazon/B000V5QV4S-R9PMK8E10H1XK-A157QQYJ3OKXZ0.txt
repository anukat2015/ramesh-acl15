Title: Love it
Content:
I have the 20D that I use for wedding photography, and was looking for a 2nd body for a backup. I chose the 40D for 10.1MP and the larger viewfinder. I also was unimpressed with the 5D reviews. I have to say that I really like the 40D. It is quick, the buffer is large, and the addition of creative zones are a big improvement. The price couldn't be better for a  2nd unit, and now my 20D is getting some much needed rest :-)
I have shot over 2000 shots with no issues. I normally shoot in Aperture Priority or Time Priority settings for the most versatility.

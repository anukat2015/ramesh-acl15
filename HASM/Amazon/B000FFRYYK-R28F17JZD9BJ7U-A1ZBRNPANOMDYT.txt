Title: Bunn Canister
Content:
I regret waiting so long to buy a Bunn Coffee Maker. It truly does make a full pot of coffee in 3 minutes, and I can't
believe how long the stainless steel canister keeps the coffee hot. This is the nicest looking unit that Bunn has ever
made. Everything about the canister is great, and there have been no problems with leaking or dripping around the spout.

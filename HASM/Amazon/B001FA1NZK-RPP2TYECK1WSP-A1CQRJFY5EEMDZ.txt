Title: Disgusted with the product
Content:
I think Apple should be ashamed to put such an expensive product on the market with a set of instructions on a slip of paper that is about half the size of a 8.5 x 11 sheet. I would be less offended by this deficiency if the instructions included the information I need to get the thing running.
I understand that I am expected to seek help from the various phone and web sites listed on the "instruction" sheet. Some day when my blood pressure has settled down I will explore those resouces and will probably find that the starting and use of it is a simple matter and probably much as advertized. Maybe some well meaning teen ager will drop by and get me started, but in the meantime I shall say every bad thing about Apple that I can think of to anyone I can corner and force to listen to me.

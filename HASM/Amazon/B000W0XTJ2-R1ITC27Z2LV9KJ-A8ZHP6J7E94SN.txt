Title: Great pc, great size, low batery life, only available with vista.
Content:
I am going from a Pentium 4 with 512 ram memory to a AMD Turion 64 x 2 with 2gb ram memory, and with windows vista my old pc runs faster. That's not HP`s fault but they should give the option to buy this pc with XP windows.
This notebook has a great size, its very portable, the battery sticks out from the back but its note really a problem.
The screen is very reflective, when you are using it outside you have to put the higher brightness in the screen.
The battery has a VERY short live, but there are some old tricks to extend it a little more, just charge it to 100% take it out and use the power source, once a week use the battery till it runs off and then charge it again to 100%. After a few times you do this, the battery should last aprox 1 hour more than normal.. good thing when it lasts only 2 hours.
Finally this is a great Notebook, the touch screen feature works nice after you configure it, it still runs fast for working with vista, it brings a lot of nice software installed by HP, it has a really good money/value perspective.  
I'm keeping it, and if I had to, I would buy it again.

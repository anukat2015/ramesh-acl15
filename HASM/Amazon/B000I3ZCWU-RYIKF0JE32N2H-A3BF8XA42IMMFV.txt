Title: Rebel XTi-- do you really need a cause?
Content:
Great camera... easy to use, and the menu setup is designed for quick changes on the fly. This is key when shooting-- you don't want to have to scroll through menu after submenu to get to the setting  you want to change. Olympus, I'm lookin' at you.
One thing to keep in mind: the APS-C sensor size results in an effective focal length of 1.6x whatever the lens says. For instance, a 50mm lens becomes an 80mm lens on this camera body. 
That having been said, any of Canon's EF or EF-S lenses will work on the Rebel body. Keep your old glass!

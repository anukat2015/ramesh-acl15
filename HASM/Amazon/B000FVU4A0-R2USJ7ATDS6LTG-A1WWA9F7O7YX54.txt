Title: Great looks BUT critical flaw
Content:
I was really excited about this coffee maker in large part because of its design with the removable water tank. All around the coffee maker looks sharp.
However, I was disappointed rather quickly as the machine makes very weak coffee. I read through some other reviews on this site and others and apparently it's not a unique problem with my machine. Even after using the "Flavor+" button, I had weak coffee despite using two heaping tablespoons per six ounces of water. For some of you, maybe using the "Flavor+" button with large amounts of ground will be fine, but that's your risk to take. Without using the "Flavor+" button you might as well be drinking water!!!

Title: Doesn't work on carpet
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner after a lot of research.  I was soon very disappointed.  It worked great the first time I used, but the second time I used it the belt kept coming off.  My husband fixed it once, but it kept slipping off.  He said it looked like a design flaw.  I had remembered reading other bad reviews about the belt, but decided to try it anyway because there were also a lot of good reviews.  I have been trying to return it for over a week and having major problems with amazon.com.  I've always liked the customer service in the past, but this time I'm having a hard time returning the item that it makes me not want to buy anything else with them.  Save you money and buy a different vacuum cleaner, or if you do buy this one don't buy it from amazon.com get it from someplace you can return it to easily if it breaks.

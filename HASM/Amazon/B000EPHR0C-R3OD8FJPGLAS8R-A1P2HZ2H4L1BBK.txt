Title: FIX THIS DEVICE!
Content:
Want to buy this new one, as my old one is crapping out, (the central "select" button is wearing out), but cannot quite bring myself to part with the money.  Should my $300+ device be worn out in a year?  And what about the battery that is not really replaceable and is too small, and the problems with iTunes?
I was looking for an improvement in the new iPods, not just refinements in the size!  iTunes does not work well.  It garbles information, esp when downloading cds, but sometimes at random, and now refuses to play whenever another program is running.  The battery needs to be a rechargeable/renewable.  It could just as easily take AA batteries, or a clip type battery like old cell phones?  How about making the unit compatable with other providers?
If Apple is determined to have it all; service, hardware,operating system, consumer sales, then it had better get it's act together.  It's not enough to just show up.

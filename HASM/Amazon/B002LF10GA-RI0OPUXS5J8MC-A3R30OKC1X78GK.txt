Title: Great little book, but quality is hit or miss
Content:
I got so I could be more mobile during the holidays. It arrived and wouldnt work off the battery, as soon as you unplugged it even when it said the battery was 100% charged, it would die. Still waiting to see how amazon handles the situation because ACER has poor support and the idea of shipping the laptop to Acer to get fixed means I wont have it back till January....the eyes on you amazon.
I have it three stars because this negatively influenced my experience with the unit. It is very much a great little unit, the full size key board, the sleek touch pad, its feature filled (minus the BlueTooth) with the camer, HD screen and card reader. I also noticed a sim card slot in the back but i think thats available on a different variation of this model.
If you want something that will get you through the day at a solid price this is a good bet, but be prepared that you may be one of the unlucky ones like myself. 
I'll keep you updated on this battery / logic board fiasco.

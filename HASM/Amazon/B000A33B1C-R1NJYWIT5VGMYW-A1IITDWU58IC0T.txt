Title: Disappointing
Content:
This radiator was a big disappointment. Even if my heater is on lowest setting both of the red lights come on, indicating that it is on the highest setting. Analog thermostat has no indication of what temperature I have set it on. 96 settings are tiny 96 pins that are needed to moved to set on and off periods (you can move many at a time though). However, cannot set different on and off periods for weekend. Even when it is off, it makes a little periodic noise --- like a clock which is disconcerting at the least.

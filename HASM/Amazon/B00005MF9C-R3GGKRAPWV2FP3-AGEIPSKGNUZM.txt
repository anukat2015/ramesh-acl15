Title: Quick and convenient machine
Content:
I bought this about 8 months ago - its just what I needed in in a single coffee drinker household. It brews my daily cup well and my favorite part is that it is really convenient to clean. I use a paper filter - Melitta # 1 filters ( also sold on amazon) fit this machine perfectly and make it even easier to maintain.

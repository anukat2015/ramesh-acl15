Title: great for pet hair...very satisfied
Content:
I've had this vacuum for about a month now and think it's great.  The pink pet hair attachment is amazing at picking up hair from anything!  The vacuum did start making a small clicking noise only after a couple of uses, but this does not seem to have altered its performance.  One thing I dislike is that when you remove the hose to use the attachments, a little bit of dust and dirt often fall out.  It seems to get caught in there until you undo the hose.  A little annoying, but overall I'm very satisfied with the product.  This is the first Bissell I've owned an I'm very happy with it.

Title: First DSLR
Content:
I read many reviews and it came down to 3 choices.  Canon XT, Sony D50, and the Pentax K100D.  All had their pros and cons, (i.e. battery types, style and look of body, continuous shooting buffer, etc.)  The Pentax is the heaviest due to 4 AA's, but battery life is fine with rechargeables and the weight makes it feel like a quality product.  Controls could not be better placed and 2.5" LCD is bright.
Manual is one of the easiest to read and the menus are pretty self-explanatory.  6.1 MP is fine for most amateur photographers and there are many lense options.  The lense provided is all purpose and I added a 50-300 zoom for sports and nature shots.
Great buy and would recommend to people who want some manual settings and desire to upgrade.

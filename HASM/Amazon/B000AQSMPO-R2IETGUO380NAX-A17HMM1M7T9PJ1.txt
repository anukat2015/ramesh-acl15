Title: I have yet to find someone that DOESN'T love a Keurig!
Content:
I have had my Keurig B70 for over a year and I can't imagine being without it.  I even purchased a B30 for travel.  I have also given away 8 Keurigs as gifts (so far) and EVERYONE seems to love them.  I bought this one for my Mother and she now says that uses it everyday and loves having a variety of coffee and teas both for herself and for when she has guests ("Speaking of guests" she said on the phone after she received her B60, "So when are YOU going to visit me Mr. Big Spender?")  Ahhh... mothers.

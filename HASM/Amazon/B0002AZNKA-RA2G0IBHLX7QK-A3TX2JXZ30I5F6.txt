Title: Won't support To Go services -- Don't support Creative
Content:
Before you buy, check out the blogs about Creative's customer service. There IS none! Most of us who spent a lot of money last year to buy a Creative Zen Nomad Xtra were disappointed to find out that this mp3 player does NOT support any of the Janus subscription services (like Rhapsody to Go, Napster to Go, Yahoo's to go service). That is bad enough, but any attempt to get a straight answer from the company about firmware updates (so that we CAN use these very cool services) is met with either no response, or a canned "This device does not support these services at this time." No one has been able to find out when or even IF they ever will. I suspect not.
The other problem is that both my Nomad and my son's have a serious freeze-up problem, one to the point of not being able to be used.
I would highly recommend another mp3 player if you are considering the Nomad and certainly don't buy from Creative, they pretty much don't care at all about their customers once you buy from them.

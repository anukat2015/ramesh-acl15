Title: Buyers Please Beware of what you are purchasing
Content:
Buyers, please pay particular attention to the 5 star review of this computer.  I know the price looks good but if it is not able to perform to your expectations, you're wasting your money.  First the hard drive is very small in comparison to todays standards.  Programs get larger with each new version requiring more space on your hard drive.  Downloading pictures and music will quickly eat up the 40 gig hard drive.  If you are just looking for a computer to type documents, log on to the internet to do minimal surfing read email......then this is an okay buy.  But don't expect it to perform with the high tech games that are available.......the processor speed is slow and ram is only 1/2 a gig.  Go to HP's or Dell's website and read the specs for their basic computers that will accommodate web surfing, downloading pictures and music and gaming.

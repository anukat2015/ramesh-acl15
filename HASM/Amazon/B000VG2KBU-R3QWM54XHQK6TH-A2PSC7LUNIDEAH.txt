Title: Great Little Machine
Content:
The Good:
*Value:  Does the job that iPod Nano does at fraction of a cost.
*Voice Recorder:  High-Quality Voice recording with a press of a button.
*No batteries needed: Charges via USB cable to the PC/laptop.
*Has options that many other MP3 players do not have.
The bad:
*No AM Radio:  While having FM Radio is great, it leaves AM radio to be desired.
The Bottom Line:
A great alternative to Apple or other popular MP3 product out there.  It does the job other more expensive players do and then some.  You can play music, videos and view pictures.  However, you can also view e-books listen to FM radio and even do voice recording.  Measures at 2.5 x 3.5 x 0.5 inches in dimensions and includes a wrist strap and a pouch that can double as a cloth for the player.  Displays time, date and includes some miscellaneous options such as play speed, EQ(bass boost, jazz, pop modes, etc) and supports many languages as well.  While I never heard of a Transcend brand before, I will be sure to keep an eye open on their future products due to a great product such at this one.

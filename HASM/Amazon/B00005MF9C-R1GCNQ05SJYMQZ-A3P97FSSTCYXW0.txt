Title: For a Perfect Cup O'Coffee
Content:
For those who don't have time in the morning for a full carafe,the Brew 'n Go is the ideal solution. It brews a perfect mug of joe for you descriminating coffee aficionados. Strength can be adjusted to individual taste, with no burnt flavor and no waste. The Brew 'n Go brews so quickly that it replaced the regular coffee maker on weekends in our household. Its rugged foolproof design promises years of enjoyment - I previously owned one that lasted several years.

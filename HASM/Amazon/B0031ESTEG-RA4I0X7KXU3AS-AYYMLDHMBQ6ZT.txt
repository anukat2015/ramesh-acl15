Title: Nice light computer but have some flaws
Content:
The mouse is annoying; I did read about this but thought it was not a big deal. Having only the thing for the left and right click need some getting use to but the big issue is the erratic behavior and some time it freezes up.
I am not a picky person so things like the flexing keyboard and your finger prints all over are no big deal to me.
The other issue is the heat; this laptop gets really hot on the left side.

Title: Great vacuum for the price!
Content:
I really wanted to get a Dyson, but the price was just too much.  Read the reviews on this vacuum, and decided to give it a go.  I haven't had a new vac in years, and the features on this model are wonderful.  The cord retracts with the touch of a button.  Power on and off, floor/carpet button and suction control are all on the vac handle.  It's easy to clean the dirt out of the container, and it pulls out a LOT of dirt!  Some of the other reviewers commented that it was a little noisy.  Since I had such an old vac which was very noisy, this thing sounds quiet to me!  It's a great vacuum at a great price.

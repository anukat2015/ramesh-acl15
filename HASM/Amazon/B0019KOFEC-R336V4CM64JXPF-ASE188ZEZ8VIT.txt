Title: Love it
Content:
I needed something easy to pull out and do my hardwoods and oriental rugs other than pulling out my full size vacuum.  This is quick and easy and has tons of suction!  I love it.  It is really good for my indoor/outdoor cat too.  It picks up the cat hair fantastic.  I would recommend it for anyone who needs something light weight and easy to use.

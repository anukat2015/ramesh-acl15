Title: BEST COMPUTER
Content:
honestly if you have enough to buy this computer but feel like saving money and going for the Dell, DONT. Dells suck terribly and even though you are paying a lot more up front for the mac and you might not be used to it at first, in the long run you are saving money and its just a way better computer. Dell screwed me over with tons of money and three computers that all became outdated very quick and even crashed, I have yet to encounter a problem with my mac and I do alot of work with music on it! Seriously the best investment I ever made, I will never consider buying windows again. The best part about this computer is the touch trackpad for the mouse, once you understand how to use all of its features, which is pretty quick, you will wish every computer had one. It makes web browsing and everything else so much easier!!! Go for it, this computer rocks the screen looks amazing!!!! Apple MacBook Pro MC118LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop!

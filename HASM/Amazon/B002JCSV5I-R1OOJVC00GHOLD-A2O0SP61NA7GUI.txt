Title: My first DSLR
Content:
Although I've owned SLRs before this is my first digital one so I don't know how helpful this review will for the experienced camera buyer but I love this camera. Mine came with 2 lenses; an 18-55mm and a 55-200mm.
Though there is a little bit of a learning curve (I'm not the brightest bulb on the tree), it's really simple to use, not as straight forward as my old Nikon F2 but almost. The large display has a very user friendly menu and it even has a 'help' button. The only other digital camera I've ever owned had a Byzantine menu tree to navigate if you wanted to adjust f-stop or shutter speed. And the VR - Vibration Reduction - feature on both of the lens is a real hoot. I was able to hand hold a 5 second exposure!
Of course unless you're making billboards you don't need 10MP, we were making slides with 6MP, but I guess everyone always assumes that bigger must be better.
It does have some negatives (no pun). At 1600 ISO the picture gets a bit mushy. I suppose that's to be expected but I'm told other models have better resolution. It doesn't have a movie mode which would be nice (although my other camera had it and I think I used it once). There's no preview, the only way to see the shot is through the viewfinder. Is that true for all DSLRs? It doesn't come with a memory card, you need to buy that separately, though I got 8 GB for $20 so it's not a big deal. And you can't download directly into Photoshop, you have to go through the supplied Nikon software. Not a problem at home but if you're visiting friends and want to see you're shots on their computer, they'd better have the software.

Title: Don't buy it. Go with another brand!
Content:
I have owned this stove for more than a year.  It has been nothing but a head ache.  It smokes up my house and has shut down for countless reasons.  I take a lot of care in running the stove and cleaning it...more than the average person would care to face.  Their customer service is horrible.  I find it hard to believe they own the stoves themselves with how they blame each and every problem on the customer.  According to them they have no "problems".  I love the idea of burning corn for fuel but I would definatley try out a different model and different company.  Anyone interested in this model should research the difficulties other people face.  I am definately not the only one wouldn't you agree?

Title: Best. Heater. Ever.
Content:
I just bought this back in December to heat my 'Man Cave'.  Its a sizable room above a detached garage and gets really cold, below freezing at times.  This heater is a lifesaver out there.  Its a little big and a little noisy (though, I've yet to see a ceramic space heater that wasn't a little noisy) but heats like a champ.  It can be 30 degrees outside and this will have it a 350 sq ft room up to the 60s in only a few hours.  If I know its going to be a super cold night then I'll run it on a timer for a few hours prior to going to bed and turn it on an hour or so before I want to go spend time out there and its warm and comfy.  The high settings is great at bringing the temp up and the low is good at quietly maintaining that comfort zone.  Just one note, this heater (like most) is 1500 watts on the high setting which is around 12.5 amps meaning if it isn't on a dedicated circuit you won't be able to run much else on the same circuit before you hit the typical 15 amp circuit load.

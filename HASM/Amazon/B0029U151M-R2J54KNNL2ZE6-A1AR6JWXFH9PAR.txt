Title: Good machine - Very, Very Bad Support
Content:
The machine came with a certificate for Windows 7, which arrived after a phone call inquiring as to its whereabouts.
In the middle of the install which required the optical drive, the optical drive disappeared and the install was unable to continue.
Tech support promised to install Windows 7 if the machine was sent to them (at my expense - $50) but returned it with the old Vista reloaded.
I am using this machine but cancelled the orders for the remaining 10 units and have told my people to never purchase an ACER product again.

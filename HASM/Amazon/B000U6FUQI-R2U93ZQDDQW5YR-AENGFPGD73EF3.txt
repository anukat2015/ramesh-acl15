Dirt Devil 0313SLV KRUZ Cordless Floor Vacuum Cleaner We purchased this exactly one year ago, and I am now awaiting  delivery on a replacement charging deck. Although the stick unit engages properly into the deck, the light does not go on, not allowing the unit to charge anymore. Even when it was operating correctly, it would not hold a charge for very long. Also, this vacuum is not in the least bit  versatile. It has but one specific task: that is to roll easily across your hard floor surfaces and look absolutely stunning doing it. Let's face it - I didn't buy this vacuum for function - I bought it for its handsome form. Who really cares if it works or not? Designed by Karim Rashid, its intellectual space-age aesthetic was its only real attraction to me. Hopefully, production will soon end on this MOMA machine. I'll pack mine away (in its original box) so on eBay, my grand children can cash in on its future collectible value. Meanwhile, for exceptional results, I'll be forced to rely on a real vacuum cleaner - my 2009 Oreck Platinum XL - and never look back.

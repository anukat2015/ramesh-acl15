Title: So frustrated with it, I give up
Content:
My mom bought each of her 3 sons this same coffeemaker for Christmas in 2004. I'm one of the 3 sons. Anyway, I've had a couple of annoying problems with it over the past few months. First, the cheap plastic hinge that covers the water reservoir broke off, and I have trouble closing it. Second, and worse, the coffee has not been going into the coffee pot, but rather all over my kitchen counter, and this has stained my countertop permanently I think. Well, I've cleaned the plastic parts many times per the instructions, yet I can't figure out why the coffee won't make it into the pot. It seems like a simple concept for a machine to achieve, but it doesn't do so properly every morning. So I've had an awful mess many, many times, yet I've thought perhaps it would somehow stop doing this. Finally, a few days ago, I called Cuisinart's customer service group for help and to find out if there was a recall. My first call was disconnected when a rep placed me on hold. Then, when I later called back, twice, my call was never answered. 
For whatever its worth, I talked to my 2 other brothers, and was surprised to learn that they both threw their coffee maker out months ago, for the very same spilling problem I'm having. I give up. I can't wake up to this problem any more, especially without caffeine yet in my blood. I expected better from Cuisinart. They don't seem to care about me at all. And my mother wasted a lot of her Christmas money that year.

Title: Perfect For My Needs
Content:
The main reasons I was interested in this coffee maker were for the thermal properties of the carafe and the quality of coffee the machine makes.  I wasn't interested in whether or not I could see the water in the reservoir or see how much coffee was left in the pot.  I wanted a machine that would allow me to stop making multiple pots of coffee throughout the morning.  Most of the time, I would make myself coffee early in the morning, then, make my wife a pot around 10 or 11.  Our old coffee maker would burn coffee after about 45 minutes.  With the Cuisinart, all I have to do is put hot water in the carafe prior to brewing, pour it out, and brew my coffee as usual.  After the coffee is made, I put the stylish carafe on our coffee table or living room table, and we have coffee for the whole morning.  I don't have to worry about the pot burning any of our table/counter surfaces because it's double insulated.  That's the beauty of this carafe--its basically a large, stylish thermos.  
All of the other minor issues I can deal with.  Guess what?  You can pour water into the chamber with something other than the coffee pot.  You know how many cups of coffee you can pour before the pot is empty?  The exact number you poured from your old coffee pot.  If you had a 12-cup maker prior to this one, subtract 1 large coffee mug from that number.  I'm not real sure what people are expecting from this machine.  It makes above-average coffee and keeps it hot without burning or scalding.

Title: ceramic heater
Content:
it heats but there's not much way to regulate it, no thermostat or temp guide and compared to other ceramic heaters i own, it's a loser.  Better to buy one slightly more expensive and be able to control it better. Also doesn't throw as much heat as I had expected without running at full blast and sucking down electricity.

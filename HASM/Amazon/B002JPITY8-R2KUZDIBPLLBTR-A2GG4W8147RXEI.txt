Title: Excellent PMP
Content:
Everything about this release shows that the Zune (brand) has now matured.  The 4.0 software has much needed features, and is even more fun to use than the last version.  The player itself is like a quantum leap from the previous generation Zunes.  It's fair to say that the Zune can now compete with the iTouch.
Pros:
OLED - movies/games/navigation are all extremely vivid....even the music with the cover art and scrolling info are a nice visual touch
Apps - even though the offering is meager right now, it won't be long before some great games/apps start appearing on the marketplace.
HD Radio - this to me is still a must have for a PMP, especially with the ability to identify a song and purchase via the marketplace just by hearing on the HD Radio
Browser - while it's not the latest IE, it's still great to be able to browse the web via the same device
Navigation - the quicklist, the drill-down screen views, and the natural touch movements make this very easy to get used to
Cons:
Left button media control - this is actually harder to press than I originally thought, and this button comes in handy....it's not bad placement, it should just be either raised or as wide as the device itself
Screen size - I watch movies when I travel, and I wish the screen were just a tad bigger.  The Zune80 had a good movie viewing screen.
Memory - Right now I have many pictures/podcasts/mp3's and I can only fit 5~6 movies.  On the older Zune I had everything plus was able to fit an additional 30-40 movies.  Would've been nice to offer a memory card slot, this would be a huge competitive advantage.
In any regard, this far exceeds my expectations and so far I'm completely satisfied.

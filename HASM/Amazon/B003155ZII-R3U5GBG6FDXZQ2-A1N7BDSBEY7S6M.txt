Acer Aspire AS5740-6025 15.6-Inch Laptop (Blue) (Purchased on 03/21/2010)  
I love the large screen and full size keyboard. The machine is optimized and I keep it that way. I did uninstall a few software features that were in the startup, but those didn't really slow the machine down noticeably anyway. I purchased an optical mouse with the system since I never used a mouse pad before and when I did use mine... man... not for me. 
Turn it on and everything step by step. All the updates to the installed software went easily!  
The Crystal eye web-cam is very good. Core I-5 processor is fast. The display is beautiful -- wide-screen view. A 500GB hard disk and 4GB of RAM! Very NICE. I love the case -- navy blue with shimmer.

Title: iPod killer
Content:
I received my new 16GB ZEN a couple of days ago and I have to say I am very impressed with that little player. The player came out of the box with the newest firmware and so its startup time is amazingly fast now, basically you push the powerbutton and the player starts playing the song it was playing when you turned it off in less than 2 seconds. The sound of the new ZEN is very clear and deep, which is tipical for all creative players in recent years. The player sounds much much better than any iPod I have heard, and the only brand that can beat that sound is Cowon, but of course that comes at a higher price. Especially if you get very good headphones the sound of the ZEN becomes very very good. I only care about music so that is why I focus on the sound mostly, but I have to say that the display is also very bright and clear. And the player looks better when you actually see than on the pictures. Also the transfer of files is much faster compared to the iPod counterpart, I also like the navigation better. One thing I don't like is the power button, it is not the most convenient button on a player but I can live with that. Apart from that I cannot really say anything else negative about this player, it did live up to my expectations and I am very satisfied. And about the the review that says it doesn't support Amazon Unbox videos, you can ignore that because it does. I couldn't care less about this feature but apparently some people do.

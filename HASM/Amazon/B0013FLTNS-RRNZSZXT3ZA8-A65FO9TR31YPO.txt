Title: MacBook Pro Review
Content:
I have been a PC user for many years now (since 1997, when I got my first Pentium MMX running at 233 MHz), but after recently purchasing the MacBook Pro from Apple, I have to say my Windows days are over. I had previously played with a PowerBook and was thinking about getting a Mac, but not really knowing anything about the operating system or compatibility with other machines not running Leopard kept me away. Now, after getting the MacBook Pro, i have to say there is nothing more simple and intuitive than the Mac OS. A fine product, with attention to detail. As they say in the ads, even the power plug is a feature. Overall, the Mac seems to have been thought of as a jewel running everything with no errors rather than as a computer. It looks great and works just as well. 10+

Title: Saves all the "trouble" with making coffee
Content:
What I love about this machine is that I can set it to always come on about 20 minutes before I leave for work.  Then, when I'm racing around in the morning grabbing everything because I'm late, it's simply a matter of grabbing a K-cup, tossing it in the machine and hitting the brew button.  In less than a minute, my coffee is ready and I'm heading out the door.  I always brew it into my jar thermos Thermos #2330 10 OZ Stainless Steel Food Jar for quick coffee on the go that I can drink on the way to work or at work.

Title: This sucks! Do Not Buy!
Content:
This is the only review I have ever written, but this vacuum has been so horrible I just has to give my opinion. 1- The suction is not great, and when you run the vacuum in bare floors mode it doesn't pick up anything.  2- The extension cord for the attachments ("designed by NASA") is so stiff, when you use the attachments the vacuum is constantly falling over onto tables, my foot, ect. and you must drag the machine around with you to keep one hand on it at all times. 3- It is hard to clean. You have several parts that must be washed out and left to dry completely, even using a hair dryer it takes a couple days and it never dries in the nooks.  4- Emptying the container is a huge mess. The dust does not come out easily and so must be knocked out in the garbage which sends dust flying everywhere. It MUST be done outside. I get a lung full of dust every time. Actually, last month a wind kicked up just as I was emptying it out and I inhaled so much dust I got a bronchial infection and needed to go on antibiotics! 5- The plastic is cheap. The plastic latch at the bottom of the dust canister broke off today, and spilled dirt all over my living room. It went everywhere! I have FINALLY thrown the thing in the garbage. What a waste!    My two cents.

Title: BOSH vs Braun
Content:
I gave up on my Braun Tassimo (gave it the local thrift store) and purchased a BOSH machine.   To me there is one big difference in these two machines.   BOSH you turn on the unit put in a T discs push the go button go way come back and you have a cup of coffee.  Braun you turn on the machine, wait until the auto light comes on - them you push the auto go button, and it makes a cup of coffee.  If you miss the movement to auto the unit reverts to stand by and you start over.

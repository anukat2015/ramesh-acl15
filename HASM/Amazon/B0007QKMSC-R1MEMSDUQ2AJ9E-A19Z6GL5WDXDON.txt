Title: It's a snap to use
Content:
After recieving my EOS I was alittle overwhelmed by all the buttons and gadgets, but after using it for awhile it became a snap to use. The amazing way it handles taking multi pictures in succession was very impressive. The picture quality is near that of a film camera. I was very satisfied with the price and the delivery time after I ordered my EOS Rebel XT. I got the camera and lens combination, extra battery, gadget bag, and a tele-zoom lens for the price of just the body at most retail outlets. Thanks Amazon for the oppertunity to upgrade.

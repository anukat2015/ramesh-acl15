Title: A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY
Content:
I purchased this vacuum based on the great reviews; however, I wish I hadn't.  Terrible on carpets even with the special carpet attachment and will only pick up the smallest items on hardwood floors.  If you have a leaf or a penny, forget it.  I have to sweep my hardwood floors BEFORE I vacuum because even the smallest little piece of paper or other household fluff gets left behind.  The bag is the tiniest, very expensive, and only fills 1/3 of the way before the machine tells you it's full.  ONLY good thing is the retractable cord.  As soon as I get this thing paid off, I'm buying another brand as soon as possible

Title: Good but stolen
Content:
I've had this iPod since the spring and I loved it. Took it everywhere ALL THE TIME. Bought the black transpod to play in the car, used it everyday. Then last night some wanker broke into my car and stole it along with a bunch of other stuff. Now it is discontinued and I'm torn between a nano and the video one. Moral: DON'T LEAVE YOUR IPOD IN PLAIN VIEW, ESPECIALLY SITTING IN THE TRANSPOD.

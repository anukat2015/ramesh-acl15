Title: Excellent filter and cheaper subsitute
Content:
I was weary of buying the "official" filters for my Miele vacuum cleaner.
They seemed to be about 9-cents each.  These bring the cost down to a fraction of the price.  The substitutes are not as well made, but so what?  They get the job done.  And with a dog in the household, we use more than in the past.  I will be ordering these again.

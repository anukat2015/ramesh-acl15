Title: Good Overall
Content:
The red color is better than I thought (I didn't have chance to see it in store before buying it). The temperature is not high at all after turning on for a whole day. The only problem I had was a permanent fatal blue screen error, but after I contacted with SONY customer service, they sent me a technician and changed the RAM and HD for free. It finally got fixed. I think this is just an unlucky hardware problem.
Be sure to burn recovery disk right after you receive your VAIO, or they will ask you to purchase one before sending any technician, which is annoying.

Title: Simply the Best DSLR  for the buck
Content:
For the money, and alot more money this is the best camera ever, I have owned them all, Nikon, Minolta, Cannon, Pentax, Kodak, you name it, and this is by far the most bang ever for my buck. Plus I saved over $500 with Amazon, $499 is just to good for what i got with a lens? Wow! with the 510 coming, why spend $1000 for it when you can get this for $500?

Title: Will never buy Eureka again
Content:
After doing some research and also due to the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, we purchased the Eureka Uno vacuum last year.  BIG MISTAKE!
It does have great suction on the carpets, but the filter cap was constanly getting plugged up, even when the "bagless" cannister was empty. It was gross having to manually pull pet hair and dirt out of it every time it was used.  The UNO actually made more dirt when used on the bare floors, leaving a trail behind bigger than what it had just cleaned up! After calling the company and taking it in twice for service, we finally threw it out.  I felt sorry for the garbage picker who took it. Our local vacuum repair man said Eureka recently merged with Electrolux and ever since they have made "junk"  I agree.

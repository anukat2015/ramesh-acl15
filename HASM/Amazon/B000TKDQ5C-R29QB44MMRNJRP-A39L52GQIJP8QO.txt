Title: Good for the money
Content:
I have a decent sized bedroom for a college student (probably 13x11) and a walk in closet. I live in an older house in Buffalo NY which has terrible insulation. Two giant windows which let cold air in as if I had them open. And when I run this heater, the room stays consistantly comfortable. I haven't gotten into the coldest nights yet but what i've been doing is setting it on high to warm up the room, then just leave it on low to maintain temperature and it does a fantastic job. Used this item for about 2-3 weeks last month and my electric bill increased about 8 dollars more than average. As it gets colder though, I will have to use it even more which will definitely mean higher electric bills. I give this item a 4.8/5 stars.

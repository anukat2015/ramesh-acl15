Title: Bissell 3920 Pet Hair Eraser vacuum
Content:
This vacuum does a great job at removing pet hair and dirt from carpet. I was amazed at the amount of dirt and hair that it picked up the 1st time I used it. My old vacuum broke about 2 weeks before I bought this new machine. I had been using my shop vac during these two weeks. This vacuum has geat suction and is easy to empty. 
The only complaint that I have with this vacuum is that it doesn't work real well on hard floors. It just sort of pushes the dirt around. However, I have the shop vac for the hard floors. 
Also, the hose really stretches all the way up to the 2nd floor. This is great for doing the stairs. It pushes easy and isn't very loud.

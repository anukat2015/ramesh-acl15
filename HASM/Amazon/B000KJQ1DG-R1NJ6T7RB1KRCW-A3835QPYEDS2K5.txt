Title: My new best friend in the office
Content:
This camera has helped a tremendous amount, and I've only had it for a week.
I'm a community and sports journalist in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We cover a broad range from municipal meetings and school events to community fundraisers and high school sports. I picked up the camera and received a third-party telephoto lens from a fellow professional photographer and it shoots sports like a dream. I just downloaded about 150 frames of a soccer game and I was only there for 20 minutes.
When I picked up the camera, I grabbed a 2 GB card on sale from the site. My only regret is not ordering a back-up battery, which I intend to in the coming week. The battery lasted about a week through a variety of shoots but died in the middle of one which is unfortunate.
A fine fit for anyone. Out of the box, I got great photos around the house in time for Easter. Also a nice find for someone trying to improve their overall photo results whether they be for publication (like me) or simple enjoyment around the house.

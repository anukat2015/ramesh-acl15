Title: good to take the chill out of the air
Content:
I bought this to supplement the poor heating in my large room.  It is good when left on for long periods of time, and it helps to take the chill out of the air.  Just don't expect anything too powerful from this.  My room is quite large though, and I realize it recommends using it in a 12x10 room, but it's still been helpful for me.  It was also much larger than I expected, it's 2x2 ft square, so make sure you have enough room on your wall for the heater, and still extra space on either side to prevent things from catching on fire.  I believe it recommends having 3' on each side of the heater, but mine is doing fine with about a foot and a half of extra space on each side.

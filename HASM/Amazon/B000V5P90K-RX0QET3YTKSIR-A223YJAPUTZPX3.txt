Title: Amazing
Content:
Before this camera I had a Minolta Dimage A2 and a digital point and shoot.  My main subjects are children and other family members.  The reason we upgraded was to get a camera that could capture speedy kids and to break into semi-professional photography.  This camera is amazingly fast.  The kit lens is actually a pretty good lens.  It is not a professional $1500 lens, but it is pretty good.  The image stabalization is very helpful.  If you want great shots for family or are planning on beggining your photography carreer I absolutly recommend this.  It is pricy, but well worth it.

Title: Cats beat quiet Vac
Content:
I have several indoor cats.  The vacuum is nice and quiet and doesn't scare them like other vacuums do.  However, suction is a bit light and you have to go over a spot several times to pick up everything.  The power-head gets jammed with cat hair around the ends of the brush rollers in a very short time and is nearly impossible to clean out.  The vacuum is sturdy, but the attachments are cheap and fragile.  The bags and filters are easy to change.  Overall, it's a very good vacuum, but the poor attachment quality and light suction are soundly defeated by cats.  If you deal with pet hair, get a Dirt Devil bag-less upright (at least 12-amp), and a Eureka Power Paw attachment for furniture.

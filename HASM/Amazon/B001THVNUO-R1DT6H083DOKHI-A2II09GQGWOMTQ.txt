Title: Perfect for my bedroom.
Content:
How does one go about reviewing an air conditioner? 
Well............ 
It looks nice, it's sleek and sexy. 
Hmmmmmm..... 
The pros? 
It's cheap, it's easy to put together, it comes with a remote,the display is very easy to read. 
It's an air conditioner, dehumidifier, and fan all in one. 
Most importantly.........IT WORKS!!! 
I live in an apartment and there is a wall air conditioner in the living room. 
That's nice but it does NOTHING for the bedroom which is like a blast furnace during summer. 
This little air conditioner cooled my room off in no time. 
The window kit is easy to put in, I have slider windows. 
If you have casement windows you'll have to find some way to improvise. 
The cons? 
The instructions are kind of crappy. 
I hate drawn diagrams. 
The little tube thingy that snaps in the back of the unit was anything but easy to get in, but after some cramming it went in. 
All in all.........I LOVE IT. 
It's cute, it's little, it was delivered VERY quickly. 
And most importantly...........IT WORKS. 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

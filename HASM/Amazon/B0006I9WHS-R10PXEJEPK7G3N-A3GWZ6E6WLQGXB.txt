Title: Just what I needed
Content:
This little number does exactly what I needed it to.  It heats up quick, and shuts down right when it reaches the preferred temperature.  I use this under my desk at work, and it works amazingly.  I just wish that I turned off completely, I have to make sure I unplug it before I leave for the day.  It often heats up the entire office, with all doors closed, and this office is pretty large.  I would recommend.  Great item for the price.

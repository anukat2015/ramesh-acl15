Title: I started out cheap and learned the hard way.
Content:
I bought this coffee maker from amazon a couple years ago and am getting ready to replace it since I bought a high-end espresso machine.
I've been reading through the reviews and I'm shocked so many people have so many negative things to say; I never had issues with this machine.  It did everything it claimed to do, and it did it well-enough, but then I had previously owned several lower rung machines that I considered to be far worse.
One reviewer said the frothing wand was counter-intuitive... he's right.  It's on an odd arch that makes it difficult to swivel. But it's hardly impossible to work with.  The frother on this machine actually works remarkably well.  You'll get good foam.
And no, you can't make espresso and steam milk at the same time. 
If there is one legitimate complaint to make about the design of this machine it's that it contains a flap for something that isn't used on this model; literally, there's a lid that opens up right over the espresso portion of the machine & it serves no purpose.  Maybe you store stuff in there?  I don't know, but whatever you do, don't pour water in.
Lastly, the only other "complaint" I can make is the espresso itself.  You are not going to get barista quality espresso from a machine like this.  Depending on what your tastebuds find tolerable, you will get an espresso that's drinkable, but there are far too many factors that contribute to flavor. The beans themselves, the quality of the grind, the amount of pressure -- all of these are of the utmost importance when talking flavorful espresso.

Title: Love this heater
Content:
Bought this heater to replace an expensive, mail ordered, quartz infrared heater that lasted as long as the warranty--ditto for my sister's expensive quartz infrared heater... 
Love this heater! This heater is solid with tower and baseboard position options; even in the upright position it's solid, which is good since it does not have a automatic shut-off if it gets tipped over although it does have a safety roll bar and front bars and shuts off if the grill is obstructed. I keep the heat in my house low and just heat my work area, and the heat output has been more than adequate for me during the cold Iowa winter. Once I got used to the control symbols which are all on one knob, it was a cinch--I don't like to read instruction. A small carpet remnant took care of the vibrating noise on the hardwood floor while in the tower position. There is a timer, two heat settings, keep warm setting, and even a summer air circulation function, but no remote control. 
Despite a few shortcomings, I gave it 5 stars--I'm hoping for a long life out of this heater and plan to make an expensive end-table out of my nonfunctioning quartz infrared heater.

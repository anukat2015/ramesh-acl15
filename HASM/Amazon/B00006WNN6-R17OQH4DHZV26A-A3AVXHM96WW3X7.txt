Title: Great heater w/fan feature, thermostat
Content:
First off, I want to say that I've owned this heater/fan for at least 6 years.  Bought it for my office at work, and it is on nearly every day (yes, I'm one of those "chilly" women!)
Pros about this heater:
--Fairly quiet (I keep it right under my desk in my small office at work and I can still talk on the phone)
--Compact size
--Designed so that it really can't tip over (you'd have to push it over)
--The front "fins" stick out enough so you could never touch the hot part
--The controls are easy to use without looking at them.  I keep my heater tucked away under my desk and I can just use the controls by touch.
There are two dials: 
The left side controls the heat or fan setting:  high heat, low heat, fan, off.  
The right side allows you to adjust the thermostat setting (how hot it must get before the fan kicks on or shuts off).  
I tend to keep the heater on the high heat setting, but can always kick it on or off by just reaching down and moving the thermostat dial over a bit.  
The ONLY con to this heater is that after over 6 years of daily use, it finally conked out on me and I have to see if I can find another one.  :(

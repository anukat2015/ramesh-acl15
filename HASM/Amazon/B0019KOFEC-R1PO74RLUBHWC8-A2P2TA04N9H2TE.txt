Title: Mighty Mite aptly named
Content:
This little baby really works!  It sucks up dirt better than the big guys! Our house, built in 1852, has wide pine board floors and it even gets the dirt out from between the cracks. It also glides over the bumpy thresholds like a charm. I can place it on the stairs to vacuum them, it is very light weight and not very noisy. A couple of suggestions - 1. get some good attachments-a natural bristle floor brush, dusting brush and a good crivice tool from a dedicated vacuum cleaner store and 2. cover the air flow adjuster with a piece of painters tape so you don't pinch your fingers.  You can easily remove the tape if you want less air flow.  The pet hair brush works like a charm.  We are going to buy another one soon as a back up in case this one breaks and it is no longer available.

Title: Nice Vacuum - watch the price.
Content:
Bought this before Christmas 2008 from Amazon for about $198. We're happy with it. I agree with other reviewers that it's quiet and has good suction, there should be an extra length of metal hose for the attachments and the handle is a little heavy, but overall it is a good machine and I'd recommend it.
BTW, it takes C-5 bags (aka Kenmore 5055), not the C20E bags "Frequently bought together" with it at this time.

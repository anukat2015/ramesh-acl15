Title: Too much work to get it to work
Content:
I have carefully analyzed all the reviews (positive and negative) before deciding to buy this product in order that the right level of expectation may be set.  My need is very simple.  I have almost all hard floors in my house, either tile or hardwood.  So floor keeping is a relatively low maintenance chore.  I know Flip-It serves both as a dry vacuum and wet mop.  Knowing that both dry and wet debris are going into the same place and I want to eliminate the messy task of cleaning out the wet gunk, so I opt to use the cleaner solely as an electric mop.  
I like the idea that while it is mopping, the machine can also take care of the small amount of debris that I missed in my "pre-mopped" vacuuming.  It does take some practice to get the machine to do the job right.  Although I don't have the problem of puddles of water as other have experienced, I have other issue such as the cleaning pad kept sliding out.  I find the maneuvering quite exhausting due to the squeegee design.  Also, my finger gets very tired from squeezing the solution release button.  I don't find the cleaning result dramatic perhaps because my floors are normally quite clean.  The machine will not get to the wall edges so it won't eliminate manual laboring.  I'm also not sure if the heating feature does anything to produce a cleaner floor since the water temperature does not felt very warm.  After two days of experimentation, I decided that the machine is going back to the store.  For light mopping, I am going back to my Swiffer Wetjet.  It is cheaper, quiet, lighter, easy to use, and best of all, no cleaning up required.

Title: Going from SLR to DSLR
Content:
Prior to buying the D300, I was very familiar with film SLR's and had quite a bit of experience with digital imagery, but this was my first DSLR. I estimated that I was probably over the hump in the learning curve when I purchased this camera.  BOY I WAS WRONG!
It turns out that wasn't such a bad thing. I've enjoyed the challenge, and the more I discover about this camera, the more I love it.
Unfortunately the user's manual that comes with the camera (400 pages), doesn't do a good job of coalescing the camera's individual features into useful information. There are A LOT of features and most of them have variable settings. Is it intimidating to think about all these variables every time you want to take a picture? You bet! Don't worry, Nikon has thought of this. By selecting between Shooting Menu and Custom banks allows you to change dozens of settings all at once.
I eventually bought a book on the D300 which covers everything in the manual but makes all the necessary connections between features and gives you a thorough understanding of how to effectively apply them (the author's name is Busch). I only wish I had bought the book when I bought the camera.  It would've saved me a lot of time.
I'm happy to say that my D300 is now configured for nearly any photo situation I might encounter.

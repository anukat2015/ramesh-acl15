Title: Great travel companion
Content:
I researched my purchase for several weeks and finally bought this model in early March.  This model has it all--lightweight, resolution, 64 bit windows, bluetooth, speed and a great battery.  I debated buying the NB305-410BL netbook.  I'm glad I bought this slightly larger computer because it's has all the qualities of a netbook with better performance, resolution and potential.  I have not had any technical issues.  I went to the Toshiba website and ensured it had all the latest drivers and software.  I did have to update the sound driver for the sound level but it was no problem.  I recently purchased a Mobile Edge case .Mobile Edge MESSM7-13 13-Inch Neoprene SlipSuit (Red) to protect it.  The case is made for the Macbook but fits great around this T135-S1310 plus it has a pocket for some smaller devices.  The AC cord will not fit but I store it in another area when I travel.  I definitely would purchase this product again

Title: Great small room air conditioner
Content:
We bought this AC unit to but into my son's smaller bedroom.  We had read that is loud but it sure is NOT loud!  The only problem we had was the remote went out quickly but we found replacement batteries here at Amazon and now it works like a charm!  I would completely recommend this AC unit to ANYONE looking for a small unit!

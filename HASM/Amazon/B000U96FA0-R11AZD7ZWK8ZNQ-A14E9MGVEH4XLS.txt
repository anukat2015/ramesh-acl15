Title: Excellent Heater!
Content:
I bought this unit to heat my small rancher. My house is raised just above the bay, and the water below can make the rooms and floors freezing in the fall and winter months. When I got the heater, I turned it on and my entire home was warmed up within 10 minutes. Its so easy to use and circulates the warmed air all throughout the rooms and hallway. The unit does not get hot to the touch, and all of its features are simple to operate and convenient. I highly recommend this heater, its the best i've ever had!

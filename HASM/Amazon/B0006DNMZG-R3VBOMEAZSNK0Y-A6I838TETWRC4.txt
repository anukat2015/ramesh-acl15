Title: WARNING! - DANGEROUS FIRE HAZARD!
Content:
Honeywell claims that this space heater has a shut-off safety mechanism when it tips over.  Well, it only works if it tips forward or backward.  If it tips over on either side, it will continue to run.  Being that it has a cylindrical shape, if it tips forward or backward, it can roll to a side position and start running again.  Therefore, I would not recommend this item to anyone with small children or pets.

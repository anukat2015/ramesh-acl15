Title: Light to handle, fast upload
Content:
I bough this Laptop to design albums and slideshows for my photography business just to use some software that are exclusive for PC. The Laptop Loads very fast when you turn it on and the windows 7 feels very light and stable.
The battery life is closer to 1.5 hours and not even close to 4 hours. I have had before 3 HP and this one is the lighter in weight.

Title: Good product received in good condition
Content:
I purchased this heater mainly to use it in my office. It works perfectly, and I like how the thermostat sets the temperature. It is a bit noisy, but honestly I don't even notice the noise! It also has a fan, which is great! I highly recommend this product.
Thank God for Amazon, because I bought this in summer and none of the stores had any heater left. So thank you Amazon!! I no longer freeze at work.

Title: I like it; will the finicky?
Content:
To me it is fast, the coffee tastes great, and the
thermal carafe makes it much more convenient. 
On the other hand my mother-in-law orders her
coffee at Starbucks at "165 degrees" and I am
not sure it would meet that muster without some
fussing, say by preheating the carafe. (I have
not tested it on her yet)

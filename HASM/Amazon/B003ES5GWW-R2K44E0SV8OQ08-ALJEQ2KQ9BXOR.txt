Title: Apple iTouch is better
Content:
I got this for Christmas 2009 then exchanged it for an Apple iTouch 32G.
I would have kept it with all its faults had it not had a problem whereby the display would not return when buttons pressed.  I only use it to work out.  I would go to adjust the volume, and nothing I could do could make the display come back.  It would continue to play music, and I could adjust the volume by guessing where to press the black screen.  I feel the unit was released too soon and is buggy. I know have my iTouch so I can give you both sides.
- PC SOFTWARE.  You have to load software on your PC in order to put music on your device.  Here's a BIG hint for you.  You can go to apple and zune and download the software and compare.  You don't have to buy a unit yet.  You can load up all your music into the software.  It would be a huge waste of time if you were not planning to buy a unit.  But it's a BIG help to compare if you are thinking of buying. You will find that Zune software is miles ahead of iTunes.  iTunes is designed to make it hard to manage external mp3 collections and easy to manage stuff you buy from Apple.  Anybody who already has mp3s will Hate the iTunes software and the iTouch unit.  There are no context menus in Windows Explorer, there is no way to select multiple folders (you have a little tiny window to scroll through all your stuff and pick a folder at a time). It isn't even possible to synch folders with iTunes, so every time you add/change/remove a song on your PC you have to go into iTunes software and do the same in both the music collection and the playlist (so you have to do the same thing 3 times).  Zune software makes it easy to synch folders and keep them synched automatically.
- SOUND QUALITY.  The Zune sound quality is great, but then so is the iTouch.  I didn't notice a difference.
- VIDEO QUALITY.  Zune HD ... big deal ... I didn't notice a difference in video quality.  I loaded the exact same videos on both units and didn't notice a difference.  I guess if you have perfect vision, maybe you can tell.  Good luck with that.
- FORM FACTOR.  Both looked great.  Both were about the same thickness.  Both had a metal back and a quality feel.  iTouch was heavier (not a negative to me).
- CHANGING THE VOLUME.  This was a big deal to me. And there was a big difference.  I change the volume A LOT, and it was a pain to constantly have to wake up the Zune display and adjust the volume on the display.  This was made more difficult by a display that didn't always work (refer above).  The iTouch is much better.  It has a volume button on the unit so you don't have to mess with the display or navigating menus.  
- EARPHONES.  Both were cheesy.  Zune was the worst.  The foam protectors were impossible to put on, and didn't stay on long when you could get them on.  Sound quality was poor on both.  With the iTouch you get a wonderful feature ... you get to control volume from the earphones and even speak commands into the microphone.  The BIG down side is you have to buy Apple's earphones.  Everyone else's don't have the volume/mic option.  I checked Apple's web site and other places.  The iTouch is so new that you are limited to the single cheesy earphone option. I'm using an Sennheiser PMX100 I bought from Amazon and it sounds great.
- GAMES AND APPLICATIONS.  This one is easy.  Zune has about 8-10 that Microsoft just released for free in order to have SOMETHING to put on the Zune. THAT'S IT!  iTouch has about a million.
- BUYING MUSIC.  The Apple store is normal.  The Zune store is insane.  Microsoft is using a complicated gimmic (Microsoft pretend money) to make their music look cheap.  [...]
- INTERNET.  This made me mad.  Microsoft didn't want to pay Adobe for a Flash license for their Zunes, so you can't view Youtube videos or anything else that requires flash from their browser.  That is a BIG negative.  What do they think people are going to do with a tiny screen?  Read big long articles!  No.  Also their mobile phone OS doesn't do flash either.  Micro$oft likes being a monopoly.  They want their proprietary Silverlight to take the place of Flash.  Good luck with that.
- HELP.  Both were totally useless.  Zune help is nothing more than a forum search engine.  And from my attempts to get help, Zune users must take drugs alot. iTunes help uses an ancient form of help that Microsoft disposed of years ago.  I got no help there either.  If you are a Windows user, you will not be happy with iTunes software.
BOTTOM LINE.  I like the iTouch a lot more.  No bugs found yet.  Easy to change volume. And I could spend the rest of my life downloading apps if I wanted to (I don't want to, but I could).
9 Jan Update ... I forgot to mention that you will be speaking to somebody in India if you dare call Zune support. Yet another example of Micro$oft greed. One of the richest companies in the world is outsourcing support to save money (thus making more profit). Outsourcing robs Americans of jobs. I don't know what Apple does because I haven't had to call support because their stuff works. 
11 Jan Update ... I just installed Skype on the iTouch.  Now, when I'm in a wireless coverage area, the iTouch can make and receive calls (made possible by the microphone built into the earphone cord).  Not possible with Zune since there is no microphone capability.  Amazing!  Now I have an mp3 player, media center, game console, google maps, google earth, weather, and phone!  All free apps! And the last known estimate I found indicates there are about 100,000 more apps to choose from (most not free).  Many people have over 150 apps on there iTouch with a few over 2000.

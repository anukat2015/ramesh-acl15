Title: Great Idea - Horrible Execution
Content:
I bought this device for my 13 year old son.  Great form factor, easy to install and use software.  We transferred all his CDs onto the device quickly and easily and then the wheels came off the wagon.  We could see all the songs on the device but could not get any of them to play.  There is no tech support number-you can only send emails which go unanswered.  I had a number of folks well versed in other MP3 players look at it with no luck.  I returned it to the store and they could not get it to play either.  Fortunately they were willing to take it back and we exchanged for another brand.  Get an iPod if you can afford it-get any other MP3.  Stay away from this it is awful!

Title: Great Camera
Content:
For a new user diving into the world of SLR , I think this is probably the best buy I could have made.I am using the kit lens as well as a 70-300 and the pictures are clear and very sharp.The Stabilisation on the body also helps when using in low light and telephoto. ALL IN ALL , A GREAT BUY !

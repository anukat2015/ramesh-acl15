Title: Vornado lives up to its promise
Content:
My Vornado model VH2, made in the USA, is quiet, effective, and sits on the floor with stability. The controls are top mounted and intuitive. The owner's manual states that is is easy to clean with a shop vac thru the vent holes and it appears that will work. It sells for a few dollars more than the cheap imported models that rattle when shaken.

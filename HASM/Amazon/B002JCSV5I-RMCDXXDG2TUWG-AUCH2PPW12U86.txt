Title: D3000 vs D5000
Content:
I was new to dSLR world and after a lot of research, got myself a Nikon D3000. Nikon vs Canon was a very easy choice and I thought D3000 was way better than Canon Rebel XS due to more AF points, guide mode etc. to name a few features.
D3000 was good but somehow it lacked in low light photography. Also, it felt crippled when i tried on new things while learning to use it. After a careful thought, I exchanged it for D5000 and boy, how happy am I that I did it. D5000 blows D3000 right out of the window. The most amazing thing is the Scene mode which allows me to choose from 20 preset scene mode. This alone saves a lot of effort for an newcomer like me. Also, the night/indoor snaps are way better.
D5000 has a better sensor (12.1 MP CMOS) and has a better efficiancy too. 
Long story short, buy D3000 if you won't fiddle much with your camera as its definitely not bad but if you want to gradually move up the learning curve and indulge in serious photography, D5000 is for you.

Title: An iDisappointment
Content:
I've been a Mac user for years, and so it's disappointing to be so frustrated with the new iBook I purchased with the 2 OS's, 9.2 and X .1.  One problem is physical: the case pops open when I close it; it is also too small and heavy compared to other computers I've used (such as my Gateway Solo - and this from a PC hater.)  The OS X is still far from being very useful for some things: Palm use, for one: you have to either switch back to "Classic" (OS 9) mode to hot sync or else follow Apple support's advice and download the current Palm beta version for OS X, which failed to function and so as a result, I've had to resort to using my old Powerbook G3 for the Palm.  There are other problems with OS X in terms of design and practicality, and again, it hurts this old Apple fan to say that Microsoft's XP actually functions in a more friendly fashion in many respects (though IT does some downright psychotic things at times, which is what prompted me to buy the iBook in the first place.  Basically, they both fail to work the way they ought to.) Though I'm sure the iBook is a "fine machine" in many respects, when I compare my experience of using it with what I expected, in terms of quality and ease of use, I'm very disappointed.  And to top it off, since it's a "custom configuration" (what computer that you buy isn't a "custom configuration" anymore???) the Apple Store now tells me that I had only ten days to decide I wanted a refund.  So, I'm stuck with it.  My suggestion: stick with your old Mac or whatever, or just paper and pen and a paper Franklin Planner - your life will be much easier, and you'll save two grand (what the "$1,100" iBook will actually cost you, minimal, once you "custom configure" it and buy all the new OS X software you'll need.)

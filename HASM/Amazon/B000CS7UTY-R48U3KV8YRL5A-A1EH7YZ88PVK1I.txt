Title: Great player overall
Content:
this is a great product from creative. i just upgraded from a player with only 512mb. The battery life is great, and the screen is fabulous especially if you are going to watch videos. The downside of the player is that you need the extra adapter that comes with the player to charge up. I wish creative would have had the internal USB port rather than me carrying the usb cable and the adapter. The screen is a bit smaller than the ipod, but i don't watch many videos anyway so it didn't really matter. Also, it's thicker than the ipod by a bit. But in general, it's a pretty good player that is easy to carry around and its price is comparable or even lower than the ipod.

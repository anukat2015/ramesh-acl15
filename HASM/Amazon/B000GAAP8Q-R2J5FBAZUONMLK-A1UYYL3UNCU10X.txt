Title: Love it except...
Content:
I got my ipod nano for mothers day less than a month ago. I thought it was great except when it froze up. Looks like I'm not the only one who experienced this inconvenience. If there was an instruction book, I'd have been somewhat comforted. I had to use trial and error and finally reset it by holding down the top two buttons. Which then erased all my stuff and I had to set it all up again. Last night, when it got stuck, I tried this trick again and my stuff was still there. Makes me nervous with an item that was not (imo) cheap. I also have trouble turning it off. Again, an instruction booklet would have been helpful. I think you need to pause whatever you're listening to and then go back to the beginning screen and then hold down the bottom button. At least that worked last time. Otherwise, it's a great little invention.

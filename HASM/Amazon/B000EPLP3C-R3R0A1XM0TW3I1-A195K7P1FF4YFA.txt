Title: Stuck with it
Content:
I got this as a gift for someone. I first brought one for my sister when they first came out and she had no problems with it but this time around the one I purchased off of Amazon seemed to shut off on its on while playing. I sent in for a replacement and the replacement wouldn't even turn on so instead of returning the first one with "auto shut-off" I had to send in the replacement. Now my friend is stuck with a zune that works sometimes when it wants to.-Thanks Amazon

Content:
My Dream Coffee Maker keeps coffee hot but not burnt, this one keeps the coffee @ 180F (160F in the cup w/cream) and burns it along with your mouth. if you are going to consume the coffee within 15 minutes this one is EXCELLENT, otherwise it's going to taste BURNT. if only it has a thermostat.

Title: Replaced My PDA
Content:
This is a great replacement for my PDA. It syncs beautifully with my iMac. All of my iCal calendar entries and address book contacts are there, and I can add, delete or edit them from the iPod touch and they sync on the computer. The fact that I can go online wherever there is wifi is fantastic! Apple just started selling a software upgrade that adds a mail program, notes, widgets (weather, stocks, maps, etc.) and more  for $19.99. It also makes the screen customizable! It's everything the iphone has except the phone! It's worth it for the e-mail program alone... SO much easier than trying to read web-mail on this size screen. (Oh, yeah... and it plays music and videos, too!) Not as much memory as my video ipod, but I just make a file of my favorite music and it syncs to my ipod touch. AND it was a great price on Amazon... I'm very happy with this purchase.

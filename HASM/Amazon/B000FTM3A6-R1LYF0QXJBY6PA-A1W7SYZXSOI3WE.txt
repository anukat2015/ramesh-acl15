Title: Do not waste your money
Content:
If it keeps coffee warm for 'hours' - it must be a max of 2, and that is when the temp is 100 degrees!  I do not know how they measure cups - but this coffee pot does NOT make 8 cups of coffee - or my measuring cup is not calibrated properly.  And - heaven forbid - you do not put the pot in exactly the right spot when you turn it on (then go to take your morning shower).  Upon your return, you will find such a mess all over your counter.  I paid so much money for this disaster, I keep trying to learn to live with it - but think I will go back to my old coffee maker that only costs less than $20.  Had to replace it every 18 months of so - but I now find that was a pleasure.

Title: I want my own!
Content:
My daughter had a 3rd gen nano that I gave her when I changed up to the 4th gen. For Christmas this year, I got both my teens their first 'completely new not handed down from me when I upgraded' ipods. She's 14 and opted for the 8g Nano. 
I love that when Apple puts out a new generation it is new with new capabilities. She can watch her crafty podcasts on it, listen to music and make little movies. It's all been very intuitive and easy for her to learn to use.
The mic on it means she can keep notes when we shop or when she's working on something and she likes being able to play things out loud without having to plug it into speakers when she just wants to watch a podcast without using the headphones. 
It's the same size and shape as the 4th gen nano so it's perfectly sized for the gym with the right case. Another great product, and at a great price.

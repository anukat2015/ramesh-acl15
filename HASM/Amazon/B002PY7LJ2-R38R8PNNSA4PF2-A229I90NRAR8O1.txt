Title: My first labtop
Content:
I bought Gateway because I have in the past.  I currently just but a new hard drive by gateway and love it.  The notebook is perfect for me. The 11.6 screen is the perfect size for my small office area and for traveling.  I do not need a cd because I have a burner at home.  It took me a while to regiser my programs, but it was easy enough without the cd capability, all the registrations #s are on you purchased programs.  I am still learning to type on it. It has flat buttons and it is a little strange.  I am getting use to it though.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I bought a skin to go over it to prevent scratching and it is really cool.  Runs at a good speed.  I am going to purchase the extra 2 gb.  I take a lot of pictures when away. I haven't used it long enough to rate the battery life.  Will have to get back to you on that subject.

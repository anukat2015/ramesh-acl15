Title: Awesome coffee!
Content:
I bought the Cusinart coffee maker to replace our old one, and decided to get the Cusinart brand, since I have other appliances from Cusinart, and love them all...I love this coffee maker!  It not only looks great, but makes the best tasting coffee I've ever had!  I love the 1-4 cup feature!  Other reviewers noted how difficult taking the lid off the carafe, but it really wasn't!  It was noted in the manual how to take it off, and it came off easily!  I can't say enough about the DCC-1200...automatic off...self cleaning function, beautiful black and stainless steel, retro look to it. Awesome product!

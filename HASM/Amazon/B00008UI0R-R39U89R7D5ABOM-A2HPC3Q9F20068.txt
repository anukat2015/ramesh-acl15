Title: Great little vac
Content:
This is a great little vacuum!  I wanted a bagless vac, but not an upright-and this is it!  I can get under the beds and couch easily.  It is light and easy to carry up the steps.  Not as noisy as my old bagless upright.  The attachments are great.  I have hardwood floors, and it does a great job on them.  I would buy it again.  The canister is small so needs to be emptied each time I vac the entire house, but that's ok-it easy, and if the canister was bigger it wouldn't be the nice compact vac that it is.  I have had mine for about 8 months now.  No problems so far!  You can clean the canister filter which is great, but I would recommend buying an extra filter you can use while you clean the other.  
A definate keeper!  I love mine!

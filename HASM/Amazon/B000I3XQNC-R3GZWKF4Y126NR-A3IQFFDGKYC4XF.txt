Title: Good place to start
Content:
I'm no expert in the SLR arena but this camera is easy to use, small and light. I've taken about 1000 pictures in the first month or so that I've had it. Already I've noticed the limitations of the kit lens and am looking for my first opportunity to buy a nice sharp lens (possibly a prime). However, as far as the camera body goes, I think it will last me a long time. All controls seem pretty straightforward. The only setting that seems to me a little difficult to change (considering how often it needs to be changed) is the white balance. If this is an issue for you get a big memory card to take your pictures in RAW (12Mb per image).

Title: WOW!
Content:
I mean, wow!  For almost two years we have been implanting these cat hair on the carpet for a reason!  But behold, this gizmo thingy, like totally negated everything we have done and sucked everything out in 50 seconds.  I am disheartened and sad, but also happy 'cause I got a [great] vacuum cleaner!  This thing works, folks, make no mistake about it, this thing sucks out everything you (or your partying friends) put in the apartment carpet.  Not only that! It actually stopped sucking the paper clip I stole from work, like giving me a second chance!  I know, you probably think I am whimp trying to get by stealing a box of paper-clips...but you haven't met my boss yet...No...In all sincerity, this vacuum cleaner (did I spell that right?) is a gem (it actually tugged me along to get to work...is that thing some sort of a self-propelled workaholic or am I in the dark here?), it really did clean up Crystal's (uh...that's my cat) hair, and deposited in this nice little canister thingamajiggy that I took out and shook off and went on with my life.  And you know what?  They actually gave me 2 extra filter thingies (I am positive that the one that is already 'in' the machine is the same thing), so I don't have to worry about re-ordering...Now, I am sure there is a catch. I am not sure from where or when it's coming...probably the belt is too expensive and it breaks in 2 weeks or something like that...but for [the price]???  I'd kiss bush!..Peace!

Title: Don't Do It
Content:
I bought this in the middle of Oct of 07 in prep for the winter. Before i turned on the furnace for the year i tried using this heater to heat my computer room since that is where most of our time is spent. We were previously using a small (about a 1 ft cube) hot air blowing space heater that sadly does a much better job heating the room than this panel heater. I can have this unit sitting 6 inches behind my chair while at my desk and I'll STILL be cold. I left it on for a week straight thinking it may just need some time to heat the "stuff" in the room. It didn't work that way.
I tried to see if there really was a need for the unit to be on. I didn't know if there was a certain temperature that this would work best at so i turned on the furnace and set it to 61 so it would only kick on when actually necessary. The thermostat is in the computer room and the panel unit was about 4 feet from the thermostat and my furnace still turned on.
I unplugged it and turned on the small space heater. The room warmed up and the furnace didn't turn back on after 2 1/2 hrs.
It's the first week of Nov '07 and it's going back. If it can't handle fall it surely won't man up in winter.
Don't buy this heater.

Title: Amazing Camera--Amazing Price--LAST YEAR!
Content:
I bought this camera for my husband last December (2008) and only paid $718.00.  I cannot believe the price NOW!  Wow!  Did I get a good deal or what????  It takes great pictures and blurs the background when they are processed.  Pay some extra money to get your pics from a real photo lab (no, Walmart does not count).  We had some professional pictures done two years ago and spent over $800.  We did our own this year and they turned out just as good, if not better and we can order as many as we want and took over 1,000 pictures during our photo shoot.  The camera has paid for itself and we plan on doing family pictures every spring and fall now that we have a good camera.  It truly is a great camera.  One thing to be aware of...you cannot VIEW subjects on the LCD screen when you take the picture.  Something I wasn't aware of until I bought it, but you get used to it and professional photographers will tell you to NEVER use that view anyway.  Just use the viewfinder.

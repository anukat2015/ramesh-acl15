Title: Wonderful
Content:
I recently purchase this camera and so far took about 500 pictures. Outstanding results. It does it all. I also purchase the 40-200 zoom. My most impressive moment was the day I took a picture of the Moon, just by holding the camera and the 40-200 zoom in my hands (no tripod), in all automatic setting and click, that's it; and to my greatest surprise, I clearly could see the craters and seas at the surface of the Moon! Really impressive. Yet the camera is not over bulky and the screen is fully adjustable. This camera is intelligent and can give you the best even if you are a camera-idiot, yet it is fully manual if you have the skills and want to do more. No movies, this is a tool dedicated exclusively to taking pictures, great pictures.

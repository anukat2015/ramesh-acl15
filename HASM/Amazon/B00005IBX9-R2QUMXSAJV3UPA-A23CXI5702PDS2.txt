Title: Some great features and design, but not perfect
Content:
Love the look (although quite large, but what in U.S. isn't?) and the auto on/off features.  You can customize the auto off which is nice.  It does not have the outside clear measure so you know how much water is being poured in.  For smaller pots you have to pour the water into the pot first for accurate amounts - which is a big drag and just one more step in the morning.  I bought this coffee maker in hopes that I would finally get a HOT cup of coffee without having to microwave (it has temp settings, mine is on high) - but it doesn't come close- still have to microwave. Otherwise a good tasting cup of coffee.

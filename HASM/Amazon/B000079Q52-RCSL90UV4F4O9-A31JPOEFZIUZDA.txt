Title: Soleus Air Reflective Heater MS-10R
Content:
The Soleus Air reflective heater is a good product overall.  It does a very good job compared to heaters of higher wattage that cost more to operate.  I like being able to select between it's two heat settings, high and low, and the adjustable timer which is a real energy saver and safety feature.  The oscillation feature enables the Soleus Air MS-10R to heat a larger area which is nice also.  Its great for daytime use or wherever you don't mind a little extra light but the heating element gives off too much light for sleeping areas.  Otherwise, I am well satisfied with this product.

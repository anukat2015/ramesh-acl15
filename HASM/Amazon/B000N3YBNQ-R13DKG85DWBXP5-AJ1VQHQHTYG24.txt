Title: Great vacuum!
Content:
This is a great little vacuum. We live in a small house where storage is tight and this vacuum can live happily under my bed. We also have two pets, one who sheds quite a lot. The vacuum gets up all the pet hair.  
The only downfall is that the vacuum has so much suction, that for smaller rugs, it will suck the whole thing up, so you have to stand on the corners while you vacuum, but its not that big of a deal.

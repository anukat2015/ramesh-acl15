Title: Hoover S3765 - Windtunnel Elec.Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
I am very pleased with this vacuum - I read a gazillion reviews before I purchased, and based on some of the negative comments about this vac, I hesitated - but someone I know had one and was happy - so I bought it - I am very pleased - now problem whatsoever - and it sucks very well - I would definitely recommend it - particularly if you have a lot of hardwood floors like I do - I mostly use the floor brush on the floors - and the powerhead for my carpets only -

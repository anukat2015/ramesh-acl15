Title: Bad Value
Content:
To whom this may concern,
My two sons and I purchased this computer, the HP TouchSmart 300-1003 Desktop PC, as a gift for my wife on Christmas day 2009. The machine worked great for the first couple of months and she loved it. However, around mid February it began to have a problem where it would shut off suddenly after about 15 to 20 minutes of use. In order to turn in back on the user would have to unplug the computer then plug it back in and turn the machine on and the result would be only about 10 - 15 minutes of use.
I called the HP support number and the technician was unable to find a "problem code" that pin pointed the problem. The solution was reached that HP would send a box under the warranty and have it shipped to Jeffersonville, IN to be repaired. This was of course after they told me I had no other option to take it somewhere closer. After about a week, including the pick-up at my door and the receiving of the finished work, we hooked the computer up and started it back up. In the mean time I was reading the long list of all repairs made and I looked up and the computer had shut off - problem not fixed.
I called the tech support again and was put on hold for quite a long time and bounced to a few different departments. I got a technician who told me they would have to get the computer shipped back out again for repairs or he said I could take it to a Best Buy or Staples for repair, something a previous tech said I could not do.
In my opinion this computer is not a great value and I have yet to get knowledgeable technical support from HP. The service they provide for correcting the problem is sluggish.

Title: Excellent suction, good build quality, poor buttons
Content:
Just received it today and tested it out on our floor and carpet. I was amazed when I looked at how much dirt/dust was in the canister after just one usage. The adjustable power level is nice to have, the attachments seem good (there are 5 total), and the retractable cord works perfectly. It seems to clean edges well. too. I can't wait to clean my cars with it. So far, I'm satisfied. I just hope the buttons on the handle don't break. Luckily we don't vacuum that often.
UPDATE:
=======
This thing is unbelievable. The suction power is crazy. When you empty the canister and clean the filter, you just can't believe how much dust and dirt it traps in there. I'm completely satisfied.

Title: Great price, basic computer, very satisfied
Content:
I got this notebook several months ago and I've had a great experience with it. I've had zero problems with it, and I'm very pleased with Vista as well. The one thing I would change about it is that mine takes it's sweet time booting up when I turn it on. Once it's all ready to go, however, it runs very fast. I'm sure that's something I could help by changing some settings, but it's the only negative thing I have to say about this computer. I have The Sims 2 Deluxe on here, and am very pleased with how fast the game runs on this notebook. I've had absolutely no problems with the computer handling any software I've added.
We got it for a great price! And if you just need a basic, good computer, this is a good one to go with. It would be especially good for a student.

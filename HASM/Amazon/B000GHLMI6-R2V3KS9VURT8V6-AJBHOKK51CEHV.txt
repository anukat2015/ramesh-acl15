Title: Best coffee maker in the universe
Content:
Our household consists of two coffee lovers, we make at least two pots per day.  We have been through our share of coffee pots and finally received this one as a gift.  [Ours is the older model as it is about five years old, the only complaint I have about that model is that it isn't programmable. . .well this one is so we're getting it.]  This is the ONLY coffee maker to last us more than a couple of months, I will NEVER get another kind.  Plus, the one hand dispenser is unbeatable.  GET THIS COFFEE MAKER!!!

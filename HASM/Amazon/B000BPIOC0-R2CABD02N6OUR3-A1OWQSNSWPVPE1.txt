Title: Wonderful area heater
Content:
I have used these small heaters in my bathroom for years...Ive tried Pelonis, Holmes and Honeywell...My favorite is Pelonis unfortunately I cannot find them anymore..The Pelonis heater has worked for years but only because I've taken better care of it than I did the Holmes heater..  TIP ***Use your blow dryer to blow out lint often and a very long soft brush to keep vents clear of lint.....This will help heater to have a much longer life ...I found that on all of the above brand heaters, they will shut off when using HI HEAT setting but on medium setting they will run for hours and heat will flow into the next room...In the winter mine will remain on for hours providing inexpensive warmth*****Make sure lint does not build up and they are well ventillated****

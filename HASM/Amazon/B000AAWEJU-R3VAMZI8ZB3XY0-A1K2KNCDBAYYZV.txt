Title: Just Wonderful!
Content:
I purchased this machine over the summer this year.   I am so pleased with the product.   It was a welcome relief from the GE I purchased not 2 months before I bought this one.   I have been using it for several months.  It is light weight, which is great for moving it up and down stairs.   The suction on this machine is also incredible.   It only takes  a few minutes to clean each of the floors on my hard wood surfaces.   It also gets up pet hair out of carpet.    You don't need to go over the same spot twice.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like a canister machine over the upright.

Title: Not powerful enough
Content:
2 problems
1. the fan is loud.  It is annoying if placed in a family rooom with a TV.  or an office with a computer.  Too loud.  
2. Not powerful enough.  We were looking for a portable heater to heat a family room.  This heater is not powerful enough for our purposes. 
If you have a small, i.e. 9 ft by 9ft closed space, it works.  If you have a bigger, 15 ft by 20ft type family room, it really has little effect.   
We were disappointed in the actual benefit.  We may purchase an oil based heater next winter to see if that works better, quieter and more effective in heating.

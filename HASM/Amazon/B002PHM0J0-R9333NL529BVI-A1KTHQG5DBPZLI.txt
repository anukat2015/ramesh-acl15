Title: Good design
Content:
It's design is very good. Keyboards labeled welll, usb poprts located well. And it seems thinner than what it is because of its design. 
There is also a web button that enable you to launch internet w/o starting windows. when you press that button it turns on/off in seconds. wooww
So far so good..

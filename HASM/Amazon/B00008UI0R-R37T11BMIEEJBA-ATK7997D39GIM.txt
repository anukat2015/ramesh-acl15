Title: This Thing Really Sucks!
Content:
Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum
I purchased this after our last canister vac bit the dust. FTR, we own a cat and a dog (traditional shedding variety not one of these fancy whateverdoodles) This model appears to be very well built, has electronically variable suction/motor speed and a bevy of useful attachments including a small power head for stairs or furniture. The larger carpeting power head feels like it could drag you across the room if you did not pay attention. We went over some carpets previously vacuumed with another machine and were surprised by how much additional dirt and pet hair came up. Even on low power, which is extremely quiet, this thing runs circles around our old machine. 
In short, recommend this unit highly for value and performance.

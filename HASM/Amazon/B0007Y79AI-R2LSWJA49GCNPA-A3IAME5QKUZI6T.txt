Title: What tha......Can't Believe It
Content:
Man I have been wanting a nano for a minute and today I finally broke down and brought the black 2 GB Nano. I have second generation  6 GB iPod Mini Green but technology moves on she has served me well and plus the mini's plain grey and blue backlit lcd was getting tired she will be retired. I picked the 2 GB Nano because I realized that when i had the 6 GB mini i didn't even listen to half the songs on there so i said 500 songs  is enough for me. The Nano is sooooo tight it's so light and thin it feels kinda flimsy but I will get a thick case for it. The fancy  case that comes with it is not strong enough to protect it in my pocket. I'm also kinda upset that it does not sync via firewire like my ipod mini it needs usb 2.0 but oh well my 500 Mhz iBook's usb 1.1 worked just as good. It took about 9 minutes or so to  sync some songs from itunes  not that bad some people complained to death about how slow usb 1.1 is but it really is not that terrible. In conclusion Im satisfied with my Nano

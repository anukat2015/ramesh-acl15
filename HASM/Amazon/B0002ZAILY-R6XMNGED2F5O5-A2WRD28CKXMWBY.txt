Title: Easy iPod
Content:
This easy to use on the go iPod shuffle is great for those on the go. The neck strap is great for outdoor activities and you don't have to worry about holding it in your hand or falling off some belt clip. The newer version, though smaller, doesnt have the handy neck strap. Yes, the more advanced iPods have screens that display the songs and show you the functions but if you work outdoors or use it for various tastks you dont have to worry about the screen falling and breaking. This iPod is very durable and the battery lasts for days. Great value for the money. Very happy with this iPod.

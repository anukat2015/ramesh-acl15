Title: Several design problems
Content:
I'm going on to my third example of this coffee maker and have used it since it was introduced to rave reviews several years ago. 
It's the best coffemaker I've owned. What this actually means is that there are some truly horrendous products available and this is the least bad of the bunch.
 It does have several design flaws.
Small, poorly located water resevoir opening with a difficult to see level indicator.
No backlight on the clock which is more of a hassle than you may think.
The height restricts placement and can cause difficulty in filling with water and coffee.
The carafe which is supposed to be no-drip certainly is not.
The switch on the hotplate is prone to damage when the basket overflows (which it will).
The are a few more issues a little too trivial to be mentioned here.
I will say again that this is the best coffee maker I've found out there. I intend to replace my floundering(it shuts off immediately after brewing)one with a new one.
With all the feedback available in this review section, if the manufacturer doesn't produce the world's best coffee maker next model cycle it would be a horribly wasted opportunity on their part.

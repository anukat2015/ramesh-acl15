Title: Love this thing!
Content:
After repeatedly duct-taping, and repairing electrical connections, in my 10-year-old Sears canister, I saw this Electrolux in an email ad from Costco. Did some research, then said, 'Aw, what the hell, it's easy to return stuff to Costco', and ordered it. Great decision. Example: I used to change the bag in my Kenmore oh, maybe every two months. The electrolux pulls up so much stuff, I empty it twice a week! Luckily, that's a one-minute operation, no big deal at all, and, of course, no bags to buy. And in spite of the fact that the old Kenmore was a 'quiet' model, I'd guess that the Electrolux is what, half as noisy? I'm very noise-sensitive (I've been known to use noise-reduction headphones while vacuuming), and the Electrolux is about as quiet as I can imagine a vacuum being; not at all bothersome.
Complaints? Well, it would be nice if the power cord was about 8 feet longer than it is; I have to change outlets more often than I used to. And, while one of the nice features is that the dusting attachment snaps right onto the hose handle, it's not a very secure attachment, and the dusting attachment frequently falls off. End of complaints. 
Would I buy it again? In a hot second. Highly recommended.

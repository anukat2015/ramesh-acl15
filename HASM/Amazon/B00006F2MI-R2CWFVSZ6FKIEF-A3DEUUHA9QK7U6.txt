Title: Not my Idea of a coffee maker
Content:
Others before me have written about the poor points of this brewer.  Neither my wife or I are mechanically inept, but, we never did get this thing to make a cup of coffee.  Yes, we filled with water, plugged in, set time/date ground coffee read instructions umpteen times, closed doors 45 minutes later still no coffee. reboxed and going back asap.
Looks great, works lousey.

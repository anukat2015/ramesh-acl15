Title: USED the warranty BIG TIME
Content:
I bought this coffee maker 3 years ago, and it malfunctioned two times.  The first time we returned it and received a new one from the company.  This past time it just died one day, and when we returned it they said that it was now out of warranty, and that they had not received it yet.  So, now I am looking to Consumer Reports for a new one.  They rated this particular model VERY LOW.  We enjoyed it when it worked, but will not buy it again due to reliability.

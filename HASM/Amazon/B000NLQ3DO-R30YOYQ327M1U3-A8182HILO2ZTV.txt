Title: Do not buy Mr. Coffee
Content:
I am now on the 2nd ISX43 coffee maker in less than 6 months.  I had the 1st one and used it less than 10 times before the water completely leaked out the bottom while pouring it in.  Mr. Coffee sent me a new one.  In 3 weeks time, using it 2 times a week, the second one started doing the exact same thing.  I called and they said they would send me another one.  I asked if they would like to see the old one to see what was wrong.  They said no.  I said am I the only one that has this problem.  The "gentleman" stated that since he has worked for Mr. Coffee for 4 years that of course he has seen coffee pots leak.  I felt he was being rude.
I took the bottom off the maker and discovered that the cheap glue that they use to attach the hoses to a tube comes unglued and there fore causes it to come apart and leak.  Really poor design.  Really poor company that doesn't care and really poor customer service.

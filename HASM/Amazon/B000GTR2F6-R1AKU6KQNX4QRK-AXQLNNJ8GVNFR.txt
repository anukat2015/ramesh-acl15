Title: Coffee Maker Great, K-Cups expensive
Content:
My wife and I drink different kinds of coffee so this works well for us. A lot less mess and a lot more convenience.  We have the timer set so the Keurig is ready to brew when we get up in the morning and keep it working throughout the day. We have had one bad K-Cup out of several hundred but they are expensive compared to ground coffee.  They are really cheap compared to a coffee house, however. 
You can get hot water from it for tea bags or cocoa mix which is also very handy. The instructions tell you to rinse it once after using the Cocoa K-Cups so we just use the package mix which is a lot faster and easier.  Keep a container handy to fill the reservoir without removing it from the machine because it is heavy and awkward to move and replace.  Because of the need to get to the reservoir, the machine needs to sit on counter space in front of the cabinets.

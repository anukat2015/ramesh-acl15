Title: Don't buy a Panasonic
Content:
Purchased a Panasonic MC-CG 973 vacuum in 2008.  Just before the warranty expired, the vacuum would not turn off unless I unplugged it.  Switch would not work.  I contacted Panasonic and was give a repair dealer in Pa.....I live in NJ.  I could not get the vacuum into the repair shop until the following month.  Since the warranty expired by then, Panasonic wouldn't extend and I had to pay for a new power hose.
Panasonic service stinks (not to mention I was on hold for 8 minutes).  Power hoses should not be breaking after less than 1 yrs. use.  This vacuum was not abused.
This was the second vacuum I purchased from Panasonic......I won't purchase another.

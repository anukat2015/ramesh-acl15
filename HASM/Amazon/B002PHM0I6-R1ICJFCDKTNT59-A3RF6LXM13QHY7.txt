Title: sony vaio cw JUNK!!!!
Content:
I purchased this laptop for christmas and hated it the minute it came out the box.  It is made of really cheap plastic that is very glossy and constantly needs to be wiped.  My kids computer looks better than this one,  this looks like a toy.  Sound is horrible very cheap speakers.  Boot up time was slow.  Sony customer service is horrible, I sent it back and waited 1 month for a refund because Sony only gives credit card refunds once a month; which is ridiculus; and still did not get a refund after repeated calling and emails.  I am still waiting for a refund or response other than they do not know why I have not recieved a refund.  The customer service representatives barely speak english and are very difficult to understand and are not helpful at all.  I am still waiting for some answer to when I will get my money back.  I definitly suggest anyone to shop another brand, Toshiba is great with great customer service.

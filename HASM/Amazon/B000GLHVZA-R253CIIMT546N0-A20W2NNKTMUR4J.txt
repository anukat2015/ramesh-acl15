Title: Does not heat anything
Content:
Purchased this for my basement. In a 50x50 room it did not increase the temperature after several hours by even 1 degree. My clock gives me the indoor and outdoor temperature and yes I even tried moving it.
This week I had a slight water leak in my basement. I placed this heater on the maximum settings next to the water on the carpet for several hours. No change!
I also have a regular Vornado fan and it's already broken since it's made out of cheap plastic. It barely moves the air and doesn't help at all.
Vornado products are way overpriced. 
Believe it or not I went and purchased a cheap metal heater for fifteen dollars and it's way better. I feel MUCH safer with it on as well.
I'm glad it works so well for many. It just doesn't for me. Save your receipt just in case!

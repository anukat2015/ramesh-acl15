Title: Good overall with Pros & Cons
Content:
Nice MP3 player, but below are my pros & cons....
PROS:
Small, lightweight, lots of features, nice looking (silver color choice), radio works good, has internal speaker, pretty fast uploading songs onto it. Overall you get your money's worth.
CONS:
Too fragile because it's very thin (may bend & break too easily). I bought a separate hard case for it to protect it and strongly recommend you do the same.
The headphones that come with it don't sound good, so you'll end up buying different ones after you compare a few. Also the battery life is too short. I don't find the video feature to be very useful, I would have preferred to do without that in exchange for better headphones or larger disk space, but that's just me.

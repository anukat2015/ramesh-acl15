Title: Don't purchase this brand
Content:
I bought this coffee maker in the store and I'm really surprised at how poor the design is.  If you don't put the basket in it at exactly the right angle, the coffee doesn't drip down while brewing.  It sits in the basket.  Also, the top of the coffee maker is difficult to close.  I have another coffee maker that has worked for 3 years wihtout an issue by Braun.  I wanted to get a new one just because I thought it was time.  This one is no where near as well-made as the Braun coffee maker.

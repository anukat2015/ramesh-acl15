Title: Sony 350 pic quality
Content:
First let me say I did not purchase this from Amazon (a first for me since I purchase everything from here). I did find a better deal at Circuit City BUT  I would NOT recommend buying from there again. Very lousy customer service and little sales knowledge of product. Luckily I did some research before going there.
   Now about the camera. I LOVED all the features and the ease of operation. I loved the focusing and the best feature I found to be the LCD screen that tilts allowing you to view images while holding camera above you or taking low shots. 
   What I did not like was the lack of picture quality. I found the pictures to be VERY blurry and not in focus. I tried manual focusing and auto focusing. I tried to make sure the camera had no movement when shooting. I tried everything. Out of the 200 or so shots I took with it I can say that only 10 or 15 came out acceptable. I love close up photography of flowers & insects, I couldn't do it with this camera. 
I really wanted this camera but the image just made it unacceptable.

Title: Could not have been a better choice
Content:
If there's only one person drinking coffee in the household, this is probably one of the best choices you can make.  It's easy and fast to use.  It does not require a coffee filter, but I prefer to use it with the MELITTA PA1-40NB BR CONE Filter.  I've been using the coffee machine now for a couple of months without any issues.

Title: Nice heater, but fan does not blow heat far enough.
Content:
This is a nice heater, with very nice features.  I will say that it will heat a small to midsized room well.  But for the larger room I bought it for, I expected the fan and oscillation to blow heat a little farther than it does.  You will not feel heat coming directly from this heater when more than a couple feet away.  Don't get me wrong it will eventually heat the room, but if you are looking for something that will blow the heat on you when sitting on the couch... buy another heater.  We purchased several of the:  Lasko tower heaters with MUCH better success.  Lasko 751320 Ceramic Tower Heater with Remote Control .  These thing s blow out much better heat and even though they are not off the ground like this heater, they do more than enough heating from about 4 feet away to warm the couch where we sit on cold nights and relax.

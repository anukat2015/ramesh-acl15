Title: Great Coffee from a Great Machine
Content:
I don't know why there are so many bad reviews on this wonderful coffee maker! I recieved this as a gift from my Mom a couple years ago and I have never had a single problem with it. To clear up some things other reviews said; 
-you can get the water filters for $2.50 online now...so that isn't a big deal
-if you have problems pouring the coffee out it is because you can't read, just aline one big arrow with the other big arrow and BAM you have coffee pouring perfectly. If you don't line up the arrows it only partially comes out or comes out the top, your problem not the machine's lol 
-I also agree with the fact that you have to use good coffee beans to get good tasting coffee, if you use preground crap from the market then it probably will still taste like crap! 
So I love this coffeemaker, no problems at all if you know how to use it and take the time to read!

Title: 4 1/2 stars for a good product
Content:
This is an outstanding computer, especially for its features and operating system functions.  My gripe with it is that the 5400 rpm hard drive is a major lagging player and does not unleash the full potential of your MBP.  I would get a new one - 7200 rpm - but doing so is a major pain and you could easily void the warranty.  Otherwise, everything is working just fine.
I suggest you get the AppleCare protection plan as you might need it to protect your your (expensive) MBP.  I got it for 200 at e bay.
You can get many free applications, including NeoOffice or OpenOffice (replaces MS office).
Good luck!

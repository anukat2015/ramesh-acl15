Title: My Wife loves her Pink Zune!
Content:
My wife had been using her phone as an MP3 player, however it does not deliver the capacity or flexibility as the Zune player does.  Ever since I gave it to her for Christmas, she has been using it in the car by hooking it to an FM transmitter, and using it when she works out... she loves it.  The nice thing about the Zune, compared to an iPOD, is that when you copy music to it, it's in mp3 format and it doesn't take expensive software to convert the music back to regular audio format.  The iTunes software for the iPOD converts the music to a special format that requires expensive software to convert it back...  It's so much easier to use the Zune... We both have one and love it!!!

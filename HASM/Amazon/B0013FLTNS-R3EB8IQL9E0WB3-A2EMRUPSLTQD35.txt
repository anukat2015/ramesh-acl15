Title: Great computer!
Content:
So far we really love this computer.  We have a wireless Internet and printer connection and they both work beautifully. Strong signal.  The only negative I can think of is I like the glassy screen better than the mat finish which this model has.  We have an iMac with the glass screen and it is so much clearer and brighter.  But other than that, this Macbook Pro does everything we need it to do.

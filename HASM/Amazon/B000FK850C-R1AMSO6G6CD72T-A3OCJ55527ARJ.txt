Title: Excellent, convenient size, warms the room well
Content:
This is an excellent heater -- it warms up my home office extremely quickly and keeps a consistent temperature when set to automatic. As one of the other reviewers said: the remote control seems like an extravagance at first but it is so convenient that it has quickly become something I use all the time. It takes up almost no floor space at all and there's no risk of my dog burning itself on the heater. All in all, couldn't be happier!

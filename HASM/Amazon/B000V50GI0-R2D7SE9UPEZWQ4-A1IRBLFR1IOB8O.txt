Title: Small But Slow and Steady
Content:
I bought this knowing that I would be without heat for a week while my furnance was worked over, (I am in Florida so don't be too concerned).
It will heat a 14x18 room just fine if you give it a few hours and the temps are not below freezing.
Regarding the smells others have mentioned, niether my wife or myself or at least 6 visitors have noticed anything.  It does make some noise but so does by furnance!

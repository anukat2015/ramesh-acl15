Title: Heat dissipates to the ceiling.
Content:
I bought a Kenwood oil filled electric room heater 6708EP at one of those popular home improvement huge stores. The heater has slits on top where warm air dissipates right up to the ceiling.  I bought it to warm my small bedroom.  It failed to warm my bedroom to 70 degrees at full power for 8 hours. It would work better if it had a fan inside and the slits were around the device, not just on top.

Title: Nikon D200 Review (to replace D100)
Content:
I was completely delighted with the D200.  The controls are more intuitive, accessible than the D100.  The main reason for upgrading is the difficulty I was having slaveing SB800 and SB600 flash units off the built in flash on the D100.  Its a snap with the D200.  Also, the auto ISO feature has been great by allowing me to quickly take photos in low light without a flash. I'm glad for the option of JPEG+raw.  
A few negatives:  Its noticeably heavier (take it hiking a lot) but I assume (I hope) more rugged.  Of course, its pretty pricey but now I'm glad I went for it.

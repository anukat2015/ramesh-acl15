Title: Not Made to Last
Content:
Like most other viewers here. I bought this heater because it was quite and energy efficient. After 6 months of use it started to heatup to 80+ degrees. I didn't notice this till I woke up one morning sweating. Iturned it down unplugged it and it worked well for a few more weeks. It now doesn't do anything. It turns on displays an incorrect temperature and doesn't heat.

Title: The Creative Zen Nano Plus Rocks!
Content:
The Creative Zen Nano Plus MP3 player is very small, not much bigger than a cigarette lighter, but it delivers great sound. From music to audio books, this little gem will not disappoint, especially for the price. The only con is that the battery doesn't charge from the USB port from what I've read, but you can buy rechargeable batteries and a battery charger or an ac adapter.

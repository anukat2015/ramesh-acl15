Title: Not rugged at all
Content:
I bought one of these computers and it lost 2 keys.  They don't easily go back on (extremely poor design) so it becomes quite a issue.  This is the third HP that I've had problems with i my direct family and two of those three involved keys popping off.  It's just not as rugged as a laptop needs to be.  I've used other brands with no issues.  Too bad too, the performance otherwise is OK.

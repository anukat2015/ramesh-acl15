Title: Only for wood floors
Content:
I have no idea how this gets good reviews.  I am starting to think that all these reviews are fake.  I am not angry that I bought this vacuum, I am angry that I followed these reviews. 
Simply put this vacuum does NOT work on carpets (at least not Persian Rugs).  You have to pick up the head off the carpet, put it down ahead of you, and then pull it back.  You can't push it on the carpet.
I have used many, many, vacuums and honestly I have no idea which one picked up more dirt (I am a guy and don;t really care), but they all were generally the same when it came to pushing them around.

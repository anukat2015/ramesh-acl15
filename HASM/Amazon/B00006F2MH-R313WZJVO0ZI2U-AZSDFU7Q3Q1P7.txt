Title: Once you go grind and brew..you never go back!!![.]
Content:
Come on with the complaints on washing it!  It doesn't make a hill of beans (get it) ; )  compared to the quality of coffee this baby makes.  I buy the Dunkin Donuts coffee beans and it is like being at Dunkin Donuts.  I would say not to use the filter..use the paper filters.  This is my second grind and brew and I am as hooked on the coffee maker as much as I'm hooked on coffee.  Enjoy!

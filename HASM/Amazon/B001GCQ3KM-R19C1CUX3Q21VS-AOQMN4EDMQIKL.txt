Title: will not buy another fuze... might buy another sansa (still will never become an itard)
Content:
One warranty exchange later and I am still displeased: video lockup.  This is ironic given that sansa fuze can play only one format/container with apparent secret properties that can only be transcoded by their respective proprietary bloatware.   This minimalist, masochistic addition to claim "video" as a feature.  Yeah, right.  Thanks?
Why not use a standard USB cable?  More torture: the fuze has a proprietary connection.  
As mine is a version two device sadly rockbox firmware *upgrade* is out of the question.
It handles my extensive FLAC collection nicely.  I shall be looking for the next PMP (Portable Media Player) to be able to wirelessly access house NAS be that ethernet or bluetooth.
otherwise:  DO NOT BUY A FUZE
one star for excellent warranty / customer service otherwise I would have rated zero if it was possible

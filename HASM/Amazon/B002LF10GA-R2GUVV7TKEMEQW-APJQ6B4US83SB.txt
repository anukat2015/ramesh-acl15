Title: Very Neat Little Laptop
Content:
This is a very cool laptop which fits our needs for leisure travel extremely well. We are retirees who travel a lot and don't want to lug around a lot of weight but like to keep in touch with the rest of the world while we tavel. We thought long and hard about a Net Book but they are very limited in capability. For about the same amount of money the Acer is a fully capable Laptop with Windows 7 which works smoothly. We have Vista on our other 2 computers but Windows 7 appears to be an improvement although not a very dramatic one. We ordered the laptop through Amazon on Sunday and it arrived on Tuesday with no shipping charge. We took it out of the box, fired it up and it was running in a matter of minutes without a lot of messing around. We were able to get it hooked in to our wireless printer in minutes. Obvioulsy this laptop has a small screen so you will likely need your glasses to use it comfortably, but we are very pleased with this product.

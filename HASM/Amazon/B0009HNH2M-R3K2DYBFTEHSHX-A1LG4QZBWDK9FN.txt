Title: Not bad, about what you'd expect
Content:
I have been using an upright for my carpet and a canister w/ smooth floor attachment for my wood floors.  I got the Duros and here are the negative things I noticed:
1) On smooth floors it is more cumbersome to move the big beater bar head (with the beater bar turned off) around than a light smooth floor attachment.
2) On carpet, the canister has a shorter cord than the upright and you have to drag the canister behind you.
The positives are:
1) I've got one vaccum instead of two.
2) I don't have to change heads to go from smooth floor to a rug or from the carpet to a bathroom with a tile floor, just turn off the beater bar.
3) I can go all the way under the couches, chairs and beds because the handle goes all the way down to the floor.
4) I does a fine job, other than getting used to moving it around, and it was cheaper than each of the vaccums it was replacing that are a few years (10 years) older.
5) The hair cutter we have attaches to a vaccum to suck up the hair as it's being cut.  The hair cutter works on the new vaccum and feels like it pulls harder than the old one.

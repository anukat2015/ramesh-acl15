Title: Great Coffee!
Content:
Love my Bunn coffee maker. Not only does it make great coffee but it is super fast. Pour water in, turn around to get coffee mug out of cabinet and the coffe is finished. My husband and I just had our kitchen remodeled, were afraid the coffee maker would omit steam under new cabinets and ruin new surface. Guess what, Bunn coffee maker has no steam omitted because of hot water already there in the holding unit. I would recomend this product to everyone!!!!! 
Looks great on my new dark grey countertop.

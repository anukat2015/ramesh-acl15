Title: Absolute Garbage.
Content:
This product is a total waste of money.  The only reason I got it is because my HOA doesnt allow window units.
It claims 14000 BTU but can barely cool at 120 sq ft room.  On hot days it can only get my room down to 78 degrees.  It's pitiful.  Since that room never gets down to the thermostat temp, the compressor stays on constantly.
In addition to not working as an Air Conditioner, it also needs to be drained constantly.  It's supposed to exhaust the condensation, but it does an extremely poor job at that.  It will shut off after running for 6 hours or so.
GET A WINDOW UNIT IF YOU CAN

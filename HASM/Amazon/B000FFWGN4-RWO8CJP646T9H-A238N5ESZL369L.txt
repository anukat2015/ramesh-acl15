Title: Best vacuum we ever had
Content:
It is really Great purchase! We have a Golden Retriever dog and a fluffy cat. We had several expensive vacuums but all of them clogged of pets' hair.  This is a best affordable vacuum that really clean all pet's hair from the carpet. This one is designed that all dust goes directly to the bag's cup. I would highly recommend it to the people who have pets.

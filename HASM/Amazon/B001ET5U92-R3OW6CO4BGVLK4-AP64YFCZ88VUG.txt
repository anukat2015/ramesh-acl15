Title: Nikon D90 - Great upgrade from Nikon D40x!
Content:
I purchased the D90 as an upgrade to my Nikon D40x that I picked up in 2008.  I wasn't concerned so much with the new features as with the fact that there is a focusing motor inside the D90 so it will now work with all my lenses including the Tokina 11-16mm, and the Nikon 50mm f/1.4.  I've also found that the D90 is markedly better at shooting high-ISO, which is one area where the D40x faltered.  I can now take relatively noise free pictures in very dim light up to approx. ISO 1600 with very little noticable grain, unless you're zooming into the image all the way.
Great purchase...Nikon has done it again!

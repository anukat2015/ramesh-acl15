Title: MUST READ!  Faulty BIOS Upgrade
Content:
Fellow Amazoners:
I just bought this computer two days ago -- specifically the DV6-1030US.   The HP Update tool recommended that I upgrade the BIOS.  The error caused the computer to crash permanently.   This is happening now, and HP still has the faulty BIOS update on its website. 
I'd recommend buying another computer/brand until this problem is resolved.  The work around is kind of complex.  I would just hate to see you with what the techies call a "brick" -- a computer that won't power on, etc.

No joke.

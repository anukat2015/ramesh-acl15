Title: From Professional to Amateur Perfection
Content:
The best review I can give on this product is my personal experience with this camera.  I have used everything from high end professional use cameras, to the disposable digital cameras, to the credit card sized middle-class digital cameras.  I decided to jump to the middle ground for my last camera purchase, when I bought this one.  
I was in the same place a few months ago that many of you are in now; reading review after review on multiple websites.  Each review lists many details, many of which are very similar.  In all honesty, for most users, the minor details will not matter very much; it's more based on performance, which in this case, is top notch.  
I've had this camera for a few months now and I have absolutely zero complaints.  My range of subjects differs from senior portraits, going out with my friends, to sporting events, etc. and this camera captures all of them with an ease.  There are still elements on the camera that I am attempting to learn but the automatic capturing has been fully self explanatory.  
I believe this camera is perfect for people wanting to transition from a point and shoot digital to someone who is looking for a digital SLR.  With 10.1 mega pixels, the picture quality is high.  The 2.5" screen makes it easy to read and view pictures on a larger scale.  There are also some different Picture Styles.  This helps a lot when people aren't too computer savvy when attempting to create the perfect picture.  You can adjust certain settings on the LCD screen in order to get the right look for your picture.

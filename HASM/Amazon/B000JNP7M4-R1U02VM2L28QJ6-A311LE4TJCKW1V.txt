Title: Dissapointment - for under desk only
Content:
I bought this after reading the review saying it got a 12' x 12'  from 10C to 19c.  On high the only heat I feel is if I put me hand 6 inches from it.  I left it in the bathroom for hours and couldn't even tell it was on until put my hand near it.  May work well if you put it under a desk where you're working but not for bathrooms.

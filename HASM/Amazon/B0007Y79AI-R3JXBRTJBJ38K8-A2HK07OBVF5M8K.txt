Title: Do you research!
Content:
Yeah apple for coming out with a bigger flash drive! I give them complete kudos for teaming up with Samsung on this! Anyways...that said...I still think that it lacks some features that are available in other models that are not apple! I think that I would still tell customers that really want a sports model that the shuffle still is a better way to go! I work in the retail industry (MP3) and have seen several broken screens already...and a couple screen where half the screen goes out! That said if you are still wanting a NANO please with it also imediately get a protective case, and I would reccomended Apples additional insurance on it! They sell it for 2 years for 59.00! That being said invest in it...The battery is a internal lithium ion battery, and is roughly good for a year to a year and a half.... if it goes out on you APPLE charges about 100+ dollars to fix it! I have seen them go out as early as three months from my customers! Nothing would be worse then getting stuck six months into being the proud new parent of a IPOD with a huge service bill from APPLE to get the now exspensive hunk of junk running again...EVEN if you don't buy it from APPLE lots of retailers offer service plans on them SO DO YOUR RESEARCH! SO you don't become one of the many disenchanted ipod owners I have met....Do your research, and don't be a I-sheep!

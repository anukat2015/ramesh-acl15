Title: Great coffee maker if you like HOT coffee!
Content:
This coffeemaker looks great on the counter - and makes a great cup of coffee too. It makes very HOT coffee, which I like. This machine is a nice upgrade from my old GE. The only feature that would make this coffeemaker even better is an alarm that sounds when the coffee is done perking (the GE had that). I researched coffeemakers on Amazon and a bunch of other sites and this one is a solid buy for $40!

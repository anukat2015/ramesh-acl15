Title: Gorgeous little heater
Content:
I wanted a quiet heater for two things: To warm my face and hands while I sleep, and not run up my electricity bill. Other model dish heaters are too bright even on low 400 watt settings. Those are fine during the day time, but at night time it's like trying to sleep in the summer sun.
     This heater needs to be at least 3 feet, or maybe 4 feet away or else it gets uncomfortably warm until my cat finds it, then she parks in front of it and blocks all the heat.
     300 watts means it's the most economical heater on the planet, and now it's gone scarce on Amazon. I hope mine never breaks.

Title: Great Heating Unit, But Does Have Drawbacks
Content:
This small unit provides excellent heating power in a small, attractively designed package.  It does, however, have its drawbacks.  One is the annoying design for the control buttons.  One button on the unit controls both the heat temperature and the high/low fan (yes, only one button), which means you sometimes have to scroll through a number of temperature &amp; high/low settings before you get to the one you want.  The controls on the remote use exactly the same format.  Even more annoying are the popping sounds the heater can make when turned on, but in idle mode.  I'm guessing this is due to the ceramic heating unit being encased in a plastic shell.  As the ceramics heat and cool in idle mode, the unit emits brief, sharp, random popping noises as the plastic elements expand and contract.  Over time, I was able to block out these sounds, but think it is something that Bionaire could easily have identified and fixed during the testing phase for this product.  In the end, these annoyances may be minor if what you are looking for is a small, attractively designed unit that delivers great heating power.

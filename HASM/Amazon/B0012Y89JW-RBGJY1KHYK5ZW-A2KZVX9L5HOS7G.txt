Title: I love my XSi
Content:
The Canon ASi is the ultimate camera for anyone who is a novice photographer or beginner. The range and dynamics this SLR is capable of is outstanding and has the ability to work as a pro. This is the camera I dreamed of after years of the point and shoot digital cameras. The 3" LCD liveview screen is just one of the cool features this camera is equiped with. I priced the ASi at $799 at the local camera stores but purchsed online for $600.

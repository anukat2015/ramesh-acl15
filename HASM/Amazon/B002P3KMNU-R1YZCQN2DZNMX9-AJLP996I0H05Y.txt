Title: Good Product, Terrible Service
Content:
First, I love the computer.
- I can squeeze the 12 hours of battery life out of it, but I get 8-10 through normal usage.
- Performance is great in Windows 7 and with some older games.
- Solid construction. No flex aside from some minor battery wiggle that you get with any computer with this style battery.
- WiFi performance is great. If you're trying to steal your neighbor's WiFi you might have some issues, but for normal usage you'll be fine.
- Zero keyboard flex, which is impressive for any laptop. People complain about the UL80/50's keyboard flex, but from trying out other laptops, that seems to be the norm.
Now, the bad parts. My UL30A-A2 came with a scratched screen. Because the Asus representative told me that it would take 5 days to get a new computer, I decided to go through them instead of Amazon for the replacement. That is where all the troubles started.
- I sent the computer with a copy of the invoice. That invoice was apparently discarded before anyone looked at the computer.
- They received the computer at 10am on Thursday. Despite telling me there would be a 1-day turn-around in the depot, the computer was not even looked at until Monday. This was NOT over the holiday weekend, of course.
- They have now had my computer for two weeks, and I have not even been told when I will be seeing my replacement laptop back. No one will answer my questions, they simply keep telling me that they will "escalate the issue" and get back to me.
It's a good computer, but DO NOT use Asus customer service if you have any issues. Get it replaced through Amazon or just deal with the problem.

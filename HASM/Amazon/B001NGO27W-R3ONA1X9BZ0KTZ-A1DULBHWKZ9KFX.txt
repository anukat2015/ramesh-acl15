Title: So far so good!
Content:
I purchased this to replace my old Cusinart coffee maker that had slowed brewing almost to a stop.  So far it has worked perfectly and has some new improvements.  I like the fact that I can brew 14 cups when company comes.  The water measurment is easier with the outside view.  Cusinart has been a good product for me and always has good consumer reviews.

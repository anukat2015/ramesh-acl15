Title: Great Camera - Love the Anti-Shake
Content:
I have had this camera for about 6 weeks now and love it.  I have taken handheld Macro pictures with no shake!!!!  Great controls - I haven't even come close to figuring them all out, but even on the pre-programmed modes it's awesome.   I've learned more about photography and settings in the past 6 weeks than I ever did from a book.   
Gotta go take more pictures now

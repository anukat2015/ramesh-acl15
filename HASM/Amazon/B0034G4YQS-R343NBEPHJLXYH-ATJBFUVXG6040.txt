Title: Excellent laptop, dead trackpad.
Content:
This laptop is one of the best I've ever used. The processor is blazing fast, the hard drive space is more than adequate, and the LED screen is beautiful. Unfortunately, the trackpad completely stopped working within a week of purchase. Thank God for Amazon's hassle free return policy for dead on arrival laptops!

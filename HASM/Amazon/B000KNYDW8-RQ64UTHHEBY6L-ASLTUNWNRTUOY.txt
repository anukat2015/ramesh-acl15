Title: glorified fan
Content:
Unless the coolest you will ever want the room is 61 degrees, do not buy this product. Its internal thermostat has a low setting of only 61, and that is not the kind of "cold" many seek when buying a unit. Sure, 61 beats 95 on a hot July day, but I think we all want the option of making a room truly cool, like while we sleep. Most nights one is better off with a window fan rather that this piece of expensive crap.

Title: horrible install manual, no customer support
Content:
I bought this unit and the manual is basically non-understandable with practically microscopic drawings of installation.  Further, those instructions are both incorrect and misleading, both.  Called Cust. Serv and they never got back to me.  Fiddled with unit for a couple of hours and was able to install correctly. I have an engineering background and it still took some thought. 
Once you purchase unit and find you cannot install you are either left to try to figure it out yourself or return to store.
Also, unit ac does not turn on unless an exact menu sequence is pressed.  I guess this to be a hardwired logical procedure fault in the board. I think most people would discover this correct combo on their own.  I think most people would be able to install without return but terribly inconvenient.
Two stars only for quiet and cold.

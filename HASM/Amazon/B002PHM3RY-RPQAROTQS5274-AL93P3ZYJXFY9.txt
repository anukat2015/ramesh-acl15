Title: Works Great!
Content:
I received the Acer just before I left for a trip to Michigan.  The wifi works great and the computer is as advertised.  The battery lasted at least 8 hours and it is easy to navigate with Windows 7.  The only drawbacks so far is the lack of documentation; the screen is sometimes difficult to read because of the size, though bigger than a netbook; the sound volume is low without headphones.   I would recommend it for light computing and travel.

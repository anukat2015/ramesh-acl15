Title: Very Capable Digital SLR
Content:
This Canon is my first digital SLR. I had tried some others, but I really liked, and still like, the way this camera feels. The image quality is excellent, the kit lens that comes with the camera is certainly better than most people lead you to believe, and the speed is fantastic, in both start up and burst.
It's hard to say what the one best feature of this camera is because there really are more "best" features than one. Like I said, I really like the weight and feel of the camera. I believe it's still the lightest digital SLR on the market. Some have complained that it's too small. I disagree. For me, this camera fits me very well.
The start up speed is very good, if not excellent. Once I turn on the camera, it's ready to shoot long before I am. The battery life is phenomenal. While I haven't recorded exactly how many shots can be taken on a battery charge, I can say that it's hundreds. I personally have never run out of battery. Of course, I purchased a second battery for back up and simply cycle between them after each long shoot.
The speed that the camera writes to CF is astonishing as well, as is the ability to take several pictures in a row. This comes in handy when shooting moving objects, as it's hard to get that "one shot" that makes the day worthwhile. As I said before, the image quality is brilliant. I shoot in RAW+JPG mode, and doing so doesn't appreciably slow down the camera or the writing of the files to the CF card and the clarity and trueness of the image really is captured in RAW.
I cannot say enough about this camera. It is a steal at any advertised price.

Title: Good Player, Easy to use
Content:
I found that the Creative Lab's players are very easy to use. Before I purchased this 8GB model I had the 5GB model and it was a good unit as well. The color screen is nice, you can store photos and data on the device as well. The battery life is acceptable, and a nice feature of a user replaceable battery is better than most of the Ipods.

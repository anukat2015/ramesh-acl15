Title: I love my little Asus!
Content:
I wanted a laptop to just check emails, applications, and type documents. My Asus was the perfect choice. I don't miss windows either, the Linux system is pretty easy to figure out. I wanted something small that would fit in my purse and this works just fine. It also worked great with my digital camera.
 There are some things that could be better. The keyboard is rather small and took some getting use to. The screen could be bigger but after frequent use you get use to it. I'll probably upgrade to an 8.9". I prefer more memory, but at the price I purchased it for, I'm not complaining. I love the fact that it loads so fast. The internet connection is faster than my desktop. 
  If you need something to just browse the internet and type a document, Asus is your man!

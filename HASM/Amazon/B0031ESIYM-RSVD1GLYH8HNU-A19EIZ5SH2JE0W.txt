Title: Not at all bad for the price
Content:
Ok so its been a while since i had a new laptop but i think this one does what i need and it does it very well. the speeds are snappy, the longest waiting time i had was for windows to remove all the bundle software that came with the laptop (seriously, who uses McAfee still?).
Windows gave it an overall score of 4.0 and the reason for that is because the ATI Radeon in this laptop is designed more so for viewing video (HD at that) which displays great on its crisp LED screen. if you find yourself being a media hog i would recommend at least a network/external drive or upgrading the one with it, it comes with 320 (good for moderate users) but media people on a budget will find that they can fill that up in a moment. I have yet to test it with games but according to several reviews they say that the video card should be able to play games like modern warfare 2, on its lowest settings.
The Multi-touch track pad is something i have yet to find a true use for, sure you can start in the corner and spiral around like an ipod to scroll down or up.. but why? there is a built in scrolling bar. Ok so you can pinch in and push out to zoom in and out... most people already know that the scroll bar does the same thing... seems more like a gimmick then something useful even the photo rotating command feels awkward to perform.
all in all its a good laptop for the price, not for gaming or long flights (average battery time i get is about 2.5-3 hours), but it fits that niche for people who need to have a big screen for either media or for viewing a lot of documents.

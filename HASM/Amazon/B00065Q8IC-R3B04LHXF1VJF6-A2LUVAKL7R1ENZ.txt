Title: the 17-85 is definitely worth the extra $$$$
Content:
The 17-85mm is proving to be a very useful and very clean and crisp lens.  The IS really works.  The 135mm equivalent gets me through a lot of situations where if I were using the shorter kit lens I'd have to change to something longer.  I'm really pleased with it (and with my 20D - if only it had a spot meter)

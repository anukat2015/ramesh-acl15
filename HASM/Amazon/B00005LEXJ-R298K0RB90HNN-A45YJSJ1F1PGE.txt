Title: Great--Have owned 4, three still operating
Content:
I cannot see how anyone would not be blown away by these heaters. 
I had one that conked out after about 7 years (I thought that was outstanding product life). 
Bought 3 more over the past 1.5 years. All are doing great. 
I use the 3 I have now almost every day of our admitedly short winters in coastal NC. 
I use 1 in my Hot Tub enclosure every night of the week while sitting in my tub. 
1 in my carwash facility, 
and 1 in my Auto Repair shop. The only porblem is sometimes it gets too hot. Propane efficiency is pretty amazing. A 20lb tank lasts weeks!

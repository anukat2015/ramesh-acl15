Title: This thing ROCKS!
Content:
Ok, I know - it's just a vacuum, but if you're like me and have gone through 4 or 5 other vacuums and have always been disappointed - I guarantee you: the Miele will not let you down.  You can see online demonstrations of it's sealed canister system at YouTube, which for allergy sufferers or others concerned about vacuums that just recirculate the dirt, is of utmost importance.  But beyond that, this is just one beautiful little machine.  If you've shelled out hundreds for a Dyson only to be disappointed by it's flimsy plastic construction, you will be impressed by the Miele.  Every piece is solid - especially the wand which is so sturdy and well crafted it feels more like a precision built part for a fighter jet than a part for a vacuum.  The only downside to this sturdy construction is that it does make the wand a bit heavy, but I will take that over flimsy construction any day.  I have had vacuums so loud you couldn't hear the phone ring if it was right next to you - this one is so amazingly quiet you'll think that it can't possibly have good suction, but it does! Quiet, powerful, with a sealed container, true HEPA filtration and a cloth bag (not paper) which self seals when you remove it from the canister as well as unbelievable construction make this vacuum worth every penny!

Title: Very cute but major design flaws
Content:
We allowed this cute little machine drive us crazy for 15 days before we returned it.
1. The pot doesn't pour properly and it spills.
2. The water tank's lid doesn't open and close smoothly.
3. The power switch is impossible to operate with one hand. If you just push it (and the verb "push" is appropriate here), you'll be pushing the machine across the counter. First, you have to hold the machine with one hand so that it won't move when you are pushing the power switch with the other hand.
4. The lid of the pot doesn't sit in properly. It comes undone at the handle side.
5. The coffee gets cold quickly. (As noted by another reviewer, the stainless steel is not great for this function. It takes longer to warm the steel so the heat of the coffee is lost to the steel.)
My mistakes:
1. I thought auto-shut-off was a good idea. I thought 30 minutes would be enough to consume my morning coffee quota. As it turns out, I need more time. By the time I finish my second cup, the machine is already turned off and the coffee is cold.
2. Apparently there were good reasons why coffee pots were made out of glass. You can see through. You can see how much coffee is left. And there is no risk of making your fresh coffee on top of the leftover from yesterday. I thought I could live with a non-transparent coffee pot (just be organized, dump the leftover as soon as it becomes leftover, and rinse; don't forget to check before you make new coffee) but I am not that neat and tidy.
We hated this machine. What a shame! It looked so cute, especially in red.

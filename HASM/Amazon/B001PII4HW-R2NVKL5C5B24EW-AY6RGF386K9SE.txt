Title: Just becuase it has Vista
Content:
The quality is good, but were is the quality test control center? Its a 1.33 GHz which is very slow! It's slower that older computers. I don't even care if it saves electricity either way its going to waste your time. It has the same processor of laptops of 400. You must know how to install XP if you want a mediocre speed.

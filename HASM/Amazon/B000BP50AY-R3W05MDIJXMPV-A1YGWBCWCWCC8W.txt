Title: This player RULES
Content:
I took a chance with the m240 while it was on sale for $79 thinking "man, this is cheap, I bet it might suck," but I was pretty much blown away. This player sounds awesome! The built in equalizer really tweaks & boosts the sound, though I recommend better quality headphones than the included earbuds to experience its crisp, clean sound. The control buttons and menus are very easy and straightforward to use. FM works fine. I admit it's not the prettiest player around, but if you're like me and don't care about the cuteness factor (aka ipod), dazzling full color menus, photo/video capability, or ridiculous amounts of storage space, this player rules. 
Only criticisms (or maybe just me being too anal):
1) If you switch to FM mode in the middle of a song, it doesn't remember your time position within the song, or even what song you were previously listening to
2) The shuffle feature is kinda hidden within the menus; I wish there was a simple shuffle button
3) Playing full albums in the correct track order only works if the ID3 tag is formatted in a particular way (i.e. track "2" instead of "2 out of 10"), otherwise the tracks will be automatically played in alphabetical order

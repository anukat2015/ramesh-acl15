Title: Great idea but needs some work
Content:
I've had the Hot Shot machine for about 7 years now, and it still works great. I like that it is compact, that the heating coils aren't exposed, and that it shuts off automatically at boil. Obviously the longevity is excellent, but I have always had some issues with it. For one thing, mine leaks. (My original one did not but my previous roommate's boyfriend stole mine and replaced it with his leaky one, he had his about 6 months before I got mine.) I've always had to keep a cup under it or make sure I empty it.Secondly, it's too easy to trigger the heat button unintentionally, which can damage the coils if there's no water in it, and since it leaks you can't leave water in it. Also, it,s not that convenient to fill, filling a cup with water and pouring it in can be a bit messy unless the cup has a pour spout. It also only makes about 12z or so at a time.I'm certain the manufacturer would advise me to drain and unplug it when not in use, but that's not the point. We all like to do what's convenient for us. I recently got the Bodum Mini Ibis (also available here at amazon.com) and I'm much happier with its features and the way it works.

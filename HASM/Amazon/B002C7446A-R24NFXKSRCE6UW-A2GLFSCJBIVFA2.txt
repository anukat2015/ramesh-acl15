Title: MacBook Pro
Content:
This is my first Apple product, except for the Ipod.  It is very well made and looks great.  The display leaves nothing to be desired, and it has the first black keyboard that I have ever liked, because of the back light. Making the transition from PC has been almost fun, not a big problem.  I will still keep my PCs as much of what I do applies to the windows operating system. The MacBook Pro is great for moving around, though, or just sitting in a chair while watching TV. I like it, and it fills my need for a laptop very well. In short, it looks good, works good, and plays good.  What more could you ask.

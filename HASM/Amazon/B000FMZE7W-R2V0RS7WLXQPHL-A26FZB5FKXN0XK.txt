Title: ERROR CODES!!!
Content:
hello,
  let me start by saying this is not a diss on ZUNE or the person who sold it to me. Now that all the formal stuff is out the way let's get to the point.
1) i cant stand the error codes i keep getting when i try to load an album or song from my collection. bogus big time and then that crappy (!) that you click on and all it say's is get more credit or, file is a different format and needs to change.
all im asking for is a simple devise non Ipod and some ease when using it, i shouldn't have to struggle with error codes or reformatting my music to include connection errors, outside not being able to load the albums i want the most, i would say it's a good piece of gear!

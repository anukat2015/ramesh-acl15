Title: Nicely done by HP!
Content:
This is my first laptop as I head off to uni in a year, and my desktop was becoming unbearable. Initially, I was supposed to get a different model but settled on this one, hoping to get more RAM and lots of connectivity options. Got this at Best Buy for $250 cheaper, and is great for the price! The 4GB of RAM is extra handy for really demanding apps, the webcam works great, MediaSmart is great to watch videos and the sound is also great for music. The OS, Windows 7 greatly improves from its predecessor, no more annoying popups and the GUI is great!
I live in Australia, and the region has no issues with this laptop! Only a few issues remain: the annoyance of constantly appearing updates ("Computer Analysis"), the touchpad has its faults (be sure to buy a USB mouse), there's no Bluetooth connectivity and the computer can be unresponsive at times.
Other than that, the positives heavily outweigh the negatives so I would recommend this to anyone looking for a first laptop!

Title: Warm, but noisy
Content:
This space heater heats up my office in a jiffy.  However, the fan is a little on the loud side.  I don't mind that too much since my office neighbor often has employees chatting loudly in his office.  The fan drowns out their noise.  
I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is trying to heat a room in which you sleep or watch TV in. 
Also, there are two speeds on the fan and I didn't really notice a difference in output.

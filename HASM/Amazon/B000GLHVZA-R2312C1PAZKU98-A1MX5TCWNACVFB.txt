Title: Okay while it lasted
Content:
My husband and I bought this around February 2009.  We found that it did a great job at keeping a small room toasty.  In our living room, there was no difference in the temperature with it on, and the same goes for our kitchen.  In January 2010,  the heater's power button became stuck in the off position.  I sent out an initial email to [...] and then waited a week for a response. I sent out another one and still no response.  I just chatted on the live chat option and someone began talking to me right away.  I'm still covered under their one year warranty, so we'll see how/if they can fix it!

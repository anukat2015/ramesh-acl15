Title: Solid Value
Content:
I bought this unit at Best Buy on sale for around 35.00.  If you are only listening to music and have a computer to store the bulk of your mp3s 2 gigs is adequate for most purposes.  The addition of the FM tuner is iceing on the cake.  I love this tiny little unit.  The headphones leave a lot to be desired but can be inexpensivly replaced for best performance. Even with the replacement of the headphones, this unit compares favorably to much more expensive units (of which I bet you'll want to replace the headphones anyway).  Both of my daughters have much more expensive players and they keep commenting on how much they like mine.  Well, they can't have it!

Title: Finally a dripless carafe!
Content:
The B&D Smartbrew coffee maker has proven to be a reliable standard fare drip coffee maker with timer. It makes a good pot of coffee consistently and easily for a great price - and that comes from a daily coffee drinker. It also looks fine in a kitchen with stainless+black appliances although it has no stainless finish on it - just black.
The REALLY GREAT THING about this coffee maker is that I no longer dribble coffee all over my countertop trying to pour a cup, or water all over the place trying to fill the maker. Hats off to the engineers at B&D for solving a problem that has plagued drip coffee makers since the beginning! Very happy with this buy!

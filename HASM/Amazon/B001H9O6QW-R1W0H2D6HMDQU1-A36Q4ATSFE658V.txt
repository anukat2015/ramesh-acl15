Title: Absolute Garbage
Content:
The headphone jack does not work properly. Great features & great price....but it doesn't work. I exchanged the player at first thinking it was a fluke. The exchange was worse. The audio was scratchy at best. Seems that Sansdisk decided to cut corners on the simplest of things. I'm gonna spring for something better.

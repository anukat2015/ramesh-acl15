Title: Exceptionally Great
Content:
If you are like me:
1. Who is thinking of buying his next camera.
2. Have never used SLR before.
3. Wonder if it is really worth it to spend extra for Rebel, instead of a good point-n-shoot from Canon (for half the price?).
Well, Yes it is worth it, even the complete automatic mode is much better than best in the class point and shoot. And as you try other semi-automatic modes (like sports, night, portrait, closeup), you will realize it was all worth it.
I have recently promoted myself to using Av/Tv mode and took picture at very less light, without flash. They look so natural compared to generic point and shoot.

Title: Great Camera!
Content:
Years ago... I used to shoot a lot of 35mm slides, and my collection included several expensive Nikon lenses; when I initially switched to digital, the pro camera bodies were too expensive to consider.
The best thing about this camera was the low price point, and the ability to drive older auto-focus lenses.  I've since shot several hundred pictures; indoor, outdoor, and even had someone else use it to photograph my own wedding.  The 10.2MP is more than enough to replace my orginal 2.1MP camera, which I handed down to my kids.

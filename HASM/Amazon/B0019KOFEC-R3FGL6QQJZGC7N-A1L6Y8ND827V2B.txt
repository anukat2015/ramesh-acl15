Title: mighty good
Content:
This is actually the only style of vacuum I can own. Because of my pets and my long hair, a rotating style of vacuum is impossible. It just gets clogged with hair and has to be picked at with a knife or blade to undo the damage. This style, however, can just suck up everything. So, in that sense, it works amazing. I know I've used more powerful vacuums, but this one, for the money, does the job quite nicely. Also, I notice people care about the noise of the machine. I think this sounds about like any other vacuum. I guess some want it to be really quiet, but it's a vacuum, it's going to make noise. Get over it.

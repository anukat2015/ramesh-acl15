Title: Great Camera for Beginners
Content:
This camera is an excellent choice for photographers just starting out. I would definitely go for this camera rather than upgrading to the 30D or higher. It's not all that expensive, and it has most of the features of its more expensive cousins. The only negatives are that it seems too lightweight,  especially when using larger lenses. Also, even for a beginner, I would not buy the kit lens. I made that mistake, and I wish I had just bought the inexpensive 50mm 1.8 II lens. It's [...] and well worth it. Later, you can buy a separate zoom lens. However, altogether, this is a great camera for beginners.

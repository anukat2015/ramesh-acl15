Title: Coffee Maker Excercise in Form over function
Content:
First of all; yes, it's pretty.  I'll admit I bought it because of the name and the appearance.  That said, I have to add the following:
1.  I agree whole heartedly that the thing pours like crap.  I don't understand people who claim otherwise.  I just poured a travel mug full and it almost took almost a full minute.  (No, it's not a ten-gallon cup.)
2.  I've tried different combinations of grinding fineness and water/coffee ratios but I've never had a good cup of coffee from this thing.  I even do the "let the water sit out overnight" routine.
3.  Emptying & cleaning the gold filter is a pain and waste of water.  Give me a good paper filter that can be tossed in the garbage in a flash.
4.  I am probably around 70 uses so now I have to hunt the earth for a water filter?  Thanks for the heads up on that one, fellow reviewers.
5.  I've ended up with a counter full of coffee a couple times too.  You have to make sure it's set in JUST SO.
Run, don't walk from this thing.

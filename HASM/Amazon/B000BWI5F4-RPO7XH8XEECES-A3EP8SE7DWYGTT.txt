Title: Really quiet and efficient
Content:
This is a really nice, lightweight portable vacuum.  It does a wonderful job on my hardwood floors.  It picks up all the dust, pollen, and cat hair..plus kitchen crumbs, etc.  The hard floor brush stays on pretty well, but does get snagged on furniture legs if vacuuming under beds, etc., so be prepared to "retrieve" it periodically.  The vacuum did not come with a round dusting brush, which would have made the vacuum more versatile.  I use the one from my old vacuum, which works fine.  I tried to go to their website to see if I could order one, but the website is pretty much useless.  Overall, it is a good machine.  It is so lightweight and quiet, I can get it out and vacuum up a mess while my husband watches TV.  He doesn't even have to adjust the volume up.  Its great for stairs since its so light.

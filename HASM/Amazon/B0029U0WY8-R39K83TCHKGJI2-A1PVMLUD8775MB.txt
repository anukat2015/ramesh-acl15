Title: Eh.
Content:
So I got this camera a couple months ago, and I have to say, I am never buying a Sony DSLR again. It seems like the lowest of the low entry level SLR's. I would much more recommend the Canon Rebel XSi, or the Nikon D60 as your entry level. The battery life sucks, and the image stabilization doesn't do much at all. Low light shots turn out GRAINY, and I am just overall not impressed.

Title: Awful....
Content:
This is the most horrible vac I have ever owned. I used this less than 10 times with 1 dog and 1 cat and it lost its suction, the filters had to be cleaned constantly,  and the dirt conatiner is sooooo small. It is also terribly dusty when you try to clean out any of the other filters. While cleaning today it basically backfired and left my in a cloud of dust.....Fortunately I was able to take it back to the store. Don't buy this- its awful!!!

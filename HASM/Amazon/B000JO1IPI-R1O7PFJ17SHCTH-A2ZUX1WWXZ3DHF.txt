Title: Very Cool
Content:
I upgraded from a the 5th generation 8gb nano to the iPod Classic 80gb this week, and though I have only used this iPod several times, I have to say that it is the coolest.  
I was  anti iPod for a very a long time. They didn't make sense to me; plus I loved going to music stores, combing through the stacks to find something new to take home and listen to. Well, these days it is more difficult to get to the music store, and the RADIO stinks. I went through a few years of really not caring about music. Then I discovered iTunes which is one of the best inventions ever in my opinion. I have discovered so many great musicians and albums through iTunes and have built a fairly large library of music over the past year.
My nano still works great and I will continue to use that in the gym, but my Classic holds all my songs; it sounds better than my nano; it responds better than my nano. Plus, I don't know if this is also a feature of the 5g iPod Video, but I like knowing how many songs are in each of my playlists; I like scrowling the coverflow, stopping on a paticular album, knowing what songs I have from that album.
The Classic really is very cool to play, and it is attractive. I think it is a must have for any music lover out there.

Title: Well Pleased
Content:
Recently I purchased the Hoover S3865 Platinum Cyclonic Bagless Canister with all accessories and so far I am very well pleased with this unit.  I was surprised at the amount of dirt dust and dander this machine picks up, has great suction and does not lose it.  I have a dog and cat who constantly seem to shed even with good grooming really picks up the pet hair.  I am impressed with the way it handles,however the suction hose is a bit stiff, but I do like all the attachments and the way it cleans.  The power nozzle does a great job on the carpets and is very easy to maneuver about the bedrooms.  Love the swivel action it has as well as the bare floor brush.  If I need another vacuum in the future I will definitely revisit the Hoover family.

Title: shuts off too often, hard to restart
Content:
although i am very happy with my little Holmes heater, thought i would try something different for my second heater.  seemed like a good idea at the time, from the description.  unfortunately, when it shuts off at the "right" temperature, it doesn't restart easily.  it also does not get very warm.  returned the product, and bought my second Holmes heater.

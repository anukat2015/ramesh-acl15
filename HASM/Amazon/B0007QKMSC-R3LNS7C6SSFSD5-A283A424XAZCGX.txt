Title: Lovin' it!
Content:
I actually picked out this camera from perk points I had through work. i enjoy photography as a hobby using a Nikon N65 SLR film.  I wanted to take my shots up a notch & really experiment so I decided to dive into the work it digital.  This camera is phenomenal.  The depth of colors is definitely different w/o even adjusting or using special filters.  It's easy to use & adjust your shutter speed & aperture, even if you just use the presets for macro, night, portrait, etc. you get fantastic shots. Would definitely buy over again.

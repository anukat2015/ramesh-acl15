Title: It's OK
Content:
I bought this heater thinking it had a temperature switch, it doesn't, that is the disappointing part I am currently working in Afghanistan, in the mountains i live in a tiny room about 6x6 it gets to hot then i have to shut it off, then it gets cold in the room so i have to turn it on again, it really stinks when its 2 or 3am and have to click it on or off, if the room was bigger i think this heater would be ideal. I am still happy i have it!

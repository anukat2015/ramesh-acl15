Title: Sweet Camera... Great price
Content:
There is no better camera with this kind of balance between: good price, easy to use and reliable, for the common user. Sure it's not a Hasselblad, but not everyone can afford to drop $40,000 on a camera. Auto focus works well. From turning it on, to focusing and taking a picture in good light it takes about 2 seconds. It's not like a regular non-SLR digital camera where you only get the dolphin's splash after he jumped or your kid after he's already run to first base. You can stop the action perfectly and at a reasonable price. I would recommend this to any standard consumer without hesitation.

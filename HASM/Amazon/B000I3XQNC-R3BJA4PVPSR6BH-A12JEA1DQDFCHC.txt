Title: Excellent camera, perfect step up
Content:
The Digital Rebel is a great, great camera for anyone ready to make the step up from point-and-shoots. It has all the advanced settings you'd ever want, but if you're a novice like me the automatic mode takes better pictures than you probably ever imagined you could produce. It really is that much better than any other digital you've probably ever tried, including the speed.
If you are looking at this camera you are probably also considering the Nikon. I know several people who own Nikons (D50s and 40s), and to me they are a little more complicated to operate, as if they are designed more for the expert crowd.
If you buy the Digital Rebel I would suggest getting the battery grip accessory. It adds a very convenient and comfortable means of holding the camera and it allows you to go literally weeks without charging.

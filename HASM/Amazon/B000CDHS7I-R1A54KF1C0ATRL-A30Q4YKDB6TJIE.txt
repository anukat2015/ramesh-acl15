Title: Good but not perfect
Content:
I bought this coffee maker to replace a Zojirushi Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker, not because it didn't make good coffee, but because it was inconvenient to use. This new Krups solved all those problems, but adds two new ones. The coffee doesn't stay hot nearly as long as the Zojirushi, and you must turn the carafe upside down to get out the last cup of coffee. I haven't noticed the complaints listed by others about a plastic taste or poor tasting coffee. Mine tastes just fine.

Title: Brews excellent coffee and keeps it hot for hours.
Content:
We selected this coffee maker for two reasons:
1) Consumer Reports said that, when brewing, their tests showed it heated water to the appropriate brewing temperature.
2) It has a carafe instead of a heating plate.
And I have not been disappointed. The machine brews an excellent pot of coffee every morning. And then keeps it hot for hours. This is perfect for a household like mine where one of us frequently gets up early and the other might not need to get out of bed for a few hours. The coffee stays hot for at least four hours and is never burned because there is no hot plate on this machine.
I only have two cons:
1) Because of the metal items on this device, I expected it to be less plasticy and feel more sturdy than other coffee makers I have bought. That's not really the case. It feels flimsy like most coffee makers. But in the end, that apparently doesn't matter.
2) We had a week where the pot kept over-flowing and spilling out on to the kitchen counter while brewing. Turns out this happens if you twist the carafe lid too tight. Now we know and haven't had that problem since.
Also, I ended up buying this Permanent Gold Cone Coffee Filter and it fits perfectly in to the basket, saving the waste of hundreds of paper cones.

Title: Good value for a canister vac
Content:
Seems to do the job! I have both hardwood and carpet and wanted a vac that would transition easily from one to the other. This vac is very light and easy to use. On the downside, it arrived with the handle to the dust cup broken, when I called Hoover they wanted to charge for a replacement, so I'm taping it up instead! Apart from that it seems to be a good vaccum.

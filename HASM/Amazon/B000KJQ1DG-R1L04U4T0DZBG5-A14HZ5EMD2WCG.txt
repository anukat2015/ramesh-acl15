Title: DSLR for the rest of us!
Content:
If you turn into a shutterbug put it on eBay and get a d300. d3, Canon???, etc. Otherwise, this is all you will ever need for wonderful photographs. Bought one for myself and one for my real estate broker daughter. I love it and she is very happy now that her property pictures are so much better.
The nicest part is the way this camera handles and feels. Most important. I would say check it out against the competition in your local camera store, but doing that and then buying it on online is kind of dubious. If you do that, give the camera store a chance to meet the price.
I find Amazon's reviews, taken with an occasional grain of salt, a great way to evaluate everything from cameras, such as this, to kitchen tools. Anyway, you won't go wrong with this camera unless you really need more pixels, in-camera autofocus, or some such and don't mind spending the money for same.
Best of luck

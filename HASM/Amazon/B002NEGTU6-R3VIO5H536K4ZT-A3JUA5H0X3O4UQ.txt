Title: What an Amazing Product!!!
Content:
This camera is a little difficult to learn at first, but you grow on it and that's what makes it an amazing product. The features all work correctly, and I have had no problems with the camera at all. I do not recommend this for amateurs as you'll waste more time figuring out the functions then shooting. All in all, I love it :)

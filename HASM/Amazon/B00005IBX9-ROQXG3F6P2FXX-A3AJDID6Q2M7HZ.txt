Title: More pros than cons
Content:
Have had this coffee maker for about a year now. Overall, it works great. It's fast and the water filter definately helps. You can adjust the burner temperature to your liking. And the 1 - 4 cup setting is great for making a small batch of coffee.
On the negative side, I agree with other reviewers that it's hard to get the last drops of water out of the carafe. Also, there's no external water level indicator. The water level indicator is inside of the reservoir and I have to shine a light to see it. So if I use a different pitcher to fill the reservoir, it's a real pain. Another small iritation I found is that the same knob controls setting the auto brew time and turning on the auto brew. So if you turn on the auto brew, then later want to double check what time it's set for or change the time, turning the knob to the time setting will turn off the auto brew. You have to remember to turn the auto brew back on after you turn the knob back to auto brew.
Keep in mind that it uses European style coffee filters. I had a bunch of American style coffee filters, so I had to fold them up to use up the rest of my stock (had a costco sized bag of them).

Title: best value for money from Nikon
Content:
this camera is the best value for money from Nikon. and probably is gonna be my only DX format from Nikon. it offers all what you expect from a DX Nikon except the on board focus thats available in D90 but I still prefer this one. simply because i never use auto focus and the body is alot smaller than D90. D5000 is the most compact DSLR ever and the screen tilts and rotates which makes it much more handy to me.
because the body doesnt have a built in auto focus you should use a lens that has the feature therefore lenses are a little more expensive than those for the d90 but in general I am never gonna buy any other DX format because this one is all i need.
picture quality with the image sensor available in this camera is world class and can make pictures good enough to be on a cover of a photography magazine; its that good

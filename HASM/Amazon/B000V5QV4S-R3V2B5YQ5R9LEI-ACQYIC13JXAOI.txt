Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)
We replaced our Canon 10D with the 40D which was stated to advance the state-of-the-art for mid-range digital SLR cameras.  It does that in spades with a newly enhanced 10.1 megapixel inaging sensor offering a fast 6.5 frame per second autofocus continuous shooting capability.
We primarily use this camera for wildlife photography, utilizing some action shots, and the speed sensitivity for this is fantastic.
A larger 3.0 inch LCD screen increases viewing ease, especially important in wildlife photography.  Raised brightness levels allow for viewing ease under bright sunlight conditions.  Also the larger font size for viewer window text is helpful.  The upgraded viewfinder expands the viewing angle to 264 degrees and raises the eye point to 22mm.
The 40D comes with a durable case (black or magnesium alloy) and weather-resistant construction.  With a 14 bit Analog-to-Digital conversion process, the 40D is able to recognize 16,384 colors per channel, resulting in more accurate gradations of tone and color.  It also offers two interchangeable focusing screens, unlike its predecessors and its autofocus offers enhanced precision at f2.8 or faster.
Comes with an eyecup, wide neck strap, video cable, USB interface cable, battery pack, battery charger, EOS Digital Solution disc, software and a couple of photography and macro booklets.
Add the wide-angle lens of your choice and you're set to go.

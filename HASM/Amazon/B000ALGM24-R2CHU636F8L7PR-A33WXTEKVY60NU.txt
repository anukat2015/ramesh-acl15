Title: Easy Energy Savings
Content:
Very pleased with the simplicity and effectiveness of this thermostat.  Love the backlighting for nighttime adjustments.  Very easy to program and install.  I think this will save me quite a bit on my energy bills.  Easy to set on hold for vacations, and a single button lets you tell it you are home during a day you are to be out and keep it at the highest setting.  I highly recommend this thermostat.

Title: Finally!!!
Content:
This company finally got it right!  An efficiant, compact, unobtrusive heater that fits into any room.  Having an older charecter home presents some problems when the winter chill comes around!  My upstair usually doesn't stay as warm as my first floor and that is an issue when I crawl into bed.  Now, I head off to bed, plug in my Lasko, and in 15 mins my room is 70+ degrees and I can drift off to sleep warm and peaceful.  My furnace gets a break as does my pocketbook.  It has been the best purchase I've made in a long time!

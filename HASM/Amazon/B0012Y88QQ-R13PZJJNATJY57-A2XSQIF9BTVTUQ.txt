Title: Best Deal for the Money
Content:
I researched the dickens out of this range of D-SLR before finally deciding to buy the Canon Digital Rebel XSi.  I couldn't be happier with this camera.  Image quality is outstanding, features are very user-friendly, and controls are intuitively arranged on the body.  I even like the software included with the camera.  I would definitely upgrade the lens to afford greater reach, and the EF 28-135mm IS USM lens is now my primary lens.  The images I've been able to capture with this camera are stunning, and I'd say much better than I anticipated.  Although I was very cautious about upgrading to a digital SLR camera, knowing what I know now, I would buy this camera again in a heartbeat.

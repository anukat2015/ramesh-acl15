Title: Spectacular! Very pleased!
Content:
The package on this product says it will heat 200 square feet. I live in a 900 square feet apartment and along with a tiny little $12 space heater, my apartment is nice and toasty!  I do have my sliding patio door open about a fingers width for ventilation and it's even heating that large room despite the heat loss. 
I'm thankful I bought this a few months ago as part of my emergency preparedness. Each year I have my gas shut off (on purpose) to save $ when spring gets here. Well, apparantly spring wasn't quite here yet. We've got several inches of ice and snow and more on the way.  I'm glad to have this product. We'll stay warm and toasty.  (I won't take the risk of running it overnight, though, even though I do have carbon monoxide detectors in two rooms.)

Title: Only lasted a year.
Content:
Ours lasted longer than many other reviewers - about a year of daily use. Now, the coffee is only warm. The larger the batch, the cooler the coffee. Even a six cup batch is too cool to enjoy. Brewing a full pot is a waste of time and coffee. We hope the Farberware 12 cup that we just ordered holds up better.

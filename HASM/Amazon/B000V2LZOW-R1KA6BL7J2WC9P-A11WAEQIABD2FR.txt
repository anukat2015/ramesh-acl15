Title: Somewhat torn....
Content:
I bought this USED as a gift for a friend. The service was absolutely outstanding and I appreciate all that the seller did for me to get it shipped quickly and even included a birthday greeting. HOWEVER, according to the recipient, the product does not work at all. He says the battery was dead and won't charge, there was no video or sound card and it does not hook up to the internet.... I don't really know what to think. He lives in Florida. I live in Utah so I can't look at it myself. I still give a thumbs up to the seller though. And maybe my friend is just an idiot who doesn't know how to run a laptop.... LOL

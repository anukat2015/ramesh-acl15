Title: Works Best Brewing 10 Cups - Not Piping Hot
Content:
My husband and I enjoy this coffee maker. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it keeps coffee hotter if you make the full 10-cups at a time. I use refrigerated creamer, so my mug of coffee will not be piping hot, but it's hot enough for me. Taking the carafe off the plate after the brew is finished keeps it warmer longer. For those that like piping hot coffee, the Mr. Coffee model we had before with the heated plate will keep it really hot, but may also burn the coffee. The carafe does pour slowly, but I have never had a problem. It is a little difficult to clean out. I usually use a bottle brush. When adding water, I use a lightweight plastic cup we keep in the dish rack for that purpose. It pours faster, does not have any coffee residue to gum things up, etc.

Title: 18+ months of solid, quiet service
Content:
Looking for a lighter weight alternative to an upright bagless model when we moved to a 3 story place, I bought the Oxy3.  It has been fantastic - great on carpeting and hard floors, quiet and efficient, easy to maneuver.  It's had to go in for service twice (both due to someone not detaching something correctly and shearing off one of the connector pins - slide the latch, that's what it's for!), but both times the repair was inexpensive and quick.  The suction is great on this model.
I'm also much happier with a vacuum that uses bags - getting all the stuff out of the canister of the bagless model was always a mess, and unless I washed the canister out there was always so much dust left in there (not to mention how static-y the thing was).  The bags are simple to change and contain the mess.

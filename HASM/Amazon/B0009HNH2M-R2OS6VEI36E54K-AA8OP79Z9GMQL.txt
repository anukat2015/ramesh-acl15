Title: Avoid.. or get two!
Content:
OK, I get the point that I should take better care of my things. Still... this vacuum is far from being the sturdiest one. It's quite inexpensive though, so while shopping around for a replacement, I bought the same! 
If I could change the rating to 3 stars , I would now.  The advantage of having one more of the same is that now I can put together all four pieces of the wand and have an extra extra long one that reaches the most difficult corners of the ceiling. Yes, I  like to push things :)
My original review:
It does an adequate job for normal house cleaning, but heavy duty jobs, such as dry wall dust are too much for this vacuum. However I don't have a comparison term since I never tried this with other vacuums. The power adjustment broke after 1 year and it's not worth repairing. Luckily it's stuck at the highest setting. It is very loud. Filters are hard to find but I found that the Shark EP754/EP754C, which are widely available, are a perfect fit and they are also HEPA.

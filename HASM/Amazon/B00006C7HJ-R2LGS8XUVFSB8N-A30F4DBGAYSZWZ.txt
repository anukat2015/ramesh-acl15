Title: Extreme Fire Hazard!
Content:
This was a major rip-off. And also a safety hazard! After only 4-5 months of use, the heating element burned through the wiring on the fan and it shorted out. Sparks shot out of the socket, even when it wasn't on when I plugged it in. The plug isn't even grounded. Spend your money elsewhere and stay safe!

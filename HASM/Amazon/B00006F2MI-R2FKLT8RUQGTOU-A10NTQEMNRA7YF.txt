Title: Great coffee; Difficult coffeemaker!
Content:
We got this coffeemaker seven months ago and purchased it for around $100.  I read the Amazon reviews and was not swayed by the complaints of a loud grinder--I have to get up in the morning anyway, so why not a loud grinder.  And it IS LOUD--kind of like having a small engine plane in your kitchen.  It is a cantankerous machine:  skip one step in the assembly and you have a coffee fiasco.  Forget the cover to the basket: weak coffee.  Line up the lid of the carafe incorrectly: Big mess.  Don't push in the basket correctly: No coffee.  Lid is so tight I swear you'll develop upper body strength to get it off. So it's a hassle if you are tired the night before and skip a step, but the machine makes GREAT coffee.  Unfortunately as I write this my Cuisinart coffee maker has THREE times spewed a hot water/coffee ground mix (the entire contents of the reservoir) onto my countertop.  The machine was put together correctly, so my husband and are are baffled as to why we can't get the coffee to end up in the carafe.  While this machine makes excellent coffee, it is just not worth the hassle.  My last machine (a Mr. Coffee) lasted about three years.  I was not intending to make a half year purchase.  This coffee maker is just not worth the headache.

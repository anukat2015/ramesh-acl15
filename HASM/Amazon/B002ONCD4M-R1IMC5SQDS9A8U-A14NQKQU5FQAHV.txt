Title: Great Laptop
Content:
I researched laptops for 8 weeks before choosing this HP Pavilion. It is fast and well built. The screen is bright and Windows 7 is a vast improvement over Vista. The battery life is good. I use it on my lap all the time. It would have been nice if the battery were centered but it's not a big deal. I am only having an issue with the media card reader. It appears to need an adapter for Pro cards that I don't have. Yes, it is a fingerprint magnet but so what. This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to everyone!

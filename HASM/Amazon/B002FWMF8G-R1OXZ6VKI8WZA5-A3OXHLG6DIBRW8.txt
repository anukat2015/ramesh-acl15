Title: WOW! What A Hit! Highly Recommended!
Content:
This has quickly become my favorite kitchen toy ever! The Mr. Coffee Frappe Maker has been in almost constant use since we opened the box and everyone in the house is somewhat wired since we forgot to get decaff coffee. 
This is amazingly simple to use and the directions are surprisingly intuitive. It is possible to be drinking a delicious frozen beverage within 10 minutes of opening the box, with the actual brew and blend time being less than 5 minutes. Here are my observations:
Pros -
+ Very easy to use, from start to finish - with an automatic blend after the brew is over (scared the heck out of us when it did it the first time!)
+ Easy to clean
+ Very fast brew and blend cycle
+ Can make tea Frappes too (a hit with my daughter!) - See the included recipe book
+ Makes two full sized servings
+ Relatively small counter top footprint (very important to us)
+ Can be used as regular blender
Cons - 
- Possible to overfill the blender section with drink ingredients, liquid can escape out of the drip hole when the blender starts - you will learn quickly what will be a problem (under half a cup with a ice load should be fine)
Recommendations -
* Dark Roast Coffee taste best (we used Folgers Dark Roast Supreme and use rounded scoops)
* Try using the baking extracts for flavoring! They make great tasting drinks!
* For diabetics (like me) and those looking for low carbs, try Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor for Coffee, Mocha, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)
This is a fun and convenient appliance that will continue to be used long after the novelty wears off!
Highly Recommended!

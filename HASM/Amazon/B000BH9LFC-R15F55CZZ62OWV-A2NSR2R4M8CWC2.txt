Title: Stopped working and I am thankful
Content:
This coffee maker is disliked by many because of a few problems with the lid, the way the water goes through the coffee, and the basket, all which tend to make the coffee weaker than it ought to be.  That wastes a lot of coffee!  So when mine quit yesterday, after only a few months of poor operation, I was not too displeased, for today I shall head to K Mart and pick up a new one, of a different brand.

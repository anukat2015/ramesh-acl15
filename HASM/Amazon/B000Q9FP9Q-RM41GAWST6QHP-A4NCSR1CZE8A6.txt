Title: leaks like a seeve
Content:
bought this product from a vietnamese supermarket for the same price as offered here.   used the evaporative function for about a week, then it started leaking.   Took it apart found no cracks in the water tray, also tightened up the drain plug with teflon tape, still leaked.  put a ring of plumbers putty where drain hole in water tray meets the frame and reseated the water tray.  Did not leak for about an hour, so I left for work, came back home after a few hours, the towels I placed around the bottom on the unit was soaked, leaked again.   Cannot return it as I've thrown the box and reciept away.   The fan function is powerful and works good not sure about how good the ionizer works, but it is always on.  Once the unit dries off, I will just use the fan function.  Unit is also very light and is attractive, too bad it leaks, will not get another one.

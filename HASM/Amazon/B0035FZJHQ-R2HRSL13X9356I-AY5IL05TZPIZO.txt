Title: Awesome DLSR, top-notch video mode, excellent value
Content:
Wow, what a camera.  This is my third Digital Rebel SLR and fourth Canon DSLR (the other being the 30D), and it does not disappoint.  In fact, it is an awesome camera in just about all respects in its price range.  The sensor delivers excellent results (although this will depend largely also on the lens used), the high ISO images are stunningly good for what they are, and the LCD screen is a joy to look at.  Coming from a 3" screen with 200K pixels, it's a delight to look at the same size LCD with over a million pixels.  
Of course the big feature is the full-featured video mode on the T2i.  At 1/3 of the 5D Mk.2's price, it includes 720p mode that 5D Mk.2 does not, and at 1/2 price of the 7D, it has identical video mode PLUS the 640x480 crop video mode which the 7D does not, in essence providing a zoom of about 7x magnification at any given focal range.  The crop video mode works like this:  Rather than taking the whole output of the sensor and outputting that as either 1920x1080 (1080p) or 1280x720 (720p), it takes the actual 640x480 real estate at the middle of the sensor and outputs that as the capture.  So much like how the cropped sensor provides 1.6x magnification for the Canon DSLRs, the cropped video mode provides magnification for video shoots.
By the way, I've been using a super-cheap $3 eBay microphone that I originally got for Skype on my laptop, and it provides loads better pickup than the built-in microphone.  It's got a flexible neck, about 5" long, and using it also reduces the lens zoom noise, handling noise, etc.
I was a bit afraid, before the purchase, how the manual focusing during video shooting would work.  While there are auto-focus methods during the shooting, they are slow and will throw the clip out of focus for 2-4 seconds.  I'm happy to say that for this absolute video-on-DSLR novice, the T2i with the 18-55 IS kit lens turned out to be fairly easy to use and achieve good results.  The IS helps a lot to reduce the invariable hand shake, unless you've got the camera mounted on a tripod.
I've got one observation and two gripes, both pretty minor.  The observation is the computer resources required to handle the full 1080p video.  Each minute of the 1080p and 720p video is approx. 330MB in size.  720p produces the same size because it records at twice the framerate of the 1080p mode (60fps vs. 30fps).  Viewing the native 1080p clip straight from the camera will need fairly significant CPU power.  On my Core 2 Duo laptop with 4GB of memory, it's NOT smooth.  I'd imagine any Core i5 or Core i7 processor would be fine.  So I use a freeware called Handbrake to encode the video to h.264 mp4 format, which results in about 1/3 of the size of the original file with virtually no loss in quality.  This output plays flawlessly on my laptop.
The first gripe is the dial mode.  The two modes that I will use the most, "P" and "Movie", are at opposite ends of the dial.  It takes me two or three finger actions to turn the mode back and forth.  While it's doable, it certainly would have been much more convenient if the modes were closer to each other, or if there was a separate movie mode activation button on the camera (like the 7D).  
The second concern is the rubber door sealing the microphone/remote/AV/HDMI ports. I like to use an external microphone for videos, so I open and close the door fairly frequently.  The rubber hinge piece seems rather fragile--only time will tell how long it will last.  
All in all--HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It's a fantastic camera jam packed with great features.  I'm looking forward to using it!

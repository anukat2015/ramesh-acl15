Title: Very Pleased with the E420
Content:
Just received my E420 from Amazon a week ago and love it. Thank you Amazon for wonderful service and a great price on top of that. After being a 35mm enthusiest from years back, I wanted to get back into photography but of course on the digital side. The E420 is my first DSLR and am amazed at the versatility and quality of the photos I taken with it. For the price, I don't think you can get a better entry-level DSLR. I noticed that it's one of the seven cameras that Popular Photography has nominated for Camera of the Year 2008. With all the cameras on the market now, that says a lot.

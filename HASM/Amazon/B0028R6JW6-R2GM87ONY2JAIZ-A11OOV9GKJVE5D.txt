Title: Nice computer - bad service
Content:
Pros:
Inexpensive- Got mine for $400. It was the least expensive laptop I found with a screen larger than 12"
Reasonable Specs
Looks great - I get a lot of compliments when I go out with it.
Light weight
USB Ports Plenty are readily available - unlike the Macbook Air.
Cons:
The keyboard feels cheap
Windows Vista, but if you buy between July and December (I think) you get a free Windows 7 Upgrade. I'm waiting on mine.
I got this to replace a 5+ year old Powerbook G4. I'm a little disappointed that Vista has crashed twice in the week I've had it, but I'm anxiously awaiting my Windows 7 upgrade. I would have preferred a Mac, but they're too expensive. 
**Update** I returned the computer to the online vendor because the hard-drive crashed. I don't have negative feelings towards the fact that after three weeks of use the hard-drive crashed because that's just what happens sometimes. I'm livid about the customer service that MSI offers. I spent probably over an hour and half on hold (between two different phone calls) without ever speaking to a tech rep. I never heard from them about the Windows 7 upgrade. After the headache I just wanted to get rid of the computer. If I never buy an MSI computer again it will be because of their horrific customer service, not because of the quality of the product.

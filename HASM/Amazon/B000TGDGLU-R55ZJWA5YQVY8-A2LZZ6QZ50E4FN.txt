Title: very good heater
Content:
I purchased this heater to try to offset my gas bill this coming winter. When it was delivered I plugged it in, and let it warm up, and it heats as I thought it would. It does take about an hour for it to heat up and make the room comfortable. The thing I love about this heater is NO NOISE!!!, and I can use it in my garage also with no worry about open flames while working on my car or working around gas. Would I purchase it again? YESSSSS

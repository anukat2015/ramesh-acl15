Title: Big Buddy disappointment.
Content:
After having bought and used the Little Buddy heater, I purchased the Big Buddy to get the higher heat output for my shed and back porch. The unit is well made and very sound. There are two major problems that I have found: 1)when the heater is on the highest setting, the propane cylinders get so cold from the high flow of gas that the heater shuts down. This is only a problem if the temperature that you are using it in is below 40 degrees F. If you are using it as an auxillary heater in the house, it does not frost up. 2) hooking the heater to a larger tank is not even discussed in the instruction manual, other than stating that an inline fuel filter should be used. It doesn't state if the line should be hooked to one side of the heater or the other, or if you need 2 hoses. 
 The frosting up issue is the biggest disappointment for me. I can't use it in my shed in the winter because of this. Make sure you know how you are going to use this unit before you purchase it.

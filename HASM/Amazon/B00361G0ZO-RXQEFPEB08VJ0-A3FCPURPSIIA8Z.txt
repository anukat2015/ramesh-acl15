Title: Great laptop, when it works
Content:
I bought this laptop for school, and a little gaming now and then. The processor worked just as expected, it was fast and reliable. But, after using the laptop for schoolwork for two weeks, I decided to play Bad Company 2. The graphics were sub par and the fps was between 6 and 15. I ran a 3dmark several times, and not to my surprise, I was getting a score of 4800, every time.
I ran futuremark sysinfo, and it alerted that there was no gpu chipset installed. I called Amazon, several times for a replacement, but since my zip code changed on my payment address, they couldnt issue a replacement, refund only. So I sent it back for a refund so I can order another one and now I am awaiting it to arrive back at Amazon.
Amazon customer service is out of this world, I talked to ten different agents who all bent over backwards trying to get a new laptop out to me right away, but Amazon security system would not allow it. They issued me a refund on the shipping immediately after I shipped it, and issued me a $40.00 Amazon credit.
The laptop only gets two stars because of the first impression, but Amazon gets five stars for excellent customer service.
UPDATE: Amazon customer service is awesome, he stayed there until midnight to make sure my replacement was sent out quickly, it was shipped at midnight and its out for delivery the same day.

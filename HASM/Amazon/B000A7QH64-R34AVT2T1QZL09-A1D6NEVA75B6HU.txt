Title: Nice Hand Vac
Content:
The hand vac is working great so far.  We read the instructions on how to charge and discharge the battery as well as other reviews on this subject and to date the battery holds up Great.  The only disappointment is that the color of the vac we received is not the green one that had been pictured, but rather grey.  Other than that the vac came to us in a very timely manner and overall I would buy it again if I was choosing today.

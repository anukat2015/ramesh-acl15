Title: The Netbook Solution
Content:
I've owned an HP 2133 MiniNote and an ASUS 1000HE but the Acer 1410 seems to be the perfect Netbook solution.  The size of the unit is not much larger than a 10.2" Netbook but the high resolution 11.6" screen makes this a joy to use for 50+ eyes.  The performance of the Core 2 Solo Processor is far superior to the Atom with only a slight decrease in battery life.  The battery life would be even better (8 hours rather than 6 hours) if the 5600 amp battery was made available here in North America like it is in Europe.  The 1410 is thinner than either of my other Netbooks and weights about the same.
Other pluses over the standard Atom Netbooks is that the 1410 accepts up to 4 GB of RAM and as the Core 2 Solo is a 64 bit processor, you can run a 64 bit operating system on it.  The keyboard is full size.  
On my other Netbooks I always felt I was giving up something, whether it was performance, screen resolution or a screen that could be used without eye strain.  On the 1410 there is no compromises, performance is great and it is a pleasure to work on even for a full day.  The 1410 is marketed as a Notebook rather than a Netbook because of the processor and operating system it ships with but in reality it is a Netbook on steroids.  The 1410 meets every one of my requirements without compromises and I've therefore rated it 5 stars.
Because retailers seem to list this in their Notebook rather than their Netbook category, the 1410 may be the best kept Netbook secret out there.  The 1410 is truly what the Netbook experience should really be, a small portable computing solution without compromises.

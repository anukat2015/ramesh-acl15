Title: Simple, elegant and good coffee too.
Content:
We wanted your basic auto-drip coffeemaker.  We got that, plus it looks great.
Pros:
 - simple operation, easy to program, easy to reset clock
 - great looks, in black goes well with our kitchen decor
 - very bright blue display light doubles as night light for the kitchen
 - easy to extract and insert carafe (problem with most pause drip units)
 - removable water tank. why don't they all come like this?
 - locking brew basket.
 - favor boost switch nice touch, but lengthens brew time a lot.
Cons:
 - opening the brew basket lid causes the condensation to drip down. Not a problem with basket and carafe in place. But if not there, drips significant water onto heating plate.
Overall, this is the best coffeemaker we have ever owned.  Average tasting coffee, simple operation and great looks for the price makes this an exceptional purchase.

Title: Leaks like a sieve...
Content:
After past experiences with Mr. Coffee products, I told myself I would never purchase another.  I should have "stuck to my guns".  After using this coffeemaker for just over one month, it now leaks from the bottom each time it's used...sitting in a pool of water.  Checking out Mr Coffee's FAQ...it seems that my only option is "send it in for service".  After only one month of use???    BEWARE!!!

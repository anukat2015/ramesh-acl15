Title: Total piece of garbarge
Content:
Yes, it was cheap----but ,oh, the pain it has caused. As  another reviewer said, it often just puts the water in the coffee filter and overflows. It doesn't really get hot enough. And, if it is like mine, it won't last you two months and will leave you some morning , caffeine deprived and seeking vengeance against toastmaster.

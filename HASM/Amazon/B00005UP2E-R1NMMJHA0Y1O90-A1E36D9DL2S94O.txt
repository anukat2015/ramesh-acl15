Title: It's OK
Content:
I bought this vacuum cleaner for the air filter because, at the time, it was about ... less than a HEPA filter vacuum. I also wanted to try a bagless vacuum cleaner. The suck power of this vacuum is good, but not about to pull up any carpet. I found that having a bagless is not all it's cracked up to be - especially since trash and dirt are affected by static electricity and don't always pour right out. Make sure you clean the filter outside -- banging it around inside the house will just put dust back into the air. The vacuum is compact and stores well. I'm a little displeased with the handles, though. I don't think they're air tight enough.3 stars means I'm satisfied, but when it's time to get a new vacuum I'll look for a different one.

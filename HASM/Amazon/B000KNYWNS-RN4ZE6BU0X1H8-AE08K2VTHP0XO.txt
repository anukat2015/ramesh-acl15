Title: Noise
Content:
The previous review was exactly right!  The water just hits the fan over and over again, making it almost impossible to sleep if you are hoping to cool off the bedroom.  Do not buy this unit.  The instruction booklet lists "water noise" as being among the acceptable noises that your A/C unit might make.  Find a different brand, this one just isn't worth it.

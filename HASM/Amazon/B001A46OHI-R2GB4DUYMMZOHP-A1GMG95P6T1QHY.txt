Title: Great little heater!
Content:
We have a similar Holmes heater in our master bathroom that works so well we wanted another one.  This is a newer model and it works every bit as well.  We use this one in our 10 x 12 hearth room off the kitchen.  It is on top of the TV cabinet and blows out into the room under the ceiling fan.  It raises the temperature in there from 68 to 72 degrees using only the 80 degree low power setting.  It only runs for about 1 minute every 15 minutes even when it's 12 degrees outside!  Our main furnace died during a 20 degree cold snap and we used it and the one from our bathroom to keep the entire 1500 sq. ft. first floor at 67 degrees for three days while we had a new funace installed.  Of course they were both on the 80 degree high power setting, but even then they didn't run constantly!

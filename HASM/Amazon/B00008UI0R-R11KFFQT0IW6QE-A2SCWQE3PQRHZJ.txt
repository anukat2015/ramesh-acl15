Title: Better than I thought
Content:
My main concern when looking for an affordable vacuum, was the dreaded cat hair issue, and Consumer Reports just giving it an OK, but I have to say it's working wonderfully! This is the first vacuum I've owned that pickes up cat hair this well. I have two types, the long hair tumbleweed type, and the short hair, digs into the carpet/furniture type. The Hoover picks up both kinds equally well. The complaints about having to empty the dust cannister often, is not a problem. As someone else pointed out, that just means it's doing it's job very well! A little messy, but still easier and less expensive that replacing bags. In case you can't tell, I highly reccommend it!

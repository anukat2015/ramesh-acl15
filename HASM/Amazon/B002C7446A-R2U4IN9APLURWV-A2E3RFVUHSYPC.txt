Title: don't fall for the "SPEEDY SHIPPING" option
Content:
I love the MacBook but not Amazon order fullfilment!
I placed my order (Product IN STOCK) with the "Saturday Delivery" option, but amazon CANNOT ship nor deliver the order as promised. They emailed me a sorry notice and "gladly" refunded the shipping charge. Big deal! You can't cancel nor change order at this time. And the web site continue to advertise next day or 2-day delivery when they know that they cannot do so. FALSE ADVERTISING. I called and nobody knew when or where the order was!!

Title: A Novice's POV: Amazing camera
Content:
I am definitely not a professional photographer, nor do I strive to be one, but have always been interested in these cameras.  I am a graphic design student, and I am planning on minoring in photography so I thought I might as well get one of these babies.
I've only had the Canon XSi for about a month, but what a month it has been!  I've quickly picked up on aperture, shutter speed and ISO, so I have a bit of an advantage over those who do not understand what they are.  I keep the camera on manual at all times.  I'm not much of a fan of auto-focus, even on my point-and-shoot, and this camera is not made for auto-focus.  
I only have two lenses so far: the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (comes with the camera) and the Canon 50mm f/1.8mm.  I keep the ISO at either 100 or 200, and the pictures turn out wonderful and noise-free.
The live view is great when friends are using the camera, but I prefer the view finder.  It help me keep the camera steadier.
Be prepared to spend a lot more on different lenses, a bag, and make sure to BUY LENS PROTECTOR FILTERS!  They're $7 here on Amazon, and it's better scratching those than dropping another $200 for a new lens.

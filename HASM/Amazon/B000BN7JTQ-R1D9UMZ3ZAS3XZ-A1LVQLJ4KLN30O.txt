Title: Not worth the Money
Content:
I am a serious coffee drinker and when my last single serve coffee maker finally died, I ordered this one.  After reading all the reviews I thought this sounds like a great coffee maker.  My new coffee maker arrived and I made a cup of coffee for the next day to take on my comute to work only to discover that my coffee tasted blah - hot water (just like one of the reviews stated).  When I did read that review I thought, well they didn't add enough coffee, so the next day I made another cup of coffee, I made sure to put more coffee grounds in the filter.  Well, to my dismay, blah - hot water again, but with just a hint of flavor.  For the amount of coffee you have to put in the filter to just get a good cup of coffee is not worth the cost of this coffee maker.  I returned this and ordered my old brand the Black and Decker Brew-N-Go.  Now this is a coffee maker, I should have just ordered it from the get go.

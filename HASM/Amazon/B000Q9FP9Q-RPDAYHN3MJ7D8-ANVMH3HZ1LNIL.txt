Title: Total CRAP!!!
Content:
Well if I could give a rating of less than 1 star I definatly would, the output is warm to hot air unless of course you dump a 5 pound bag of ice in the tray and some water, the highest setting is less powerful than the lowest setting on a $20 fan. A total waste of money, you need to be seated within 1 to 3 feet away from it to feel any kind of air from it. DONT waste your money on this junk.

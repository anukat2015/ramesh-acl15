Title: Nice feats, poor quality?
Content:
As others have said, nice machine, but the mousepad is quirky on mine too.  Support and quality do not seem to be hallmarks of Sony Vaios....I'll be returning mine for a full refund (only had a couple days).I'll probably buy IBM...have had many thru work, and they are almost always rock solid (if pricey).

Title: liked it at first...
Content:
we got this coffee maker as a xmas gift in 2006 and about 3 months ago had to have it replaced.  it all started as a small drip, then a bigger drip and then finally an entire 12-cup pot of coffee dripped all over my kitchen counter, down the cupboard and all over the floor.  so not amused.  we're going to give this next pot a chance, and if it still drips, we're giving up on cuisinart.

Title: love it
Content:
This is my favorite iPod.  Finding songs is a breeze as is downloading them.  Also like the applications, which make this more than just a music player.  WiFi is great for when you need to check email or something on the web.  It's very similar to an iPhone.  
The only problem I have with this is that it can take a lot of time, if you let it.  It's one of those things that you can pick up for "just a minute" and still be playing around with an hour or two later, especially when you first get it.  Lots of stuff to look at and more coming daily.
I think the 16 gig model may be a little too big, at least for me.  It holds A LOT.  Video and other new content is taking up more and more space though, so you might want to play ahead and go even larger, if you like that kind of thing.
This is a little more expensive than the other iPods, but if you're somebody who spends a lot of time online and want a nice way to do it, you will find it worth the money.  If you're just looking for something to listen to music with, it may be more than you need.

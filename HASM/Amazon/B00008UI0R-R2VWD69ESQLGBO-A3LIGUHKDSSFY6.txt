Title: Hoover Wind Tunnel
Content:
I really like this vacuum cleaner.  I have owned it for about a year now and it works great.  It has an excellent rug attachment that really pulls the dust and dirt out of the carpet.  I have mostly tile floors.  Even though it has a tile floor setting, many times I continue to use the rug setting as it picks up more things off of the bare floor.  If there is a lot of something on the floor, such as cat litter, you wouldn't use the rug setting because it may shoot the liter out from under the bottom, as the bar is off the ground a little bit.  However, I find that if I am doing something like cat litter, I turn off the power bar for carpet, vacuum a bit, then turn it on to get up that last bit of dust off the bare floor.  I'm very happy with it.  My only request on this model would be if they had included a plain dusting brush.  They do have a great little attachment for furniture with a little beater bar but I would have liked to have had a plain brush for dusting.  Other than that, I really have enjoyed it and it is working great one year later.  I love being able to dump the canister without changing bags.  Great product!

Title: Rebel xti kit
Content:
I'm what you call an amateur, so i'm just starting getting into the photografy world. Still, i think the camera is awesome, you have total control of time exposures, tones, focal lenghts, etc... it's very handy, gives you a lot of possibilities to your creativity and imagination. I got it with the lens kit 18/55mm, i trust with a better lens i'll be able to push it further in proffesionalism and and get sweater images but so far i'm very happy with my purchase, nothing to complain about! I'd say if you want it, go for it! 
Don't get me wrong, images are neat anyway, but they will be even better with finer lenses.

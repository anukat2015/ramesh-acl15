Title: Everyone is jealous!!
Content:
I bought this to use at work. Others have Ipods,or the little Shuffle ones. Some have just MP3 players. I really like the feature of being able to record off the radio reciever. I can then listen to what I want when I want. I also like the Photo storage. I havent tried the video clip feature yet....but will. It has met my expectations and others at work will be buying them for themselves. I have never had an MP3 player befor and found this to be very easy to use....without reading any directions. I was able to download all my CD's on it, and navigate through the menus and use it the first day I got it. If not for the charging and downloading I would have been up and running in less than 5 minutes. Highly recommend, great bang for your buck.

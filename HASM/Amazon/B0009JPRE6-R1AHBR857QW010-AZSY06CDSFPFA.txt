Title: I Love This Camera
Content:
I'm a pretty serious photographer - own a Nikon F5 and a F100, both film camera - and aside from a Nikon 5700 Coolpix, this is my first digital camera, and my first true D-SLR.  
I recommend this camera without reservation.  Although I liked the 5700 a lot, that type of camera does have some serious limitations, and after a while I realized I had to move on.  If you do decide to get this camera, I highly recommend getting the kit with the len included - it's a high quality lens, adequately fast, and works quite well with the digital sensor (remember there are some differences between digital and film lenses, primarily a 1.5x conversion factor).
Do not scoff at the "only" 6.1 MP - that's plenty for the vast majority or work.  I've made Super B prints that came out great.  One thought:  For some reason that I don't understand, apparently "regular" flashes don't work as well with digital cameras, although the little flash built into the D70s is excellent for simple fill flash.
If, like me, you have an investment in Nikon equipment, or are starting fresh, you'll be quite happy with the D70s.

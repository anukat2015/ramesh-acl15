Title: Amazing camera
Content:
This is a really great product, even 2 years after its launch. Ok, a new one may be available in a few months, but way more expensive. And this one is almost perfect!
the only bad experience I have is the write speed: it is "only" 9Mb/s. So wif you shoot many pix in a row, the bufer will be full and the camera won't be able to write fast enough on the card, even with an extreme III. To shoot without any trouble, you need to but the quality in jpeg (the better compression) and not raw.
Except this, it is a very good camera!

Title: Simple
Content:
The iPod Shuffle (2gb) is plenty of storage for music. I have about 8 hours, which is enough for the longest of car rides for me. I'm not one to change the music in the car often (unless its the radio) so even when I had my larger 20gb Creative... I would just put it on shuffle. And I never needed 20gigs of music. This is smaller and just as good quality wise.
Clip is strong enough to hold this on, it weighs maybe 2 ounces... so it doesn't take much. That being said, with the ear buds in, even if it falls, the ear buds keep it from dropping.
Casing is metal. Minus the buttons. I have no worries about dropping it... there's no moving parts/screen to break... all flash memory.
Its as simple as you can get. And I like simple.

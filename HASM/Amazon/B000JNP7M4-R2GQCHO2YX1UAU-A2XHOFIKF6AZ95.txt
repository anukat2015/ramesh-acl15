Title: Wonderful For Taking the Chill Off
Content:
I bought this heater because the house that I am renting has leaky single-pane windows and a heat pump that makes it feel like cold air is blowing on me in the winter.  I wanted a silent heater to put in the bedroom to take the chill off and allow me to turn the heat down to 52 at night.  In spite of the directions to put it on the floor, I put the heater on the nightstand.  It gives off enough heat to take off the "cold ear chill" coming through the four leaky windows in the room.  I never need to leave it on all night, even when it gets down to 20 degrees.  It only uses 400 watts and radiates off the side, not so much off the top like a 1500 watt Delonghi.  It's also perfect for next to the desk or the easy chair.

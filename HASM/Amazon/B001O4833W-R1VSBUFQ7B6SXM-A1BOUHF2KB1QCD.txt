Title: JUNK & a waste of money
Content:
I have a small apartment......came home turned my furnace down to 60 and then turned on the eden pure  ( fyi - i bought the bigger model)  it was on high and when I woke up in the morning I was freezing and the temp. was 60 degrees, I tried it a few days and still was not happy with it at all......lucky they let me return it, thank god cause very expensive.......BOTTOM LINE THESE SUCK DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY..........i like the oil filled radiator type and it was only $[...] bucks

Title: Novice Photo Enthusiast
Content:
I have not had it long, but recently took it to NAPA Valley and was surpised at the quality of many of my photos (I'm still trying to learn its features, so some shots were not as good as I expected.) Looking in the area for a class. I did find it cheaper (by nearly $200.00) and with more (especially an additional lense) included at two other sites, so do what I did not do . . . research for a better deal.

Title: so-so
Content:
This big item does not cool a big room very well.  Reminder: the BTU is only 8500 so it is recommended that you buy this item for a large bedroom or a small living room; otherwise your room will take forever to cool down.  
Half of the plastic grill that directs air vertically were delivered broken but it is such a big item to repack and return so I decided just to keep it to eleviate the burden.  I'm not sure if it was poorly packed or it was poorly delivered.....probably a bit of both.

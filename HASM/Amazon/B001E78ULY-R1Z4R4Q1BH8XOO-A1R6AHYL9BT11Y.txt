Title: Great little device
Content:
I purchased the E-matic MP3 player in Cherry Red for my 9-year-old son. It is a good little device that he can conveniently hide away in his backpack, and pull out to listen while he rides the bus.
The battery life is wonderful for the usage that he gives it, and it was easily charged/programmed with separate USB port. It does come with its own USB charging cord and headset, but I recommend a higher-end head set for better sound and comfort. The set that comes with the E-matic is inexpensive and my break easily, as we found out when got it caught in his backpack. 
With the exception of the vague instructions, I found this to be a wonderful MP3 player. The color is great, and the ease of navigation is acceptable after you get the hang of it.

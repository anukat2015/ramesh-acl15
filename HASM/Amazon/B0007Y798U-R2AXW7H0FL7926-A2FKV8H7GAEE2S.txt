Title: I love LoVe LOVE it!!!!!
Content:
I love my nano! 
im 13 and my mom ordered this off her account and im in love with it! 
I just got it today and i got the white one and i like it so much.
there is a GREAT sound quality and its as thin as listerine!!! (im exajurating) but its really super thin! 
Right now i only have 30 songs on it but i know i'm going to love it because of the great sound quality and just how mini this ipod can really get!!! 
I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO HAS A GREAT LOVE FOR MUSIC! 
good luck!!

Title: Love this Camera !
Content:
I bought this camera a couple of months ago and I could not be more satisfied.  I have enjoyed photography since I was very young~10 yrs old.  Now 35 years later the technology has come a long way and the enjoyment of taking a great shot is attained much easier with the sophistication of a great camera. This camera has many great features that provide quality shots like a pro at the price and simplicity for the enthusiast.  I think I will be enjoying this camera for a long time.

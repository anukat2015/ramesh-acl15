Title: Great Heater
Content:
I bought 2 of these Vornado heaters last year, 1 for me and the other as a gift for my brother. We both love them. The heat it puts out is like the heat you recieve from a vent from central heating, it blows a stream of warm air. Not like the heat from the cheap space heaters which is hot but doesn't circulate well into the room. It is very quiet, none of that buzzing you hear from other heaters I've tried.  I run it at 72 degrees in a 12 X 12 room and it definitely takes the chill out and creates a nice comfort zone. If you are looking for extreme heat source this is not the unit you want. I still have to run those nasty noisy electric heaters when I'm worried about pipes freezing. It does a fantastic job being used in room that is not ice cold but has a chill to it. I also use the fan only mode though the summer at my desk.

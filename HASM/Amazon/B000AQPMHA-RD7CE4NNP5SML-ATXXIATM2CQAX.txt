Title: great coffee, worth the price
Content:
In order to keep my review of short, the only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is related to its lack of longevity.I bought the B60 unit for my wife last Christmas and it died about 3 weeks ago.  Naturally, there is no simple way to get it repaired.  After sitting in the trunk of a car for the 3 weeks, I simply bought a new one, but figured I would get the less expensive model if I would have to replace it every year.  It does the same job and quite frankly it is worth purchasing a new one every year if necessary.  It is used at least 20 times per day and everybody gets their own favorite freshly brewed coffee or tea every time.  In my mind is worth the expense and I can follow up next year to tell you if this one lasted longer.

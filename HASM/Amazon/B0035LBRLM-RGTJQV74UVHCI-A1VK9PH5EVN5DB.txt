Title: Not compelling for a "pointer and shooter" or for a DSLR user
Content:
I tried this camera, both with its default lens and a much smaller "pancake" lens. I really wanted to like it, as it seemed an ideal combination of good quality and portability. 
Yes, the quality is good, but the portability isn't. It's too large and too small. 
Compared to a point-and-shoot camera, the E-PL1 is HUGE. You can't put it in your pocket. You need to carry a case, which meant for me I wouldn't take it all that often.
And when I do carry a case, I might as well take a full-size DSLR camera (such as my Nikon D-5000). The quality is better, and the user interface is far, far superior. The E-PL1 has an LCD display that is unusable in bright light. (You'd need to get the viewfinder which adds more bulk and cost). The controls are flimsy and useless when you can't see the LCD display. 
I am glad that the camera works great for some people, but I would caution anyone who is considering it to look at it in a store first.

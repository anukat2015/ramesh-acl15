Title: It's The Coolest Grind and Brew Gadget
Content:
I gave away at least 5 coffee makers within the last three years, including two first generation grind &amp; brew from Cuisinart.  When it first came out, the grinder part was very difficult to clean and dry.  It was also very noisy.  The thing startled us and our dog the first morning when we set it on automatic operation.This model is much easier to clean and dry.  It's also less noisy, however, I've learned not to set it on automatic.This one is definitely a keeper.

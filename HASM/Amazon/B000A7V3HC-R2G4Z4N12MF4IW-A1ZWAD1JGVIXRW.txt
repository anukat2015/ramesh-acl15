Title: Worth the money and super customer support
Content:
I bought my Miele in 2007 and I have had no problems with it -- and it's now 2010.  It works beautifully, is quiet, well designed,  and easy to operate.  Changing bags and filters is easy.  Everything seems to easily click and lock into place. I can't think of anything negative.
Today, I called customer support because I thought I had a problem.  Turns out I was just technically challenged and learned how to fix my problem after a quick, troubleshooting session with a highly personable, helpful, and competent agent.   What a joy; this is how customer support SHOULD work.  I would buy another Miele when this one dies - which doesn't seem likely anytime soon.

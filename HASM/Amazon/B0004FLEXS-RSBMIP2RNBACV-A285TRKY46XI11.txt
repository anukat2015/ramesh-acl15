Title: Good construction, bad coffee, poor electronics
Content:
We purchased this when our very basic - but excellent - Braun KF 510 stopped working after 4 years.   Unfortunately for us, the KF 510 seems to be discontinued, and we chose this as the replacement.  
Our machine is on its way back to Amazon because a) it was broken (the clock "reset" after every brew) and b) the coffee just wasn't very good (which is why it's a return for refund and not a return for replacement).  The coffee is barely warm (not hot) even directly after brewing.  I assume the lack of heat also has something to do with the weak coffee it produced.  
Pros:  Great Carafe design, easy to use, decent price.
Cons:  Faulty electronics (search the reviews for "clock"), coffee is weak and luke warm, red numerals on the clock are distracting (it makes you think it is "on").

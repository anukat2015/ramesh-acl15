Title: Excellent value
Content:
I have owned this camera for almost a year and so far the only camera in the same class that exceeds its performance is Nikon D300. But D300 costs almost twice as much as 40D. I can spend the money on a nice lens.
Everything about this camera is excellent in my experience, except for its LCD which is lame compared to D300. Try shooting in very low light condition and you will find out what I am talking about. Its Auto-Focus system is very good in dim light. 
Even after 1 year, I think I have used at the max 50% of the features of this camera (which is probably 25% of Nikon's). 
In other words, when you are looking for a DSLR, look for (1) Basic features: Auto-focus performance, noise-performance, (2) the supporting systems (Lens, flashes, software) - which at this point are dominated by Nikon and Canon.

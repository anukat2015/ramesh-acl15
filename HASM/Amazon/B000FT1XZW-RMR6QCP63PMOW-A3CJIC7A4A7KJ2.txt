Title: We Love This Thing!
Content:
We purchased our DeLonghi oil-filled heater in hopes we could use our gas furnace a little less.  It does that and more -- we hardly use the furnace at all anymore, and are more comfortable than ever.
 
One huge advantage of the DeLonghi is that it uses natural convection and radiant heating to warm both the air and the contents of the room it's in.  The furnace depends on blowing hot, dry air throughout the house, but the contents -- furniture, walls, etc. -- suck up a lot of that heat, so the furnace has to run quite a while at first.  The DeLonghi heats the air that flows past it, which circulates itself, but kind of like holding your hand in the sunshine you can feel heat from the DeLonghi radiating throughout the room, heating up the walls and furniture directly.
 
Besides the more comfortable heat, the DeLonghi is much cheaper to run simply because it doesn't heat the whole house like the furnace does.  We simply move the DeLonghi if we need to heat another area in the house, but usually it sits in the space between our 14x20 living room and our 12x24 dining room and kitchen area, which keeps virtually the whole main floor of our house comfortable.
 
We have experienced no odors whatsoever from our DeLonghi, and the click of the thermostat is so quiet my wife never noticed it until I mentioned it to her after reading some of the reviews here.  Obviously, there may be difference from one unit to another; if we'd gotten a stinky or noisy heater we'd have exchanged it immediately.  But I'd certainly recommend the DeLonghi to anyone who wants to reduce their heating costs while improving their comfort.

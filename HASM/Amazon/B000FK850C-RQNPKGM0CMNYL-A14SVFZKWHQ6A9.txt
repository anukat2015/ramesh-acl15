Title: Excellent heater - highly recommended
Content:
I bought this heater to warm a cold basement, as the central heat in my house does not extend there.  A few days after I got it, our oil burner started having trouble.  During the past week, between visits from the HVAC company, I have brought it back upstairs and have been using this heater to warm my entire house.  It warms a large area (with cathedral ceilings) surprisingly well and has allowed us to live in 15 degree outdoor temperatures without too much discomfort.  I also have 2 small DeLonghi SafeHeat units, which are great for small areas (bedrooms etc); so by combining this large heater with the 2 little ones we're getting by nicely even in the very cold weather.  Our oil burner is back in business; but it's nice to know that if it takes another vacation this heater is up to the challenge.

Title: Better off with IS
Content:
Just a few words on my first impression. The weight of autofocus lenses (at least my USM 28-105 3.5) makes for a challenging hold to maintain a rock-steady posture to take crisply sharp photos, especially at higher magnifications. I'm inclined to trade it in for an IS lense (yes, it is an additional $200+), but may be a virtual necessity. The extra cost in going SLR to me isn't worth comprising what your objective is in going from darn good point and shoot resolution (at least from my Olympus 4000)to the quality one expects from this upgrade. This rating doesn't reflect on the camera, just the photos taken without IS (yes, it is subjective). The camera itself has much potential.

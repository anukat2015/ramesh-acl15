Title: Great heater!
Content:
Bought this from Amazon.com. It boasts vertical hot air tunnels to maximize radiant heat flow while maintaining a low surface temperature. A little bit suspious about that initially. I owned a Homles for a month. Homles heater can raise a small bedroom temperature by 3F, and the embedded thermostat always show 85F(the max it can show) when the heater itself is heated up, while room temp is not raised yet. Totally bogus. I didn't expect the new Delonghi can be anything better because the  thermostat is on the unit, how can it do a good measure of room temperature? Delonghi turned out to be beyond my expectation. First, the thermostat seems to be more accurate to measure the room temperature. Second it can raise room temperature a lot more than Holmes, and faster. Finally my bedroom is so warm and I can get good sleep at night. I did a side by side comparison by turning both heaters on for a while, then put face above the heater to feel the air flow. For the Holmes, the best I can say is it feels warm above. For the Delonghi, man, the hot air is blowing to your face and your can even hear the flow. Unbelievable! The vertical hot air tunnel is realy doing some magic. The outside surface is really cooler than Holmes. I decided to return the Holmes to Target and buy another Delonghi.

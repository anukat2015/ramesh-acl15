Title: This is the good one!
Content:
While the newest 6G iPod Classic offers some new features and a slim profile, this older 5.5G iPod is the best one currently available (12/24/07).
With a Wolfson DAC, a component not featured in new "classic" iPods, this 80GB iPod features the sound quality that made iPod a viable music listening platform. It also has a bright screen, good battery life, and the ability to play videos, photos, songs, games and more! It plays entire albums flawlessly with no gaps between tracks, a problem that plagued older iPods for years.
Finding a good deal on this unit is the best possible 80GB iPod purchase you can make until Apple hopefully fixes the 6G iPod sound problems. Let's keep our fingers crossed for the upcoming 7th generation.

Title: pretty package, disappointing software
Content:
The other negative/mediocre reviews have already pretty much said it.  Itunes is buggy, and Apple is trying harder then ever to force people to use it.  The new UI and click wheel are kind of clunky, although they look pretty.  Sound and picture quality are fine, but there are other players out there that are just as good without the annoyances that come with the new Ipods.  I traded mine in for one of the new creative zen players, and haven't regretted it.

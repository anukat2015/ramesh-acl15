Title: Moving up with the Nikon D40x
Content:
I class myself as an advanced hobbyist with regards to photography. In the past, I have used Nikon Pro-grade film cameras such as the F-3 and FM-2. Like many people, I started out slow with digital photography because a lot of the "experts" said it wouldn't last. About a month ago, I bought a Nikon D40x w/Nikkor 18-135 lens and have found it to be a wonderful camera. It has enough features to keep the advanced hobbyist interested and yet is simple enough for a beginner. The menus are easy to navigate through and because I didn't have any AF lenses, I don't care that there is no servo (focusing motor) in the body. As with all Nikkor lenses, the quality is first class. The D40x has a built in flash but for serious lighting issues, I would recommend one of the more powerful Nikon Speed lights. All in all, I am very satisfied with the D40x and would recommend it to anyone ready to move up from a point and shoot camera.

Title: It's ok not that great/not what I thought
Content:
After using the laptop for several days, it's ok although I expected alot more with speed because it has the new intel i3 chip.  It takes along time to boot up and the DVD combo drive is noisy.  I thought I was getting an excellent product with the Toshiba brand, I researched alot of others but because I've had other Toshiba brand electronics I tried to stay loyal to the brand.  My son has a Dell and his is far better with speed and quietness and his laptop doesn't even have the new intel chip.  When your're reading the product details online it leaves you to believe that this is the best of the best.  I'm alot disappoointed.

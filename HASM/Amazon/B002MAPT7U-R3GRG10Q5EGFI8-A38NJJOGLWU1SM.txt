Title: Love the Sansa Clip+ 4
Content:
Small product with big capacity and great sound.  I use it mostly to listen to audible books and newspapers and I have no problem moving back and forth to listen again to anything I want contrary to someone's earlier comments.  
My only problem was I thought it wasn't working initially but found the Sansa player and [...] were just not compatible with only version 9 of windows media player installed on my computer.  Easy solution was for me to just run the free update to version 10 of windows media player.  I also thought Rhapsody would be of some benefit but have found I don't need/use it however, if you want to buy music it appears cheaper than some other sources.
Its a real bargain for what it does and an excellent replacement (10 times lighter and displays the book titles and progress) if you are still using the old Audible Otis to listen to books, etc.

Title: Coffee done right!
Content:
Excellent coffee brewed swiftly and piping hot! The warming plate is designed intelligently and gently maintains an even temperature, a "fresh (tasting) cup" is available 40 min after brewing has concluded. I especially appreciate the clean design and the brew basket removes for easy (and complete) clean-up.

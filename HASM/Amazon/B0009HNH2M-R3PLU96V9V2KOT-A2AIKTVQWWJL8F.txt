Title: Very Good, but still not excellent
Content:
I researched a lot online and read many reviews trying to find the perfect cansiter. I needed something for carpets and hardwood floors, that would go under the bed all the way.
This one does a gr8 job on carpet, couldn't wish for better, but does not do so well on floor. It did not pick up all the litter that was scattered from my cat's litter box!! I expected more there. 
One other problem, is the black rubber around the piece that does the carpet and floor has fell off from one side after using it for just 2 times!!! Def. expected more there. However, I'm not even considering returing it, coz of the unbelievable job it does on my carpet. Its heavy to push a little put still lighter than my last one. For its price.. i still like it very much. Amazing suction, my carpets are bare foot clean!!

Title: The real taste of Starbucks at home.
Content:
If you are like me, you might have said this refrain from time to time: "Why can't I make Starbucks coffee taste as good at home as it does at Starbucks?" I've said this almost every time I've brewed their coffee. Based on these reviews I bought this Bunn coffee maker when our old one crapped out. To my surprise almost any coffee I brew in it tastes as good as Starbucks own brewed coffee. Although it's not a "GREEN" coffee maker, I'm willing to pay the price of the eternal flame that keeps the reservoir of water hot. The taste is just superb.

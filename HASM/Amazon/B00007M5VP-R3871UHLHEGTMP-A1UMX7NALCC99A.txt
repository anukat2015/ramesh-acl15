Title: Great compromise between power and price
Content:
I've owned this laptop for about a month now, and am very impressed. The extra memory and large hard drive make it a bargain if you hunt around for the best price ...The CD burner isn't fast, but for personal use I don't think it makes a lot of difference. Plays DVDs with no problems whatever. And, by the way, in the box I found a coupon to get a USB floppy drive free after rebate from HPshopping.com (expires in early June). No complaints here!

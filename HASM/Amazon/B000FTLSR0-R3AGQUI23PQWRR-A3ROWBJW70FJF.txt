Title: I LOVE IT!!!!
Content:
I love this camera. It was a no brainer for me because I currently own 9 vintage Pentax Takumar lenses (and I'm still always looking to collect more). It has excellent build quality, reflecting on Pentax's history of solid cameras (I also own a Pentax Spotmatic film slr from the 1960's). The camera is very user friendly (although in the menu's, some of the abbreviations that Pentax uses for some of the functions are REALLY, REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT!!!!! ARGGGGGGG!!!!!). That is my only gripe though. The camera has manual focus indicator for my old screwmount Takumars and plenty of dipotre adjustments to help with proper focusing, which helps someone with glasses like me (the manual focus indicator seems to be a little nitpicky sometimes, so you have to have patience, especially in certain lighting situations; that is what I have observed). The camera is solid, with a steel chasis and polycarbonite plastic body and super awesome grip. It uses 4AA batteries which I LOVE and SD memory. You will need to download the latest firmware upgrade to it so it will accept SDHC cards (high capacity SD memory basically) which was really easy to do. I could go on and on and on about this camera.... Buy it! Especially if you have vintage Takumar lenses and are unsure about stepping into the digital realm. You won't regret it!

Title: Almost (not quite) the perfect notebook
Content:
I have an iBook 2001 (DVD-CDRW), which is the fifth in a long line of Apple laptops over the years I have owned (PowerBook 140, 520c, 3400, Rev.A iBook before this). I've also owned quite a few Wintel notebooks of various stripes over time, as well.With the combination of size, ruggedness, expandability, and performance that Apple squeezed into the latest iBook, it's darn near the perfect laptop. It's a very nice good performer with the 500 MHz G3 processor. CD burning with the combo drive is as transparent as can be - the included Disc Burner software extends the Finder to support CD-R. DVD playback performance is good, with minimal skipping (I haven't done too much playback thus far). Video performance is snappy, if not quite state-of-the-art (it uses the older Rage 128 rather than the newer GeForce 2Go) - games are nicely playable. And the 12.1&quot; display is razor-sharp. Video mirroring works very well, and the VGA cable needed is included. The iBook will work with the lid shut when mirrored.The only shortcoming comes when stressing the system heavily (for instance, with the included MacOS X 10.0.4) - the 66MHz data bus becomes the most glaring bottleneck. Though Apple includes more features pound-for-pound (and dollar) than competing Wintel notebooks, the competition has pretty much moved on to the 100MHz bus at the low end. It does make a difference.Unfortunately, Apple is caught between a rock and a hard place in this regard - with G4 processors constrained in speed (to 500 MHz max on their Powerbook Titanium), it'd complicate things to have the iBook running at the same exact clock rate (despite the older G3). So Apple chose to constrain things further - and it's not a huge problem, though hopefully the next generation of iBook will leave this bottleneck behind.  A larger hard drive as standard equipment would be nice, too - most Wintel vendors make the hard drive easy to swap out (even in lower-cost models), whereas the iBook requires a full disassembly to do the same.All in all, I'd strongly recommend the 2001 iBook to anyone looking for maximum portability for a very competitive price. The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is the slow system bus - hopefully the improved performance planned for MacOS X 10.1 will compensate for it.

Title: Serious photography enthusiast? Look no further
Content:
I started photography with my Vivitar(SLR) 3800N manual(7 years back), later spent some time with Canon S2 IS(point & shoot) but once the Canon got the black screen of death wanted to get some serious equipment. 
My requirements were - 
1. 10+ Megapixel CMOS imaging Censor. I don't print pictures too often but do so occasionally. 
2. I wanted to get two lenses(with VR/IS option), one in the 70-100 mm range(daily use) and the other in the 100-450 mm range(wildlife/birds).
3. Low noise images even at higher ISO(1600+).
4. Built-in image sensor cleaning ability. 
5. Easily accessible dials and buttons with which I can change the settings quickly without going into the menu every now and then. 
6. Fast autofocus even in low light conditions. At the end of the day, manual focus can be a real pain for a good number of scenarios. 
7. Fast continuous shooting mode with the ability to shoot 4+FPS.
8. All the above including the two lens within $1500. 
9. Live view was not a must have but a good to have feature. 
Because of the bad experience with Canon I was pretty much predetermined to go with Nikon. D300 was pretty much out of my budget range so D90 was the only option if not D5000. I went through numerous review's and all suggested that D90 is packed with about 80% of D300 features. The only thing I was worried about is the D90 HOT PIXEL's issue, but I was well aware that the issue was not limited to D90 only, several other DSLR's including Canon DSLR's have those issues. 
I finally ordered my D90(with kit lens) in Nov'09 and have used it for two major trips so far, the results were awesome. The lenses used were the kit lens 18-105mm VR and the 70-300mm VR. 
Pros - 
1. Low noise even at higher ISO(1600+)
2. Excellent image quality with vibrant colors. I usually shoot at +1/+2 saturation.
3. White balance is an excellent feature if exploited properly.
4. Exposure is handled quite well if switched properly between Matrix, Center weighted and Spot metering. 
5. 3-inch LCD monitor, you would appreciate the results right after you have captured them.
6. The viewfinder is bright and easy on the eyes. You can go shooting without the live view for hours.
7. You gotta live with the fact that the kit lens ain't a prime lens but can produce some stunning results. 
8. Auto D lighting is a pretty cool feature.
9. Overall a camera with exceptional customization provisions to take your creativity to the next level if you understand the basics. 
Cons- 
1. Live view really needs improvement. By the time it focuses the subject will be gone. If u turn live view on and give the camera to a novice to take your snap both the camera and novice will be in trouble. Canon 50D does a far better job.  
2. No autofocus while capturing video's is primitive. If there is a model with no video and a few dollars cheaper I would have chosen that. 
3. Even with a Sandisk class 10 SD card(30mbps transfer rate) I really couldn't get 4.5 FPS beyond a certain number of shots. 
Final Package bought- 
1. Nikon D90 with 18-105mm VR kit lens.
2. Nikon 70-300mm VR.
3. 2*Tiffen 67mm UV Protection Filter.
4. SanDisk 16GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card.
5. One extra EN-EL3E 2000mAh Li-ion Battery .
6. Lowepro Flipside 300 backpack.
Hope my review will help others in determining whether D90 suits them. Can check some of my sample pictures @ http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/AZQYZRD46DCC9

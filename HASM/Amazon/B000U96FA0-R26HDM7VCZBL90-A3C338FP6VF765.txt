Title: Read the Warning Label
Content:
When they say do not plug into an extension cord, they really mean it.  Problem is, I did not read it.  How often does any one read the label on an everyday product?  First had it plugged into an extension cord in the living room.  This lasted for a couple of days till on evening I heard a pop and smelled smoke. The cord was on fire.  After testing the heater in the wall socket like someone suggested it worked so ofcourse I figured it was the cord and not the heater. I plugged it in again into a surge protector. (I ride the little yellow bus;)) What happened, I'm sure you are wondering.  Needless to say it now remains unplugged.

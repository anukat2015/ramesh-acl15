Title: MT500 DOES overflow and gets worse over time.
Content:
Sorry, I am a coffee snob and did a lot of research.  I was torn between the MT500 and Technivorm.  I went for the Capresso due to the metal parts and filter.  After 3 years, I can't wait to throw it in the trash.  There is nothing worse than overflowing coffee.  If it hasn't happened to you just wait.
I have ordered a Technivorm.

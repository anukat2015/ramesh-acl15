Title: Stops Working after One Year, Poor Customer Support
Content:
This unit stopped working after one year. Even when it was working, it through sparks on start up, making it of questionable safety: I was reluctant to leave it on at night or unattended. DeLonghi will not replace it if it is over one year old, and any repair would cost more than the unit itself. If you have bought this unit, I would recommend returning it before the warranty ends. Delonghi is well aware of the reliability issues with this heater.

Title: AMAZING FOR BEGINNERS
Content:
im a beginner photographer and i just started my business this year, ive owned this camera for a year its features are awesome and there are never enough lens for this camera! i take awesome pictures and i can print them up to 16x24 and there SUPER clear, i just dont like using it in live mode if its not bright outside, i do not use it inside, the shutter speed is slower its kinda blurry. its awesome camera tho

Title: A waste of money...
Content:
What does it mean when you buy a product which says in bold white italicized letters, "NEVER LOSES SUCTION", and it does? Is it false advertising? Sure seems so to me.
I own this little marvel, and purchased it based on those three little words. I feel cheated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

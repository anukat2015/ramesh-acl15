Title: Great camera, LOUSY LENS
Content:
We are very happy, as point-and-shoot parents wanting quality pictures of our kids, with the camera proper.  The 18-55mm lens worked very well for about 17 months.  Suddenly, without any preceding maltreatment, the auto focus wouldn't work.  I couldn't move the lens through the whole zoom range and I could hear something loose inside the lens.  Eventually, a piece looking something like a plumber's wrench fell out of the lens.  The Canon warranty is only for 12 months and they are asking $95 to repair it.  Buyer beware.

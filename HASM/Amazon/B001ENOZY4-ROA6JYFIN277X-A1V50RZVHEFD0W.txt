Title: Great camera... poor customer service...
Content:
The camera freezes while shutting. No button will unfreeze it. Removing the battery and turning it back ON works. Call Nikon customer service after 2 weeks of buying the camera. They just ask you to send in the camera for repair (shipping paid by customer, nice policy...) and they wont send it back for 10 days. Like one is supposed to have spare cameras in case a 900 dollar camera fails...
Otherwise the camera would be great.

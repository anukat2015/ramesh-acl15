Title: Nice Performer

We purchased this to supplement the heating in our house (natural gas).  As info, we purchased the DeLonghi Mica Panel last year and find it easy to use and also recommend it.   The only drawback of the Mica Panel unit is the inability to direct the heat with airflow.  The Vornado is easy to use and very portable.  In a bedroom or kitchen, it heats up the space in about 15 to 20 minutes. In the bathroom, it heats up in about 5 mins.   Our kitchen is separate from the rest of our house and the only part which sits on a concrete slab, (hence it is the coldest room in the winter), especially the floors.   We can enjoy our breakfast bar and also easily prepare and work in the kitchen by placing this strategically in the room.  It warms up the area you are working and directs the airflow where you are seated or standing.  Our house is 1,984 squarefeet with 1,100+ on the main floor and a walkout completely finished basement below.  Our bedroom is 14 x 15, the kitchen is similar in size, so our review is based on the performance in these spaces. In the heating mode it has 2 settings, which both have a small gentle fan blowing the heat. It is quiet and easy to move.  it is not too hot to move or touch.

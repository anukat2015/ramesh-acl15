Title: Bunn is simply the best.
Content:
After 5 years, our last Bunn was retired. We purchased this one to replace it and can't be happier. Some of the complaints I've seen on these reviews are ridiculous (high energy costs, coffee not warm, etc.). Don't know anyone who has ever had a problem with a Bunn. Best, quickest, tastiest coffee maker on the market. Enjoy!

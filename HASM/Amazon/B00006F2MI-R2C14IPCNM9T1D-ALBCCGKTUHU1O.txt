Title: Overly Complex Design
Content:
Coffee makers with a built-in grinder are a good idea.  I bought this one to replace a Toshiba model that served us well for many years and made great coffee.  In the Toshiba the grinder was in the filter basket allowing you to control the coarsness of the grind by setting the grinding time with a little spring-loaded timer.  This Cuisinart has separate grinder and filter basket so the grinder has to blow the ground coffee into the filter basket as well as grind it.  Because of this, you have no control over the grind.  You also have more parts to clean.  Other pros and cons of this machine are well stated by other reviewers.  Bottom line: It makes mediocre coffee.  It's not worth the money.  Buy a separate coffee grinder to use with your coffee maker if you have to.  Back to the drawing board, Cuisinart.  I want my Toshiba back.

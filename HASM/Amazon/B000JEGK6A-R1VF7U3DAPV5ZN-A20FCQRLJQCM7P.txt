Title: only good for personal heater
Content:
Don't buy this Sunpentown SPT SH-1507 if you are using it to heat an area its only good for personal heater.  Heat comes out ok but very poor projection only 2ft after that you can't feel anything.  Using this unit in 10x12 bathroom it does not do the job at heating it you can't even feel it unless you are next to it.  Not what I expexted, I don't understand why so many people rated this high.

Title: Product works great!
Content:
I was looking for an affordable canister vacuum that worked well mostly on hardwood floors but also on small area rugs. This vacuum does a great job with both. The vacuum is easy to maneuver, has good suction and a long cord.  I would prefer that the hose separate more easily from the end piece because I tend to remove the end piece often to get the dust in all the crevices and ledges. Overall, I would say that I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend this vacuum (at least for a small (2 bedroom) apartment like mine.)

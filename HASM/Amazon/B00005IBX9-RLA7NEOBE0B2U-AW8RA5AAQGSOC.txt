Title: Great Coffeemaker!
Content:
Been using the DCC-1200 for about 2 weeks now.  I can't believe what some people have been complaining about - this thing just works!  After reading many of the reviews only 2 things concerned me - not being able to see how much water you're putting in the reservoir (yes, I admit it, I fill it up with kitchen faucet hose) and excessive water pouring out the back when you lift the top lid.  I'm happy to report that the model I received has improvements that minimize and/or eliminate these issues.  Not sure if I have a new/improved model but it has bright, white, horizontal # markers on the inside of the reservoir which are very easy to see and tell exactly how much water you put in.  Second, there's a small lip on the backside of the coffeemaker so when you lift the lid (and do it quickly) most of the water flows into this lip and back into the coffeemaker.  A couple of drops do make it onto the counter but hey, it's water!, so it evaporates in a few minutes.  
This does exactly what it's supposed to do - make coffee!  I like my coffee on the strong side so I'm still experimenting with it to get the perfect cup but it's already pretty darn close.  Highly recommended!!!

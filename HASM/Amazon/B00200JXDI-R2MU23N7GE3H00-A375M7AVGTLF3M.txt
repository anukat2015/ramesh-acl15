Title: Very Dependable!!! Button color fades
Content:
When I first decided to purchase the Centon Craze, I was attracted to it because of its cost and size of flash. At the same time, I wanted something that was durable and had a quick learning curve. I read the previous reviews from different websites and realized that every device has its pros and cons. It is a cheap device, its menus tend to be a little difficult to navigate, and one of the seven colors used in the navigation has burned out. I'm a consumer that tends to be a little "rough" with his electronics, but seeing the icons on this mp3 player fade has been my only disappointment. Excessive use on my behalf toward this device has shown me that things like button fading occur. But by the time this occurred (purchased in November, faded in December) I was comfortable with the loss and its nothing difficult to remember. I really like the clip because it easily supports the weight of the player and its so light, its incognito.
Pros: Radio playback, mp3 playback, price, startup quick, lightweight, small, has a magnet to attach to belt
Cons: I did read somewhere that this device was capable of recording the radio, noncustomizable equalizer
Basically it is a device where "what you see is what you get". Its cheap, great for workouts because of size, simple. Make sure you equip yourself with some nice headphones, i'm a fan of behind-the-ear headphones, so the earbuds included collect dust

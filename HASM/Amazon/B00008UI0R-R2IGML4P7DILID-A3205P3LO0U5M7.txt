Title: Pleased with my purchase
Content:
This vacuum cleaner does a great job cleaning the hardwood floors, and a FANTASTIC job getting all the pet hair off upholstery.  I was concerned that it might be noisy but as soon as I turned it on and began using it, those fears slipped away.  There is a way to increase the suction of the vacuum, and when you increase suction it does get a little louder, but it is nothing like other upright vacuums I've had previously.  As others have stated, the collection source needs to be emptied often, especially if you are getting up pet hair. But that's a small price to pay for a job well done. I would definitely recommend this product, great buy for the $$.

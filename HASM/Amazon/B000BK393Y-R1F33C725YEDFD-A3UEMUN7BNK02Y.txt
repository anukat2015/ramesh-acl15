Title: This Camera is LOADED
Content:
After doing my reseach I purchased the Evolt e-500! I was very excited about this purchase. Here is what I liked about it!
1) Large LCD Screen
2) It came with 2 lense's
3) It has so many neat settings
4) It felt nice in my hands.
5) The construction was very nice!
6) I like the 2 card option!
Okay now for what I didn't like!
1) I am new to Digital slr's and really didn't like the low light focus issues. The camera kept spiting out flash to help aid the focus. This I could work with as I think many digital SLR's do this in low light. 
2) The LCD screen was really bright and the images were not sharp. I have a friend who is a Pro and had the same problem with the E-500 that he purchased. 
I returned the camera within 24 hours to the store. I think that I just happened to get one with a bad LCD screen and desided not to get another. Someday I might buy one again but not at this time.
I have a few Canon Lenses and film body and desided to go with a Canon D10 body and I am purchaseing an ef 28-135 IS lense. 
I do think the E-500 will be alot of fun for whoever purchases it but at this time it's not the camera for me.

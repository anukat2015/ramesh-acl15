Title: Swedish model
Content:
I have owned an electrolux vacuum for over 30 years and recently decided to buy a new one (by the way the old one still works) and have been doing research for the last week when I came across this product.  I was surprised that it did not look like the typical electrolux vacuum(which has the same basic look for years).  This product is made by Electrolux in sweden and it is hard to find parts because Electrolux USA is not involved with this vacuum.  That is why you are having trouble finding parts.  By the way - Electrolux USA has changed its name to Aerus/Electrolux and still has the same quality vacuums as the one I own.  I have been told that the Oxygen is a good product but since it is not made by the same electrolux USA company people are mislead into believing that they can go to any Electrolux dealer for service which isn't so.

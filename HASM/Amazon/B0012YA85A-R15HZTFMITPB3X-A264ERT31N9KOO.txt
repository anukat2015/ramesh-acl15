Title: Canon Eos rebel XSi
Content:
Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black)
This is quite a good camera for the price, and the lens is GREAT value with
good wide angle and zoom capabilities.  One review I read before buying the camera said it was intuitive to operate.  Not for me!  It came set up so the LIVE VIEW feature, which shows the shot to be taken on the screen, was not defaulted, so the the QUICK START instructions were useless, and only after deep reading of the operating instructions did i work out what was going on.
Also this only operates on "manual" modes, not on any of the automatic modes.  So a lot steeper learning curve than I'd expected.

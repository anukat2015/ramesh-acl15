Title: It is what it is and that is not a vacuum cleaner
Content:
I took a look at these reviews and found either people liked it or really hated it.  But I bought it anyway as I have tons of wood and tile floors that i hate dragging out the Bissell with all the attachments to clean.
My problem is my floors get a layer of dust and dog hair on them in between bigger cleanings.  It's not like those commercials on info TV where they pour a bunch of bolts and watch how they suck them up with their sweeper of choice.  i mean who does that?
After getting this home and getting it charged up-- I was pretty pleased with it.  
1) It is fun to use!  How many vaccuums can you say that about.  It floats, it hovers, it's like nothing else.
2) It does work.  Ok, the power isn't going to suck up the cat along the way but for little daily sweeping to get the dust, hair dirt and dog food up -- it works fine.  I was amazed at the amount I emptied out after one use -- and this after thinking "I'm not sure this is doing anything."
3) It is cordless.  This is a BIG plus.  You can zip around with this thing floating all over and get done really quick.
So it is what it is -- a dirt devil on a stick.  It's like the equivalent of those Roomba vacuums except you are the robot and there isn't a plastic thing wandering around your house for 3 hours bumping into everything.
Use it on hard floors for those in between cleanings and you will be really satisfied.  I found it on sale at a local store and took a chance.  I'm glad I did.

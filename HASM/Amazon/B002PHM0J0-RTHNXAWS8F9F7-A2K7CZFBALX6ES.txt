Title: Love it, though there is room for improvement!
Content:
This baby runs so quite!(in comparison with my previous laptop, Vaio is superb!) Out of box experience is great! lightweight! 
Downside: battery hour is only 2.5hours, and not even 1 minute more!(don't try your luck if you need a long battery hour laptop!# 
          surface smugs easily, but perhaps I should buy a white one, so it's not that obvious#mine is black#
          motive eye not as good as I expect, but those see me on skype says it's ok.
          not enough USB #only 3, even less than my previous "old tank")
          shipping is one day late! (but no big deal if you are not as eager to have it as I did!)
Hope the price won't drop too quick, I hate to see whatever laptop I bought drop the price soon after I get it.

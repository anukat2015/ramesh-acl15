Title: Michael Manna from T4 Show
Content:
Length:: 4:26 MinsMy name is Michael Manna and I host the T4 Show. It's a site that covers all technology news as well as performing podcasts and videos. I just received my MacBook Pro today and shot a quick tour. I haven't had a chance to fully review it yet, but I want to make a comment about Amazon Prime. It is the BEST. I ordered the MBP with 1 day shipping for $3.99 on Saturday, assuming it would be delivered on Tuesday. It arrived Monday before 10am. This is not the first time that has happened. I am a huge proponent of Amazon Prime, especially for Christmas shopping. Now I can play with my new MacBook Pro and not get bumped and shoved at the malls. Prime is the best!

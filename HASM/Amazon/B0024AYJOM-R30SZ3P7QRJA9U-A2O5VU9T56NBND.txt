Title: Amazon couldn't close the deal
Content:
In a departure from their usual brilliant service, Amazon (marketplace) scores an "F" on this item.  I had been looking for this model after two great reviews (by CR and Cooks Illustrated) which both ranked it the #2 coffeemaker among available models.  Amazon showed it out of stock for 2 days; then just in time for xmas, they had a marketplace seller listing it IN STOCK on 15 Dec - 10 days to xmas, delivery promised between 21 and 24 Dec.  IT TOOK "NEWMALL" AND AMAZON SEVEN DAYS TO TELL ME THEY WERE ACTUALLY OUT OF STOCK.  Effectively preventing me from finding any other vendor with items left in stock in time to ship by xmas.  In 2009 there is no excuse for more than 12-24 hrs lag in inventory.  And even that long is arguable given current technology.  Thanks Amazon/Newmall, outstanding holiday performance.  I will never again purchase from Newmall.  And I will seriously reconsider before I return to Amazon-proper.

Title: The Vacuum Really WORKS!!!
Content:
The Hoover was recommended by others at this site and I'm so glad I purchased it.  It came quicker than I had anticipated, thanks AMAZON! and it is really great!  A friend paid about $600 for a European made vacuum and this one has all the same features and performs just as well!  I really like that it has a variable speed switch so you can make the suction really strong or soft, depending on what you need.  Also the on/off button is on the handle too, another convenience I hadn't expected.  I have a hardwood floor in most of the house and the head for the floor is very wide so it takes less time to get the job done.  The power head for cleaning the carpets is very strong!  The only part that is not first rate is the bagless.  It is messy to clean however you can always have excellant suction as long as you're willing to empty the dirt out and shake the filter!  I love this machine and highly recommend it!!!

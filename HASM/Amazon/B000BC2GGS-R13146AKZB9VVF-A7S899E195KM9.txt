Title: Excellent Heater
Content:
I bought two of these babies when they were still available in October for $55 a piece.  Using these at each end of the house to offset the cost of oil.  Would like to tell everyone worried about their electric bill that I just got my first electric bill after using these for 1 month.  It was $70 higher than normal monthly electric bill (using two of these), so that would be about $35 per unit constantly running and reading 70 degrees Fahrenheit on it.  Sure helps keep the cost of oil down.  These are just wonderful!

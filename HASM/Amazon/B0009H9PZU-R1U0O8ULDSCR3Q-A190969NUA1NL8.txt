Title: Piece of Junk
Content:
I gave it a rating of 1 because that was the lowest choice available. Amazon didn't give me the option of a negative number.  I received my first (of 3) as a gift & it lasted about 1 month before it completely froze up & stopped working.  Because one corner of the cover refused to stay down, I optimistically hoped that it had been dropped and damaged in the store or in shipment, so I replaced it with an identical model.  2nd one worked for 11 months before it stopped working.  Since it was under warranty for 1 more month, I sent it back.  Whether iRiver replaced it with a new one or repaired the old one, I don't have a clue.  I just received a player back from them without any explaination about what was done.  It worked for about 2 months, before it stopped working.  No attempts at resetting or reformatting have worked.  So now all I have basically is a $300 paperweight.  I will never buy from iRiver again.

Title: Zune Not As Good As Nano
Content:
I needed an MP3 player to wear on my arm for bicycling and working out. I have a 1st gen Ipod that is huge and impractical. The technology has gotten so much better that the Zune 8GB is about 1/5 the size of my 10GB Ipod. And my Ipod doesn't play vids and has a black and white display.
I checked out what was out there in very small MP3/vid/FM stereo players I narrowed it down to the Zune, Ipod Nano and the Sansa View. I already had an Ipod and I wanted to try something new.
When opening the box you see the incredible cutting edge marketing that was involved in competing with Apple. So I was initially blown away by opening up the package.
But then I got into comparing some of the features and the Ipod Nano started looking better. I was like - where is the EQ on the Zune . . . there is none! The Nano has EQ and you can play TV shows and output to your TV with it. You have to watch all your video sideways on the Zune and then the controls work differently because it is on its side. Also, I went to buy and arm band for the Zune so I could ride bike and work out and there is nothing out there. And if you want peripherals and speakers and stuff, it seems like everything is made for the Nano. 
And the software interface of Itunes is so much better than Zune.
So I took back the 8GB Zune and got the 8GB Nano. 
Ignore the stars above I give it 3 stars.

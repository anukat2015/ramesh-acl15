Title: Great Vacuum for Hardwood Floors
Content:
I was looking for a vacuum for our hardwood floors. We have a 2300 sq. foot home and the only carpet is on the stairs. I purchased a Miele vacuum for $1200.00 and it did an okay job. I'm sure the Miele would do a bang up job on carpets but their floor tool is lacking. This Dyson has a few problems such as it does not follow you, it viers to the left. I'm constantly trying to keep it from banging into walls and getting it unstuck from furniture corners. The wand also spins and trys to kink.  Since I don't use the stow away feature there is no place to hook the wand. Other than that the vacuum power is great. It even picks up the little tiny black dog hairs that the Miele would leave behind. I like not having to buy bags. With the few problems that it has, I would still recomend this vacuum.

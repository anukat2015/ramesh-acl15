Title: Beats a Dyson Hands Down!
Content:
We have owned a dyson for the past 4 years ( the expensive pet hair one )  I received this vacuum and put it together.  Then proceeded to try it out on our living room.  We used to use that carpet powder that makes your carpet smell good several years back.  Well this Bissell was picking this up from deep in our carpet something that the Dyson never could I guess.  Its almost like the Dyson would push the powder into the carpet.  This is a very good vacuum!

Title: No Better than iPod!
Content:
I was so excited when I got my new Zune in the mail.  I recently sold my iPod because it was so incompatible with Walmart music downloads (88 cents to iTunes 99!), windows media player, and all my other music software.  I decided to get a zune.  But it is huge! Very large design.  And it is no more compatible than iPod!!!  It will not work with any software other than zune.  No Windows Media Player, Musicmatch Jukebox, Walmart downloads, or anything else.  The ipod is much cooler looking, and is much smaller.  The zune's colors are boring compared to iPod's.  If you are trying to decide between two incompatible mp3 players - choose iPod!!!

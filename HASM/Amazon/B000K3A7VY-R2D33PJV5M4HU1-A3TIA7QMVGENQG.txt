Title: Worked fine for 1 year
Content:
I bought this machine about 1 year ago.  I agree 100% with the other reviews that the carafe doesn't seem to "fit" right into the machine - and I have experienced a few overflows due to this issue.  Otherwise, the machine worked okay until yesterday.  I went to put the carafe into the machine and it wouldn't fit at all, couldn't even wiggle it in.  I did some looking and it turns out a piece of plastic in the brewing mechanism was broken.  This piece is critical to the brew process - I tried brewing without it and the coffee wouldn't come out and simply brewed into the machine.  I tried searching Mr. Coffee's website for a replacement but they don't sell one and neither does Amazon.  Guess that means I have to shell out $45 for a new machine, 1 year later.
In summary, the machine works fine for a while, but my next purchase will be on a machine that can last more than 12 months.

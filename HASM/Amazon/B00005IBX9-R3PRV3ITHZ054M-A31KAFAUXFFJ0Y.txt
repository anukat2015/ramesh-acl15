Title: Love and 7 years later
Content:
Well, after 7 great years of excellent coffee - she is on her last leg I feel. The maker, as soon as its finished brewing releases some water from the bottom of the maker - think of it as having a little accident. If you look at the bottom of the warmer it has some sort of venting system , it seems to be coming from there.  I'll wait another week or so but the water has been leaking a few weeks now.  I think I may get one with the coffee grinder built in.  I really like the size and function of this model. Best coffee maker ever - this has made coffee for me without issue for 7 years each and every day and them some!  I hate to get rid of it. This has been such a great buy!

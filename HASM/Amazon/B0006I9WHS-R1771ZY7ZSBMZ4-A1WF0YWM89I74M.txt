Title: Great little heater
Content:
I use this heater to heat our sun porch turing the spring and fall, as well as take the chill out of the basement for my morning workouts during the winter - it does a great job, although it is kinda small. If you need to warm up a room-sized area (I'd say up to 16 x 16), this is a wonderful, reasonably priced unit.

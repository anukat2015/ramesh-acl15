Title: It does what it should and very well
Content:
FINALLY, A WHITE COFFEE MAKER for the 90% of kitchens with white appliances that does everything well.  The only thing to even think about is that the interior lid stays moist because it makes such a great seal when working. You get: Hot coffee, brewed completely, minimum shrinkage of liquid from fill to finish, a LARGE fill port, a pot that doesn't drip...really, an easily removed cone that sits tightly, an outside fill gage you can read, and a positive auto off and on. Even the control knob and buttons have a positive feel. The only difference between this model 1100 and the upgrade? 1200 is the ability to control the temp on the hotplate. If that is worth $100+ to you, go for it. This one just makes hot coffee ready to drink as soon as there is enough to sneak a cup early, and then keeps it hot for 2 hours without burn. I read the reviews of others and have decided the complainers are professional whiners. I wonder who ties their shoes for them. IT IS A COFFEE MAKER THAT MAKES GREAT COFFEE at a price that is a steal--HELLO?

Title: Buyers Beware!
Content:
We have had coffee makers by Krups for years, but this in the "poorest" model they have ever produced.  Luckily this morning (Saturday) I got up earlier than usual and found the pot running dry.  We don't set up to run automatically on the weekends.  This is a real fire hazard.  The problem stems from controls that are very hard to see and understand, especially for older people.  The run function and the timer are on independant controls, and you must set both off instead of just one like the older models.  The contributing factor is it not having an always lit LED display.  It only comes on for a couple of minutes and then dims.  Thus you can never see what functions are running.  We also have a small puddle on the counter in the mornings where we have filled the reservoir the night before.  I'm sorry I ever bought this thing and I'm done with Krups.  Now I'm off to look for a replacement with a different brand.  Hope this helps some of you make your decision.
Sincerely,
A very unhappy Krups coffee maker owner!

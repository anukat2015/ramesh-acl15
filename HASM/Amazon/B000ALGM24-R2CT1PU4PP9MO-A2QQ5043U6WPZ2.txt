Title: WONDERFUL THERMOSTAT
Content:
I purchased this inexpensive thermostat because it thought my old Lux (uber-expensive) thermostat was not working. Turns out it was the furnace not the thermostat. None-the-less I have not put the old thermostat back on and have sold it on Craislist. 
This is the best thermostat I have come across. I did A LOT of research most of last fall and winter of 2008/2009 and most of the fall (and the beginning part of the winter) of 2009. I read a lot of reviews, I went to a lot of websites. I talked to my dad (a facility manager for a $20mil building, now a project manager for a company doing building worth over $100mil). In all the reviews I was skeptical of this unit because of the price (small) and the brand name (hunter). 
The price is small, it's no where near where the price of other brands. For the most part when it comes to things like this: you get what you pay for. Something with a cheap and disposable price is usually cheap and disposable. 
My other concern was the name: Hunter. Normally, not a company I associate with heating and air. Yes they make fans and yes some of their fans now have a heating element, but I don't think of thermostats when I think of Hunter. 
I decided to take a chance, but if I didn't like it I wanted to be able to return it so I bought locally (only $39). 
I HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT IMPRESSED. I love this unit. It's truly wonderful. I can't say enough about how much I like it. 
PROS:
-PRICE. This is very easy on the wallet
-Installation....VERY EASY TO INSTALL. 
-Light. You have to push the button to have the light on even at night. My old Lux automatically came on at night, nice but disturbing to others if I was changing it late at night. Also, this one does not make a loud humming noise when the light is on. 
-Battery cover is on the front, you do not have to take the unit apart to replace the battery (which shoudl last for about a year)
-HOME TODAY button. This button, when pushed, will bypass the programming and tell the unit to go to the warmest or coolest (depending on the season)setting for the day. For instance, being that I am lost my job and am home during the day (it's winter here). When I push the button it jumps to 68 degrees (our warmest setting)and will stay there until I hit clear. 
-pre-programmed schedule. Most units will come with a pre-programmed schedule. I like the settings on this one best.
-Recovery. If you have this programmed (if you want it off there is a switch on the unit, it comes pre-programmed in the "on" position) it will have the temp you want at the time you want. Usually, a thermostat would begin changing the temp at the set time. Recovery will tell the furnace to began changing the temp 30minutes before the programmed time. 
-Easy. The Lux I replaced was not very intuitive to use. This one is really easy and simple.
CONS:
-AUTO PROGRAM button. I like the auto program settings, but the button is right next to the CLEAR/HOLD button. It's way to easy to push the AUTO PROGRAM button and change all the changes you have made. It would be nice if Hunter made AUTO PROGRAM a two button feature so one would have to hit two buttons at the same time to change to AUTO PROGRAM settings. 
-nothing else. 
I can't say enough about this unit. It's the best out there for the price and the features. Someone mentioned something about the temperature reading being inaccurate. Well, I have noticed there can be a 1-2degree difference between the set temp and the temp the thermostat tells the furnace to stop (the final temp). I don't find this annoying. It's not a big deal because if the tempt is 1-2 degrees lower (in the winter and higher in the summer) the unit will kick on. This person also complained about different temps in the house....are you kidding me? The unit will have a different temp on the wall and off the wall...all will. If they don't the device is compensating for being on the wall. Temps near the wall will be different from temps in the center of the hall not to mention room-to-room. Don't let that review dissuade you. This is a good until.
Sorry for the long review.

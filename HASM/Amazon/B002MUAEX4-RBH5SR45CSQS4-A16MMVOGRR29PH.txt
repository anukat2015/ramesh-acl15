Title: Best point and shoot ever
Content:
As a point and shoot, this is the best I've seen. I don't have experience with the EP-1, which I understand is similar - but this is definitely the point and shoot to have to make a little better images that are normally possible.
I was shooting with the Leica R8 with its digital back, and its pretty bulky. This is much more portable. I got the adapter for the R lens as well, since its not looking good for Leica to come out with an R10. Using the R lenses is cumbersome, but works and if you have the patience, the results are... well, ok. You lose a lot on the conversion (2x, I believe), so my 180 becomes a 360...
This is not a Leica. The image quality is quite good, but at low light still leaves a lot to be desired. The video is awesome. Its so great to, with a point and shoot camera, just push a single button and its on, you are shooting HD video. The compression scheme is a problem, though. So far I was only able to use it with the software that came with the camera, which is horrible. I want to marry the videos to sound I capture with Cubase, and haven't been able to do that quite yet.
All and all, again, for point and shoot pics, this is the best. For high quality high def pics, not so, even with great lenses (woouldn't it be nice if Panasonic could do a full frame camera using the same format?). And for HD video, this is also pretty good, although it does not have the stabilizer.

Title: Quit working after 3 months
Content:
Today I crawled to the kitchen and and hit the on button twice and dragged myself to the kitchen table to await a wonderful cup of coffee.  I'm still waiting!  Nothing happened.  All the lights that normally come on came on, but no brewing.  The decalsify token was flashing, so I thought well maybe I'd better do that and see if it will brew-as though it were holding a cup of coffee as ransom until it was cleaned. I filled the water holder with 10 cups of fresh water and 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, took out the wasted coffee filter, saved the precious grounds and pushed the on button twice.  Nothing.  
Thank God I saved my old West Bend.  
The replacement filter cost $15.95 on the Delonghi site, I didn't bother to see how much the shipping would be.  
Apparently it was just a fluke that it stopped working just as the decalsify light came on.  
I'm very dissappointed in this machine.  And the carafe has been a source of counter top messes since day one.  It's very difficult to pour a cup without spilling it.  
My advise, find something else to invest in, like bonds or mutual funds.

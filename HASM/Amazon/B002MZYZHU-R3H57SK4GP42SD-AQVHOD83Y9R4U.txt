Content:
I was given a Keurig platinum coffee maker in June 2009 for Fathers' day.  Since that time, Keurig has replaced under warranty four of these units.  The fifth unit received in February 2010 was the Breville - given as an upgrade as my frustration increased.  Out of the box it primed fine, then on the first cup it locked up and shut off.  There are significant problems with the pump system.  This has been consistent on all of the Keurig makers I have received.  They engineers don't seem to know what causes this and they clearly don't have the solution.  It appears that the "guts" to the Breville machine are the same as that utilized in the Keurig's.  I would stay as far away from these machines as possible.

Title: Worth every dollar.
Content:
I won't drivel on about details. The short of this review is that somewhere between professional and consumer, this is the most bang I could imagine for the buck. I did a lot of research and decided that the next logical step would be to just wait for the 5D MarkII if you actually NEED a better camera than this. Except for the stock lens, which is probably fine for a new shooter to learn and play, I recommend first adding the 28-135 IS USM, used on Craigs List or EBay. That's the lens that came stock with several full frame bodies, and can be had for under $250 in excellent condition. It's a great range extender and infinitely better for shooting people than the stock lens. (100MM is a very good focal length for "people" pictures).
You will also find that adding the 430EX or EXII flash with a Sto-Fen makes a huge difference, and that if you are on a very slim budget, the Gary Fong Puffer makes the on board flash much less harsh.
So for under $1200 (I bought a lot more gear than that so I can make this recommendation with some breadth of experience), the camera, two lenses, and maybe the added flash makes a GREAT casual photography setup. Don't forget to buy a couple extra batteries and a LARGE (8GB+) memory card.

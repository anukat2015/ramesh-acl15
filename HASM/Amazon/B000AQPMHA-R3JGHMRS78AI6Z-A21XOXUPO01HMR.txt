Title: Happy Coffee Drinker
Content:
This machine is so great.  Super easy to use and the coffee always tastes great.  Coffee comes out nice and hot.  When you first turn it on, it only takes seconds to heat the water for use.  It holds a lot more water in the reserve tank than most coffee makers too.  It was well worth the $100 bucks!!!

Title: lowered gas bill
Content:
My parents have a friend that sells Iheaters, so they got two of them. While they were out of the country I borrowed them. We have a tri-level home with gas water heat. We are currently on the budget plan paying 180.00/month and it is going up to 190/month.  We just got a gas bill and an electric bill right before we set the heaters up. Our electric was 109.00 and our gas bill had we not been on the budget would have been 523.00 We put one heater in the kitchen because it is always cold, the thermostat for the heater is upstairs and set at 68 degrees, this kitchen is 64 degrees. We also set the other heater in the basement were we have a family area set up, this is 4 steps down from the family room that is also used alot. We did also have to get a couple of oil filled radiators for two of the bedrooms that are over the garage and are always very cold. We were finally warm in the bedrooms and kitchen. Needing to use a heater in the basement since the heater wasn't calling for heat.
We got the next months bills. Out electric did go up to 185.00 but I was leaving the iheaters on all night later discovering the built in timers. I them started tuning them on at night and setting them to come on in the morning. I work from home so I kept the one on in the basement all day. We started turning the oil filled radiators off in the morning too. Our gas bill, well..... if we had not been on the budget our bill would have been 221.00 A net savings of 215.00!!
We did have to give my parents the heaters back when they got back ( they have noticed a 100.00 reduction in their electric bill since being back)
We are picking up our two iheaters from their friend today and then we are going to go off the budget and put the savings away!!

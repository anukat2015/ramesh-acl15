Title: Don't expect support if it dies.
Content:
I really loved my 4gb player when it worked. One day it just died . . . wouldn't charge, sync with computer or turn on, nothing. Left there messages with customer support online and three weeks later I have received no reply. Even if you call within the standard one year warranty period there is customer support by within warrant period without having to pay a fee.
If this is fixed for me I will change this review . . . until then I will never buy a Creative product again.

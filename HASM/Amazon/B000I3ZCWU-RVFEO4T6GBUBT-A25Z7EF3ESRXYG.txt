Title: Amazing Camera!
Content:
After a little more than a month reading reviews I finally decided to go for this camera (Canon Rebel XTi). And I think I made the right choice. This camera has not disappointed me. Every picture I take comes out with outstanding quality. It's just amazing. 
Some people complain about the fact that Canon got rid of the small lcd screen. I've used the previous model (Rebel XT) and not having the little lcd screen doesn't bother me at all. All the information needed is displayed on the big lcd and it's great.
One more thing, this camera performs great under low light conditions. Check some of the images that I uploaded here.
Okay! In conclusion, this is an awesome camera, and although some might find it not so comfortable, I totally recommend it.

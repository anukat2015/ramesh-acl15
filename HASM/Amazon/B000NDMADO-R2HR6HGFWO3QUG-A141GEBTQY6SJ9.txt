Title: Wrong Wand
Content:
We had high expectations for this vacuum, and it may be a great vacuum for carpeted areas, but since our home is all hardwood flooring, it doesn't satisfy our needs.  We like the bagless canister and sturdy polycarbonate construction, but the expandible wand is over-engineered for hard flooring, too bulky and ineffective, with the hard floor attachment installed.  Our (Fein) shop-vac consistently outperforms it in its ability to pick up all forms of debris.  The wand is so bulky it's near impossible to raise it above eye level for cleaning various trim pieces and windowsills, et. al.  I see that Dyson has introduced an "All Floors" bagless canister, but for $750!?  There's really nothing wrong with this little machine, if we could get a different, less bulky wand that works on hard flooring...

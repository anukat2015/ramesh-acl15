Title: A Great Camera!
Content:
We purchased this camera for Christmas and it instantly took over as the camera of choice for group family photos.  We love it.  You can't use the camera right out of the box, though, as it does not come with a CF card (compact flash card).  A CF card is required for image storage and they aren't very available on Christmas day.  Add about $[...] to the total price for a 1GB CF card.
The camera does it all -- fully automatic, fully manual, bracketing, macro, etc, etc, etc.  The packaged software does some really interesting things with RAW images.  If you use the RAW image medium, you can alter the image per different camera settings after you download them to your computer.  It is a great way to see exactly what all those settings mean.
It does not do movies, but this is a still camera -- and it does stills very well.

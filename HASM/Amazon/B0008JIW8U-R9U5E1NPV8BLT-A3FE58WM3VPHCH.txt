Title: Best College Pot
Content:
I purchased this coffee pot from some local store when I first came down to my new city of Columbia for school. As my first coffee pot I didn't really know what to expect so I put my grounds in, plugged it in and enjoyed a first delicious cup. It is small, it fits well on a desk and despite what many will tell you makes the best cup of coffee not just for the value, but among many other more expensive options as well. I didn't realize this until someone broke my carafe and I had to borrow another coffee maker for a while. Don't be fooled by the price tag, price does not dictate quality. Either way if you want a great cup of coffee for a nice price, need the space, and like me think that 4 cup coffee makers are quaint then look no further.

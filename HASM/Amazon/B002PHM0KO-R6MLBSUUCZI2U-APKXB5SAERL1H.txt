Title: Great Computer.
Content:
Almost everything about this laptop is great. I love the keyboard with a little separation between the keys. The touch pad is nice because it has a little texture. It handles all video on the internet beautifully. The only thing that I don't care for is the shiny screen. It captures all light around you and reflects everything on the screen. It would be nice if it were like most screens and didn't reflect. However, it wasn't a big enough deal to think about returning it and other than that it's a perfect laptop.

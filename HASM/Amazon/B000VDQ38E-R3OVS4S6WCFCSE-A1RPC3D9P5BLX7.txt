Title: Worse Vacuum I ever bought-do not buy to use on bare floors or if you have dust allegies.
Content:
After 30 years of very hairy pets, even the cheapest vacuum from the Goodwill store did better, we have hard-wood floors and a large area rug. It cleans the area rug terribly and even though it says it is is friendly to hardwood floors on the box, it does not turn off the beater bar which results in the particles flying about, making the mess worse. It reminds me of an old 60's era Kirby trying to lug the thing upstairs. Also I have an allergy problem, so the idea of a side allergen filter was attractive, however in emptying the collection cup, which has to be done fairly often, a person end up touching and breathing the dust and having it end the air because you have to unclog the upper part. I can't wait until it dies so I can get a decent vacuum. If you have allergies, have someone else in your family take it outside to empty the canister.

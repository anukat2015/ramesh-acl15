Title: This heater is dangerious
Content:
I bought this heater in November 2007 I used it all last winter and was using it in my livingroom recently and sitting with my back to it on my computer and I smelled an odor like something was burning it was that Soleous heater it was smoking and almost caught on fire but blew the electric breaker(thank goodness) it could have caught my apartment on fire! I will never buy a radiant heater again!!!

Title: good Laptop with Win 7 Pro
Content:
I've bought this Laptop because it's the best option with Win 7 Pro. It has the best price - value i've seen in laptops with similar configurations.
Runs fast and smooth. I'm now in the process of adpatation to Win 7 from Win XP, and i still use mi old ZV6100 with XP, because 10 years with XP is not easy to forget. 
The transition of software to Win 7 is not too difficult, but there are a lot of programs that don't have version for x64 yet. The compatibility options like de Virtual Win XP, and the compatibility options y the contextual menus seem to be a good solution until the software migrates, or even better, gets 7 x64 compatible too. 
The design of this laptop is nice, the only CON it has is it's shiny finish. It's a dust and fingerprints magnet.
The sound quality is good but not more than that. 
I could recommend this laptop to everyone who wants good quality and Win 7 Pro. Sony Vaio would be nicer, but is too expensive.
Please excuse my poor english....
Merry X- Mas!

Title: works great!
Content:
i bought one of these a couple of years ago.  it was inexpensive and i liked the way it looked.  it worked great!  i totally mistreated it and yet it lasted until finally the clear plastic top piece started to break off where it attaches to the lid.  after a few more time throught the dishwasher it finally broke off all the way.  but i'm back to buy another one.  it made great coffee, was easy to use and was easy to clean.  great for the price!

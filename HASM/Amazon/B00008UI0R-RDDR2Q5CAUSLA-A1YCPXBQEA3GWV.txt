Title: Works well....when it works.
Content:
I am surprised to see all the 5-star reviews of this vacuum. I can only assume that they were written soon after purchase, because I have owned this vacuum for over 2 years and am ready to chuck it out the window. I have had numerous problems with it: sometimes I think it's possessed because it turns off in the middle of cleaning, or it WON'T turn off when I press the off button, or sometimes everything shuts down but the spinning brush. The cord that gives power to the carpet brush won't stay connected (I have to hold it in while vacuuming), it tips over when I drag it behind me, and the final straw is that I can't detach the carpet head from the wand so the hard floor and other tools are essentially worthless to me now. I know this was rated high on consumer reports (I know why--it really does a good job when it's not broken!) but so did the Electrolux Oxygen and it got terrible reviews on this site. And the Dyson rated low on CR and reviews. I don't know what to buy next! All I know is you would think in this day and age SOMEONE could make a decent vacuum cleaner that won't end up in the landfill in a couple years.

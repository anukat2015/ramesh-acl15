Title: It's a coffee machine and it makes coffee
Content:
I bought this to replace the same model which died after around 5 years of use. I give it 4 stars because I think it should have lasted longer given that it was not used every day. I chose this because I thought if the carafe broke I would have a spare seeing as they cost almost as much as a new machine. The feature I like is the fact that the hot water syphon hinges out the way with the lid. Also the lid stays up on it's own which is helpful. The carafe handle seems quite sturdy.

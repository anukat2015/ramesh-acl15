Title: High Quality Vacuum
Content:
I read a lot of reviews from other folks who had purchased Miele machines. Coming from a Hoover bagless with powerhead, I was worried about the extra cost of the Miele, the bags and the lack of powerhead. However, most of my vacuuming is hardwood or tile and what little is carpeted is not a worry. People remarked about the quality of the Miele motor and they were not kidding. Its very powerful and VERY quiet. I need to open the vent on hardwood, otherwise the head will suction to the floor. Its very light, moves easily, the cord retractor is quality and I like the "park" feature. All in all, this Vac is an investment in quality. Shop with confidence.

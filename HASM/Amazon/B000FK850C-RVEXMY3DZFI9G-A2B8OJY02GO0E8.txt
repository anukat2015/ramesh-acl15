Title: stopped working after one year
Content:
The unit was great...until it stopped working for no reason after only one year. We bought it in late November 2008, and today, after only nighttime winter use in two seasons, it burnt a hole in our floor and the base of the unit and has now totally stopped working. Thank god it didn't catch the whole place on fire. Of course, the warranty just expired. I do NOT recommend purchasing this unit.

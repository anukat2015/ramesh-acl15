Title: Great for pet lovers!
Content:
I have been searching for a vacuum cleaner that can handle the pet hair generated by my three cats and long haired dog...and I've found it!  After having the Dirt Devil for about a month, I'm thrilled with the awesome "sucking" power of this machine...it cleans dust and hair off of some of the hardest things (ie. lamp shades, stereo speakers, furniture, sliding glass door/screen door tracks) and does the best job I've ever seen picking up cat litter! I'm tough on vacuums and litter has tended to be the downfall of previous (more expensive) vacuums I've owned.  The design of this machine doesn't allow it to become clogged up from litter.  The vacuum is also light and I like that it is MUCH MORE QUIET than previous vacuums (something I was looking for).  The "head" is narrow and flat and can fit under/between furniture I couldn't reach with my uprights...the retractable cord is also VERY handy. I'm impressed with how it cleans the several stairs in my house, and can imagine that it would be tough to drag the whole unit up a full flight of stairs. I would actually rate the Dirt Devil a little below a "5" for a couple of reasons, the filter/canister design could be a little easier to clean out...and storage of the unit is a little cumbersome, moreso than an upright. Oh, but it's so worth it! For the price and the sheer sucking-power alone, this is an excellent unit and I hope mine has a long life!

Title: Nice but Deceptive
Content:
I bought a black 30 gb Microsoft Zune a week before Christmas at a local Costco store. I enjoyed the device for 3 and a half months with no complaints at all. In early March I was charging my device and returned to find a crack in the LCD screen due to a mechanical flaw. Me along with many other dissappointed Zune owners discovered that while charging, the Zune's battery starts to overheat and and the battery expands putting pressure on the LCD screen. The screen then cracks under the pressure. I called the Zune tech support and their reply was, "We cannot fix the crack in the LCD screen because it is not under warranty. We do not know any retailers that can fix your device." In a nutshell they told me that there is nothing they can do about it, it is not under warranty, and that they don't know where you can take it to be fixed. Apparantly I am not the only one to call regarding this problem and I would not recommend the Zune to anyone. You should wait for the second generation Zune so Microsoft can fix their problems or better yet buy a Sandisk Sansa or an Apple iPod. I am extremely disappointed.

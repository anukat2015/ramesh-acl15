Title: The ZUNE is Awesome... music, pictures, videos,podcasts
Content:
I recieved the 8 gb ZUNE for my B-day. I am so tech challanged thats its scarry. However, I had no problems with the zune. You download the software. It scans your computer for music then you just click & drag to your zune. The pictures & videos are crisp & clear. The music sounds great. You can choose to play music at random or you can choose to play by the album, or the music by song title. I have about 20 pictures on mine, 5 videos, and about 25 albums and I haven't even uesd 3 GB jet. 
Also, It is small enough to fit in my bra when working out out gardening. (Hey, I usually don't have pockets). There is nothing I don't like about my zune. Just like and ipod, but cheaper. whats not to love.

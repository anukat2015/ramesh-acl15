Well a few years ago, I purchased an Aspire One 10.1" Netbook, and if you're big into netbooks, you'll know that this specific line of D150s had a fan problem. The fan is loud. However, I was very pleased with everything else (I am currently typing this review on it, and I use it at school every day). But enough about that, this is about the Aspire 5542-5206.
As far as I'm concerned, many people have had problems with Acer's customer service, and unfortunately, I'm pretty good with computers and have never needed any customer service. And, if you are pretty good with computers, you'll know that if it has the specs you want, you really can't go wrong. So, I have no opinion as far as customer service goes. This computer has all the specs I wanted, well within the budged I set for it. After much research on the internet (yeah, I call it "blind shopping"), I kept ending up back at this one. But on to the computer.
The computer comes with an AMD Turion 2.2 GHz processor, 4 GB memory (667 MHz), 320 GB HDD (I'm more of a SSD fan, myself), and ATI Radeon HD 4200 (which is the 785G Chipset) graphics. If you're a hardcore gamer (which I'm not), this may not be the computer for you. It runs games very smoothly at high quality, however if you want the absolute highest quality for the most modern games, I wouldn't settle for any less than 1 GB discrete VRAM. However, if you are a casual gamer like myself, this is perfect, especially for the price. I am quite the fan of AMD (nothing against Intel, it's just that AMD usually crams in a better graphics chip/card for the same price, if not less).
And since I'm probably running out of space here, let me conclude that this laptop is of very high quality (again, for the price), and clearly outperforms most other laptops in the same range. Acer really redeemed themselves this time.

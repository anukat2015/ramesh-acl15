Title: WOW! Holy grody floors Batman!
Content:
Bought it on clearance from Target.  Its geared towards cleaning cars which is something I don't bother with. Its apparently the same vacuum as the Dyson animal but with slightly different attachments. You can vacuum pretty much the same things with these attachments like nooks and crannies and other parts of an English muffin as well as furniture. 
  We have cats, a large dog, a man, teenagers and a rabbit. The hair and testosterone floats thick and wavy in this house. Luckily we also have mostly hardwood. I cleaned our large living room to include moving all the furniture and area rugs and the long hall. I filled the collection cup completely. De-lish. Well the wife should be pleased. Maybe I'll get some loving for being a good boy. Wish me luck.

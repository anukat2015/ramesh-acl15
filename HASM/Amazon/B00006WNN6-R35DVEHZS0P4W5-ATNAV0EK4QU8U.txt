Title: Quits as soon as room starts to warm up.
Content:
It would seem the safety switch in this is just a little too sensitive to heat. I know they say not for bathroom use, but we put it well away from where it could get water on it. It will shut off in 5 minutes or less just about the time restroom is starting to get warm enuf to hop in the shower. End up having to turn furnace up and heat the whole house, which is a waste of heat as we are both leaving within the half hour. The bathroom and bedroom are 5 feet apart, use a radiator type heater in the bedroom at night, which does very well to keep the chill out of the bedroom.

Title: Great heater for the price!
Content:
Living in MN our below gound family room can get pretty chilly.  We are very pleased at how well this heater warms the room and how quiet it is.  When the heater is on our family room becomes the warmest room in the house, allowing us to keep the centeral heat turned down lower than we did before we bought the space heater.  Worth the money.

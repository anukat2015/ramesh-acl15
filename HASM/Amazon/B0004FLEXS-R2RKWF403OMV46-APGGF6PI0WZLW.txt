Title: read ALL reviews before you order
Content:
This item had 3 stars and we ordered without reading all the reviews.  Also, it was recommended by Consumer Reports.  This coffee maker is a piece of junk.  It lived up to all the bad reviews.  Very thin glass pot and also it does not fit nicely under the spout like it should - you have to wiggle it sometimes.  We are going back to Mr.Coffee.  The seller took it back and Amazon treated us fairly on the shipping charges.

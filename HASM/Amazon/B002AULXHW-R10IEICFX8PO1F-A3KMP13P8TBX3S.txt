Title: Nice Computer
Content:
I bought this Acer 14 inch for it's battery life and ease of mobility for college.  I like it so far.  I did delete a bunch of trial ware and games because I don't need that.  I downloaded my copy of MS Office 2003 in place of the 60 day "free trial" of MS 2007.  It is fast for me.  I found out it doesn't have a modem for my dial up internet.  Yes, I live in a cave.  It does have wifi b/g and draft N.  I haven't tested the battery life just going by what others have already said.  I really won't push this computer much but for me an everyday student I think it's going to be fast.  I mainly will use it for taking notes, writing term papers and in between classes maybe getting on the internet at a hotspot.  One thing I don't like is the shiny black plastic of the keys.  It does show alot of fingerprints.  I guess I just like my old Toshiba keys better.  The keyboard is nice but I have large hands and it takes getting used to.  
In the box came a CD with driver updates.  Thanks for everyone who complained because it made my life alot easier since I couldn't immediately connect to the internet.  I would have given this computer 4 1/2 stars.  If it had a modem then it would deserve a full five stars.  It has everything a college student could ask for.  I hope it lasts at least three years.  By then hopefully I can afford a better computer.
I have used this computer for a week now and it has exceeded my expectations.  I understand now that this class of notebooks doesn't come with a modem because it's in the ultra portable class and that would defeat the purpose of having the modem installed.  I love it so far.

Title: Dyson DC21
Content:
Have had this vacuum about 2 weeks.  I like everything about it, great suction.  Seems to be very well made.  The one thing I would recommend is a longer power cord.  The power heads brush roll really lifts the carpet, may be too stiff and powerful for delicate carpets.  Can be compacted easily for storage.  Love the idea of not paying for bags anymore.

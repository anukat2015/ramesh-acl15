Title: Convient coffee maker and easy to use
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker after the emotional stress of dumping money down the drain too many times. The mess caused by forgetting to shut down coffee maker and having to clean burned carafe was incentive too. The machine has three buttons corresponding to different quantities of coffee. The coffee maker poured a 10 oz cup of coffee at 176F at largest setting. The machine is also useful for brewing hot water when required for cooking. For my palette, the coffee that is brewed tastes pretty good - especially considering it costs only $.86 for cup of coffee. This cost is considerably less than donating your hard-earned cash to Starbuck's shareholders. The cost can be decreased if you decide to "Costco" and purchase in bulk.
There are few user interface issues that must be noted. First, the machine cannot be simply placed underneath counter because the K-Cup lever hits the top of cupboard. When fully extended, the height is 17.5 inches. Second, the clock does not have a battery backup. The clock is useful for setting the period where machine should stay on and keep water hot (i.e., save money on electricity). Unfortunately, power outages and digital clocks are not compatible.

Title: A solid laptop with a small price tag
Content:
Over the course of my college years, I have access to a few laptops, including this lenovo G550. It has very solid construction quality and runs very fast for normal use (e.g. office and web). It's quiet, looks cool, and has a nice screen. I would recommend this to any one who wants a solid laptop without paying an arm and a leg.

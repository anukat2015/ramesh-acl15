Title: Black and Decker MESS MAKER
Content:
Save your money, time, and frustration.  Brand new this coffee maker is the worst one I've bought, and I'm so darn dissapointed my next one will be anything other than B&D.
Coffee isnt hot enough, and worst of all,  EVERY TIME YOU POUR,  it spills and drips.   You cant fill the tank using the carafe unless you want to wipe up water.  You cant fill your coffee cup with brewed coffee unless you want to wipe up the mess.
You would think that SOMEONE would try to pour from it before sending it into production but the carafe is the worst thing ever.

Title: Not for "oldsters"
Content:
This is my first mp3 player; it was a Christmas gift.  I am a part of that generation that expects manufacturers to provide instructions with products.  There was a booklet which the manufacturer called a manual, but the typos in the text didn't inspire a lot of confidence. While there were instructions for downloading music.  There was no information on how to use the other features. The "manual" said that help is only a phone call away, but of course the line is always busy.  I resent having had to spend time trying to figure out how the various apps work.  I would not recommend this brand to anybody.

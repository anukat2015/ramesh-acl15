Title: warmer than smaller Lasko using same wattage
Content:
Just got this tower heater today.  Observations so far:
-I deducted a star because it's a bit wobbly on carpet and on ceramic tile.  It's probably too heavy to tip easily, but it bears mentioning.  It's quite tall.  The space saving of a tower heater is perfect for my small motorhome, so I live with wobble.  No idea how this could be corrected without creating unwanted bigger footprint or weight.  
-I put it in a different place during the day, so the carry handle is convenient.
-It seems to be more powerful than my smaller Lasko tower heater, even though the watt settings are the same as the smaller heater.  Maybe it's more efficient.    
-The front definitely needs to be located a yard from any flammables, because the heat coming out is too hot to hold my hand two feet in front of it, even on low, for more than a few seconds.  
-The remote is simple to use.  The remote's buttons could be more differentiated for easier operation in the dark.  
-The controls on the heater itself are cheesy looking, and the engraved silver-on-silver labels are difficult to read in shadow.  
-I would like to have the thermostat work on the low setting.  In both my Lasko towers the thermostat works only on high.  Freeze or fry.
-The heat and blower can't be felt at the bottom foot or so.  I can put it almost anywhere, and it won't bother the cat on the floor.  The downside is that the lowest part of the room isn't heated.
-There's a clip on the back that holds the remote.  It would be great for Lasko to include a second one of those cutom fitted clips to be able to attach to a wall to hang the remote near where it will actually be used.
I phoned Lasko to get some help comparing the various heaters, of which they list 19 in the tower design alone.  Basically I was told I had to figure it out myself from whatever product descriptions they provided online.  Fortunately Home Depot online makes an effort to help compare multiple products; although, it's limited to what they offer, of course.  Both HD and Walmart carry this model, but neither had it in stock.  Prices were the about the same, and I saved tax and shipping with my Prime membership by purchasing through Amazon.

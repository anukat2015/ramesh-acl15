Title: Windows user makes the jump!
Content:
I have been looking at switching to a Mac for my personal laptop for several years but the cost always delayed my decision.  Well I finally hit the order button on the 15.4" MacBook Pro and can't be happier.  The quality of the build is outstanding and I love how smooth the OS and applications run.  It actually feels like a single product which I know is the point of a Mac but it is so refreshing.  I've spent a week getting to know the OS and built in apps and have found it easy to learn.  It is funny that I have to learn to do things the natural way (such as the finger controls on the touch pad).
Figuring out how to transition over from Quicken on my PC is still a challenge.  I've been looking at iBank and may give it a shot.  I just ordered iWork so I can migrate off Excel/Word/PowerPoint.
Pros: 
1) top of the line construction
2) stable OS
3) ease of use working with pictures
4) smooth integration with my camera, printer and Internet apps
Cons: 
1) cost is a bit high (but snagged a good deal on Amazon)
2) while the shell is nice and sleek, the edge is a bit sharp and can rub on your wrist if you are at a bad angle
Overall I am VERY HAPPY

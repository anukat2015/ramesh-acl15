Title: What a Bissell-tastic bummer
Content:
I have never been so disappointed in a Bissell. I love my carpet shampoo Bissell and I trusted the brand and the reviews I saw on this machine. It's a dust cyclone creater. If it's a bright sunny day, you can see the dust shooting up in the air. Even after the first time I used it, the exterior of the unit was brown from the dust. Shouldn't that dust be INSIDE the unit? I have used this vacuum a total of three times. I hate vacuuming now because of this contraption. I have made sure the bucket is on secure, but the dust cloud continues to happen. I tried cleaning the filters and keeping the bucket emptied, still a mess. If you have a big dog that puts a lot of dust in your home, rethink this purchase. I bought it because our dog does put a lot of hair on the carpet and I hoped it would solve my dust and doggie hair world. It does pick up the hair, but it can barely pick up a piece of lint or minute piece of paper. 
What's the point if I can't suck the tiny pieces of fuzz up or my daughter's minute paper cuttings? The suction is unacceptable. To heck with picking up a bowling ball, I want to suck up a spider from half way across the room. I am a woman with simple requests. I so wished this bagless vacuum could have worked for me, but it causes me nothing but heartache to even pull it out of the closet. I wish I had kicked down for a Dyson or a bag vacuum again. Please don't give me a hard time for honesty, as I rarely write a poor review, but I do it to discourage those with dogs and high dust environments.

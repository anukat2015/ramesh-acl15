Title: I'd rather get a Toshiba
Content:
Bought this for my teenage son 6 months ago. Had trouble with audio in December. Called Acer to find out what to do and they told me I had to ship it back for repairs. I asked them if they could send box and they said shipping is not included in the one year warranty and that I would have to get it to them on my own. Asked them why shipping is not included and they didn't have an answer. Buy at your own risk. Customer Service is terrible as I had difficulty communicating with rep on the other line and who couldn't answer my questions clearly. The information above was gathered after two months of calling and getting hung up on. Terrible service. Computer is expensive enough that you'd think customer service is up to par but no go. Be aware when purchasing this item.

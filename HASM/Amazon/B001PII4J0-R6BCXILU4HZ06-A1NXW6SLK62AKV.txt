Title: Don't Buy it Now
Content:
This laptop is good but it isn't great, the pointing stick is really sensitive, and the keyboard is really easy to adjust to, but it is very easy to leave fingerprints on the cover; nonetheless, this is good machine.
The US version comes with the Intel Atom 1.33GHz, but the Japanese version as well as the ones in Hong Kong come with the option of choosing Intel Z520 1.33GHz, Z530 1.6GHz, and Z540 1.86GHz. Once again the US isn't getting the "right" stuff, for some reason US will also have this lag in presenting us the product we wanted. I also asked one of the sales representative, and he says there will be an upgraded version in US, but it's going to take awhile, so don't waste your money now and wait for the upgrades or you could choose to buy the Japanese version, which is available in many websites.

Title: Ahhh, warm feet!  Almost perfect... needs an on/off switch
Content:
I was always cold in my office.  Even with a space heater, I'd always be cold.  I realized it was that my feet and lower legs were cold because the cold air comes up from the cement slab through the thin carpet.  It would just make me cold to the core.
The heating pad is great.  The bad smell problem others reported when first turning theirs on wasn't evident with mine after more than the initial 15 minutes.
The only thing that I wish they had was an on/off switch or even a timer.  I need to unplug mine from the wall.  I've left it on overnight on several occasions.  It doesn't cause any issues... it just wastes energy.

Title: Disappointed
Content:
I brought this Black and Decker because I had previously owned two undercounter B & D and was very pleased with the operation, life span and of course the coffee making. Installation I thought would be easy but in my application I had several problems. The hole template was much bigger than my last B & D. This required getting another board to attach to the cabnet and so on. I was satified with the looks once I completed the install.  Now the real troubles.  This unit is not designed for humans. The flat water reservoir when full  is hard to manage without spillage from the sink to it's slot in the unit. The filter basket has a nub of a handle which can't in itself be used to remove the basket. One has to grab the basket on it's side to safely complete removal and dumping of the used grounds. Worst of all is the carafe.  Looks good but ergonomics are not for humans. The handle is too far away from the center of gravity making it feel very heavy. The carafe is avertised as a dripless pourer.  This carafe is a sure dripper. I have tried many ways to execute a drip free pour which I estimate was achieved about one percent of the time. And lastly the finished coffee product is not hot enough which means the flavors of the grounds have not been fully realized.

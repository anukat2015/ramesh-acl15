Title: .dll file missing!
Content:
I bought this Canon because I've had a small one for years and love the ZoomBrowser software that comes with it. AND it took great photos. This is a great camera, and as a nearly total novice, it took me awhile to figure out how to use it, but now I'm satisfied with the quality. However, I installed the software with the discs provided,excitedly connected the camera to my computer to download and found that the software did not include a required .dll file. I have to say I was pretty proud of mysself that I went online, found the file on a free download site and got it all going. BUT WHY DID I HAVE TO DO THIS???  Also, I wish the website had a way to inform a buyer off additional items I would need to operate the camera. I did not have the correct memory card and living out in the middle of nowhere, I spent another week ordering and waiting for the memory card to arrive. OH, well - live and learn!

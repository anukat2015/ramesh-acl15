Title: disappointed
Content:
Fan is a bit noisy, not recommended for sleeping in same room, quality is poor (fan rattles and top controls shake around a bit -- I'm returning it), 750 watt low heat seems to be enough so that's ok, thermostat works well, fan does cycle off with the thermostat (unlike their DVTH model), fan just too loud -- should be a low speed but sounds more like medium.

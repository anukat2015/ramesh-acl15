Title: Not worth the money.
Content:
The middle daisy never did work from day one.  Aftera couple of weeks  the second daisy failed to work.  The protector cage 4fell off after tranporting it one time.  For the money it was not worth it.  The single daisy fixtue actually had more positive aspects.  Easy to use and it worked well. I needed this for the people at work.  It appeared to work satisfactoly at furst but the middle daisy never would light up. And now the the second daisy does not function either.   There are no adjustment to make. So nopw I have purchased a thtee daisy  haeaater and only one works.   would not recomment to purchase.

Title: My $70 space heater works better!!
Content:
My oh My! I guess this is what I get for watching informercials, right? My friend had a problem with his home heating system and my dad bought an edenpure a couple of years ago and it did a great job, so we thought it would be a good solution to the problem for the winter. NOT!! Bought this unit for $397, and right out of the box you have to practically sit in front of the heater in order to get any warmth! So, you can enjoy your day in warmth if you do nothing else but sit in front of the heater. He was lucky if the temperature had risen 1 degree at the end of the day, running at full power, with no drafts in the room and the room being small. My $70 heater did a better job. Jeez.

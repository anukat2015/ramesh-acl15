Title: Would be more effective in a room with low ceilings
Content:
I knew when I bought this (based off other customer reviews), that this product probably would not be very effective in our living room that has 20 ft ceilings.  BUT, it is our coldest room in the house, so I went for it anyway.  It did help a bit, but I would say the cost of electricity to run it offset any savings we got on our gas bill.  I think it would be very effective in a small room with lower ceilings (e.g. a bedroom or den).

Title: Good for small rooms
Content:
I bought this to heat my basement (about 300 square feet).  After a few hours, there would be a noticeable difference, but it just took a long time.  I'm keeping it for our small spare bedroom, and bought a lasko convection heater for the basement. Works much better for a larger space.

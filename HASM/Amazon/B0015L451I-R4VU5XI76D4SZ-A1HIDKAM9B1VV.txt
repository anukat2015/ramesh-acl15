Title: SanDisk Sansa Good Buy
Content:
this is my first MP3 player so I really have nothing to compare it to.  It works great, is comfortable to wear during my runs and workouts.  The only thing I don't like is the formatting of music from the computer to the device.  The software could be better with a drag and drop feature.  Its confusing and even a chore for my husband who has an Ipod and uses Itunes.  Rhapsody is fine, but the program to format it stinks.  I do like that I didn't get sucked in to spending more for an IPod.  The Sansa has proven to be a great device.

Title: This Device Does It All!
Content:
Very cool device that does a lot for the money.  The color monitor is very sharp, albiet small.  It is very easy to drag and drop files to the device.  My only complaint is that the battery life is not near the 8 hours touted in the specifications.  If you use it at work like I do invest in a second DC/AC adapter.

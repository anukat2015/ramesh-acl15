Title: Inconsistent Results
Content:
I purchased this item wanting a coffee maker that would make coffee hot enough to go into my thermos so I can take it to work.  I followed the setup directions and tried to use it.  The coffee is inconsistent in flavor at best. I use Starbuck's ground coffee and it is fine in the Mr. Coffee I own, just not as hot as I would like. In the Bunn it is weak one time and too strong the next.  I notified the seller and they sent me a second with the same results.  It seems like the water goes through so fast it does not have time to extract the coffee flavor leaving it weak and tasteless. 
I will be sending it back.

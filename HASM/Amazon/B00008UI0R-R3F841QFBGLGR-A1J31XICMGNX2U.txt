Title: Pretty much everything I wanted
Content:
I read all the other reviews and pretty much agree. The dirt cup itself could be much bigger, as I do have to empty it at least once each time I use it, but the power and options are good. The ability to turn the power nozzle brush off, while maintaining suction is wonderful. It prevents dropped seeds (from my pet birds) or kitty litter from being kicked all over. However, I did later order a separate bristled floor brush that focuses the suction forward even more, and improves the system. Nice to have on my wood floors. The power hand nozzle is great on furniture. I do wish the power floor nozzle was ajustable in height, as it does bog down on the carpet in our bedroom, but that room doesn't get dirty very quickly, so it's not been a big issue. However it it fine on our living room carpet and there is minimal pile difference between the two, so I'm not sure why the vacuum performs so differently in those two areas. one lst thing, the adjustable lenght handle on the floor tool is fantastic. It's great for taller guys who normally have to stoop to vacuum.

Title: Powerful heater
Content:
I purchased two of these units in the fall. For their size they really put out the heat, but that can be a problem, because they don't have thermostats. So on just a slightly chilly day you can really end up with the space your warming too hot for ones liking. The timer feature is helpful, but doesn't replace a thermostat. After months of use, one of the heaters stopped working for me, but the other is still going as good as the day we purchased it. I think this heater is a fair value for a price of $29.99.

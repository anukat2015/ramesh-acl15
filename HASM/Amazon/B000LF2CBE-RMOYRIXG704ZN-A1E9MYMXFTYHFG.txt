Title: Great Heater At A Great Price
Content:
This heater compares favorably to the $300.00 Eden-pure and other similar heaters. I have 2 Eden-pures in the house, and bought the Lasko heater after researching heaters with similar features ie; squirrel cage fans, adjustable thermostats, and 1500 watt heating elements. The main diference is between the Eden-pure with it's infrared quartz heating elements and the Lasko and it's ceramic element. I was concerned that the ceramic might not be as economical to operate, but this turned out not to be the case. I bought the heater in Nov and the Lasko heats my insulated 12X 16 Ft. shop in southern Idaho to 70 even when its down to +10 degrees.

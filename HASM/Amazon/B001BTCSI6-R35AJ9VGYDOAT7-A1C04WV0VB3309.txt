Title: D700 ROCKS!
Content:
HAVING A D300, AND LOOKING FOR BETTER AF FOR BIRDING, AND BETTER LOW ISO CAPABILITY FOR SPORTS, I BOUGHT THE D700. I WAS ON THE FENCE, HAVING WANTED NIKON TO RELEASE A BETTER DX MODEL WITH BETTER LOW LIGHTING ISO AND AF, BUT GOT TIRED OF WAITING. BOUGHT D700, AND HAVNE'T LOOK BACK.
PICS OF D700 ARE AMAZING, WITH BETTER RESOLUTION, AND FASTER FOCUSING THAN D300, WHICH IS A GREAT CAMERA AS WELL. FPR BIRDING/SPORTS, WITH ADEQUATE LIGHT.
BUT, FOR SPORTS IN LOW LIGHT (FOOOTBALL AT NITE, ETC OR BIRDS IN FLIGHT,ETC) YOU CANNOT BEAT THE D700!!
AND FOR PORTRAITS, AND LOW LIGHTING EVENTS (CONCERTS, AND WIDE ANGLE PHOTOGRAPHY, LANDCAPES, SUNSETS), FULL FRAME IS FANTASTIC!!

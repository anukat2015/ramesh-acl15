Title: Overpriced, and then it died.
Content:
As a coffee lover, I decided to invest in a great maker.  I splurged on this before the price came down--paid about $125.  My first disappointment was that the machine made coffee no better than an inexpensive unit.  Looks great, for sure, but the coffee was no better.  But when, after two years, the machine died... that was too much indeed.  I've seen Brauns that last well over a decade.  I expected a lot more for my money and from my coffee beans.  Yes, some people have gotten lucky with this, but countless customers have been burned by this Cuisinart.  Do not buy it.

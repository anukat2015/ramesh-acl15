Title: Hp not too bad
Content:
This is a pretty nice computer, but the 60 day free trial of Norton didn't work the second day I had it. I would get rid of it and put in a new anti viral program, but unfortunately my computer  tells me not to or it will crash the system. Yeah for me. This one is nicer than my Dell though because after having my Dell for less than one year the mother board crashed and had to be replaced. Overall, I guess I will see what happens.

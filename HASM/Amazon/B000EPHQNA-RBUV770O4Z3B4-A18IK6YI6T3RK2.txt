Title: NEXT GEN. SHUFFLE
Content:
I had the previous shuffle and I loved it, it's so easy to use..itunes rules.  I hear people say, yeah but you cant scroll down and find a particular song, or it does not have enough gig strength, I say whatever, for me it's perfect..look i load all of the songs so they are all songs i want to listen to, as for the memory, well i dont want more that 150 songs on my ipod at once anyway, i replace my song list all of the time.  As for the new shuffle, it's fantastic, it's tiny and light and hooks on anywhere you need it, and i really like the chrome color, they only neg's are that you have to charge the shuffle on your computer, you cant set it in a charger and charge it from your home outlet..bummer..and the ear buds that come de riguer with the ipods are serviceable at best, but other that that, I highly recommend it, it's relatively inexpensive, easy to use and surprisingly durable.

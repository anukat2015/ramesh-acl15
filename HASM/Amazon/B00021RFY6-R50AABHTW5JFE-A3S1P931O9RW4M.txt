Title: cuisinart DGB_600BC over priced & over rated
Content:
We bought ours new from Younkers Dept. Store for $150.00, it will grind coffee and make coffee. Thats about the best you can say for this over rated and over priced coffee maker. The coffee is not hot enough when it is made and the insulated carafe does not keep it hot. We have to reheat the coffee on stove to boiling and pour it into the carafe, then it cools down within a couple of hours. If you do not watch very carefully you can overfill water reservoir which overfills the carafe and then it will run over ruining whatever it sits on. I would say any $15.00 brewer will do a better job.

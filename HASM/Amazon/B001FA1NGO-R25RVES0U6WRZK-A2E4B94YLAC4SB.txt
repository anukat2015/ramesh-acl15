Title: This product got great profesional reviews but missed some glareing problems
Content:
Good.  Firmware is pretty good with the accelerometer adding some nice features like shake shuffle and some games.  Almost as good as the 3rd generation
Bad.  The rounded screen makes for some horrible glare.  Battery life is not good.  Can only charge with the USB cable to computer which means at work when I run out of juice I am done for the day.  Itunes is very buggy on windows and annoyingly tries to make you update even though the first version of the update renders your Ipod unusable until you do some strange voodoo dance.  
Basically I loved my first generation Nano so much that I got a 3rd generation when i lost my first generation.  When I lost that one I was very close to getting another MP3 player due to the fact that the software was so damn buggy.  Inevitably I broke down and bought the 4th generation which was a mistake.  The surface area was roughly the same as the 3rd generation but the square sized seemed to fit better in my pocket.  One of the worse problems besides the Itunes software was the inability to use my old power charger.  I think that is pretty much a slap in the face by apple and for me a nail in the coffin for Apple products .  Once soccer moms start using something the coolness factor disappears.

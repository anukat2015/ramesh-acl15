Title: Does what it's meant to do, and well
Content:
I give this five stars not because it's "amazing" or "unbelievable," but because it has performed well, and reliably for over a year.  The filter is effective, durable, and easy to clean.  The suction is strong enough to pick up relatively large pieces of debris.  The brush and nozzle tools perform well and are easy to use.  Most importantly, the brush beater attachment is powered by its own motor, so it spins well, and doesn't diminish the suction.  It excels at small pickup jobs.  We also had a cleaning lady who used it every week to clean a 6x9 rug.  Using the powered beater, it picked up whatever was on the rug, including pet hair, without ever losing power or breaking (cleaning people can be hard on vacuums).  I don't think you could ask for more in a portable vacuum.  Noise level is average (not quiet, but also not excessively loud).  Only minor caveat: we left the charging station loose on the floor, and as such, the vacuum was difficult to smoothly remove from and insert in the station.  The plastic bit that held it in eventually broke.  It still stays on the station, but is now easier to take off and put back on - problem solved, sort of.  The tools also have a tendency to fall off their holders on the charging station.  I think it's really designed to be mounted on a wall.  Re battery life, we did the initial charge, and the vacuum always stays on the charger when not in use.  I haven't noticed any reduction in power or battery life, but it never gets used for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time.  As with any vacuum, it's necessary to occasionally cut or pull hair off of the beater brush.

Title: Absolutely awesome!
Content:
I have been an Olympus digital camera user since 1999 (an old Camedia C-900, 1.3 MP purchased in '99 that still works perfectly). I upgraded from an Evolt E-300 to the E-510 and what a difference. The image stabilization works great and the entire package is easy to use and take very nice pictures. The 2 lens kit pretty much handles any situation an amateur like myself would come across.

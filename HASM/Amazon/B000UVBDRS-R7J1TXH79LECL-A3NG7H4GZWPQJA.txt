Title: Cool mp3 player
Content:
This is my first mp3 player & I really like it. The device is light, handy & cool looking. It is very easy to operate & navigate. The software provided for syncing with a pc is not that great. When ripping songs from a cd, it does find the album information but doesn't copy the album art. With the brilliant screen of the mp3 player it is kind of sad that the album art is not copied. Of course, if windows media player is used to sync songs then the problem is solved. Copying itunes video to the mp3 player takes hell lot of time. Considering how cool the mp3 palyer is the bad pc sync software can be ignored.

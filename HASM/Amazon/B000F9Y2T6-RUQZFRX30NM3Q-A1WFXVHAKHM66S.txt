Title: more cons than pros in our house
Content:
Pros:
specifically for bare floors
is supposed to vacuum and heat mop
Cons:
Very small capacity (I have a 1400 sq ft home that is tile with area rugs and I empty this vacuum an average of three times if I do the entire home).
The Liquid spray option never has worked, so I cannot use the wet option at all. 
Filter gets filthy very often (mind you I have two preschool children and an enormous golden retriever).
Faulty design (my machine sends all the debris up into the filter and not into the canister- this is why the filter is always needing washing and I must empty multiple times to maintain suction).
This machine may still work well for some people out there, and I do use it from time to time just as a bare floor vacuum.  I may get it repaired so the mop function will work but for the cost I am thinking of just getting a more heavy duty bare floors vacuum and a swiffer wet jet- I know that that will work.  I was really looking forward to a vacuum and mop combo, but this model is not a good match for my household.  Maybe we just supply too much mess for this little machine.

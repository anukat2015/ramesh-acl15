Title: miele carina canister vacuum
Content:
Although spendy, this vacuum rocks!!!! I have a 3 year old boy, a great dane and my old man has a wood shop in the basement.  This vac picks up dried up mac & cheese, dog hair and saw dust.  I have MS and it's easy to maneuver and store.  The cord could be longer, but that hasn't been too much trouble.   I highly recommend  this vac, I hope to have it for years.

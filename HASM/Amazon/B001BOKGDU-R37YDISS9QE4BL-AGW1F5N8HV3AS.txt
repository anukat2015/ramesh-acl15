Title: No bells and whistles, just a good little coffee maker
Content:
This is an update for my original review shown below.  After having the pot several more months, I have noticed that the hot plate does get corroded from hot coffee dripping on it.  Also, one other problem, which has also been mentioned by other reviewers is that pouring out the coffee can get messy - it tends to drip and dribble unless you pour slowly and keep the lid raised while pouring.  However, considering how much use I get out of it (at least three pots of coffee or hot water a day), I'm still happy with it and my original rating of four stars stands.  If B & D can come up with a better, non-drip carafe and a hot plate that doesn't corrode, they'd earn five stars from me.  
The Black & Decker 5-cup coffeemaker is a good little basic pot for those times when you only need to make enough coffee for one or two people.  I generally use a 16 oz. mug for my coffee and with this pot I get almost two mugs full.  One of the other reviewers mentioned that the hot plate portion of their pot had corroded from the coffee dripping onto it.  I haven't had that problem but I've only had my pot for about three months.  There are no bells and whistles with this machine - no timers, automatic shutoff, etc.  It's just a good basic coffeemaker for people who don't want to make a big pot of coffee when all they want is a cup or two.

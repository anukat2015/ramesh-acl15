Title: Worst vacuum I've ever owned
Content:
I bought this vacuum two years ago for light housework and probably used it 40 or 50 times.  It burned out already and is not worth the cost to fix it. It is going in the trash, along with the $100 I spent on it, I'm afraid.  Terrible investment, never buy this product!

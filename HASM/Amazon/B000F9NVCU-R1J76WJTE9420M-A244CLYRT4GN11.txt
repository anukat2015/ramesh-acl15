Title: Decent Buy
Content:
I had bought this from a retailer back in June/Jly of 06. Cost me about 600 bucks total. Although it is a tiny bit outdated it's a good little buy even for the various things I use it for. For example: Artwork on photoshop, music, a few pc games, and plenty of internet.
Although it could use a better video card.

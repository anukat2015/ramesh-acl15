Title: Nice alternative to the SDC850
Content:
I'm one of the reviewers of the SDC 850 that had a leaky pot.  Thankfully, this one doesn't leak and indeed uses the same holes as the SDC 850-I even kept the screws I had to hacksaw for the SDC 850 and used them on this one.  Works well, doesn't leak.  Wish it had the stainless steel trim of course and also wish it were thermal like the SDC 850 because on my last two B&D ODC440B's the warmer plate rusted out in a few months.  If the warmer plate does not rust out this is indeed a viable alternative to the SDC 850.  Hopefully B&D reads these.

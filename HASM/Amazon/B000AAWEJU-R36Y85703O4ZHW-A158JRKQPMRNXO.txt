Title: Well-worth the extra cost!!!
Content:
"I just received and tested my new Miele office vac. Even this lowest-end Miele is FANTASTIC! It's as quiet as the one I have at home, it's similarly designed, easy to use, and works terrifically well. I am so pleased that I spent the extra money and got a really good vacuum."

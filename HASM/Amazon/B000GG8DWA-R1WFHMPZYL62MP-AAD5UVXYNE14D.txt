Title: Best space heater for the price and efficiency.
Content:
One of the unique features of this space heater is that it's power settings are 400W and 800W.  Most other space heaters are like 750W and 1500W, so this is about 50% less power.  With the heating bills these days, saving power adds up in saved $.  Even though it uses half the power, this thing really does heat up my room.  It's not a great heat up your whole house type of thing since heat rises and will leave the area, but in confined areas like my office, or my bathroom/bedroom, it works like a charm.
Even in the living room, if I put it near me it'll keep me warm, but it won't heat up the whole room since all the heat leaves and floats up stairs.  I only have to turn it on for like 15-20min in my office, and it gets REALLY warm in here that I just turn it off and it stays warm for hours.
I highly recommend getting one of these or more! ( I own 2 )

Title: Such a steal and a great little computer.
Content:
I got it at such a steal at Costco for they ended up giving me a $90.00 credit. What I like is the keyboard (much more tactile), the weight, quick downloads, the size 14" screen is perfect for me, it's energy efficient, the battery life (though I have not really seen how long it will run but at least 6 hours, the camera (I checked out HP and their software and it was terrible for there is more control here. Oh yes and this model has a 500 giga bite hard drive which is quite nice. Still learning what Windows 7 can do for I am no computer geek. 
The main drawback for me is the speakers they are small and tinny so if you really enjoy listening to music through the speakers or watch movies find another model or wear headphones. Otherwise, great laptop and loved the price.

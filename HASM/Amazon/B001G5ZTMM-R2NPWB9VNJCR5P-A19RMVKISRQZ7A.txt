Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
I purchased this Canon as a replacement to my 20D.  Buyer Beware and go with the Nikon!!  Nikon's are much more reliable for focusing and metering.  I find the focus system less accurate than my 20D and am completely disappointed with this product.  I wanted to stay in the Canon family as I have been a fan for years, but this product has completely changed my mind!  Yes the Mark II has the bells and whistles, but if your pictures are soft they are worthless!

Title: Nice little Vacuum
Content:
We got this little vacuum for our wedding over two years ago. We have used it a lot and have been very happy with its performance. We have used it to clean up dust and hair cut clipping to kitty litter and concrete pieces. Recently the battery won't hold much of a charge. I was looking into getting new batteries, but the batteries are half the price of the vacuum, plus I would have to solder them together. $15 for batteries and an hour of my time would make it cheaper to buy a newer, even more expensive one. (If you would like to replace the batteries in your, they are "sub c" cells 1.2 volt. Make sure to watch out for 1/2, 4/5, etc sizes, they aren't the same). In the long run we will probably end up buying this same one again.

Title: Canon body using Nikon lenses
Content:
I not going to start a Canon vs Nikon debate, I used Nikon for years and loved it!! Have some older Nikon lenses and wanted to get the D5000. My older lenses would not fit, so had to get the D90. Looked at the prices and did a ton of homework and was really impressed with the features on the t1i, and stellar reviews did not hurt either.I found an adapter, Fotodiox and much to my surprise all my older glass worked on the Canon!! The picture compared to Nikon is a little more on the red side and photos are little brighter, SQF too close to call. Not anything bad, just a little different. Kit lens 18-55 3.5-5.6 is pretty good, but when you figure for 700-725$ and the D-90 was 950-1000$ NO BRAINER! Also just adjust settings to your liking and you'll love this camera. The real kicker was the video, I really didn't want any video, but was pleasantly surprised. The 1080 at 24fps or 25fps was not a choppy as I read about, 720 at 30fps really nice!! very, very clear and looked great. Also want to praise Amazon, No Taxes!!! Was going to buy it at Sam's Club,got 125$ in gift cards for x-mas,same price but when they rang it up the tax was like 80-90$ more. I live in Ca. The 920.000 live view screen, Wow. looks great even in bright sunlight. Comes with good software and processing in DPP if you shoot raw, works great. High J-peg looks fine too. One thing,get a CLASS 6 sdhc card. If you don't then video will probably look bad and card will fill up fast.Overall, Really, Really happy with this camera and with the Nikon glass, Best of both worlds! Still use my older Nikon camera too.

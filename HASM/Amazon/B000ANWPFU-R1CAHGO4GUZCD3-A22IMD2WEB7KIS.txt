Content:
This heater worked really well for me until last night. Now the dial that turns on the heating mechanism is broken.  I purchased this in April, 2008 and the warranty has been expired for a long time.  I expect things like this to last a long time, since I do not like adding junk to landfills or paying another $55 for a heater. Hopefully someone from freecycle will want it and know how to fix it.  Next time I will buy a Delonghi because I have had one of those for years and it still works fine.

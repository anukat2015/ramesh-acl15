Title: heater blows
Content:
The unit worked well for while but developed the problems others report. I tried cleaning the dust out; adjusting settings; tried about everything; didn't help. The engineer (above) is right, one could by-pass controller. Tempting, but it is not worth it to short circuit safety shut off, even if you happen to be one of the suckers that owns one of these already. Please do not donate these. Someone who really needs heat and can't afford to take home a dud might buy it. Recycle metal or trash it if you can't return it. Or maybe you can sell yours to one of these people who say they like theirs. Lucky SOBs probably live in Hawaii.

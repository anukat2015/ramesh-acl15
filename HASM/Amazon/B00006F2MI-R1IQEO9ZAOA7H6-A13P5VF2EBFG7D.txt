Title: Too expensive to keep replacing
Content:
This is my second grind & brew to own and I love them while they work.  They make great coffee and I don't even mind the hassle involved in cleaning them.  What I do mind is that both machines have died due to the same problem ... they will not stay on.  No one should have to turn on the coffee maker 5 or more times just to get a half pot of coffee brewed.  The bottom line ... this machine is too expensive to replace every 2 years.

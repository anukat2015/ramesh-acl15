Title: Like it well enough to buy another
Content:
Purchased this unit 1-1/2 years ago, along with a 3-year service plan from NEW Customer Service for $29.99.  The unit never leaked.  Recently it stopped working, displaying "PF" (probe failure according to the manual).  The repair shop designated by NEW warranties didn't want to fix it so NEW sent a refund totaling the original purchase price.
We just purchased another PAC A120E.  Amazon sent it to us via 2-day FedEx, just like before.  The previous unit ran like a trooper for 1-1/2 years.  If you buy this unit, strongly consider buying the warranty.

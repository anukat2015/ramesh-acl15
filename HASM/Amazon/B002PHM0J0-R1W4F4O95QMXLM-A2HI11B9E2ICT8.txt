Title: Poor Quality Check
Content:
I was very happy with my brand new sony vaio. My joy ended as soon as I opened the box. I saw a little scracth on the laptop. Then as soon as I started the machine and did the setup; it started giving me blue screen errors. Online support was not able to resolve this. After a week of diagnosis they came to know that it had motherboard related issues and this has to be replaced. 
And at the time of replacement Amazon was out of stock so it has to be refunded. Now I will have to pay the 15% restocking charges I guess. If its the case then I see it as a nice business to make money out of a defected product. Lets see!!!

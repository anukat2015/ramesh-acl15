Title: Works well, relatively less noisy
Content:
I just started using one today and I like it compared to a couple of other ceramic heaters I have. This one is less noisy, looks good and includes a remote control. Its a bit taller than my other two ceramic heaters but that's what makes it more effective, I think. Good purchase overall. No complaints so far.

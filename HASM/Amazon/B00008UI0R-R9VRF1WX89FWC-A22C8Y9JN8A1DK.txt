Title: Its a hurricane!
Content:
This is the second canister sweeper I have had. I still have a 1950's sunbeam vacuum cleaner, passed down by mom, that still works great. But I needed a vacuum cleaner for upstairs as they are to cumbersome to haul up and down the stairs. I have used my new Wind Tunnel just once so far and I think I am going to love it! I have a 100 lb. lab, which sheds her hair continuously, and the tunnel reservoir was full of hair. It seemed to suck up every bit of hair. And that was just the entry way and one very small bedroom. The vacuum is very easy to put together and use. My 76 year old mother with arthritis, was able to push and pull it around with ease. The cost at amazon is better than I could find at other stores. I hope it lasts me half as long as my sunbeam has. If the suction remains good, and the automatic cord rewind stay's working well, I may just give it a five star.

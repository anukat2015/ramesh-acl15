Title: Confsion
Content:
This was my second order of the truly excellent Lasko 5141 24 inch Oscillating Ceramic Tower Heater. However the heater never arrived when we needed it. The delivery system totally broke down as UPS tried to deliver it to another address and finally returned it to Amazon, without any explanation. After waitng some 4-5 days for the item we noted that Amazon had refunded the money and after several days of emails ,Amazon were not clear what was happening and told us we would have to start the order process from the start. By this time the weather had changed and a heater was no long essential. Most disappointing.
I do not want this review to reflect on the high quality heater, only the delivery process

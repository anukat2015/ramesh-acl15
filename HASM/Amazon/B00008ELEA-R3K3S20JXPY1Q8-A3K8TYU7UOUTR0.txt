Title: This is the percolator to get!
Content:
First of all, perked coffee is the way to go. If you love coffee, you will never have a hotter, better cup of coffee that the perked method. 
Once you have decided to go the perked way, do yourself a favor and get this model. I had the Melita percolator, and it just didn't have any staying power. It started making irregular coffee after about a couple of months (temperature not consistent, not heating up correctly, making poor coffee) until finally the glass bulb on top just broke off. 
Then I bought this Faberware Percolator, and I have been happy ever since. It is simply much better made that the Melita. I have been using it about 1 1/2 years now, and waited this long just to make sure of its quality before posting a review. 
It makes an incredible, hot (and the great thing about perk coffee is its hotness) cup of coffee. --Mykal Banta

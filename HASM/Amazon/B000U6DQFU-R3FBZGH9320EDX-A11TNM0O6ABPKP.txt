Title: Nice vacuum, but could be better
Content:
The first Kurv delivered to me was DOA- the internal battery wouldn't take a charge.  Through Amazon's return policy I had a new one in just a few days which works perfectly fine.  The vacuum itself looks great sitting in the corner and the charging indicator light is a nice touch.  The chocolate is a great color to disappear in my home but when guests do notice it they are very interested.
I chose this handheld vac based on its size as it's aimed to clean up small areas in my living room and my chinchilla cage.  Speaking of cage duty, it sucks up their small poop just fine, but the larger clumps of bedding can get stuck.  The small size of the Kurv is great for getting around in there and the small inlet is perfect for hitting just the right spots that need to be cleaned.
I do feel that it's a bit lacking in power because it seems like I have to get it much closer to things than I should before it picks them up.  I suppose it's a trade-off between aesthetics and power, but it does feel weak at times and I didn't buy it just to look nice.  Still, compared to the dismal competition in the "dust buster" class of vacuums, I'm happy with my purchase.

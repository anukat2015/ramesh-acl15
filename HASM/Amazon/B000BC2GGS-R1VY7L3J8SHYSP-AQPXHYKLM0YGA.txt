Title: Almost a great heater
Content:
I recently bought this heater based on consumer reports ratings and I like almost everything about it except one thing.  The thermostat doesn't work every time.  So, half the time it is turned on, it just stays on until the room is over 90 degrees even though the desired temperature is set at 72 degrees.  I am guessing there is a defect in my unit but it seems to be a fairly common defect as I have read similar complaints on Amazon.

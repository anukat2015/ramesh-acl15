Title: Easy to use, intelligent
Content:
This vacuum cleaner is amazing.  I have always been partial to canister vacuums, because every home I have lived in has had a combination of hardwood and carpeting flooring.  It's unbelievable how much dirt, pet hair, and carpet fuzz this thing picks up.  I've had problems in the past with canister vacuums overheating and shutting down.  This one never quits.  What impressed me most, besides the its obviously great cleaning capabilities, is how intelligent the design is.  
There is a sturdy handle to pick up the canister itself, and all the power buttons are on the handle.  The cord winds itself neatly inside the cansiter automatically with the press of a foot pedal - and the winder always works!  The dirt bin is very easy to empty, and the filter is very easy to clean, and it always fits right back together.  It's an intuitive machine.  I bought one for my mother for Christmas, and she loves it, too.

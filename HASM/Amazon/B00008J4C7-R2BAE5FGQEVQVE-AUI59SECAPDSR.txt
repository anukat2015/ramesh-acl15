Title: great little machine!
Content:
I don't get all the negative reviews at all, this little vacuum is really strong, great on BOTH hard floors and carpets, the attachments are ideal. The only reason it ddn't get 5 stars from me is because the cord is way too short - you have to change plugs to vacuum a larger area or use an extension cable. 
For $99, it's a bargain. More powerful than any vacuum I've had before, and you can see how much dirt you're picking up which is very satisfying.

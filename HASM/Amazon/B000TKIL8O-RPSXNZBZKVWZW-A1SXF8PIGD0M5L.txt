Title: Dayton 1VNX3 Electric Oil Filled Space Heater With Analog Thermostat
Content:
This product works excellent:) I had it for about 2 1/2 years and it still works as when I first bought it. Only 400 Watts and works great in my 16 X 13. Because my husband and I have a new born, when the building heat is off, I turn it on and we feel the temperature difference.  My husband is an H.V.A.C Tech so he has it by the window to stop the cold air from creeping in. It's the quietest portable heater I ever bought.  Makes absolutely no noise. That's a plus for us. Keeps us and the baby warm.  I also bought one for my cousin's office space and she loves it.  Highly recommend.

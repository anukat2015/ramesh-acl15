Title: Worse vacuum yet
Content:
I have used Hoover vacuums for over 30 years and have fairly good luck with them.  My last was my first bagless and I really liked it but it had started to go through belts with a vengeance. When looking at new vacuums I found the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser and having two long haired dogs and a cat decided it was for me.  At first I was impressed by the amount of hair it sucked up but then noticed that although the canister looks large it only fills halfway up and my vacuum only fills on one side for some reason.  This means I have to repeatedly empty the canister and each time I almost have to go outside or else it drops dirt all over my just vacuumed floor.  In addition, the filter quickly clogs with dog hair and it is difficult to put the filter back in as you have to do so blindly.  Finally, the hose nozzle is too fat to fit under most pieces of furniture and whenever I use the hose and attachments the whole vacuum tips over and has fallen on me more than once.  If it wasn't so heavy I would probably have tossed it out the window by now.  Now that I have spent the money I feel I have to live with this vacuum for a few years at least but I wish I had spent more money and gotten a better vacuum or at least gone back to the Hoovers which are the same price as the Bissells.

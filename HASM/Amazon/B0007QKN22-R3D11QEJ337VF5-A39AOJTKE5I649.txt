Title: Money WELL spent
Content:
I have to say that as a fledgling photographer i was very unsure of what camera to buy, but after reading a lot of reviews and talking to a lot of pros i was directed to the Canon Rebel as a phenominal camer ato start with.  Easy to use, simplistic design, sturdy, reliable, and still produces professional quality pictures.  I must admit that the options and settings that are available are a bit much for me but the cameras auto selection takes excellent pics until you figure it all out.  
I HIGHLY recommend this camera to anyone that is looking to get started  in photography.

Title: Convenient and easy to use
Content:
This is a real lightweight heater. Itis quite warm within 3-4 ft of it, and yet not hot to touch. I am not sure the convection part (10% of its function) is very effective. Instead of an Actual Temperature based thermostat it has an analog dial, like the temp settings of the car heater. This is not a problem necessarily, just that it might have been better to have a thermostat that u can read, especially when things are not that expensive anymore..

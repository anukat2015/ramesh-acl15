Title: Great Camera
Content:
This camera is great - it take wonderful pictures.  Easy to use and the price was right.
You get a good lens with purchase.
The HD videos are nice but they do come through rather large.  But I am still learning on if and how I can size them down.
This camera is also great if you have active children.  My 3 year old is very active and always on the go.  Now that I have this camera she is not a blurr.  And I have some great action shots.

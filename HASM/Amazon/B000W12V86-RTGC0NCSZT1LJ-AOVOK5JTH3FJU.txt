Title: Some flaws, but a tremendous value nonetheless
Content:
Let's get the negative out of the way.
CON:
- Yes, the right shift button is small. Is that annoying? Sure. Is it a deal breaker? Not in the least. You get used to it after a while.
- The battery life is some 2.5-3 hours. Not horrendous, but you will definitely want to invest in an extra, longer lasting battery. 
- There are cooling vents on the bottom of the laptop. The "feet" on the laptop raise the case and allow for proper ventilation.  If, like me, you are fond of working with the laptop directly on the bed, that can quickly lead to overheating since you cover the vents. Always use this laptop on a flat surface, even when in bed. A $20 cushioned laptop desk can make your experience more comfortable and pleasant all the way around.
- The TV Tuner heats up quickly.
- Vista. Oy! This not a problem with the laptop itself so much as its a problem in general. Vista is a memory hog. Even when you strip it down to basics and ditch the heavy GUI, Vista still consumes more system resources than XP. Sadly, at the time of this writing, HP doesn't provide a downgrade strategy for this model. Their support site does have _some_ XP drivers for the dv9650us, but none for the SCSI/RAID hard disk controllers. That makes manual downgrading nearly impossible.
Okay. Those are the major negatives to the dv9650us. You might be wondering how I came up to a 5/5 score then. Surely, I must be mistaken. Stay with me.
PRO:
- 17" 1440x900 Widescreen: First of all, the screen is crisp, clear, bright, and utterly gorgeous. Best of all, you can manually turn down the brightness
- 2GB RAM: Naturally, Vista is a bit of a hog, but 2GB is a great deal for this price. Many laptops in this price range still only offer 1GB; some less. Better yet you can upgrade to 4GB if you need the extra RAM. As someone who does a lot of graphics and video work, that's great.
- Core2Duo: Some of you may scream that it's only a T5250 1.5GHz and not a 2.0GHz. Believe me, that is REALLY not a big issue. In fact, the 1.5GHz actually performs nearly as well as my Pentium4 3GHz (HT) and PentiumD 3.4GHz (Dual Core) desktop machines. The multi-threaded performance is very solid, which is great if you use 3D software that takes advantage of the multiple cores.
- 320GB Hard Drive Space: You may be thinking, "Well, I've got a TB on my PC. What's the big deal?" 320GB on a laptop, at this sub-$1,500 price is a wonderful bargain. Very roomy. Some people might find it annoying that the 320GB is actually 2 separate 160GB hard drives, but I prefer it. Keeping your data away from the applications is a smart move though. This way, if the OS somehow gets corrupted, your data stays safe. Plus, if you use Photoshop, keeping your scratch files on a separate drive (not partition) improves performance.
- NVidia GeForce 8600M GS: It's not the top of the line GeForce 8 model, but it is definitely more than powerful enough to handle current games. Desktop 3D performance on a laptop is hard to find, especially at this price. Most sub-$1,500 laptops resort to integrated video. A dedicated 3D card with its own, separate 256MB of RAM pretty sweet.
- HD DVD: Okay, I haven't used this feature yet. I'll admit it. My movie collection is still old school DVD. Still, it's a nice option to have. Most laptops don't include next gen DVD players. Those that do, such as the Sony Vaio models, include Blu-Ray and often cost more if you try to match overall feature sets.
- Hybrid Analog/HD TV Tuner: I am a sucker for this one. The include antenna does a decent, albeit predictable, job of picking up analog signals. However, it really shines with HD signals. I was not even aware that my area was already broadcasting HD over the air yet. This tuner & antenna pick up the HD signals perfectly every time - cable quality reception every time. As an added bonus, the dv9650us includes TWO media center remote controls. The first one is a much more standard sized remote with external USB IR receiver. That's nice and all, but you don't always want to lug around that setup. The second option is the included portable remote, which conveniently stores in the expansion slot and communicates with the built-in IR port.
- ON/OFF button for the touch pad. Such a small feature. So convenient. If you use an external mouse, you can just turn off the touch pad and never worry about accidentally moving the cursor when typing.
- TWO (2) Headphone ports: Great for those long trips where you want to watch a movie with a friend, but don't want to bother everybody else around you.
- Integrated web cam. Some people may gripe that external web cams would provide crisper video. However, as a portable solution for teleconferencing, you could do much worse. It's not meant for creating your next Youtube masterpiece. Why should you expect it to so? I'm in the camp that favors bang for the buck. 
- Solid construction: Unlike the Sony Vaio laptops, the HP Pavillion doesn't feel fragile to the touch. You'll still have to treat it with the same respect that you would any other non-rugged laptop, but it doesn't feel at all like a toy. While 7.7lbs might seem heavy for an average portable, remember that we're talking about a 17" widescreen machine that's brimming with desktop level features. In that regard, it's a very manageable weight.
- Attractive design: The smooth, glass-like exterior with its embedded ripple design makes this one of the prettiest laptops to behold, even when closed and turned off. Your friends and colleagues will want to dump their stocky, utilitarian looking laptops in a heartbeat. If fingerprints or smudges easily annoy you then you may want to invest in a handkerchief. However, if you're an iPod or Playstation Portable owner you're probably used to this non-issue already. The sleek, futuristic design is more than worth the occasional fingerprint.
The HP Pavilion DV9650US is not just a steal at this price, but also a miracle. Desktop features and performance without the scary laptop price. I must have researched a couple of dozen laptops before settling on the DV9650US. At the time of this writing, you simply will NOT find a more feature rich laptop for the price. I usually steer far away from HP desktops, but they have done a bang up job on this laptop. In a word, "Wow!"

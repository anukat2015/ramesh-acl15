Title: Useless
Content:
Where to start.  The hose is way too stiff.  The power connector keeps coming unplugged as you vacuum because it isn't meant to swivel more than 180 degrees.  When it pulls free it bends the prongs so you have to keep bending them back to get it to fit.  After doing this a number of times, I think they are about to break off, so have resorted to zip tieing the cord to the handle.  That complicates bad replacement. The hose is just thin plastic so it will kink shut pretty easily. The power cord is so short you are constantly stopping, unplugging it, and plugging it in again somewhere else.  Have added an extension cord to it, but that sort of defeats the retractable cord.  The bare floor attachment is almost impossible to remove from the pipe after use as it wedges itself on so tight.  Bags are small and expensive.  Where the pipe fits into the wand, there is a piece of metal on the inside that catches all kinds of hair/lint that eventually plug the hose. After putting up with it for a year, the hose ripped completely appart.  For $300, its massively over priced, and totally impractical.  Returned it under warranty, but you couldn't pay me to take a replacement.  Will not buy another one.

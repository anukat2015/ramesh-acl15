Title: Good for workouts!
Content:
I live for my iPods but after destroying my nano in a traumatic treadmill accident, I decided to get an iTouch and a shuffle for workouts. The shuffle was cheaper, so I got that first. :)I love it actually. It is very lightweight and can be clipped to the end of my t-shirt while I exercise without getting in the way. And I just put on my top workout songs which I probably wouldn't put on the iTouch when I get it cause there are just certain songs that motivate me to get moving and not necessarily for every day listening. The thing that most struck me is the headphones though. I had the 1st Gen nano for the last 3-4 yrs (?)and those headphones were painful and always slipping out. The ones with the shuffle are smaller and neater and fit perfectly. Not to mention the new green colour is very cute.Very good buy!

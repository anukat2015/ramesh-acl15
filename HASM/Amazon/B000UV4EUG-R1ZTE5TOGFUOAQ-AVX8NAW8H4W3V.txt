Title: Beats Nano by a Mile
Content:
I love this product.  I was pretty stunned when I went to look at the new nano and find it did not have a radio included, I needed one for my gym.  Having been fed up with itunes for a while and the propriertary nature of it I decided to look around.  This device is really sensible in including:
Voice Recorder
Radio
MP3 Player
Audible Compliant (I use this system)
WMA and DRM compliant (I download books from the Chicago Library)
Plays Video
8Gb for $110 
It's light, the screen is fantastic as is the menu system and the ability to put placeholders on audio books and videos so you can return to your spot the next time you fancy it.  Really great tool.
Sound quality is good too.  It does not feel as good quality from a build perspective being entirely plastic but providing you look after it it shoudl be fine.
So so far I am well happy.  Using media player and dragging and dropping makes me happy and it pics up Podcasts.  
I can still download pod casts on itunes and tell this device/media player to monitor the itunes pod cast directory.  You can just synch them onto this device so there is no need to lose that vast repository of podcast resources that you can find in itunes.  I have already downloaded several podcasts, 5 books etc.
Very cool.

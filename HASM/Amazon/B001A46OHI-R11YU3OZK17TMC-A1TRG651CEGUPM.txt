Title: Good heater for a small room
Content:
After reading all the reviews out here, I bought this product a week ago and I am not totally satisfied with this product. I was looking to keep my 10'x13' room warm as my windows are not well insulated. At the max setting of 80degrees, this decently heated to room to ~70degrees. You feel nice and warm when you keep it within 5-6ft from you. I recommend this if you are looking to heat your small room or just the area around you. I did like the thermostat feature, Low & High setting and easy to select temperature settings.

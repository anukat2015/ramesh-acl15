Title: Light Fast Laptop - Overall Good Bargain
Content:
I recently traded my work laptop in for a desktop and the laptop at home was a desktop replacement and over three years old so I started to do research on something smaller and lighter to kind of replace both.  I wanted something that was easily portable but also had enough processing power which would address my daily PC needs. I'm not a gamer, nor a power user, but I probably fall into the 90% of PC/Laptop users, I use it for some Microsoft product needs (Excel, PowerPoint, Word, etc) as well as email, iTunes, surfing and streaming some flicks once in a while.
So I was looking for something which could do all of these tasks, be able to hook it up to two external monitors, have a decent hard drive capacity for my photos and music, come with 4 gig of ram with the cap being 8 gig.  I wanted this to be a little lighter than my previous laptops as I am going to be traveling more....well through a lot of research it came down to the Acer.
Now I did have some reservations regarding buying an Acer, they haven't been known for their reliability in the past...but the more research I did, the more I found this laptop to be the one for me. 
First of all, the screen is fantastic, very clear.  Windows 7 runs like a champ, I connected to my home network with very little effort (no more trying to figure out what type of network security you are running), its very quiet and very cool.  
I'm only a week in using this, but so far...so good.
If you are looking to use (2) external monitors, I suggest using the Kensington Display Adapter, it works like a champ with the Windows 7 drivers available on their website.
I think this is a great laptop for a great value.

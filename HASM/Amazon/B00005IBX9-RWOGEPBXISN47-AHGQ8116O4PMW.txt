Title: Very Reliable and Easy to Use
Content:
I just purchase my second Cuisinart DCC-1200.  The first one finally fizzled out after much use.  A few years ago, I purchased a Capresso coffee maker for my husband's birthday.  We both love strong coffee and after much research, I decided that the Capresso was the best.  We were so disappointed.  Our Cuisinart made much better coffee, it was hotter and stronger.  The only thing that I can say for the Capresso was that the coffee was not as bitter.  After a few years of suffering, cause the Capresso costs so much and we couldn't just give up on it, my husband said "By another Cuisinart!"  So, our $160 coffee maker went into the cabinet and I bought another Cuisinart.  The only thing that I don't like about this unit that I bought is the fact that I chose the dark metal. I thought that it would be easier to clean, but it is polished and actually shows more spots.  So, I would recommend that you choose either the brushed steel or the black, if you don't like cleaning your coffee maker all of the time.

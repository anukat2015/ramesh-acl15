Overall good but a few problems need urgent fixing. One glass screen is too reflective matte option would really solve this problem for the 90% of us who hate looking at our own reflection or stray lights!!! You just cannot use this computer for mobile use unless you are a vampire and like dark places!!! Lack of side speakers is a disappointment do I have to upgrade to the 15inch to get those. Lastly give us the option for blue ray it is about time we can watch blue ray movies on a Mac. When they fix the reflection this would be a super value please apple add an anti glare option we are all willing to pay extra for it.

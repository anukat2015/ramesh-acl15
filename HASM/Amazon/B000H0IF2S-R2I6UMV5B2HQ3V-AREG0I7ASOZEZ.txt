Title: So easy a Six year old can use it
Content:
OK, I gave in and purchased an IPOD for my six year old for Christmas. She loves it.  Not a major investment for a child, but one that will last for some time.  Use of the device is simple and loading the machine using Itunes only takes seconds.  Sound output is decent. The device is rugged and withstands the beating only a child can give it.  The clip on device is a nice touch.
If you don't want to carry your whole song catalog (5000 songs or more) -- this a good value and product.

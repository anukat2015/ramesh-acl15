Title: Great all in one!!! great looking too
Content:
I needed the temperature in my baby's room to stay the same even though we're in a small apartment. This really did the trick. It looks great is very compact compared to other ugly large heater humidifiers AND it is both a heater and humidifier so even when it warms up in there it does feel so dry. It also has a tip over feature, which or safety is great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I wish you could operate the humidifer separate from the heater but you can't. Can't have it all I guess. Oh, and we have a modern looking apartment and this fits right in!

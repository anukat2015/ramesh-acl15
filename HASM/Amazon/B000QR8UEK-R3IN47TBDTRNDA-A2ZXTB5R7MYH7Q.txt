Title: 5 Star space heater, but...
Content:
I bought this at the end of the summer when it was on sale.
I wanted a heater that wouldn't turn off when it thought my bedroom was warm enough.  I had also seen this heater featured in a news piece on TV last winter.
Unfortunately it does not heat my room very well.  I have another fan forced heater that moves the temperature up faster and keeps it there.  But if you want a heater that you can place next to you to warm you up, this heater is 5 stars.  I am using it now in my livingroom for TV viewing.  I don't think it is any louder than any other fan forced heater, and I actually like the white noise.  For quiet heating you have to use an oil-filled radiator.

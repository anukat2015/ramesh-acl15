Title: Not bad at all!
Content:
I bought this product for my mom, who drinks coffee...but is the only one in our family to do so regularly.  Operating it is simple enough; just load the coffee grounds into the (reusable) filter, flip the switch, and voila...coffee brewed and in the mug in about 5 minutes.  
There are a couple of drawbacks to this machine though:
1) It doesn't have an "Off" switch.  Once you flip the switch down, it will start to boil the water.  This usually isn't an issue if you already have the cup sitting there, but when the switch is flipped (but you don't know it) and you plug it in, it starts to boil whatever is inside and you have to wait until the light turns off automatically before you can load your next brew in.  This can get a bit annoying if you're constantly plugging/unplugging it to move it around and such.
2) There's no timer.  It only turns on when you flip the switch.  However, this one can be easily solved if you leave it plugged into a timer-based electrical outlet (that others have probably mentioned as well).  I haven't personally done this, but it should work just fine.
Overall, this coffee-maker brews great coffee, and just enough for one person.  The mug has a great feel to it, is easy to handle, and seems sturdy enough to withstand a few falls.  The coffee inside also seems to stay well insulated for at least an hour or so.  For the price I paid (~$20) this was a very good investment!  5/5 stars.

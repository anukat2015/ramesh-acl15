Title: Powerful Little Vacuum!
Content:
I am a person who really likes a good vacuum cleaner, and I am very pleased with this one!  It has wonderful suction and power for such a small machine, and it is very easy to use and clean.  The electric wand/rug cleaner attachment, which can be turned on for rugs and off for floors, is a bit heavy to move easily in small places, however.  My solution to this issue is to use the basic wand and brush attachment from my Electrolux vacuum,  since these parts are of universal sizes, and this works quite well.  Overall, I would highly recommend this vacuum.

Title: Bissell Pet Hair Eraser
Content:
The vacuum cleaner does a great job with both dirt and pet hair.  It is amazing what you find in your carpet the first time you use it.  I especially like that you can wash most of the parts that come into contact with the dirt.  The HEPA filter, that cannot be washed, is still remarkably clean after several uses of the vacuum cleaner.

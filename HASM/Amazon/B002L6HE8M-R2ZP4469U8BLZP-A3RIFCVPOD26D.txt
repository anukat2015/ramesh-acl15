Title: Great, despite some set-up trouble.
Content:
The Nano has worked great for me once I got it properly set up.  However, set-up took some time.  When I first tried to connect it with my computer (Dell PC running Vista), iTunes would not recognize the iPod.
I called Apple Support, and although it took about two hours on the phone with them (due somewhat to the speed of my computer), we eventually got everything working perfectly.  I ended up having to manually uninstall and delete everything connected with iTunes and then reinstall.
Once I got set up, though, it has worked perfectly and I am very happy with the product and with the support experience.

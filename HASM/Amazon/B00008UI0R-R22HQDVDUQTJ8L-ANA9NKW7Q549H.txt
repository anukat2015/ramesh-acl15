Title: Hoover Windtunnel Electric Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
A fundamentally defective machine. I am an independent housekeeper who was drawn to this vacuum for its features: portable, bagless HEPA filter, with great range of attachments including a vibrating carpet attachment. However, after experiencing the same problem with the connections on THREE Windtunnels (the buttons stopped working, the connection at the handle and at the base of the hose all stopped working--within two months of purchase with one model)I have decided never to buy another.

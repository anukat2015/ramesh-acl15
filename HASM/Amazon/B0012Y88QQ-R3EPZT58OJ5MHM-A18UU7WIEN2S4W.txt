Title: Will wonders never cease?
Content:
The speed of the autofocus, startup and fps are incredible. I moved up from a Canon Rebel Xti which was good but the Xsi is even better.
My one gripe is the change of medium even thought the new card type works fine the need to buy a new medium is annoying.

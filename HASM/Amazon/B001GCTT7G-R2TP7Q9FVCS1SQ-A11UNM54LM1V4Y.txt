Title: Simply the best laptop out there for the laptop user
Content:
If your work depends on video production, get the Macbook Pro. Other that that, the new Macbook is all what you need for your daily life. Macs are the way to go, don't waste your time buying a Windows machine. 
I am upgrading from a Powerbook G4 12'', so I spent several weeks deciding between the early 2008 Pro's or the new Unibody Macbooks. I am very happy with my decision, this babies are FAST! and must important, they run cold and quiet. I have it since Jan 7th, and I haven't heard the fans turn on yet. Amazing. I've had 5 portable Macs and this is my fave. 
The trackpad is also a major reason for my choice. Once you get used to it, You won't go to the old one. Great invention from apple. Use one, two, three and four fingers for different actions. Wooo! excellent Apple!!
The Screen: I was not sure about the glossy LED screen, so I asked a friend to bring her new Macbook and we compared side by side against Matte LCD and I DON'T WANT A MATTE LCD ANYMORE! This Macbook Glossy rocks. Colors are vivid and reflections are not an issue. Who works anyway with a lamp behind??? Get LED and save the earth. 
No Firewire: Maybe a shame for those video producers, but hey! MacBook pros are THE option. 
My last recommendation: If you can spend $300 more, go with the 2.4 backlit keyboard. Just for the keyboard it's worth it, and additionally you'll get more speed and more HD.

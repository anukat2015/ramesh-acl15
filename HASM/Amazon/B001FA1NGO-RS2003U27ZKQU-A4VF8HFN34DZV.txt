Title: good adittion to the ipod family
Content:
this is my first ipod and I am very happy with it so far. the cover flow turning on when you turn it sideways is really no big deal. how hard is it to hold it upright for a few seconds? plus you hardly ever have to adjust the volume. the new features make it great! I'm amazed at how small it is!

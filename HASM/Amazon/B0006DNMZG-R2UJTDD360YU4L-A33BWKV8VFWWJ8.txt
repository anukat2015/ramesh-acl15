Title: Nice little heater for small rooms
Content:
This heater is quick and efficient.  I use it in my office and it does a great job with a small space.  I'm not completely sold on the 360-degree vents--since it's not sitting in the middle of my floor, I think a unidirectional heater would have been fine.

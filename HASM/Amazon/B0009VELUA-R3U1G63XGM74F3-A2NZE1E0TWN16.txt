Title: DO NOT BUY !!!!!   will quit working with no recourse
Content:
Cuisinart Coffee-On-Demand Coffee Maker
Do not buy this coffee maker. I bought one in January 2007 to have it fail December 2007. I did not have the receipt for warranty so I was stupid enough to purchase a second unit on December 24, 2007. The second unit quit working April 2008. Cuisinart three warranty is worthless, it might as well be a lifetime warranty since you can not have it serviced and have to PAY for the work this will be the last CUISINART product I will ever purchase.

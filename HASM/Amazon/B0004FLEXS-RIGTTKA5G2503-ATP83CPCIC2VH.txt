Title: does what it is supposed to
Content:
The coffeepot makes coffee, turns on and off correctly with its timer and is fairly economical.  It's easy to use, easy to clean and you can pour a cup of coffee from the carafe without spilling.  I like strong coffee and I use plenty of grounds.  The grounds in the basket splash back on the hot water dispenser (meaning it must be cleaned) which is my only criticism.

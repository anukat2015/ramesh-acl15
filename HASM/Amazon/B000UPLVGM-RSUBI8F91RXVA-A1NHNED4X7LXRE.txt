Title: Piece of crap cheapo thermostat that won't work!
Content:
I ordered this thermostat to run my new Mr. Heater Big Maxx 75K BTU natural gas unit heater.  It was defective and won't work. My installer checked it with his meter and it indeed is defective.  It's obviously a cheap imitation of a thermostat.  Don't buy one.  I've decided to just buy one locally.

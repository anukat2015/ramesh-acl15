Title: Dented badly.  Heats well, but the timer is broken upon arrival.
Content:
I bought this heater because I needed one and it seemed like a great deal.  I believe this model sold for about $85 regularly.  I got it for the factory refurbed price of $46.  I read other people's reviews where they said theirs came all banged up or dented, and this was the case for me too.  Mine has a nice large dent right on the front left side, VERY noticeable.  But the heating part works great!  The timer, however, does NOT work at all.  It did NOT come with instructions of any kind.  This item has already sold out at Amazon, as I had a feeling it would, considering the price of heating will go up this winter.  I had a heater like this last year, and it is perfect for heating a room that is roughly 500 square feet.  (The one I had last year I gave to my mom and she loves it too!)  It is super quiet.  I feel lucky I got one when I did.  What made this a great deal was I used my Amacon gift certificates I earned doing surveys online, and I got it for FREE this way.  It didn't cost me a cent, and it came with free shipping.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the huge dent, (which I expected) and also because the timer does not work.

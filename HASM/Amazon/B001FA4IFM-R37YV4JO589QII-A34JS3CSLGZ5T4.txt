I ordered this Monday and it arrived around 2pm today on Wed. I read and hooked it up like it said and WOW it puts out more heat than the bigger one I use in the frontroom and soooooo quiet! I will mostly use it in my front bedroom/computer room and I have to keep it twice as far from my desk than the other small one I had. It is smaller than I thought but gosh it puts out more heat than I expected and you can't even hear a blower on it but sure feels like it has a good one built in.     It did have a smell to it when I started it up but all new heaters do so I opened the window and had a fan going just to push flumes out the window and it didn't take long to do that about 20 mins. and it's ok now so be sure when you first start it up to do it in a room where you can open a window and run it on high for about 20 mins. to get rid of the fumes of it being new and ect. Best part is that there is NO NOISE at all!

Title: Very pleased !!!!
Content:
I love this computer.  It is my first laptop, purchased for everyday computing tasks like email and internet.  It boots up and opens applications quickly.  I even loaded my first Call of Duty PC game on it and it runs without issues.  The keyboard feels great and the pointing device is smoother than many other models I tried in the store before purchasing from Amazon.  It is a joy to sit back and use.

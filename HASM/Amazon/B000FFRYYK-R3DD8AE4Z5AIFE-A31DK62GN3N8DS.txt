Title: Dribbles more than a point guard...
Content:
This would be a perfect coffee maker if the pot didn't leak - NO gush - NO HEMORRAGE coffee each and EVERY time you try to pour a cup. The speed of a Bunn has never been questioned, the quality of what is in the cup is great and the idea to eliminate the "warmer/burner/fire-starter" was genius. However! The design of the pot itself is about as bad as "New Coke", BetaMax and Lawn Darts rolled together.

Title: My second one!! It's great!!
Content:
I bought this vacuum at sears 6 years ago. I have five kids and a dog and constantly need to use it. It's still running strong but had to move overseas and didn't want to ship it. So I'm getting a new one and cant wait! It's not only great for hard floors and the strap makes stairs a "breeze"  but my neighbor was always borrowing it to vacuum his car and said it was the best car vacuum he'd ever used!!! ( guess who got it when we moved)

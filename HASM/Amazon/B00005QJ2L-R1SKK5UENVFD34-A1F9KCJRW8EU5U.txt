Title: Excellent product.
Content:
This laptop is quite useful..battery life is excellent at lasting for about 2.5 to 3 hours with normal use.  I finished Star wars Episode 1 before it was close to the battery running out.   The graphics are so so, this laptop is definately not ment for a gamer.  If you want a gaming laptop...get one with a Geforce 2 Go in it.       But other than that, this is an excellent laptop.

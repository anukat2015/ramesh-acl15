Title: nice heater!
Content:
I bought this heater and have had it for about a month now. It is really good, pretty quiet! I have a fairly cold drafty room so this heater works well. I love the remote feature! It is helpful if I don't want to get out of bed on a cold night. And, Yes, like other people have mentioned about the really bright backlight issue, I see it too, but it isn't too bad! It is rather quiet and the oscilatting movement spreads the heat around.  I hear a lot of clicking noises when it initially heats up but I think that it maybe due to the plastic heating up and therefore expanding!
Overall, A good buy.....

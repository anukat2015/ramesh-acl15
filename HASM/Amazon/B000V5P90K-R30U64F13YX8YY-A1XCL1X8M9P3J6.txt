Title: Check out lenses, too
Content:
I have bought many Nikon cameras, and am in the process of switching over to Canon.  Some of the Nikon digital bodies do compete with the Canon digital bodies, but Nikon seems to have given up on making good lenses.  
Try to find a F1.4 or F1.2 in any focal length made by Nikon these days...  The really nice 28mm f/1.4 AF Lens Nikon discontinued is selling for about three grand (used!) since they are hard to come by.

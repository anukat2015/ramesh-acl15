Title: So far so good
Content:
The winter of 09-10 killed the heat pump compressor that heated and cooled my upstairs (two large open rooms). Because of its age, I had to either replace the whole system (air handler, too), or take a chance on replacing just the compressor with hope nothing else major fails. I decided on the latter and bought the Delonghi for auxiliary heat. My plan is to run the repaired heat pump as little as possible in winter and use it primarily for cooling in summer. Since it was the end of winter, the Delonghi didn't get a full workout, but it worked far better than I'd anticipated. I'm still trying to find the best settings, but I think it's going to do the job. I was very concerned about leaving it on 24-7, but after checking the outlet and cord (many times!) for heat buildup, I relaxed and let it do its thing. Since I didn't use it for a full season, I withheld a star. I may need another one to satisfactorily heat the entire space for a full season, but wouldn't hesitate buying the same unit. It's clean, quiet, takes up little space -- and it works.

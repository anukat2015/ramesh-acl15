Title: Very pleased with this heater/radiator
Content:
I picked one of these up about a month ago and have been perfectly pleased with it. It warms my bedroom quietly and effectively throughout the night, allowing me to turn down my main thermostat an extra degree or two so the heat doesn't run all night.
I specifically looked for this style of radiating heater in order to avoid the air being dried out by a more traditional heater-with-a-fan. I've used this for the past month and been very much pleased with it.

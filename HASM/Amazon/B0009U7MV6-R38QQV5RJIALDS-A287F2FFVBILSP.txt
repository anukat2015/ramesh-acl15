Title: very pleased
Content:
A photography course in school opened my mind to it. I then persued a DSLR, did tons of research, shopping around, and came down to this. If you take advantage of the manual controls, photos that surpass point-and-shoot. The AF is amazing, 100% accurate (so far). It has a nice range of controls to get creative with, which are conveniant and "right there". Noise at ISO 1600-3200 is acceptable. Fast and responcive. Value. RAW conversion software very simple and right down to the point (and advanced adjustments too).
Cons:
If you are switching to DSLR from digital point-and-shoot, it may take a bit of time to get comfortable with having to use the viewfinder all of the time. Not numorus, but only a few times the AF did not lock and release the shutter. I am not  optimistic with the auto white balance. Info in the viewfinder (shutter speed, apature, and so on) not so easaly seen when it is really bright outside (not a big deal to think any less positive of the camera).
Final opinion:
Amazing camera when you do not swich it to AUTO. Two thumbs up, highly recomended as a starter DSLR =).

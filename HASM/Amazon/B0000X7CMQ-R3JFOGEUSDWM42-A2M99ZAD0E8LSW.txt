Title: A Standout Coffee Maker
Content:
I'm going on five years of perfect performance from my Zojirushi and I thought I'd post a quick review. Five years back I had purchased a different machine (can't even recall the brand) and it quit within 3-4 months. I understand man-made items aren't perfect, but ... this was frustrating. A waste of $$ and more stuff for a landfill. After searching around online I decided on Zojirushi - in fact, I bought two. One was a 2 cup machine, the other a full-blown 10 cup brewer. They have both performed flawlessly and if/when the day comes, we'll buy another Zojirushi.

Title: Broken and No Customer Service
Content:
After two years of light, weekend-only use with a city water source of soft lake water, the descale light stayed on constantly.  Water flow practically stopped with a lot of spitting and hissing.  Water would backflow into the resevoir.  There is no question that the unit is out of warranty.  Customer service said they don't repair ("it's too costly"), they don't have instructions for an owner to disassemble and reassemble.  They actually agreed that it's a throw-away product.  Very good coffee for a cup or two on the weekend or when entertaining for a couple of years without having to brew a whole pot.  A little expensive at 50 cents a cup for the k-cups but you pay for convenience.  But there is somethong wrong with our consumer society when we accept a $100 product as a throw-away.  I give it 3 stars because I got two years out of it, the coffee variety concept is good, the coffee decent, and a single cup of coffee is super convenient.  Based only on customer service and product reliabilty I would have given it one star. Needless to say I'm not buying another one.

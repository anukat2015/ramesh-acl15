Title: love it
Content:
This is my first DSLR, I don't know how to use most of the function it come with, but I'm learning now.
This camera is easy to learn, the manual come with it is very detail and easy to understand (for a first time user). The Kit lens is great for everyday use.
The basic auto mode is easy to use, and the picture is much better then my older camera, I'm very happy about that. 
I took the camera to an Airshow (a week after the camera arrived), with just auto mode, and addition telephoto lens, I got many great pictures.  So far I'm very satisfy with it.

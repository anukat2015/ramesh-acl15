Title: Vonado dvh A+
Content:
The dvh works well.  Digital control is easy to use.  Easily keeps my 14x16 bedroom at 70 on 25 degree nights with low setting.  We set the dvh on 70 low, and the central on 63, seperating the bedroom from the main house.  Hopefully running the central heat less will save $$.  The unit puts out more heat than we use, but we use it as a suppliment.  Don't buy if you are in a large area that cannot be isolated from cold air.  The unit is a heated fan, so it will move the cold air into the area near the heater, heating the entire area if it can.  If the area is too large it will not do much good.  In my case our bed is against an outside brick wall.  The heater does a good job of keeping the air moving so that it doesn't get cooled by the exterior wall.  It keeps the temperature even in the room as described in advertisement.

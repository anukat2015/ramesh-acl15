Title: 5 stars for the body, 3 stars for the lens
Content:
I've had this combo for about three months and have almost 7,000 captures.  The body is fantastic!  I love the features, ease of use and quality.  The kit lens, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired.  After less than three weeks use there was a huge chunk (not a speck) of debris on the inside of the front lens element.  The build quality is less than acceptable even by my standards - there is too much play in the front element when fully extended and when hanging from a neck strap the lens always extends all the way leaving it more susceptible to damage.  If I were to do it again, I would save the money to invest in a prime or L lens.

Title: more than hot chocolate
Content:
I bought this because my nephews LOVE hot chocolate. This machine really is great to have around. It keeps it at the perfect temp and using water even seems to make the cocoa richer than when you mix it on your own. I really like this for coffee drinks too. It is perfect for hot milk thats frothy to add to coffee. I have used this at least four times a week. & kids can serve themselves. It can stay on for hours and you have hot chocolate ready when you want it. It is a little hard to clean but not if you add warm water right after using the machine. the spout and frother button makes this better than any other machine ive seen for cocoa.

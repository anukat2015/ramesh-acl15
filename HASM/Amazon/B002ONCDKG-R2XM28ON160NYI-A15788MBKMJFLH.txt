Title: Very Bad Touch Pad
Content:
Very Bad Touch Pad: I got this laptop 2 days back. It is a great performance laptop, good "Price to Performance" buy - only if you plan to use a mouse with it. The Touch Pad provided is really bad. Its very difficult to point to a specific location, and due to the type of material used to make the touch pad - its difficult for you to select the text with cursor. Its slippery sometimes and sticky other times. 
I will try explaining this problem to Amazon for a return, since I intend to use this laptop without a mouse, on a couch or in areas where carrying a mouse is not convenient. If you plan on buying it - please try using it at Best Buy or HH Gregg for some time before ordering it online. I believe some other reviews reported similar problems.

Title: Great laptop!  ASUS its an amazing brand!
Content:
This is the second Asus in my my family, and i have to recognized this brand rocks, great prices, great battery life, not as at advertised, but using wifi, for email purposes, around 9 hours.
No hassles with the keyboard, mouse or anyuthing, even so i can give you the advice that after you remove the sticker in the mouse, you must clean it with a moistured pad.So it will run more smoodly. 
Dont think it twice this is a Best-Buy. 
Pros:Really Slim, Amazing battery life, Nice Display, ultrafast booting, 8 sec system to browse, music, skype,etc..!
The only Cons: Its hard to keep it without fingerprints because of their finish.

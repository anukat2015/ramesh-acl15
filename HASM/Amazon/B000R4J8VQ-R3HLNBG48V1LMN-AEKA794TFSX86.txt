Title: Nice idea but.....
Content:
This is a nice idea but not worth it.  It stopped working after the third use, however, KUDOS to Hamilton Beach - they replaced it without any problem.  Item is large and takes up more counter space than I would like.  I made coffee with it but the clean up is not worth using it for that. Even after getting the replacement, it now sits in my garage. I strongly suggest buying the Sunbeam HotShot, which works faster, is small and attractive and is a much better value. I actually had an older model and wound up replacing it with the newer model- should have done that first.  Do check it out and consider it.

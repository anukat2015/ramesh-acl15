Title: Feature-packed camera for a great price
Content:
I had two Pentax film SLR's for over twenty years, and then came compact digital cameras. I was waiting for a reasonably priced DSLR to move up to. The Pentax K200D fit the bill.
I am able to use my three film SLR Pentax lenses on this camera - no other manufacturer supports their film lenses on their DSLR (except for the very expensive full-frame cameras). 
The features are great and plentiful - too many to mention. And I do not miss the "live view" capability at all (framing your shot on the lcd display), as I am very happy and comfortable using the viewfinder to frame my shots and see the camera's settings.
There is some controversy around loss of detail using the built-in JPEG engine which is wonderfully reviewed at [...]  I confirmed this loss of detail shooting my dog's hair. As the review points out, if you want all the detail, shoot in RAW and be happy. I also set the camera to use use the Normal setting and contrast/hue/sharpness at 0. 
I have owned this camera for over four months now, shooting a couple of thousand pictures, indoors and out, landscapes and portraits, parties, the moon and snapshots.  I use Picasa for managing my photos (it supports Pentax RAW). I used auto-bracketing, consecutive exposures, shutter priority, aperture priority, ISO priority, manual and automatic. This camera is a blast to hold and to use.
Bottom line, for a little more than $500, you get a camera that will make any amateur photographer happy. For that price point, I think this is the only camera worth considering.

Title: My Camera hangs when trying to transfer the pictures
Content:
Hi,
    I love the pictures this produces but the transfer hangs when connecting the cmaera to the computer. I have updated the fireware, tried different cards and I have 3 computers; it does the same thing with all of them etc I am using a 16gb extreme iv card from sandisk and that works fine in a media card reader. Anyone else seen this issue?

Title: Great vacuum
Content:
This vacuum has a lot of suction.  It's light and easy to use.  I loaned it to a friend and she liked it so well that she is going to order one for herself.  Time will tell how well the vacuum will hold up but right now I am very happy with my purchase.  I have always used Electrolux vacuum's but I am used to paying a lot more money.  I like the price of this one a lot.

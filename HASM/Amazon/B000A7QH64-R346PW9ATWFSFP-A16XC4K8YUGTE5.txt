Title: Disappointed
Content:
I bought this vacuum from the store after I lost my previous hand vac in a move. (the previous one was a different model and worked really well) After owning this vacuum for about a month I have already trashed it. I could not get this vacuum to pick up even the little stuff. I've actually had to bend down and stuff small items into the vacuum. Also, unless I hold it at just the right angle to the floor it won't pick up anything. I have only been using it on hardwood though, so perhaps it works better for carpet. It just didn't work for me.

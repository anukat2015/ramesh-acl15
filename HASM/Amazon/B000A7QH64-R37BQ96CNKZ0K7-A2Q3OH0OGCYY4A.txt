Title: A TOTAL waste of money.
Content:
I bought this vacuum despite the reviews that it didn't hold a charge figuring that the people who wrote those reviews didn't follow the directions explicitly.  Well, I was wrong. I followed the directions completely and this vacuum does not hold a charge at all.  I couldn't vacuum a 2 sq foot area before the battery drains.  It also kicks out a fair amount of dust when turned on.   The only positive is that it looks cool.  If you want an ornamental vacuum that doesn't work at all, then this is a good product. Otherwise it is a complete waste of money.

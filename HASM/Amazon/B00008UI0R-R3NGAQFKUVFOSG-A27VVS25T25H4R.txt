Title: super sucker-upper!
Content:
I researched vacuums for a long time before deciding on this model.  I wanted to switch from an upright to a canister because I have neck/upper back problems and thought pushing around something lighter might help (it has).  Besides helping out my back, this machine performed better than anything I have ever used before.  It does a super job!  I recommend this model nased on: ease of use (all switches are on the handle), lightweight, POWER!!!, and ease of maintenance.  the only drawback as far as I am concerned is that 2 of the additional tools that are sent with the vac aren't stored on-board, you might be making trips to your cleaning closet.  This is a great product.

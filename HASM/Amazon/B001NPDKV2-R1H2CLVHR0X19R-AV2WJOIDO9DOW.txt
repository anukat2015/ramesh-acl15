Title: Well priced laptop until the HD dies on you
Content:
I bought this laptop in April and was very happy with the price and the product (aside from the relatively short battery life).  What I was not prepared for was for the hard drive to die after 6 months causing me to lose all my data and pictures (which I foolishly had not backed up).  Interestingly enough, a co-worker in my office had purchased the same exact computer and his hard drive died after 9 months.  Now, not only have I lost all my data but I will need to figure out how to remove the existent HD and install the new one that they are sending me (which I will have to pay someone to do).  End of the day, this "budge" purchase will end up costing me a lot more then the original $400.

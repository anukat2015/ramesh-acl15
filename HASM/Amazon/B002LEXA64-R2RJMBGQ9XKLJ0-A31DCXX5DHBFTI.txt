Title: Good alternative to 10.1" netbooks (too small) and larger heavier laptops
Content:
I am happy with my Acer AS 1410. The only things I wished for would be that it would run a little faster (better chip) and that Amazon would offer clients to choose XP. I don't like Vista and Windows 7 would mean trouble with periferals such as printers, scanners etc. 
The pros are a strong wireless atenna, great in-built camera, small practical size and great battery life (trade off for 6 cell batteries is that it's a little more heavy). The larger screen and keyboard make it easy to use for someone my age (over 50). Also, the AC adapter is very small and light weight. 
I recommend this nifty little computer for anyone who looks for something in between tiny netbooks and larger laptops.

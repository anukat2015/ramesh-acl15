Title: Actually made my room warmer.
Content:
My husband and I bought this portable unit for a good price to assist in cooling our furnished and well insulated attic.  We have a small window unit in place, but since temps have risen over 90 degrees it was not quite doing the job.  When we hooked up this portable unit, it did not make the attic any cooler- in fact it increased the temperature!  We ran the unit all day, thinking maybe it needed time to cool the air.  The temperature in the attic never got below 90 degrees.  We just turned it off about 15 minutes ago, and already the temperature has dropped.  It does not have good cool air output (weak fan), and the exhaust hose produces so much heat that it seems to countereffect what little cool air it does put out. Please save yourself the headache of hauling this heavy thing into your house only to be disappointed.  Buy something else.

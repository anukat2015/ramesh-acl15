Title: Great Device, cheap and worth the deal!
Content:
This is a great buy, the cost is great, and sound and everything is just as great as an iPod mini or Regular iPod.  It's light-weight capability benefits for athletes like me that like to work out a lot and its sleek design will make people stare in envy at it.  It doesn't have an LCD screen, but who cares?  It's very simple to put the songs onto it too.  You just plug the iPod into the optional USB port or the extension cable that comes with it and an iPod symbol will appear on your iTunes at the left.  Then just go to the library and drag the songs over.  Could it get any easier?  But i definately recommend buying a sports case for it.  It adds color and protects it efficiently at the same time.  Overall, this is a must-have for someone that can't afford the outrageous price for an iPod mini or Regular iPod or for someone who is just looking for a good light-weight deal.

Title: Didn't last as long as the battery!
Content:
My husband lost his laptop when he lost his job so I wanted to get him a replacement for Christmas.  His previous one was an HP and he had several issues with it; I'd also talked to others who were less than happy with their HP's (what happened to them, anyway?).  I've had a Toshiba for a number of years and it's been very reliable so I decided on the T135-S1307.  My husband likes to take a laptop with him when he travels so the smaller, lighter one with the long battery life seemed like a good choice.
There were three negatives I'd read about - the speakers, the touch pad, and the fingerprints.  One of the reviewers provided a solution for the speakers; the touch pad wasn't really an issue when we gave it a try. And who cares about fingerprints, right?  I have to say, I did - they were bad.  The keyboard was small and with him being a fairly big guy, that and the smaller screen were going to take some getting used to but he was excited about his new toy.  Day 2 - it wouldn't turn on.  We tried everything to no avail - so it went back to Amazon and we headed for the store.  He's EXTREMELY happy with the replacement - a Sony Vaio.  When I'm ready to replace my Toshiba (which will be soon), I will likely get one too.

Title: another great canon digi cam
Content:
this is the 7th or 8th (lost count after awhile) canon camera i've owned and it's about the best.  perfectly-sized (not too small nor too big) w/easy to understand controls - nice history here going back to my 35 slr film cameras.  the 2.5 lcd screen works well and it's fairly fast for reviewing pix compared to my earlier 6.3 meg rebel eos body.
kudos again to canon.

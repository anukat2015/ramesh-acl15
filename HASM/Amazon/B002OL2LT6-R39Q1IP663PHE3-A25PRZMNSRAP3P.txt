Title: Malfunction of cursor
Content:
I purchased this computer last November, and had problem with cursor.
The cursor was moving around randomly everywhere inside of screen, so when you type, all of sudden it was typing somewhere else. I returned it and Amazon sent me another Toshiba, which was doing the exact same thing. I called Toshiba tech support many times, who had no idea what to do except to send it for repair or reload all window programs from the scratch. I returned the second one and bought Sony which is working fine.

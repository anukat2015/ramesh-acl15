Title: Incredible notebook value
Content:
I just picked up this machine from the MS Store for an incredible $458; 4 GB RAM, 320 HDD, Win 7. (The price has now gone up to $650 )
I've mostly used Dells in the past, and was looking for a replacement for my X1 (which I love, but the battery is shot, and even a refurbished replacement is around $200 because the machine is from 2005). That notebook was around 3lbs, so I wanted something light, but with a full size keyboard, wrist rest, and a slightly larger screen (the X1 was 12")
I could not be happier with the Acer. The screen is truly incredible, like watching a high def TV. I would prefer two buttons on the trackpad (as the X1 had) but I am getting used to the single button. The display-mounted wireless antenna is a great plus, and the reception seems excellent.
In terms of performance, I'm coming from a an XP machine that had just 1 GB of RAM, so naturally virtually any new computer will seem fast, but the Acer is an excellent performer. I like Win 7 thus far.
The machine just feels amazingly solid and well made for the price. I honestly don't know how they make money with a price this low. Also, some have commented on the sound from the speakers. I think it's fine. With headphones though, it's great. The fan is very quiet and the battery life thus far is very, very good. Minimum 5 hours, and I've gotten more, though I've not tried playing a full movie yet. Oh,and yes, the keyboard shows fingerprints. Big deal, just wipe it off. The chicklet keys also take some adjustment but I'm getting used to them.
Would I like a SLIGHTLY lighter machine? Yes. I was considering the Toshiba Satellite T135D-S1326 13.3-inch Notebook that was under 4lbs, but it was more money. And what one reviewer said it true: you really don't need the power brick, except perhaps if you're playing DVDs or traveling. 
Considering I paid over $2000(!) for my Dell X1 in July 2005, the fact that I can get a notebook this good for under $500 is just amazing. Why anyone would pay $200 for a handcuffed netbook when they could get a machine like this is beyond me.

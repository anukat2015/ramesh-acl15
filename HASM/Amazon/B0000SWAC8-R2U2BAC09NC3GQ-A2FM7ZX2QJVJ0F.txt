Title: Piece of junk
Content:
I have owned this vacuum for over two years. Since I have bought it I have had to replace the drive belt 5 times (finally got a heavy duty version that did the trick) and replace 5 wand sections because the electrical connections burned out, and replaced the hose section once because the electrical connections melted, nearly causing a fire. This vacuum was poorly designed and replacement parts are not cheap. This is not your mother's Electrolux. Stay away.. stay very far away!

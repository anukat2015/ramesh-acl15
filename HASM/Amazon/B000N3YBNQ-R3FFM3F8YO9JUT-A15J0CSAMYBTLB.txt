Title: Wish I'd bought it a year ago!
Content:
I noticed this vacuum for sale about a year ago - mainly because of the pretty ingenious, apartment-closet-friendly design - but figured it couldn't be *that* much better than the one I was already using.  In the spirit of fiscal responsibility, I put it off.  Boy, was I wrong.
Y'know the other review, where the person talks about filling a bag on the first go?  You figure they must either be a reforming 'dirty person' or exaggerating.  It seems a stretch.  Whelp - I'm no 'dirty person' of any kind, and when I was through the living room and midway through the bedroom the 'change bag' light came on.  I sighed, figuring that the sensor was off, and tugged off the cover to check it.
Whaddaya know?  Full to the brim with stuff I had *no* idea had been hiding from my other vacuum.  Ew.
I went through one more bag.  I vacuumed three rooms.  You do the math.
My carpet looks pretty splendid this morning.  Needless to say, I'm pleased.  I never woulda thunk it,  but I wish I'd bought this thing when I first noticed it so the equivalent of the two bags of crud that went down the trash chute wouldn't be in my lungs right now.

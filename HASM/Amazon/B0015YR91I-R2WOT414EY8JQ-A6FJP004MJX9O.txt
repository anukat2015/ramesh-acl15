Title: Great features for price point but I've had serious reliability problems
Content:
The price per feature is without doubt the best on these micro-sized travel notebooks but the one I purchased is on its 2nd trip back to the factory for repair in just short of its year factory warranty (shipping to the factory was on my nickel both times no less). The first repair was for an issue where the machine got so hot that it completely fused the power cord onto the computer. 
I will definitely not be buying another Everex Stepnote (and I typically buy several notebooks a year for business). If I were for some reason to buy I would seriously consider purchasing an extended warranty. I have thus far had better durability, i.e. no factory returns, from similarly sized Toshiba's I have purchased. Although the Toshiba's cost $200 or more than the Everex.

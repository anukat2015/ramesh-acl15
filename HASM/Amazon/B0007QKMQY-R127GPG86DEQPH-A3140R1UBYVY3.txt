Title: A Great Camera
Content:
There are so many reviews in here already I can not add much. The camera is great buy it you will not be disappointed.  This camera has rekindled my intrest in photograpy I just can not seem to find enough free time to us it as much as I would like.  I thought my last camera had a fast shutter speed a Konica Minolta Dimage Z3 but the Canon Rebel xt much much faster. The only negative I have is there a to many accessories that I now want lenses, flash etc.  Bottom line buy this camera you will love it.

I bought two of these heaters; one for my office and one for the basement family room at home.  Awesome!  They work great, very effectively keeping me warm.  I especially like the feature that you can adjust the temperature so that it maintains the room temp turning itself on and off.  The only problem is that it works so well that the heat in the rest of my house doesn't come on because the house temp registers the warmth from this little heater.

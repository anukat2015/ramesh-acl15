Title: FANTASTIC!!!!
Content:
We absolutely LOVE this vacuum!!  I'm baffled by some of the negative reviews.  Maybe those people got a lemon??  Ours works amazingly well.  It has incredible suction, and picks up debris, hair, and dust like nobody's business.  The debris container needs to be cleaned regularly (I usually empty it twice each time I vacuum my 2500 sf. home), but wow!  I can never believe how much stuff I get off my floors EVERY time I vacuum!  I vacuum my entire house every single week...  and spot vac regularly throughout each week.  So far, no brush spinning / suction problems whatsoever.  Just make sure you keep the debris canister cleaned.  My neighbor borrowed it when she was moving, and couldn't rave about it enough!  She wants to go buy one for herself!

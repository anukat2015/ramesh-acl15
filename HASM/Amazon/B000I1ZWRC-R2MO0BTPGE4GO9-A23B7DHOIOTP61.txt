Title: I love this. This is wonderful
Content:
This is my first SLR camera. I switched from Point and shoot canon powershot sd450. Since I am not professional photographer, I don't want to shed more money. I searched all over the internet last week for a best Digital SLR camera. At last I selected Canon Digital Rebel Xti. I am very satisfied with this camera. It is too good. Picture quality is very good. I bought 75-300mm III USM Lens along with this. My first picture with this lens is Moon. WOW it came very good. I would definitely recommend this to any one who wants to switch from Point and Shoot.

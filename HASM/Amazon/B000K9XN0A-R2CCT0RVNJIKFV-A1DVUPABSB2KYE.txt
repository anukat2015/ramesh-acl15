Title: Hot coffee many hours later, no burned taste.
Content:
Very impressed. Good tasting coffee that stays steaming hot 8 hours later. We bring the carafe and Sunday newspaper to the upstairs master bedroom and enjoy coffee and crosswords for hours. No problems with spills from misaligned baskets and carafes. Also looks great in the new kitchen.

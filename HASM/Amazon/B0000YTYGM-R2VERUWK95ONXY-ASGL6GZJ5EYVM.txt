Title: A mix of nice features and poor design
Content:
It's very nice that the carafe keeps coffee hot without needing a hotplate. I imagine this saves a lot of electricity over the course of a year for people who like to keep their coffee hot for a couple hours.
But there are drawbacks that make this coffee maker annoying. You should know:
1) The handle is uncomfortable
2) The spout doesn't "pour" as much as it "trickles." That wouldn't be as big a deal if the handle were more comfortable to hold.
3) This is obvious, but it's more annoying than I thought it would be: the carafe is opaque so you have no idea how much coffee is left in it. And the carafe itself has some weight to it, so it's hard to tell by just picking it up. The only solution is to serve some coffee and find out if there's enough to fill a mug.
I haven't had the problem of the machine making a mess as other people have. I find the lid easy to screw on properly.

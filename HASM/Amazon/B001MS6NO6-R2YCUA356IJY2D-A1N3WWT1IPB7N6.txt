Title: Excellent PC replacment
Content:
As others have stated, the Vaio VGN-FW373J/B is a great laptop.  Features like the crystal clear hi-def screen, easy to use MacBook-esque keyboard, full 10 key pad, excellent audio performance and many other media features should wow the typical computer user.
In our case, we bought the Vaio last December as a replacement for my wife's HP Pavillion laptop which served as the household's primary computer over our wifi network.  The Vaio boots up faster, turns off faster and is just loads more powerful than the HP we had.  The HP was fine for a couple years, but started to bog down and the power cord had a nagging problem of not working correctly for a few years that finally pushed us to upgrade.
There are better technical reviews of this laptop from other users here, so please feel free to read them carefully.  But for the typical home user who needs, or wants, to replace their desktop PC or just replace their media based laptop, this Vaio fits the bill perfectly.

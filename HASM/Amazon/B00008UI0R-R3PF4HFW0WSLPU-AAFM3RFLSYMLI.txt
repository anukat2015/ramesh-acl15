Title: Too bad I couldn't give it a 10....
Content:
A most impressive unit - especially for the price...  As the owner of a first generation Eureka bagless upright, which was relegated  to the closet in favor of an OLD Hoover cannister with the power head, I have to say Hoover has done it again...
The variable suction is an excellent feature, the ease of emptying the cannister, and the location and ease of cleaning the hepa filter are major pluses as well... Then there's the revolving brush small head - (it is powered by the air flow, it does not plug in like the floor head.) great on pet hair on "their" favorite couch...
As good as I thought the OLD Hoover was, I was genuinely amazed at how much more "stuff" this one picked up in the same amount of time...  It even ripped through a spilled bowl of popcorn, without batting an eye.
If this one turns up in the Friday Sale again, or elsewhere at a reduced price, treat yourself...

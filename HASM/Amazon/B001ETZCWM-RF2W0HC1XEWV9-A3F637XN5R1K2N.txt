Title: 3 Q HEATER
Content:
I BOUGHT THIS ITEM DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER. IT WORKED WELL FOR ONE WEEK
AND THEN IT KEPT SWITCHING ITSELF OFF EVERY 3 MINUTES. I CONTACTED THE VENDOR THREE TIMES EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS BEING ENCOUNTERED AND REQUESTING A RETURN AUTHORIZATION NUMBER. IT HAS TAKEN ABOUT THREE WEEKS TO OBTAIN THE AUTHORIZATION NUMBER AND NOW THEY INFORM ME THAT THE ITEM NEEDS TO BE RETURNED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE OURCHASE DATE.

Title: Good but then...
Content:
Impressed when I first used it. But the first problem was replacing the motor belt-the burn out very fast if you hit a sock or rug fringe. The only place I could get the belts was from the company's website at the cost of $15 for one! I mean they cost 10cents right? I've gone through five belts in ten months.
When the vac clogs it is really difficult to remove. We are talking two hours if the clog is in the wrong place. Finally, after five hours of trying to remove a clog from deep inside the head I gave up-against recommendations I used coat hangers, but its so awkward to get at and remove clogs theres no alternative. I tried Shark customer service and warranty but to return the vac and be without one for several weeks is not possible.
When it worked it worked well BUT it is messy to empty and needs emptying every few minutes. The tools are not much use and the extendable wand bit broke early on. It cost $200-plus $60 in replacement belts and I regret ever buying it. It was messy when it worked, troublesome when it clogged and the belts broke. My advice is, if you want this type of vac-cyclone, bagless then get the Dysons. It is more money now but the get what you pay for. The Shark Infinity is a cheaper, inferior version!

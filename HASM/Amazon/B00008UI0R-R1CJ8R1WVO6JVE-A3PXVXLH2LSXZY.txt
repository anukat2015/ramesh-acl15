Title: DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!
Content:
CHANGE STAR RATING TO MINUS 1!!!!I bought this vacuum in Jan. 2007.  I have 2 cats, so needed something with good suction.  It is great at cleaning, but now it seems to be shorting out if I try to use it with carpet mode on.  Hose also tends to start kinking in funny ways and can be cumbersome while vacuuming.  Has anyone else had any of these issues.  I wouldn't have expected problems this soon in ownership.  UPDATE TO PREVIOUS REVIEW!!!At just about 7 months of ownership the light went out and it has been downhill ever since!  I researched a while before buying based on the positive reviews.  After owning an Oreck, which was a piece of junk, I looked for something that could really get up the pet hair of 2 cats.  The suction was great from day 1 on this vacuum, although I found it a bit cumbersome to use.  I constantly was emptying the canister and cleaning filter, but I attributed that to the pet hair.  Just after a year ownership the brush worked intermittently and sometimes I couldn't turn it off without unplugging it.  This evolved to the brush only working if handle was completely parallel to floor ( this worked by vacuuming in a sitting position on floor, thus my shoulder and elbow pain).  This morning it all went up in smoke (literally) as I tried to vacuum my living room.  It is now sitting on the front porch ready for the garbage pick-up.  Even my crappy Oreck lasted at least a little longer.  If this is Hoover's quality, I'll pass on it from now on!

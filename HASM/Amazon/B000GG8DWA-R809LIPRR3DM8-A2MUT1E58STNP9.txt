Title: Good for small rooms
Content:
This is a good little heater IF you are only using it in a small room for directional heating.  It has no fan, so it is so quiet you don't know it is running.  Even at 800 watts, it does not put out a lot of heat; but it supplements a central heating system well when the thermostate is in another part of the house.  But it's not for heavy-duty heating in extremely cold weather.

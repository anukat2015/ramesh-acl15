I love this camera!!!! I bought a Nikon all manual camera when I was in the service overseas and back some years sold the camera to get a video camera!!! Big mistake! I looked for a new manual film recently and decided to go digital. That was my best decision. I researched all the digital cameras and compared price and features and I decided on the olympus. This was an even bigger good decision. The camera is fast, no lag time for shutter to actually take the picture. I love the rapid multi picture feature. It snaps pics one after another with no lag time!!!! I love it! The most important feature is the picture itself, they are very sharp and excellent detail in macro mode. I take pics of flowers close up and they look like pictures in photography magazines. I looked at the nikon D40 and thought this was a better camera. The lens is excellent!!!
You can't go wrong with this camera. i did manual film for years and this is so much better and has the ability to do all manual if you like. The menus are very good. I love the camera!!!!!

Title: can't find filters for the SV736K
Content:
This product seems to work fine. I like it that way. However, the manual recommends replacing the filter every 3 months.  This is frequent and would be expensive.  I can't seem to find the exact filter for the SV736K.  After searching on line, I called the company. Customer service seemed odd. They insisted on a detailed name and address before they could tell me whether or not they had a filter.  It took so long, I didn't hang on. I can't really recommend the product due to bad support.

Title: Zune Zune Zune
Content:
I like the Zune 80.  I wanted to let some of you know (I've read a lot of complaints about it not completely shutting down) that if you hold the center touch pad toward the down position while holding down the "back" button, it will shut off the Zune so it doesn't drain your battery.  
It's useful if you have a video that freezes the processor for some reason. 
I know someone will think that was useful information.

Title: Lightweight and easy to maneuver
Content:
This vacuum has great suction,  is lightweight and easy to maneuver. There are two things I don't like, however. The first, is that the opening for the floor attachment is too narrow. Any little scrap of paper or plastic or pet food clogs it up. Pet hair just makes it clog up that much faster. The first time I used it, I had to stop every minute or so to clear the opening. Now, before I vacuum I manually remove anything on the floor big enough to pick up. The second problem is that it really is messy to empty out the cup that holds the dirt. The filter sits in the middle, so dirt gets imbeded in its folds. When you do clean the filter, take it outside and avoid doorways, or you will track everything back inside.

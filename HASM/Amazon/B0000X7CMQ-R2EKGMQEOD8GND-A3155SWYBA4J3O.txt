Title: Design flaws
Content:
This is a very interesting design.  It is basically a thermos.  Water is pumped through a coffee filter into a thermos; the heating element immediately turns off when brew is completed. You cap the thermos and the coffee stays hot to very warm for many hours.  You can set the carafe anywhere on the counter because it is cool to the touch.  You don't have to reset it in the machine.  This is convenient.
I like fresh coffee - not coffee that has stewed on a warming element for hours and this product provides that fresh taste.  
There was two areas the designers should look at:  1) the filter basket uses a #4 paper filter.  The paper filter sticks up about 1/8 inch above the top of the basket.  When you add 10 scoops of coffee there really is not enough room.  The filter basket should be larger.  You have to shake and work with the the filter to settle it into the basket.  This can cause the water hose arm to drag on the filter.  It has never not worked but is something you have to deal with each time you make coffee.
#2 the screw down cap works like a vacuum suction.  To keep the coffee warm you have to tighten the cap and when you are ready to pour the coffee you loosen the cap.  The tighter the cap the harder it is to loosen.  But if you don't tighten it down the coffee loses heat.
I looked several months for a new coffee maker and so far am pleased with the product.  I do not know of a coffee maker I would rather have at this time.

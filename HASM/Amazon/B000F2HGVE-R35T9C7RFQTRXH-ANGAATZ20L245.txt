Title: True about all the bad comments!
Content:
I received one of these and it's true about the leaking on the counter.  I just thought I spilled some water the first few times but then i dried up the bottom after filling it and still had leakage.  This is poorly made.  Also, I accidentally broke the carafe (which is very thinly made and more delicate than other glass carafes I've had from past machines).  So I called Delonghi to get a replacement....they quoted me $45 for a new carafe!  Totally bad item all the way around.

Title: Great
Content:
This Heater is Great ! it heats up my room and keeps it worm in less than 10 mins,, but i don't think it would work on a big and open spaced room such as the living room ; however it really helped me through this winter and it also can work as a fan and now i'm using it in the summer although it doesn't do very good in cooling so as summer gets hotter i'm probably buying a bigger fan.
Get this if ur room isn't really big and u need a heater.

Title: works great
Content:
We purchased this air conditioner for our 3rd floor bedrooms--we have casement windows in one room and only a sliding glass door in another .  Like other reviewers I found the installation perplexing but I finally went to a local plastic company who made me custom clear plastic inserts -- took my screen from the window and they made the plastic the size of the screen with a hole cut out for the vent.  For the sliding doors the insert was made about 7 inches wide and the length of the door.  Both inserts work well. As far as the unit we are very happy as they cool the room quite comfortably.  I have emptied the drain once a week for about a month now and I've never gotten more then 1 cup of of water if that.  My only complaint is that it is rather noisy but not much more then a regular room air conditioner.  Since we are not home much during the day we rarely turn on the central air--just use the portables for sleeping--has cut down our electric bill dramatically.  Overall very happy with this

Title: DeLonghi TRH0715
Content:
As my wife and I are perfectionistic designers, sifting through the vast variety of the space heaters available on the market was some task.  We finally decided on one which would provide a slow constant wamth versus the hot air bast-types such as heat fan elements, coil heaters, etc. resting on the idea of purchasing a radiated type. We read the reports on DeLonghi products in general which overall had been favorable. We made the decision to purchase the non-timer version of the TRH0715T, the TRH0715. Although slighlty less expensive, in hind sight I think we would've spent the extra money and got the timer version. We have still to recieve our electricity bill, but guess it much more economical than slappiing down $1,500 for heating oil. The two we purchased, heat our main floor nicely (1,300 sq. ft.), and is not too inconvient when moving heaters from room to room if/when necessary. The overall design is thoughtfully provided in the form of a stealth high-heat resistant plastic handle, 4 castor-roller type wheels, a cord wrap attachement, and aerodynamic heating fins. The heat is slow and constant and does not get "burning hot" like coil-element heaters (I still don't suggest touching it however). This was a good purchase and we feel very good about the price we paid. If you're looking for a non-avant garde designed heater which provides a good steady soft heat, this is the one!

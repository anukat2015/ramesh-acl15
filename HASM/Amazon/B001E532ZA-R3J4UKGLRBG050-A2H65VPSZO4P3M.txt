Title: Love It So Far!
Content:
The reason that I chose this machine over the Keurig is that the Tassimo makes Lattes and Cappuccinos.  It doesn't seem like the Keurig machine does this.  Anyway, I absolutely LOVE it.  I was a manager at a Starbucks for a few years so I would like to think that I know good coffee.  And this coffee is very good.  The lattes taste like lattes.  No, it doesn't have as much foam as you would get from a coffee shop cup, but there is some foam, and the milk and espresso tastes great!  It does NOT taste like coffee with milk, it DOES taste like a latte.  So I am very satisfied with this.  It is extremely quiet, and a full tank of water lasts for 6 or so cups, so you don't have to refill it every morning.  A cup of coffe brews in about 20 seconds, a latte or cappuccino about a minute.
The ONLY downside to this machine compared to the Keurig is the T-disks are not as readily available as the K-cups in the stores around me.  Target and Bed Bath and Beyond will have coffee and latte t-disks to choose from, but I can't find the tea or hot chocolate in any store around me.  So I will probably have to end up ordering these things online which is annoying.  Other than this, I absolutely love it!

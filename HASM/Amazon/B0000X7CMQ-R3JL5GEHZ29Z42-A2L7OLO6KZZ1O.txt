Title: overflow and underheat
Content:
i guess these coffee makers are luck of the draw because the one i got seems to overflow 50% of the time and the coffee doesnt stay hot.  this is NOT for people who want to set the pot and forget about it because if it overflows it just keeps going.  the filters have to be packed down dilligently as the lip of the filter tends to be pushed down by the how water arm as it swings across the top.  this ofcourse tends to make it overflow. 
i would not buy this again

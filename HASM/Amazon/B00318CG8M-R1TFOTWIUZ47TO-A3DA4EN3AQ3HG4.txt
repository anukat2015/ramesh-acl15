Title: Great machine for the price
Content:
I was looking for a powerful netbook because the 10.1" netbooks out there are just too slow and too small.  I bought (then returned) the ASUS EEE 1201N, a 12" netbook with almost the same incredible specs, and for almost the same price, as this HP DM3-1130US.  
The following are what influenced me to switch to this DM3-1130US from the 1201N: 64-bit AMD processor vs. 32-bit Intel.  4 GB RAM vs. 2 GB RAM, 320 GB 7200 RPM drive vs. 250 GB 5400 RPM drive, brushed aluminum case vs. finger-print magnet plastic case, 5-in-1 card reader vs. 2-in-1 card reader, 4 USB ports vs. 3 USB ports, chrome track pad vs. dimpled track pad.  And finally, a $50 rebate from HP that makes it cheaper than the ASUS netbook.
I did lose a few things I can live without: the 1080P full HD capability when connected to external monitor/HDTV, the flushed track pad that allows no dust in the cracks, the portability of 12" vs. 13" - but I could see more.
Otherwise, both machines have incredible features for the price.  This is not to say ASUS EEE 1201N is a bad machine.  It's not.  Both machines are top of the lines.  The HP DM3-1130US gives better value for less money at this time.

Title: Dyson DC11 Telescope
Content:
I like this product very much and I have also owned the yellow Dyson DC07. I use it mainly on the first floor of our home that has hardwood floors, area rugs, and ceramic tile. I like the compactness of it and the way it stores. I tested this on the oriental rugs and compared it with the DC07; I was skeptical that the smaller brush head on the DC11 Telescope would work as well. I was happy to note it was great, got rid of all the carpet dust crud (must be the dog). The wand handle is easier to use and it gets underneath low tables, chairs, etc that the DC07 cannot reach. For a smaller home, with a variety of floor types, it's awesome. If you have large, wall to wall carpet, it could get tedious because the brush head seems to be at least two inches shorter. For my home, it's working well I'm loving it and it's fun to use. It does a much better job sucking up the long hairs that always wrap around the DC07. Somehow, this one sucks it up much better and puts those long hairs right into the bin. Each time after using the DC07, I had to cut off all the long hairs that got trapped around the beater bar; with the DC11, I don't have to do this.

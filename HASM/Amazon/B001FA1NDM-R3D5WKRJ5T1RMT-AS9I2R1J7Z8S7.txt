Title: ipod nano rocks!
Content:
I got this ipod nano today for christmas. I enjoy this ipod very much. It has great color, screen is hard to scratch, and fit very well into my pocket. I was reading some one star reviews before I got this. Some people say that from the slightest movement it will shuffle to a random song. They are wrong. Two things are that, if you do not want it to do that, you can go to the settings and turn it off. Second, you can put it on hold and it wont shuffle. Another thing I disagree with  is some people are disappointed that the new nano wont go on the old charger. The ipod comes with a whole new charger and a plastic little dock. Why use old accessories when you can use a the brand new one it comes with. I think the new nano 4g deserves five stars

Title: Gateway a winner
Content:
Best laptop I have owned so far.  Good tactile feel in the keyboard, with generous key size and logical layout....except the tiny delete key which is just another function key; needs to be better placed and easier to identify.  That said, I find no other complaints.  Build quality is terrific and runs flawlessly so far (one month of daily use).  One feature that is really nice is the on/off button for the touchpad.  I use a mouse most of the time, so this prevents unexpected cursor movements while typing.  The brushed aluminum cover is a nice touch in styling, and despite the thin profile, battery life is as advertised, about 7 hours with average use of web browsing and typing.  I do not use spreadsheets or other graphically intensive programs, however.  One other minor issue would be the lack of regular mini jack for your powered laptop speakers.  If they are just USB connected, no problem, but the HDMI connection takes the place of output minijack for sound, and I have not found any laptop speakers with HDMI input.

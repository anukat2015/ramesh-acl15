Title: I love it
Content:
I flew to Las Vegas for my birthday. I didn"t know they charge for the headphones to listen to the movie. So I took out my Ipod,my so ha put some movies on it for me, and watched my own movies free. I listened to music on the way to the hotel. I think the Ipod is just great.

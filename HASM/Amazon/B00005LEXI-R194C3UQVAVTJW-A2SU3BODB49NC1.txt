Title: Wow, people have strong feelings about a simple appliance here!
Content:
A great little heater.  Running it 10 minutes on and 20 minutes off on low makes my VW van toasty warm on a windy, 15 degree day.
The only problem for my purposes is the condensation - it generates a lot of water vapor during operation.
You'd be up for a Darwin Award if you managed to injure yourself with this thing, assuming you know enough not to touch a fire.
There's a low-oxygen shutoff, a tip/shake shutoff, and several other safety features, plus detailed safety instructions.
Someone wrote that there is "no mention of a filter in the owner's manual", but there is in mine.  It says that if you use the unit with bulk propane, it "must" only be done with their official connector dongle and filter.  They go on to specify that the filter should be replaced yearly.

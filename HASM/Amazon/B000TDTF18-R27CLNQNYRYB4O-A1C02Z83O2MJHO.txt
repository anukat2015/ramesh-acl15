Title: Great Design!
Content:
We decided to replace our $100 Kitchen Aid coffee maker with this model because our old one had serious design flaws and was starting to fall apart after less than a year.  This appliance has a unique design that allows you to fill the coffee grounds and water without having to pull the machine out from under your low hung cabinets.  This was always a problem with other brands we had.  I love the pull out design!  Secondly, it doesn't beep when it's done brewing, which if you have sleeping babies is a good thing.  The sleek design, unique features and intuitive programing makes this worth the money.  Good buy!

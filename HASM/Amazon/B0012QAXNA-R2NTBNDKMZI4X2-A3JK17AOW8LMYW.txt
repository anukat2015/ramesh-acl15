Title: AA Battery DSLR
Content:
Pentax is the only company that currently manufactures AA battery powered DSLR's. If you don't like to charge batteries then this is an advantage. Pentax recommends Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries as these have more juice. You can use Alkaline AA batteries however they won't last as long as the Lithium AA batteries. Let's say you are at a museum, zoo, sporting event etc and you discover your Digital camera is out of power, if you have a rechargeable battery there's nothing you can do you won't be able to take photos, now let's say the same thing happens with the Pentax K200D, well all you have to do is go to the gift shop and buy some AA batteries and you're ready to shoot.
Another advantage of the pentax is that you can use manual focus k-mount lenses from 1975 onward with the Pentax DSLRs.(there are limitations, see the manual for more details)
The build quality is excellent for this camera it has weather sealing to protect it from moisture and dust, it also has a top LCD display features usually not seen on a camera in this price range.

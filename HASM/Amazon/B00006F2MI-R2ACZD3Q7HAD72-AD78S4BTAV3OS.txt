Title: Piece of Junk
Content:
First, Cuisinart products are made in China these days, and it shows in all of them.  As for this coffee maker, it is so badly designed, it's barely functional.
*The water reservoir is a step-down design which is hard to read because you can't really tell where the water level is - keep a flashlight handy.  If you only want to make 3 cups, good luck.  It's like looking down a well.
*The grinder is startlingly loud - very unpleasant to wake up to.  Even if you steel yourself for the noise, it's still shocking.
*Steam builds up in the grinder, and it gets gummy and nasty.
* It's a pain to clean
* The coffee is weak and lukewarm.  The grinder is not big enough to hold the proper amount of beans for 10 cups of coffee.
I hate this machine.  It would give me great satisfaction to beat it to bits with a baseball bat.

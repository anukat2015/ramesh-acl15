Title: Worth every penny
Content:
I bought the ASUS UL30A-A1 on October 2 and have used it daily for work since then.  I am a consultant so I needed something light and powerful going back and forth to my client's place of business.  I was a little reluctant since my previous computer brands were IBM and Dell and never heard of ASUS.  So far it has been great...I love the feel of the keyboard and got used to the mousepad rather quickly.  The mouse pad is sensitive so I do find, while typing, my thumb will inadvertantly graze the mousepad causing the curser to move elsewhere in the document.  Easily solveable with an external mouse. It is so lightweight that I just throw it in my briefcase, leave the powercord at home (becuase the battery lasts all day) and I'm on my way.  Also, the boot up time is very, very quick.

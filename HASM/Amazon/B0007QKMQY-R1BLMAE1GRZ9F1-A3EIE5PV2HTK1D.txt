Title: Excellent Pictures
Content:
Review in April 2006
I upgraded from Powershot G2 and very happy with the results. This is my first SLR camera so I have a lot to learn on using different features this camera offers but the so far the family pictures taken indoors are excellent. I can see a big difference in quality over G2. 
I read a lot of user reviews about this camera and I chose not to get the kit lens as suggested by many reviews at various sites. I got 50MM and 28-135 IS lenses to go with it and planning to get a 100-300 IS in the future to complete the set. Very Happy!

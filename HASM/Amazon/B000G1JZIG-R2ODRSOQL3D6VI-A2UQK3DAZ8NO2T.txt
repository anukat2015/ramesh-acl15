Title: Very nice value...is stabalizer worth $100?
Content:
Looking for your first digital SLR?  The K110D is a great beginning.  Solid construction, good image quality, and a very fine lens makes this your leader in the bargain SLR cameras.
All your standard features are here, from automatic to complete manual controls for both focus and exposure.  The solid build, and the additional weight of 4 AA batteries makes this one feel a bit tougher than the competition, and has a very comfortable grip in spite of the fact its one of the smaller bodies on the market.
The viewfinder is as good as any of it's competitor's, and the larger 2.5" LCD makes using the menu or reviewing photos simple.
The use of AA batteries is welcome by many, but the drawback is that they simply don't last as long as LithiumIon batteries on a charge.  Be sure to pick up some NiMh rechargable AA batteries to keep costs down.
The 18-55 is a real winner, best in its class by far.  It has internal focusing, with on demand manual focusing.  Build is above average, and includes a metal lens mount.  The supplied lens hood is very useful.
The only real consideration is whether or not to spend the extra $100 and get the K100D, which adds a built into body image stabalizer.  This is a great value for anyone interested in shooting available light photos.  With these two great value cameras, and the recently announced K10D (10 megapixels) and some serious "glass" (lenses), Pentax is truly a brand on the rise!

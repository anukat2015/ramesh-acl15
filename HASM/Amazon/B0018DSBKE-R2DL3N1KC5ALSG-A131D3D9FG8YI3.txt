Title: Powerful, but.....
Content:
I'm on my 3rd season with this unit.
1. Its way more powerful than my GE portable. Keeps the LR cool when the GE would not.
2. This unit, though powerful, is very poorly made.
Example: 
All four wheels broke off the first season (my season is June-Aug) 
The unit emits a "burnt tire" smell. finally stopped smelling in the 3rd season. Friends are no longer asking, "what's that smell?"
The digital lights went out at the start of the 2nd season, so no warranty to fix.
The directional blades fell off the machine  during the second season. Can not be repaired.
The exhaust hose lasted only one season, then fell apart, even though properly stored ($29 + s/h for replacement)
To all those who see nothing but good ratings at the Compact Appl site: They refuse to post any of the real negative stuff. They fix the comment section to reflect only good reviews of 4 stars and more. Not too ethical, no?

Title: Great Computer at a Great Price
Content:
I have been looking around for a replacement for my Dell Ispiron 6000 and looking at sites like tigerdirect as well as ebay and here.   No place, could match the laptop I bought from here.   This laptop is a MSI CX600 with 4GB ram and killer descrete video card.   It's one fast machine with plenty of RAM to run multiple virtual machines.  It can run 64bit OS and play games!   What a deal.  Most laptops with these specs go for at least 200-300 more.  There is something, that I wish it has, which is built in bluetooth.  This one doesnt come with it, but I dont use bluetooth anyway, on my laptops.    I placed the order online and recieved the laptop in about 7 days.  I turned in my free Windows 7 upgrade form, but still awaiting responce from the manufacturer. 
The battery life is about 2 hours on lowpower mode, surfing on wifi.  
My opinion, if your ready to upgrade your laptop, get this one and you'll have enough money left over to buysomething for your desktop.  good luck.

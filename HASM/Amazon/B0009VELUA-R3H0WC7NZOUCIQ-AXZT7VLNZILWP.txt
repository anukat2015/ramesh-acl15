Title: stopped working
Content:
I read the reviews about this item, but ignored the negative reviews and purchased it anyway.  Well, after several months it started leaking, just as others said it did.  A couple of months ago, another funky thing started happening.  I'd turn it on in the morning and it wouldn't go on.  I pulled the plug and moved it from outlet to outlet (above and below) and it started working.  (Everything else works just fine in these outlets, by the way.)  This routine happens every morning, now.  It RARELY goes on w/o me having to juggle the plug from outlet to outlet.  I have no idea why this happens, but it does.  I'm quite sure that one day,this won't even work!  I wouldn't buy this item again and I do not recommend this coffee maker.
I've emailed Cusinart about this a few times and NO ONE HAS GOTTEN BACK TO ME!  What poor customer service.
I'm quite sure that the people who wrote the good reviews will eventually have the same problems that most of us seem to have after a while.  Don't waste your money.  I'm now looking for a new coffee maker.

Title: Excellent value
Content:
I've had this vacuum cleaner for over a month now and on the whole, I'm pleased with it.  
1.  The dirt cup is small -- plan on emptying it out every time, especially if you have pets.  I like to do this outside into the compost pile to keep the dust out of the house.  On the other hand, a small cup makes it much easier to dig out the little screw that you've been looking for and saw just before the vacuum ate it.
2.  The little "powered" hand tool is excellent for getting cat fur off of upholstered furniture.  I put powered in quotes because the brush is spun by the suction, not electricity like the floor cleaner.
3.  This model, or at least the one that I got, does not come with a hard floor tool.  Now 95% of customers won't care because the powered carpet nozzle does an excellent job of vacuuming hardwood and vinyl floors.  However, my master suite is floored with slate.  It's beautiful, but the rough surface destroyed my Oreck upright.  I'd prefer to use a cheap floor tool that can be easily replaced.  Fortunately, new floor tools, along with belts and other parts can be purchased from Hoover's web site.

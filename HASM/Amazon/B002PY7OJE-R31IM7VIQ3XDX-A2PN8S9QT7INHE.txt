Title: Exceeds my expectations
Content:
Dell built a real winner.  Performs perfect!  A perfect balance of components.  Just the right amount of speed and fabulous battery life.  I've been shopping for Dell for a couple months now.  Amazon sealed the deal with this incredible price.  I love Amazon, and kudos to Dell.  I showed my employer this laptop last night and he bought one immediately.  I may pick up another one for my Mother.

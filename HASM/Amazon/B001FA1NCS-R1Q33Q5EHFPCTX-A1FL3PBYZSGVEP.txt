Title: not as thrilled as I should be
Content:
I was thrilled at first with this product, but soon discovered that when I use my laptop to charge the IPOD, it wipes everything out of my IPOD. I don't know why this keeps happening to me.
  I am trying different things to see if I can retrieve my music, but because my laptop doesn't have an external hard drive to copy CD's, it is very frustrating.

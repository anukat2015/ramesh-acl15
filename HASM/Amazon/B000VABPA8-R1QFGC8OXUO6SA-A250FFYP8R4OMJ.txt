Title: Great little player
Content:
I chose this Sony W. over a year ago because 1. there were no reports of erratic skipping when downloading music as with Zune & many other mp3 players. 2. I wanted to download books from the library (something I couldn't do with my proprietary ipod!), 3. I owned an ipod and was VERY dissatisfied with the battery life & warranty, 4. I wanted a radio.  The Sony walkman does everything I wanted. The only thing I would choose differently was a light color option, which would make the button labels easier to read (new models offer different colors) --of yes, and I did replace the earphones immediately! Still works like a charm and holds it's charge for hours. Great little player, I recommend it.

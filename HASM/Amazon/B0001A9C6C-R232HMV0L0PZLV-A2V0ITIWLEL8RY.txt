Title: Better than competitors
Content:
IPod quality and design is unbeatable. Just a few cons, the sound quality of the included headphones is regular to bad, battery life is very short, the surface of the body is easy to scratch so you better get and IPod skin. I bought the Sennheiser PX 100 Headphones, the sound quality now is superb. Go for it !

Title: quality heater, but large
Content:
As stated in online reviews, this is a high quality heater that has some unique features. My favorite: the heating elements are replaceable, which is more cost efficient in the long term than buying a new space heater. My previous heater was $30, yet lasted only a year. 
   The downside to this heater, which I have not seen mentioned anywhere, is the large size. A space heater should really be inconspicuous; the less you notice it, the better. This heater is the size of the speakers in my living room. It seems that the size could be reduced considering that many other heaters available aren't more than half the size of this model yet provide the same amount of heat.

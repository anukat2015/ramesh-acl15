Title: Excellent Machine, but replacement pitchers hard to find
Content:
Our household drinks gallons of iced tea year round.  Previously we have used the various (cheaper) iced tea makers from Mr. Coffee.  We find the Oster to make better iced tea, and makes it faster & easier.  All the parts are top-shelf dishwasher safe, and the included strainer basket eliminates the need for filters if you use loose tea.  It looks great on the countertop, and the black finish (unlike other brands) conceals the inevitable staining that comes with use. But beware! This machine has been discontinued by Oster, and they no longer have replacement pitchers available.  Having an extra pitcher is crucial for tea drinkers, especially during the summer.  Plus, the pitcher is glass, NOT plastic, and can easily break if you're not careful handling it (just ask me.....) I tried finding pitchers everywhere (on Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, Google shopping, etc., plus various Oster service centers) without success.   I ended up buying an extra machine just for the pitcher.

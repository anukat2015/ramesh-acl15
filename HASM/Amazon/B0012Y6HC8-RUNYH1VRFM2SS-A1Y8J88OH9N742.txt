Title: Disapointed, from a Canon Guy
Content:
As an owner of a Powershot 4mp(cant remember model number) and owner of a S3 IS, I expected the same quality as those cameras. However I was disappointed to receive a camera that would not focus at all on subjects that were not right in front of your face in a portrait style. 
Now I know your thinking, I just don't know anything about depth of field f stops etc. and that is not true. My father a photographer of 30yrs taught me  some things on the S3 IS in manual mode before I got the XSi and at f22 1/5 shutter on a tripod i could not get trees or anything in general to focus in my backyard in numerous shots on the XSi. Also my father himself had trouble getting clear and focused shots out of this camera. 
Long story short, I returned it and picked up a Nikon D60 and was able to get amazing shots out of it with little to no effort and am extremely happy.

Title: Great time to buy this camera
Content:
Watch for prices on this camera to drop as the Nikon D300 has been released.  Although the D300 is the 'next' generation, most of its new features will not be necessary for most photographers unless you want to use the 'video' feature.  I have two Nikons and in addition to the many features already mentioned, it feels quite comfortable in the hand: not too big or small, and just the right weight when you get accustomed to it, which, takes perhaps 3 or 4 days if you've been accustomed to a lighter model. But soon, it will feel like the perfect fit--unless you have some very unusual hand configuration.

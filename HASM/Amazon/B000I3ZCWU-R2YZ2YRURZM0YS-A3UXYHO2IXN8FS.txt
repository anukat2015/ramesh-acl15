Title: Canon XTi Digital SLR
Content:
Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Black) Awesome! I'm no pro photographer, but with the shots this rig allows me to take you would never know it. I've had a few "lesser" digital cameras over the past few years and was always irritated by the time delay from when I pressed the button till the camera decided it was ready to take the picture, bad juju for action shots! My family is envolved in drag racing and that anoying delay always cost me the optimal shot, not so with the XTi, It fires right now, and in rapid fire mode I am assured of getting the optimal photo. It can be as simple as any "Point and Shoot" camera so the whole family can use it, but it allows you to become as creative as your abilities allow! At the race track there is always a pro photographer in attendance taking pictures of all the cars hoping to sell them, and I always had to Wait in line to buy them ($50 to $80 typically) because my old cameras could not get the shots the pro could take(also with a Canon), not any more! I expect this Canon XTi will pay for itself in photos I don't have to buy from the pro any more! We love it!

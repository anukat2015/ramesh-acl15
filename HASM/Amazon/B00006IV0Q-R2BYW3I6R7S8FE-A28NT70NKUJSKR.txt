Title: What's Old is New
Content:
I'm not an every day coffee drinker, so I didn't want to invest in a programmable coffee maker. I selected the Presto coffeemaker for three reasons: (1) it can brew small batches of coffee as well as large servings; (2) it doesn't require much counter space in my kitchen; (3) it is easy to use. I brewed two cups of Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee on first use, and I was not disappointed. The coffee was rich, hot, and fast. I recommend using coffee filters to prevent grounds from settling as well as for easy clean up.

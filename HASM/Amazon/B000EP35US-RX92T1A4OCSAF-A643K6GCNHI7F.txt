Title: iPod Nano 2 GB
Content:
Good sound quality, very compact, impressive battery life. However, the standard earphones seem unable to handle the top volume of music without the music being distorted. The memory is rather limited, but you get what you pay for. Buy the 4 GB if you need the space. Oh, and the black one gets scratched VERY easily.

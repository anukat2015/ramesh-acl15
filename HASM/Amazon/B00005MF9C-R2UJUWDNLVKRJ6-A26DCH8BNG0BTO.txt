Title: A great cuppa joe -- to go!
Content:
I bought this little coffeemaker for making the first thing in the morning  coffee while away from home, though it would be great for home use also.It works very quickly, and I didn't have any sort of 'overflow' problem.  I still put a regular coffee filter into the basket to make cleanup a little easier.  Coffee comes out nice and hot, but of course it won't stay that way indefinitely as there is not any sort of warming device, just the insulated cup.I would recommend this item to anyone who likes to travel and have a cup of coffee without first leaving the cabin/hotel room/tent/etc.!

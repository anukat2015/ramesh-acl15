Title: burning smell from my brand new ul30vt-x1
Content:
The laptop seems good works good.
But somehow when i use there is always faint burning smell which is stronger near fan exhaust.
The smell is there both on power and battery.
The other thing is that when it is on power, you can touch and feel current in almunium case, which is not there when it is powered on battery.
Don't know if its some sort of internal short circuit.
I have stopped using it, lets see what asus can do about it.

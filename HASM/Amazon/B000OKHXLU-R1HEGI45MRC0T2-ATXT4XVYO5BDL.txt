Title: Decent, but not a substitute for an air conditioner
Content:
I am generally happy with my air cooler, but only under the conditions I use it.  Let me clarify; This is a great SUPPLEMENT to an air conditioner.  My bedroom will not cool down, no matter what temperature you set the air conditioner.  The air cooler does a nice job of cooling it down up to 5 degrees (with cold tap water).  Not to mention the added benefit of the humidity.  I could add ice, which would greatly help, but that would be more work and would cause my fridge to output more hot air.  (Simple physics - heat exchange.  Too bad I don't have a fridge outside.)  If you added ice, and your fridge was outside, it could MAYBE be a substitute for an air conditioner for one room, but I have not tried it. 
You should buy this product for your room if:
*You already have an air conditioner
*Your house is very dry
*You like/miss humidity (good for sinuses)
*You don't want to put an air conditioner in your window, or another air conditioner in your window. (Big advantage if you rent)
*You want to save electricity (Uses less than air conditioner)
*It does have a remote and a timer which is nice.  It also has different speeds which is nice, and includes some other useless buttons. 
Keep in mind:
*It will stop working once the humidity gets high.  It helps to own a humidistat.  For this reason, I use it only at night.  Of course, if you own an air conditioner, it will eventually take the humidity out of the air and you can use the air cooler again. 
*The water must be changed daily, preferably right before use.  (Colder water = better)
*Even if you change the water every day, the pan will have to be cleaned well at least once a month.  
*Mine started making an annoying rattling sound for the first few minutes.  I can't figure out what the sound is, how it's make, or how to stop it.  So, if I am going to sleep, I have to turn it on at least a half hour before.

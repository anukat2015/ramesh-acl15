Title: Love it
Content:
This little laptop is the perfect size, nice and thin but still large enough for easy use. It also makes a great alternative to a notebook which in my opinion is just to small. And would work well for a student or someone who travels a lot and would rather not lug around a more heavy laptop.
It runs nice and quiet and is very user friendly. The battery life is approx. six hours which is more than adequate.

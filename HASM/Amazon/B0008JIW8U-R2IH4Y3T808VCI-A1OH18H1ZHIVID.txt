Title: Works perfectly in my cubicle for fresh morning coffee
Content:
It's small enough so that it doesn't take up much space in my small cubicle, and I am treated each morning to a perfect large mug and a half of freshly-brewed coffee. Not being a morning person, I can't stand going to the break room, not knowing if the coffee there is fresh, or if someone grabbed a cup of it immediately when it started brewing (leaving the rest of the batch on the weak side). Last but definitely not least, I get to skip the annoying morning chit chat.
Mr. Coffee has been making coffeemakers for a while now; and you can tell. Everything about it works perfectly.

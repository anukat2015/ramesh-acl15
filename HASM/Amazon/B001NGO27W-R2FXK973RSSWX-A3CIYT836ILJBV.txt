Title: Makes a Really Good Cup of Coffee
Content:
Love this coffeemaker.  It replaces my prior Cuisinart, that was still working except for the timer, which is critical in my household.  Improvements to this new one are the water guide on the side of the machine, which is so convenient. This machine also drips back into itself when you open the top water fill cover...  what a concept!  The old machine, that I loved, dripped all over the counter unless you held a paper towel to it every time...  just not well designed.
One of the best features of the Cuisinart machine, and one of the main reasons we keep buying this brand is that it has a setting for the hot plate.  Since we prefer a glass carafe, unless you have a hot plate setting that can be turned to LOW (and it still keeps the coffee hot), you have burnt coffee after 15 minutes. LOVE THIS FEATURE.  We also like that you can set the machine for a richer brew or a regular brew.  Great machine overall.... we are very pleased.

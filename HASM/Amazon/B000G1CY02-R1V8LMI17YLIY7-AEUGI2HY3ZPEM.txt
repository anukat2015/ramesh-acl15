Title: Great heater for the money
Content:
I put this heater in my bedroom, which is fairly small and is heated by the house's radiator system.  However, the room is always a bit chilly.   It does a great job warming up the space.  I can set it on "1", which is the low power setting, and turn the thermostat to "4" and it knocks the chill out of the room in about 15 minutes.  
On the downside, it does smell bad when you first turn it on, but the smell burns off after a couple of uses.  
I would definitely purchase again.

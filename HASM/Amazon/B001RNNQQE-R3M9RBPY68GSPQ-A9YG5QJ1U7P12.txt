Title: best coffee maker I've ever owned
Content:
I have owned a Bunn, and it stopped working, so I bought this and have had it for over a year now and it is awesome, and dependable.  I love that the carafe is stainless steel and it keeps the coffee warmer a lot longer than the glass and it taste fresh.  I also love that it is programmable.  Just remember to clean it with a cup of vinegar and plenty of water every couple months to clean it.

Title: good allround very solid
Content:
I first bought the MPIO FL100- what a piece of junk, so flimsy I was scared to open the usb cover- I cannot believe the good reviews it got. As per the RD1080 this thing is great- solid nice little joystick to pick radio or mp3, decent reception on the FM radio- remember it is a portable so you won't get perfect reception always, but it works great for me. -nice software button lock- I thought I needed this because of the joystick but it never depresses in my pocket or bag-no real software playlist management not a big deal for me- there is a way to order the lists-EXPANDABLE- I put my 256 camera/PDA SD card in and I now have 384 mb of memory, more than enough. -Backlit -Cheap headphones, but whatever all headphone that come with this are junk. -nice armband for mp3 player-again very solid and well built.I am super happy with this that I went out and got the RCA 64mb lyra for my dad

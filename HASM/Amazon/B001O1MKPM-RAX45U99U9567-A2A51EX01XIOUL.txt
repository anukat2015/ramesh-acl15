Title: the best laptop EVER
Content:
This is not even close to my first laptop I get a new one at least once a year to keep up with the crazy needs of my job. I love this HP so much it is fast but you need to keep in mind that is has windows vista this will not make the laptop bad but if you hate vista you may not want this. I will say I have had lots of laptops that I have spent about 1,000USD more on that dont work as well. This is fast and will fill the needs of anyone in school it is also amazing for work and play. For the price it is well worth it. As far as the dark key issue I got moonlight white : ) so I have pretty white keys that shimmer a little. HP is always a brand you can trust even if there is a issue they will help you work through it.

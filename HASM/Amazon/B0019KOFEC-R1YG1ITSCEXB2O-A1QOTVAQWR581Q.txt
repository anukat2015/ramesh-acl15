Title: This vacuum sucks!
Content:
Works great, easy set up, doesn't sound like a 747. It has lots of power. The extra pet attachment is great for upholstry even without a pet. I have all hardwood floors so can't tell you how it works on carpets. I think it would need a power nozzle to be most effective for carpeting.
One really nice feature is the telescoping wand. It makes it just the right height for comfort and then can reach those high, cobweb corners. The swivel nozzle can really get very flat for getting under low furniture.
I also think the hose is a bit on the flimsy side, so I'm careful not to let it crimp. That's my only con.

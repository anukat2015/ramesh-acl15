Title: Fix for the carafe drip
Content:
I love my Bunn coffee pot, but, I also had problems with the carafe dripping after a month or so.  I fixed the problem by rubbing a small amount of vegetable oil on the outside spout of the carafe.  You can wipe the oil right off again, and you don't taste it, but this really works.  I do it every month or so.  I've given this solution to two friends, and they can't believe it works. I also did it today with the top of the coffee carafe because it was overflowing a bit.  (I've had my Bunn for over a year.)  Fixed that, too!!  Try it, you'll see!

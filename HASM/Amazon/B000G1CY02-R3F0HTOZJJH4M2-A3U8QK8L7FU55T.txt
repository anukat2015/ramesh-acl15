Title: Quiet heat; quick comfort
Content:
We have been pleased with the quiet heat provided by this space heater, which we are using in a three-seasons room.  To date, outdoor temps have registered no lower than 28 F, so its effectiveness in providing supplemental heat when the Iowa winter really sets in remains to be tested.  However, we will, meanwhile, enjoy the silent warmth it provides to ease a chilly morning or evening.

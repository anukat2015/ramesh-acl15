Title: An Early Death...
Content:
Our kids got us this coffeemaker last year for Christmas, and it died a few days ago.  I didn't use the gold filter basket (included), because the fine coffee sediment leaked through (leaving the fine grounds in the bottom of your cup...ewww!) So, I just used a typical "cupcake liner" filter.  I did like the "auto shut-off" feature, and coffee taste was o.k., but it was hard to fill with water (the lid lifts off to the back, and you have to have good aim!), plus the carafe leaked everytime I poured coffee, unless I poured way too slowly.  I'm disappointed that this was not a cheap machine, but only lasted a year.  When I go to buy my next coffeemaker, it won't be a Black and Decker.

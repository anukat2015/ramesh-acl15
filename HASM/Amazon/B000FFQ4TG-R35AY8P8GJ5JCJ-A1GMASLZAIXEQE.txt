Title: Bunn NHBX-B
Content:
I love my Bunn coffee maker, the only problem I have is that sometimes it doesn't make a full pot of coffee.  I use a pitcher for the water and the same measurement every time, but sometimes it falls short of the 10 cups.  I also use bottled water from Culligan only, our tap water is so bad even my dog won't drink it.

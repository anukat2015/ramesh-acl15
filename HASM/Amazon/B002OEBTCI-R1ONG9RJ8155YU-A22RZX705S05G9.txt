Title: Worth every penny!!!
Content:
This is my first Dslr, never been trained, never took classes, but this is so simple to figure out. The instruction book gave lots of information that was easy to understand. Just playing a little and you can figure allot of things out. The pictures are sharp and clear and the different things you can do to your pictures while they are still in the camera is pretty awesome. The interface was pretty easy for me to figure out. I love this camera!! My last camera was also a pentax and it lasted me 14 years. I hope to get the same or more out of this one!! It's worth every penny!!

Title: Great for Room Heating in Old Houses!
Content:
We bought three of these last year, and plan on another couple this year.  Our old (1900) house had way to many radiators, but none in the little bath under the stairs.  We had to choose between leaving all the doors between rooms open and wasting a lot of heat, and closing the doors and having a freezing bathroom and an overheated kitchen, living room, and family room.  The massive radiator in the hallway sent all its heat upstairs (yet was controlled by the downstairs thermostat).  The whole house was to warm or to cold.
So when we redesigned the downstairs we removed three radiators, and bought several of these heaters.  Our gas heat bill went down significantly, and now we use these heaters in the bathroom, hallway, and an unheated attic room.  The timer means they only operate in the morning & evening when we need them, so they have not driven up the electric bill that much.  They also throw a nice even heat, and the combination of 96 timer switches (one for each 20 minutes of the day) and the thermostat keeps the heat just right and there when we need it.
My only criticism is that a digital electronic timer would be easier to use, and having weekday / weekend programs would be better in working with our 7 day schedule.  But the benefits of this far outweigh these minor problems.
If you have a problem with uneven heat in your home, a few of these units carefully placed and programmed can pay for themselves in a year or less, and make your home more comfortable every day of the winter.

Title: Canon 5D Mark II vs Nikon D200
Content:
Super fun new camera!  I have been using the Canon 5D Mark II for the past 2 weeks since using a Nikon D200 every day for the past few years.
I realize that the 5D is in a different class from the D200 but surprisingly the D200 compares pretty favorably.
Here are some pros and cons, some in comparisons to the D200 and others not:
Cons:
- 5D Mk 2 feels a lot slower than the D200, I did not think that the lower frame rate would be so noticeable.
- I need new lenses.
Pros:
- The 5D is amazing and has such great low noise at high ISOs that I can get printable shots in near darkness!
- I need new lenses... This is the main reason I switched to Canon; more fast prime lenses available.
- video! another compelling reason to switch...
Other than these, comparable class Nikons and Canons are essentially the same and both produce amazing quality files.

Title: Nice Computer
Content:
I've had this computer now for a little over a month and I really like it.  It has a nice solid feel and is much faster than my old Dell Inspiron. Windows 7 is awesome. My only complaints would be the short battery life and the mediocre sound of the speakers, both which are really not an issue for me personally but may be for someone else. Had to spend some time trying to find a carrying case for this large computer and bought the Toshiba 18" Metropolitan Case- perfect for transporting the computer around! The computer is exactly what I expected after reading all the other reviews and I think it's well worth the price!

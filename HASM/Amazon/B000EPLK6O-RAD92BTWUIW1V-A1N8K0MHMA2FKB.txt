Title: Simple is Good
Content:
I really enjoy using this coffee maker each morning. Besides the great tasting coffee I appreciate the simplicity of the design. There's an on/off switch and that's it. The set up of doing the brewing inside the pot (combined with the removable reservoir) is incredibly straightforward and easy to clean as a result.
I would not recommend this coffee maker if you do a lot of entertaining - but I don't think that was ever the purpose of this machine. It brews two (extra large) mugs of coffee at a time, perfect for my daily routine of brewing enough coffee for just one or two people.

Title: Krups FME2-14
Content:
Makes a very fast pot of coffee which was a major improvement over my previous coffee maker (Mr. Coffee). The coffee is hot, but not burnt. I roast my own coffee beans so a coffee maker that does not destroy the coffee while brewing is important to me. This one delivers. The other features in this coffee maker are nice but not as important to me - beeps when it is finished brewing the coffee, programmable clock to preset when it starts, etc. I would buy it again!

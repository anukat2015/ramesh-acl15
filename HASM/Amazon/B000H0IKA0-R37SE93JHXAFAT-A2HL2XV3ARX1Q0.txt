Title: A miracle in design and functionality. Apple's masterpiece!
Content:
As an avid Ipod user, and Apple brand loyalist, I can honestly say that very little surprises me when it comes to the brilliance of Apple products. They are in every sense of the word perfect, and when it comes to design and functionality, they are unrivaled. However, when my Ipod shuffle arrived in the mail this morning, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer beauty and brilliance of this small device. Forget any conceptions you may have regarding the previous generation shuffles, because this is quite possibly the masterpiece Apple has been working towards. Simple, elegant, cool, shiny, beautiful, affordable - there aren't enough words to describe it. Once this little thing is in your palm, you will be in love! 
The sound quality this small device can produce is unbelievable, and with the right headphones, you will be in 'sweet-spot' heaven.
Don't think, just buy. It would be almost criminal not to purchase this device!

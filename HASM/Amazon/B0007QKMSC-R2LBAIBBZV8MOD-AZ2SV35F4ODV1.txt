Title: Excellent Camera
Content:
I have owned the Digital Rebel XT many months ago and have been mostly pleased.  The various modes give great control over subjects and the size makes it easy to carry around to the various locations.  The camera started giving "Error 99" and eventually ended up sending it to Cannon in California.  They fixed the problem quickly, and because I had my original Proof of Purchase information and warranty card, did not charge me, and sent it back mostly fixed.  The meter still acts up at random times highlighting multiple instances in the meter display when it gets an light source on it.  It is still an amazing camera, much lower in price now than when I purchased in new,  though it would be good to explore your options.

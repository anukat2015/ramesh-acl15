Title: questions
Content:
This Ipod is first for me.  I purchased it because I drive a lot and like to listen to books.  Problem I am having is that sometimes the book will "drop" and then start at a different location.  I can't figure out how to back it up or rewind..... I am I thinking old school?  What causes the drops and why would it happen in the same place? My Ipod came with a tiny sheet of instructions...but that was it. If you can help me, speak very plainly because I am "challenged" - just ask my daughter. Thanks.

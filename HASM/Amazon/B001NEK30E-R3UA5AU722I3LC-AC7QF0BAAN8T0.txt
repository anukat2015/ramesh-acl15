Title: Hmmmmmm.......
Content:
I got this laptop 4 months ago and i was fascinated by it and i actually wrote the following review    
"This laptop Is so great...blazing fast and you can play lots of games at decent performance...but some of the new games won't be that great specially at high resolution ( like Crysis for instance).....but the only problem that i find annoying is the smudgy dusty chassis.....fusion looks cool but if there's a lot of dust in the air you have to  clean your laptop almost daily....and the price dropped 50 $ 2 daYS AFTER i bought it
final thoughts: great multitasking laptop for every day use and casual gaming... but for hardcore gamers u have to consider a higher laptop for some extra bucks"
but after acquiring it for more than 4 months i can honestly say that i was disappointed  ....the fusion design is completely impractical especially in dusty environments .....that doesn't mean that that it gets covered with dust and that's it....but the overall design is bad though it looks good....the surface easily scratches because of the accumulated dust and another thing is that the computer body and keyboard left some marks on the screen which is a big pain in the [...]., another thing is that i got at least 2 stuck pixels and one big dead spot which is at least 3 by 3  pixels....and i knew about the damn toshiba dead pixel policy so i got more disappointed since that spot is in the upper middle of the screen................,bottom line this time:
Donn't buy this laptop if u intend to close the lid some day or live around some dust......

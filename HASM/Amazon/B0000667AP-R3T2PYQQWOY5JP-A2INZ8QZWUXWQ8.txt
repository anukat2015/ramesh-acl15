Title: Better Than I Hoped For
Content:
I wanted a unit that I could use working out, but I didn't want to buy more expensive memory for my mp3 player. This new Minidisc has wonderful sound and is very well made.  The nice thing about is it is fairly small and is perfect for the outdoors.  You don't have to worry about it.  Thanks for everybodies reviews, I wouldn't have wanted to miss out on this player.  It is made me a big fan of Minidisc

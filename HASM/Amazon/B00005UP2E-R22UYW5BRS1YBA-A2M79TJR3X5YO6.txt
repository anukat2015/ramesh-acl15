Title: Great little canister!
Content:
I used one of these vacs for years and finally wore it out.   As a replacement I got a Hoover canister vac, instead of replacing it with another Dirt Devil Breeze.   Big mistake.  The Hoover was like a boat anchor.  Heavy, didn't roll well, the hand grip was so large it gave me blisters on my hand every time I used it.   Finally gave up and got another Dirt Devil Breeze and love it.  The motor is as powerful as the Hoover canister vac, but the vac itself is SO much easier to use. It rolls well, has a lot of suction, is light and easy to maneuver.   Using this vac isn't a chore, it's not difficult to carry it as you vacuum stairs.   I'd highly recommend this vac to anyone who has floors with no carpeting.  This isn't a vac for those who have wall to wall carpeting.   The best use for it is on bare floors.   Can't say enough good things about it ~ all A++++.

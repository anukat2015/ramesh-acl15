Title: Exceeds Expectation
Content:
The 6th Generation Ipod Classic exceeded my expectations.  Software problems mentioned in some other reviews are non-existent.  I did purchase Bose ear pieces due to the fact that the ear pieces which come with the Apple are hard to keep in the ear.  I use the unit in the home, car and gym.  I did purchase an "incase" leather case which protects the unit and make it easy to clip on belt or waistband, or just put in your pocket.

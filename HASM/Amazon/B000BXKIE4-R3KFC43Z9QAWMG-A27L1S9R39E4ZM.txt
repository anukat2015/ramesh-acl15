I purchased one of these and have been using it for a little over a month. At this point I am totally thrilled with the product for the price. I have owned exectrolux products in the past that were more expensive and a hoover product for about the same price. To say the least I am back to electrolux. I love being able to go under furniture, and being able to disconnect head and use in tight or unusual spots with various attachments. We have a dog and this is a wonderful fur finder! The filtration systems are great for keeping dust and dirt where it belongs once it is sucked up. I'll never stray from electrolux again.

Title: Can't Take a Bad Picture
Content:
I have two kids, so getting both to sit still and smile at the SAME time, is virtually impossible.  The shutter control on this puppy is awsome, you don't miss a thing.  I knew I was going to make an investment when trying to search for the best SLR so I did a lot of research.  I even went out and purchased a Cannon but took it back because it just wasn't what I wanted.  I have had nothing but great shots with this D40.  The 6.1 MP is just fine for what I need, the biggest pictures I would ever print is an 8x10 so this is more than adequate.  The only fall back about this particular lense kit (18-55) is that I defintely needed a bigger lense to get the candid shots.   I went ahead and purchased the 55-200 mm with VR which is an awsome addition and very well worth the extra $250.  
I like the idea that I can change the picture to black and white on the LCD after I've taken it.  The first picture I took with this camera can easily be a framed picture that you would purchase in the store.  All pictures after are all great.  Everyone looks at the pictures I take of their kids and wants a copy, you just can't take a bad picture with this camera and I would highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed.

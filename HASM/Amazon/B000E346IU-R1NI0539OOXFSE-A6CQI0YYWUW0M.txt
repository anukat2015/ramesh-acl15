Honeywell HZ-617 Low Profile Silent Comfort HeaterWe have been seduced by all of the adds in papers, throwaways etc about the "Amish Heater" and others, so made the mistake of buying one of the Amish heaters.  In looking to see whether to buy another or the other highly advertise one, I looked at Consumer Reports that had rated them very poorly.  Having rated the Honeywell highly and it cost about 1/5th of the others I looked on Amazon and found it.  We are very happy with it.  My wife who is always cold uses it to allow us to keep our thermostat at a lower level and thereby same money in the long run.  It is quiet and puts out a nice stream of heat.

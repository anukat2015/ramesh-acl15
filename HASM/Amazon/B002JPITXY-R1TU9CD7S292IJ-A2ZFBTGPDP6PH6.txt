Title: Just a side note
Content:
I just wanted to point out. Although I own an iPod and Zune, I will not compare the 2 but simply compare Zune to iTunes. Zune offers a fifteen dollars per month fee for UNLIMITED music downloads, granted the files need to be synced every month, which the zune does automatically when you plug it in, this is something iTunes can't even touch. It's an incredible deal, AND you get to keep i believe ten of those songs! so all in all you are paying 5 dollars for unlimited music rental. Phenomenal. I don't want to confuse people into thinking that zune charges you monthly, because zune is free software, but if you want unlimited downloads it's an option.

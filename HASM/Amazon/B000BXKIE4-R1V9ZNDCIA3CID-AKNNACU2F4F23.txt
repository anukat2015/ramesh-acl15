Title: WOW am I glad I bought this appliance!
Content:
This is a great great vacuum cleaner. I am so glad I bought it. I have 2 hairy hairy dogs in my carpeted bedroom and the power head sucks up all their hair without a hitch. They also have a dog door into the bedroom which brings in dust, etc so the carpet is gettin heavy use AND, the rest of my house is hard wood floors and I can switch over in a second and keep on going.  I love that the controls are in the handle, so I can turn it on and off without having to bend over and find a button on the canister. A really great thing, is when you change the vacuum cleaner bag, it has this little panel that slides over the opening so none of the dust can escape. Highly Highly recommend.

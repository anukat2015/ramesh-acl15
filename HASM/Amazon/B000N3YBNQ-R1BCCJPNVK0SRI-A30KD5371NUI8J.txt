Title: Small Package Packs Plenty of Power
Content:
My wife received this as a gift from our son last year. Wow. This wonderful unit does not disappoint. Fast to set up with magnificent results. No need to go over and over the problem area - the Electrolux Intensity gets it right on the first pass. So simple it almost makes vacuuming fun. Yes, I actually help out cleaning the house.
Some people feel that the disposable bag is too small. My spin is positive. I prefer a smaller bag - I don't have to smell the air discharge through the nasty stuff that will accumulate over time inside a larger bag. The small bag fills up - toss it. Clean air discharge each time you vacuum. Nice. You can reorder the bags though Amazon at only $7.99 for a six pack including a new filter. Too easy.
For me, this is a well thought out design from a company that his been around since 1910. The Electrolux Intensity upright vacuum cleaner is a small wonder built to last and easy to store.
Everyone has different cleaning requirements in mind when they decide on a vacuum purchase. That being so, there is no perfect vacuum for all situations. But, for vacuuming either hard or carpeted surfaces easily, the Electrolux Intensity is tough to beat. After one year of constant use, both my wife and I have no complaints.

Title: Powerful Vacuum, but heavy
Content:
This is a great vacuum if you are looking for power.  I previously had a canister vacuum and had tried and returned several uprights before buying this one.  The suction power is excellent, and the Hepa filter is easy to clean.  If you are looking for a small vacuum, this one is not for you as the width is pretty wide and will not fit under some furniture unless you switch to the attachments.  The parts are quite durable and well-made, which however also results in them being quite heavy.  All in all I am very happy with it except for the bulkiness and awkwardness of moving around.  Be careful when moving around the canister so as not to dent your furniture.  Love the retractable cord!

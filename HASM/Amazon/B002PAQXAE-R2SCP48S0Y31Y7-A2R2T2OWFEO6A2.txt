Title: the best deal between netbooks and laptops
Content:
This is the first time I write a review on Amazon. This model just forced me to do so. 
Previously, I purchased Lenovo S12 Idealpad and Samsung NC 10 netbook,
both of which I returned. I found Samsung NC 10 was too small for my large hands. 
Lenovo S12 had too noisy a fan and the pad was easily heated and vibrated. 
I think the Asus new model is a great deal that I have been looking for between slow netbooks
and heavy laptops. I am quite sensitive to noise and heat, and this model is almost quiet,
though it could sometimes feel slightly warm, but that's minimal comparable to my Lenovo T400. 
It's amazing it has a dual core cpu for this price. I would say it's the revolution for 12.1 inch laptops.
My only con is that the keys on the touchpad is quite hard to press for dragging. 
I usually use a mouse, so that wouldn't bother much. 
So far, the best 12.1 inch laptop for the price.

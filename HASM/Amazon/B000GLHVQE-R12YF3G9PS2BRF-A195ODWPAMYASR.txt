Title: Not Bad for the price
Content:
I purchased this fireplace for my elderly mother who is always cold. It is a nice fireplace for the money. It heats a 22 X 22' room quite easily. My son has been using this item where there is no heat in his room.  In the middle of the night he has to shut it off as it warms the room too much.  I am not sure my mother can use this because you can't shut the flames off at night and it might not be easy for her to sleep with the glow.  Another not so great feature is the on, low, high switches.  They are located way down on the bottom and near the back leg. It may not be easy for her turn it off and on late at night, so for now, my son will use it until we figure out if it is worth giving it to her.  
It is quiet and heats nicely and if you are not elderly, there should be no problem sleeping with some light and turning it on and off. Would be nice to have a thermostat, an easy on & off switch and flame on/off switch.  A remote would be a great idea to use on this one.
This fireplace is used in upstate NY where our temperatures have dropped into the low 20's already and it has kept the room very warm.  It is a good value for the money.

Things I don't like about this heater:
* No display of current temperature
* Thermostat can only be set in 5 degree increments (65, 70, 75, etc)
* Timer mechanism is really just "delayed shutoff"
That said, the heat output is effective and it's an attractive design but the features are fairly mediocre.  The remote is handy but how often do you need to get up and change the settings on your heater?  I also thought the timer feature might be something where I could set it to do certain temperatures during certain time periods (e.g., 65 when I'm not home, 70 when I am) but it's really just a "delayed shutoff", like you can set it to run for 7 hours and then shut off, which is of dubious usefulness.
Feature-wise, I like my Delonghi DFH480M better.  If I could take the heat output from this heater and everything else from the Delonghi, it would be perfect.

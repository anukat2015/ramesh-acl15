Title: Best entry level DSLR equivalent hands down!!
Content:
I'll try no to repeat what's already been said, but rather summarize my experience and provide some insight to things I feel are the most important. First of all, this camera really depends on your needs, because it's unique and not a do-it-all like some suggested. Let's drill down the tree of what we're comparing to by first highlighting the biggest advantages and drawbacks to the camera.
NOTE: I'm only comparing the camera to entry or mid-level DSLRs. It doesn't match high-end DSLRs, and doesn't serve the same functions.
Biggest advantages:
* Form factor (especially with the 20mm/f1.7) - size and weight
* Ease of use - your significant other can get great shots even if he/she isn't into photography
* VERY accurate metering - can't blow easy/medium shots with intelligent Auto (but tough shots require more)
* intelligent modes just simply get it right 90% of the time - you don't need to be a pro to shoot!
* The 20mm/f1.7 lens is just simply outstanding!!
Biggest drawbacks:
* Expensive (I tend to discount that - memories are worth more than a few hundred dollars)
* Poor selection of lenses
* No flash button
* No viewfinder (or rather, $200 more expensive to get an electronic one)
Things I don't care about:
* Build quality - it's super solid, but I don't think it or any other camera would survive a fall to concrete.
* Weak flash - all internal flashes are weak, but they're convenient.
* The manual sucks - but practice makes perfect anyway
* movie mode - give me a break! All cameras today are pretty much the same, some shoot full 1080p HD but low frame rate, GF1 only shoots 720p - but they look the same to me. If you want to shoot good videos with great quality, get a camcorder.
Some comments about other reviews:
* shooting with VF is great - but VF is still important for sports shots and more importantly for extra bright days. EVF is more bulky and extra $200
* it does have horizon markings and grid
* I personally didn't even consider the EP-1 or EP-2 to be competition. Regardless of GF-1 coming out better in most tests, one crucial feature to a m43 is built-in flash. If you have to walk around with an external flash (like on the EP1 or EP2), that negates the whole point of compactness - just get a DSLR.
==================
Some drilling down to help you choose:
* If you are into photography as an art, get a DSLR. They're still more versatile and you'll get more choice of lenses - and you're probably carrying around a significant package anyway.
* For portraits this camera (with 20mm f1.7 lens) simply can't be beat. Quality is outstanding and can match mid-range DSLR easily. The bokeh is beautiful! And if it's day-to-day that you want (like catching your kids at the right moment), let's see you do that with a DSLR. It may fire within 0.1sec, but takes 10secs to setup...
* If you want your photos (e.g. family photos rather than scenery), you'll have to let others take pictures too. Like strangers taking pictures of your entire family, your spouse taking pictures when she doesn't care to read the 200 page manual - if that's the case, THIS CAMERA BEATS EVERYTHING ELSE BY A MILE!!! Taking pictures with auto settings and using the LCD is Soooooooo much easier with this camera.
* Don't know what it is - indoor closeup flash pics just meter so much better than with T1i or D5000.
* Contrast focus is fast! Faster than most entry level DSLRs, that's for sure.
Summary:
Buy a DSLR if:
* you don't care about package size
* you want diversity and flexibility in what you photograph today and in the future (like taking photos of a basketball game, then go out and take scenery shots) and want different lenses for different tasks.
For everything else, this will deliver the good, and then some!!

Title: easy beautiful
Content:
This camera is much more than I expected, I can hand it to my 7 year old and he gets amazingly good pictures. The picture quality is wonderful. The point and click mode works so well that I have trouble wanting to use it as a straight SLR but even when I do I still get amazing pictures! The only drawback I have found is that it will not take an SD card smaller than 4 meg, make sure you get one! I purchased an extra battery too but I have yet to use it. Great family camera.
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great quality, easy to use digital camera, or a beginning SLR user.

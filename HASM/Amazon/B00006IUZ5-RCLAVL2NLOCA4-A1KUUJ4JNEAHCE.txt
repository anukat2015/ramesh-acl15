Title: Nice for someone who makes single "cuppas" several times a day
Content:
This is a great little gadget. My fella drinks three or four cups of hot tea a day, as well as one or two cups of coffee - but he won't touch a tea kettle or coffee pot. Each cup has to be made fresh. He loves this gadget because he can make the individual servings, never has left-overs to throw away - and has his fresh-made beverage in just seconds. We highly recommend this as a gift, office, or personal-use item.

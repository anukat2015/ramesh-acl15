Title: Very nice MP3 Player
Content:
I purchased this MP3 player for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas based on reviews that indicated it was easy to use and the software was very user friendly.  It lived up to the expectations.  It's a nice size for her small hands and she very quickly learned the controls and was able to copy music to it from our laptop without too much instruction from me.  The only issue I could see with the item was that the battery was so dead when we received it that it took charging over night for it to work longer than a couple hours but once it was fully charged it worked perfectly.  I would definitely recommend this player to others.  TigerDirect shipping was a little slow but still made it in the ammount of time it said it would.

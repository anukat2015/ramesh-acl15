Title: Best Vacuum Yet
Content:
Over the past 30 years I've owned Eureka's, Sears, Electrolux's, Dirt Devil, and even a Sanitaire.  Nothing comes close to cleaning like this vacuum.  
We have two golden retrievers which shed A LOT - no problem for this vacuum, be it on the hard flooring or the carpeting.
If you need a vacuum, this is it.

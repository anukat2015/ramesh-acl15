Title: ACER: IT Geeks only
Content:
I'm not a techie so I wont write a technical review. From a purely layperson perscpective this is goes down as one of my most regrettable purchases, right up there with the Ford Fiesta.
I only wish I would have returned it but Best Buy gives you a measly 14 days for a refund and since it takes about that long for a non-techie to figure out that it is the pc and not you - well I'm stuck with this piece of crap. 
I cant tell you how many times I've gotten the blue screen of death, it started almost immediately and crashes all the time. It happens so often that it doesnt scare me anymore. Its got issues with the sticky keys, the right/ left clicking, and now the left clicker completely broke. I turned it on today and the left click key is just kinda stuck in "clicked" mode. I certainly didnt mash it last night when i turned it off so what happened? Evil left-clicker gremlins attacked it in the night?
I have never had so many problems, continuously, with any other laptop - I got my 1st Mac notebook in 1992 - I've had at least 5 since then, plus the ones I've used at work. I will never buy an acer again, and unless you can work on it yourself, I would suggest you go with HP, Dell, or one of the other standards. they may not be perfect but at least they werent as bad as this!

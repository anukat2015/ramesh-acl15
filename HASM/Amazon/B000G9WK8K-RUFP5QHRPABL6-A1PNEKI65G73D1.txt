Title: Things are not what they use to be
Content:
This is the third  BUNN coffee maker we have purchased in 20+ years. This one is cheaply constructed by comparison. The top slants forward and the brewing cone and the carafe don't line up. The unit has also forced water over the filter section causing a large mess to clean up. BUNN still brews the best coffee and the quickest so what can one do?

Title: Please, Please read!
Content:
A year ago I tried a friends Dyson Animal, and loved it, but couldn't justify spending that kind of money.  So I read a bunch of reviews and bought the Pet Eraser.  I was amazed that it did the same job as the animal!  (I have four dogs.)  Now a year later, when I would get on the floor to do yoga, I would notice lots of dog hair, and noticed that the brush on the vacuum would only spin on a higher setting, so the carpet wasn't getting clean and staying matted down.
I borrowed my friend's Animal again, and was really depressed to see how much better it worked than my Pet Eraser a year later.  I suspected that it needed a new belt even though it still looked like new.  Read some reviews this morning on this site and saw a woman commenting on a belt w/ teeth, which made sense, but knew that the Pet Erasers was smooth.  Decided before I did anything drastic, I would try a new belt.  Got the belt home and was AMAZED to see that even though the old belt looked new, it had stretched a couple of inches.  Happy to report that the vacuum works like new again!!  The brush spins w/ no problem at the lowest setting.  It even picked stuff up after using the animal twice yesterday.
Please don't let some of the bad reviews here deter you from trying this vacuum.  You will just need to buy a new belt every 9 mos. or so.

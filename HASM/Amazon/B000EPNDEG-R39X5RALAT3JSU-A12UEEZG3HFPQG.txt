Title: Ummm, duh, I should have bought one of these the first time I bought an mp3 player
Content:
What else can I say that hasn't already been said? Ipods rule! Anyone who disagrees is wrong. I've owned two different players from Apple's competitors and there were always limitations to those players. The ipod does what I want and sounds awesome. If you are on the fence about spending a little more for an ipod, consider this your push... just do it!

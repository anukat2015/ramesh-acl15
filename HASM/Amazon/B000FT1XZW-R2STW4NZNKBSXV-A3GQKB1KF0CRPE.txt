Title: great little space heater at a great price
Content:
I paid $15-20 more for this heater, so when my other one started making strange noises, I was glad to replace it at Amazon's place.  Not really enough to fully heat a room, it's more of an auxiliary heater, drafty places that need extra warmth.  I put it near my desk so that I am toast when I write.  Very cheap to operate and great on cool morns when you don't really want a heater, but something to break the chill.  Can adjust from 600 BTU-1500, without all the worry that electric heaters always give me.

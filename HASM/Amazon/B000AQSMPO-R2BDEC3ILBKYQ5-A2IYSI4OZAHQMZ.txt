Title: Disappointed
Content:
This fancy-pants coffee maker was a big disappointment. I bought this for my husband for his birthday - looking for a great pod coffee system. This coffee maker isn't it.
He was excited to unwrap his gift - seeing as how we spotted this machine in Bloomingdales. We loved the appearance...but the love stopped there.
 
Sure, it's fast & easy to set-up, BUT...the coffee quality is poor, no better than instant coffee. And on the "travel mug" setting, it only fills the mug about 2/3 full. We tried to brew the same K-cup twice to get it to fill the mug, but that only made the coffee taste like hot water. Our plain Mr. Coffee coffee maker brews better tasting coffee, and fills our mug - no matter what the size. I guess if it means cleaning out the filter everyday, it's worth it for better tasting coffee.
 
Save your money.

Title: Could have been SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!
Content:
Could have been SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!
2 be honest i brought this for the memory space. I have tons of DVDs that i copied onto my iPod so i already at this point exceeded the 80GB threshold. So i decided to sell my 80GB and shell out an extra 100.00 for the 160GB. I brought the black model & was soooo disappointed. The quality has really GONE DONE HILL!! Apple cuts corners in the WORST way. The black looks so CHEAP & POORLY made. The silver looks nice & that's what i should have gone with. I didn't encounter iTunes issues like everyone else did, i had a breeze with mine. But selecting a song can take 2 seconds longer then it normally does. Fast forwarding a movie can take a few seconds longer then it normally does compared with the previous iPod video. Just feels like a step down. The funny thing is this isn't Apple's 1st iPod. When you make a device, you learn its flaws & fix it for the newer model. That isn't the case here. Overall it is a good device but it hasn't EVOLVED. If they had created an iPod Touch with 160GB memory that would have been nice & i wouldn't be as disappointed as i am. That's the evolution i was looking for, but it didn't happen here. So I'm cutting back on memory and moving onto the Zune 80GB with a bigger LCD screen. The iPod screen is getting so OLD & small looking. The sound quality is also a bit on the LOW SIDE. Why have a volume setting feature when it doesn't even work. Apple READ & EVOLVE properly. For now goodbye from me (Former iPod Nation Member)

Title: Good DSLR
Content:
It's a good DSLR. With the 18-85 IS lens, you can take a lot of photos in daily life. And the quality of the photos will be good under a good light condition. If you want to take a photo with higher quality, another good lens is needed. Fortunately, it is easy to find a proper one.

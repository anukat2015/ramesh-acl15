Title: Don't buy this!
Content:
Hoover Windtunnel S3765-040
This broke within one week of purchasing.  The belt that rotates the carpet brush kept popping off everytime I used it.  This is a piece of junk. I will not be buying a Hoover again and am surprised this happened after all the good reviews.

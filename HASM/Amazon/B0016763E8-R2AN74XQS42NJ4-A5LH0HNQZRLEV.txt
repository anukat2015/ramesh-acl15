Title: Philips MP3 Player is a Failure
Content:
I have to agree with the other two reviewers that were NOT  happy with this unit.  I've owned a Philips portable MP3 CD player as well as a LCD wide screen TV and love both of them.  I was optimistic about buying this, compared to my satisfaction with the other two.  WRONG!!!  This "thing" does not work with either Rhapsody or Windows Explorer.  Both recognize it but when dragging and dropping music to the player - Rhapsody freezes up and Windows Explorer just sits there trying to do it but no songs move.  Sad.  I will be returning this piece of trash ASAP.

Title: Really, really tiny!
Content:
I love the reflective heaters and when my last one went kaput, I bought this one without looking very closely at it. It's REALLY tiny. It would work as a little desk heater but my cats think I've pulled a fast one. They love to lay in front of these but this one would only heat one cat at a time and it wouldn't cover me into the bargain.
If you need an itty bitty desk heater or foot warmer, this one would work. I'm sending mine back for a larger version though.

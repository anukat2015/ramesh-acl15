Title: My First Hoover
Content:
I read all the reviews I could find and finally settled on the WindTunnel Bagless, I was a little cautious about the bagless concept and about the comments about the handle being weak.  Well the vacuum is great, love the bagless, but I do agree with the other reviewers the handle is weak and doesn't stand up on its own very well. Overall I am very pleased though.

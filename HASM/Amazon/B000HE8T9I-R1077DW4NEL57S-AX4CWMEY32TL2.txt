Title: Terrible Suction and Poor Contruction
Content:
I owned a Dirt Devil Featherlight bagless for close to 5 years now.  When that started to die on me, I thought I try this one based on the "filterless" design and flash.
I can't compare the suction to the Dyson but this thing would barely pick up a clump of pet hair off hardwood.  My old vacuum would suck that stuff up from a good 12 inches off.  In other words, it didn't suck at all.  You had to be right over stuff to pick anything up at all.
Build quality was another issue.  The "convienient" handle/hose attachment wouldn't lock in unless you slammed it down.  I know mine wasn't the only one with this problem because there was a returned unit in the store when I bought mine that was on clearance because of a "broken handle".  It's not broken, just poor design.

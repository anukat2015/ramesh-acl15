Title: Better Than and Ipod
Content:
I have had an Ipod for a couple of years now and I have had so many problems with it. For example the files not loading up right, and we had to reformat it several times. I haven't had my Zune that long yet but it is miles above the Ipod. First it is very user friendly all the playlist options and the touch pad is very nice. I use it mostly for the gym and having the arm strap is great. It is easy to go through songs and turn the volume up and down just by sliding your finger along the pad. The upload for songs is much faster as well. Not to mention all the different file types you can put on it. It is a great product and I wouldn't go back to my Ipod for anything.

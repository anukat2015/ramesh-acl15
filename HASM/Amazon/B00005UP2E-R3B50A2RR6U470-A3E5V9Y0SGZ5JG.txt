Title: Best All Around
Content:
I have a vacuum on each of 3 floors, both upright and canister.   In the past 3 years I have replaced all the canisters with the Breeze Bagless Canister.
  Great suction and light weight.   Couldn't be more pleased.   In fact, I have purchased one for my daughter-in-law and two for my daughter.

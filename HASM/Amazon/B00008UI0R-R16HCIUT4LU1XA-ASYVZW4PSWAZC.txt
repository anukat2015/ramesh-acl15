Title: Hoover S3765-040
Content:
I purchased this product based upon the great reviews of consumer reports as well as from other people who have purchased this item.  I will agree that this vac has tremendous suction, but otherwise I am highly disappointed with this product. I will never purchase another vacuum online without trying it out somewhere first. This vacuum is very heavy and cumbersome. The motorized head is bulky and does not handle well in small spaces or tight corners. It is very difficult to push and my arm is actually sore when I am through. It also squeals very loud when I use it on the carpet. The brush attachment falls off while using it. I am going to bring the vac in for service of these 2 items but I am aggravated that I have to do this with a vac that is only a month old.  Also, while I like not having to use bags with this vac, I must empty the cup on this one about 4-5 times when doing my 1600 sq ft home. (I vacuum every other day.) This just adds to the frustration of using this vacuum. The entire vacuum is large and difficult to use. I cannot vacuum my stairs and let the canister rest because it is too big. I am not a small woman and find the entire vac too akward and my husband who has tried this product as well shares the same opinion. Overall, I am highly disappointed in this product and I would not recommend it.

Title: ughhhhh! bad
Content:
Probaly the only great thing about this thing is that it fits in the shape of your grip, Otherwise it is bad. Negatives:the screen is hard to read, the ear phones are very uncomfortable, chep carriying case, takes too long to shut off, bad volume, some times when I'm going through the playlist and I stop on a song, and it starts in the middle of the song, bad radio connection. I'd rather have no mp3 player at all than have this!!!!!!!!     If you buy this product BAD CHOICE!!!

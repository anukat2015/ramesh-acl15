Title: WOW! This laptop is tha BOMB!
Content:
I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy a store bought netbook or a bulky laptop. I thought with a netbook it's small, compact, lightweight, popular, cute, up to date, blah, blah, blah. I even tried one out at a store, but the darned keys were so small, I was havin trouble testing it out. I went online and checked on Amazon like I always do and to my surprise, this lil beauty was available. NEW! I clicked BUY NOW!! No second thoughts or regrets. I love it. It's fast, and just as lightweight as a netbook. Not as bulky as a laptop and it even fits in my carry all bags. The wireless card picks up signals right away and the ZOOM IN & ZOOM OUT feature with the pinch of my thumb and index finger is just like having an iphone, my next purchase if they keep that up..lol Buy This Laptop!! Peace!

Title: great experience with it so far
Content:
We purchased the heater and had it installed for about a week now.  The installation was very easy and it is actually very light.  We put it on the wall and it blended very well with the rest of the room.  To my surprise, it worked as advertised.  There is a noticeable difference in the room when we have it on.  Granted we are still at the start of the winter here in the Northeast, but so far we have been very happy with it.  We highly recommend it.  By the way, I agree with the lady who said that its surrounding gets to be somewhat hot, but it's not hot enough to form a hazard.

Title: JUNK
Content:
I purchased two of these heaters.  One of them is still working but the temperature up and down didn't work out of the box.  The other one worked fine for 3 months and then it started sparking.  I contacted the company and they sent a new one after I mailed them $12.  The replacement arrived today and IT DOESN'T get warm at all.  I tried to call the company and for every extension I called I got no answer.  I am now waiting for a phone or email response.  I am very upset with these heaters.  I wouldn't  but one!

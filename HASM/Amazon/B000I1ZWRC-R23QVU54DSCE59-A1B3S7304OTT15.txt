Title: Bought to shoot artwork
Content:
After a long five months of debating and research, I finally broke down and bought a XTi. I bought it as an artist looking to take photos of my artwork to make prints out of. 
The XTi is quite easy to use, with simple menus and a logical interface. But it all is irrelevant compared to whether or not the camera makes good images.
I was amazed at the size of the files and the information contained therein. I shot in RAW, then did minimal processing, learning to save my files to TIFF. The resulting print was quite good, and able to be blown up to 24" x 36"
The one drawback is the poor performance of this camera in low light. Even with 1000 watts of light on my artwork, is wasn't enough for those pieces that were darker. That's where knowing a little about photography helped. I took a second series of photos outside on an overcast day, and my photos turned out perfectly. 
there is much more I could say about the camera, as I'm using it for a very specific use. What I will say is that it has proven to be a great investment, one I would heartily recommend to others.

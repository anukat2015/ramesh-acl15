Title: Very nice but don't expect too much!
Content:
I got this coffee maker based on the Amazon reviews and Consumer Reports reviews...
Basically I like this unit.... but.. given the reviews I think I had unrealistic expectations... It makes good coffee and the features work great.. However, I really did not see much improvement in flavor over my old Mr. Coffee unit.  
I like a bold to extra bold cup of coffee... and this unit works well to make a good cup of coffee.  I have no problems pouring water into the unit even though the opening is a little narrow.  Some have complained about the level indicators inside the unit BUT HEY .. just measure the water in the pot and there is no problem... the pot and the unit actually match unlike some coffee makers I have had over the years.  I like the gold filter but you do get some grinds thru to the coffee.  No big deal.. I also use the #4 paper filter with no problems... perfect fit.  The auto timer works well as do the buttons to set the time..  The adjustable heater works well on the low setting so that you don't burn your coffee if you let your coffee stay warm for a short time.  It looks classy and nice and makes good but not delectable coffee.

Title: Lovin' it!
Content:
This is my first SLR... I did a lot of research beforehand, especially through amazon reviews. I played with a few different Rebels, I tried some Nikons... I initially wanted the 40D, but I found that prices for the 50D weren't that much more. The things I love most about this camera: 
speed: 6.3 fps is fast enough to take good action pics of corgis wrestling with collies
ruggedness: it just feels good and sturdy
ergonomics: button placement is good, logical, easy to get to... they just make sense
battery life: I can shoot over a weekend, review pics, delete pics, and still have battery life remaining! 
Sure the pictures can look a bit soft, but in raw mode, it's pretty easy to sharpen. 
I've had this camera for a little over a month now, and I'm very happy with it!

Title: Rebel Yell!
Content:
I love it, I love it, I love it! Upgrade from an Olympus C--755. Bye, bye shutter lag - the bane of my existence. I don't know about histograms and the other techno minutia, but I do know a well composed picture and I'm having so much fun with this camera.
Love the weight, the grip, the menus are clear and mostly intuitive.

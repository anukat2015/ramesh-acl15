Title: Simplicity
Content:
I love that you can plug it into your computer and start listening right away - no programs to install, no PITA formats... nothing.  If you have Media Player, you already have everything you need.  This alone makes it 1000 times better than an iPod.  I hate having Apple programs on my PC anyway.  It's about time manufacturers started making their products work with our computers and not the other way around!!

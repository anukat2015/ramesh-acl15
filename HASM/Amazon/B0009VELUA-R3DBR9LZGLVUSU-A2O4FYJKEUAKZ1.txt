Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
I've gone through 2 of these. They last about a year (with only one use per day) and then stop working. It looks cool, is programable, and the coffee tastes good, but the machine just doesn't last. I wish it had a light underneath so you could see how much coffee is in your mug; once you put your mug under there you can't see the top easily. Also, the part that catches the condensation drips down the back is too small. We had to keep the pot on a kitchen towel because the countertop was always wet.

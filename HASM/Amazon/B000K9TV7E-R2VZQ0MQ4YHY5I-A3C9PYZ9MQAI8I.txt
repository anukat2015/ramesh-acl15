Title: Coffee stains and coffee grounds inside unit
Content:
I couldn't believe it -- when I pulled the coffee maker out of the box, I found coffee stains on the carafe, coffee stains on the inside and outside of the maker, and coffee grounds/coffee residue on the inside filter area.  I have no idea whether this unit was remanufactured or not, but I am quite confident that it has not been washed since it was sent back to Cuisinart.  Really, truly disturbing.

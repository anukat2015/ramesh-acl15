Title: great heater for infant room
Content:
This is a great product. We did a lot of research before buying this heater, as we were concerned about safety. We bought this for our child's nursery because we wanted to keep the nursery warm but not have to heat the whole house as high. I will highlight several points:
1) Customer service is great: I called them with several questions and they answered them all
2) Delivery was fast and installation VERY easy.
3) We plug it into a thermostat so it only heats the room up to what we set it to on the programable thermostat. This works great so we know it will shut off if the room gets over 71 degrees. We also installed a fire detector above the panel just in case as an added precaution.
4) The room we have it in is small, only about 12 ft by 12 ft, so one panel does the job easily.
5) While the panel does get hot to touch, it does not seem hot enough to burn my hand. That said, I would not leave a child that does not know to pull his/her hand away unattended with it on. 
There were several complaints about cracks appearing, etc. Thus far we have not had any cracks, I hope this does not happen to ours. We have been using it for about 1 month and it is working great. But, if things change I will update the review. We did get our first electricity bill and it was barely affected by the use of the heater as far as we could tell.

Title: You'll have to pry it from my cold dead hands....
Content:
It's a lot of money for a vac - I know.  It's worth it.  I was tired of paying $250-400 every 18 months for a bagless upright that would break or spew dust everywhere (even ones with supposed HEPA filters did that - the filter doesn't do much good if the dust can get out other ways).  
I have medium pile carpet and tile.  I have upholstered furniture.  The Callisto does it all.  I have a long-haired cat, and the Callisto gets all the fur she sheds.  I have a baby, and the Callisto gets all the Cheerios she drops.  And it's quiet enough that it doesn't scare the cat or wake the baby.  I can put my face directly in the exhaust and feel no discomfort - no dust is blowing into my eyes.  I bought this from a local dealer.  It came with a 7 year warranty on the motor and 1 year on the body and attachments.

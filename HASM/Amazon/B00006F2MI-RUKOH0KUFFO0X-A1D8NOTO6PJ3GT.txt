Title: Concept is right, but needs refining
Content:
We have owned this coffee grinder/brewer for two years although we DO NOT use the automatic grinder portion. We still grind our beans in an external grinder and add them to the Cuisinart filter basket because;
A) using the Cuisinart automatic grind creates a big mess inside the grinder portion so in order to keep the grinder function working as efficiently as possible, which it is not anyway, so needs to be cleaned between uses. Time lost washing and drying the parts.
B) not all of the ground beans end up in the drip basket after going through the grind process so there is almost 10% loss of ground beans that do not make it out of the grinder mechanism and just stick on the parts, so this adds considerable cost to your coffee.
C) the grinder is extremely LOUD. This thing howls! If you set the automatic timer to go in the morning, you will not need to set your alarm clock (maybe even the neighbors too!!!) You get about 30 seconds of a screaming grinder as this thing kicks off...
Other than those issues the coffee brewer is good. The carafe keeps coffee warm for a couple of hours after it's brewed.

Title: Good Little Heater
Content:
Rec'd product promptly and in good condition.  It's the perfect size for my bedroom, with a slim profile and hi-tech look.  Tested the heater on a cold night and it warmed up my room in no time.  The fan was quiet and the oscillating tower was good at spreading the heat around.  Overall, a good little heater for the price!

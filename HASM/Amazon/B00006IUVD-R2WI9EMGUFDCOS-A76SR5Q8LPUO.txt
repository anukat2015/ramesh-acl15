Title: great coffeemaker when it works
Content:
I've been using this coffeemaker since it came out. I had one for several years when it broke, I loved it so much I told my friend about it and he wanted one too. I purchased 2 of these from Amazon and when they came in both were broken. When you plugged it in it automatically went on. I returned both of them and bought them elsewhere. After several years of use it broke again and I purchased it from Amazon. It worked for about 3 weeks and then stopped working. When you pressed the button to turn it on nothing happened. I just got off the phone with Amazon's customer service and they are sending me a shipping label to return the item. Amazon was very helpful once I explained the situation. The coffeemaker is the best out there for the price but apparently the store that it's coming from is selling damaged goods.

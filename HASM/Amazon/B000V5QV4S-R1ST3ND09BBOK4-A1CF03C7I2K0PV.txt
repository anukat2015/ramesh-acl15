Title: Great Camera in all respects except few flaws
Content:
I've been using this camera for about a year.  Overall it has performed really well.  Dust reduction works great.  After 30D dust problems I can say I have no dust at all after about 12 months of heavy use. I like the live view and the bigger LCD.  However the LCD is not adequate for reviewing sharpness even though it has enough resolution for (Live view) magnification (10x).  It's got to do with the thumbnail Canon uses to display the pictures.  Another gripe is bracketing only goes to -/+2 EV and 3 shots. The print button is still "useless" (dont know why Canon insists on keeping it).  Auto ISO is very limited 400-800 only.  Pictures are usually a bit on the soft side but not a problem if you use Post Processing. Hi Speed shooting works well and I captured some great shots with it. Overall I thinks this is a very good Prosumer camera which could have been even better if Canon had invested some effort to develop the right firmware to overcome some of these issues.

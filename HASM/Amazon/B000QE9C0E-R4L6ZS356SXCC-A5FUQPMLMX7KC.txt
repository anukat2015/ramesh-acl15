Title: This Sucker is Great!
Content:
I was also leery of ordering a vacuum online, but the other reviews are right, this is one great vac! Takes about 15 minutes' worth of easy assembly, VERY light, maneuvers easily, attachments basic and easy-to-use, and the suction is powerful. Definitely more than I expected for the price. Love it!

Title: Works perfectly.
Content:
I've had the heater for about a week now and I am very pleased. The heater is smaller than I thought that it would be and I was concerned about it being able to put out an adequate amount of heat, but this has not been a problem. The small size makes it very portable and unobtrusive. The Lasko754200 puts out more than enough heat to warm or to totally heat up my bedroom, and by "heat up", I do mean throwing the covers off in the middle of the night to escape the inferno. I also use the heater in the bathroom for post shower/bath heat, and it's perfect. The Lasko754200 heats up very quickly and the sides, back, top, and bottom stay cool to the touch. The adjustable thermostat works well, unlike many units with which you change the thermostat and your results are way too cold, way too hot, or just not right. For the money, I think that anyone would be pleased with this unit.

Title: Terrible customer service
Content:
Bought this in April-quit working in September.  I called customer service and they said it was under warranty and they would replace it and I would have a new one in 2 weeks.  Sent me a label to return the broken unit. Now almost 2 months later I'm told it's still backordered and they have no idea when I will recieve it.  Asked for a full refund, and after talking to 3 service reps was told they would issue a refund if I sent them a copy of the receipt.  Refund will take 3-5 WEEKS!  I asked what would I get quicker, a new unit or the refund and of course they have no idea.  Don't buy this unless you're willing to deal with horrible customer service.  Upon reading other reviews of this item, it's clearly a good idea but has a lot of problems.  On top of that if and when it breaks good luck dealing with customer service.

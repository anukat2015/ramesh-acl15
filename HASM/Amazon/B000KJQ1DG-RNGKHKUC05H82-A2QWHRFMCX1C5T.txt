Title: As Usual A Great Nikon
Content:
I bought this camera after waiting a long time to go digital.  I am not a professional photographer, so I don't use a lot of the "higher tech" features.  However, I found this camera to be very user friendly and the price is definitely right for an SLR. 
I don't like to lug around a big camera, so the size of the Nikon D40 is perfect to carry in a small camera bag or in a mini bag inside a purse, which is great plus on a vacation.
If you've been waiting to go digital, then the Nikon D40 is a great place to start.

Title: Warranty limitation with damaged pixels
Content:
Warranty limitations of Toshiba were created to avoid change or repair one laptop if it has few bad or damaged pixels (dead black pixels, always white or colored pixels...). I did not know this when I bought my laptop and I am thinking never more buying one by Internet (it is better see in the store if it has some damaged pixels)
I am an international customer.  I bought this Toshiba from Amazon and I am out of US in this moment.  I have used a lot of HP computers without problems and this was the first time I selected a computer of other brand.  I did this because of the "Toshiba international warranty" - [..]
But my computer has an UGLY white point in the screen.  I bought it for photo and video processing and I am very disapointed.  You can read a lot of information (other customers with the same problem) searching in google toshiba dead pixels.  The computer performance is good (4.9 Vista score) but this problem with the screen caused my laptop to be a waste of money...  BE CAREFULL BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER FEW DAMAGED PIXELS TO BE ACCEPTABLE!!!

Title: too thin!
Content:
i never actually purchased this product but i have numerous friends who have. yes it is thinner than a pencil and i can see the highlights of something being thin however ipod nano goes too far.
all of my friends that have put other types of ipods have been able to put them in their pockets without problems but my friends who have got ipod nanos have put them in their pockets and after a couple of times doing so it was so thin that they snapped in their pockets (apple couldn't give them refunds). i suggest the ipod mini because it is virtually the same size but thicker so they wont snap.

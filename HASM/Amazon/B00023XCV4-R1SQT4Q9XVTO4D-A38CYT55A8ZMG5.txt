Title: Worth the price
Content:
I bought our 12 cup electric percolator 12 months ago.  I've been happy with it basically.  There have been a few times I thought I'd get a golden brown cup of coffee after brewing, only to pour out a cup of hot water.  Evidently I didn't have the stem solidly seated into the hole in the bottom.  My bad!  
The black plastic dome on the lid cracked in half after one month.  It's not bothering anything, just looks like heck.
So (based on user stupidity) nine times out of ten it delivers rich, hot coffee.  The basket is easy to clean, I clean out the vessel monthly with automatic dishwasher crystals (Electrosol).  After soaking for one hour - then a little gentle scrubbing with a 3M pad, the interior (plus the basket) looks brand new.   
After reading bad reviews on Farberware percolators (which I thought were better) I have come to the conclusion that I have the best coffee pot for the money and it's still a workhorse, even with its cracked nob.  
Go for it!

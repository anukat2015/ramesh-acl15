Title: To All Those Ip*d Fanboys, Stop Writing Reviews
Content:
This player is great. Its not perfect, but its totally satisfactory.  The software need a tiny bit of work plus needs more codec support, but simply use WinAVI and you wont have any problems with video.  Other than that its a beautiful durable piece of hardware, unlike the ip*d that will totally shatter from a 1 or 2 foot drop.  plus the screen is beautiful, a little higher resolution would have been nice.  Plus all those people who complain that the wireless in horrible, how could a free (and with the ip*d you wont get anything for free or "built In") feature be a minus.  Its affective plus in the newer firmware versions it will definitely have much more functionality.  I'm not an Apple Hater, ive owned an ipod 5th gen and i was totally unhappy.  Video's were hard to watch and there were very little converters out there.  But its funny how this .5 inch increase in screen size is a HUGE improvement, i was truly amazed by how much bigger it looked.  Ive had alot of experience with PVP and DAP's(Personal Video Players and Digital Audio Players) and i follow these things alot.  Ive owned an Ipod 5th Gen, Zen Vision M(also a great buy btw for the price and great video codec) a Microsoft Zune, and have played with the Toshiba Gigabeat a lot.  My favorite thing about the zune is its great interface(GUI)  Its amazing and really catches the users attention.  Now dont get me wrong, the ipod is a great player, but it leaves much to be desired.

Title: Coffee maker
Content:
This coffeemaker is great, very economical as it shuts off after it is finished brewing and the coffee stays HOT for hours in the urn.  No 'burner' to go bad after years of use.  The only problem we have had is if the filter isn't sitting perfectly right in the basket and the water misses going through it, the water overflows onto the counter,etc.  We will purchase a gold filter (if cuisinart makes one for this model).  So far, all the specs I've seen for the gold filters do not include this model so I sent a message to the company.  It should come with one for the price...and the economics.

Title: Great Ipod
Content:
Bought this ipod for a boomer-aged friend (after getting one for myself). He absolutely loves it! Considering he never owned an ipod before, he quickly learned to navigate the unit and easily was able to download songs. Great item for the price. Never believed in buying refurbished items, so spend a few dollars more and buy the new item.

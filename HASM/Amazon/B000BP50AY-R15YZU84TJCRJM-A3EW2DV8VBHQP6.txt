Title: Very easy to load music!
Content:
I bought this MP3 player first for myself, and then for my two teenage children who had been asking me for an "IPod" for so long, but I didn't want to spend that much money. Well, I'm glad I bought these ones. The value is great, and you load the songs via Windows Media Player which is very easy to do. The sound quality is very good also. I love the arm strap which works great for exercising and running. I can highly recommend this unit!

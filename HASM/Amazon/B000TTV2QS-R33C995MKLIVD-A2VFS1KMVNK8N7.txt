Title: Quiet and heats great
Content:
Our family room has high ceilings and is hard to get it warm.  This heater has been an excellent choice for keeping the TV-watching area cozy.   We love the oscillation, and the fact that we can use either a high or low heat setting.  The timer is also useful to make sure we don't leave it on overnight.  And although I thought the remote control was patently ridiculous, it turns out to be very useful for adjusting the temp when it gets too warm.  We were worried about noise, since our last heater was a radiant parabola style.  We needn't have worried.  It's very quiet, and the oscillating fan design does so much better a job of getting heat to all parts of the couch area.
We got the next model up, the one on a pedestal, for our young adult son's bachelor pad, and it allows him to be comfortable without the heat on in the middle of winter.  
This is a great choice for heating a small room or part of a room.

Title: Very impressive little heater
Content:
I have a 24x24 garage with 10 feet ceilings.  I did exactly as the last review did, mount it on the ceiling about four feet off the wall.  Don't expect this to heat your space quickly.  It works quite slowly and you can't really notice the heat, which I think is great.  I turned it on at 4am in the morning and the garage temp was 40 degrees.  After about 15 minutes, temp was up to 43 degrees.  In about an hour it was up to 52 degrees and after 90 minutes it was up to 60 degrees.  This unit is quality built and extremely quiet.  It lacks the bell and whistle but is very inexpensive compared to other units.  It only requires 240 volts and 20 amp breakers, all standard in the home. ( the other heaters require 30 amp breaker which requires more cost).  it also come with a cord which save you another $40 over the other models.  I highly recommended this unit as it compares well with the 5000 watt units with out all the extra cost.  Plus if you want it to heat up  a small area in the garage a little quicker then go buy a $40 floor heater and you will have the best of both worlds.  Enjoy !

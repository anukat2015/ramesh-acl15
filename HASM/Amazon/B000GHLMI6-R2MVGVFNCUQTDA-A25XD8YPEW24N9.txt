Title: Hamilton Brew Station
Content:
Makes great coffee and the self contained holding tank is great. The only issues I have, one is my oversite, but the fact that it is almost impossible to see or tell how much coffee remains in the uniy is an issue. The other oversite, is most other coffee makers all have clockes and timers these days. I overlooked the fact that there is not one on this model. I just bought an external timer, but it still needs to be pointed out better in the sales descripition.

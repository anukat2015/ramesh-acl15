Title: it heats quite well and saves money too!
Content:
i bought this heater a month ago and, used it for allmost a whole month. my energy bill was $187.34 dollars (u.s.a. funds) less then the same time last year! i use this heater in both the largest and, second largest rooms in the house and it heated both rooms very well. now, to the person who complain that the conformt-temp light on their unit did not work. contact amazon.com's cosumtor service about your problem; they will exchange it for you. it sounds like this flaw occured at the factory or, in shipping. as for the bad smell that the heater gives off the first time you use it. if you read the note wraped around the cord or, the owners manual; the manufacturer tells you about this. i put the heater in a room and open the window then, i closed the door and, let it run about an hour. that ended the smell problem. someone posted a consumer alert. whom ever posted this "alert" did not state which agency issued this "alert." with no reference this "alert" cannot be verifed by us shoppers. please, state the source for this alert. as for a a wire sticking out of the unit... always ckeck over any product before using it for the first time! we have all been told  this over and over!

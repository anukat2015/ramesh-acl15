Title: Does a good job
Content:
The Eureka 3684F Pet Lover Mighty Mite is a fine little vacuum.  Does not take up much room, does floors very well, I have not used the pet brush attachment as I do not have a pet, but I did attach it and it has a very strong brushing action.  I also like the HEPA filter, no dust in the exaust. Has a nice long cord.

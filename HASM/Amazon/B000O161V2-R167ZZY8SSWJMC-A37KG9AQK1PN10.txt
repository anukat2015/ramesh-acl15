Title: 10.2 Million Reasons To Love This Camera
Content:
This is a high-quality digital camera.
Pros:
- 10.2 megapixel resolution
- Nikon quality
- reasonably priced
- LCD screen is large and bright
- Lithium battery charges quickly and lasts
Cons:
- Full functionality is limited to AF-S lenses (still, they are very nice lenses and come in a reasonable variety)
- Manual control is shared on a single dial, unlike fancier (if pricier) Nikon camera bodies which have separate dials for shutter speed and aperture.
Marketing material carries on about "on camera" editing, which is kinda neat (the color balance, in particular seems useful), but for my part, I prefer editing digital images on the computer.

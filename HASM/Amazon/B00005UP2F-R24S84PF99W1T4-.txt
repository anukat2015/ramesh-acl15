Title: Excellent cleaning and terrible cleanup
Content:
Very excellent cleaning performance, as almost all reviewers agree.After each use cleaning a small home, the filter is completely clogged with dust and hair and tiny powder that might be residue from carpet cleaning.  As others have said, cleaning this is a terrible chore.  I take it outdoors because I do not want the dust flying around after I just cleaned.  &quot;Shaking&quot; the filter does not clean it.  I have to scrape the folds of the filter with a hair pick to remove the compacted dust.  It is really unpleasant and also gets me dirty.  I keep using it because it cleans so well.There is a large round button to push to retract the cord.  After the first few times I used it, this button refused to spring back up, so the cord does not stay extended.  Now, each time I use it I wrestle with the machine for a good 5-10 minutes trying to get the cord-retract button to come up so the cord will not retract while I clean.  I have also experienced the electric shocks or pokes others mentioned, when I grab the handle on the metal part, which is very easy to do.  Overall, I think this cleaning system should be put into a much better designed unit.

Title: Good camera produce quality photos but price...
Content:
I bought this camera from Amazon & returned it back after two weeks because it failed to accept CF cards (only accepts SDHC cards) with full refund including shipping fees for both ways.
In general, this is a great CROP 1.5x camera in the field. It produces very fine and clean quality photos and video(with good optical lenses, I always use fix lenses); really amazing if you do video - very high quality! easier to control the video mode (if compare to other models of Nikon or Canon, even the 5D mark II).
The only two things i am not so happy with: 
1) the ISO sensitivity - it's true that the ISO sensitivity is better & an improvement if compare to previous models (D200, D300) - however, it doesn't meet my expectations for $1.8K value camera. with ISO over 800, you  start seeing noises. If you don't like noises, it's better option to buy D700 or any full-frame cameras.
2)The price - I bought it $1800 on Amazon. It seems Nikon get too much from a 1.5x CROP camera. I personally think this is not a good price for the value. I returned the camera after two weeks & will save some extra to buy the D700 instead.

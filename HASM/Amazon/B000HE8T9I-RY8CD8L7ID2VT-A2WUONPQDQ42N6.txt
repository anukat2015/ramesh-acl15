Title: So far so good
Content:
I purchased this vac about a month ago, and so far it has performed as advertised.  I, too, was considering the twice as expensive Dyson, but upon comparing features, I thought I would give the Infinity a try.  A nice feature which the Dyson does not have is the headlight.  It's really bright and useful in a shaded room.  Cleaning is pretty easy, although claims of no filters to clog are a bit exaggerated.  The cylindrical screen in the center of the filter compartment gets pretty dirty and does need cleaning regularly to maintain suction.  Noise level is on par with the Dyson, and is fairly quiet considering the suction.  I did notice that the plastic parts seem not as quality as the Dyson, but for half the price you know they had to economize somewhere.  One last thing, the pull out handle and hose assembly is shorter than expected.  If you need a longer reach hose, I'd recommend the red model, NV31.  All in all, I'm pleased with this purchase.

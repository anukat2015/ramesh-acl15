Title: Too good to be true, you get what ou pay for!!
Content:
I just recieved my Breville maker, unfortunately you get what you pay for.  It had several scratches all over, the area where you place the k-cup had residule coffee from the previous user on it, the cord is not retractable like the new ones, and there was a 4inch crack on the back of the unit, which I fear they will tell me it is "cosmetic".  The several items which others did not recieve I did not too; the my k-cup with spoon, and the filter.
I emailed for a "RMA" for an exhange, will keep ypu posted...

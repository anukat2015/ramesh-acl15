Title: What a great vacuum!
Content:
This is a great vacuum!  In fact, it's so great that I bought it again after I damaged my first one. Don't try to vacuum up plant dirt that is even slightly damp!  It will ruin your vacuum.  After I vacuumed the plant dirt, it worked intermittently.  It mostly hurt the electronics on the handle.  Anyway...now that my second Hoover WindTunnel arrived in just 4 days after ordering, I love it again. I had forgotten just how good it works:  great suction and so easy to clean....just rinse and let dry and I  love that there are no messy bags to deal with.

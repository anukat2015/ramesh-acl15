Title: warm all winter
Content:
I live in a large home with tall ceilings and heating the whole house can be quite expensive. I got this heater to heat up a reasonable sized room, mainly my bedroom and I can also move it into the living room.
The little heater puts out a good heat, warm and cozy (not intense) that can make a chilly room, quite warm and comfortable.
I can leave the heater on all night, in my bedroom, at the 3 setting and the thermostat works well enough to ensure that the room maintains a steady heat.
It is not a good heater if you want to get up real close when its a really cold day, and you just want to chill out your feet, but if you leave it on for an hour for a good sized room, it can maintain a good heat. For this I give it a 4 rating.

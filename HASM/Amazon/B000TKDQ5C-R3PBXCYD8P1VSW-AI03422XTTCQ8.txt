Title: Excellent product at great price
Content:
Couldn't ask for more. An excellent product in compact size and provides the necessary heating. The body might seem made of flimsy plastic at first but it is quite robust and does the job perfectly.
A single unit probably covers about 200-300sq ft of floor space. Go for it. You wont go wrong.
My only concern was around the amount of power this seems to draw. I live in a 50 yr old Manhattan building and the power outlet gets terribly hot even at the low power setting. I run the a/c during summers from the same outlet without any issues so I think this unit needs some good electrical wiring in the house.

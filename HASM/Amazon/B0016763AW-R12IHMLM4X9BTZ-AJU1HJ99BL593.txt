Title: Good bang for the buck
Content:
I have the 8gb version of this player and so far I've had no problems.  
For the money, you really can't go wrong with the amount of storage you get as you'd pay close to the same price for other players with half that amount.  
That said, I think the player is VERY easy to use.  Navigation is easy and the interface is very polished.  Photo resolution is pretty sharp and not pixelated. Movies are a sort of a pain because the conversion program hardly recognizes any formats.  I found MPEG1 video a safe bet for converting the movies.  So if you have AVI or mpeg4, convert them to MPEG1 and then to the player's format. 
The only thing I REALLY didn't like about the player is that it didn't get loud enough.  No, I'm not deaf, I just like my music loud.  Rock is not supposed to be limited to a 'gentle' listening volume.  There is a volume limit feature but even with it off, I still hear my mp3s played half way loud when turned all the way up .  
You have plenty of different equalizer options and even one you can customize on your own.  That in itself sounds great-  the sound is very rich and full with crystal clear highs and heavy lows; but with an alternate decent pair of headphones.
To sum up, this is a good, solid player; lots of features, lots of room (8gb version) and very easy to use.  It just doesn't rock as loud as I'd like.

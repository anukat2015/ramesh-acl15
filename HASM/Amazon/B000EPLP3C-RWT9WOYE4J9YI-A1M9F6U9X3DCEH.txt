Title: Butt Ugly
Content:
It really looks cheap.  Made from what looks like plastic.  Strange corners.  A big boxy feel.  Feels empty, not a solid, dense feel.  It surely looks better in the pictures; but don't be fooled, in real life it is ugly.
The screen is bigger but the resolution is just 320x240, like your iPod.  So why all the advertisement about the bigger screen?  Is it becuase they couldn't build something sleek and sexy?
The click wheel isn't a wheel at all - it is four buttons: up, down, left, right.  You want to scroll down?  Push and hold the down butten.  Looks like an iPod thumb twirler but actually just buttons.
Parents.  Don't surpise your kids with one of these, they will only be embarrassed.
Disclaimer: I own a new iPod Shuffe 2G.  I checked the Zune out is an electronics store; my 13 y.o. son laughed when he first realized the click wheel was four buttons.

Title: Coffee shouldn't taste this good
Content:
We have experienced no problems with the steam getting into the clock as a few other posters have said. However, you can see the steam rising around it. All we do to alleviate this issue is turn the pot so the handle is directly below the clock. Overall, this coffee maker is awesome. It makes delicious coffee. It taste good even after reheating about 3 times. GET THIS COFFEE MAKER!

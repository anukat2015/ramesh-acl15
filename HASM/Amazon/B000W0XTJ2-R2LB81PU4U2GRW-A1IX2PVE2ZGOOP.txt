Title: Could be better, but great wrt its price
Content:
The battery is big and its volume goes further outside of the case of the tablet PC. The fingerprint reader is on the screen and sometimes unintentionally one can press on it. This makes it harder to use when the screen is rotated 180 degrees to work in "real book" mode. The fingerprint reader should be placed which won't be a problem while using it as "real book".
Other than these 2 disadvantages, it is a satisfying product with respect to its price. If you plan to buy a PC just to read, e-mail or make small edits while traveling, then buy an ultra small PC like Samsung or Sony has.

Title: iPod Nano
Content:
I give this a 5 star rating.  This was a Christmas gift for my 15 year old Granddaughter.  She flipped when she opened the package.  I do not think it has left her hand since.  
I personally think all iPods are over priced, but it was worth the look on her face when she saw it.

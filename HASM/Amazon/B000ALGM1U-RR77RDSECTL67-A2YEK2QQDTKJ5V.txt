Title: Godd for the money
Content:
Not bad at all. The instructions weren't even close for wire labels on my (granted, quite old) thermostat. However, I still managed to get it right after reading some statements about what things NOT to do. Just read it and take your time. After I got it hooked up, it worked awesome, and the batteries are really easy to change. One happy customer.

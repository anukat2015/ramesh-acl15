Title: Bunn's the One!
Content:
If you want a great cup of coffee fast and silently, this is the brewer for you.  No other home coffee makers work like the Bunn machines do.  A stainless steel reservoir keeps water at the correct brewing temperature at all times, so when you want some coffee, just pour in the amount of cold water corresponding to the amount of coffee desired and instantly steaming hot coffee starts to fill the thermal caraffe.  The caraffe keeps the coffee hot for quite a while with no warming burner so your coffee doesn't cook into "Tire Shop Coffee". I am spoiled with the taste of Seattle's Best and Starbucks Coffee which I usually use, but tried some "over the counter" grocery store coffee and found that the brewer even made that taste good.  The secret, I think is the brewing temperature the machine achieves extracts the best out of the coffee grounds.

Title: Pleased with my purchase - EOS20D
Content:
I purchased this camera after using the EOS 10D and was very pleased with the price and value for money, it was shipped promptly as advised by Amazon. I have used the camera professionaly and it has met or exceeded my needs and expectations on all occassions. [...]
It can be very easy to use in the fully automatic mode, and my son uses same to take pictures also, with great results.
I would recommend this camera without reservation, well done Canon.

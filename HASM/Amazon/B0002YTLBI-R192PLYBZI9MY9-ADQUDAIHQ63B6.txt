Title: great replacement heater
Content:
I purchased this as a replacement built in heater in our 2 bedroom condo. This heater has multiple wiring options to allow for 220v or 110v.  Since our heaters were wired for 220 I was able to follow the directions in the box and have this heater up and running in about half an hour.  The old heater was always setting off the smoke alarm this one has been fantastic.

Title: electric space heater
Content:
The product itself is really pretty. However, it didn't have the front door like my mom's nor does it have the turbo blower like my mom's. The door was a purely aesthetic desire on my behalf. However, the lack of the turbo blower does make a difference in how quickly the device warms a room. Still, overall, it has served its general purpose for me quite well. I will make it a point to look for more specifics next time though.

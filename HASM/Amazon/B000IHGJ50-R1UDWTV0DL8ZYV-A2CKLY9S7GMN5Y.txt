Title: Older is sometimes better (even with tech products)
Content:
After making the disastrous investment in a 4th generation, I wound up right back purchasing the product I had beforehand in the 2G. My previous one took about 2 years worth of punishment before finally calling it a day. I am a competitive runner in marathons and 5 K's and I also have the tendency to be hard on things, so I was not at all distraught over it finally giving out on me. 
OK, now I will discuss the particulars. If you are an athlete, you really can't go wrong with this device. Simple, portable, good sound quality, and damn near indestructible from the punishment I inflicted on mine. The ear buds that come with the device I quickly replaced as they do not seem to stay in for me well when I am on the move, But that would be the only area I would have to criticize as far as functionality. 
The only other major hindrance is obviously the huge price jump. I quickly found out the reason for this after having the misfortune of purchasing a 4th generation. To put it mildly, it sucks beyond all imagination. After you use one of those for all of an hour, you will not feel nearly as bad about spending the extra money on one of these. I lack colorful enough adjectives (short of profanity) to truly describe how much hatred and contempt I have for apple by trying to pawn off the 4th generation on the athletic community. Seriously, what were they thinking? 
OK, rant officially over. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a product that delivers the goods without all the frills (and headaches), the 2nd generation is a home run.

Title: Great camera!
Content:
Everything considered there's isn't a better DSLR out there for the $$. Sure there are cheaper and more expensive models. But for most beginners and even semi professionals the XSi has most of what you need. It's light, feature packed, has great resolution and the button layout is very nice. 
Again you could spend more money, but would you use those features? Save your money for lenses. For me, at this point in the game getting good lenses is where my money needs to go. Once the lens collection is where it needs to be then I can consider a more robust camera body like the 50D or something similar.
Great camera, good luck!

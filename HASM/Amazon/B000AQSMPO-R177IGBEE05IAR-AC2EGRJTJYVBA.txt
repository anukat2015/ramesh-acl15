Title: Great coffee maker!!  Great tea maker too!!
Content:
Great coffee maker that makes a good cup of coffee and a good cup of tea.  If you're exceptionally picky about your coffee, you might be disappointed since it does not rival a well-made fresh ground cup of joe, but the Keurig allows you to brew a good cup of coffee and tailor it to your specific tastes.  My wife likes decaf and I like strong caffeinated coffee, so this offers the ability to make everyone happy.  The selection of k-cups for both tea and coffee is much better than other single cup systems.  The coffee from Timothy's is my favorite, especially the ultra dark roasts.  The other plus for this unit over the other pod systems is that you can purchase a small filter which allows you to use your OWN custom ground coffee and blends.  Good selection of teas from Twinings and Celestial Seasonings.  System brews a good cup of tea that is smotth and not bitter.  The downside is that we haven't found a good local source and have had to buy from the internet from both Amazon and Ebay.   Ebay allows you to buy individual k-cups so that you can sample different blends and brands before you buy the big boxes.   Local stores have just a few brands and don't reflect the much larger variety available for the Keurig system vice the other pod systems.  We're glad we bought this unit!!

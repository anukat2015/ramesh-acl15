Title: Simple and convenient.
Content:
I recently bought this coffee maker and am impressed with what I got for the money. It's utterly simple to use and it's basic, a nice difference from the expensive and complex machines out there. I'm impressed. If you want to fill up your travel mug, it's perfect because that's what it seems meant for. It comes with a travel mug. Anyway, I've only had it for a couple of weeks, and can offer just two possible things worth considering: First, for some reason you have to unplug the cord from your outlet once the coffee is done. That has taken some getting used to. Second, once the coffee seems done, I have to put a coffee cup in place of the travel mug to catch drips. There is a removable drip tray, and I'm still getting used to figuring out when it's done and when I can pull the travel mug out from under the drip-thing. So the price is right, it comes with a permanent filter so buying paper filters isn't necessary, and it's simple, looks nice and is easy to use. So far I really like how it has simplified my life. The best part is that I was able to throw out my Cuisinart piece of expensive coffee-maker junk.

Title: Do not buy an Oxygen Vacuum
Content:
We purchased an Electrolux Oxygen Vacuum Cleaner because it was top rated by Consumer Reports. Ours arrived with a faulty cord reel. 
We found out that Eureka had purchased Electrolux. Eureka does not pay technicians enough to perform warranty work, and all but one warranty repair center in our region (Upstate New York) declined to do warranty work on our machine. It took over 6 months to get a replacement cord reel and have it repaired. Eureka obviously does not fill repair shop orders promptly either!
Then the main circuit board, which is in the handle, shorted out, the machine would turn on but the power head did not work and the machine would not turn off. Luckily, our technician had one on hand and it was an easy repair. But -- the exact same thing happened again. Our vacuum cleaner has again been in the shop over a month now, with no repair in sight. 
To rub salt in the wound: I sent Electrolux customer service an email. I got an automated response promising an answer within 3 business days. No response. So I sent a letter via USPS to Electrolux customer service. No response. It does seem that they would at least be polite enough to write back and tell me it is my own fault for purchasing a Eureka product!
I should say the cleaner worked well when it worked. However, if you purchase one and something goes wrong with it just buy a new different brand vacuum cleaner! Forget having it repaired.Electrolux EL 7020B Oxy3 Ultra Canister VacuumFactory-Refurbished Electrolux Oxygen 3 Ultra Canister Vacuum EL7020B

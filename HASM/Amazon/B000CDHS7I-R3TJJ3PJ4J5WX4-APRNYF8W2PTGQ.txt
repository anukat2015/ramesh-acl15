Title: Like a little Lemon for your Coffee?
Content:
On the up side, this unit (a) has a thermal carafe, which is getting harder to find in this era of single-mug coffee makers, (b) looks nice, and (c) has a reservoir that can be filled with relative ease.
On the down side, this unit (a) easily gets bubbles in the fill level, making it tough to tell how much you've put in, (b) is very difficult to pour the last cup or so out of the carafe, due to a shape that essentially requires you to invert the pot to get the last bits out, and (c) has, based on the reviews here and our own experience, a flaky set of water level sensors that on a lot of units malfunction, causing the maker to refuse to brew anything because it thinks there's no water in the reservoir.
We're trying a few suggestions to resolve (c), in case it's not an actually flaky chip, but I think it's time to pull our old Mr Coffee out of storage and rely on that again.  Disappointing.

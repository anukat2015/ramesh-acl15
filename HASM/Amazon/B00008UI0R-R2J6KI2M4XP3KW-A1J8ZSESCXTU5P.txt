Title: Good vac but one major drawback
Content:
I clean for a living so a good sucking, light and maneuverable vacuum was what I was looking for.  This canister has great suction and is fairly light but maneuverability is not good.  The problem is with the powerhead. IT DOES NOT SWIVEL.  If all you were cleaning was wide open carpeted areas than this is the vacuum for you.  If you need to get around in tight spaces and legs of furniture you will not be happy with this vacuum because to do a thorough job you are going to have to move furniture to clean the area.  Not only is the powerhead non swiveling it is heavy and very wide also making it hard to get in those tight spaces. Plus the head is rather thick heightwise making it also impossible to get under some furniture. The bare floor brush that comes with this vacuum is great.  It is very wide but it swivels just wonderfully and cleaning in tight spaces with it - especially bathrooms - is not a problem.  If Hoover comes out with a thinner, swivel powerhead in the future I will be the first to buy it.

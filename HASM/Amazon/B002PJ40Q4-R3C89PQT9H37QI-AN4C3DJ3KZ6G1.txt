Title: great purchase
Content:
For the price, this camera is perfect for beginners.
Pros: shutter speed, simple menu and picture modes, cool color-red, battery type AA (available everywhere, be sure to use eneloop), size (slightly smaller than other SLRs), many options in menu, video capability.
Cons: Still have to find one.
some customers mentioned that this camera is a battery guzzler but it's not that bad if you use eneloop or any other Lithium battery.

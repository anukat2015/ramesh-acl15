Title: Not All It's Brewed To Be
Content:
We purchased our Kuerig B60 Special Editon on the recommendation of several others who had had their's a while.  It works fine, the way it is designed and engineered to do so, and easy to maintain.  However we returned it after just a few days, and at least two dozen run throughs.  We did not like the the finished product.  The coffee(s), and tea, tasted "thin" and somewhat "scorched".  Also there was an aroma of "burned" plastic, in the air, and in the cup.  We thought maybe it is the "new car smell" syndrome, but it it not diminish with repeated use.  The coffee is prepared with,I think, too much heat (187-192 degrees), under presure, too quickly.  We used the sample cups, and our own coffee with the wire mesh basket.  No comparison to slow drip, or French press.  Moreover, we were unable to reach a representative of Kuerig by phone several times (recorded message said call volume was high and to call back later), and email inquiries went unanswered.  That in itself raised a red flag.  It is a great idea (minus the "un-green" disposable cups), and fun for house guests, but not for those who really enjoy great tasting coffee.

Title: The best canister vacuum I've ever used!!
Content:
The Kenmore Progressive Canister is one of the best canister vacuums I've ever used!  I clean houses for a living and at one of the houses I work at they have me use this vacuum.  The house is approx. 4,000 sq. ft. and I use this vacuum on the entire house once every week and I have been for 4 years now. The floors in the house consist of hard wood, flagstone and carpet. This vacuum has always worked great for all the floors.  
The one thing that is a bummer is that the hard floor attachment that has short bristles wears out over time on the uneven flagstone section of the foor in their home.  This problem is not the fault of the product just the rough floor in their home and it is easily resolved buy repacing that attachment every six months to a year which can be special ordered through the company. However, if your floors aren't made up of rough, uneven flagstone then I don't think you will ever encounter a problem with the attachment.
This vacuum is also fairly light weight and for my 5'1" frame I can easily get it around and up large flights of stairs. I love all the attachments, some of which rotate to get in those hard to reach corners. There is something for everything.
I cant say enough good stuff about this vacuum.  It really is great.  I am going to get one as soon as I have the $$$ because I'm sick of sweeping all my wood floors and blowing dust and dog hair all over my new baby.

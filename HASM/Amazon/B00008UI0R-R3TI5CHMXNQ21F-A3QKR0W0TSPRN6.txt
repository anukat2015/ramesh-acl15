Title: Love this vacuum - as much as one CAN love a vacuum.
Content:
After many weeks of vacuum cleaner research through both Consumer Reports and the reading of product reviews on various sites (Amazon.com included), I finally took the leap and purchased the Hoover S3765-040. It is terrific! To see what has come out of my carpeting when I thought we were reasonably clean people has been quite eye opening. It is powerful, efficient and thorough. Changing out the various tools is extremely easy and they operate very well. I do agree with other reviewers that it would be handy if the dust bin held a bit more.
I find that it cleans carpeting as well as it does hardwood floors. Switching between the two is very easy as is adjusting the suction strength. I find that I use different strengths between hard surfaces and carpeting. All controls are right at your finger tips. 
Although I have never owned a canister vac before, I am very pleased I made the change from an upright. This vacuum gets a big grin and two thumbs up from me!

Title: Disappointed with this camera
Content:
I have played with the new Digital Rebel XT for a day now and I am growing more and more diappointed with it. I had a Powershot Pro1 and I thought the Rebel XT was going to be an upgrade from the Pro1. So far I have taken over two hundred pictures, side by side, using both the XT and the Pro1. For each picture I used the same settings within the choosable range for both cameras. I have taken pictures in the evening, in the night when the light is very dim, and in a sunny morning in the outside. I set the focal length at 200 mm on the Pro1 and 130 mm on the XT, which were almost exactly equivalent. After I took the pictures I came inside and open them with Microsoft Digital Image Pro to compare side by side the pictures of the same objects taken by the two cameras. Without fail, when auto focus was used for both cameras, the Pro1 produced much sharper images and a much better depth of field. When I switched to manual focus, though, the XT did produce razor sharp image with full details. I am impressed with the speed of the Rebel XT as compared to the Pro1. But I do not want to focus manually all the time. My decision is to stick with my Pro1 and return the XT tomorrow.  One word to the Canon engineers, finally. You guys are idiots, wasting such a good camera with such a lousy auto focus accuracy.

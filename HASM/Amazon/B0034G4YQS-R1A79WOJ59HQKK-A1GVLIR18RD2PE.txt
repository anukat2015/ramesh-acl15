Title: Gateway NV7923u
Content:
I bought this Laptop from Amazon last Monday and paid the $20 for 2 day shipping.  Well I got it the next day and I didn't even have to pay the $40 for next day delivery.  On top of that, there was a lot of snow on the ground and lots of business' were closed that day, which I was surprised I got it.  As for the laptop, I like it a lot.  I have been using a 15 inch HP Pavilion and it's going to take a while to get used to the setup of this keyboard and Win7, but I'll get there.  It is way fast and I like the number pad on it.  The only bad thing about this so far I have found is the power cord comes out of it really easy, like if I move it from one place to another, I have to make sure it's still plugged in, and the second so far is that it detects my wireless network really slow when I open it up to use it.  It takes about a minute or two, and I think if it sees my wireless network from previous use, it shouldn't have to detect it again.  That's all for now.

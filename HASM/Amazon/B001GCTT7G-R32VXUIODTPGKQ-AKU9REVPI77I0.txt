Title: Don't wait any longer, this is the Mac laptop you have been waiting for.
Content:
Faster, lighter and stronger for starters. The backlit keyboard on the 2.4 GHz is great! The larger glass trackpad is amazing! The LED screen is very bright (completely adjustable) and comes on instantly from sleep. The new aluminum unibody case is solid, when you pick it up you can really tell the difference. The new integrated video card is noticeably faster than the previous model. Running Windows in Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac (Intel Mac) makes this laptop the only computer you will need, capable of running any Mac & Windows software, this comes in handy if you are switching from a PC or developing across platforms. I've had many laptops (personal and from work) and this one is the only one that I've ever felt was worth every penny. I highly recommend it!

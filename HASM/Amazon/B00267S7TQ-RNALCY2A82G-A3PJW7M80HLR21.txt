Title: Superior Camera
Content:
After reading a lot of the other reveiws, I decided to wing it and purchase the D5000. One mentioned no AF motor.....this camera comes standard with AF built on more than 12 points of reference. I received this camera this morning, put it together, charged the battery, READ THE MANUAL, and then took it to the ball field for a trial run. The picture quality is, to me, second to none. After taking more than 250 action pictures in a two hour period, the battery life is still strong, every image is crystal clear and ability to see with clarity down to the hairs blowing in the wind. I recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great investment in an awesome Digital cam.

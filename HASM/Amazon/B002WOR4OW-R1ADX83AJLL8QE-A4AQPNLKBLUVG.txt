Title: Gets a bit heated...
Content:
I purchased this laptop before it was released based on its predecessor and recent upgrades. Its arrived in pristine condition, and has been able to handle anything i can throw at it. Only issue is with the one exhaust it tends to get a bit hot when not sitting on a flat surface, but has never overheated. Other than that, a great laptop!

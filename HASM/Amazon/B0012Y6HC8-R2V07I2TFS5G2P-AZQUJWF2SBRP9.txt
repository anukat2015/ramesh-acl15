Title: Exceeded my expectations.
Content:
My first dSLR purchase, but I come with a strong analog photographic background (medium- and large-format photography).  
The XSI is very nice.  It is nice and light-weight, great image quality, and is snappy in operation.  I couldn't ask for much more (well maybe in-body IS like Sony, Pentax, and Olympus cameras).  
I laugh at the people who call this an "entry-level" dSLR.  The image quality exceeds Canon's $1300 semi-professional 40D model.  The features that more-expensive models include are mostly minor conveniences.  I took plenty of "professional" pictures with my 4x5" view camera.  I get about 1-frame-per-15-minutes with a large-format camera.  And yet people seem to think that the XSI's 3.5 frames/per/second makes it entry-level?!  Most photographers need nothing more.  Yes, if you are a professional wildlife or sports photographer, you want the upgrade.  If not, then this camera should meet your needs and then some.

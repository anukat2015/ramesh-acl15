Title: Black & Decker SDC850 Spacemaker
Content:
We installed this product in our fifth wheel camper several weeks ago.  The installation was really not as difficult as we had read in the reviews--template worked out to be true.  Only difficulty we had was the nut for the bolt (that came thru right above the water reservoir) had come out and we couldn't use that bolt, but the other 3 held it tightly enough that it was not an issue.  First usage was great, as have been every usage since then.  Love the way it looks, ease of filling water reservoir, temperature of coffee even 6 or 8 hours later.  We had nothing but problems with the prior B&D we installed in 2003--worked fine for awhile, then wouldn't brew coffee strong enough so it had to be run thru twice.  Had to watch that the water was actually going inside the pot rather than all over the counter, warming plate quit working, couldn't trust the programmable feature,couldn't pour coffee from the carafe without going all over the counter or table.  This new pot is a great improvement!

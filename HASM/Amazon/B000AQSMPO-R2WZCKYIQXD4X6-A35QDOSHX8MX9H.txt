Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
I LOVE this coffee maker.  It makes coffe in the blink of an eye, there is a huge selection of coffees and teas to choose from and it makes a really hot cup of coffee or tea.  The only complaint I have is that I use really large mugs and it does not fill my mug up.  I understand that there is a brand new model that has four cup sizes to select from and one is 11 1/5 ounces!  If you want a fast, good cup of coffee this is the machine for you.

Title: WOW, this is a great laptop
Content:
I should give this computer a 5 star rating, but since 5 stars should be "Perfect" I have to give it 4. In order to to be "Perfect" This computer would need to have blue-tooth, bluray, fix the flex in the keyboard, and add 2 mouse buttons. THAT'S IT. Now that being said this computer is as close to perfect as I have seen yet. The screen is great, it doesn't get hot, killer battery life (8 hours without taking drastic steps). The keyboard flexes a bit, but it doesn't affect typing and the mouse button is a single bar and that means you have to hit it on the outer edges to make it work great. This keyboard doesn't have the asus lag that most their computers suffer from. Windows 7 is great, the quick boot is great for checking email (8 seconds to online). The graphics card allows me to play Batman AA on native rez with no lag. The overclock mode gets the pc performance on par with what this system should be all the time, but the 1.3 mode helps the battery life by about 30-50 minutes and is more than fine for everything but gaming. 
I have had this computer for about a week now and it hasn't crashed once, the dell system I got my wife has the EXACT same programs on it and it has crashed almost daily. Asus has been well known in the computer parts world, and I have to say their computers are living up to the high standards they set with their parts. 
I will keep this up to date if anything changes. For the $800 this system cost you get a portable full sized laptop with the performance to match, but the battery life of a compact portable with no computing power. 
oh, one more down side is it is hard to find a case since most fit a 15.4" laptop, and this is 15.6.

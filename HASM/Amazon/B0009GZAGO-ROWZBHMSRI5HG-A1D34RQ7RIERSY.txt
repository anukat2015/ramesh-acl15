Title: Very nearly perfect camera!
Content:
My first digital camera was the Nikon 4300. Switching to the Nikon D50 was like going from a horse and buggy to a Ferrari! 
There are cameras now with higher pixel resolution, but I have found the 6.1 still is plenty for my purposes. 
The interface is very nice, with quick access buttons around the camera.
The battery lasts a long time, compared to my old 4300.
The quality of the images is wonderful!!
The only down-side is the plastic lens, otherwise I would give this camera a 5 out of 5. While I enjoy the light-weight aspect of the lens, I felt from the beginning that it seemed cheap, even fragile? Good thing I got the extended warranty because the lens broke after exactly 2 years of much use. 
Over all this is a fantastic camera, but make sure to get the extended warranty!

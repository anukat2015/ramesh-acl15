Title: iPods are great after they are installed
Content:
Once I got everything installed and running correctly, I was really happy with the iPod.  I don't know what the problem was, but installing the FireWire card, the software and equipment was a hassle every step of the way. But, once I got over the mystyerious freezes, things have been working like a charm.The manual that comes in the box is lacking in details.Be forewarned, the iPod does not support .WAV files. If your files are in .WAV format, you will need to re-rip them. A friend told me that I could convert .WAV into .MP3 format but the musicmatch software doesn't do it, contrary to my friend's assertion. Maybe I'm missing something.The ergonomics are great. The machine works flawlessly. The remote operation buttons are great. 15MB is a huge amount of storage space. I can't imagine that my music library would ever be big enough to fill the 15MB, let alone 30MB.Get the 15MB instead of the 10MB because the 15MB comes with a docking station, remote operation buttons and carrying case. The 10MB doesn't include these items and if they are brought separately, you get close to the price of the 15MB anyway.The back of the iPod is polished chrome.  After a couple of handlings, it looks awful.  But after a while, all the smudges and scratches blend together and it looks fine.

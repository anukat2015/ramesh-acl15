Title: Great Buy!
Content:
I am very impressed with my purchase! I had found this same camera for the same price, but without the tripod and all the extras. Buying it from this seller saved me easily over $100.00. This camera has a really nice mode that makes it very simple to take pictures with it if you are new to Digital SLRs. It is a great starter camera! I was slightly disappointed that I couldn't see the image on the screen before I took the picture, but to have that I would have to give up some of the great qualities that made me love this camera! It was received in the time stated and it was lots of fun to have the tracking code for it to see where it was and when it wound get to me.Definitely a great buy!

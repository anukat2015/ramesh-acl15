Title: How did I live without it?
Content:
It was nearly one year ago when I first recieved a Green Ipod Mini for my birthday. Since then I am rarely without it. I'd been warned by a number of people that the batteries broke easily and that they got scratched like anything, but even so I decided it was the gadget for me. The risk payed off.
Holding 1,000 songs makes for a great deal of hours listening to music or podcasts. I am absolutely addicted to music and this li'l gem changed my life forever. The sound has stayed crips and clear, the volume is great and I haven't needed to replace the earphones. For me, this is absolute perfection. 
The battery lasts for a LONG time and charging is simple and quick. Scratch wise, I invested in a good quality cover which stays on it all the time, so I have had no problems with scratches. The iPod is sturdy, (I admit to dropping it a couple of times) and the buttons and menus are easy and quick.
Downloading songs is also a piece of cake. Just plug your iPod into your computer or laptop and with iTunes I have been able to simply change around my songs, delete, add more, to my hearts content.
If you want something cute, colourful, stylish, easy-to-use and very VERY reliable, then go for an iPod mini. And with music downloading being so easy, it's more than likely that it will replace your CD's forever! So buy one, you will not regret it.

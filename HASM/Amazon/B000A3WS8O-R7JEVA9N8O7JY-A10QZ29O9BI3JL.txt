Title: Great Product, Video Conversion Not So Easy
Content:
It's an Apple product, so I would expect an easy straight forward way to get music & video loaded onto it.  Wrong.  The iTunes software works extremely well for music, but it's very partial about video.
The iTunes software will only convert QuickTime videos to iPod format.  If you want to convert other videos to iPod format, you will need to purchase third-party software to do this.

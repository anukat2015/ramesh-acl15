Title: Great for hardwood floors/tile
Content:
I bought this vacuum to use on hardwood and tile floors.  I needed a powerful vacuum to pick up dog hair and everything else my 10-month old could put in his mouth.  I bought this vacuum because it had a good price and I'm very pleased with its performance.  It picks up everything.  The size is nice and compact, fits easily in the closet and it's not too heavy.  The canister wheels roll smoothly on the floor and it doesn't tip over.  Also works well on area rugs.  I like the bagless feature, which is easy to remove and dump.  I can vacuum while baby naps and it doesn't wake him up.  Great vacuum for the price (and it looks good too!).

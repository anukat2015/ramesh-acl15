Title: LOVE IT
Content:
I have had my BD GT300 for several years. I love this machine.  It brews a perfect cup of coffee every single time I use it.  I am thinking of purchasing one for my sister for her birthday and am reading through the reviews.  I just had to write and let everyone know that for the price of the machine you just can't beat it.  A few things to note - I almost always make the 14 oz cup.  The amount of coffee that you get DOES vary as one reviewer noted, especially if the water resevoir does not have enough water to brew the size cup you want, so be sure to keep plenty of water in the resevoir.  One pod for a 14 oz cup is perfect for me. I can get two 7 oz cups out of one pod.  This is usually how I prepare coffee for guests since I have no other coffee maker in my house!  I have gotten the best results using Senseo and Folger's pods.  The coffee tastes spectacular after just opening the bag.  The flavor declines once the bag has been opened for more than a day.  In other words, the freshness of the coffee makes a HUGE difference.  This is not the fault of the coffeemaker but of the coffee packaging.

Title: stop shopping and buy this camera
Content:
LOVE this camera. It's my first DSLR and I love it. Great for indoor and outdoor shots. The separate controls for f-stop and shutter speed make manual shots very easy. The automatic controls make this as easy to use as a point and shoot. The size is big enough for for large hands but easy to handle for small hands. The grip is very comfortable and the weight is well balanced for all day use. 10.1 MP is a great size for large prints or heavy cropping. The manual sucks for first time DSLR users. Get David Busch's book.

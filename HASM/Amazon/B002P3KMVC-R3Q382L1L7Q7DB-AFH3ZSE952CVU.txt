Title: Excellent Ultra-Portable Laptop at a Great Price!
Content:
I recently purchased the Asus UL30A-X5 through Amazon and am very pleased with my decision.  Let me first begin by briefly explaining what I was looking for in a new laptop, as I believe that will give the reader better information when deciding if this laptop is right for them.  I am currently a student on a budget and was looking for the following: 1) Less than $700 in price, 2) Screen size between 13-14", 3) Windows 7 already installed (I didn't want an older computer with Vista that I would have to manually upgrade to Win 7 myself), 4) At least 320GB HD, 3 GB DDR3 RAM, and a Pentium Core 2 Duo SU7300 equivalent or greater processor, 5) Thin and light, and 6) 4+ solid hours of battery life.  Although a netbook offers a small size and easy portability, I didn't want to sacrifice power and performance for everyday tasks.  On the other hand, I also didn't want a large "desktop replacement" laptop that would be a hassle to carry around or difficult to take with me anytime I was away from home.  In summary, I wanted a laptop that offered a good combination of power, performance, and size for my money.  With that being said, here is my impression thus far after 2 days of using this computer:
Pros:
-Performance: Able to smoothly and efficiently handle everything I have wanted to do to this point.  It is even faster than my 3 year old 15.6" Dell Inspiron that I originally paid $1300 for at the time.
-Size and Weight: Couldn't be happier with the sleek look and light weight. It looks even better in person than in the pictures.  
-Quality: Some people may think you are sacrificing quality for a laptop with these specs for under $700.  I think this computer is built very well, and would argue it stands up to the much more expensive or name-brand models in the same class.
-Warranty: The accidental protection warranty offers an extra piece of mind, which is also something not often included without an additional cost in other laptops.
-Keyboard:  Very easy to use, great design!
-Mousepad: I love the textured touchpad on this model.  It is difficult to see in the pictures, but the touchpad is actually not a traditional "pad", but a bunch of tiny dots that track the movement of your finger.  Also, I really like the extra features such as being able to scroll up or down a page by using two fingers anywhere on the pad.
Cons:
-The only thing that I am not too excited about is the small (or "smaller" when compared to my larger laptop) mouse buttons below the touchpad.  This might be something that just takes a little getting used to, but it is more difficult to click the buttons than on my older laptop.  Again, this is my first 13.3" laptop so it probably just comes with the nature of a smaller laptop and I will get used to it with time, but it's just something I wanted to point out if you are transitioning from a large laptop to a smaller one.
Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Sure, there are better laptops on the market as some will argue, but only if you are willing to spend $1000+.  This computer definitely earns "5 stars" and I think anyone who is looking for an affordable, ultra-portable laptop with powerful performance will be very happy as well.

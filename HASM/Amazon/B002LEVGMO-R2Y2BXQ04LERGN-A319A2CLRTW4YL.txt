Title: Acer 1410 Review
Content:
I have been using this laptop for about 2 weeks now and it has exceeded my expectations.  It replaced my Dell Mini 9 for most small tasks. I am now using it with Windows 7 64 bit and put in another 2gb ram for a total of 4gb, and this little computer works great.  
As an amateur photographer this thing is great in the field, runs Photoshop CS4 with ease with 4gb ram, and the 250gb hard drive is plenty to back up with while out traveling.  Speaking of traveling, with windows 7 the battery life is terrific. 5-6 hours is no problem, the HDMI port is great for connecting to a HDTV and displaying photos and videos.  
I really like this thing, the build quality is good, the built in camera is great (Note to remove the 2nd piece of plastic over the camera lens it self, at first the video looked not super sharp) The keyboard is full size and with decent action. But the big battery and great wireless card make this thing awesome around the house and on the road. 
The glossy screen is a bit of a negative (Reflections), but everyone is jumping on the glossy screen bandwagon so not many other options. The screen is sharp and bright, but the off angle performance and the reflective nature of glossy screens are not as hot.

Title: Great Laptop
Content:
I thought this laptop was great and is great. I've had mine for a little under 7 months and feel quite at home with it, though the screen is so bright compared with what i'm used to and i've tone it down. 
The speakers are really loud and the battery initally lasts well (not too good when watching DVDs)but you can see a decrease in battery performance - this laptop has loads of memory well capable of ten of thousands of high pixelated photos and can jump between them very fast if on the harddrive, but not if coming from a CDR. 
The SD card reader also transfers 2GB of pictures (1012 @ 7 million [pixels)at a very good rate of speed. 
Vista works well, though is not compatble with photoshop 2002 or word 2002 as it defaults to the most recent word 2007 or office, whatever is on it which i personaly think is not a good system. I had to reset mine to the factory setting to begin again, loaded windows 2002 and then used a data tranfer cable to move all my items across which was 6 years of files and programmes. This then set windows 2002 as my primary file set up and all my problems were solved. 
Unless you want to enter a password eveytime you log on, when you set up dont put a password in! 
Built in wifi and webcab are also cool features and the laptop cable had a velcro tie which is a good design thought for strapping excess cable together. 
Good laptop and i am happy with my purchase and masy it live long and contineu to prosper!

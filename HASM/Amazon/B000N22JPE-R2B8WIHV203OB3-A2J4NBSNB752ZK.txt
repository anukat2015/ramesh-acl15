Title: Great coffeemaker value
Content:
Just got this yesterday.  Cleaned it with vinegar water (I always do this first) and had my first cup of coffee this a.m.  DELICIOUS!  Coffee is very hot, the way it should be.  Measured over 180 degrees -- perfect!  Requires a large footprint on the counter but I think any good coffeemaker would.  Can't speak to how long it will last but for me, this is great coffeemaker.

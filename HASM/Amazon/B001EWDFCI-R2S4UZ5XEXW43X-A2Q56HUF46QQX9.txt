Title: Great MP3 player
Content:
I got this Zune last week and am very impressed. The thing that really impressed me was the vivid screen & the Zune software.  The software was easy to download and within a short period of time, I was up and running with music.  I also really appreciated the fact that this player had an FM radio tuner.  I used to have an ipod before, but wanted to be able to listen to the radio too.  I am glad I switched and this product rocks!  BTW - The red color is beautiful.

Title: Very worth the price
Content:
I was going through reviews and the complainer who said it was too noisy is quite pathetic, relative to street noise and other noises outside living in a soundproof underground basement - like this other reviewer, is actually offset by the neglible hum this unit makes. I find it particular useful when you have a roommmate who likes to watch tv to 2am, this unit actually is a godsend. So this keeps me warm and helps me sleep. 5 Stars!!!!

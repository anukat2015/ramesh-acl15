Title: HOOKED ON GREAT JAVA
Content:
LOVE THE CONVENIENCE OF THE K-CUP. IT IS SO CONVENIENT AND EASY! CAN'T GET MY KIDS OFF THE MACHINE VERY EASY FOR THEM TO MAKE HOT CHOCOLATE. THE DELIVERY WAS FAST AND THE ASSORTMENT OF COFFEE WAS HELPFUL IN CHOOSING A FAV. LATER.
ALITTLE NOISY WHILE HEATING BUT THAT ONLY LASTS A MINUTE.
LOOKS ON THE COUNTER.
HOOKED!

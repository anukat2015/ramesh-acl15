Title: Winter's Best Friend
Content:
I have 4 or 5 heaters in my house and this one is my favorite. During the winter when the boiler cracked and my house dipped to 45 degrees (indoors) while waiting for a replacement, I went overboard and hoarded all the positively reviewed heaters I could find. This one was the best. 
Pros:
Dry, Even Heat
Relatively Quiet
Keeps the Entire Room Toasty, Not Sweltering
Cons:
Smell
A smell was emitted from the heater for the first few days. I'm assuming it was the oil. It wasn't overpowering, just annoying. After a few days it dissipated. It will warm the entire room to an even, warm temperature and you're not distracted by the buzzing of fans. It's a great price for the comfort of staying warm during the bitter cold.

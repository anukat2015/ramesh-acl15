Title: Leaks a lot of water!
Content:
I installed this unit in a carpeted bedroom. It leaks. I don't mean a few drops, it leaks a LOT of water! The owner's manual states "Water will accumulate in a holding tank at the bottom of the unit, and the unit will automatically shut off."  WRONG! Yes, the water does accumulate but the unit never shuts off. It overflows until a human shuts it off.
The first night I ran this in my bedroom, I awoke to about a 6-foot circle of very wet carpeting. I drained the tank manually (very difficult to do without spilling even more water) and then was stupid enough to try it a second night. The next morning I awoke to a much larger circle of sopping wet carpet.
Two days later the company is not returning my calls and the bedroom is starting to smell of mold and mildew. I am afraid this may turn into a very expensive replacement carpet.

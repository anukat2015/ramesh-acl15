Title: Performs Well
Content:
I got this 17" HP notebook 5 days ago (22JUL07). General impression: I did the right thing buying it for home use. For business I will continue to use an Asus V6J.
The Good: good performance, nice UI, generous screen, thin and light (for a 17").
Not so good: too many little blue lights (18 including the xb3000 docking); the silver plastic looks cheap; stickers didn't peel easily. 
I would recommend this 17" notebook for home use.

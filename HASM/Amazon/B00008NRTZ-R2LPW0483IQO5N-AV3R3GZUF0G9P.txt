Title: What a crock!
Content:
I bought this digipro in January 2005.  Used it about 4 months and the hose disconnected from the cannister.  Apparently the only thing holding the hose onto the cannister are the small electric wires that make the floor attachment run and wrapped around the hose is black electrical tape.  For $250 you would think a company as well known as Bissell would have more pride in the workmanship that goes into thier cleaners.  I will never buy another Bissell product because they are shoddy!

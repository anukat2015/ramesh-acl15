Title: Good Performance, Until It Breaks
Content:
I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum a couple of years ago.  I really liked it, though it does shoot stuff out of the back on hard floors, as someone wrote in a previous comment.  
In the past two weeks, the vacuum and it's accessories have broken.  First, it was an extra attachment we bought separately (from Electrolux/Eureka) that is a power stair attachment. It was great.  Then, the roller in it stopped spinning. It's not an attachment we used every day--maybe once per month. So, it wasn't broken due to overuse.  
About a week later, the roller in the vacuum stopped spinning.  The vacuum still has suction.  I can't figure out if it's an electrical or mechanical problem.  I just can't believe that it broke considering how much money it cost!  We don't have pets or any major messes, so I haven't put any undue stress on the vacuum!

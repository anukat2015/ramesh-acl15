Title: 45 hours is a Blatant Lie.
Content:
Something is wrong at Sony when they print an outrageous lie about a product.  The 4GB MP3 player doesn't come near 45 hours as they allege.  It's the same old 15-20 hour battery as previous models.
And for some reason, this new model is stripped of all but the most basic features.  Intelligent Shuffle is gone, and the new Shuffle All Songs is anything but intelligent.  The ability to view albums by artwork alone is gone.  All of the features that balanced the volume between loud and soft recordings are gone.  Also, the player must rebuild the library every time it is turned off for more than a few hours.
There are a few positive fixes, tho.  The time lapse between tracks is all but eliminated.  The new buttons are easier to use.  And the price is much lower.

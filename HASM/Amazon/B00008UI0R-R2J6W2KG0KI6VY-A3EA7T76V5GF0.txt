Title: LOVE THIS VACUUM!
Content:
After researching several vacuum cleaners on Amazon and at Consumer Reports, I decided to purchase this vacuum and I am so happy I did!  I absolutly love it.  It is light and easy to handle so it can be taken up and down the stairs with no problem.  It is self-propelled, making it very easy to use, and has fantastic suction.  My mom has one of those expensive vacuums and I could not believe how much this Hoover picked up after she had already used her vacuum.  I also like that there are no bags so one can just dump the dirt in the trash after use.  My husband is so happy with it he vacuumed the entire house recently, willingly, which in and of itself is a small miracle.  My mom also tried it out and loves it.  Very easy for her with her arthritis.  A great vacuum.  We have only had it a month but so far are really impressed and pleased.

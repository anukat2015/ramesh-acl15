Title: My Favortie Vacuum
Content:
This little hoover was for my aunt.  I have one, my daughter has one, most of my friends have one because we all love it so.  My aunt wanted a small sweeper for the steps and was going out to buy one.  I told her that I would order one for her and that she would love  and she does.  
It has really great suction, the best of any sweeper I have ever used and it has a very long cord, which makes if great for ceilings and steps and it is not very heavy.
I bought one like it in 1971 and pretty much wore it out, though it still works, the hose were getting very loose and replaced it with a new one in about 2005.
Love it.

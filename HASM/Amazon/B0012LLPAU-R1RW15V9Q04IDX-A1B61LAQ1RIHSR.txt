Title: Great Heater
Content:
I bought one of these gems (CZ-1500P), directly from the manufacturer, for $330 (after a $50 discount they gave me-Summer Sales), much cheaper than it is offered here.
I was full of questions and doubts before buying the unit, coming to review sites, reading and reading all the
positive and negative reviews, I even got more confused. 
I made my mind, when I heard from one of my friend that bought the device and telling me he is loving it. Since I trust the guy, I gave an order for one CZ-1500P unit to heat my 1000 sq apartment. After receiving the unit, I realized that although the unit may be capable of heating 1000 sq-foot , there is no such air flow to pass that heat through the every sq-foot of my apartment.But since I was really satisfied with the quality of the heating, I called the manufacturer again, and told them my situation and explained them I want to buy an another 1000 watts version just to make sure every sq-foot of my apartment gets its share from the generated heat. 
They told me that they are not comfortable with selling me the 1000 watts unit, since the only reason that model exists is for the homes that does not have the electrical fuses that can stand the load of the 1500 watts version, and they are getting some complaints about the performance of 1000 watts version, they offered me a discount, and that is how I got my second CZ-1500P unit.
Unit one works in living room, and unit 2 works in master bedroom. I set bought of them to 69 degrees and they are now the only source of my heating.
I used to have HVAC units in every room ( 2 rooms- 1 living room apartment), my typical electric bill was around $700 if I really use them - my apartment is the first building by the sea, and I get all the winds and stuff, and around $450 with turning on when we feel the cold, turning off again when we say ok that is enough, all in cycle, frustrating.
Now my two CZ-1500P works in harmony, they have very accurate thermostats, last month we used both of them nearly all the time ( we have a 6 months old baby girl, we want the house warm at all times), and my electric Bill was $205, which is nothing compared to $450 - $700 I was paying ( like a mortgage).
BTW, I must say that my apartment is very good insulated, there is minimum heat escape. 
Short story long, I am very satisfied that even just today I bought another one, as a gift to a friend, who lives in Europe : ) He will be getting a conversion unit from 220 volts to 110 volts, and he is all set.

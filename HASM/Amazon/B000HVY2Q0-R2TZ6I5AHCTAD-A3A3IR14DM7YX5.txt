Title: Silent heater
Content:
Does a good job heating a 10" x 12' bedroom. It's totally silent, so it's perfect for the bedroom. It does heat up almost instantly, but at only 1000 watts, does not heat up the room very quickly. Best to turn it on an hour before you turn in, to give it time to heat up the room. I'm using it in a house that I set to 58 degrees overnight, with single digit temperatures outside. The bedroom stays in the upper 60's for the night while this is on. Update: It stopped working after a couple of months. Got a new one that's been working fine all winter. The one year warranty was good, but the return experience was poor. Had to call many times over many days to get an actual person. The return involved cutting the end of the power cord and mailing at my expense back to them (good to not have to pay to send the entire unit back). Plus, had to send them money to cover shipment of the replacement unit (I think it was $16). All in all, it cost me over 40% of the original cost to get warranty replacement. It seems that this is becoming a common practice these days, but not easy to find out until you call for repair. So consider this a heads up so you can factor this in to your purchasing decision.

Title: Great for audio books
Content:
Bought this as my first mp3 player to download audio books. Chose SanDisc because Apples are not compatible with the library's download software. I chose the Clip because I listen to books as I workout or do yardwork. I have been very pleased; the small size is a real benefit from Cassette or CD players. The menu and navigation through the various operations is easy and intuitive, for this rookie mp3 user.

Title: Nice camera
Content:
Overall this is a great camera.  It's a little overwhelming since I'm an amateur photographer and new to DSLR's.  It's a good idea to spend some time reading the manual and fully understanding all the camera's capabilities & settings.  The camera takes wonderful pictures.  The only downside is the camera's tendency to underexpose pictures & make them a little dark.  I have found you must have a good flash like the SB-600 (or SB-800) to truly make this camera great.

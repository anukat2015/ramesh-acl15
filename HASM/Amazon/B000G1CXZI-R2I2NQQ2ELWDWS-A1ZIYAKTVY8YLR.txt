Title: Disappointing for a DeLonghi product
Content:
I had an older DeLonghi heater, and gave it to my brother.  I wanted to get one of the sleek, newer looking models, like the DeLonghi Solaris.  But this thing doesn't give off half the heat that my old heater did. Seriously, this isn't what I expected. If I turn it on maximum settings, and place it close to where I'm going to be sitting, or near the bed, it's almost okay.  But the other, taller model I had before was light years better.  Bummer. I'd return it, but no longer have the box, etc. But I wish I hadn't got it.

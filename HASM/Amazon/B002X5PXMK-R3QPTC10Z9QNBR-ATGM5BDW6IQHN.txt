Title: Very disappointed
Content:
I have to start out by saying I've had the same Kenmore canister vacuum for well over 20 years.  As it is starting to age, I went looking for another cannister vac.  This Bissell looked good... not the most expensive but not the least expensive either.  
I love getting new products and was very positive when I opened the box and put it together, but my enthusiasm waned when I got my hands on this and felt how cheap it was.  I kept it for a month and really tried to like it, but in the end I gave it to Goodwill and went back to my old Kenmore.  
Overall, it just feels cheap.  Not worth the money.

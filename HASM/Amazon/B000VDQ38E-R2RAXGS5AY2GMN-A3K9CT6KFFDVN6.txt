Title: This vacuum melted my carpet!!!
Content:
I wish I would have seen the negative reviews before I bought the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser.  I thought I had researched enough, but I definitely did not.  It is a waste of money.  DO NOT buy this machine!!  At first, I thought it did well picking up all the dirt.  Emptying the little dirt cup is very messy though and it fills up quickly.  The filters are hard to get to and they clog easily.  The belt broke the first day I got it.  We replaced it but it still smells like burning rubber and makes an annoying sound the whole time I vacuum.  And for some reason, as I vacuum, it spews all the stuff it is picking up right back at you through the hose attachment spot.  But the main thing is that the rotating brush never stops rotating--even in the upright position.  When I was using the attachment tools, it melted my carpet!  I contacted the Bissell customer service.  They were NO help.  They suggested that I use the tools with one hand and tilt the vacuum back with the other hand.  Talk about a ridiculous solution that is not functional at all.  Needless to say, I will never buy another Bissell product again.

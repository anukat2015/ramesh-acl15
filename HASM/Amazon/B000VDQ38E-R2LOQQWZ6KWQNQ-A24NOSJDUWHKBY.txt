Title: Pet Hair - Beware!
Content:
I got this cleaner as an Easter present in 08 (yes, I had requested it, so I was VERY excited to get it).  I have a long-haired black cat and beige carpet.  I was very surprised how well this gets the long black hair clumps off of everything!  It's so powerful, it begins to pull the hair in when I even sweep close to it.  The long hose and useful attachments make it very easy to clean my furniture and drapes, as well as her pet furniture.
The only drawbacks are having to empty the canister so much to retain the super suction (I need to empty it after 4 rooms, if I vacuum at least twice a week, if I do once a week I need to empty it at 2 rooms).  It is a bit bulky, but I have accidentally slammed it into all types of furniture and it is holding together very well.  The directions are terrible, but the folks at customer service are great when you call!

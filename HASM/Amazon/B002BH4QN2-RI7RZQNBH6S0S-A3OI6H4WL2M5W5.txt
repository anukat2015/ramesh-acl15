Title: Great Unmentioned Battery Feature
Content:
Others have posted comprehensive reviews, so I just want to add a note about the battery that I don't think any of the reviews so far have mentioned.
There is a plug in the 12-cell battery which permits you to charge the battery separate from the laptop -- just plug it into the charger.  The very first laptop I ever owned, a WinBook, had this feature and I have been amazed that it is not standard in every laptop.  The battery even has it's own flashing light to indicate the charging status.
With a second battery, this makes life a lot easier.  For example, when I'm at an all-day deposition, I don't need to bring and run an extension cord from a wall socket to the conference table out of concern that my battery will die.  Rather, I can just use the laptop with the battery while I charge another battery at a wall socket across the room.  Get a spare power brick ($11 on ebay), and you can just plug in the battery to charge at night like you charge your cell phone, without having to pull out your laptop and charger.

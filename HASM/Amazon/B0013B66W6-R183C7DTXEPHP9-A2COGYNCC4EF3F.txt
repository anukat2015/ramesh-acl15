Title: Now it is my favorite player
Content:
I have been fed up with the second generation of iPOD Video and Kenwood HD30GB9 (an expensive Japanese player which is not sold in the US) before this one came into my eyes. Sony have made lots of excellent players in the past, and the A series video players are the best they provide right now. The 8G/16G flash memory within such slim and delicate artwork is enough to keep all the collection I have, given that I'm a pure audiophile using this player only for music. The software is very easy to use and fully compatible with PC (Sure, because it's Windows Media Player), which contains one most important function missing in iTunes - library update. With regard to sound quality, neither of my previous players is a match in replaying Jpop. The vivid vocal, real and tight bass, and wide headroom make a superb listening experience every day. Now it is my favorite player that I would love to take with me all day long.

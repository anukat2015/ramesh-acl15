Title: Dell Products Suck
Content:
I have had Dell for years, but I will be making the move to Mac. Dells are crap and getting them to fix your computer is a true pain in the neck. I even bought the 3 year warranty from Dell but they just refuse to fix the problem, it brakes all the time and with different things.  With a Mac I will just need to go to the store and never mail it away.

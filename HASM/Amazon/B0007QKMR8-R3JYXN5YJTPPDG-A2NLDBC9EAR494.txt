Title: Call me vain, but...
Content:
I initially bought this camera because of it's "ease of use", and the compact travel size afforded for an SLR.  But after a trip to NYC I completely changed my mind and upgraded to the 20D.  First was the size:  This camera is an ergonomic catastrophy.  I did love its light weight feel while slung around my neck, but if you put any other lense on this camera, you will soon find that it will completely off-balance the camera itself and make for an abnormal feel.  The case is just too small for me for an SLR.  I also couldn't stand the cheap feel of the casing.  Hold it next to a 20D and you'll see what I mean.  For anyone getting into digital SLR photography I would recommend paying the extra $500 for the model above the XT...20D.  Its just as easy to use as the XT, but with MUCH MORE POTENTIAL!  Why buy a camera with limited capabilities, even if you are a beginner?  By the way, we all know its the LENSE that takes the picture, the camera just processes the information. You will never be sorry buying good L line lenses over the cheap stuff with so-so reviews.  I used the 17-40mm L with the XT and it took unbelievable pictures, no question.  I'm for sure keeping the lense.  
In summary; the camera has good but limited features, and with the L lense took amazing pictures, but the petite size and cheap feel didn't work for me.

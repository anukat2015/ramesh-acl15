Title: Great for kid's room
Content:
We purchased this heater at a local hardware store one Saturday night when our furnace stopped working.  We needed something quiet that would at least keep one room of our home toasty warm until the repairman could come out on Monday afternoon.  This little heater works great.  It did smell funny for the first few hours, but the smell wasn't too bad (and I am VERY sensitive to smells) and it has worked odorlessly since then.  Once our furnace was fixed we put this in our kid's room since it's the coldest room in our house.  We set it to the lowest energy setting ("$") and put the 'thermostat' knob pointing straight down (half power), and it works perfectly keeping his room warm while the heater itself isn't hot enough to the touch that he could burn himself.
One thing to keep in mind: we paid $60 for this at the local small-town hardware store two weeks ago, but yesterday we drove to the city and saw it at a very popular hardware/home store for only $30.  I also haven't had it long enough to be able to comment on it's affect on my electric & heating bills.  That said, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to others.

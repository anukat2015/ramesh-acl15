Title: Perfect for a 1 person Office
Content:
My office is freezing.  I needed a quiet heater to provide local heat.  This is a dream.  It has a thermostat (my office was 56 degrees this am - before i turned it on!).  You can set it to shut off when a certain temp is reached - but i just keep it on high all the time - just enough to heat my work area.  The thermostat reads 73 - but i don't think that is the room temp - just near the heater.  Not good for big spaces.  Perfect for a small office bc it is soooo quiet - that was important to me.  Also, you can set it to shut off in a specified # of hours - so i don't have to worry about leaving it on overnight.

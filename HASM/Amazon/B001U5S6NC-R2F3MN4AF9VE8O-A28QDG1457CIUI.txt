Title: 3-star only for the price
Content:
I bought this laptop for my 12 yr old niece and I was static because of the price.  the laptop itself is disappointing, it hangs for no apparent reason and just after 2 weeks, the free virus protection wasn't able to protect the laptop.  I had to buy a virus protection of my choice right away to save the laptop.  I would give it 3 star only because of the price.

Title: Good small basic coffee maker
Content:
Usually smaller, basic products are made/designed more cheaply. That's not the case here. This product has done just what I wanted it to, without the frills (do we really need a clock on everything?) or excess capacity of other coffee makers. I haven't had the problem with spilling water/coffee that others have - perhaps Cuisinart redesigned the lid? I do wish that on/off switch was easier to operate, but that's my only criticism of this product.

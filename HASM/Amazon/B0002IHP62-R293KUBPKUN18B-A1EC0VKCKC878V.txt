Title: Very disappointed
Content:
The AV400 worked fine for me for about a month or so. I saved all my very important files onto it and then, after about 50GBs were used up, it was unable to establish a connection with my computer. I figured it was my computer that was causing the problem so I rebooted it without saving any of my files to CDs or floppy disks. This was a very bad idea because after that I still couldn't establish a connection between my computer and the AV400. I emailed the archos website and told them this exact story and they just told me it needed to sent in for repairs and they couldn't even garuntee that files would be saved. This really made me mad because I spent $700 on this thing and it doesnt even work and I'm going to lose all my files. Does anyone out there know of anyway I could fix this problem and save my files? IF there is please email me at Smojo245@yahoo.com   Thank you.

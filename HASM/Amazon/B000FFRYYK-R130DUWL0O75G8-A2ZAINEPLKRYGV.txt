Title: Good. Very Good, Disappointed.
Content:
This pot delivers: great coffee, MUCH faster than any drip pot I've ever used. I love this machine for that. 
The design is simple and efficient- not beautiful, but it grows on you. Lack of interrupt feature is no big deal because of the brewing speed. Lack of a clock is less important for the same reason- you can brew quickly after you wake up
But it exasperates me every day.  To fill it without spilling water all over your counter, you have to lock the carafe lid in place before you pour the water in- otherwise it dribbles all down the carafe and onto the countertop, unless you pour VERY slowly and carefully. With the lid on, there's a tiny pour hole, so taking that safe route takes 35 seconds... just to pour in the water! This could be reduced to a couple of seconds, if the carafe had a larger pouring lip-instead of the stingy little lip that they provided. 
If you fill the brewer from the carafe, abide by  the fill line! The fill line looks like a seam, well down inside the carafe. It is unlabelled (!) If you fill past that line, you can expact a dramaic overflow, and puddle the counter and the floor with coffee. 
The carafe lid is hard to use, because the twist-lock mechanism requires that you acatuate a tiny, recessed handle to twist the lid. This could easily be a nice big tab sticking up. 
The carafe does an OK job of keeping the java hot, but as I noted above pours slowly, because there is no pour valve- so the pour hole has to be tiny to retain the coffee's heat. 
So, pour slowly, or get a big measuring cup with a real pouring spout. Then don't overfill it. Your coffe will be ready in three minutes.

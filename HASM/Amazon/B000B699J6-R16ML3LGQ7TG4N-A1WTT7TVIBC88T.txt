Title: Simply, cheap and awesome!
Content:
I'm a simple gal, and only needed something to play music. For me, 50 songs is plenty, so I got this cheap one. Surprisingly, it's been working perfectly well, allows me to hold important docs with me on the flash drive, and is easy to use. 
I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to pay big bucks for an Ipod, shuffle or anything, and just wants to play music from MP3s.

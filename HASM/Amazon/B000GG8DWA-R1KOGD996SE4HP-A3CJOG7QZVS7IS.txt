Title: Just what I needed!
Content:
I am so happy I found this heater!  I did not have high expectations for so little money, but I was pleasantly surprised by the output at the 400 watt setting.  If you buy this with the impression it will heat a very cold room, you will be disappointed, but if you buy it to keep a room warm once it is up to a comfortable temperature it works great. If the room is cold and you put it three feet away you will constantly have to move the heater or turn yourself as you feel like you are inside a one sided toaster.  I live in a triple wide mobile home that unlike my house ( a rental ) the mobile home has single pane windows and not the thickest insulation.  The heating costs are almost triple that of my home.  However, I found that if I warmed up the mobile home to a comfortable temperature and was willing to close myself off in a room, I could easily turn the house heater off and use the Optimus infrared heater to keep any bedroom warm.  Aiming at you from about 5 feet away is best if you are feeling cold, but it will slowly heat my 14 X 22 den up a degree or two over several hours.  Of course it will depend upon the temp outside, but our ( Templeton CA - halfway between SF and LA ) 6 AM temps are almost always around freezing in the winter even if we manage an hour or two at 60 to 70 in the afternoon.  My only minor gripe is the stupid rotating 400/800/Off/800/400/OFF knob.  Unless the room is well lit you can't tell where OFF is and the writing is on the side, not on the face of the knob.  Overall, I am impressed for the heat it delivers.  Almost every other heater I found was 750/1500w, cost more and I doubt they would do much better at their low setting.

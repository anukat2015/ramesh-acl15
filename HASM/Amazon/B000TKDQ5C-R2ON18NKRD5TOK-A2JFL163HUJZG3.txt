Title: I love this heater!!
Content:
I purchased this heater a little over a year ago. Now I have purchased a lot (A LOT) of items from Amazon over the years, but I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite, and most-used, products.
I'm one of those constantly cold people. I can wear layers, hats, whatever, and I'm still cold. So I wanted a little space heater to keep me warm - this totally fits the bill.
If you're looking for a space heater to heat up a large room, this probably isn't it. I'd recommend you go with a Vornado or something similar. This space heater gives you immediate warmth in a small area. Yes, over time this certainly would heat up an entire room, but it will take some time. Another reviewer likened it to a small fire, keeping you toasty when you're close to it, and I think that's a great description. 
I've used this heater almost every day since I purchased it. The only days I haven't used it are days when I'm out of town! Every day I'm here, I use it (in fact, it's on right now)! So I can say with the utmost certainty that this heater is reliable! It's also fairly durable...I've moved it around the house and have dropped it from time to time and it still keeps working. 
It terms of noise...I seem to remember thinking it a bit loud when I first got it, but now I have it on so often I don't even notice. Don't know if that's a good thing or not! :)
And to top it all off, it's dirt cheap. What more could you want?

Content:
I have had this machine for 9 months. The knob never worked all settings only the top or bottom.  The case cracked on the espresso side, the black handle broke off the glass carafe on the expresso side.  The steam no longer works that just happened.  I hate this machine and would never buy another KRUPS product,  what a piece of JUNKKKK.

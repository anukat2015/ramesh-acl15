Title: Craptacular.
Content:
I got this because it was fairly cheap for an 8Gig media player.  It was cheap in more ways than one.  Every thing about the touch screen is annoying.  The touch screen quit working after a few weeks witch was fine as you can do everything without it except change the volume.  You pretty much want to leave it at the middle anyway.  Max was distorting and min was practically mute.  I adjusted the volume with the headphones.  The video converter never converted the audio, so you would get a fine looking video with no audio.  I used third party converters but I could never get the video to look as good as the V-Touches converter but at least I had audio.  The added memory slot is for MINI SD chips which I don't think anyone makes anymore.  Just stay away from this piece of gossa.

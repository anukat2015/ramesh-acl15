Title: Cheap build quality
Content:
This unit did a good job cleaning and the filter stayed relatively clean, but the overall build quality is not quite there. For instance, the power chord is supposed to recoil when pushing the handle or the button under the handle, it never worked.  The release for the dirt container feels fairly flimsy.  Ultimately I returned it because the power chord did not recoil and this defect is unacceptable for a unit that had literally just come out of the box.  So an ok unit if you are looking for something moderately priced with decent performance but mediocre at best build quality.

Title: Netbook size, Laptop Power
Content:
I bought this because I didn't like lugging around my 15 inch Dell. I looked at other net books but was disappointed with there performance. I use this mainly as an entertainment player when traveling. This plays all my AVI format TV shows and movies, plus You tube plays without the stutters that are normal on most other net books. The size and weight are perfect and the 11.6 screen is just large enough that you feel comfortable watching it, the 10.1's are a bit small. I love it and would call this the pefect net book.
At 399.00 you can't do better.

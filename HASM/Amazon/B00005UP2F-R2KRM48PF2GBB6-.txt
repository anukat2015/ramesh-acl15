Title: Beats out our 600 dollar vacuum!
Content:
I bought this vacuum on the advice of the reviews here, and it is absolutely great!  I was nervous getting a canister instead of an upright, since I thought it would be unwieldy and tip over, as well as not deliver enough power.  I was wrong on all accounts.  I tried it out the first night, and after I figured out that you had to turn the attachment on seperately (why read the instructions?) I was off and running.  My mother has a 600 dollar upright that was the competition at a vacuum-off that night, and this little mighty mouse beat it out.  The head is smaller (width-wise) and flatter than an upright, so it fits into corners and under all furniture, and also those annoying crevices under counters.  As others have stated-GREAT for hardwood.  It's very powerful, but the sound isn't as loud as you would expect.  Without a bag you can not only be environmentally savvy but see the fruits of your labor.  And save some money, have you seen the price of bags lately?  And the vacuum design was very well-planned, I put it togther easily in about 5 minutes.  The vacuum is a dark champagne metallic-the picture doesn't do it justice-and very cool looking. It actually fits into a under kitchen cabinet in my new apartment!  I am an experienced vacuumer, but a first-time vacuum owner, and all my research paid off in this purchase.  Hopefully I can pry it out of my mother's hands when I move out.

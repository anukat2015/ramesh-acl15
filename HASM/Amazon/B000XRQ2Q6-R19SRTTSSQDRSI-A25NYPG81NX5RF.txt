Title: The Rhapsody Service makes all the difference
Content:
This product can be a little slow to jump between functions, but the Rhapsody to-go service is unparalleled in terms of value.  For something like $28/month, you have the ability to download 4.5 million songs with no 'price per song or album' as with Apple's competing iTunes service.  While all the media is still DRM protected by REALPLAYER's HELIX DRM solution, the simple fact that you can fill up a 30G Ibiza with all the album's you can't afford, and do it LEGALLY is simply amazing.
The only drawbacks I've seen with the Ibiza is that it doesn't have any aftermarket components like th iPod, and there is not software equalizer or listening modes (e.g. Concert, Classical, etc...)
I gave this product a 5 star rating because it performs as advertised, and I was influenced by REALPLAYER's Rhapsody service.
Oh, another cool thing is the 802.11g wireless connection which allows you to leapfrog across genres and artists directly through your wireless router.

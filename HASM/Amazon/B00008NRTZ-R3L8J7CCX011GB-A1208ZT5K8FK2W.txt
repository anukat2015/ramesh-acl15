Title: Works great...not for multiple pet households!
Content:
I read reviews of this machine on another website and decided to purchase it.  I have been very pleased with its performance.  It is quiet and I like the auto adjusting suction control; it does not tear my rugs apart.  My carpet gets very clean and the adjustable wand is great for my bare floors and stairs.  My problem is, that after 6 months of use, I noticed dust and cat hair flying out of the powerhead. I checked and the power head connection was completely jammed with cat hair and other dust and such.  It took many attempts to finally clear it.  It is working fine again, however I must check for jams on a regular basis.  I would not recommend this machine for someone who has more than one furry pet, or someone who owns pets with a great deal of hair.

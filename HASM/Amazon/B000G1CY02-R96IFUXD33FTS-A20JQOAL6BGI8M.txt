Title: Would not buy this
Content:
Nice-looking product, but faulty and no longer supported.  Bought two of these in the fall, used reasonably regularly throughout the winter, both worked well in closed and open spaces.  First one died about a month ago - light still worked, made normal clicking noise when turning the lower heat knob to higher setting, but didn't heat.  No way to repair; in addition, Delonghi has stopped making these and will only offer to replace with a much less expensive model (TCH8590ER).  Second unit still working but emits blue sparks at times (typically when on a medium heat setting); there may be bigger issues with this type of flat-panel heating that has caused Delonghi to discontinue.

Title: Nano of the older generation is better in terms of navigation
Content:
I have both the new (3rd gen) and the older (2nd gen) Nano. In terms of navigation, the older Nano is better. It's easier on my hands to click and go to different songs, or go to a particular artist. 
Although the screen is bigger in the 3rd gen Nano, it's not easy to download DVD from Windows computer to the Nano. This Video feature is not used by me at all. I really hope Apple will make DVD conversion to iPod easier in the future.

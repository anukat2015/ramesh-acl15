Title: Disappointed
Content:
I am so upset with this product. I don't own it yet but since I got my 30G ipod video stolen last week, I thought I'd check out if it was still in stock and purchase another... SHOCK!!! OF course APPLE has to produce a brand new ipod! I mean seriously, the disappointment grows each day when I find that new designs are coming out (this one not to my liking). I'm not a big fan of this aluminum casing either... I prefer the smudging cover of the ipod video. And the colors... The Black one looks so dull it looks like a fake casing or something that sells as the fake ipod... Silver looks nice on the NANO, but White looks better on the Ipod video... Bring back the ipod video design!!!

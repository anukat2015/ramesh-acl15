Title: great product
Content:
This is a great heater. It puts out a lot of heat and is really quiet. My room isnt super large but it easily kept it at 70deg on low.  The only things i didnt like was the fact that it didnt have tip over protection and the oscillating range was pretty narrow. I gave it 5 stars because again it was a great heater and the things i didnt like were not a big deal.

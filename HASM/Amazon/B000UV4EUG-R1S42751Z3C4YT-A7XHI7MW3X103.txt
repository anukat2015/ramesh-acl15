Title: Nice and compact...
Content:
I will say that this is a very nice and compact MP3 player.  It has a lot of space for such a tiny player.  It does seem vulnerable so you will want to handle it with care.  The quality of the sound is extraordinary; you'll want to use good earphones.  The ones that came with it are not bad with rubber earmolds attached.
I was aware of this before I bought it, but the SD and internal hard-drive are two very distinct databases.  As others do, I wish it combined the two as one.  The main database has a lot more options, the SD database is limited, but I can live with it.  I just put my favorite albums on the internal drive, and occasional albums on the external SD.  I put a 16g (32g is available as well) card in for around $30, and got all my albums on this tiny player.
The movie feature is nice, though it takes up a lot of memory.  It's an interesting way to watch a video on the go.  I sort of wish they included some sort of ebook reader, the screen is about big enough to read ebooks in tiny print (with reading glasses for me).  You can also download audio books.
I like the screen and I can actually read it in sunlight.  I sort of wish it shut off more quickly, because it does drain the battery.  The battery life seems to be around 10 hours.
I hope they come up with a version that merges the SD with internal drive.  I'm not sure if they can do that with a software upgrade, but I'm crossing my fingers.
All in all, I like it!

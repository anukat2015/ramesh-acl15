Title: decent little heater for the money!
Content:
This is a decent heater for the money. I have a 75K BTU Hot Dawg that I was too late (read: too lazy, waited until there was snow on the roof so I could not vent) in installing this winter. I purchased this because it only needed 12 gauge wire (20A) 220V power and it was easy to update the 110V outlet and breaker from 110V to 20A 220V, to accommodate it. It doesn't really heat up my garage like the Hot Dawg, but it certainly takes the chill out of the air and makes it more comfortable to work in there. I just turn it on a few hours before I head out there. I like it! Not sure on the cost increase on my electric bill, but it is probably minimal since I only used it maybe 20 hours total last month. Even with this heaterit has been a cold December January in Chicagoland!

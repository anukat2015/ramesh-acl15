Title: Great camera, zero effort at packing
Content:
Marvelous feel to this body with the BG-E5 grip.  It's now my only body, given its light weight, the quality of its images, and ease of use -- and I've had 30D's and a 1DsMKII.  
HOWEVER, I can't recommend ordering this type of equipment from Amazon if you care about decent, or at least adequate, packing.  There was one strip of 3 deflated plastic air bags in the shipping box, providing no isolation of the camera box whatever.  Being that the shipping box was twice the dimension of the camera box, there had to be some serious rattling going on during transit.  I feel fortunate the camera is functioning.  In the future, I would order an electric toothbrush from Amazon, but I'm through with ordering camera bodies and lenses from them.

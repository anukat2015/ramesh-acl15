Title: Awesome product
Content:
I own several Toshiba laptops, and this is by far the most efficient one that I own. This laptop is perfect for my needs with college, work, and of course entertainment. I use Microsoft Office Professional on this computer and so far I haven't experienced any problems. I can work on Microsoft Powerpoint while listening to music on Itunes, and still search the web without experiencing any problems at all. This laptop is designed perfectly for typing, and the weight of this particular model is perfect when typing from your lap. I purchased my laptop from Office Depot for 575.00 it was the last day of the sale, but I would have paid much more for a machine of this quality. If you have any question than just reply to this message and I'll try my best to answer it for you, good luck on your decision!

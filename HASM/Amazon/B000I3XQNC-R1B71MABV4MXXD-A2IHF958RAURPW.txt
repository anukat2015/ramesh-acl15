Title: Great camera !
Content:
The canon digital Rebel it's a wonderful camera, so many functions that I will really have to study on them, there's just one thing that I'm not sure if I don't know or it's like that, do any of you know if I can use the LCD screen to see the images when I'm taking the picture, or do I always have to use the visor?
It's a great product !

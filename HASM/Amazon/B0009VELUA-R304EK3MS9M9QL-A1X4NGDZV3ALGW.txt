Title: Great Coffee maker!
Content:
Well designed basket and interior coffee resevoir. All removeable and easy to clean. Makes a great hot cup of coffee and timer is well designed and very minimalistic. coffee "guage" works on mine and seems accurate. My main concern was how does the coffee taste after sitting there for 3 hrs, granted it was not like freshly made, but did not taste burnt or plastic-like. was very acceptable and stayed hot. The only thing I am upset about now is it is now on sale from Amazon. I ordered mine from amazon using a gift certificate and it shipped from JR's Music World  for $99.

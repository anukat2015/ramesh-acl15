Title: Great Coffee Maker
Content:
Yes, this is my first review.  I'm jumping in because I couldn't really understand some of the negative reviews.  I've had this coffee maker for over 3 years now, after some real problems with other grind and brew makers. It simply makes great coffee. When we have overnight guests, they rave about the coffee.
I've used the timer, the 1-4 cup feature and even the "grind off" feature when I was out of whole beans.  I was never disappointed. You CAN make weak coffee if you are so inclined, but you can also make a strong coffee.  It depends on the quality of the beans and how much you use.
Yes, you do have to follow the directions.  Yes, if you forget to put in the coffee filter the basket will overflow and create a mess.  Yes, you do have to clean out the grinder after each use (but that's no big deal - especially if you have a dishwasher).  And, yes, the grinder is noisy, but so are separate grinders.
To sum it up, it's the best of the coffee grind and brews that I've owned; it's reliable; easy to clean; and, makes great coffee.

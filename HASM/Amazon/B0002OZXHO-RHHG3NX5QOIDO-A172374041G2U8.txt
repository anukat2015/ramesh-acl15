Title: Ipod 20G
Content:
We received it very quickly and it was packaged very well. Unfortunately, it would not communicate with the i-tunes website. we took it to apple and because it was still under factory warranty they replaced it. We lucked out this time. we didn't check to see if it could communicate with I-tunes wehn we first received it. It was a gift and we didn't know to do that. I am happy that it was still under factory warranty. If it wasn't it would have been a pain to remedy the problem. I have not contacted the vendor.

Content:
This is a wonderful product for kids. It's unlike the really expensive ones for kids. It's durable, fun, and easy to use. My boys love theirs. I bought this for my 8yr. old and my 5yr. old so that they would leave mine alone and it's the best purchase I've made in a while. Granted the speaker option does get a little annoying when both of them are walking around without the headphones in but they really aren't that loud. Once they figured out how to scroll through the music they were good to go.

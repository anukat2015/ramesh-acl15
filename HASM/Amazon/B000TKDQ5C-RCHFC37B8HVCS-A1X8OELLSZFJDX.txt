Title: Disappointing
Content:
I bought this based on the number of reviews and the overall rating.  That was a mistake. Here's why...heater fan makes a lot of noise...so much noise that my co-worker asked me to turn it off (and our work-area is COLD). Fan-only and two speed options put-out the same amount of force. Periodically turns itself off. Not worth the discounted price.

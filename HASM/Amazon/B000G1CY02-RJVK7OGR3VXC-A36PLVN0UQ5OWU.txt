Title: Not totally Silent
Content:
I bought this heater to use in our master bedroom because it was supposed to be completely silent.  It is, except for when the thermostat comes on and off.  As the panel heats up and cools off it expands and contracts and the housing pops.  If you are a light sleeper like me, this noise may wake you up.

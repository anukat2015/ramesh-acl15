Title: This product will not last.
Content:
I own two of these. They do an excellent job of heating, when they're on. The problem is that after about four months both units developed similar problems. The overheat protection would turn the unit off for several minutes for no reason. One heater does it regardless of the temperature setting. The other only does it on the low temperature setting. In both cases the unit is not overheating, especially since one only does it on the low. They both turn off regardless of external temperature, how well the unit is ventilated or how hot it is to the touch. This is a defect that renders the unit practically worthless.

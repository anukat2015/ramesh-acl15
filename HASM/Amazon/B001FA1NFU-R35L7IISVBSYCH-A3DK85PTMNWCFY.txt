Title: i-pod nano 8GB black
Content:
I bought this to keep music running in my office and wanted to hook it into my existing speaker system.  I did not know that it's one design flaw was that it could not be plugged into a regular set of speakers that are not attached to a computer and be charged with its own cord at the same time.  I had to go look for a docking station that connected the wall socket, the speakers and the i-pod together.  They do not exist.  I had to buy a new docking/speaker system to keep it running continuously in my office.
Other than this problem, it has worked great, and I particularly like that it can hold all types of files, including stuff I record myself etc.

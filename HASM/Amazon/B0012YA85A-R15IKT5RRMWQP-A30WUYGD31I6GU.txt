Title: Avoid buying a Canon, customer service is the worst!
Content:
Though the camera was excellent (when it worked) buying a Canon isn't worth the hassle customer service gives you when something goes wrong.  
I had to send mine in twice in one month and the issues still aren't resolved.  With all the incompetent managers, run around, lies, lost information and additional time needed to repair, I am quickly becoming convinced that they are just dragging their feet to run my warranty time out.
I got stuck with a $1000 lemon (not including all wasted money on lenses and accessories).  I wouldn't recommend Canon products.  Go for a competitor with better customer service.

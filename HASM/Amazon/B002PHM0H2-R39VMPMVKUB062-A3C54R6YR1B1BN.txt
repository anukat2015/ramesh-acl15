Title: Love this Laptop
Content:
I am a PC guy, but I am also familiar with Macs.  I love the Sony VAIO...this is my third one since 2001 and they are all still working great. This new one though is the best.  My favorite aspects are the beautiful screen, Windows 7, and the Blu-ray player.  I have used it for a couple weeks now, and it really is a laptop I just love to work on.  The new graphical items in Windows 7 are awesome, which makes the user experience much more fun.  The VAIO also comes with pre-installed software, but it's all stuff you want to keep on it--like the Sony audio/video applications.  And again, I just can't stress enough how wonderful the screen is.  My wife is a photographer, and she has taken some photos that just have that "so real" look to them on the screen...kind of like viewing a Blu-ray moview on a great TV.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

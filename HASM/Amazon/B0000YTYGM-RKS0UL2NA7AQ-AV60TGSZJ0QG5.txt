Title: I love this coffeemaker!!!!
Content:
I ordered one of these two years ago because I was tired of burned coffee flavor from glass carafes.  It holds 12 cups and stays hot well into the day.  Even at night when I drain whatever is left in the pot it is still very warm.  I love that I can program it to be ready in the morning when my husband gets up for work at 5AM; and when I get up at 6AM the coffee is still piping hot.  I read all the reviews on it before I bought it and I never had any of the problems some people complained about.  You just have to use it correctly and it works great.  Yes, you have to make sure the filter basket is snapped into place and yes, you do have to screw the lid on correctly.  This is the best coffeemaker I have ever owned and we have worn out a lot of coffeemakers because we brew, most days, two to three pots a day.  A lot of coffee drinkers in this house.  I am ordering another one to replace the one I ordered two years ago because this morning it just gave up and died.  Wore out another one.  Usually we have to replace our coffeemakers every year but this one lasted two years.  I think that says a lot about how it is made.  I definitely recommend this coffemaker.  It is awesome!!!

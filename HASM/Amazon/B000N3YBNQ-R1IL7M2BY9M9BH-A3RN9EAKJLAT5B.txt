Title: Ease of Use = More Frequent Cleaning!
Content:
We really like this vacuum cleaner. It is much easier to use than our old Hoover upright.
PROS:  Its light weight, folds to a compact size that can be carried around with it's large handle, and transitions easily from carpet to hard flooring. It is not as loud as the Hoover Wind Tunnel.
CONS: The bag capacity is very small, but you can empty the bag & reuse it a few times to get greater value. It is NOT easy to use on stairs, so the Hoover will stay around for now.

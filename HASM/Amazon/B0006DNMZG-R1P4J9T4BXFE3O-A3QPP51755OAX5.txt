Title: loud
Content:
it's really loud in a small room, and definitely not for light sleepers or if you need quiet to concentrate. the fact that it's 360 means that it has to be placed some distance from a wall, which is not always ideal. the size and weight of it is nice and sturdy, with good safety features and intuitive controls. the heat doesn't blast out which is nice, but softly wafts out of the heater to slowly heat up a room.

Title: Excellent Digital SLR
Content:
Though not a professional camera, it is still very advanced.  The price has dropped significantly since the D90 came out.  Though the D90 does have a few more options like video, I was looking for a camera.  I had an old Nikon that used film and wanted a camera that I could use the old AF lenses with.  The D60 & D5000 require that the lens have a motor in them, so I would not have been able to use my old lenses.
Though I have only used my camera a few times, I have already taken a few thousand photos with it.  There is no fear of taking that perfect picture like there was with film.  With Digital, I take a few hundred pics and then narrow it down to that one perfect picture.  I love the quality of the pics that the D80 takes.  In daylight, the color of the eyes comes out crystal clear.  
I recommend buying a DVD that explains all the  options and an interactive book that explains the options.  There is so much that this camera can do, it will take me years to master it. By the time that I do, I will be ready for an upgrade.

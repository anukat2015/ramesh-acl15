Title: My hoover
Content:
Love the vacuum, is small and compact can carry it with no problem has easy to use handle. Love the long cord and rewind. The suction is great. I bought it especially for wood floors and it does great. I have a 9X12 area rug and the beater vacuumed it wonderfully. Can't say enough good things about it.

Title: At first, swell, but then...
Content:
Delighted with the design of this unit.  Took it to a freezing cold swap meet in a metal building.  Worked great for three hours, then...pffft.  Wouldn't relight.  Then even the pilot wouldn't light.  Luckily, the local Bi-mart swapped me straight across.  
So...sudden failures are possible.  Love the piezo lighter and compact, solid-on-the-floor design.  Like the two heating levels.  I'm playing music on a hillside on Sunday night, so I'm hoping there are not any more sudden failures.

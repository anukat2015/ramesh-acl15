Title: Another Great Bunn!
Content:
Our last Bunn died after 15 happy years, and we started searching for its replacement.  I am pleased with the Thermal Carafe, and the quality build of this machine is impressive.  It is much improved from our last Bunn, which was mainly plastic on the exterior.  The taste of the coffee is the best though.  I recommend this Bunn to people who want a great tasting cup of coffee.  The carafe keeps the coffee hot enough to drink for quite awhile, without burning it on a warmer.  Enjoy!

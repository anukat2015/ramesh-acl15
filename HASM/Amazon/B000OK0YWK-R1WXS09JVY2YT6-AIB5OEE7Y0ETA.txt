I got this as a brithday present, love the look and ease with whichit operated, but had problems from day 1, called support and they heped, 3 days later on the 15th there was an update to windows more problems, called again took 1 2/2 hours to fix problem. 2 weeks to the day, lost drives would not charge, called support was on and off the phone with them for 4 hours, they "we think its your cable, you will get a new one in 5-7 days" asked them to fed-ex it they can't do that. This morning took it back to store and bought an iPod.

Title: Cute, but has some battery issues.
Content:
The Ipod shuffle is very chic. Its small, easily portable, and clips to clothing. The 1 gb version has plenty of storage for your songs. I mean honestly, how many songs can you listen to at any given time? I bought this
ipod for my GF, but less than 3 weeks later, it died. It wouldn't turn on despite trying all the steps outlined in the troubleshooting FAQ on their website. Thankfully they have great service, and immedietly shipped a brand new ipod shuffle to my GF, after which she sent the old one back to them, free of charge.

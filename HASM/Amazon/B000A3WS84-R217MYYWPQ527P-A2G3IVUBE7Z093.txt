Title: iPod
Content:
1.Most importantly you can buy an extended warranty on the product that Apple does not offer. I am not sure if they offer it now but when I got my Ipods they did not. 
They have tech suppport but not actual replacement warranties. They have a free 1 year replacement warranty and you can buy an extended one.
2.Replaceable battery..That you can buy!
iPod has those as well.
3.Screen is the size of the Ipod
Then the system is probably too large to have the portability one needs. And I know the Creative Zen's screen is not that large. But here is the real truth. The iPod and Creative Zen Vision M have the same size screen.
4.For us Windows users it is plug an play compatible. I can hook my Vision up to any computer and it will work.
iPod is plug and play on my windows PC.
5.Never gives me an error sign with a folder..Which happened allot with the Ipod.
I have never recieved that error.
6.Good video player.
Same with the iPod.
7.Has FM tuner and recorder, built in. 
Well, no FM tuner or recorder. What will we do without radio.
8. My name is Steve Ballmer
Must be true.
The iPod is 30 bucks cheaper than the Creative Zen Vision M. If you are a student at a university chances are you can get an iPod  for $270.

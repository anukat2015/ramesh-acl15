Title: Great output for such a small unit
Content:
I already had the same heater at home but ordered another one because it's such a great heater in a small package. I have found that the ceramic heaters get much warmer than the regular ones. In the winter we use this in our bedroom and turn off the heat. The first unit I bought at WalMart, we've had for several years and it still works great.

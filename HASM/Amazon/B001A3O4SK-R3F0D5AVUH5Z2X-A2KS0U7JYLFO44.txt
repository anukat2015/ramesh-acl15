Title: OK heater
Content:
It does the job, but when I use it on high setting longer than 30 mins or so, the cable starts to get warm on several spots. The cable looks cheap and nondurable, I wonder if it would melt or cause fire hazard if I leave it on longer. Lasko's several previous models were recalled for a similar reason, that's why I am worried. I am thinking about returning the unit.

Title: Never again will I buy another Electrolux product
Content:
Less than two years ago, I ordered here the Electrolux TwinClean Canister along with the Pronto 2-in-1 cordless stick. A couple months ago, the motor on the stick that drives the beater brush began to malfunction, so that after operating for a few seconds, the beater brush stops rotating and, in my case, pet hair clogs up the head, making the stick useless. I called the authorized service center here in Dallas, where Electrolux is located,  and they told me this is common with this machine and cannot be repaired. So that cordless is now useless to us. Today I removed the dust bin on the canister to empty it and when I tried to put it back on, a small plastic clip broke under almost negligible force and now that part will leak air and thus reduce vacuum. When I bought these two machines, I trusted the Electrolux name and what appeared to be thoughtful design, but it's apparent that nice design will be going in the trash before its time.

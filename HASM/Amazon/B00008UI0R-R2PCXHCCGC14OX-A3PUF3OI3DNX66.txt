Title: WOW
Content:
I researched/read MANY reviews for canister vacuums. My husband had an old heavy upright vac that I could bearly lift and was on its last legs. I decided on a canister vac because we have two sets of stairs and was tired of trying to lug the vacuum up and down them. Well, the old vac died right before we had some relatives coming over for dinner and their child has alergies to animals and we have 4 dogs (and 3 boys). So instead of buying from Amazon like I planned I had to run out to Wal-mart real quick and buy this vacuum. I paid $199 for it. I LOVE this vacuum. It is light weight and VERY easy to use. The one brush attachment doesnt work all that well and does fall off easily if you dont cram it on the end of the nozzle. But other than that I was totally amazed at how well this thing works. You do have to empty the collection cup often but that doesnt bother me, just shows how well the thing is working and I wouldnt want it larger because it would add more weight to the machine. I have only had this for a couple weeks and I read some reviews that say the hoses come unattached after some time, however I think if you dont pull the thing around by the hoses that wont happen. The cord and hoses are a nice length in my opnion. Just pick the canister up and move it closer to your area of concentration (its certainly light enough) instead of dragging it to you by the hose. Until I had to make a decision that day I was still a little undecided on which canister vac I should buy, but am very, very glad I chose the Hoover Wind Tunnel.

Title: Nice design / Low Quality
Content:
I was very happy with this little gadget when I purchased it. I used it all the time. I would load it with audio books and music. I liked that I could expand it with the same memory card that went into my camera. The functionality was simple and the audio was clear. It would have been nice if the display had a backlight, but I was willing to live with it. After a couple months of use I started having file glitches. It would only recognize about 2/3 of what was loaded. After another month it would start playing everything like it was in fast foward. The voices would sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks. I would have to click foward or back to make it stop and play right. After a few months of that it just stayed stuck in fast foward mode. The counter would speed by, but no audio would come out anymore. I took good care of it. It never left the house, sat in a hot car, or was dropped. It just garbaged out on me. I paid around $70 for mine, so needless to say I was very disappointed. Maybe for some that is chump change, but for me it was investment. I doubt I will purchase anymore RCA products after this.

Title: Beautiful laptop but impossible to use!
Content:
This laptop is beautiful and light weight and loaded with right features. Except one fatal flaw: the touchpad is impossible to use. Its very difficult to press the right/left click button and they are badly positioned. Can't believe that Toshiba didn't even put it to a human test before selling!

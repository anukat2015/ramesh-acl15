Title: Solid, Simple, Superb
Content:
The elegant simplicity of the Zojirushi will be very hard to rival.
It is fast, well made, and has already contributed to many excellent cups of coffee.
I give it 4 stars because although it is by far the best implementation of a Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker I have seen yet, this entire area of technology could stand for some minor tweaks and improvements.
Notes:
The cup size is approximately 4.5floz
Pre-warming the carafe with hot water seems to greatly improve the time that it will remain hot while sitting.

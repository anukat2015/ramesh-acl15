Title: Very poor quality, though cleans well.
Content:
Believe it or not, we were able to get almost one full cleaning out of this product on the first day.  And then the motor died.  Yes, the power brush burned out on the very first cleaning, without me abusing the product, "testing" it to see how hard I could push on the wand, or even using it on any plush berber carpets.  Since Hoover closed it stores and authorized repair centers in my state (MI), there's a 2-week wait for replacement part -- so, back to Amazon it goes.  
On the plus side, it was able to get almost a full cup of dust and dirt, so it works quite well when it does work.  Unfortunately, poor construction and lack of support mean I am not recommending this vacuum.

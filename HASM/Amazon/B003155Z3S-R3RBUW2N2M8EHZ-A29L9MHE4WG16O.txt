Title: Best Laptop To Date
Content:
Out of the box this unit worked flawlessly. This is the most attractive notebook I've ever owned. Someone across the room heard a music video I was watching and said "that computer has great sound." It is great to have my numeric keypad back for crunching numbers.
Mobile broadband and 16GB flash drive USBs worked as expected. So did WiFi and a hardwired network. The 17.3" video is just awesome. This is my second, larger, notebook and I'll never go smaller again.
Very satisfied, great price and fast, free shipping from Amazon.

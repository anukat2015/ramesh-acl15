Title: another flawed machine
Content:
I've owned 2 of these machines, and one of the original macbook pro 17s.  I've had nothing but grief...  When they are running, they run great, but it seems after a few hours they begin to slow down and hang.  Programs freeze, and sometimes can't be force quit.  Mail program is still buggy, and occasionally all of your messages are lost and need to be reloaded.  Crashes when waking up from sleep.  Seems to have mysterious invisible files clogging up the hard drive.  
I bought this machine loaded with 4GB ram, high res screen, etc to replace my previous machine (which broke and had to go to apple care).  In the "old days" I could always get a couple of years of good service from a g3 or g4 laptop.  Now I am burning up 2 of these each year, and they are not fun to use with all of the crashing, freezing and lock ups.  What happened to apple?  They used to be a great company.  Now you have to pay $100 per year to be able to walk into a the store where you bought the machine and get service.  I've had it.  My next computer is going to be a PC...

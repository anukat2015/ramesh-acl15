Title: Cuisinaret coffeemaker
Content:
I bought this to replace a French Press that I had used for years and broken. This is so much easier to use, and the coffee comes out really good each time. I was sold on the French Press, but there was always sediment and the flavor wasn't consistent. The Cuisinart is easy to use and keep clean, and makes great coffee. I have good water, so I don't use the filter (some say it's a hassle). I've noticed the paint on the heating plate is wearing off, but it doesn't affect the operation of the machine. I've used automatic coffeemakers in the past, and this ranks right up there with the best I've had.

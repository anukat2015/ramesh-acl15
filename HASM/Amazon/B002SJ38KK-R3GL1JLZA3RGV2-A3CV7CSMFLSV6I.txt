Title: Big Bang for the Buck
Content:
Husband always was nervous about sharing the laptop with the children.  Now we have an affordable, easy to use unit that our teens and elementary age child can share.  It is mostly used for internet tv viewing, facebook, games, and a little bit of homework. Battery life is great.

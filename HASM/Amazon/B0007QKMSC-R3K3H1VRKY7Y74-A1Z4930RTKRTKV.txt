Title: Perfect Camera
Content:
If you are a photographer who wants to get more out of your dSLR, this is definattely the one..
So far here is what I think from it:
PROS>
1. REALLY FAST CAMERA !!
2. Has many functions that will push your photography techniques to the edge.
3. Quality of Images, Sensor and NOISELESS photos, even at high ISO (at 1600 almost none at all)!!
4. This is the Camera to have it, and we talking about a ALMOST Pro one..
CONS>
1. The only thing that might be drawback on it would be the size of the Grip at the camera, if you happen to have a big hand.
In this case... Might be worth to get the Grip (which I have done !!)
As you can see, this is a 5 star camera and you will not regret it. But if you are looking for a camera for just "point and shoot", better get another one, otherwise you might be driving a FERRARI just to go around the block !!
Canon Lover's know that this is definatelly a Great Camera.

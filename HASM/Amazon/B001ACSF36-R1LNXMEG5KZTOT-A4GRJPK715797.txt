Title: Good product - VERY poor shipping protection
Content:
After doing about a week's worth of research regarding potential portable air conditioners, it became clear that this was the best of the bunch...especially for the price.  It is a nice, heavy unit, blows out a lot of cool air and is not difficult to operate.  If it weren't for the shipping, I would give this product 5 stars.
Although I only read one complaint about the condition of the unit upon arrival, I have to believe there are many others who haven't chimed in with their experiences.  We received the first unit by UPS and when we opened it, the unit was covered in oil.  We wiped off the oil and gave it a shot, it didn't cool anything and it smelled like burning oil.  After a couple of days of working with Whynter's product support we returned the unit.  The second unit then arrived, with a much smaller amount of oil but still some.  After hooking it up, it was clear that it did not work either.  I was certain we did something wrong - but after working with their support group they sent out a third unit.  This time...perfect.  It works, just as we had hoped.  They should either repackage it for delivery, mark it "Fragile" or use a different carrier.

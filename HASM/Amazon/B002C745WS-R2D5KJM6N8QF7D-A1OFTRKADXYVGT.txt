Title: Incredible laptop
Content:
I have had multiple portable Apple computers for the past 13 years. This new 17" MacBook Pro with its gorgeous high resolution (glossy) screen and its incredible battery life clearly is the best Apple laptop I have ever used. It doesn't seem to run as hot as previous models - I have yet to hear the fans kick in and I am using it for video editing. For those who are thinking of upgrading the internal hard drive with a future faster one - it's much easier to do yourself than it used to be with previous MacBook Pro's. (There are easy to follow instructions out there on the web.) And since I have already opened it up to swap the drive that it came with, I can say that the incredible design details even extend to the interior of the computer. A clear winner.

Title: HP Suck!!
Content:
Ok, At first I thought Great Computer. Cheap, fast, plenty of memory affordable. How many of these reviewers had there laptop for longer than a couple months? I have. Here is the conclusion...
I sent my laptop in for repair over 7 times. First thing I notice a month later is 2 dead pixels so I thought ok thats kinda normal. a few weeks later my audio jack blew out. sent it in for repair. Then a month later my audio jack blew again. Sent it in for repair. This time they replace every part except for battery and powercord. Then after I got it back a few months later the powercord went bad. They sent me a repalcement but then a month later the battery goes bad. so now almost a year later with my warranty about to expire I a broken powercord and a broken battery.

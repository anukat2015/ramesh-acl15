Title: Barely any heat
Content:
Tired of overzealous space heaters putting out too much heat even on low, I was excited to find this produce.  It advertises radiant heating, which will heat the objects around them, but will not burn when touched.
What a lie.  My feet are currently less than four centimeters away from this product, and are still ice cold.  If I move them onto the product, they get burned.  The product is also being used in a COMPLETELY enclosed space (underneath a table with a tablecloth to the floor).  Although this is not recommended due to the risk of overheating and fire, considering it cannot even warm my feet in these conditions, I cannot believe the risk of fire is very high.
The heat stays centralized to the device, does not warm surrounding objects as advertised.

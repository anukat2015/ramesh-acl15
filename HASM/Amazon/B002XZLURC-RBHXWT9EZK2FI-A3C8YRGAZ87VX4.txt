Title: The best value for $ in an sub 4 lb laptop
Content:
Fast thoughts after having it for a couple of days:
Pros: (haven't really found anything to complain about)
Fast 
Light
Limited Crapware (way less than Dell / HP and the Sony I have)
Good Memory 
Crisp Display
Great battery life (* see below)
Keyboard is good - takes a little getting used to though
Multi touch pad - easy to use 2 touch to scroll vertical / horizontally and 3 touch to Right-Click
NO single access buttons on the top (near the Power button) I could never figure out why manufacturers clutter up this space. 
*
Battery is giving me about 6-7 hours on Battery saving mode - if I play around with power settings maybe I can get it to 8+ which is MORE than I've ever gotten on a laptop

Title: does the job
Content:
Placed below a window in the attic (8 cold windows total) next to an un-insulated crawling space, it does the job beautifully warming an area of 17X25, for some reason the attic is where it works best, but at 1500 watts I am moving on to new technologies (envi 450watt- jury still out on that one).

Title: Good cleaner under $100
Content:
If you are looking for a great Vaccuum under 100$, this is it. This unit cleans better than any I have used. I have used Rainbow and filter queen models and they do not compare. This folds up very nicely but it is very heavy. That is the only drawback besides the small bags that it uses. Expect to go through a lot of bags. They do supply you with several replacement bags right in the box.

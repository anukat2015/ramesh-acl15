Title: Awesome Laptop!
Content:
I upgraded to this laptop from an old Toshiba. I was reluctant to go with an HP but I thought I would give it a try. I have to say that i love this laptop. It has more than enough power to get the job done and the 17.3 in. LED display is just beautiful. The battery life is also very surprising, I can get about 3-4 hours (compared to 1-2 hours on my Toshiba) of battery time before I have to find a power outlet :) The cooling fan can get a little noisy while playing a game but that is understandable. Also, the HP logo in the back can be VERY bright in a dark room (I don't know if you can turn that off or not).  All in all, this is a great computer to upgrade to.

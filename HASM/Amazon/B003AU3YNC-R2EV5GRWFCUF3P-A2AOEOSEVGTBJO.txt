Title: Best Laptop I have ever owned
Content:
I am so glad my fiancee convinced me to spend the extra $100 dollars on this laptop (the one I wanted) over a similar Acer with a Core i3 processor. This is hands down the best laptop I have ever owned. 
The good:
LED display
Solid build
light weight (5.5 lbs)
full keyboard
HDMI port
bluetooth
EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE
Great price - $599
The bad:
not very much information online
weak speaker set
no firewire port
I will be recommending this notebook to my family, so obviously i would recommend it to you.

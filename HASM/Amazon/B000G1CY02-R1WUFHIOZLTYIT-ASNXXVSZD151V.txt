Title: back to order my 2nd unit
Content:
I purchased this heater almost a year ago.  I used it to heat just our 12x12 bedroom at night, and my 12x12 home office during the day through the coldest Boston months.  We only used our central heating system during the morning, evening, and weekends.  I tracked our bills, and we actually saved money on both the oil *and* electric bill.  The only thing I could figure is that the oil burner takes a lot of electricity to run.
I like a very quiet room, so this heater has been perfect.  I don't mind a couple minutes warm-up time.  I've also used the unit in our large cold spacious basement.  It can't heat that entire space, but I put the thing right next to my chair.  I stay warm, and it takes the chill off the rest of the room.
Last year I easily toted the unit back and forth between the office and bedroom every day.  This year I'm getting lazy and ordering a 2nd unit.  Plus I won't have to get cold in the office if I work late when husband has already gone to bed.  Good price, good function, good looking.  I may buy a 3rd one next year for our basement guest room.

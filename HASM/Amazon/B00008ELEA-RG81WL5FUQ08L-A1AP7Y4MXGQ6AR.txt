Title: Nice coffee pot
Content:
Heats up very fast and the coffee is very good, BUT, heating element seeems to lose power too soon, sometimes before the warranty is over, sometimes just about a year, sometimes a little later. I do not like luke warm anything, much less my coffee. I think that the element should last at least 3+ years. Otherwise it is a good little machine.

Title: MacBook Pro 13" (low-end model)
Content:
I bought from Amazon and saved about $[...], including S&H and tax.  This product arrived just as it should have--new, unopened, and with everything as advertised.
It is a great machine for the price, and is super fast.  If you want to upgrade RAM, go to Crucial.com and upgrade to the 4GB that comes standard with the high-end model for only $[...] Overall it is an awesome computer, blazing fast (extra RAM would make it more so) and these Macs are eligable for the Mac Up-To-Date program which allows you to get Snow Leopard for only $[...], if you buy before December 26.
I would highly reccommend this for anyone who needs a good computer.

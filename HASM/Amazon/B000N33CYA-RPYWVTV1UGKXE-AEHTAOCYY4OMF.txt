Title: Latitude C640
Content:
The laptop was purchased for only one reason to run the DryFire USA Trap program. The unit works really good. Because it is a reconditioned unit, I found that the battery would not fully recharge. Bought a new battery from batteries&butter for $64.00. It is a top notch unit now. This should be the only problem that you should have.
It was delivered before the time indicated by UPS. Oh yes, you do not get a manual with the unit, but you can download the manual at the Dell site.

Title: good for houses with only ONE coffee drinker
Content:
I bought this for my husband when we got married two years ago.  He was the only one who drank coffee and it seemed silly to get a big pot for one person.  It worked awesome, the cups alone are worth the price.  Then after a year I realized with the right creamer (vanilla caramel) coffee is good.  So I started using it too. It was used daily for 2 years straight and has now finally died.  It only fills up the cup about a 1/4 full and then you have to run it again (and again.) Definitely worth $25 for 2 years though.  The only thing they need to do is add a timer!

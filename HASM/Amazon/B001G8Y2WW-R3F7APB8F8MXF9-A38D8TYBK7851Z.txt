Title: Love this coffee maker
Content:
I received this coffee maker for Christmas and was able to open it a few days earlier since we were going out of town for Christmas.  At first I did not think I would use the coffee grinder as I already have a stand alone grinder, but, the grinder is so easy to use along with the coffee maker.  
Clean up of the maker is very easy, it takes less than three minutes and that includes wiping the coffee maker down inside and out.  It is very beautiful on the counter, and fits in well with the appliances that I have.  The program feature is also very easy to use.  I love that this model have the window on the outside of the maker so I can see how much water I'm putting in the maker.  The last Cuisinart I owned did not have this feature.  
It appears that Cuisinart read the reviews and improved this latest model coffee maker.  I would recommend this model to anyone, as I simply could not be happier with it.

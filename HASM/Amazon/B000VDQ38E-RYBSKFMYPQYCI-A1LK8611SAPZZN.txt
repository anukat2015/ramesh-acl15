Title: Broke in less than a year - huge disappointment
Content:
I've had this vacuum for about 9 months now and it won't pick up anything anymore, it just pushes it around.  I have 2 dogs and a cat and need to vacuum 2x's a week. It was good while it lasted but I really don't expect to spend this kind of money on a yearly basis for a vacuum. This sucks big time. I thought Bissell was a good name because my shampooer is a Bissell and it works great. I've had it for about 3 years and use it about about 6 times a year. Not a problem but the vacuum forget it. I'm going to email them and see if they'll do anything for me.

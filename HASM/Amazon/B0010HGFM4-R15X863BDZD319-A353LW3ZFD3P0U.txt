Title: Brilliant Camera!
Content:
I love this camera.  I've been dedicated to Canon and they've never let me down.  This is no exception.  I do with that it had better low-light functionality and maybe even went to 6400 (3200 is alright though) but for the price point you can't go wrong.  My biggest critique - the 50D came out a week after I purchased this camera.

Title: LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT!!!
Content:
I have just ordered my 4th Brew'n go!  My 1st is probably 5 years old and going strong.  I have one for home, one for my mountain cabin, one for my daughter and just ordered a back-up in case my 1st one crokes!  I use #2 paper filters just because it keeps me from having to rinse out grounds.  Makes a great mug of coffee to grab and run out the door with every morning and it is perfect for a one person household.  I even use it often with guest because it brews so fast I can make 2 regular cups of coffee and then reload for a second round.  Love it!

Title: SUCKS, and not in a good way
Content:
I bought this vac based on all the 5 star amazon reviews.  Big mistake.  I've had it about 2 months and it has already gone through 3 belts, the tool cover broke off and it's been in the shop more than I have used it.  Read the bad reviews as well as the good one.

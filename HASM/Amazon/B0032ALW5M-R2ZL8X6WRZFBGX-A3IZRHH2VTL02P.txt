Title: So far excellent, but I miss the Touchpoint of the Thinkpad
Content:
I am shocked at how good the keyboard is!
in a class by itself.
everything else is neat.
I would recommend it.
Now, after using it for some time I still very happy with it.
I do not miss the Touchpoint of a Thinkpad very much because I see that a small external mouse works even better.
I would buy again, and would recommend it.
nothing negative.

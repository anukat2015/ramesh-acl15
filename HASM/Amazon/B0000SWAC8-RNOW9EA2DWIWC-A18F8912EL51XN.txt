Title: Best Vacuum Purchase
Content:
After years of wasting my money and time buying, using, attempting to repair and finally discarding both upright and canister vacuums, I had little real hope the Electrolux Oxygen would work. Although this vacuum won kudos from most of the consumer websites I visited, years of disappointment left me dubious.
After a year of ownership, describing me as pleasantly surprised would be a real understatement. This little workhorse is light, easy to maneuver, and really sucks (hair, dust, dirt, almonds, etc.) I have two dogs, three cats, and a teenager, all dedicated to making as much of a mess as possible, but the Electrolux easily removes it from my area carpets, wood, linoleum and tile floors, furniture, blinds, ceiling fans, and the dogs (who now loved to be vacuumed).
There are only two improvements I'd suggest to the manufacturer: 	
1.	Make the power cord longer and looser for extension. (When I forget to pull the cord all the way out, I sometimes move the vacuum too far away and cause the cord to yank from the wall socket.)
2.	Make the vacuum bags easier to obtain. (I often have difficulty finding them in stock - they must be popular.)

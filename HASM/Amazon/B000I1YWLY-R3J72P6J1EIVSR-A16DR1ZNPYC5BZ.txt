Title: This Vacuum Really Sucks!!
Content:
This is my 2nd Electrolux EL7055. I hated the first one so much that I wanted more pain!
Seriously.  This is the best vacuum I have had in many years.  It has to have one of the best motors available to suck as much as it does.  The HEPA bagless system is great! I love the lighted power head. Although it is reasonable light weight, I tired of dragging my first unit up and down the stairs, so I bought another and have one on each floor now.
Although this is a factory refurbished unit, it comes with a 2 year warranty like my first run unit did. Without a doubt, buy this vacuum!

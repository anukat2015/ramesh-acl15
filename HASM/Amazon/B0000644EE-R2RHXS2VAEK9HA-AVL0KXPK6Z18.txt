Title: Great machine. Poor after-sales service
Content:
This is the best coffee maker ever. I have spent 40 years brewing coffee every morning, using a whole variety of machines. This is the easiest and makes fantastic coffee with very little effort. If you buy a cheap wall-outlet type timer, you can also set this to brew coffee before you get out of bed. Great! (That goes for most brewers/percolators, - obviously).
However.. if the transparent plastic knob breaks, then you are sc**wed, because eSalton (Melitta) has no means to contact them. Their toll free number is useless: it gives you three options, the third is for spare parts, but when you choose 3 you return to the three choices again! (Pressing 0 will disconnect you). So.. great machine but no parts service, so I guess that if your lid is slightly damaged, then buy another $60 percolator!!!

Title: NOT a heater
Content:
I bought this for my work because it is so cold in office. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.  It blows cool/ warm air. No matter how much I turn  the knobs to warm, the temp does not change. I think it makes me colder, actually. 
No HEAT from this "Heater". Again, I would NOT recommend.

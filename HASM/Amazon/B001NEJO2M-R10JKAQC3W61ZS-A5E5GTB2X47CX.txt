Title: QA problem
Content:
One of the USB ports went bad almost immediately when I plugged in my portable disk.  (Other USB ports were OK.)  Amazon was very nice to send me a new replacement right away.  Unfornately the second one has the exact problem as the first one.  The same USB port went bad again almost immediately.  I believe this is a manufacturing QA problem.  I decided to return it.  Toshiba has reliable products that I have been using for many years.  But this one I can only give two stars.

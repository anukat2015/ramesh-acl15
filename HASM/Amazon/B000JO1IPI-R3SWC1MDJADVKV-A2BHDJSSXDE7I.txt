Title: User interface is slow!
Content:
After trying several units at different Apple stores, all of the new iPod Classics suffer from a slow interface. Apple added Cover Flow and additional graphics but apparently underpowered the device and menu items have a noticable delay, Cover Flow is slow to refresh and even the clickwheel navigation is sluggish. These problems are not shared by the new Nano, which operates beautifully. I wanted to buy the classic, but now will go with either a Nano or a Touch.

Title: A  EXCELLENT  10 MEGAPIXAL  CAMERA
Content:
I HAVED OWNED THIS FINE NIKON 10 MEG CAMERA FOR A YEAR, AND AFTER LOOKING AT THE SPECS BETWEEN THE D200 AND THE D80 ....THE DIFFERENCES ARE VERY SMALL..........THE D80 AND THE D200 ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL
THE SHOTS I HAVE TAKEN BOTH NATURE, LANDSCAPES AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BREATHTAKING..I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS FINE CAMERA

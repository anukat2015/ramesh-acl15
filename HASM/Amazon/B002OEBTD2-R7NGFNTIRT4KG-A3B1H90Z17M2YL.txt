Title: Great little DSLR Penatx got it right with this one!
Content:
I am an advanced amateur and have been shooting with an SLR since the early 70's.
I bought my first digital in 1999, a Nikon 900s, and fell in love with the technology.
I've owned many many DSLR's since Canon introduced the first affordable (it was $3k)EOS D30 many years back.
I've since owned or shot with Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Fuji, Panasonic and others I can't remember.
I have always wanted a small DSLR that could replace my Canon mid range models.  Most recently the 40D.
The Rebel series was never comfortable for my large hands.
I bought this Pentax K-x on a whim as it was really inexpensive, offered a lot of features and promised very good high ISO results.
It has met or exceeded all my expectations!
I haven't been this impressed with a new camera since my 1st DSLR, that $3000 Canon D30!
It is small but comfortable to use, even in my big hands, and the pictures at ISO 1600 look like ISO 400 on other brands,
Even ISO 3200 is very usable!
The kit lens is very sharp!
As an added bonus you can use most any Pentax lens ever made which opens up a huge opportunity to try some Legacy lenses.
I have sold my Canon gear and this little Pentax does everything better and in a much more compact form.
It even shoots decent HD video.
I even was able to get a smaller camera bag.
Very Highly recommended!!

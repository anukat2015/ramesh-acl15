Title: poor construction/coffee tastes like tea
Content:
I am so disappointed- after using Farberware electric coffee pots for 25 yrs.  I will never buy one again. The construction is shoddy[made in China]- almost tin-like- inner workings are different- Coffee tastes bland and just barely warm- NOT hot and reliable like it used to be.  What happened to the good old days when it was made in the Bronx?
  I have been willing in years past to replace the pot or the coil after a few years of daily use - I could have lived with that- BUT- now the  new pot just makes a lousy cup of coffee. You too will be disappointed - Now I must find a new brand that makes coffee rapidly and keeps it hot - no microwaving necessary!

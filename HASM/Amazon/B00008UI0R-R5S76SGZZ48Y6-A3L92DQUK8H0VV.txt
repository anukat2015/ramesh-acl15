Title: Very Pleased
Content:
So far this vacuum has been great. I purchased for my basement which is finished. I just got tired of the lugging the upright up and down the stairs. I recently purchased an african grey parrot, she has a big cage but still makes a mess with feathers and food. I must say this vacuum picks up everything and the nice attachments or you can use no attachments like I do a lot when I want to pick up millet from the bird around the furniture legs or off the end table, lots of suction which is adjustable by pushing button on handle, It also comes with a stair attachment, works very nice. Everything seems very high quality on this unit, retractable cord is great. You will be happy with this vacuum.

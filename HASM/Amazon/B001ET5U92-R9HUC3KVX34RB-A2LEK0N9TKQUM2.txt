Title: Happy with my D90
Content:
I was torn between getting a D300 and a D90 but after thinking about it thoroughly, why would I want to buy a camera that came out a couple of years ago and costs $400 more?  I upgraded to the D90 from my D40 because I wanted the sub-command dial as well as the extra features with the D90 (commander mode, bracketing, ability to use non AF-S lenses...).  I love the camera and with the extra money I saved I was able to get two lenses and a battery grip all for less than for the D300 body and grip.  Great camera!

Title: Works good for games and videos
Content:
I've owned mine for approx. six months now with no problems at all. After having some problems with vista on my desktop I wasn't thrilled to have it on my laptop but it works good without any problems. We use it mainly for surfing the internet and playing videos and games, and I have to say that it works much better for this than my Dell desktop.

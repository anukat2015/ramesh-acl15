Title: wanted one for S/D cards!!
Content:
Well, I really was starting to like this one until I saw it uses Compact Flash. I need one that will accept S/D cards and also has a hot-shoe. I have previously had Canon, Pentax and presently Nikon 650N-SLR's and now have a small Kodak 650(wanted to try inexpensive digital). Want to upgrade to possibly a DSLR. I have lots-of Sd cards and want to stay with them. We are going to Alaska for 2wks in July and I need to make a decision. I have looked at the Canon G9 but don't like it due to no grip. Looked at Nikon D-40 and am now looking at Canon Rebel. I didn't want to spend my life savings, but looks like nothings cheap anymore. Any suggestions out there-- I'm totally open!!

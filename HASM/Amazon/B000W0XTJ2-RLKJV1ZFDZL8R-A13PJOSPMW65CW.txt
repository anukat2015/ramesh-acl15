Title: About two and half stars
Content:
My first laptop was a Dell Inspiron w/ a 14in screen about 7 years ago. It's still running WindowsME and I've never had major problems with it. 
So for my new laptop I wanted a touch screen that was small and light. I've had a lot of problems carrying around that dell even though it was supposed to be light; so the lighter the better. I also wanted a touchscreen feature just for fun. I plan on taking handwritten notes on this in class. I used to take notes w/ my Dell and always wished I had the capability of just writing in the formulas or what not.
I looked at several touch screen computers such as the IBM Levnovo series and Toshiba's, et al. All were beyond my price range. So for the price, this was hands down, the winner for value. However, there were many things wrong with this computer that made me regret buying it (but not enough for me to return it). Primarily Windows Vista issues but that's not really HP specific.
The bloatware has not been too much of an issue since I removed them before I used it so it was pretty easy.
I've had the computer for about 1.5 months and I'm getting somewhat used to the quirks of the computer. For example the long boot up and the fact that the fingerprint reader will not work coming back from hibernate. yeah, weird. Anyway here are the main sticking points for me:
Cons:
-Very reflective screen. Much more than I expected. Really unusable outdoors or a bright room. You'd have to turn up the brightness to HIGH.
-2hr battery life w/c I expected. But the annoying part is the 4 hour RECHARGE. 
-no parallel port! there is that docking port, though. 
-Vista. All (yes, all) the programs I installed I had to right-click and put that option to run compatible to XP. 
-dvd playback is slooooow. For whatever reason it starts out of sync. The audio is either ahead of the video or vice versa. It eventually catches up but very annoying.
Pros
-Very reflective screen. People around you can't see anything either so it's a plus while in class. 
-awesome feeling trackpad. you can move it even with wet/greasy fingers(not that you'd want to).
-touch screen. It was a little bit off at first but when calibrated it was pretty useful.
-light when carried
-finger print reader is pretty useful when you're in bed in the dark and want to sign onto a site w/o typing in your password
EDIT:
-the webcam is useless for me. i'm comparing it to the logitech pro cams. the quality is horrible for the pictures and so-so for chatting because of light issues. it needs bright illumination to be clear which is fine but it affects the reflective screen. I haven't tried taking a video yet.
-the speakers are great. the dell speakers were situated on the side but on this they're on the screen so it swivels along with it. At full volume, they're nice and full sounding. No distortion. 
-battery sticks out in the back. this is great since it gives you something to hold on to when you pick up the laptop, swing the screen around, fold it down flat and rest it on your forearm. you can view pdf files in full screen and make this laptop look like a book reader while you hold in in you hand. tap the screen to move a page. awesome.
-stylus is stored on the front of machine and it's connected to the laptop with a string. i'm not sure where this is supposed to go so the string just dangles outside the laptop w/c is very unsightly. I don't know if I'm supposed to tuck it inside somewhere or what but it's annoying. And I don't want to take the string out either because I don't want to lose the stylus.

Title: excellent heater
Content:
I am very pleased with this heater.  Unfortunately, the first heater sent to me did not work.  I am still trying to work out the procedure for the return.  This has been a huge headache.  When the second  heater arrived, it was exactly what I had hoped.  It has remote control.  It can quickly heat my bedroom or living room.  My only complaint is the horrible trial it has become to return the defective heater.  This trial has been going on for almost 3 months and is not yet completed.

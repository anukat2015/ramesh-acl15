Title: Love it!
Content:
Amazing technology. I originally thought an Ipod was gonna be like a digitalized Sony Walkman. Boy was I wrong. The ease of use and  multiple options on these gizmos make my head spin. the folks at Apple are truly genius! Only gripe is it's a little bit of work to set a track to play on a loop. Otherwise it' like having a ton of songs from almost thin air cuz the gizmo's almost weightless. Pure silk! A treasure! My favorite invention since the dvd player!

Title: ipod shuffle
Content:
I use it for music, but mainly bought it to use at bedtime for meditation purposes. I found I use it A LOT more than that! Absolutely love it and never regret buying it! I use it all the time. It holds even more than I thought it would. The only thing I would prefer in an ipod in the future is being able to see the playlist on a screen, but other than that I am very satisfied. It came a lot faster to my house than expected also and very inexpensive. Love Amazon and Apple!

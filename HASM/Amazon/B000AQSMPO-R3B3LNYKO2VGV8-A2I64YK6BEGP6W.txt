Title: Funny Taste
Content:
I love the idea of this machine.  I followed the instructions and ran thru a few cups of plain water to start,  but there was a funny metallic taste to my cup of coffee.  So I ran thru water and vinegar (per Keurig).  Still funny metallic taste.  Guess it has to go back. Too bad, because it would have been awesome!

Title: Great Little Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
Love this vac. Lightweight with great suction. Does an excellent job both my hardwood floors and area rugs. There is a flip button on the floor tool. Flip it one way, and small brushes extend from the tool allowing it float easily on hardwood floors. Flip it the other way, and the brushes retract for use on rugs/carpeting. Not fancy, but it gets the job done.

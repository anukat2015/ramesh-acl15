Title: LOVE IT!!!
Content:
I love this vacuum! I have only tile and hard wood floors so it is hard to find a lightweight vacuum that does a good job. I had the Blue dirt devil vision and loved that but my kids are rough on it when they use it so it was pretty beat up after 4 years so I bought this vacuum. This one is even better. Love the auto cord rewind. I love the tools. I also like the fact that I can vacuum small areas and get under beds easily. Dirt Devil makes the best canisters for non-carpeted floors by far and I have tried several and have returned several!!!!

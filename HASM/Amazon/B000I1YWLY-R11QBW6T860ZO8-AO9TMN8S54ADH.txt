Title: Electrolux El 7055B
Content:
Motor speed button, carpets/floors selector, and on/off buttons are too sensitive and easily activated at their present location. Wheels need to be a little higher. (Unit drags on dense carpet) Every thing else is great.
 Even with the above comments would still highly recommend this product

Title: Heats Well, Uses Alot of Electricity
Content:
We bought two and used them about 12 hours a day (over night) for a week (just before the electric meter was read). The electric bill went up more than $20 in only a week of use and the gas heat bill went up nearly $100 for the month. They work great but use ALOT of electricity which we were lead to believe was not going to be the case.

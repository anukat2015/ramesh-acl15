Title: Lasko Tower Heater is a good choice
Content:
This heater really fits our purpose.  We have a porch area that, while closed in, gets pretty cold in the winter.  The heater is a little noisy, but does cycle off and on so the noise isn't constant.  The fan oscillates which helps the heat be more even in the room.  Also the remote control makes it easy to change the temperature, turn it off and on, etc.  All in all, it was a good choice for us.

Title: Exactly what I bought
Content:
I live in the cold, shady part of our apartment building, and our room was very old with little to none insulation. Trying to get out of the bed in the morning is hard enough already, but with a biting chill in the air made it next to impossible. Once I got through the day of an odd smell, which it's supposed to, this radiator worked like a charm, with an easy to figure out timer that made it all worthwhile. 
I will say the manual is a little hard to read, with a few "lost-in-translations", and it's tough to figure out exactly the effect of the "Power Economizer", but it was never an issue. Plus the heating levels are arbitrarily labeled "1-6", instead of degrees. After a week, I found out I like 4.
Summary: 
Other than a few issues on the manual and thermostat use, this comes highly recommended.

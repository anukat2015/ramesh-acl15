Title: Get a CD Player Instead If you Like Music
Content:
It's a well kept secret that store clerks and most Apple tech support people don't know that I will now reveal.  No matter how much you'd like to improve the tinny, shallow sound that the Shuffle produces, you can't.  Spend all the time you'd like on iTunes to set the EQ, it won't do you any good.  Of course, I had to work my way up the complaint ladder and roughly 4 phone calls to Tech "Support" - their word for it; not mine - before I found someone who said, "Oh, you can't do that on the Shuffle."  I'll tell you what - save yourself some medication and buy a Panasonic Shockwave CD player instead.  It plays MP3 files, costs about the same as the Shuffle and the sound - WOW! NO comparison.

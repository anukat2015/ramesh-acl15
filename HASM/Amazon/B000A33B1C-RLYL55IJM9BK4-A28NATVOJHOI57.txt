Title: Best Heater Ever!
Content:
I first bought this heater at Lowe's.  I have a large bedroom that never gets warm.  With gas prices soaring, my house has been freezing although I have the thermostat set at 70 degrees.  This heater has 3 settings, and it heated up the bedroom to a warm, cozy feeling at the lowest setting 1.  I have used several other heaters, and none of the others ever heated the room.  This heater is amazing!  I liked it so well, I bought 4 more heaters just like it here at amazon.  I have several warm rooms now without paying a high gas bill.  These heaters also do not seem to pull much electricity because my electric bill was close to the same as before I used the heaters.

Title: Sweet!
Content:
In my career, I have owned - in a mix of film and digital - two Topcons, a Miranda, seven Nikons, ten Canons, two Voigtlanders, a Mamiya RB67, Pentax 645NII and a Calumet 4x5... Of all these, three have become permanently fixed to my bod: The Canon EF, Nikon F100 and now this Pentax. These are cameras that I don't have to think about while hanging out of a tree or helicopter, or shivering on the wet ground while the light changes rapidly.
The controls on this K7 are almost all on the outside, in the right places (for me, at least). The camera is very small for a SLR, but not cramped. The Body sealing and build quality are up to that of my beloved old Nikon F100 and Canon EF and better than my 5D, IMHO. Image quality matches the vaunted 5D and K20D, which means that the lens on it had better be a good one or I will know it's not. Although I rarely use them, video and live view are easily accessible (maybe too accessible) and there are lots of options for chimping. The shake reduction is a delight; occasionally salvation.
I have only two gripes. Pentax dropped the tethered shooting ability of the K20 and K10 (For what?!?!? Firmware rev! Please!) and for anything longer than 300mm, I have to bail out to Sigmas or use my old 645 lenses manually with an adapter. This is where Nikon and Canon show their beauty. I hope Pentax (Samsung) wakes up to this fact, because this camera is worth it.

Title: Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP
Content:
Great camera -- easy to use, high resolution, battery lasts a very long time between charges.  2 inch LCD screen is super for seeing technical information and viewing photos after you take them -- the only improvement I can think of would be to be able to use the LCD screen as a viewfinder when you're taking photos.  Anyway, a great camera, anyone buying it will not be disappointed.

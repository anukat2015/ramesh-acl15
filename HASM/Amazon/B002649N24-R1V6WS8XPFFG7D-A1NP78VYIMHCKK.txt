Title: You get what you pay for
Content:
Pros: 
-highly affordable
-good screen
-overall good value
-decent battery life
-good webcam + microphone (excellent for skype)
-good HDD and fast overall
Cons:
-Somewhat uglier than other brands
-Plasticky feeling
- My charging port is already defective- only charges when it's plugged in and being pulled at a sharp angle...ridiculous.
Overall, it is a decent laptop, indeed a great one for its price. Keep in mind, however, that it's not going to last you forever. Personally, I'm going to send it to Dell to do the minor repair and then sell it. I just bought a 13" Macbook Pro which I would definitely recommend to anyone, period. Don't be cheap with laptops if you actually want them to last you a while, especially in college.

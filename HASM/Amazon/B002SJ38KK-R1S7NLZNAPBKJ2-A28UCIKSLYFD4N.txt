Title: Great little notebook!
Content:
Great notebook, fast, boots up in like 30 seconds, battery lasts like 4 hours not 6 even at battery save mode, very light and easy for travelling, works like a champ with Windows 7, installed MS Office 2007 and works beautifully, handles well in multitasking, WIFI card ok, HDMI works ok and keyboard size is great!!!
I can list some cons but it should not be enough to not recommend this netbook...
Cons:
-Bluetooth button that does not work...why the hassle? Why did they put the BT button when it doesn't have BT?
-No DVD or CD writer
-Sound, you literally have to stick your ears to the speakers to listen to it :(
-Sometimes not good for youtube on HD mode
-Lasts forever to fully charge the battery
Conclusion:
If you travel as much as I do, use the netbook for basics such as skype, web surfing, MS Office, MSN, Youtube, Facebook, etc. You are good to go...
If you need a higher demanding laptop, don't buy...

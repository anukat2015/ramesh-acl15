Title: Great for cappuccinos and lattes
Content:
This is a great machine for special drinks like cappuccinos and lattes. It also makes espresso, iced cappuccino, hot chocolate and more. However, as far as the best coffee maker, my Keurig B-70 Platinum cannot be beat! For regular coffee I use my Keurig machine. Nescafe Dolce Gusto only has Cafe Lungo (regular strength, mild and decaf)but it can't compare to the k-cups (Van Houtte Eclipse, Emeril Big Easy Bold, Green Mountain Extra Bold Hazelnut, Coffee People Donut Shop and more). The Nescafe Dolce Gusto Cafe Lungo does not come out very hot. The Keurig always brews an excellent HOT cup of coffee! If you are looking for a machine that makes specialty drinks like cappuccino and latte, then the Nescafe Dolce Gusto is it. If you are looking for a machine that makes great tasting coffees then its gotta be the Keurig. I love both! With both these machines and my bodum chambord french press, I am good to go!

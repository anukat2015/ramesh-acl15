Title: Gateway is the best
Content:
I purchased the Gateway netbook from Beach Camera and am very satisfied. (free shipping and Fedex tracking).  The video quality is good. The sound isn't great but that's because of the small size. My desktop pc is also a gateway, and it's been working without problems for a year. I reccomend Webroot for protection, it's simple and inexpensive. The 11.6" size is a little easier on the eyes than the more common 10.1", and it still fits in the carrying cases made for the ten inch netbooks.
  The detachable battery lasts from 3 to 6 hours with a display telling you how many hours and minutes you have left, along with the battery percentage. There's three usb ports, two on the right, one on the left. Also an HDMI port for transfering the display to a TV. The startup and shut down time is very fast. I haven't had any freezeups or any other problem at all. There is no cd/dvd drive due to the size, but you can get an external usb drive for around sixty bucks.  
            
     If you're looking for small laptop and think the 10.1" netbooks are to small, this is the way to go.  The $450 pricetag is a great deal considering this machine works as fast as an expensive desktop pc. Highly reccomended.

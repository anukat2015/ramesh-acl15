Title: Excellent camera, love the live view.
Content:
I have the 14-54 mm lens attached to the camera, and using my E1 as the second body with the 50 mm lens. Amazed me how fast the camera is and colors are beautiful and full of life, the well known Olympus colors. I only wish it is a weather sealed camera like the E1. Get the E330 now, Olympus is not working in an immediate sucessor to the E3xx serie, since they are launching the E410 and E510, both of them lack the articulated screen, which are less user friendly when you work with the live view, you have to possition the E-410 and E-510 camera to eye level. The E330 is a great camera, and is selling with a great price now, if your pasion is photography, please make you a favor get the E330.

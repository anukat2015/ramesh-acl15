Title: Better MP3 player than any other
Content:
I just bought this ZEN last weeek and it proves to be the best MP3 player I've ever had. I don't like iPod which is high-priced and sticked to iTunes. The Sandisk Sansa E260 I used before has small screen (1.8" compared to 2.5" of ZEN) and its design is not eye-catching. The ZEN has all the features I need for the MP3 player: recording, photo, music, FM radio, calendar, alarm clock, contacts etc. I read one of the reviews in which some guy complained that ZEN is definitely designed for the right-handed people. Probably yes, but it's not a big deal.
Here are some of the disadvantages I've seen so far. First, the cable is too short indeed, Creative wants to make it apart from other manufacturer but it is really weird and inconvenient. Second, it takes too long to convert and input video files. Third, the keypads don't light up.
I just wonder whether Creative has any earphone which allows you to play or stop the music without taking out the ZEN.
Above all, it's an amazing product at reasonable price. I'm waiting for the X-Fi ZEN !!!

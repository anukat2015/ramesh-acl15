Title: Bravo, Apple... Bravo.
Content:
The 5th generation Ipod Nano is definitely worth the upgrade.  I bought it mainly for the new video camera feature, but am have found myself actually using nearly every other feature almost daily.  I keep it with me at all times, more than my cell phone. Here's my review of the features:
Video camera - The video quality is absolutely fantastic relative to the size and "add-on" nature of the camera.  The image is better than my Kodak Zi6 when set on VGA.  I do wish it had a 16x9 widescreen aspect ration, but I can live without that.  Even the low light quality is good.  
Microphone - The mic picks up sound better than every other pocket camcorder I've ever used.  You can get clear audio at reasonable distances.  
FM radio - The radio works pretty well, although I wish the antenna wasn't in the headphones.  While the radio is nice to have, I really don't use it much. 
Video playback - The new, larger screen is actually OK for watching downloaded or ripped content.  
All in all, this is a terrific device with a LOT of functionality.

Title: From someone NOT a pro
Content:
The Canon XTi is an amazing camera. It's so simple, you can literally point and shoot right out of the box and get great shots, but so loaded with features that it takes awhile to master it. I've used it for about 8 months, mostly while traveling, and I couldn't be happier with it. 
The camera body is small, as others have noted, but as a woman with smallish hands that wasn't a problem and the size makes it relatively light to carry around. The battery life is terrific--on my last month-long trip I recharged it once. The many auto shooting options--macro, night portrait, etc. are easily accessible by turning the dial on the upper right of the body. 
My 1G card holds about 400 10 megapixel photos--that's a lot of data!--be prepared for some long downloads.(Note: the camera comes with NO memory card, and it's certainly worth it to get the biggest one you can afford.) I experimented quite a bit with leaving the flash off, and the camera takes great photos at night or in low light. Camera shake is always a problem at low exposures, of course, and it's well worth it to carry along a mini tripod. The biggest problem is that the lens that comes with the camera is 18-55 mm, and you will immediately lust after a good telephoto, which can cost half of what you paid for the camera itself. (I'm asking my husband for one for Christmas.) All in all, it's a great camera that I anticipate will keepe happy for a long time.

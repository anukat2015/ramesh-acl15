Title: Negative all the way.
Content:
I only wish that I had paid more attention to the reviews that I had read before I actually purchased this poor excuse for a coffee pot.  We have had Black & Decker under cabinet coffee pots for years and had liked all of them but not this one.  Every negative thing in the reviews, we have!  The water reservoir is neither stable nor water holder proof.  The coffee does not come out of the brewing section hot and the hot plate doesn't warm the coffee. The pot is so unbalanced that it is in danger of tipping all of the coffee out of the pot and it is impossible to have a clean counter after pouring a cup of cold coffee to head for the microwave to heat. Every part of this coffee pot that could leak, does leak.
I truly can think of not one good thing to say about the Black & Decker SCD740B.  I am so disappointed in B & D for selling this kind of junk.  They have made their last money from me.

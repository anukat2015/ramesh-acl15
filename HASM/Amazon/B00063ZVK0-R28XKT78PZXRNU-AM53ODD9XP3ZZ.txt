Title: Vornado Space Heater
Content:
This Vornado space heater is the best purchase I've ever made from Amazon.  Our apartment is equipped with an ancient gas wall heater that shot a big ball of flame out the bottom the first (and only) time we tried to use it, so this heater made our unseasonably cold winter in California bearable.  It quickly heats up a fairly large area, is very portable, and the digital temperature settings make it easy to set and adjust the comfort level.  The unit itself stays cool to the touch so it's safe to use on a carpeted area, and it's virtually silent.  I wish I'd bought it sooner!

Title: DON'T BUY THIS
Content:
I am having the same problems as others. The unit is tripping each 2, 3 hours. I called electrician about this issue as AMCOR suggests, but he said it must be AC's problems, not circuits. 
Also water started leaking from this unit even though I did empty the water tank! My new carpet got water damaged! I am so in shock this. 
I have tried to call Amcor, but could not reach them because always busy. So I decided to retuen this and have been trying call Air & Water which I bought this from, but also I could not reach them at all, either. Waiting has been forever on the phone, so I gave up and had to do return process by online. Now they want me to pay return shipping fee and 15% restocking fee.  I just feel it is not fair.
Don't waste money for this unit. Find reseller that not ask any fee to return.

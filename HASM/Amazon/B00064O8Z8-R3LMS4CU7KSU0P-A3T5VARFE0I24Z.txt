Title: The only camera you will ever need
Content:
I purchased this when it first became available a few years ago and loved it. I sold it a few months ago because I had convinced myself that it was more then I needed. After trying a 30D and a 5D, I sold them both and purchased another 1DS MARK II. When you own the best, you just can't settle for anything else. The absolute only feature I wish this had is the sensor shake to remove dust like the new models have. Other then that, this is the perfect digital camera. Do yourself a favor and use a high quality lens with it. The best deserves the best.

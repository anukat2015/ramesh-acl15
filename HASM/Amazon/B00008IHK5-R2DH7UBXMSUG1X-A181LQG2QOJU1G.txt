Title: Great!
Content:
I recently purchased this coffee maker and I really do like it! I don't care if the permanent filter is not included, I would rather use disposable filters and not be bothered with cleaning the permanent one anyway. So far it has worked flawlessly and the coffee is extememly tasteful. I was going to purchase another one but it is now discontinued.

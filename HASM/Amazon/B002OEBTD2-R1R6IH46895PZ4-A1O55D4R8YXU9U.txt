Title: 5 Stars !!!
Content:
This is everything i hoped for & more. The new magnesium body is much more durable then the plastic, and its scatch resistent.The ability to hold it & access menu options with one hand is another great feature. It takes pretty good HD video as well.I've had no battery issues yet but ive only had it for a few weeks (I Heard They Fixed That Problem That Other Reviews Have Stated). Overall its an amazing dslr for beginner to intermediate photographers.5 stars !!!!!

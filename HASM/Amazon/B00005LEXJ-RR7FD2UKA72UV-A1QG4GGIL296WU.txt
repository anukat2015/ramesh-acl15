Title: Mr. Heat Tank Top Propane Heater
Content:
This is a great little heater and cost effective for heating a typical Florida Room on chilly mornings. It lights easy and gets up to temperature quickly putting out approximately 11 - 14000 BTU's of heat selectable by on the controls. We use it in a 10-25 room and it will bring the temperature from 47 Degrees to 72 in just under 15 minutes.
I highly recommend it for well ventilated areas.

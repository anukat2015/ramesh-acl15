Title: LOVE IT!
Content:
I love this vacuum!  To write a fair review, I vacuumed with my old vacuum yesterday and then with the Pet Hair Eraser today.  Yuck!  I couldn't believe the stuff this vacuum picked up.  As a matter of fact, I keep going over and over the same room, just to see how long it will take before I'm satisfied that the carpets are relatively clean.  Not only did it pick up some pet hair (apparently my old vacuum did okay with that aspect), but the dirt and grime that my old vacuum left behind.  Love that the dirt cup is easy to empty (my old vacuum has the filter inside the dirt cup and is a royal pain to clean).
Now for the drawback:  This vacuum is really heavy, as other reviewers have said.  Compared to my lightweight, I really noticed a difference.  BUT, in looking at the stuff it picked up, if that's the only drawback I can find, I'm happy :-)

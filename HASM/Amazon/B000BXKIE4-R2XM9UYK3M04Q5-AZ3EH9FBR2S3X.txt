Title: Brendas thoughts
Content:
I wanted a strong Vac that is why I choose the canister electrolux. Is very light weight and not very loud. It does seem to shut down while using it. The attachments are ok could be better. While moving around the canister gets stuck on the cord. I wish I had tryed it out in a store first even thou it has so so power it won't pick up the carpet pile very well. I had inhouse Vac for years then moved and new house wasn't plumbed for in house and was forced to buy Vac. I will be buying another Vac but upright this time less worries of pulling a canister behind me I still give it a 3 star but will have to give it a 0 for ease of using around house.

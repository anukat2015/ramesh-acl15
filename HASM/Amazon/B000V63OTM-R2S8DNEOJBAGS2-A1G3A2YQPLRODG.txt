Title: Simple and good
Content:
I read dozens of reviews here and almost bought an expensive coffee pot, then went to Wallymart (Sorry Amazon, but usually I buy from you if your price is cheaper) and got this one for $12.99.  Love it.  Makes good coffee and has small footprint on my counter. Does not seem to burn the coffee when keeping it hot. Only drawback is no auto off. But makes great coffee and tea.  Plus the pause function works great (no leaking) and pot does not leak when pouring. Has large pouring area to add water and 2 good water level windows. Aok.

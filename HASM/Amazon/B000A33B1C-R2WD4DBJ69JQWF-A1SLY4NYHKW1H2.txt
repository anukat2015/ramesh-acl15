Content:
It only took two days to arrive from date of order!!!! there was very little smell the first few days,now none.  The timer should have a disconnect switch to make it easier to change setting if for example your home during the day.  Other than that it seems to work great and I will be monitoring my electric usage to see how much it changes my bill. I am not exactly happy though that Amazon dropped the price 10 dollars one day after I ordered mine.

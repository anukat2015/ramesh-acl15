Content:
I've not worked extensively with this machine, so can't comment on performance other than to say it seems fine for basics, and runs cool.  The screen is very nice and very bright, and the keyboard has a lovely feel.  Track pad response is very good and reliable.  The track pad buttons are small and very stiff - endurable, but a much better situation if you're comfortable with `tapping' on the track pad.
The case seems solid and well-constructed, with a stout hinge.  Only worry is a little bit of battery wiggle.  6-cell protrudes, but in a very nice way that positions the laptop well on a desk and makes it easy to carry.  For a netbook it might be considered a bit heavy, but still very small and portable, and generally a pleasure to see and hold.

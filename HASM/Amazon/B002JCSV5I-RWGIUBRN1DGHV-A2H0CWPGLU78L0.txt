Title: Way better than my point and shoot... Nikon got it again with this one
Content:
All of the previous review have got it spot on and could not agree more, so I will not write another. I have this for my vacation and a wedding. It is just loads of fun and not intimidating to use( being from a point-and-shoot) with the Guide mode. The kit lens is great but have its limited reach so i bought the 55-200mm VR to compliment it. During the wedding, i manage to get 2 of my cousins to switch from point-and-shoot as they were impress with the D3000 with its ease of use and quality of the pictures.
I already out grew my camera bag as i add the 55-200mm and a 50mm prime in my collection.

Title: Excellent underdog!
Content:
With the prices of these units being so low, it definitely offers a great alternative to the ipod or flash based mp3 players.
I've been using this thing for a week here are my thoughts:
pro: easy to use, the software is fairly simple, great battery life on AA batteries, media (80 minute or about 10-13 hours or 300 MB) are easy to find - the 1gb disks need to be purchased on line but are still easy to find and are cheap, small form factor, simple controls, DOES NOT SKIP - EVER, great sound, good volume control, has shuffle mode with barely any lag, the 1gb disc holds a ton of songs, downloading songs doesnt take too long.
con: only one case available that i could find, no backlight for display, not as popular as ipods or the like.
I really like the Hi-MD format, it works for me and I recommend it to others (if they can still find them)

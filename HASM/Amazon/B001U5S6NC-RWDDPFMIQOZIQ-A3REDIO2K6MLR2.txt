Title: Good, Solid Machine
Content:
I bought this machine based on several criteria: 1) Light weight. It's a nice, full-featured laptop that won't cause me to drag my knuckles while carrying it. 2) Smaller size. I wasn't interested in 16:9, screaming DVD playback, etc.  I was interested, again, in reasonable size and weight, not a desktop replacement like my work laptop. 3) Price.  I didn't want to pay more than $500 for something that would either die or be badly out of date in a couple of years.
I like this machine.  I've had numerous laptops for work from HP (and Compaq), IBM, and Dell.  For the money and the features I wanted, plus the ports it has available, I'm pleased.  Would I have preferred a better machine with more horsepower and bells & whistles? Sure.  But I'm happy, and I'd buy it again.
My only quibbles are: 1) It's light enough (not flimsy; just light) that the bottom of the case rocks slightly when it's sitting on an absolutely flat surface.  It's not a problem because the weight of my hands pins it to the work surface as I type and it doesn't rock. 2) The two-speed fan is noisy. The low speed is almost inaudible, but the high speed can get pretty annoying in a quiet environment. And, unfortunately, the high speed seems to be on quite a bit.
This is a much better product than the eMachines eMD620 that I purchased for my wife a few months back.

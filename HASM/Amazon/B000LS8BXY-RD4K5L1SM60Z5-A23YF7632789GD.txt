Title: GREAT WHILE IT LASTED!  BUT IT ONLY LASTED 10 DAYS....
Content:
My wife and I fell in love with this heater as soon as we took it out of the box and plugged it in.  It produced almost immediate radiant heat, very pleasant!.  It takes a little while for the convection aspect to kick in.  The heater draws in the cooler air at floor level.  The warm panel draws the cooler air up between the back of the heater and the wall.  The narrow one-inch space between the wall and the back of the heater speeds up the flow of air, producing a sort of Venturi effect, which is what makes the air in the room circulate.
We questioned whether the thermostat and eco mode were working properly.  The heater has an automatic eco mode.  When the room temperature reaches the desired thermostat setting, the heater reduces it's power consumption from 1500 watts to 1000 watts.  However, the eco mode always kicked in before reaching the room temperature that we set on the heater's thermometer.  So, I don't know if this was a defect, or if this is the way it's designed, but it defeats its purpose by lowering heat output when the room has not even warmed to the thermostat setting.
If it weren't for these two problems I would have given it a 5.

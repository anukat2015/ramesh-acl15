Title: love the Keurig single cup coffee maker
Content:
I purchased this unit for myslef and bought my brother in law one for him to give to his wife for XMas - We both love the single cup maker- I use it 5 to 6 times per week.  The little K cups are expensive but well worth it- I impress company with the variety they can choose from and the ease of getting a cup of coffee.  The size of the cup of coffee is smaller then some expect but I am fine with that.  My sister in law also loves her single cup maker as well - In fact I am looking to purchase another unit for my mother for her upcoming Birthday since she too was oh so impressed!!!  A little pricey but if you enjoy good home made coffee worth every penny!!!

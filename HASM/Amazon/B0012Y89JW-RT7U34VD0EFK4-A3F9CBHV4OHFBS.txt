Title: From Point and Shoot to SLR
Content:
I just received my Canon Rebel XSI after graduating from two Canon point and shoot models. It is quite a step for someone who likes to take radom family shots without any fussing with camera settings. I was impressed after reading the other reviews on this camera as it does allow a fully automatic option similar to the simplier line of cameras.
After experimenting with this camera for a couple of days, I have taken the leap and tried to manual shots using various settings. So far, it seems to be an easy camera to use in both manual and full auto settings.
I purchased the semi hard case to protect it while it is hanging from the neck strap which comes with the camera. I am now considering the purchase of a macro lens to take closeups of my new grand daughter. The kit lens that come with the camera does have the flexibility of zooming and image stabilization which would not be allowed with the new micro lens. I feel that after I get more used to the manual camera settings and how best to utilize them without a lot of hesitation, I will purchase the macro lens. 
So far I can say after only two days of owning and playing around with this camera, I am very pleased with my decision. I almost purchased the XTI model and now am glad I spent only about $100 more to upgrade to the XSI as it has SD memory card, image stabilization and is 12 megapixal along with the 3" LCD display.

Title: Very pretty and loaded with features, but...
Content:
...that's about it. I bought this to use in my bathroom (don't), but the slightest bit of steam from the shower cuts it off, no matter how cold it is in there. Then the temperature reading gets stuck at 72 degrees (even when it's not) and it won't do anything until you've unplugged it for a few minutes. Plus, the extremely loud fan volume is the same no matter what setting you have it at--hardly good for ambiance when you have friends over and you want them to enjoy a toasty bathroom. The timer might come in handy to heat up the bathroom before I have to go in there in the mornings...now if I can only remember to set it. Sadly, I had way too much confidence in this unit and didn't think to return it until it was too late...

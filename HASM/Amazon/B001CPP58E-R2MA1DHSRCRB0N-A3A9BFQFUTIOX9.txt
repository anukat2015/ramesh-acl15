Title: Perfect for the office!
Content:
I have now purchased three of these space heaters for three people in my office.  They work great!  Set up is easy, batteries for the remote control are included and the people love it.  Just set the temperature you want it to achieve and it starts and stops to keep that temperature steady throughout their day.  I haven't heard any complaints!

Title: Fantastic Laptop Near Perfect
Content:
I bought the 15" 2.5GHz model and this is my second Mac (also own a Mac Pro in addition to two PC's).  So far I love almost everything about this laptop.
The weight is light and the laptop is very thin, and noticeably so next to our Lenovo Thinkpad. The build quality is superb, the keyboard is very very good, even better than the Thinkpad (which is legendary for having the best keyboards).
The wireless connection is fast even though my router is two floors upstairs in the attic level.  The speakers are nice and crisp and can be raised quite loud.
As for the operating system that is loaded with this laptop, Leopard, it's fantastic.  Very fast startup and shutdown times and everything just seems to work right.
The one quibble I have is the display...it's brilliant with fantastic colors and is very bright but is not consistent across the entire screen.  There's a thin band on the right edge which appears slightly dimmer than the rest of the screen.  Also, the left half seems to be a hair brighter than the right half.
However, to me, it's a very very minor nuisance.
This is a wonderful laptop and to put it simply - It just works right.
Coming from a fairly recent top of the line Lenovo Thinkpad loaded with Vista that was always sluggish, this laptop is a real breath of fresh air.
I highly recommend this.

Title: DON'T USE AMAZON OPTION TO SELECT COLOUR OR GB!
Content:
I do not have complaints on the product itself, but on the way Amazon works. I had viewed and read everything on the Ipod and when I was ready to buy it, I selected the colour "BLUE" and the GB and bought it. The process was easy.. I started to have doubts once I received the email on Your Amazon.com order, and read the title:   "Apple iPod nano 16 GB Black (5th Generation) NEWEST MODEL"[...]
Didn't I select BLUE as an option? I did, but the site works incorrectly, if they let you select the colour the reason behind it would be ... that you desire the product in that colour, right? Not what Amazon did...they sent me the Apple iPod nano 16BG in  BLACK !!!! I can't return it because i live overseas - Now I have a problem with my son...he didn't want his iPod Black !! 
Still can't understand why the would let you make changes if they are never going to pay attention to what customers are doing.

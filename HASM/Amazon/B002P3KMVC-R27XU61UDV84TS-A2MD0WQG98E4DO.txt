Title: Nice!
Content:
Very comparable to my Samsung X360-34p both in size/weight and performance. Very nice screen, quiet and powerful enough for daily use. Soft keys, just the way I like them, but mileage may vary with different users. Changing to a SSD is a matter of removing one panel in the back to swap out the drive, should take no more than 3 minutes. Battery doesn't really fit 100% snuggly and has a bit of play when installed, no big deal. In my opinion, it is worth the additional $250 compared to an 12.1" netbook, since it weights about the same but has a better and larger screen, 4GB DDR3 , a battery lasts forever and other goodies! You can even overclock 5% from the bios. Have a feeling my son will grab it when he comes back from college for Thanksgiving. Looks like I will get stuck with the Samsung NC-10.
Plan to load Windows 7 Ultimate on the SSD once I get the installation disks. Should be fun!

Title: Used three times and Comfort temp switch broke
Content:
The third time I used this heater the comfortemp button stuck and will not turn off. The design is such that you have to hold the unit to even push it and get burned. This is a poor design and I would not recommend this especially to homes with kids as it gets too hot to touch, even to operate the switches. It does heat a space but with a broken switch I don't think it is safe. I have to pay for return postage for service and so is not worth it since there is no service center near me and postage is a lot. I see how this company makes a profit by selling stuff that is too expensice to return for service. Don't buy this.

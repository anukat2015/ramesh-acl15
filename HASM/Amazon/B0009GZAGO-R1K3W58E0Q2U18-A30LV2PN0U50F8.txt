Title: Excellent Digital SLR
Content:
The D50 was a Christmas gift from my sister and brother-in-law (nice, huh?).  Both my brother-in-law and my niece are excellent photographers and I have admired their Nikon digital SLRs (he has a D400; she has a D70) for a while now and have kept informing everyone that I wanted to get one.  
I'm quite the amateur when it comes to photography and my brother-in-law thought the D50 was right up my alley.  All my former cameras have been the point-and-shoot kind, my last being a little Nikon digital pocket camera.  However, I wanted to become more adventurous with my photography and learn about F-stops, shutter speeds, and different lenses.  While I'm still in the learning stages, I am very very pleased with this camera.  
Right out of the box and a few minutes of reading the manual, and you're good to go.  I have been experimenting with the different mode settings and have changed out the lens.  My very first picture of one of my cats was awesome - the color, detail, and crispness was amazing.  
While I'm still learning all the features, I definitely recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for an excellent digital SLR.  As some others have noted, an extra battery, filters, zoom lens, good carrying case, and flash are extras that you should have.  You will definitely enjoy the experience of owning this camera!

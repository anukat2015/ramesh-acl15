Title: the perfect cup
Content:
This is a great coffee maker to make that perfect cup.  I use a cuisinart burr grinder which is a must. If you don't use fresh beans and Fresh ground coffee you will never get that perfect cup.  I like to try out different types of beans.  This coffee maker is great for that I realy like the metal mesh filter and the charcol water filtration. I also like the 1 to 4 cup feature for when I don't feel like drinking a whole pot my my self. The adjustable temp feature is great to because some times I like It black and some times I use creamer.  But for those of you who complain that it doesn't brew good coffee you will never get that perfect cup I you are using stale beans or a stale grind.

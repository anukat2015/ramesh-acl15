Title: Hoover Bagless Vacuum
Content:
Even better than we thought.  Haven't cleaned the cup/filter yet, but emptying is a breeze.  The carpet feature works great and especially like the controls on the handle and the adjustable suction.  Wish the large floor attachment had a place to keep it on the main unit.  The "crevice cleaner" won't be used much and doens't need a holding spot.  The main unit is so light, I often pick it up when negotiating tight spots.  Our last Hoover lasted at least ten years and we hope this does as well.

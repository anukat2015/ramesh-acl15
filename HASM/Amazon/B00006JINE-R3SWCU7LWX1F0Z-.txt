Title: great product
Content:
What can I say, the thing just works. I pulled it out of the box and I was syncing my entire music collection -- which is substantial -- in minutes. The product supports FireWire, but I still use USB and am glad that RCA chose to let you do it that way too. You get a nice set of accessories with this so you can play it in your car -- a big bonus. And it supports WMA. I also appreciate the fact that it is compatible with Musicmatch. The price is all right too.This thing rocks!

Title: Very disappointed
Content:
Way overpriced. I bought this 5 years ago and truth be told this was not a good purchase, one of my worst purchases. It does a mediocre job collecting dust and dirt. The turbine head does a pathetic job picking up dirt and is really useless. The little curtain attachment does a better job than the big turbine head.  The telescopic wand broke with minimal use and customer service was just useless with a long wait to talk to customer service. This is clumsy piece and it has a very short cord. Cleaning it is a really dusty dirty job which needs to be done frequently and it leaves a cloud of dust. If you have allergies then this is not the vac for you. 
 I am back using my 20 year old eureka vac. This 5 year old dyson went out with the trash. 
Bottom line;I will never purchase a dyson again and neither would I recommend it.

Title: well designed vacuum
Content:
I have had 3 vacuums in the past 10 years.  Prior to purchasing the Hoover canister vacuum, I had kenmore canister vacuums.  The Hoover is a MUCH better vacuum and at least $200 cheaper.  The Hoover has easy to detach attachments and an easily extendable arm (connects the canister to the vacuum) useful for vacuuming in high places.
EXCELLENT VACUUM!!!  I will forever buy Hoover canister vacuums now!!!

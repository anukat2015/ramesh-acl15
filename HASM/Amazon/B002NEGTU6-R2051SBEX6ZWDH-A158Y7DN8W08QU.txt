Title: Best Prosumer DSLR from Canon!!
Content:
Everything has been said about this camera. I bought the 50d when it first came out and thought it was a winner. But when the 5d hit the street I was sad at the features that could have been in the 50d. So I upgraded to the 7d when it hit. What a upgrade. You can't really compare the 2 cameras directly because they aim at different photographers. But the 7d was what I was hoping for in the 50d and now I have it. It was worth it!!. Read the other reviews then you'll know. I kept the 50d because it serves as a portrait and backup camera with wide lenses.

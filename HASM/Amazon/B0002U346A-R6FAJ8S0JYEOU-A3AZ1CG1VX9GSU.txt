Title: Little vac packs a punch
Content:
The Bosch Compact Plus Health Gaurd canister vacuum is a dream. This is my first vacuum and I know I made a great choice.
The suction power is adjustable, and man is it strong. I vaccum my short berber carpets on the second lowest setting and get dirt and sand left behind by my former roomate's upright.
It's quiet! I can hold a conversation on the telephone while vacuuming on low suction, the higher the suction selected the louder it gets. But even the loudest it gets is only as loud or quiter than the other machines I've used.
The small size is perfect for the condo I live in. The power cord and hose are long enough to fully clean the largest room and a little beyond.
The cord automaticaly retracts, this is a wonderful feature for those who are tired of winding up a powercord.
It cleans hard floors equally well as carpets. There is a switch on the head to change from carpet to hard surface.
The canister glides along with ease, no tugging the hose to make it catch up.
It is SOOO light. I don't have any problem toting it up and down the stairs, it is only 9.5 lbs. and the two carrying handles are sturdy and comfortable to grip.
The styling is handsome. The ruby red color is more fun than dark blue or black.
The telescoping tube can lie flush with the ground so it is possible to clean under furniture with at least 3 in. of clearance.
With the HEPA filter there are no particles of dust in the exhaust, it is cleaner than the normal air, it is condusive to households with alergies.
To recap, the vacuum is powerful, lightweight, manuverable, cute,  easy to use.
This is an awesome product, I would buy it again in a heartbeat.

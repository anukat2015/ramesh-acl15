Title: Not reliable
Content:
I may have received a lemon but the heater stays on for a unreliable amount of time and it seems the safety thermostat kicks in and it shuts off.  The inside of our house is around 55 degrees and we wished to use this for localized heating which when it is on works great.
One shortcoming when it is on is it is so bright compared to other radiant heaters that if your trying to read or work in the vicinity it can be blinding and should be considered for what you are going to use it.
I'm afraid we are going to return this to Amazon.
What does work great and reliably is the Presto Parabolic Heater which we will be buying another of soon.

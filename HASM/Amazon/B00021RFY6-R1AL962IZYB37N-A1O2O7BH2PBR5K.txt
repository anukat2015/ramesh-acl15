Title: Make no beans about it!
Content:
First, this is a great coffee-maker.  On the plus side, I like that you can mix decaf and regular beans in any ratio you want (I use 50-50) for the perfect custom cup of coffee.  I also like the water filter within the unit and the length of time the caraffe keeps coffee warm (at least 4 hours).  The price was right and although I was worried about the "reconditioned" status of my machine--it's performed perfectly.  No problems.
The only downiside, which others have commented on, is the amount of clean-up you have to go through each time you brew coffee.  There are several parts that need cleaning, including the grinder.  It takes about 5 mins. to run through the procedure, but the end result is worth it.  
Overall, this is a great coffee-maker at a great price--if you don't mind putting some effort into clean-up.

Title: Cozy heater
Content:
I bought two vornado heaters, one for a cold upstairs bedroom and one for my basement which I have fixed into a family room. They are kind of small, so I did not think it would be able to keep my basement warm, but I was surprised to see that it worked very well. I keep the one in the basement on all the time on low heat and it and keeps the room pretty cozy. On real cold days I could put on high heat and that's when it really gets kicks in and heats up the basement very well, but I have only had it on high one time. Low heat seems to work good enough so I can conserve energy.

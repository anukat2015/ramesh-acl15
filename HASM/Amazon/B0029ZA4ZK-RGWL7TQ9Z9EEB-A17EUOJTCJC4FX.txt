Title: Great Machine
Content:
This laptop delivers especially for the price. 64 bit Vista with upgrade to Windows 7 included, Turion X2 64 Ultra dual core mobile processor rocks, 1Gb dedicated graphics memory and up to nearly 3Gb with memory sharing on a Radeon HD 4650 stand alone video card, WiFi a,b,g,n and bluetooth built in, 6 Gb DDR2 RAM, 500Gb HD, Bright View screen is super clear, built in scrolling on the synaptics touch pad, if you use a mouse you can turn the touch pad off and more. I've been playing EQ2 online and playing music CDs both at the same time with no problems. This machine will run high end games. The only things I don't like about it is the 5400rpm HD which is not really that big of a deal and especially all of the preloaded software offers and trials that took me two days to identify and remove.

Title: Great little work horse!
Content:
We started our cleaning business 4 years ago and being short on start-up money choosing good sturdy vacuums was very important. We purchased our first 3683A along with a Sanitaire upright. Soon we were using only the canister. It is light and maneuverable. It is great for stairs and the suction is really good. I love the ease of changing the bags. Just open and drop it in! We really abused our first canister. We used it for a year exclusively. Then we used it in 2 post construction cleanings - one was an apartment complex of 81 units and the second was a 24 unit condo complex. I don't recommend using it for post construction because it is very hard on them but I'm happy to say that this little machine has lasted 4 years even with the construction dust! 
The only problems we have had is; 1)the hose is flimsy and will kink if twisted (We replaced it with a heavier hose)and, 2) the wheel came off after 3 years but was simple to replace. 
I LOVE the telescoping wand! I'm not crazy about the floor tool but found you can purchase replacements that work better for under $10. Also, the wand size will accommodate most other vacuum attachments. The one down side is that they don't have a motorized beater attachment.
I would highly recommend this vacuum for anyone in commercial cleaning! I think it would last for many years in residential use. We like them so well we now own 4 of them.

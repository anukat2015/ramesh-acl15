Title: Nice unit, but doesn't make good coffee
Content:
As a coffee lover, I was really excited about this unit because of the built in coffee grinder that you can set with the timer. You have the option of griding whole beens or using pre-ground beans with this unit.  It has some great features: thermal carafe, extra heat for 1-4 brewing, timer, pieces that are easy to remove and wash.  This coffee maker has everything I want except for one thing: quality coffee.  My coffee always comes out weak.  I have to put a lot more coffee in it to make it taste good.  After reading the other reviews here, I have to address a 2 things:
1) Coffee pours slowly: The thermal pot is insulated and the lid seals tightly to keep the heat in.  Of course it's not going to have a large spout where you can pour quickly.  There's no heat plate to burn the coffee.  This is the whole point of having a thermal carafe.  This compliant is not valid.  So you have to tilt the carafe more, at least you don't get burnt coffee.  Pre-heating isn't neccesary if you drink it within 2 hours or so.
2) Messy to clean up: The parts come apart very easily.  It doesn't get any easier.  What do you expect exactly with a unit that grinds AND brews?  All you do is pull out the grinder part and rinse it.  Then pop open the filter and rinse that off too.  It's not hard, really.
Summary: Very nice looking and functional unit that does it all.  But coffee comes out weak.  Find a better machine.

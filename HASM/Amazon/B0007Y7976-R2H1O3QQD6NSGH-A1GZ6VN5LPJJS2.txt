Title: Work's great, Look's great... Lacks afew things
Content:
I had/have a Apple Ipod Shuffle, It was given to me as a gift... Recently I tried to upload songs to it, It didnt work... So i thought it was broken... As i fell in love with the MP3 players (All day at work im running around checking on police cars... Listening to music instead of traffic was/is great), I went and purchased this one. It looks and works great, But i also got the FM transmitter thing for my car (so it plays through the radio using a station)... And im not to big on music, I have about 50 songs on my ipod right now, When driving and your at the end of your play list it does not repeat the list.... It just stopps... So while driving you got to restart the play list, The turning wheel thinger majig to move up or down doesnt help while driving when this happens either.

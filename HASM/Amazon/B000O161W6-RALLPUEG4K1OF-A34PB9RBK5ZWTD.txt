Title: Very satisfied with my Nikon D40x
Content:
From the very first day I loved my Nikon D40x. I usually use it to take landscape shots. It's light weight and ergonomic. I use it with 18-55mm, f/3.5-5.6 Nikkor lens. It gives a lot of options for new learners, and pretty much everything for the advanced photographers. I'd be more happy if it came with a very small capacity SD card though. You buy a large capacity card anyway but when you receive the camera, if you don't have one at home, you have to wait a day or two to take your first picture :) like me. Anyway, I like this camera and the pictures I take with it. One more thing, The details of a 10MP picture is far more bigger and better than for instance a 6MP picture. I'd recommend you to compare a 6mp and 10mp picture beforehand. it's amazing when you have this much detail on a simple shot. I recommend this camera to everybody who wants to become a good photographer.

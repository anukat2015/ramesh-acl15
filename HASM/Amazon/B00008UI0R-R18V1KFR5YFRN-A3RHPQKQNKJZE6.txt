Title: I hate this vacuum cleaner!
Content:
This is a cute little product, and I loved it for the first 2 or 3 uses.  Every single time since then, however, I have had to take it apart to fix the fan belt, which falls off constantly.  Seven screws out, seven screws back in.  Sometimes this happens 2 or 3 times in a single session.  The carpet suction on area rugs causes this to happen, which means that they are cleaned with the less effective floor suction option.  Just leaving the vacuum on with the wand upright for a few seconds causes the fan belt to fall off.  Worst part?  We overlooked Amazon's plicy of returns within 30 days.  An expensive mistake.

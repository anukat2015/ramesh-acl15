Title: Great choice for music on the go!
Content:
I purchased the iPod Nano primarily for use in the car (works flawlessly with a USA-Spec interface in a 2007 Accord).  The small size makes it easy to tuck away out of sight.  16 GB is more than sufficient for about 2,000 songs, it will take me quite some time before I start hearing any repeats.
Be careful with this if you want to use it with existing peripherals though, many of them aren't directly compatible with the 4G Nano (won't charge).  However, there are adapters available to correct this problem.
I can't comment on it's video capabilities since I don't use it for that purpose.
I am very pleased with this purchase!

Title: please ignore my 5 stars--i'd give it TWO
Content:
I wrote a very positive for this vacuum about two weeks after buying it but have rewritten it as the pieces have started to fall apart.  it is a great idea but poorly executed.  I love the washable filter, the retractable cord, even the look of it is appealing.  But it just doesn't hold together, the cord is too short and pops out of the wall easily and it loses power after a few minutes of vacuuming.  i really wanted to like you, shark roadster.

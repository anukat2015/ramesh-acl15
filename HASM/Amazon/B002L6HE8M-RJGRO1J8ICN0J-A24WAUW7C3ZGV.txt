Title: skips songs
Content:
very easy to download music from i-tunes on this product. this was about the only good thing. used this product 3 times. each time i used it in shuffle mode and after playing good for about 5 songs, product started skipping songs randomly. example: song would play for 20 seconds or so then i heard a little blip and it would shuffle to the next song. it did this repeatedly. obviously i got a bad unit. plus the battery life is nowhere as long as apple suggests. not even close. lucky to get 8 hrs music use out of a full charge. needless to say i returned this product immediately and just ought a sony.

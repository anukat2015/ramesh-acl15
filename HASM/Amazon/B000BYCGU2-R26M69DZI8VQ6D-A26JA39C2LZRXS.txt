Title: Best on the market - BUT NEEDS SOME CHANGES
Content:
Very nice coffee maker.  Looks good.  Works well.  Way to expensive!
I couldn't find a more superior maker so I bought it.  But - I wish to offer a few suggestions to the manufacturer.
The Capresso 441 appears to have been designed by left-handed engineers and artists with exceptionally acute vision.  In order to view the filler indicator tube with the number of cups marked on it, the user has to pour the new water into the tank using the left hand and squint around to the right side to see the small numerical markings on the tube that indicates how much water has been poured into the tank.  Why not include an indicator tube on both sides and use much larger numbers that can be read from a distance greater than six inches.  For the price of this equipment, the initial cost of adding another indicator tube on the left side would be minimal.  And, since most people, myself included, are right-handed, it would make filling the tank with fresh water easier.
My second suggestion would be to increase the size of the tabs on the lid so that it is easier to twist it.  With wet hands, the lid, when sealed is difficult to turn.
Finally,  there is raised round dot on the lid that indicates which position the lid should be in when brewing or when pouring.  Make it a different color.  I painted the dot with a dab of white paint and it is very helpful.
Hope these comments are taken seriously.  They could make your coffee maker beyond reach by the competition.

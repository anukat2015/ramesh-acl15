Title: Love it!
Content:
I use it to record audio for my church with the line-in feature. After the service I download everything to my computer and edit the recording before putting on a CD or our web site. I should have gotten the 8 gig, becuase I have so many recordings still on here to share with people.
  The voice recording isn't the best-most of mine have been distorted, so I don't even use that anymore. Otherwise, it is a great product.

Title: love it!
Content:
This is my second Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater.  We use this heater in our small computer room and it heats up quickly and keeps the room toasty warm.  If we close the door, the small room heats up to 78 degrees. If you're looking to quicky heat up a small room (12x12), you won't be disappointed.

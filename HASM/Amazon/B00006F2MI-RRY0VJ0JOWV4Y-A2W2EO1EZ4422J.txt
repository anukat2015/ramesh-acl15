Title: An extremely versatile machine!
Content:
This coffee-maker does so much! It makes weak, watery coffee! It grinds beans if you want it to! It inexplicably floods the entire counter with half-brewed coffee when you aren't looking! Perhaps it could be used to irrigate crops... It is time-consuming to clean, but in fairness I should also point out that the stainless-steel thermal carafe is a durable item that has withstood being hurled onto the floor in rage several times.  And if all these features weren't enough, it's pretty expensive too. If faced with the choice between having a car door repeatedly slamming into my genitalia and buying this coffee-maker, I'd unhesitatingly choose the Cuisinart!  The coffee would be lousy, but at least I could still have children...

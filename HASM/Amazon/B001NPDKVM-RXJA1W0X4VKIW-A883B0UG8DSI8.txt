Title: Excelent laptop for the price
Content:
I Bought this laptop primarily for programming, and occasionally converting videos from one format to another, besides the usual stuff, like browsing the internet and minor playing.
I must say that i was impressed by the product as a whole, from the design, the bright wide screen, the 5-in-1 memory reader, the full numeric keypad (a plus for me, because i usually work with excel, and typing number is much easier that way), and the power of its processor, which, albeit not being a Core 2 Duo, performs very well in multitasking with everyday applications.
The cons are a few, but i should mention them as well: No HDMI output, no PCMCIA expansion slots, no integrated webcam and no firewire port.
In particular, i dont need any of the things however, i think a potential customer should know it just in case, to make a more informed decision.
Overall i think this laptop is worth the $531 i paid for it, and would recommend it to whoever needs a nice feature-packed laptop for  a low price.

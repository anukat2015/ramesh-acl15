Title: Not good for the office
Content:
I bought this coffee maker to replace the office pot -- we had a favorite model that made good coffee but had a demonstrated record of dying after a few months.  This model makes weak coffee, but that can be compensated for.  The biggest issue is that you must put the pot in absolutely straight in order to override the "sneak-a-cup" option.  If you don't get this right, the brew basket fills up with water and then overflows.  Each of us who makes coffee seems to need to learn this lesson, some of us more than once.

Title: Great everyday tool for the money....
Content:
With old, original hardwood floors throughout our home and 5 children under 7 I needed something easy to use (for me and my little ones who love to help) that did a great job and wasn't a hassle to set up. This model is great because it comes with the bare floor attachment (better to use than the big head itself) as well as the hand held cleaning tool.  We're on a tight budget and I couldn't be happier for the money I spent. The only thing that I would desire in this product is stronger suction when using the bare floor attachment - only because our old floors have gaps between the boards that get very dirty and not much comes out from deep down...however for MOST hard floors this isn't a problem. The canister does fill up quickly but I use it at least once a day - and my floors need it!  On my tiled areas - this works like a DREAM and the big vacuum head works wonders on my bedroom carpet and got out SO much deep, dirty filth - and the carpet is only 6 months old! The suction is also excellent when using the crevice tool.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a canister vac.

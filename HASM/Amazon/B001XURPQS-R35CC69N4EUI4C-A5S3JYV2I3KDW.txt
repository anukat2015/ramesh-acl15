Title: Traded Up to T1i from XSi
Content:
And I'm glad I did! I got a sweet deal on Amazon last Xmas; a Canon XSi 18-55 kit plus a 55-250 IS zoom for only $100 more -- that's $150 off! I was pleased with the XSi, which I rated 5 Stars, with a few caveats. I found the camera easy to master and took some decent pictures... [...]
Then, in April, Canon addressed all my XSi caveats with the released of the T1i -- HD movie mode, high ISO, hi-res LCD display, advanced firmware, DIGIC 4 processor, more megapixels. For a price spread of around $250 the decision to trade up was a no brainer. I sold the XSi kit at a $50 loss and bought a T1i kit.
I beg to differ with those reviews that depict a T1i as EOS 50D with movie mode stuffed into a XSi body. That's a good description of the T1i's tech specs but it doesn't take build quality into account. The T1i is more attractive, more comfortable, has a better fit and finish, and feels more solid than the XSi. It's also more responsive, more feature rich, and I believe it takes better pictures.
Though the T1i and XSi share the same footprint, the grips are wrapped differently. The textured foam on the front of the T1i wraps around the lens. It is cut at an arbitrary right angle on the XSi which has led to numerous complaints about the XSi grip. The T1i has remedied this with better ergonomics and better aesthetics. As one who has handled both, I can definitively state the T1i feels much better in my hand.
The T1i has a rugged peach fuzz surface that the XSi lacks. It's smudge free and dust free, whereas the XSi is a smudge and dust magnet. The T1i has a richer feel to the hand than a XSi. There are added touches like a molded EOS badge on the T1i that is stamped on the XSi. No doubt about it, the T1i is a more refined, powerful, and attractive camera. 
I could rave on about the 900,000 dpi display, the HD movie mode, the high ISO, the DIGIC 4 menus, but I'll leave that to others. Thus far I have no caveats about the T1i.

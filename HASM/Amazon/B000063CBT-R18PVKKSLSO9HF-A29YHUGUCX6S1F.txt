Title: DeLonghi Listened
Content:
I am happy to say this company listened to the consumer. They have fixed the caraffe that dripped so badly. This coffee pot is great! My original coffee pot was purchased for me 6 years ago. The heating element finally went out. I purchased a less expensive one and hated it. I bought a new one of these and discovered that DeLonghi listened. On the steamer side I heat my water to use as steam for hot cocoa or a latte and can use it as I need to. It does not drip out as the water does in cheaper models. This is one product that you definitely get what you pay for.  I can say 6 months of the local coffee shop costs will be saved if you buy this and use it at home.

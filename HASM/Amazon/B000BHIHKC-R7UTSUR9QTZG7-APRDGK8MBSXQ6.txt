Title: Makes a great cup of plastic
Content:
First off the machine would not register that the reserve was full of water.  Had to mess with it several times to get it to work and run it through the cleaning mode.  Once it did work the smell of plastic while it brewed was a bit concerning.  The coffee had the same aroma and even had a weird plastic taste to it.  So after several attempts of cleaning and re-brewing (and wasting pods) everyone in the kitchen agreed that it makes a great hot cup of plastic tasting brown stuff.

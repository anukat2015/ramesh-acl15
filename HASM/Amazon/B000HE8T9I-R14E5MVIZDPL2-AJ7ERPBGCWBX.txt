Title: Just buy the Dyson.
Content:
Yes, a Dyson is $400 and up.  BUT.  I wish I had spent that $400 initially rather than the $200 I spent for this, the close to $100 I spent having it fixed repeatedly, and then the $400+ when I finally did get rid of this terrible vacuum and buy the Dyson.  If I had bought the Dyson in the first place, I would have saved about $300.
The first time I used the Infinity was to clean up Christmas tree needles.  It clogged immediately.  I should have known then and tried to return it, but I assumed the needles were just too much for any vacuum.  I had this vacuum for almost three years, but for the larger part of the last two I had to take it apart and use a bamboo skewer to clean out the clogs every time I wanted to vacuum.  There are just SO many problems with this vacuum.  The hoses and tubes have several 90 degree turns, which cause terrible clogs, especially as the machine gets older.  The hoses do not disconnect easily and the rings which attach them break off when you attempt to disconnect the hoses.  After six months, my machine was held together with duct tape.  The canister is awkward and bulky to clean out and the hinges that connect the canister door broke off of mine and then the door would never stay on.  When this vacuum clogs, it shoots dirt and other particles out behind it, creating a bigger mess than what you started with.  At the slightest hint of a clog, the vacuum loses almost all suction.  
After almost three years of dirty floors and lots of frustration each time I tried to clean, I finally went out and bought the Dyson - which comes with a five year warranty and actually works.

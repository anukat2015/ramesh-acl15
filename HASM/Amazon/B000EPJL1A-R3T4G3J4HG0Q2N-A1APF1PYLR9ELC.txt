Title: Looks Great - Sounds Bad
Content:
I ordered my i-POD shuffle and got it in a few days without any hassle.  It's a nice little item - easy to use and it looks good.  However...
The sound quality is not what you'd expect - even in a lower-priced player like this.  There is very (very) little bass.  I went out and bought a reasonably nice ($60) set of headphones thinking that would help.  Sadly, that actually exacerbated the problem - it seems the "muddiness" of the i-POD's standard headphones helps to compensate for the lack of bass from the unit itself.
The device works (though it does take a loooooong time to recharge), it has a very cool form factor...but I wish I'd purchased something else. - I'll call this an $80 learning experience and use the thing until I lose/forget it somewhere. - If you haven't made the purchase, then I strongly recommend looking at other products.

Title: Best portable heater I have ever owned
Content:
I purchased this heater on the recommendation of my wife, who was using it while waitinf for a new furnace to be installed. And my wife said it keep two large rooms warm. I ordered it for myself, and WOW. This heater is worth the money. Even my dog loves it. It has quartz heating, and a fan to blow out hot air. So it really heats a good size room very quickly. The heater starts heating right away, and the heat is going full blast in about 2 minutes. It works very efficiently, and I usually use it on the low setting. The heater is light weight and easy to move around. I will be purchasing another one, because it just works so well. At such an affordable price. This heater can be summed up in just one simple word "awesome".

Title: Fantastic device, just short of perfection.
Content:
I've had ipods before and hated them, but I heard the itouch was different and they were right. I love that it's basically a netbook that fits in your pocket with tons of features and a good amount of storage space. Browse the web, play games, music, take notes, has great business programs and such. 
Pros: fast, tons of programs available for great prices, easy to use, durable as hell, versatile. Good batt life for music (but not other things) 
Cons: Cannot replace battery by myself if it fails, or put in a larger battery like you can with other devices, Apple refuses to add flash player which limits websites you can go to (I'm guessing this is so it would keep people from making flash games for it), battery lasts maybe 2 hours if you play a game.
Overall it's an amazing device I just wish apple would be less restrictive with their devices and let more things work with/for it to make it even better. Even with these faults it's still amazing and worth getting. Stick with the 32/64gb versions since they have a faster/better processor and great amounts of storage.

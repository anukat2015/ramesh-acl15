Title: Too many cons
Content:
This is a good looking machine with too many cons, however:1) 4-5 parts need to be cleaned after each use, no exception2) it uses way too much coffee (compared to my old Krups).  The reaons: grinds too coarse and uses a basket type filter.  Most new coffee makers use cone type filter that extract more flavor from the coffee.3)Grinder whines and works for about half a minute, regardlsee how much coffee it grinds.  There is no control to shorten the grinding cycle.4) The carafe is nice , but very hard to pour from.  You almost have to hold it up side down to get the last cup.There are few pros, however:1) Keeps coffee fresh and warm for hours2) Easy controlsIt is expensive but not idiot proof.  If you forget to put the carafe in place, it will overflow.

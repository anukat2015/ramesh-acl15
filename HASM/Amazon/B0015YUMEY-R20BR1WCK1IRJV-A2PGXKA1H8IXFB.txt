Title: cook'in
Content:
Just retired and bought the 15" 2.4 Macbook Pro w/the 30" Apple Cinema Display and now I'm done. Put a fork in me. Initially I purchased this for my photo work but for the last month I've been having a ball just playing a cruising the net. Expensive yes but now it's my time (anyway that was the close I used on my wife).
90% of the time I use he Macbook as a desktop and it just screams. Elegant, beautiful and looks great in my studio (I can call my den a studio after what I paid for this toy)
Now, if I can use that same close on my wife for a BMW motorcyle.......

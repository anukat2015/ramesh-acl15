Title: tea fanatic
Content:
this pod brewer is perfect for teabags.  I liked the original "Home Cafe", but this model has just the right upgrades. I keep a cup in the chamber so I can come home from work, put in a teabag, and have a great cup of tea faster than with the microwave.  Too bad they're next to impossible to find in stores.  At least I know where to look if I need a replacement. Really great.

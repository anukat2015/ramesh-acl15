Title: coffeemaker
Content:
I love this coffee maker! All the reviews mentioned the water compartment was hard to fill and spills easy. NOT! I fill the compartment in the sink and set in in the coffee maker easily. The hardest part was the install and that's because we were replacing another under the cabinet coffee maker. Well, the wood (bottom of cabinet) over years had warped, but just had to use more spacers to make it level.
Makes great coffee! I love the new coffee caraf, it doesn't spill when pouring the coffee like the old model. Would recomend to anyone.

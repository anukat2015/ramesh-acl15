Title: A pleasant surprise
Content:
The Amazon service was prompt and the price was reasonable.  The product is much better than expected. Until I discovered the proper placement of my thumb, I made a few mistakes by unintentionally pressing various buttons on the back of the camera, but that was my error. The camera does very nice work. I should have bought it sooner. My suggestions to Canon: Include a memory card with the camera and consider a rewrite of the instruction manual.

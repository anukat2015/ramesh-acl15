Title: Works well but not value for money.
Content:
Overall, the product works just fine...it heats my 400 sq foot room pretty well. The air that blows out is a little on the noisier side, but not super noticeable. I think the unit looks attractive and high tech which is why it cost so much. Opposite from some, I really like the blue lights because it adds a nice aesthetic appeal to the unit. I ended up returning this because I got a $25 Honeywell heater (on clearance from Wal-mart) that is ugly but is quieter and works just as well. Also, I've seen $50 heaters at Home Depot that have remotes and look good (not sure how they perform) so I would expect a heater of this price would have one as well.

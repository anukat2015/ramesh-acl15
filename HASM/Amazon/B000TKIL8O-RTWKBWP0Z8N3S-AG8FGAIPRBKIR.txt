Title: Dayton Heater
Content:
I purchased this heater for a home office after using one for my actual office.  Additionally, there were about 10 or so other people in the office building that utilized these heaters.  I would say that the room sizes ranged from 12' x 12' to about 20' x 20'.  As an oil-based heater, it takes a few minutes to warm up and also warm up the room.  However, once it gets going, it really does a fantastic job.  This particular heater, I believe, is also made under the brand "New Air."  I ultimately chose this heater over other heaters because it is 1) very thin and takes up very little space, 2) it takes up only 400 watts (unlike most other heaters that take up 1,500 watts), 3) it works very well, 4) it's completely silent (great for speaking on the phone) and 4) I believe it's safer than coil-based heaters.  Since this heater is used in a space that has a multitude of other equipment pulling a good amount of wattage, the low wattage was a primary consideration.  In fact, the actual office building chose this heater to replace the other original 12 or so heaters because the other heaters were constantly tripping the circuit breakers due to over-utilization of electric power.  While it would be nice to have a digital switch to set automatic shut-off and temperature, there is a manual dial where you can set the temperature in the room by turning the dial until you here a "click," which will cause the unit to keep the temperature at that level.  All in all, I'm very pleased with this heater and would recommend it to others that are interested in safety, preventing circuit-breaker tripping and silent running.

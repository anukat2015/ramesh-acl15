Title: Very Nice Piece of Work
Content:
I tilted toward a Canon because I was able to adapt some of my considerable investment in Leica lenses to a Canon SLR body. The camera is pretty much flawless. The software bundled with it is decent, but I mostly use iPhoto. If you are looking for photo management software, the Canon software should be adequate. The lense that it came with does not get great reviews - it's adequate - a bit soft, and not a lot of contrast. I added a Sigma zoom/macro lense, with which I've been very happy. After buying the camera, a second Canon lense wasn't in the budget. If you are an indoor available light photographer, I wouldn't count on this camera (or any DSLR, for that matter), but for most purposes, it's hard to beat. The high speed shoot with bracketing capability is a very nice feature. Nearly all the menus are understandable without reading the manual, which is refreshing for a modern piece of digital equipment. I drag the thing everywhere, and while I try to take care of my gear, it's gotten a bit of a beating, without any problems. I still carry my Leica with it's wide angle lenses; it doesn't seem likely that the Digital Rebel will be able to replace them, but for most of my work, it's a winner.

OK - this won't be a long review, but I just want to get my 2cents in... I've used Nikons for 25 years (ohhh, I'm getting old...). I had a Nikon D70, and I was "this close" to giving up on Nikons -- that camera was a serious lemon. It was just no good. But after reading many reviews and talking to fellow photographers, I ended up getting the D300.  And I LOVE IT! It's really an awesome piece of equipment. Sorry I lost faith in you, Nikon -- way to go...

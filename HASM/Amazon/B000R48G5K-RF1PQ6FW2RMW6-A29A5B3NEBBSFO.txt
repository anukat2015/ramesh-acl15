Title: Great little cooler
Content:
For everyday use it makes a great fan and air ionizer/cleaner. It has an oscillating fan which you can direct up or down as it swings left and right to blow air all around the room. And it really helps on hot days if you add ice or cold water and turn on the Cool-Air function. It also comes with a full-function remote which comes in real handy. Best of all it doesn't use much energy to operate. You can't really go wrong with this cooler for the price.

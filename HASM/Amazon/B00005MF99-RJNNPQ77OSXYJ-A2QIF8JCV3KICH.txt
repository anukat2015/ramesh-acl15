Title: Worst Coffeemaker ever!
Content:
DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!! I have never written a review on any product... but I feel so strongly about this that I felt the need to warn others. This is the worst coffeemaker I have ever owned. I have gone through two of these machines in the past year. The first one I owned simply stopped working after about 3 months. I called Black and Decker and they agreed to replace it... if I paid for shipping and handling. They assured me this was not typical. However, now on coffeemaker number two, I came downstairs to grab coffee before leaving for work and this one has simply stopped working as well. Will not brew coffee by turning it on manually or setting the timer. Save  yourself the headaches and do not buy this machine!

Title: It works well when it's not broken
Content:
This vacuum is powerful and quiet. It's amazing to see how much more dirt it can suck out after the floor has already been vacuumed by an old upright vacuum. Unfortunately this vacuum isn't very solid. I only had it for about 6 months (and it wasn't heavily used either) but it broke twice. First the joint between the handle and the main vacuum head broke, causing the handle to get stuck. I took it to a Hoover store and they replaced the joint. Now the small vacuum head (the one you use for staircase etc) is broken and I yet have to take it to the Hoover store again.
Also, for those of you who have been using upright, bagged vacuums, you may want to think about it before switching to a canister, bag-less vacuum. Emptying a canister full of dust and dirt into a trash can isn't a pleasant experience.

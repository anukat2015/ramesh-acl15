Title: Customer service disaster
Content:
Dell has apparently taken a new attitude of making it as difficult as possible for customers to contact them. Any number you call will turn out to be wrong. You'll be told to call another number, which will also be wrong, but you find that out only after waiting 10 minutes on hold. You will be told you're getting transferred to the right number ... you'll wait, and wait, and get disconnected. You call again, and wait, and wait, and wait on hold, then get somebody rude who tells you they can't help with anything without you digging up your customer number, order number, or blah-blah-blah. Once you give them that, they transfer you ... right back out to the same queue you had been waiting on. A formerly great American company has decided the customer is their enemy. You need to return fire.

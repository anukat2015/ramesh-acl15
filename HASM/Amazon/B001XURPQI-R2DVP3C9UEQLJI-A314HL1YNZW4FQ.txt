Title: Review for common people
Content:
I did my home work before buying this camera, after 8 months I consider my purchase as a great one.
The camera can do more than I need or can do, because is full of features, picture is great, soft?
work on the settings, video very good quality, and this feature you don't ge it in a camera this quality.
A good set of lenses and your ready for taking great pictures, family events, nature, sports, videos.
Takes a litle time to master some features, but you can decide how far you want to go, not the camera.
Flash is good enought, but no more than that, if you take photos to a far distance objects get a external 
better flash.

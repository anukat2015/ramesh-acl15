Title: IPODs doesn't have FM radio..
Content:
My fiance got this for me on my bday. I like it at first until it freezes on me several times. I had to reset after it happens and then it erases all my downloads. Downloading your stuff to this is slower than the IPOD. I still like it because the fact it has FM radio which I can switch to when all my downloads sounds boring. Pictures, music, movies, etc looks better than the IPOD I had. I just wish it doesn't freezes a lot when I'm in a hurry for work....

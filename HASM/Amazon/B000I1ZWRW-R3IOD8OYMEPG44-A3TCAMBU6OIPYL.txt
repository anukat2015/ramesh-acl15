Title: Great camera!
Content:
I purchased this camera for my daughter who is a photography major.  The camera has many options for the professional photographer in addition to the ease of use for a occasional user.  She was using it from the moment she opened the box.  Only additional item I needed to buy was a memory card and I would suggest the bigger the better for this 10.1 MP camera.  I also purchased a Canon camera bag which included a battery and filter.  Very nice camera.

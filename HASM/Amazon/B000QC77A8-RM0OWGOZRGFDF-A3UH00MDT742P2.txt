Title: Lasko 758000 heats bonus room as good as gas heater
Content:
Unfortunately this is made in China instead of the usa.  It did heat my bonus room to a temperature that is very livable... I decided not to use my natural gas ventless heater because is smells and gives of carbon monoxide (regardless what the manufactures of gas ventless heater say!!).  My bonus room is over the garage and approximately 16x20...
Satisfied but could use a thermostat so on low it doesn't keep heatling up the room
Also, I hate supporting a communist country!!

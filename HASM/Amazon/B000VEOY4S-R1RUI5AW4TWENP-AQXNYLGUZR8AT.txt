Title: Power Rug Attachment Not Powerful
Content:
I've just run a test drive on this vacuum, and I have 3 dogs so I can verify there is a lot of fur and dander in my carpets.  The vacuum has a LOT of suction power, which is fine for hard floors; the rug attachment DOES NOT do anywhere near good enough job on the rugs.  I know, I'm crying great big tears.  Back it goes.

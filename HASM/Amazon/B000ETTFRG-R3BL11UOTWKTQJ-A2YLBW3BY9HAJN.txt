Title: Got for great price, but would not recommend it
Content:
First of all, I hate iPod's.  I want something that can plug into a PC and read/write like a stick drive.  Sansa's are great for that, but it won't accept storing non-media files, which would be nice if it did.
This device has pretty good battery life, voice recording, sound, interface,  the buttons/thumb-wheel is a bit frustrating, and it doesn't play a lot of mp3s that I have that play on other devices just fine, I'm not just talking about a few mp3s, there're many cases and it's extremely annoying.  I even tried converting the mp3s in wmv format and it still doesn't work.  Not only that but all files need to be tagged precisely in order for the unit to recognize albums/files.
Best part is that I had to move in a hurry and lost the charger cable,  and it's irreplaceable, and no stores carry it, so I'm going to pay $20 plus shipping and handling, or just purchase a cheaper unit that comes with it for 60 bucks, then I would have 2 units I'm not happy with!
iRiver has been the only units I've been %100 pleased with, not sure what happened to them.  I'm going to try another brand name.

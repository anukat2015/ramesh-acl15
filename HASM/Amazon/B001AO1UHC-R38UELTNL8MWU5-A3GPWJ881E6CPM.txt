Title: Pretty good ....
Content:
We decided to buy this before the heat wave hit this year (which it has not for more than 2 days) and so far it has been able to cool an 800 sq foot room about 3 degrees. It is only 80 degrees outside right now and it cooled the room to 78 in about 20 minutes. Mind you this is meant for a 6 sq foot room (we decided to just test it a little). 
It does have a strange smell to it...oil maybe? But, I would say it is worth the money for a portable a/c unit. The fan is about as loud as a normal stand alone fan.

Title: HP Mini 2140 is a little slice of Heaven
Content:
I bought this HP Mini 2140 for traveling .. carrying a 17inch laptop on cars, planes and trains is just too much for my old shoulders and hands!
This computer is a little gem .. she does absolutely everything that a bigger computer can do and she fits in my purse!  No more wheeling a computer bag to security checkpoints and hoisting it into the overhead compartment.  The 92% size keyboard is fine for my hands, I do not find it to be cramped at all.  It runs Windows Vista and Internet Explorer 8 and all of the Windows Office products with no difficulty whatsoever.  I definately would recommend this little computer to everyone.

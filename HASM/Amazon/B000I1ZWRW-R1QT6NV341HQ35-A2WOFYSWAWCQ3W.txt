Title: Very Pleased D400 Owner.
Content:
Bought directly from Amazon, and I swear by them.
Low price, reliability and fast delivery.
I am an old emulsion guy, went from film SLR's (ME Super, AE-1)
to point and shoot digital (A-620). I decided to plunge
into the DSLR field. I can tell you with sincerity, the
images that this camera produces is amazing. I shoot in RAW
and JPEG. 
Two reccomendations:
1. Buy the body only. The kit lens is a toy.
   Purchase the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8, great glass!
   It will be the best 70.00 that you will ever spend.
   Build quality does not equal "L" lenses, but the
   optics are superb.
2. Buy the Canon Battery Grip if you have large hands.
If you shoot in RAW, a CF card of 2GB is mandatory.
If you purchase this camera, you will not be disappointed.

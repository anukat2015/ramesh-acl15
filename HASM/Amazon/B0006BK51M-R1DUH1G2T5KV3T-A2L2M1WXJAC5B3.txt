Title: Everything I expected
Content:
I've had my Creative MuVo Micro N200 256 MB MP3 Player/Recorder for about a month. I bought it primarly for recording from my old records and cassette tapes. This player worked just as I hopped it would.  It took a little to figure out the contols, but that was no major problem.  Have transifered files to and from with ease.  Also, recording from analog devices and  transfering them my computer was a snap.

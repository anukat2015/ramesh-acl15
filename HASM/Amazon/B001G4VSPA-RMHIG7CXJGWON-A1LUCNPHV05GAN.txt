Title: Great product
Content:
Uses passive heat not fanned heat and while it may take patience to let passive heat warm up a room, it does the job nicely.  It's a lot like having a fireplace, even feels like one up close.  It's quiet and perfect for the bedroom and it heats the living room on high heat or bedroom on low heat very nicely. As for heating cost, my first electricity bill after running it every day non-stop showed a $35 increase which includes, multiple cold-snaps here and Christmas baking in the oven so while it raised my bill some, it was not nearly as much as when I use my inefficient gas heater.  Thusfar, I am pleased with this product.  I may be back to write an update once I've had this item longer and see how it works for me longterm.

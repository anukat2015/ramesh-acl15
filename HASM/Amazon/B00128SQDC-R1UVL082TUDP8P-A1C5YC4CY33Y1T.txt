Title: A really great camera to grow with
Content:
We were originally looking to get a D40 or a Canon Rebel.  We went to a big box store just to see how the cameras actually felt and picked the D80 up just because it happened to be next to the other two models of interest.  
Our immediate impression was that we like the way the D80 felt in the hand better.  The top LCD screen and additional control wheel make a huge difference to the ease of use.  If you intend to take the camera out of manual mode a lot then the additional control and setting readouts is nice.
We ended up getting the D80 and a 18-70mm kit lens to start with (if you can do without a zoom lens I think I'd recommend starting out with the Sigma 30mm 1.4/f instead).  The D80 has been an excellent choice for us.  It is fine for basic shots and the auto mode works quite well for snap shots and the like.  The camera really shines when you want to be a bit more creative or take more control though.  I've used a D40 but have found the D80 manual mode much easier to use (due to the extra control wheel and LCD).
If you're just looking for an upgrade from a point and shoot which you can change the lens on and occasionally control manually then the D40 should be perfectly all right.  If you intend to run in manual mode more often or expect to get more into photography I think the D80 is an excellent camera to grow with.

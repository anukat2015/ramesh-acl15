Title: Nothing but trouble
Content:
I bought an Aplle iPod because I've always loved Apple products and needed an MP3 player I could take along with me anywhere. Oops..
The iPod shuffle was nothing but trouble. It would suddenly shut off for no aparent reason, refuse to start, refuse to stop, shut down as soon as I went to skip a song... I took it back after one week.

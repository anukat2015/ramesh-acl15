Title: The Keurig B70 is a Vibration Machine!
Content:
First off, the Keurig B70 makes great coffee. And the K cup system is great.
However, this B70 sounds and feels like it's grinding coffee. Every time one brews a cup of coffee, the machine vibrates before and after the cup is filled. If I leave a spoon on the drip plate, it will vibrate off. I've tried placing the B70 on various vibration absorbing materials, but it doesn't help. I've spoke with Keurig customer service twice, and they tell me this vibration is normal for the B70. I wish I could have seen it in action prior to purchase.

Title: Good for specific tasks.
Content:
I have had this a few weeks and here are my impressions of this vac:
Its not really as loud as i expected after some reviews, not quiet but what you would expect. Great on hardwood floors and vacuming corners, furniture, along baseboards, and spot cleaning on carpet. This vac is not designed for whole carpet cleaning. It gets warm as some others stated. Not hot but I carry it instead of drag it and the handle warms up pretty fast but its not bad. Loads of suction and very lightweight. Pretty nice cord length so you can cover a large area without unplugging. 
Bottom line if you are looking for something light to do spot cleaning and hard surfaces this is a good value. Would purchase again.

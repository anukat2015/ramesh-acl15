Title: Looks solid
Content:
The Zen Micro looks great to me, better than the iPod mini and equal to the Rio Carbon.
Pros:
+5 GB Seagate drive
+Great sound quality (all of Creative's players)
+Synchs with Outlook
+Looks cool
+Removable battery
Cons:
-Requires software to transfer music
-No tactile buttons, all touch sensitive.
And to the fool zip, iRiver was out before the iPod, so your point is moot.

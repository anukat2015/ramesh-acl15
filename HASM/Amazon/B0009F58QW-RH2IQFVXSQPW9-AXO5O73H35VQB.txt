Title: Good solid machine for small spaces
Content:
We bought this unit to cool a computer server room, and it's been very effective.
It's been in continuous operation there for three years and it still blows just as cold as it ever did with temps never above 75 even in 100+ heat.
Granted this unit will not cool down an entire house, but for one small to medium room at a time it's just fine.
Be prepared for allowing for drainage though. Over a two day weekend with 30-40% humidity, this unit puts out about 5 gallons of condensation water, so either arrange for drainage, or expect to swap the tray frequently. The tray is small and kind of a pain when it's full so keep a mop handy.
I also have to second what others have said about noise. When the compressor kicks in it does get fairly loud, so it might not be the best thing for the babys room.
Bottom line, it's not without faults but it's worth the money and it'll last forever.

Title: For the Price,This Machine Gets It Right ,
Content:
I am a hard sell when it comes to coffee makers. Over the years I have bought and subsequently returned, or trashed, more machines than I can remember. I had actually gone back to brewing manuallly with the cone and boiled water. Then last February I was furnishing a new office. I desparately scoured the market once again for anything that had the basics of a good machine and that was not rediculously expensive. In a last ditch effort, and with very low expectations, I bought the West Bend at Walmart. I was very surprised! This machine gets it right. The water is hot enough, the caraffe is easy to pour and easy to read, the warmer is not too hot, all the grounds get soaked evenly, its fairly fast, and it does not spatter or overflow - and it turns out a great cup of coffee.
The Espresso side does okay, too, although it did spatter and make a mess, (I haven't seen one in this price range that doesn't), it was easy to figure out, easy to clean, and it makes a decent latte. 
I recommended this coffee-maker to my next-door-neighbor, she bought it and I have used it several times. Again, no problems, excellent coffee. 
For the money, you can't go wrong with this one.

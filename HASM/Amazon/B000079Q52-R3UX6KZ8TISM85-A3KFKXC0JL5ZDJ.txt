Title: ms-10r reflective heater
Content:
I bought one of these reflective heaters for my 88 year old mother for Christmas. Then I bought one for myself, my daughter, and my best friend. I think they are great little "body" heaters that make you feel warm instantly. They certainly create no noise like the "roar" of my old 1500 watt air blowing/entire room heating heater. I hope they last a long time. Though I do agree with many other reviews that they are a little bright if you have it shining directly at your face. I just put a pillow on my lap when I am reading to block the light. This way my feet get nice and toasty and I feel warm all over.

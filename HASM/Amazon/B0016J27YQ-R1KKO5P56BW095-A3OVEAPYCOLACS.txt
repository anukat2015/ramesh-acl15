Title: Just does not work
Content:
As with other reviewers, this unit provided no cooling for me at all, not even a half a degree, even after running it for hours. The air blowing out of the unit was basically room temperature, never cool. As others have noted, evaporative coolers don't blow air as cold as an AC, but it should be cool. I tried it with cold water from the fridge, the ice tray filled with ice, sitting next to a partially open window (this is needed with evaporative coolers to draw in dry air). I'm in Denver and the air was pretty dry. There are two main reasons I'd guess this unit is ineffective: 1) Quality control at the factory is poor. Some people say it works great, but so many people seem to get no cooling at all in dry climates that I say it's a gamble. 2) Poor design. The size of the filter where air is sucked in is small, no more than 12x14 inches. If you go to a home center and browse the coolers there you'll see that most have quite large intake vents, and the big ones have multiple intake vents (maybe it's in proportion to the power of the fan). Also, this unit has a pad (kind of like a wide belt) that rotates down into the water and up across the intake vent, but it must not be very effective at absorbing water. Most other evap coolers, even the portable kinds, use aspen filters (or similar synthetic filters) and pump the water to the top of the filter so it trickles down and saturates the filter.
I returned it immediately. 
Note: Air-n-Water charges a 15% restocking fee even if the cooler doesn't work. Just don't bother.

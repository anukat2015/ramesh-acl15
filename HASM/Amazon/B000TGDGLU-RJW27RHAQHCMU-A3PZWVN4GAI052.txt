Title: Nice but chipper at Wal-Mart
Content:
I bought 2 from Amazon, one for $40 and one for $50 (thank you for the free shipping). The radiator itself is perfect still don't know if I am saving money. However just yesterday I went to Wal-Mart and a similar radiator, again "DeLonghi" is selling for $35.
Amazon should do something about that. Or no one will buy one from them.

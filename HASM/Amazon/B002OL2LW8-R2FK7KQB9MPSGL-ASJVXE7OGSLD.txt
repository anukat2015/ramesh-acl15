Title: Toshiba M505D>>All about AMD & Toshi&lt;&lt;
Content:
Pros: Beautiful, Quiet, and Tres Kewl, Yah...
Cons: Very few, Amazon Mainly.
Quite the Laptop for the experienced user, and more than adequate for all.
I have many of these MXXX Series from Toshiba, and its all about AMD.
Finally, we have a chip that will blow Intel away @ same clock speed, hands down.
Buzzes the Ram like never before, and is extremely good on power management...I was shocked that it was only advertised as 2.2 hours, whereas on eco, it will go just over 3 and half
The new architecture of the M500 series chips along w/ the AMD 880 chipset, makes for one slick machine, not to mention a killer.
As a power user, I installed 8 gigs ram, Sammie M7E 320, and benchmarks prove, along with the general "feel" of the machine, that it is unstoppable. I put this baby up against any intel that is out there, and the boys say hum...well. Hard drive stock 326GSX Toshi is good for 52-55 mb/sec, while ole Sammie blows 77-78 all day long.
Amazon needs to get their pics/specs in order...as others stated no HDMI out, but I knew this when I bought; moreover, Toshi list their specs correctly on the website.
And yes, they are correct, they sold out on 12.14, as I bought them all...sorry folks!
I have these in HP, Toshiba, and you can't beat this hardware setup.
Keyboard is quite smooth, and for power users, ie, if you can really type, you have to go thru a learning curve, at least 2 sessions before you can fly above 150 words/minute.
Touchpad settings are junk from factory, but take your time, and set it slower, with less sensitivity, and you will love...
Hope this Helps,

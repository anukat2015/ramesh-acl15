Title: Hoover Rules the Hand Vacs
Content:
I've had a Hoover Wet-Dry hand held vac for years, but the new one is truly a little power house.  Cleans up the worst messes in seconds, and takes to a good cleaning in the dishwasher (non power parts, of course) with no problem.  I wouldn't buy anything else.

Title: a great little air cooler!!!!  I love it!
Content:
This little air cooler has saved my husband and me!! This unit cools down a room very well.  It isn't too loud and putting water in is not a hassle like I expected.  Once or twice a day i put a tray of ice cubes in the top section and it gives an extra chill breeze.  The reason why I opted for this cooler is because it doesn't have any drainage or hot air flow tubes that require an outlet outside like most portable air conditioners.  Also, this unit does not exhaust hot air out the back.  We keep it plugged in in the middle of our apartment and direct the air flow to whichever room we are in.  It isn't difficult to move, just a little sloshy with the water inside.  You will need a slender pitcher or container to fill the cooler; the opening is on the side of the unit and is a little small.  We live in a pretty dry climate and this cooler has been perfect.  I give it 5 stars for cost effectiveness, ease of use, and overall performance.

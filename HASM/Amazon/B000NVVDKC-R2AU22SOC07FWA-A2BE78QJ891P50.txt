Title: Not what I expected...
Content:
I guess it was my fault, but I bought this camera with only one lens.  The box came showing it was supposed to be a two lens package (both lenses shown on the outside of the package). I was under the assumption that I was getting a new, unwrapped item and not something that had been repackaged and sold with only one lens.  I don't believe Olympus meant for it to be repackaged and sold as it was. This disappointed me.

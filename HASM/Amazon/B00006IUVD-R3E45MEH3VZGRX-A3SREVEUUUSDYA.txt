Title: Four out of five stars
Content:
This product is excellent for brewing a single cup of coffee.  At my job, we are not allowed to have coffee makers that have a heating element, unless, like this one, they automatically turn off after brewing.  This fills the bill perfectly.
Okay, so my bosses are happy.  So how do I like it?
The good: The unit doesn't need paper filters, and you fill it with the cup you're going to drink from.  Unlike the pod coffee makers, you can control how strong you want the coffee.  
The bad: It can be tricky to fill.  The cup (like any coffee cup) really isn't made for pouring, and the reservoir is not exactly easy to aim for with a cup of water.  Have some paper towels handy.
Additionally, as many have noted, the unit occasionally splatters coffee grounds all over the reservoir and the filter chamber, necessitating a thorough cleaning.  This doesn't happen every cup, but is almost guaranteed if you put way too much coffee grounds in.
The resultant cleaning is very simple if you invest in a one-dollar bottle brush, and while I'll certainly second the manufacturer's warnings about immersing the unit, the reservoir and filter chamber can be well rinsed in the sink.  I let the unit totally dry overnight, and I'm ready to go the next morning.  This happens about once a month for me, and I use it everyday.
Also, I misplaced the original cup after the first week, but this unit works well with any coffee cup.  the flow from the maker to the cup is a nice gentle stream, so there's no splashing or percolating.
Well worth the bucks, even with the occasional hiccup.

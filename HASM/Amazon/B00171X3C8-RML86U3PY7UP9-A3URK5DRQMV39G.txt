Title: Good for the price
Content:
iriver has been one of the leading brands when it comes to electronics. The E100 is not the exception. At its amazing price of $85,, the E100 offers what you are looking for in an Mp3 player. However there are a couple things I don't like, it doesn't support that many video formats and the conversion it's not the best option. Another thing I don't like is that it sometimes doesn't respond to an obvious click, meaning that sometimes it won't respond when you press a button. And the last thing is that it gets slow when you charge it with too much stuff. Overall it's a good product.

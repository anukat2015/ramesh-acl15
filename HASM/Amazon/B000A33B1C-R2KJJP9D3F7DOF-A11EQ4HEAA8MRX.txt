Title: Uh Junk
Content:
Seem like it was a good unit, until it broke after using it maybe 10 timems. I asked for service. "Nope sorry cant do that" was De'longhi's response. My response is to never buy another product of theirs again. Just my experience but may be yours tommorow if you buy a De'Longhi. ;)  Stay Warm.

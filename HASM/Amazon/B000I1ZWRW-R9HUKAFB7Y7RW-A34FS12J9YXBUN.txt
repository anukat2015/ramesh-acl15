Title: Overall a good camera but BEWARE OF UNDEREXPOSURE!
Content:
I returned the first XTi I received because all pictures were underexposed and after a few weeks of use a permanent green pixel appeared in the picture display.  It was a fairly large green pixel.  This prompted me to return the camera.  The second XTi I received also underexposed every picture.  I called Canon, sent the camera in for recalibration (shipping, handling, and recalibration were all covered by the warranty), and received the recalibrated camera within two weeks.  The recalibration worked however just this past weekend, a small green pixel appeared in the picture display.  It is not as large as the first camera's green pixel.  Nevertheless, I am concerned that two XTi cameras have had this green pixel appear within a few weeks of usage.  My Canon Powershot S80 has gone through 2 years of tough wear and tear with no such green pixel appearing on the picture display.  
Overall, I am happy with the camera but have quality concerns.

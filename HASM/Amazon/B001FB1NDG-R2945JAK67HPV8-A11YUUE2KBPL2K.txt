Title: Good Stuff!
Content:
It reads almost every format except for .mpg files for some reason. Best video working extension is .avi files. Everything else is great on it. There is an icon that says, "calender" but no calender in it, instead its just "stop watch, and something else". Also in games, one game is included, "tetris" I wish there is more. 
In other use, this work great as an external hard drive. Its definitely worth it for the price.

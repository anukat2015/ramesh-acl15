Title: Terrific backup indoor heater for emergencies
Content:
I bought this heater for emergency use due to the awful snows and severe cold winter weather we experienced this winter.  Like the shape/size.  Tested it out and it heats up a large area pretty quickly.  Only drawback is the kerosene fumes, which are present even with 1K clear kerosene at the beginning.  I think if we had been forced to rely on the heater for our heat in an emergency, however, the fumes would have subsided.  It does a good job of providing comfortable heat quickly.  Recommended.

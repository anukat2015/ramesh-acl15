Title: Problem with the power switch
Content:
Got this camera kit from Amazon after reading reviews from a whole bunch of places about this camera. However the power switch was faulty. To switch on the camera I had to open and close the battery compartment every time while keeping the switch in ON position. The switch never worked. So sent it back. The return process was easy though, and I got my money back withing a week.
Now I have ordered a Pentax K10D. Hope it will work fine.

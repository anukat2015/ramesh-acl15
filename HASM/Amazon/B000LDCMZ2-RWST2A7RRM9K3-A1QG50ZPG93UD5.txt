Title: Very nice for the pice
Content:
Performed as advertised.  Was fairly easy to install into an existing wall. The instructions were clear and easy to follow.  The heater does make a little bit of an annoying whining noise when it runs, but you get used to it quickly, I only notice it if it runs at night when everything else is quite. Puts out more than enough heat for the average sized full bath.

Title: Photo Cell for kersoene heater
Content:
I ordered a new photo cell from Amazon and it shipped from Desa ( somepalce around Dallas). Arrived in 3 days, was as advertised and upon arrival installed in less than 5 minutes. Resolved the shutdown problem and now heater is like new. The test procedure is good reference. The photo cell has very high resistance ( someplace in meg ohm range) when no light available. With a 60 watt bulb the resistance should be below 500 ohms ( not a fully closed contact). The new one has about 45 ohms resistance with a 60 watt light source and apparently the flame has a light source about the same intensity as a 60 watt bulb. Safety swithc now works as it should.

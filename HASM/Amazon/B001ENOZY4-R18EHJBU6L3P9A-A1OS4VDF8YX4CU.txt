Title: Great camera
Content:
The Nikon D90 is outstanding. My family can't believe the pictures that I'm taking since I got the camera. The camera has a lot of bells and whistles. It's takes a good time learning the camera but it's worth it. Would recommend this camera for anybody that enjoys a well constructed camera.

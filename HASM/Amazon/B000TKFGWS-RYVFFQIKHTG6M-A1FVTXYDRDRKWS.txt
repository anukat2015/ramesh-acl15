Title: Vibrates floor
Content:
We bought this at a local store. Great little heater. Heats our small room quickly, especially on the oscillate function. The fan is pretty quiet; however, it vibrates a lot. It vibrates the floor and even our kitchen table! We tried to put it on a rug to see if it would help, but it only helped a little bit. The vibration noise is like a dull bass feeling in the bones, like when you know a big truck is parked outside, idling it's motor. The heater kicked off for a few minutes, then when it went back on automatically it startled us! It sounded like a plane just landed abruptly in our kitchen! A nice heater except for this. It set our nerves on edge after just a few minutes of this constant vibrating growl. We are returning it. Maybe it would work for you if you aren't too sensitive to noise and vibrating furniture.

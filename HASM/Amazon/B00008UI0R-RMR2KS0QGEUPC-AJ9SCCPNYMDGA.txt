Title: works great
Content:
I've had my vacuum for a few months and it works fine.  It picks up a lot of dirt out of the carpets because the canister is full every time I vacuum the house.  The canister is easy to empty without getting dirt everywhere.  It has good power.  I'm very happy with it.

Title: Doesn't Suck
Content:
What decided me on this vac was the rotating brush. Upon use, however, I discovered the brush to be a useless gimmick. The brush only rotates because of the air rushing through the vacuum. It is not motorized. The tiniest bit of hair or dust will stop it dead, and even when rotating it is of doubtful utility. Also, this vacuum is WEAK. I have a hand-held Eureka that has more power.

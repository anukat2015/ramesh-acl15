Title: Good starting DSLR that will grow with you.
Content:
I upgraded from an earlier version of this line to the XSi and have been very happy with both cameras. My primary use of the camera is nature photos to display in my home. I chose to upgrade for the greater number of pixels so I can increase the size of my prints. The camera is simple enough for a beginner and deep enough for a student of photography. Cannon support is good and accessories are easy to find. I would definitely buy this camera again and recommend it to all of my friends.

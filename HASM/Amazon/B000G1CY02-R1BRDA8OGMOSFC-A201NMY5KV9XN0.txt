Title: nice little heater
Content:
I've had it for a few weeks now and I'm quite satisfied.  I have an 18 x 15' bedroom that I put this little thing in and it takes care of it quite nicely.  At 1500 W it uses 1.5kwh / hour I pay about 8 cents / kwh where I live so the cost per hour of use is:  12 cents.  use it for a whole day (24 hours) $2.88... 
I use it on average about 6 hrs/day so i expect it will raise my elec bill by about $22.  It's a good deal.  It was -15 degrees the other day and I used this. It performed quite nicely.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Title: Nice furniture poor heater
Content:
The piece looks great, was easy to assemble and functions well as a media console under my wall mounted tv. 
However the amount of heat it produces is far less than I expected. The box stated it can supply supplemental heat 
for a 400sq ft room. I can only feel the heat within 1ft of the fireplace. I will be calling dimplex to see if there is something wrong.  So far I would recommend only if you don't want much heat.

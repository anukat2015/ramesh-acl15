Title: Excellent Digital
Content:
I know that these are no longer on the open market, so my review is simply to explain why I think these are an excellent value on the used market.
Bottom line is this - unless you are going to blow up your photos to poster sized, the 8MP XT is a great choice. The upgrades to later versions give you a larger display screen, sure, but the basic functionality doesn't change much for at least two generations.  While I'd like to be able to preview the picture in the display (which you can't do on this model), the quality of photos as well as the excellent feature set (all laid out in other reviews) make this an excellent choice.
Combined with the incredible array of excellent lenses, the compact size, excellent battery life and great feature set make the Rebel XT a great choice on the used market.

Title: Coffee made simple
Content:
This Capresso machine replaced an old, but reliable, Krups coffee maker with a thermal carafe. A good friend (and coffee snob)owns a Capresso espresso maker and uses it daily, so I was familiar with the brand. A bit pricier than other makes and models, this one is sturdy and well-designed and looks sharp on the  kitchen countertop. It's a bit shorter than my old coffeemaker which makes it easier to pour water, and gives you more room, if you keep it below your cabinets. The only thing to get used to is the screwtop lid, which must be adjusted perfectly to pour coffee. It is marked with a small raised button, so you can see where the lid must sit for pouring. Other than that, this is an excellent maker, which brews a full pot in a 3-4 minutes. Happy brewing!

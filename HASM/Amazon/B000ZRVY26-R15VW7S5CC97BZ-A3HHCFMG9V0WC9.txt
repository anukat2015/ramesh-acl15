Title: depends on your needs how well this will work
Content:
The vent I was boosting is on the floor and I was hoping the AirFlow would work better than my Suncourt EQ2. I should have done a little more research online before buying. One website indicated that the AirFlow would boost 60% while the EQ2 boots 80%. My thinking was that two fans would be better than one. Unfortunately, that didn't turn out to be the case and the EQ2 does have more boosting capability.
However, the AirFlow works and the design is nice in that it fits into the vent instead of over the vent. My floor vent isn't in a high-traffic area so this feature wasn't a benefit since my EQ2 wasn't likely to be tripped over or kicked around. The flush design will work in a wall vent which is one advantage over the EQ2. The AirFlow and EQ2 generate about the same noise level.

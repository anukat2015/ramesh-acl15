Title: Piece of junk!!
Content:
We've owned this vacuum for less than 6 months. At first it worked great and I was very impressed with the suction and all the great attachments for cleaning pet hair. However, after about 4 months of use my opinion changed drastically! We're constantly having to take the vacuum apart in order to clean clogs that prevent decent suction. The brushes easily get tangled with hair and stop spinning. I've never had to clean brushes or unclog hoses as often as I do with this one. We don't have very high carpet, but for some reason the brushes don't spin at all unless the vacuum is set to the highest height. However, the height adjuster just broke so the vacuum is virtually useless now due to the brushes not being able to spin.
I have a Golden Retriever and vacuum 2-3 times a week however, this vacuum broke down faster than anything I've owned in the past. We had bought this to replace a Eureka Boss that had started to fall apart after 2-3 years of heavy use. I'll be trashing this Bissell and going out to buy another Eureka!

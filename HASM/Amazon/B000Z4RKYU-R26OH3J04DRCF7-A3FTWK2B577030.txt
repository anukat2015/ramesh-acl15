Title: Greate value for the price!
Content:
I purchased this product approximately 4 months ago.  I read the reviews about leaking, but decided to try it anyway since it was on sale for $19.99.  Although there have been a few instances of leaking, it's an insignificant amount and very simple to clean up so I never considered returning it.  The automatic timer is very convenient.  If I forget to time it, the coffee is done within a few minutes.

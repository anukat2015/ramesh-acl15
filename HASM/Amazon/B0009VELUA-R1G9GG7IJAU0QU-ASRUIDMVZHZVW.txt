Title: failure consistent with other reviews
Content:
Like the other one star reviews, ours failed in under a year--unacceptable for such an expensive product!  We bought this to replace an old coffee maker we inherited that drips everywhere when it pours.  We had been looking into thermal carafes and liked the on-demand concept as a sort of hybrid.  It looks very sleek, no glass carafe to worry about breaking, and the coffee gauge was cool.
We thought the negative reviews were being nitpicky, ok so it's hard to pour in the water which then leaks on the counter, it's just water.  Yes, the condensation drips down the back, again, just water.  But everyone was right, the water getting everywhere does mess with the electronics.  Within a half a year it was being finicky and wouldn't always turn on.  If we messed with the buttons and plugged in/unplugged a couple times it would eventually start.  Not what you want to be dealing with first thing in the morning before you've had coffee!  By 8 months, it completely quit.
We're not sure it's going to be worth the hassle and cost of shipping/calling for returns, just to get a replacement that will fail in the same way.  In the mean time, we're sticking with our old coffee maker with the leaky carafe.  It's old, ugly, and drips, but it still makes coffee.

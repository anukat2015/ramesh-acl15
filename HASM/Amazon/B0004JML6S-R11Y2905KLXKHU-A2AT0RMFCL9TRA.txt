Title: Good product, manual is unclear in several places
Content:
Very pleased with the coffeemaker; however, I had a difficult time setting the clock.  The manual wording seemed out of order.  I was never able to get the clock to stablize to show the time.  It would show it, but it would continue flashing the 8888 screen, apparently expecting me to enter a time to begin the coffee.  I only wanted the clock to be viewed and not programmed.  Anyway, it works very well and I guess I will go back to easier jobs like setting up computer networks!

Title: ****Dangerous defect even if the coffee is good****
Content:
The One:One coffee machine makes great coffee but after a week's use scalded me when a jet of pressurized steam and water shot out of the front at me. Four more attempts to use it, with a towel as shield from the steam and pain and mess offered three more &quot;geysers.&quot; An urgent call to customer service got me the &quot;overflow&quot; operator who could only take orders but not even a message to the real company. I've replaced the machine with a Philipp's Senseo which, so far, does as good a job making coffee but doesn't result in the burn ointment being needed.

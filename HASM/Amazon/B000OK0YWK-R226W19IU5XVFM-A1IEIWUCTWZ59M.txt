Title: Terrible Product
Content:
I tried this last night and it's horrible! The scroll wheel doesn't work as well as the iPod's. It's a cheap immitation. It's basically just 4-directional arrows underneath a wheel! The iPod blows this away. Also...the sharing feature is useless! Nobody else has one. Every time I turn it on there is nobody to share with. The social isn't so social afterall.
Now the major gripe...This thing is "chunky." It's ginormous! The iPod is so much more elegant.
In addition, I had major problems installing the software. None of my iTunes songs would transfer to the player after all the problems installing.
I'm returning my Zune and getting another iPod. I highly suggest if you are looking for an mp3 player that you sing another Zune and get the iPod as well. There just isn't a better player!

Title: Pros and Cons
Content:
Hey! I just bought my Apple MacBook Pro 13" and let me tell you, its great.
I'm a "begginer" audio/music producer and I use it for my home recording studio. It runs amazingly. 
Pros:
-Very fast and can run many apps at the same time
-Incredible design
-Millions of details that make it great, like the Multitouch Trackpad
-Comes with iLife 09 that makes your life easier with a bunch of incredible softwares for editing movies, pictures AND A RECORDING SOFTWARE called GarageBand. I don't use it 'cause I'm a bit higher and uso ProTools 8 (Digidesign) but it is awesome.
-Very light and thin.
-MAC OS X SNOW LEOPARD!
-Integrated iSight camera and mic
Cons:
-Only two USB ins
-NO MICROPHONE IN JACK

Title: Beware !!!
Content:
I assumed that installing out of the box, it would work and was surprised reading the install instructions to lower the thermostat to it's lowest reading and could not find the thermostat. There is none. It is an optional purchase. Without one, the unit is either on or it is off. Will update this review when installed.

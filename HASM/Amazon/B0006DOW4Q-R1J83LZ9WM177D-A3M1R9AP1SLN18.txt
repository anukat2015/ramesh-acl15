Title: Dualit Axis - A dangerous product?
Content:
This percolator makes a great pot of coffee.  Trouble is, it doesn't stop boiling the coffee after it finishes percolating.  Its warm cycle is too robust - makes me think the one I bought is defective or just not completely compatible with 110 current.

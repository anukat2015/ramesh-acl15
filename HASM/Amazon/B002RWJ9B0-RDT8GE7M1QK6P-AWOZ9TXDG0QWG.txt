Title: Smells like burning plastic and doesn't heat up the room
Content:
I just tried this for the first time and it smells awful. It gave me a headache. Plus, it didn't heat the room so an hour later I felt worse (headache and still chilly). Also, the controls aren't user friendly. If you put it on timer, you have to keep pushing the button until it goes to "0" before it will turn off. I am very disappointed.

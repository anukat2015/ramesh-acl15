Title: great for two weeks.
Content:
Worked great for two weeka until it started brewing tan water.  We owned the same one and loved it as it worked for 5 years and then died due to corrosion of the wiring.  This is the second one that died on us in the last three months.  Oh by the way we followed directions exactly as written.

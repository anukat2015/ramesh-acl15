Content:
My mom got me this zune for christmas, I had been anticipating the mp3 player for like 4 months. I had my mom install it on the computer because when i tryed it was to annoying and i was in a rush to play guitar hero 3. It took my mom about 3 hours to install it because we had to upgrade programs and they weren't working but after a bit i came over and just went by the directions and bam! it worked. I have about 200 songs and 2 shows on it, its awsome. The image quality is mind blowing and trust me on this buy zunes over ipods. Ipods SUCK! they snap, crack, break, all the time buy a zune they never break.

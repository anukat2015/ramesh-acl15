Title: Great coffeemaker
Content:
I did a lot of research this time before I purchased a coffeemaker.  I had some preconceived notions that the research changed.  The research helped me make the right decision for a change.  This is a very good coffeemaker.  It is easy to load with both water and coffee grounds.  It is easy to program and easy to clean.  The housing does not leak, it is drip free when you interrupt the preparation, and the carafe does not drip when pouring.  I have purchased lots of coffeemakers, and this one is by far the best.

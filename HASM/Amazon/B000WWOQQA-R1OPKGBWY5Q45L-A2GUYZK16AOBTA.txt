Title: Lack of Lasting Quality
Content:
First, notice that the HP website advertises an HD DVD drive but this computer does not have one.  This is a misprint on HP's behalf because they have a customizable version of this computer available although this version is not customizable.  
This is not why I give this computer 1 star however.  Within a year and a half, I have been through a hard drive failure, graphics card failure and a motherboard failure.  This computer has no lasting quality.  I like many others spent a lot of money to get a reasonable computer for the price only to end up with added bills as parts break.  
If you get this computer, get the warranty for at least 3 years.  The features might be good, but the quality of the parts aren't.

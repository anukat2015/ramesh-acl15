Title: I am so addicted to my coffee
Content:
The kids own a Keurig with all the cute little K-cups, so we bought one. Sent it back in a week when it quit. A couple of weeks later we sent the faulty no-good replacement back. Now we have entire boxes of K-cups to send to the kids.
I luuuuve this coffee maker. I am a machine klutz, very fearful of failure, but I can sprinkle ground coffee in this, pour some water in the thing on the side, and push the on button. No matter how many Starbucks I buy, the coffee I make in this Cuisinart is the best stuff out there - and mucho cheaper. Who knew?

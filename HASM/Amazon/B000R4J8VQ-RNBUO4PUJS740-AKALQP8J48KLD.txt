Title: So good I bought one for home and for work
Content:
I bought one of these for work and a more expensive model at home.  I found that I liked this one better because it is not dependent on any size cup.  The more expensive machine had to be used with the cups that came with it.
This one has a stand for smaller cups and you can fit in taller cups without the stand.  This is a great feature so the water doesn't splash as it drips.
The water always comes out very hot and brews the coffee or tea perfectly.
I really enjoy and recommend it.
I ended up putting the more expensive one in the garage (the "garage sale" pile) and getting another one of these for home!

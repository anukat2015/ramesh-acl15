Title: Had high hopes but died second time I used it
Content:
I had done a good bit of research on bagless vacuums.  I was reluctant to "invest" in a Dyson or Oreck and this model seemed to get overall good reviews.  I was pleased with it the first time I used it.  It got the job done, was fairly lightweight and easy to store and attractive as far as vacuums go. Upon plugging it in for the second use, I powered it on and it died.  I called DirtDevil Customer service to see if they had any suggestions and was told to either return it to the merchant or they could send it out for repair.  Given the short time I've had it, back to Amazon it goes.  I'm now considering if the more expensive models may be worth the price...

Title: As good as it gets for under $50
Content:
The truth is there are legitimate complaints about any coffeemaker you can get for less than $50 and most costing much more. I had an older version of this and it occasionally drove me nuts by overflowing. But after looking into all the alternatives, I reluctantly bought a new one just like it. 
The good news is that the basket fits much better than it did in the old version and doesn't seem prone to overflowing. So far so good. Given the complaints I read about every single coffeemaker I looked at, I think this really is the best bet for a basic unit.

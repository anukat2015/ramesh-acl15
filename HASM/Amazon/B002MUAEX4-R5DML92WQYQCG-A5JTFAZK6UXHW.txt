Title: epic camera
Content:
combination of image quality, form factor, and ability to change lenses has made this my favourite camera by far. its like a good entry level dslr crammed into a chunky point n shoot.
i dont understand how anyone could rate this lower than 4. before i bought this camera i read the bad reviews first, and i would suggest you do what i did and ignore them.

Title: Works like as advertised
Content:
Bought this for camping. Used it in a 8 x 9 wedge shaped tent. It was exactly what I needed!  Simple to use and certainly kept the cold at bay on a night in the low 20s.  Bottle lasted approx 3 hrs at 9k btu.  I might recommend a larger tank & extension hose if you wanted to run the heater all night and avoid getting up.

Title: a fantastic heater!
Content:
Just back from a cold and rainy columbus day weekend camping trip in the White Mountains, and this heater was the item that saved the weekend! on a cool night(45deg.) this easily brought the temp inside my large coleman tent above 70(it was downright hot!). On a raw rainy afternoon my daughter and I could tough-it-out in great comfort in the tent. and the following 35degree morning was nice and toasty inside! This will definitely increase the enjoyment and comfort of your "shoulder season" camping. In an emergency I've little doubt that this could easily heat a 9x12 room. 
Lights quickly with no matches, wide base is very stable, fan is quiet and really makes a difference in heating a larger area, no odor/fumes. unit is larger than it looks, standing about 15" tall...but it fits in an old bookbag size backpack for easy transport.
*update 9/04*** After reading a lot of hoo-ha about CO and heaters I tested this unit with my home CO detector. Running for an hour in my closed tent the heater never moved the detector above zero. I'm comfotable that at the, relatively, low reaction temps of the catlytic heater there's simply no CO generated. CO2 is another matter and ventilation is still critical!

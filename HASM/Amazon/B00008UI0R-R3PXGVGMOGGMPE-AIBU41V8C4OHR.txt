Title: Worst vacuum ever owned
Content:
This vacuum is a lemon and I want to return it. The belt continually comes off and you have to unscrew the entire piece to get it back on.  It continually clogs and have to  actually put a rod down into the want to get the clog out.  It fills up after one vacuum and we continually have to  empty it and clean the filter.  I feel that i have been ripped off and wnat my money backand want to know how to return this lemon.
Very unsatisfied.

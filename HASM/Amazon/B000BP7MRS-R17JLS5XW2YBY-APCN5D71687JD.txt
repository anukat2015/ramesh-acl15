Title: Great value, great coffee
Content:
Nothing fancy, just makes good coffee.  Using it for an office; it makes several pots a day and is still going strong.  In my opinion, cone filters just make better tasting coffee.  The gold foil reusable filter basket is nice, but I still use paper filters to make clean-up easier.

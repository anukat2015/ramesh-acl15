Title: wonderfull when it works
Content:
This vacuum is very quiet and does a good job, when working
within weeks the telescopic wand gave troubles, and I must say Bosch was happy to replace it and within days I had a new one
Now, my vacuum is almost 2 years old and it only worked when wiggeling the cord, 
Bosch has very little repair centers, they want me to send it to NY for repair! A local repair shop told me needs new mother board, needs new reel with cord, cost over $ 300!
So no thank you, I rather have a Dyson, they are more powerfull anyways and you don't spend a fortune on bags!

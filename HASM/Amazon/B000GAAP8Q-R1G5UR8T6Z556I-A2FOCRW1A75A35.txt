Title: can't compete with iPod...
Content:
This iPod is just awesome... if you want to get an mp3 player, there is no doubt about getting an iPod... besides, think of all the accessories available for iPods.... that doesn't happen with other mp3 players... 
There is only one thing I don't like about it and that's why is not 5 stars... Apple should fix the fact that the iPod will repeat many songs when shuffle mode is being played and never play some others... you can see how many times the songs have been played by connecting your iPod to your pc and opening iTunes. You will see that some songs were played 15 times and some others were played 0 times... 
everything else is just perfect...

Title: A Good Player....But Lots of Add-Ons!
Content:
*******************************************
So far- this Archos Media Player
has been pretty good....
the screen is an ok size,
and learning how to use all of the features
is fairly simple!
160GB is quite a lot of space- 
compared to some of the cheaper models.
You can definitely fit a large amount of your 
favorite files.... including Audio and Photo files!
There's a nice little speaker built right in,
so you don't have to use earphones.
I have the player set up on my night-stand 
so I can use it just like a little TV.
The battery is good for about 3 hours 
before you have to re-charge it....
which gives you enough time to watch
a full length movie, or a bunch of assorted video-clips.
I always try to run my battery right down 
before letting it charge again- 
and that seems to keep the battery healthy.
It will automatically begin to charge 
when you plug it into your PC-  which is ok. 
And keep in mind-  that I haven't purchased
any of the major Add-Ons.
I'm just using all of the basics.
There are all kinds of Add-Ons and Plugins 
to buy for the Archos 605.
Some of them are very important to have,
depending on what you want to do.
For Example:
In order to play certain video formats 
including MPEG-2 - you will have to purchase 
and download one of the Plugins.
So far I've only been watching AVI files,
which is good enough for me....
You might want to play another format.
ALSO- 
To surf the internet....
Listen to FM Radio....
Play DVD files....
 
YOU WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE THE PROPER PLUGIN!
Like I said- there are all kinds of them.
To record directly from your TV
or to even plug your player into the wall....
You will have to go out and purchase 
all of the required accessories.
The Archos 605 is a pretty cool player,
and so far I'm very happy with it,
but please be aware that it only comes
with the basics.... everything else must be purchased.
If that sounds ok to you- 
then I say go ahead and buy it!
**** Quick Reminder****
There are now newer models available 
with bigger screens.

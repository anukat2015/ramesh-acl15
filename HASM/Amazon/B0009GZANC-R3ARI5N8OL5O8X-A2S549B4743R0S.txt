Title: Superb Value!  Minor moire issue!
Content:
Thanks to cameras like this, there has been explosive growth in the digital SLR camera business.  This is an excellent entry-level SLR camera which scales very well for the advanced user.  There is a significant learning curve for cameras of this type, but that is part of the fun!  Once you've commanded the basic principles of photography and learned to use the features of the camera, there is nothing you can't do in any situation!  I can't imagine ever going back to a traditional digital camera unless I need to keep one in my pocket for 'discrete' occasions.  The advantage with SLR is control!  You are not at the mercy of a digital cameras limited or inaccessible control features.
There is no need to fear!  This camera is designed for the SLR newbie!  It has all the standard automatic modes but implements them FAR better than any non-SLR digital camera (not to mention far more quickly).  However, if you really want to take advantage of this camera's unique capabilities, you will want to learn how to use it without the automatic features.  I consider this camera an investment; it has been instrumental in fostering my understanding of photography.  You won't be able to use it to its maximum potential right away so be prepared to practice extensively.
My only complaint, and I bring it up only because I haven't really seen it mentioned, is that the Nikon camera seems prone to producing moiré in some situations (like a car's radiator or thinly striped shirt).  This has been something of an annoyance and probably would be unacceptable for most advanced photographers, but is not a common occurrence in most of my photographs.

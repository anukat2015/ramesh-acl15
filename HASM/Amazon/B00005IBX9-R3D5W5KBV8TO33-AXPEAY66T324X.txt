Title: cuisinart 120 B not at all bitter. CHseries coffee maker.  and extra basket.
Content:
it was beyond my expectations . i have been using a bunn for many years.   but this is great that it is programmable to have coffee instead of making it when we get up in the morning. even though the bunn is a fast maachine.
the water must be kept hot in order for it to be that fast.  the coffee it makes is excellent and not at all bitter. we're very impressed. and it seems to take less coffee to make it.

Title: Great for running
Content:
Bought this player for running and it is perfect. I usually clip it on the waistband of my shorts, but it is small and light enough to go anywhere. 
It is my first mp3 player so I was unsure about loading music.  Have found it easy to upload and manage play-lists just using Windows Media Player.  Controls and menus are also easy to use.  Earbuds that came with it sound good, stay in when I run, and let in enough sound to hear oncoming cars.
Haven't tried the FM radio yet.  Would like them to add a clock/timer in the next version.

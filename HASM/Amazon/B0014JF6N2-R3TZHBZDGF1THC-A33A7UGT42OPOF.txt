Title: Great product for the price
Content:
I was nervous purchasing a refurbished item but I wanted a thermal coffee maker that didn't cost upwards of $100.  I definitely got my wish with this!  My only gripe is that the clock is small and dark making it a bit more difficult to see in order to set the timer, but it isn't impossible by any means.  I don't know if other models would be any better.
I love, LOVE the style.  Very easy to clean up, too.
Hopefully it'll last for a very long time.  If not, I'll be sure to let you know!
Update: it is a pain to pour coffee through the spout, especaially that last cup or two.  I think the newer models were redesigned. I like how it looks and how it is easy to clean.  But functionally, I don't love nor hate it.

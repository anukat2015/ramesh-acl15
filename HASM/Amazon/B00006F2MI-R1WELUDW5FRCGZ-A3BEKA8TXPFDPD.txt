Title: PIECE OF JUNK!!!!
Content:
I really cannot state any better what has already been said.  The engineers that designed and built this coffee maker should be fired and punished to a life of manufacturing paper clips.  This coffee pot may look pretty, but it is nothing but junk.  It is a time waster, I could drive to the coffee shop and back every day for the time it takes to set up and clean this coffee maker.
I've only had this thing for a month and this morning the basket door popped open while I was upstairs, slowly flooding my counter top with water.  That on top of the condensation problem, poor pot pouring design, too many plastic parts to clean, loud grinder, weak coffee, water leaks into internal parts, etc. etc.
STAY AWAY!!!  ZERO STARS!

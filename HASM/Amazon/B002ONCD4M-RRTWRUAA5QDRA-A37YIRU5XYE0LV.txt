Title: My disapointing purchase
Content:
I purchased the computer to use with Windows 7 professional in the XP mode.  It won't do this because it has the wrong processor.  I had looked quite a bit and was sure the Intel duo coes would work.  They don't and I would recommend any one wanting this function do the necessary research.  Nothing by Amazon or Microsoft gives you this info.  It is available at Microsoft; but, only a lot of digging.  Fortunately Amazon took the computer back.HP Pavilion DV6-1350US 15.6-Inch Espresso Laptop - Up to 8 Hours of Battery Life (Windows 7 Home Premium)

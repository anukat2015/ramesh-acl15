Title: Does Everything BUT Brew Coffee
Content:
OK, in fairness, I bumped this rating up from one star to two since it brewed a great pot of coffee while I was in the shower.
But this required several convoluted steps and extra minutes -- I had to unplug the unit and plug it in again after the blue LCD screen blanked out (this occurs frequently), then wait for several minutes while the machine synchronized the correct time and weather forecast.
As far as I can tell, there is no way to circumvent this several minute process and just get to the main function of brewing coffee. It's almost as if Melita designed the coffee brewing function as an afterthought to the weather forecast, barometric pressure reading and a sleeping cat that pops on the screen when the unit is inactive.
In addition to the highly anti-intuitive operation, the buttons on the unit function as if they were crafted in a sub-standard 1970's Taiwanese factory -- push a button and you get a result about half the time! This includes pushing the "on" button for it to start grinding and brewing. 
I often wind up setting a timer to activate brewing within two minutes when the on button ignores me.
Annoying!
I envision this unit going curbside in the not too distant future.

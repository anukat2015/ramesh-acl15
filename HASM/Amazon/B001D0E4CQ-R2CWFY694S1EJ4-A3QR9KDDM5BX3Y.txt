Title: good product but...
Content:
this is a very good product compared to other PMP's currently in the market. It has some minor issues like sometimes it freezes and you have to hard reset, still a bit bulky but manageable. I had the previous model which is the 605 160gb. compared with this when docking on the dvr station, the 605 was so much better. for this one you have to actually look for the slot to insert it or risk your unit getting scratched. the 605 has a guide that let's you dock smoothly.  
Also the most important part that everyone should understand, buy from a reputable seller like amazon. Archos customer service does not exist. And if you ever get someone on the phone, you will find that they are rude and arrogant. if your thinking about sending an email for questions about your unit, save your time, your not going to get any replies. so in short if something happens to your unit, your on your own.

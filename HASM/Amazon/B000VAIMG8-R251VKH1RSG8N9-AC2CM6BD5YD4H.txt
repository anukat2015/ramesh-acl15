Title: great mp3 player
Content:
I like this player very much. I bought this player to use when I exercise, it is small, lite weight and very easy to use.  Another reason I chose it was for the headphones, they are just what I wanted...very comfortable and they put out great sound.  I have a much larger player made by Creative, which is still going strong, but is much too big for what I needed it for.  The only area of discontent is the storage capacity. Sony will tell you that it holds up to 2000+ songs, but those songs all have to be about 2 minutes long.  I have close to 700 songs and I am almost out of space because most of my songs are 3-6 minutes long.
Make sure you chose the right capacity, beyond that this is a great player, you can't go wrong.

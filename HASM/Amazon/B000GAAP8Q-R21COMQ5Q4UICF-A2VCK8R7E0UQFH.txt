Title: Very stylish, but headphones must be replaced
Content:
iPod Nano is sleek and cool, the menus are intuitive, the display bright and easy to read. However, beware: if you are serious about listening to your music, you will need to replace the supplied headphones as they are totally inadequate. I recommend Sennheiser PX 100 - the white version, obviously, to match your iPod.

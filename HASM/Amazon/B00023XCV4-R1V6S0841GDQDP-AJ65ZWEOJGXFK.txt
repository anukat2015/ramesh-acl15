Title: a bad choice
Content:
I feel it was an unlucky day when I bought this pot.  As careful as I tried to be, it was extremely difficult to tell if I had correctly placed the stem (with basket) in the pit.  It had to be by "feel," and half the time it was apparently a hair's breadth off and would not perk.  Or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet.  It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot.  A hair's breadth off and again it wouldn't perk.  So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds.  I am returning to my old friend, the Farberware FC280.  It may or may not last more than a year but at least I can depend on it.

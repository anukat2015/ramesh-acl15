Title: My new best friend
Content:
I love this machine.  I purchased it based on reviews and am very pleased with it.
I have had failure after failure with vacuum purchuses no matter what I have spent.
This machine is nicely priced and does a top knotch job.  It is light weight so can 
be carried along, or rolled along, conveniently.  When it first arrived, I went a little
crazy because it is so versatile!  My home was vacuumed floor, to wall, to ceiling and beyond.
It has a great deal of suction, long hose with extention, and the cord is plenty long for my needs.
I have hard wood floors and short rugs for the most part in my home and have inside pets as well.
While vacuuming the floor, you can jump right up onto the couches and chairs to make sure no dust or
pet hair has made a home there.  If I notice cobwebs, I can just pop the attachment head off
and suck them up in no time at all.  Baseboards are conquered in minutes, corners are no problem, windows
can be freshed up from insects and dust accumulating on the ledges.  
I did read that some thought it was too noisy, that the attachments were inferior and that it became too hot.
None of these things are even notable in my opinion.  I am happy with this product.
I have owned this machine for a couple of months now.  I hope it has lasting power because I can
see myself being an Electrolux Sanitaire owner for years to come if it wears well.

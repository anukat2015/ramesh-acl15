Title: Sucky
Content:
Based in part on the glowing reviews on this site, I purchased this Bissell 6900 vacuum for our small condo.  Previously I used a Mighty-Mite canister vacuum for our place, but it has gotten quite old, the hose has a permanent crimp in it, and it never did a very good job on our few area rugs.  Most of our floor is bare hardwood, however.Turns out the Bissell is the exact opposite problem.  When I turn on the brushes, it does quite a good job of cleaning our area rugs, but when I turn off the brush, it refuses to pick up anything more substantial than a dust bunny from the hardwood floor.  It seems that the base is too wide to allow substantial suction, and there is nothing coming in contact with the floor to dislodge any stuck particles.  I dumped a small amount of fresh cat litter on the hardwood floor and tried to pick it up with the Bissell.  Very unsatisying, I could have done it faster and more thoroughly with a broom and dustpan.It seems that a different attachment would work much better for bare floors than the standard one with the brushes, but alas, the one that comes with the vacuum is only about 3 inches wide.  The claim that this vacuum works great for both carpet and hardwood seems totally bogus to me.  Some other notes:- It is actually very quiet with the brushes turned off.- Suction is also good, as tested by removing the cleaning head and using the various attachments.- Telescoping feature is nice, but sometimes doesn't lock in place correctly when going over bumpy terrain- Adjustible power feature seems kind of froofy; I'm not clear on what kind of person would say &quot;well, the floor isn't really TOO dirty, let's ramp down the power a bit today...&quot;Summary: I wouldn't recommend this vacuum for anyone with more than a few patches of hardwood floor.

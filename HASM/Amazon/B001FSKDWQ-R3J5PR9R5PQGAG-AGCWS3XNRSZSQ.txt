Title: No sealing against anything
Content:
To reduce size and proportion of a camera like this, Panasonic took off vital care with the product. It  has no kind of sealing, so it's open to any kind of moisture, dust and sand. The image sensor itself is open exposed when changing lens(read DPreview). Once affected you send it to Panasonic Service Center to fix and after months they will tell you its better trash it than fix it. As they did to me when I sent them my Lumix DMC FZ50. So, buy something else, like Cannon, Nikon or, like I did, a Pentax K20D, same price but a real SLR with all kinds of protection against moisture and dust.

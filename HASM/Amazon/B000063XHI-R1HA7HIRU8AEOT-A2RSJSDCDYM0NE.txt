Title: Working great for two years
Content:
I have been using this coffee maker for two years now.  It still makes an outstanding cup of coffee. The coffee is always great.  Hot, good strong flavor and not bitter. 
As for the lid, I'm too impatient to wait for the coffee to come out.  I turned the lid to the "dot" for about the first month.  It seemed to take an eternity to pour two "travelers" in the morning for my myself and my wife.  I soon learned that I could "spin" the lid open real fast with a single flick, pour two cups neatly VERY fast, then spin the lid back on.

Title: Too bright screen
Content:
I searched a lot for pretty laptops & you can't find a better looking one. It is fast, the only issue is DISPLAY, its just TOO BRIGHT. Even if you turn the brightness to lowest still its too bright, It sounds crazy that I am complaining about brightness, but as a result of this XBRITE thing the true colors are not visible (Black & white contrast is not good). It feels as if there is a semi transparent white color layer all over the display. I got 2 years old HP laptop (horrible in reliability) but still the colors on that are quite sharp. I heard similar complaints from my friend who got 18.4" VAIO (DISPLAY IS TOO BRIGHT). I have not checked SONY LED Display may be they are better.
I think SONY has to seriously look into this DISPLAY thing. I bought this for looks & reliability & for that it is 5/5.

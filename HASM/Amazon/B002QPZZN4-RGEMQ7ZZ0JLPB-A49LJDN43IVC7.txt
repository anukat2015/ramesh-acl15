Title: Excellent value, Easy setup, wonderful ergonomics
Content:
I bought this 3 weeks ago when the price was only $599.  It's a steal at that price.  It came well packaged, no damages and the setup was so easy.  One little annoying thing was the pre-loaded anti-virus software which seemed to always want you to register.  This laptop is recommended for those who like a good sized screen.  I am not one to suffer with those little netbooks (except for travelling).  But for prolonged, serious use, this is a really good sized, crisp display.  My old laptop had a crammed keyboard and it always gave me tired fingers.  This unit has a full keyboard with a real numeric keypad.  I appreciate the spaces between the keys, the feel of the keys are also very good.  I thought I would not get used to the touchpad slightly geared more to the left but I was wrong.  It took a few days to get used to it and I didn't miss my mouse (though I still prefer the mouse).  The processor is a good speed for the resource intensive MS Office 2007.  Internet setup was a breeze too.  Overall, this is a really good unit though if you plan to travel a lot with it, it is not the lightest unit around.

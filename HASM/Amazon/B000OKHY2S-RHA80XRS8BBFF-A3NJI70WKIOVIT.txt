Title: It simply did not work.
Content:
I do not live in a very dry climate, nor do I live in a humid climate. I didn't expect terrific results, but I did expect some. I would have loved a 2 degree drop from the normal room temperature, though I did not get this. I used cold water, and put in ice as well. I have a 250 square foot room. I monitor the temperature continuously. The temperature of the room never showed any sign of being affected by this cooler. I used it for a little more than a week. I am very disappointed in this product.

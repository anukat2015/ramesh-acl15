Title: Great features
Content:
I've used this camera for three or four months now and I'm very satisfied with it.  I'm not giving it 5 stars only because I haven't compared it to similarly priced Nikon and Cannon models, but I know that although definitely not for the point-and-shoot crowd, this is a good camera for intermediate to professional caliber photographers on a budget.  The biggest limitation would be the relatively small choice of lenses available, compared with the Nikon, Cannon, or Sony.  Also, the live view feature, while sometimes useful, really slows down the focusing and processing speed, to the point that I usually don't use it.  But it's still a nice feature to have.  The built-in stabilizer is particularly useful, and only a couple of other cameras have it built in to the body like this one.  I highly recommend forgoing the kit Olympus lenses and buy a good Sigma or higher end Olympus lens.  I'm using the Sigma 18-50 f2.8 macro, and it's great.  The kit 14-44 Zuiko is ok if you're only taking run-of-the-mill snapshots, but if that's what you're doing, why get a camera this sophisticated to begin with?  I used the Zuiko for a few weeks, but after getting the Sigma (available for about $375, but well worth it) I have yet to put the Zuiko lens back on.

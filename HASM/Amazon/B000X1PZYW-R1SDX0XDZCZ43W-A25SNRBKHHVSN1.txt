Title: Useless - will never buy HP again
Content:
I agree with all the posts associated to the HP DV6000.  2 hard-drives later and now about to have a 3rd replaced (since I have the 3 year warranty) in 1 year.  HP has guaranteed one lost customer and I will freely let everyone know my experience with their products (their printers are just as bad). Stay clear of HP!

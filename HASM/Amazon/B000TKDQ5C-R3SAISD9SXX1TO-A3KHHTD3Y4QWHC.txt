Title: I'd buy it again.
Content:
I bought this for my cubicle at work, because it's really cold in the mornings (and I get cold easily). I put it under my desk just to heat my feet, but it keeps my whole cubicle warm! At first, I was concerned that it would make too much noise, but it's not loud at all. The people who sit next to me did not even notice it. It's a great buy!

Title: Improved over 2nd Generation iPod Nano
Content:
Cheaper than what I paid for my 2nd Generation iPod and features which I consider this a good buy. Easier to navigate threw the menus by a more uniform touch around the circle " smooth operation". I thought the battery life could have been improved just a little which isn't a show stopper. I like that you can load and watch a movie on this iPod. The screen is small but watchable so you can break the boredom of waiting for a plane or at a doctor's office.

Title: The Search is finally over
Content:
After searching reviews and ratings on one cup coffee makers I could not decide on which to buy. I looked for weeks on end. I read every review out there and I still couldn't decide on which one to buy. I finally decided on the Keurig B70 and what a great choice that was. It is just a awesome machine. Not only does it look great it makes a great cup of coffee. I was always a Folger's coffee drinker, until the Keurig, I have not had gourmet coffee. Well needless to say I am hooked and there is no comparison to a good cup of gourmet coffee. The taste is smoother and richer with no after taste. The Keurig B70 makes a cup of coffee in seconds with no mess or clean up. I love my Keurig and I am glad I made the choice to buy it with over 200 different kinds of coffee to buy how can you go wrong.

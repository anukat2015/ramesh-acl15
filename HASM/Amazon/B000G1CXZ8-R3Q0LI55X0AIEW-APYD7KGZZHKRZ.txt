Title: Great heat
Content:
I couldn't believe the earlier reviews.  This is a very quiet item, and puts out great heat.  The remote is great.  I have this in my bedroom, which is quite large, and it will heat it up completely in about 20 minutes.  If I need heat when I am in bed, I just use the remote until it warms up.  
I have always been satisfied with Delonghi products and would recommend this one to anyone.

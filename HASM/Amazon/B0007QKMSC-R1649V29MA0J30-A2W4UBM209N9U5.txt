Title: Sad story about Canon Digital Rebel XT fill-in flash failure
Content:
I bought a Digital Rebel XT last april 2005 after taking a lot of information on this camera on internet websites and with retail stores. I chose up this Canon product for two major reasons, first Nikon D70 was not available at that time and second Digital Rebel XT + lense EF-S17-85mm IS USM seemed to be better and affordable choice. But 2 months and 24 days of use later, I feel very disappointed. When I tried to take pictures of my daughter receiving honors at her "gala meritas", the fill-in flash with loud clickety-clack noises refused stubbornly to pop up. It was impossible to take any pictures with flash even after the camera was shut off and reopened again. Each time an error message was appearing up in the viewfinder, blocking completely the use of the camera. And this is not the end of this sad story because Montreal Canon customer service is  very slow to handle up my request of service, at least 4 weeks. And don't try to ask questions to a Canon technician. Only the retailer is able to get a few information and answer you to wait because you don't buy at least a $5000 camera to have the right to get faster service. Really, really frustrating buying experience...

Title: Pretty, but not effective for a large roomI
Content:
I guess I bought this without thinking about the large space that I wanted to heat. Our basement freezes in the winter, so after reading the reviews here I bought this heater. It is amazingly lifelike and I enjoy watching it, however it does not do what I need it to. It blows out a little heat, and I could see it being fine for a small room, but not for what I wanted it for. I guess I will have to go with a stand up more forceful unit.

Title: Great Coffee - Stays Warm - Easy to Clean
Content:
We've had this unit for over a week, use it everyday, and are quite pleased with the coffee.  Nice design and very easy to clean.  Timer works well and the internal caraf keeps the coffee warm for hours even after the auto shutoff time.  Only downside is filling up the unit.  You can easily use the internal carafe as I do each day to fill the storage tank but must be a little careful to avoid spillage.  I don't view filling up the tank as much of an issue or problem as other reviewers have mentioned.

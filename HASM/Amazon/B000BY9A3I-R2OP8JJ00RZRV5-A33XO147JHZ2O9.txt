Title: does't work
Content:
I received this vac in 5 days! However, the hand wand variable speed selection cuts out every few seconds. I took it to an authorized service center @ Hollywood Blvd. Vacuum center service. The owner ridiculed me for purchasing this Vac over the internet and told me to send it back. I then contacted the 800 # and they authorized to return it directly to Dirt Devil i.e.the power cord plug, which will do 03/15/2010. I hope this will be resolved soon.

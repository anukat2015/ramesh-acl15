Content:
I received this as a Christmas gift and I have tried my best to make a decent cup of coffee out of this thing.  I have tried different brands of coffee, different sweetner, cream, more cream, less cream, any combination - you name it, I've tried it and it always comes out the same: watery and bitter.  So, 7 months later I have finally called it quits.  I just ordered a Braun KF180-BLK FlavorSelect 12-Cup Coffeemaker through Amazon and I have my fingers crossed.  All I ask is for a decent cup of coffee in the morning!  Once this new machine comes in I'll rate it and give you my view...hopefully it's positive.

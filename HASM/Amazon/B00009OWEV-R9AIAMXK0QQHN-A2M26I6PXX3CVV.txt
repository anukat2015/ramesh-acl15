Title: Very Good Coffee Maker   BUT  At What Price ?
Content:
I only have a few vices left. I love good coffee, good cigars, and wonderful chocolate. And I don't mind spending money on a good product. The Eva Solo Cafe Solo Coffee Maker is just that. A cleverly designed Coffee Maker that works well. Basically, Eva consists of a decanter, its cozy little sweater, a filter with cap, and a stirrer. It is easy to use although a bit more time consuming than say my Stove Top Espresso. The resulting coffee is very good. As good as my French Press. As good as my Stove Top Espresso Maker. It is nice having it in my arsenal of coffee makers, although that cute little sweater does not really keep the coffee warm for long. My real problem with this product is the price. At around $80 including shipping, this well designed product costs at least 2 if not 3 times what it should. Paying somewhere between $27 and $35 would seem appropriate to me. Good Coffee Maker. Bad Price. (My review is of the small .6 litre Eva)

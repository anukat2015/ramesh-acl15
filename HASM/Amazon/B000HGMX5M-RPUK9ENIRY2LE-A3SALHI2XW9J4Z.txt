Title: Not Great
Content:
I researched the D80 for a year before I bought it.  I ended up getting the D80 with the 18-135 lens.  Then I bought the 10-20mm Sigma lens; and next I bought the 50-300mm Sigma Macro lens.  Every review basically said it was amazing.  Well, I have never been more disappointed!  This camera is NOT worth what it costs.  To date I've spent well over $2,000 and it simply can not compare to my 40 year old Konica film SLR.
Good points:  screen size; start up speed; ability to take numerous pictures in a row very quickly; easy menu & good editing programs.
Bad points:  18-135mm lens is obviously cheap and takes very poor pictures (unless you're just going quick indoor shots - then it's okay); the pop-up flash is weak - very, very weak; the printed picture quality is abysmal - always looks flat; the manual settings do not work like a normal SLR - the light meter is off and I need to always go darker or the pictures are very white
I have been using film SLR's for many, many years but as good film is harder & harder to find, I "upgraded" to the D80.  I have no confidence in it however, and am now going back to shooting with my film SLR (using slide film) as a backup to the D80.
I do not recommend this camera.  Buy a point & shoot digital instead - the picture quality can't be any worse.  This is not a good investment.

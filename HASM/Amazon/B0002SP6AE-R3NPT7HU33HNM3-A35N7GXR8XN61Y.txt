Title: Worked for a week
Content:
This product was great for a week but hasn't worked since.  The thermostat won't cool the house anymore. I even had the A/C guys out here twice b/c I thought my A/C unit was broken. It's not. I'll set the temp. at 75 degrees and the temp. in the house will read 83! It'll maybe cool the house to 80. It's never cool in our house anymore. Also, the display doesn't light up. I can't recommend this product at all. Buy something else!

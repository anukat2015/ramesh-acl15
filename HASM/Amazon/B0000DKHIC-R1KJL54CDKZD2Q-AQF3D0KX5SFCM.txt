Title: Got it in Fall 2004
Content:
Though my room is only 9'X13', my main steam heat doesn't work at full capacity & in winter my room can be honestly 50º.
Except 1-2x of it not shutting off when it reached the set temp. after being on constantly for days in the past 2 winters, it has worked well. It would just get hot in the room, the plastic unit itself never got hot. When it was below 0º at night it didn't get the room up to 72º which I like, other then that, it's been great, not whisper quiet, but not too loud either. 
Heats up the room in 10 min from 55º to 70º. 
3/2007 - still working, it shuts off itself once in a while due to overheating because I'm having problems cleaning the 3 years of dust off the grill in the back. I'm not sure how to get in between the deep & wide plastic housing that only has less then a pen thin slit opening to the metal grill to pick it out. The front grill never gets dusty. The remote is still going strong.
11/2007 - though the Honeywell still works fine, the remote as well, cleaning with scissors has been hard & still can't get off all the accumulated dust. I bought a Vornado heater which stays on all the time with fan only to keep hot air circulating & is whisper quiet & so far happier.

Title: What a Pain Vacuum Cleaner
Content:
Words can't begin to describe how much I hate this vacuum cleaner.  The cord is too short and needs unplugged/replugged 3-4 times for a large room.  The attachments are too small and fall off the back of the cannister often during normal use.  The attachments have to fit on the end of the collapsed main handle which is too long so you can't get close enough to do any decent cleaning.  The collapsible handle doesn't want to collapse easy and then it doesn't want to lock in place when extended to clean the floor or carpet.  Yes, it does suck up dirt and dog hair well, but it should since you have to empty it at least once (or sometimes twice) during a regular cleaning job with a dog.  The plastic dirt holder is hard to completely empty since the plastic holder has a magnetic affect on dust and dirt.  It is heavy, awkward to use, a nightmare for vacuuming steps and hard to get stored.  The hose doesn't swivel when you use it, then the main hose kinks in the same place closing off the air!  I tried to get used to this machine and I am completely fed up with it.  I am getting rid of this very, expensive overrated bad purchase I made.  I have ran out of more negative adjectives to properly describe this vacuum cleaner that was invented by a person who I doubt seriously has ever vacuumed a house, just devised the mechanics.

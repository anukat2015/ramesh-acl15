Title: Good for singles or couples
Content:
If you like an old-fashioned electric percolator for brewing coffee as I do and you are single or a couple who wants a cup or two of coffee at a time I would recommend this Farberware percolator.  I use a paper filter in the grounds basket but it is just my preference.  This percolator is fast and efficient and the coffee gets hot and stays hot.  The only drawback to my particular unit is that the lid is especially tight and not easily removed for cleaning but I am hoping over time that it will loosen a bit.  The price is reasonable.

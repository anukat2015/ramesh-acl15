Title: New iPod Shuffle
Content:
This is the 4th iPod shuffle we have purchased in our household. We bought this as a christmas gift for our daughter.   I am surprised it is an Apple product based on it's clumsy, poorly thought out design. The iPod ear buds don't work for my ears, so I have to use different headphones. Same for my children's ears as well. This is a problem due to the fact that this new design has the volume feature built into the head phone wiring. Why? It doesn't make any sense. Plus there is no forward or reverse function to skip or rewind a song. I recommend spending your sixty dollars more wisely and skip this purchase. This is the most disappointing product Apple has ever come out with.

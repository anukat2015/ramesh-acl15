Title: You'll Love This Camera
Content:
I am new to photography and had been wanting a digital camera for a long time, and bought my first one this summer. After months of research and comparison shopping, I decided on the D80. This camera was awesome right out of the box - I was taking amazing pictures the very first day I got it! It comes with a quick-start guide which shows you the basics, and by the time the battery charged (an hour and a half) I was off & running!
I don't know why I waited so long, I absolutely love this camera! Start-up is very fast, as is the autofocus, and continuous shooting is a blast! The buttons and menus are very user-friendly and intuitive. The pop-up flash makes pictures taken in bad lighting conditions look great, and the battery lasts an unbelievably long time. Everything I do looks amazingly clear & crisp.
I love the 18-135 lens that came with the camera, it allows me to capture close-ups, landscapes, or zoom in for intricate detail. Lately I've been experimenting with the different modes (portrait, sports, etc) and getting some awesome shots. I admit the owner's manual is a bit intimidating; it contains a lot of good information but is a little overwhelming for a newcomer like me! I've learned a lot in the last 6 months though, and feel I will 'grow into' the more advanced features. I guess I'm a little spoiled because for a first camera - Wow! I am taking professional-quality shots, I feel like a pro just owning this camera. It does all I'll ever need it to do. If you are shopping for a digital slr camera, treat yourself to the D80, it is worth every penny. 
I use Extreme III 2-Gig SD cards and highly recommend them also.

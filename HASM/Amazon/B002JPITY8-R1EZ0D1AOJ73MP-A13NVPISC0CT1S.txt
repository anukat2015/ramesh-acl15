Title: Best portable media player money can buy
Content:
I am a music junkie and tried lots of different portable music/video players in the last few years. All of them had pros and cons: Some had small storage, other low battery life, or bad audio quality. Almost all of them sucked at video playback.
I borrowed my friends Zune HD yesterday for half an hour, and I WAS BLOWN AWAY. The display quality is so good, I find myself staring at it for hours. Audio quality rocks, the presentation (artist info, images, zune store integration, ....), extra free games and other applications, all awesome. I ordered the 16GB version from Amazon yesterday, can't wait till it arrives!
Zune Pass is also a great service: UNLIMITED SONGS for a small fee per month, worth every penny. You also get to keep 10 songs, completely yours forever, for free!
The smart DJ feature suggests new songs to you based on the songs you like/listen. The best part is if you have Zune Pass subscription, it searches the whole Zune music library for you! Kind of like Pandora, but better!
Zune HD also has FREE games, which comes very handy during long flights.
BUY ZUNE HD NOW, THE BEST PORTABLE MEDIA PLAYER EVER, YOU WON'T REGRET!

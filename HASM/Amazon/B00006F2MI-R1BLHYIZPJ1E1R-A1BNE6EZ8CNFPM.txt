Title: Don't be fooled
Content:
This machine is a great disappointment.  The Grind & Brew concept is a design failure.  As stated in another review, this machine requires extensive cleaning of 5 or 6 parts much more frequently than other coffee makers.  The design flaw is that the grinder is filled with steam on every brewing, caking the grinds in every nook and cranny and requiring messy cleaning after every brew.

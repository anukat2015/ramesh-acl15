I can't really reccomend the big buddy for use if youneed more than just a couple of hours. I needed heat in my garage for a weekend project more than six hours to heat a °30 garage to a comfortable temprature. It Puts out about the same Btu's as my old kerosene heater so i bought it. I didn't even bother with the 1lb canisters because i needed more than three hours and throw aways tanks are expensive and i think ecologically a dumb idea so i got the filter and the hose and a 20lb refillable. the manual dosent state which side to hook it to so i just chose one. the big buddy has two ceramic tiles in the front on low and medium only one of these ignite the second tile only comes on on the high setting, at least thats how mine worked. Low and medium worked just fine but the high setting worked for about two minutes then both tiles started to flutter. i shut it down checked all my connections made sure the tank was open and tried again, Same thing never could get it to work on high. 
From some of these reviews i get the feeling i could have corrected the problem by getting another tank, and hose, and filter and hooking up both sides. but then i would have invested in two $15. hoses, two $35. tanks and two $9. filters in addition to the cost of the heater, plus the hoses have to be ran outside to the tanks because your not supposed to have the tanks inside the building meaning you have to keep a door or window open or drill holes in your walls to run the hoses.
no thanks, I took it all back.

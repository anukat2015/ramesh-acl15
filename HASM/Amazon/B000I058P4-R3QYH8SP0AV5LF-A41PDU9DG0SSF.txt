Title: This klutz in the kitchen is sold on this thermal carafe
Content:
After breaking a carafe on our last machine, and discovering that buying a replacement would cost close to the same as buying a new coffee maker, I decided to take a chance on a thermal carafe (we've broken a number of glass carafes). We've had good luck on black and decker products in the past, so we decided to try out this product. It took me a little bit to figure out how use it, but once I understood it's been super easy.  Unlike our last coffee maker, this one's programmable features actually work.  And the coffee stays hot for at least 6 hours because of the carafe.  I drink at least a cup in the afternoon, and I do have to nuke that, but with the machines that have hot plates, I either had to heat it up the pot (it had automatic turn off) or nuke it anyway.  Often the coffee was burnt despite the automatic turn off feature.  I was a little taken aback when I first picked up the thermal carafe and it was barely warm.  But the coffee that came out was the perfect hot temperature.  All in all, I'm sold on this machine, and thermal carafes.  I won't be going back to the glass carafes.

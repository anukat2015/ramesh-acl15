Title: Seems Chintzy
Content:
Runs like a graped ape. Not real sure of the SD slot. Got my files to download but module didn't seem to seat too well. AC plug protudes from the right side, contrary to my living arrangement. Why dont they come up with a flush a/c plug. I've had to replace 2 for my Dell. Love the display. My pix look real good. Sound is ok, but it's never loud enough for me, anyway.

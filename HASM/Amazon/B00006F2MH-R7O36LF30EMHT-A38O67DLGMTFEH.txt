Title: Smooth
Content:
I have had great luck with this machine. First, it makes an excellent cup of coffee. It takes a few days to get the bean-to-water ratio just right, but once you do, it's smooth sailing. My wife and I like our coffee so strong it could melt steal and I was worried based on some of the other reviews the coffee would be too weak. Not so. I find it a lot smoother, which took some getting used to. I think the smoothness could be mistaken as 'weak' tasting coffee. Second, cleaning is pretty easy. I have no grounds left in the grinder and I clean it by rinsing it with the sink hose. The same goes for the gold filter. It literally takes me 5 minutes to clean it and get it ready for the next morning. Some reviews state that the parts don't quite fit after running them through the diswahser. However, the parts have 'not for use in dishwasher' stamped on them, so use the sink! Third, I love the sound of the grinder going off in the a.m., it's a great way to wake up! In summary, I love this machine. It is super easy to use, a snap to clean, and makes a smooth, smooth, cup of joe. One of the best kitchen buys we've made!

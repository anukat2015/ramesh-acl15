Title: Apple MacBook the BEST!
Content:
We grew up on Macs, I was a computer teacher and used Macs for years, had no choice but to switch to PCs for business-related applications. Now my son is almost 21 and in college and when his Toshiba laptop got stolen, he insisted on returning to a Mac. I saw him yesterday and he claimed, without question, that he will NEVER EVER use anything but a Mac again. I may just make the switch back someday myself!

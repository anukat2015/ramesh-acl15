Title: Great Purchase
Content:
My friend bought a Dyson a couple of years ago, so I borrowed it. I was very impressed by how much dirt it got out of the carpeting that I had just vaccumed with my regular hoover. WELL, this little canister does just as good of a job as the expensive Dyson for 1/2 the price! It is light weight, has great suction, and the hand controls make it so easy to use.

Title: Best you can get
Content:
Let me start off by saying that I have owned or used many mp3 players. Iriver h120, h320, rca lyra, ipod(not the color one), Creative zen xtra, the new samsung, and many more. The only mp3 player that beats this one is the h120, and you can't buy that one anymore. No software is needed at all. plug it into your cpu, go to my computer, and drag and drop. it took 35 minutes for me to transfer 3200 songs. has fm, fm recorder, and timer for the fm recorder. Nice if you would like to record a morning show or something while your at work. Turns on instantly, great sound quality, easy navigation. People say the albums are not in order, rename your files via musicmatch or what ever and have the track number first. this will solve that problem. You can search for your music or files with the browser function. Very nice if you like a more computer type of navigation. This is currently the best mp3 player on the market, I've only metioned a few features of this player. If your into electronics, this is the player to get. If your more about being cool and don't mind software that controls your music then I would suggest an ipod. In my eyes this player has the ipod beat in every area, with the exception of acceseries. Not to bash the ipod of coursel. Even I'll admit that the ipod is pretty cool and if it wasn't for all of it's restrictions, I would buy one, if there was no iriver of course.

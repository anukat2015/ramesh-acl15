Title: Excellent Laptop-Very Mobile-Terrific
Content:
This is the best machine I have used so far. Excellent piece I would say. Good bang for the buck.  
However CD/DVD ROM Does not not come with it. I guess that made it even more mobile. 
ASUS is going to beat the major players in this offering. 
Amazon is a great company made life easier by allowing people to provide reviews. This review concept definitely supports the going Green wave.

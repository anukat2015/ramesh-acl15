Title: Couldn't be Happier~Great ipod
Content:
I got my first ipod when the 3rd gen Nano came out and proceeded to fill it up right away. Now what? 
This 80GB was the perfect answer. I do not know how people can say 1-3 ratings. Mine is wonderful. I have 4,500 songs on it every CD I own. now I am converting my Records to CD and putting them on it too, I have 200++ albums and it will still not come close to filling this baby.
I got the square ipod home Amazon had as a deal of the day. It sounds fantastic...just like Bose. I crank that baby up and hear it all thru the house. I love that I can have all my CD's in one tiny place and take it with me.
I highly recommed this ipod. It is bult sturdy too.
My only sligt complaint is that many of my albums do not have artwork available in the itune store. I guess my type music is the most popluar. Christian Contempory.

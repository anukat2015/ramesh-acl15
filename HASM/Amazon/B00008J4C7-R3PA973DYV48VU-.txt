Title: clean filter=great suction
Content:
Wow, I love this little vacuum. My house is 1800 sq. ft. of wood floors w/ the occasional rug. This is why after much research I chose a canister vac. I completely agree w/ the prev. reviewer who suggested to the people w/ bad experiences, like 5 minutes till overheat, PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURERS DIRECTIONS!!! I have had this vac for 4 months now and it still has the suction it did the day I bought it. My secret? I READ AND FOLLOWED THE MANUFACTURERS DIRECTIONS!I tap out the filter w/ every emptying and rinse the filter occasionally(letting it dry for at least 24 hrs before reinstalling and using the vac). It really angers me that the people who can't read directions are trying to butcher this companys reputation. I have found that anything I own needs some sort of maintenance, anyone who does'nt realize that will end up with piles of useless things  that no longer work.

Title: Drastic Improvement Over My Last Vac
Content:
I bought this vacuum to replace another bagless canister that died after about a year of use (Fantom/EuroPro Falcon--the machine was poorly engineered, and the company's customer service was a joke).  This WindTunnel cost me maybe $50 more than the one I had before, but the features, convenience, and cleaning power more than make up the difference.  The adjustable suction is decent even at the lowest setting, and is almost too powerful at the highest setting (especially when the filter is clean).  I also love the 15-inch powerhead; those extra 3 inches of width really cut down on the number of passes needed to clean my carpets.  The fact that I can go from carpet to floor by pressing a button on the handle is a big improvement; my previous vac had a separate head for floors.  Switching between the powerhead to the smaller attachments is literally a snap, and all work well.  My favorite attachment is the mini-powerhead.  It cleans my carpeted stairs as thoroughly as the big powerhead cleans the main carpet, and it's great for getting into tight spaces between furniture where the main powerhead can't fit. 
My only gripes -- and they are minor -- are that the wheels of the powerhead can be squeaky, and if the cord isn't in a relatively straight line when I press the retractor button, sometimes it will stop before it fully retracts, and I have to pull it out about a foot and try again.
Overall, it's a great multipurpose machine, and I definitely think it's a good buy.

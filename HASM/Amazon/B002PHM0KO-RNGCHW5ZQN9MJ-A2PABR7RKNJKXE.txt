Title: Sony has been a bitter experience
Content:
After a couple of months of use, the laptop keeps switching off randomly after using it for 10 to 15 minutes. I see on the internet that many other Sony laptops have the same issue, but no one can figure out how to fix it. Not even Sony tech support staff!
So far, my Sony laptop has been a big disappointment!

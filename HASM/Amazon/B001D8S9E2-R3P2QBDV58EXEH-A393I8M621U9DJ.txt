Title: Almost perferct!
Content:
This new mac is wonderful.
It is lighter than my previous model (late 2007) and the glass over the screen provides a very nice  protection to the display, making it much easier to clean!
The only downside I found was the lack of keyboard backlight on the 2.0ghz model as the black keyboard is very hard to see in the dark.
If you need to see the keyboard to type, or if you have the option, get the 2.4ghz one.

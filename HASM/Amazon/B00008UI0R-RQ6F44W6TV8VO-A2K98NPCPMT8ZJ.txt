Title: miss my old one
Content:
My husband talked me into this one after painters damaged our Kenmore Progressive.  While this one is seemingly lighter and easier to move around with, I'm not sure it's better than our previous vac.  I saved a few on-board attachments from the old vac (the horsehair nozzel and the long nosed crevice nozzel) because the Hoover didn't have them.  It has two small on-board attachments that I find completely useless.  The other attachments have to be stored elsewhere, so you have to carry them around with you as you vac.  Aside from the stair nozzle, I didn't have to do that with the old vac - it carried everything for me.  The other issue is the bagless feature.  I'm constantly emptying the container.  Vac one room and you have to empty it.  When you do - dust gets everywhere and effects your sinuses for a couple hours afterward and I don't have allergies or sinus issues.  I have to take the trash can out on the deck to empty the container and try not to breathe while I do it.  The filter is fun to clean too.  I miss the Kenmore Progressive.  A little heavier and it had a bag - but I think it was overall better.

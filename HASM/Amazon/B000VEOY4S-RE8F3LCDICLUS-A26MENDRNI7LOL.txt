Title: Heavy, awkward with very little suction!
Content:
I bought this vacuum because it was the only one I could find that is bagless, has a retractable cord, and a telescopic wand.  The suction is just barely there when ANY of the attachments are on.  I have to take the attachments off to get corners clean.  Forget about pet hair, it wont handle it!  The attachments don't snap onto the vacuum, with the exception of a clip that goes onto the hose that gets in the way.  So none of the attachments you need are ever around when you need to switch them.  Carpet attachment wont even work on my short pile persian rug, and wont roll easily.  The beater bar stops the second you put in on the floor.  It is quite large and heavy to move around.  I should have sent this back!

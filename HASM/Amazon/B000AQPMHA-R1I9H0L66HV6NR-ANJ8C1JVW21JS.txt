Title: Cheaper than a fancy espresso machine
Content:
Pros:  Brews a perfect single cup of coffee each time, better than instant or those coffee bags, wide variety of k-cups, optional filter availible so you can use your own coffee instead of k-cups, Tea k-cups also availible.
Cons:  Only makes one size (7.5 oz) cup, (Go for the B-50 B-60 for more size choices, but also more cost), k-cups can be pricey because they come from smaller companies like Green Mountain (They can be had 18 for about 10 bucks at the store with the bullyseye logo.)

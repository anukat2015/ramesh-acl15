Title: Forget the netbooks!
Content:
If you are considering buying a netbook for a travel computer take a look at this one instead. It is a full feature laptop ( 1.3mhz Centrino 2 chip...) no bigger than a legal pad. The only thing it lacks is an internal DVD drive, but there are dozens of external USB powered DVD drives available (i.e. HP 556s ...) to take along if you need one. I got my 1810T from Tiger Direct, they have them in stock at their local retail outlets. The screen on this 1810T is sharp. It comes complete with Windows 7 Premium (x64) and 4gb of DDR2 ram. The hard drive is a big 320gb size but only 5400 RPM. A 7200 RPM drive might make it a little faster but since it's not a gaming computer it doesn't really matter. When the prices come down on large SSD drives that would be a better option. The battery life is indeed long but to get near the 8 hour life they advertise you need to turn off the Wi-Fi. Otherwise you'll see about 5 hours of battery life. The laptop cover is shiney and smooth texture which means finger prints will show easily. Overall I'm very satisfied with this little laptop, and it's perfect to throw in my suitcase for travel. It beats the netbooks hands down.

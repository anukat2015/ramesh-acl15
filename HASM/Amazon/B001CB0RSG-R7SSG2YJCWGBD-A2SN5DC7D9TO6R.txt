Title: Very sleek MP3
Content:
I am quiet pleased with the zen x-fi! I really enjoy the built in FM radio which many MP3's lack including the Ipod. Also there is a built in DJ feature which pre-sorts a mixture of songs of your choosing, for example it will pick out all the top rated songs in your library, the songs you listen to the most or the least, or a one hour random play list. I use this feature a lot, It saves me time from having to sort through and find a band i want to listen to only to change my mind a few minutes later. Another thing that really sold it for me was the SD compatibility. This is especially nifty for videos and pictures or expanding your units memory for more music cheaply. The buttons are a little on the small side, but with some practice they are clear enough to flip through songs without looking, and you won't have to dig the unit out of your pocket to skip a song, something that is impossible with the touchscreens, and wheel based navigation buttons. Overall the zen x-fi is a tremendous bang for the buck. I do however recommend picking up a silicone case and screen protector, because it shows hand grime easily (as with most hand held electronics).

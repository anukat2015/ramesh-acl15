Title: short changed
Content:
Bought a B70 from bed, bath and beyond in sept 2009.  we make about 1-2 cups a day.It works great except every 10-12 cups, the volume is 4 oz. insteade of the 7 oz. the maker is set to.  the next cup is then the right volume.  I called keurig and did the requested descaling ( about 4 times in 9 months), and the paper clip cleaning.  still short volume.  they are sending a replacement (hopefully not refurbished).  reading all the comments, i will hang onto the old one just incase the new one is a lemon.  will update once we receive the new maker.

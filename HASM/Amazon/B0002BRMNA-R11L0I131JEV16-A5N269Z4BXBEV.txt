Title: Warranty Issues
Content:
The unit failed after 2 hours.  Because it was a gift and I did not have a receipt, I called Creative to ask if it were under warranty.  I didn't want to ship it back to have them simply charge me.  They assured me it was under warranty.  But, after shipping it back, Creative refused to repair it or even send it back without substantial payment.  So, if you are going to give it as a gift or receive one, try to maintain the receipt.  The warranty is only 90 days (which says something about the quality of the product).

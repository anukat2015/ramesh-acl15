Title: Silent, silent, silent!  And it heats the room...
Content:
Pluses:
** It's virtually silent, save for a barely audible click it makes when the heating element turns on/off.  And mind you I have supersonic hearing, so most people probably won't even hear it.
** Digital thermostat makes it easy to maintain the desired room temperature.
Minuses:
** My biggest gripe - no remote control.  You have to bend down on the floor to reach the buttons and read the display.
** No backlight in LCD, which would be nice at night.
** Small yellow/orange power indicator lights up the room a bit, but can easily be covered with electrical tape or whatever.
** Grill gets hot, so probably not good for toddlers or stupid pets (my dog knows better).
** It's reasonably large, measuring 40-odd inches in width.  I actually found the measurements beforehand on some random website, so I knew about its size.  But if you have size constraints you may have issues.
I know it sounds like I have more negative things to say than positive; I guess I'm just critical.  I think it's an excellent heater if you don't mind some of the negative aspects, which I think are more or less personal preference.  In closing, I'd give it a 5 if it came with a remote.

Title: The camera placement... and other things
Content:
I got a red ipod nano 16gb directly from apple, it looks really nice, and feels nice too. The speakers were a great add. The youtube videos I downloaded viewed on the screen were nice quality.
(My last ipod was a 1st gen)
The videos you take are downloaded as ".mp4" and ".dat" (both for each video) (can't upload onto amazon, but you can upload onto youtube) I thought that you would be able to get the videos out using itunes, but I was mistaken. The way you get to them with the XP PC, is that when you plug in, you open up the files using windows explorer (when the option comes up), or you do this:
Start>My Computer>ipod(K:)>DCIM>000APPLE
The games on it, solitaire, a maze game, and a vortex game.
You can add and delete things from the main menu, which I found convenient. The video quality was okay, and same with the speakers.
All in all, the product is very nice.
I would have probably given the ipod nano 5th gen 5 stars if:
1. The camera was placed in a much more convenient spot.
2. Along with being able to take a video, being able to take a photo.

Title: The Worst Vacuum I've Ever Had
Content:
Within a few months of my purchase, I realized I hated this vacuum.  I kept thinking that maybe I was using it wrong.  Maybe I had it set incorrectly for the application.  I even called Bissell.  After checking everything, it was determined that the machine was working properly, NOT! I have hardwood floors and a wool area rug.  I also have 2 cats and 2 dogs (the whole reason for this purchase). To confirm that a vacuum is working, I always vacuum barefoot.  If the vacuum is not working, my feet know it.  This one was kicking back so much debris, I was endlessly vacuuming the same spot while picking up absolutely nothing, even though it was on the bare floor setting.  So maybe this is a carpet vacuum, NOT. My dark blue whole rug would not give up any pet hair to this vacuum.  I should have taken it back, I should have taken it to a repair center but in the end, it's going to the dump.  My two years of cursing a vacuum are over.  I should have gotten the Dyson like I had originally wanted.

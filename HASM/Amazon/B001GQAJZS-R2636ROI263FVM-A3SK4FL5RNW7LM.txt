Title: A profoundly bastardized keyboard
Content:
It has been now eight months of my suffering. While not everything is bad I am giving it one star based solely on the qualities of its keyboard. I wish I could give zero. 
1. Who came up with a dumb idea to leave out the function key row? Leave F11 and F12 withoug any equivalent?
2. Who shuffled enter and shift?
3. Who switched several other keys around?
Incredible. The total mess stands out if you happen to be unfortunate enough and need to switch between different languages and/or touch type. Some characters are even not possible. 
Yeeh. Have the wireless keyboard. BUT Will YOU carry the hog around? On a plane? To a library? 
I am SOOO unhappy with this netbook I am giving it one star. I wish I could give zero. No...the time did not resolve my suffering. I should have got rid of this succker loong ago. 
yes...you can connect the external keyboard and external lcd and then you CAN get buy. But using this netbook as a netbook ... SUCKS.

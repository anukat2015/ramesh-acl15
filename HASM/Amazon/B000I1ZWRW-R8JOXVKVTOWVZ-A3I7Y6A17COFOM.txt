Title: PERFECTION
Content:
I have owned this camera since the beginning of the summer, and have had no trouble what so ever. It takes amazing photographs, and is worth the money, and the added size and weight. SLR cameras are much better than point and shoots, and with this camera you can feel like an expert.

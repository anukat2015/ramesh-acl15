Title: It is so good we have 2 of them.
Content:
This is a great Vacuum. I got one about 5 years ago and it still works great. My wife used it every day and the tube got weak out and broke. Since the vacuum it self still works very well and it is powerful, I now use it in the garage and got the exact same model for my wife.

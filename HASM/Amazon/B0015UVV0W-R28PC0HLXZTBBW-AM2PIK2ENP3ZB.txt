Title: Temperature Readout Problem
Content:
I bought this heater at the end of January, and the digital temperature readout stopped working in June. All that's left is a few lines instead of numbers. Since this heater is in my baby's room, I don't like leaving it on without knowing the temperature. My only other complaint up until now was that the light on the temperature readout was way too bright. It lit up the entire room. The heater has a 2 year warranty, so I will probably exchange it for the same model.

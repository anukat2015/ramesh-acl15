Title: Great features but nearly DOA
Content:
Bought it for a gift for Christmas (tomorrow but we did gifts today). Out of the box it had to charge a while before the computer would recognize it. She loaded her music fine and was using it for a bit and was working fine then when browsing the folders it locked up and shut off. It will not restart and I can't get it to restart. It has a built in li-polmer battery so you can't manually remove it to powercycle the unit. 
      I'll make sure it sits overnight or longer and if it'll boot up again after the battery dies and is recharged in the computer I'll run the firmware program and hopefully it'll fix it but I doubt it from past experience. 
      I was going to buy one for myself as it's nicer than my really cheap no name aaa battery powered cheap looking Centon MP3 player but now I'll stick with my cheapie cause it actually works. I had hoped for b etter quality since it was a sandisk product but I guess not.

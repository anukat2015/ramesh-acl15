Title: Excellent heater, noticable difference
Content:
I am very happy with this heater.  It is silent, keeps the temperatures up, is safe, and hasn't destroyed my electric bill.
I bought the DeLonghi EW7707CM a little over a month ago.  The house I own is quite old and some places are poorly insulated.  The master bedroom is quite large and gets very cold in the winter.
This radiator made an immediate and quite noticeable difference.  Even on the lowest power setting my room went from cold to comfortable, and on higher settings and left for longer periods of time it can really make a space toasty.
I went for this model for several reasons.  It has 3 power settings, which is helpful for me because the fuses in this building don't hold up well to heavy loads.  On the highest setting I did blow a fuse, but I can run low and medium along with my computer and other electronics without any trouble.
In addition, I have cats and a dog running around and I didn't want something they could start a fire with.  A large animal running full into this heater might tip it as it is fairly light, but medium sized pets should have no trouble.  It is safe to touch for a few seconds, and you'll notice the heat well before you hurt yourself.
I was slightly nervous as some reviews mentioned that the heater can break and start leaking.  To be safe I have the heater standing inside a long pan to collect any oil that might seep out.  So far I have had no leaking at all.

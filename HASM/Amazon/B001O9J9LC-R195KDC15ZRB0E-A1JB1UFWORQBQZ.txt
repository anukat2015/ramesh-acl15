Title: Good desktop replacement
Content:
This laptop feels every bit of the 6.7lbs that Sony states that it weighs.  However, it is a nice alternative to sitting at a desk or even watching the occassional Blu-Ray movie.  The screen is nice and crisp, but blacks tend to look more like a charcoal color.  The keyboard is great and touchpad has a good feel.  The mouse buttons are a bit stiff and are somewhat loud compared to other Vaio laptops I've owned.  If you're planning to take it on the road, be sure to purchase the extended life battery.  The standard battery shipped with the FW lasts a little under 2hrs under normal operation.  Overall a good laptop, but not exactly 'portable'.

Title: NOT WORTH THE MONEY!
Content:
Here's the deal:
- It has the same output as the cheaper models
- The Heater uses a fan, so you will hear the fan, granted its not the loudest fan.. Additionally, at every interval when the thermostat kicks in, you hear a loud enough click. If you want a silent heater, buy a convection heater
- The most annoying aspect of this heater is the display at the top of it. It has an LCD style display in a pretty colorful blue which NEVER turns off. So in a dark room there is this nightlight effect. Totally annoying!
- Finally, the feature on this unit is EXTREMELY basic. Hi Fan low Fan aand aa digital reading of the room temperature. WOW! is it really worth twice as much as the other models? NO its not. Additionally the casing seems flimsy. Nothing to suggest a hi end unit.
In the end the heater isn't bad, just not worth $150 average when yoiu can get one for $70 average. Good Luck

Title: BATTERY LASTS FOREVER / BUFFER IS BIG / IMAGES LOOK GREAT
Content:
I traded up from a nikon d100 and its been great.   a little trouble at first.  a very expensive long lens i bought was out of adjustment and vinnetting.  it took me a little while to figure out and i sent it back.  they broke it down and re-installed the elements and its been fine ever since.  news photography - aerial photography - artwork.  no problems with extreme cold (15F soaked) , moisture, heat or heavy use.   with a 1.4 lens its almost like night vision.  stuff that i can barely see well enough to focus  comes out well lit and not blurred while handheld. BTW i don't recommend a nikon.

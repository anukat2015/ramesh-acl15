Title: Better in some ways than a D2X
Content:
This camera replaced my Nikon D2X and in some ways I like it better. The brighter viewfinder, the CCD sensor quality seems to be better than the CMOS sensor quality of the D2X. I miss the vertical grip and the heaviness of the D2X but for thousands less, it's a spectacular camera. I think it's also better constructed. I dropped the D2X on a carpeted floor from only a height of about 3 feet and it cost $500 to have repaired. The D200 was accidentally dropped in a similar manner and it was unscathed and is still working perfectly. Perhaps because it's a lighter camera. I can highly recommend this camera. I use it primarily for shooting houses for real estate agents and the tonal quality is much smoother than the D2X.

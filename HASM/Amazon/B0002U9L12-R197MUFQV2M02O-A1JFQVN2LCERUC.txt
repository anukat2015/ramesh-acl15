Title: Free Replacement for "Overheating Issue"
Content:
Length:: 1:19 MinsMy machine began to yield very little coffee for the amount of water I was using After calling Mr. Coffee, it turns out my machine was "overheating." They asked for my address and immediately sent a new unit in the mail. If your machine has begun to yield a small amount of coffee or is taking a very long time to brew, this may be your problem and I suggest you call them.

Title: Exceeded Expectations
Content:
This camera exceeded all my expectations. Purchased after reading several favorable reviews by respected authorities. I have owned professional 35 MM film cameras in the past (Nikon) and several digital cameras recently (Sony and Canon)but this camera just blows them away. Even taking "snap shot" pictures exceeds the capabilities of the 35 MM film cameras using the best techniques under the best conditions. I also found the menu and user interface to be both convenient and intuitive. Great camera for a great price!

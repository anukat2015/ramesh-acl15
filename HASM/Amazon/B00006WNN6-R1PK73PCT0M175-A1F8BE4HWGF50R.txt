Title: Would be great if it stayed on!
Content:
I received a $25 gift certificate, and with my cold office, decided to use it to buy this.  Since I didn't want to go over my certificate amount, I picked this heater because it was one of the cheapest.
I made sure to read all the reviews first, and a lot of them mentioned a problem with the heater turning off by itself when it *thinks* that it's reached the right temperature, but in fact it still feels cold and/or you want more heat.  However, there were a lot of great reviews for this thing, too, so I talked myself into it and convinced myself that maybe there was something wrong with those people's heaters or their settings.
Well, I should have listened to all those reviewers and myself!  One of the worst feelings ever is, once the heater gets going, and you're starting to feel all toasty and warm, IT TURNS OFF!  You're like "Nooooooooo! I was just enjoying myself!"   Yes, it's a "feature" they promote, about how it saves energy and is safer because it turns on and off depending on your temperature setting.  But the temperature it registers inside itself (right near its warm coils) is quite different from the temperature I'm feeling sitting only 2 feet away.  It's very annoying!  As I'm sitting here typing this, it won't turn on even though I have it on the highest setting because *it* thinks it's warm enough.  Well, I'd like to have a heater that works when *I* think it's warm enough.

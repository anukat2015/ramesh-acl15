Title: 5 Stars for the computer, No stars for the Battery!
Content:
Love the computer, hate the battery! I picked this computer up at Office Depot a week ago for an awesome price over what HP Direct is charging. I must say I am impressed with it thus far and I only hope to get the extended, bulky 12 cell battery upgrade soon. I do wish that the keyboard was backlit, but not that big of a deal.
At the rate laptop computers are growing one can only hope that a new tecnology for batteries can be developed.

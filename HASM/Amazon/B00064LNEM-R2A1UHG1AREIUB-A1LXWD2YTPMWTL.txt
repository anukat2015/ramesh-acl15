Title: Leak Proof Spout    NOOOTTTTT!!
Content:
On the handle of the coffee maker is a tag that says "Leak Proof Spout".  I should send a video to Youtube to show how non-leak proof this thing is.  Sent the first one back and got a second....guess what?  It leaks...now I call HB direct to see if they would send me just the carafe...so I could help the environment...they said yes but were going to charge me for the shipping...this product and company - A joke!!

Title: Very, very heavy to push around the carpet
Content:
This vacuum folds up nicely and is very compact - but that's probably the best thing about it!  It is extremely heavy to push around - even in just a straight line!  If you want to turn corners, get a wrist brace as too much vacuuming with this cleaner will leave you with sore wrists!  The bag doesn't last long either - it's annoying after just two or three vacuums to have to replace the whole bag every time.  Forget the stairs!  It's way to bulky and heavy to lift up the stairs.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.

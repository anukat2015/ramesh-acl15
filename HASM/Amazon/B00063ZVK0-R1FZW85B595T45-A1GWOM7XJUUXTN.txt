Title: Finally, A Great Little Heater!
Content:
We have a one bedroom apartment, and although lovely, it is SUPER drafty due to the giant windows.  It is also hard to keep warm since we have high 9 ft ceilings and most of the heat rises to the top.  I have been using an old heat dish which just heats that little direct area around it.. but the rest of the room stays frigid.  Finally I decided to look for a good space heater.  I decided on this one and am very pleased.  First of all, it shipped SUPER FAST.  I turned it on, it's so quiet I barely know it's on.  Then the digital controls allow you to pre-set your temperature.  The little heater does the rest.  I was skeptical at first since it's so small, but the air does circulate well and pretty soon the whole room is warm and comfortable.  I am so thrilled to have found this.  Hopefully it will last me a long time!

Title: Great camera at an accessible price
Content:
Having used the pocket Canon S110 for the past three years, and already owning a Canon EOS Elan 35 mm camera, I've long been a fan of Canon.  I'd held off on buying a digital SLR due mainly to price.  Finally, with the Digital Rebel XT, I could buy for less than $1,000 the quality that pros paid $7,000 for just a few years ago.
Likes:
- Size and feel: it's about as small as you're going to get for an SLR, yet it still feels good in your hands, with all controls pretty accessible.
- Speed: having spent three years cursing shutter lag on my point-n-shoot S110, it's amazing to be able to get off 2 or 3 frames per second.  You'll quickly find that you shoot 3-4x as many shots in a day, just because you can get them off quickly.
- Battery life - I purchased a second battery but have yet to have to use it.  I can shoot 200+ shots and the battery is still going strong.
- automatic modes (portrait, action, etc) with options to override focus mode
- Basic 18-55mm EF-S lens is a solid, well-performing lens
Dislikes:
No strong complaints overall.  It's taking me a little longer than I expected to learn all of the control options on the menu.  Also, in bright daylight, the menu's not that easy to see on the LCD.
All in all, the combination of high picture quality (equal to that of the 20D) and virtually no shutter lag makes this a fantastic entry level digital SLR.  The ability to change lenses, use filters and modify settings as you would in the 35mm world changes the whole realm of digital photography.  I have a feeling my 160 GB hard drive may not support me for long...

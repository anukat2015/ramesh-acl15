Title: Great Vacuum, even with lead.
Content:
This is a five star review for two reasons:
1)  This vacuum rocks.  It is quiet, sucks up everything in site, and the bags last a long time.  My wife and I have a labrador retriever and three bunnies in the house.  The fur can be unbearable at times.  This vacuum is the best I've ever seen at picking up dust and hair.  And, it does not blow dust particles back into the air like many other vacuums claiming to have HEPA filtration.  I put this on par with a Miele vacuum.  Awesome.
2) The lead comment in the power cord does not only apply to this vacuum.  Check a lot of the products in your home, and you will find that MOST have lead in the power cords.  Apparently, PVC products contain lead.  PVC is the coating on the exterior of power cords.  So, all those extension cords, computer cables, telephone cords, etc. contain lead.  Want to wash your hands now?  I do.  Don't let it deter you from purchasing this good product.

Title: pleased
Content:
No problem with folding over the filter at all. We have stainless appliances and the pot matches beautifully. We had numerous problems with our last Krups pot leaking all over the counter (both water and coffee) and this has been no problem whatsoever with this new pot. The coffee stays hot consistently also.

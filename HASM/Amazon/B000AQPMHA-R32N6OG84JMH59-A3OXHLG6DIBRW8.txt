Title: Great In Our Shop - Highly Recommended!
Content:
The Keurig B40 Single-Cup System was the perfect solution for our small candle shop where we wanted to make coffee\tea\coco available to our customers, but didn't want to keep a pot on to get stale all day long. This is so easy to use, just fill the water reservoir (we use distilled water), add one of the K-Cups (many types\flavors available), put a cup underneath it and press the brew button. Clean up is as easy as removing the empty K-Cup.
I recommend using Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Extra Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2) if you like some bite in your cup, but most people find the regular strength to be quite good. My kids also like the Coco and Teas.
This just works great and it has been very a convenient (if a little pricey) way to add a little something extra for our customers (and for ourselves).
Highly Recommended!

Title: It's an OK coffee maker
Content:
In terms of what it's used for I think it's good (not great). Some pros and cons:
Pros:
-It brews coffee really fast.
-Thermal carafe is an excellent. keeps warm for long time.
-Timer comes in very handy
Cons:
-I had to exchange due to leak in the carafe lid and even the exchaned one is leaking too (not as bad as first one though). it's an internal leak where water/coffee sips into the lid whereI can't get it out. this is the reason for 2star.
-Too tall. it barely fints under my kitchen cabinet (miner)
-puring the water is not as good as other coffee makers I've used before. there is no way to measure water amout you are pouring unless you use measuring cup.
Anyways, that's my review. if it was for lid leaking I would say it would get 3 stars but leaking lid is not acceptable, especially 2 in a row.

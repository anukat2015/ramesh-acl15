Title: Hard Drive failed after only 6 months
Content:
I gave this two stars instead of one only because up until the hard drive failed, it worked great. Then, bam, everything was gone. My last back up was a few months ago. I thought, oh, it's almost new, it couldn't crash yet. I had a Dell in 2001 for grad school. Worked well, now I do not recommend them at all. The customer service is terrible and what a POS to fail after only 6 months. I didn't know why people spent all the extra money on Mac, but if I could I would return this thing and head over to the Mac store right now, where I could talk to a real, live human!! I dread even using this again because unless I back up daily, I could lose important stuff again in who knows how long. Too bad Dell let their service and products go downhill!

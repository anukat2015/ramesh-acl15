Title: Great Vacuum with some minor issues
Content:
This is a great vacuum! I have not had a cleaner house since using this vacuum. I vacuumed with my old vacuum (a Kenmore) then I repeated with then new Hoover and I got more dirt/dust out of my rugs and even the hardwood floors than my old vacuum.
Now for my complaints...the powered vacuum head does not say in a locked position like the picture shows, you have to "balance" it in order for it to stay. The hose is too short...should be about 2 feet longer, for more effective vacuuming of items like walls and furniture.
Overall this is a great vacuum, Hoover thought of how your going to clean the filters/change/empty the canister, because this task could not be easier. 
I recommend this....

Title: Solid choice for a student; loud fan a drawback.
Content:
I received this Toshiba laptop from Amazon a few weeks ago.  I'm a law student and needed something dependable, with a great keyboard, easy media buttons (to ensure quick mutability while in library), and a wide screen. 
This is more of a desktop-replacement laptop given that it's large enough to be too bulky to carry around.  The screen clarity is awesome, and I don't have any problems with reflectiveness.
There is one main disappointment:  a couple times a minute the fan kicks in and makes a whirring sound for 2-3 seconds.  It is a bit annoying, but I am getting used to it.  
Another drawback: the screen can only be tilted backwards to just beyond a 90 degree angle from the keyboard.  This really limits my ability to adapt the screen angle depending on light conditions, or simply my own position according to chair height or desk level etc.  I've adapted by putting a notebook under the front of the keyboard such that the laptop tilts backward, giving me a better view of the screen.
Overall I'm satisfied:  I have a huge screen for studying and writing papers, the keyboard is a great design allowing for comfortable typing with responsive keys, and appropriately clicky buttons.  The touch pad is also excellent and discrete.
And the webcam is great.  Mum and dad are already skype-ing!
In the future I might go back to Dell (I had one for 4 years before this Toshiba), although pretty much with any brand you risk whirring fans depending on the model.

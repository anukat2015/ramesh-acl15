Title: Canon XTi- Perfect for the entry level enthusiast
Content:
Short and sweet... The Canon XTi is great for those who, like me, are looking to make the jump from point and shoot to DSLR.  It's not hard to figure out and produces absolutely amazing images.  I've had this buddy for about a month and have already taken thousands of pics and many of them are better than anything I'd ever thought I could personally capture.  Now all of that can't be attributed to the XTi, if nothing else it definitely has given this newbie some added confidence.  I've also had some pros look this thing over and they said it's definitely worth the price.  Definitely not pro gear, but more than enough for enthusiasts/hobbyist.

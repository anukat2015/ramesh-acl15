Title: Zunes are the Best
Content:
Yet I have not bought or recieved a Zune yet, I plan on getting one. I have used my friends, are it was awesome. The sceen was so much bigger which made it easier to watch movies or music videos. Yes, it has very few accessories, but come on it just came out. I have already found a case I want for it and everything. If you compare ipod and Zune prices, Zune is a much better choice. A 30G ipod costs about $300. A 30G Zune is about $250. Now which one would you choose? I have used an ipod before and it was much harder to control. Although it doesn't have everything  an ipod has, I still think it is a much better choice. Not very many people would choose a Zune since ipods are still very popular, but I would. I did alot of research on Zunes and ipods, and found that I would feel alot happier with a Zune.

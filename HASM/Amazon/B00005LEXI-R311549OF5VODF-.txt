Title: DO NOT confuse carbon dioxide with deadly carbon monoxide
Content:
Just to clarify what a previous reviewer stated, although both are common products of combustion, DO NOT confuse non-toxic carbon dioxide with deadly poisonous carbon monoxide.True, normal combustion of propane, or any fuel, creates combustion byproducts that consist of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor. The danger is, in enclosed spaces such as cottages, tents, recreational vehicles and campers, any of these devices (whether they run on propane, naphtha, kerosene...) can also quickly produce dangerous amounts of carbon monoxide when starved of oxygen.  That's why this heater features a low oxygen shutoff system that automatically shuts the heater off if the amount of oxygen in the air gets too low.  Still, you should always provide adequate ventilation when using in enclosed spaces.

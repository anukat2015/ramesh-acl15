Title: Superior to most camera bodies in this class
Content:
This is a very good body, it is very important to learn how to use it. I HIGHLY recommend this body as a DX (APS-C) platform, the only advise I can give you is to read the manual cover to cover. This camera has quite a few advanced shooting capabilities and it can take a little time to get used to all the features and where they are in the extensively deep menu system. I would say that the only downfall is the high ISO performance, although for an APS-C sensor it does very well it is still an APS-C sensor and thus has limitations at higher ISO.

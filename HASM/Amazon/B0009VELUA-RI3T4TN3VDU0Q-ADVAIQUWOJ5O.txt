Title: buyer beware
Content:
This coffee maker makes coffee that tastes good but buyer beware......My husband and I bought our first cuisinart dcc-2000 coffee on demand coffeemaker one year ago. We had it for one week when the handle that dispenses the coffee cracked apart. We took it back. It was replaced with a new model. We were happy with the new model for less than one year. The timer that allows the coffeemaker to make coffee automatically was the next thing to go. We wanted this coffeemaker enough to keep it. This morning, I woke up and it will not work at all. Buyer beware. It makes great tasting coffee, it solves some messy problems but it may not work for very long. Something that costs this much, should work for longer than one year.

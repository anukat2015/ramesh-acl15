Title: bad customer service
Content:
I loved the thermal carafe and had no problems with this unit until 1 year after purchase. It would quit and beep without making coffee. I called the company and they said they would send a new unit out free but I would have to send the old one back when I received the new one. They would waive the shipping on my return. 
I called November 3rd of 2009. It is now January 13, 2010 and I am still waiting. I called twice and they told me it was on back order. Today I called, and told them I was using our old crappy coffee maker still. I was polite, but kind of annoyed with the waiting. The customer service rep. talked to his supervisor. They said they had a limited number of units available, and they would pull one immediately and send it. We will see.

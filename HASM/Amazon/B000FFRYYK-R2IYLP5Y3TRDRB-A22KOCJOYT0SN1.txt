Title: Great alternative to a hotplate
Content:
This is actually an upgrade for me. We had a regular Bunn machine with the hotplate before this model. Yet I don't like coffee sitting on a hotplate for very long since to me it begins to make the coffee taste bad after awhile. So we purchased a large airpump thermas to transfer the coffee to after brewing. Yet after about a year of going through this exchange it became very old to say the least. So this model was our answer. I've had no problems whatsoever. One thing not to do is to overfill the pot with the water you'll be pouring into the coffee maker. Overfilling makes it difficult to pour the water in without it spilling. And pouring the water in slowly helps tremendously. I had my last Bunn for about a year before switching to this model. And the model before that I owned for about ten years. They are very reliable coffee makers. A bit pricy, but if you consider the cheap models last for a couple of years before you buy another one, it makes more sense to purchase a good one to begin with.

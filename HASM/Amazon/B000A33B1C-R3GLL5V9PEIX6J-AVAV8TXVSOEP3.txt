Title: Very nice heater
Content:
This heater is very nice. It heats well, the timer is a GREAT feature.  After reading some of the other reviews, I was worried about the smell.  But I ran it for a few hours on high in a ventilated space, and the smell was non-existent after that.  Not a concern at all.  The outside is definitely warm, but not burning hot.  My only "con" for this heater would be the lack of a digital thermostat.  It took a little time to regulate the heater so that it wasn't too hot.  Otherwise, we're very happy with it.

Title: Busy Coffee Maker
Content:
The product looks great and works fairly well.  If you plan to drink the coffee right away that's OK; otherwise be sure to pre-heat the carafe by filling it with hot water and letting it warm up for at least 10 minutes.  If you don't do that, the coffee gets cool.
The coffee maker is complicated to get ready.  First you lift the top.  Then you swing the hot-water arm out of the way.  Next you pull out the coffee basket and fit it with a #4 conical filter.  If you take the coffee basket out to fill it, be careful that it doesn't tip over and spill the coffee.  It's also a bit tricky to fill the coffee basket while it's in the machine.
After the coffee is in the machine, or before you put it in, you must fill the machine with water.  When those chores are done, be sure to swing the spout into position and close the lid.  Pour the hot water out of the carafe: you put it in to warm up, remember?  Then place the carafe under the bottom of the coffee basket and press "On".  The noise is similar to a takeoff in an F-18.  If you set the coffee machine at the right time, you won't need an alarm clock in the morning, but you will have cold coffee since you won't have warmed up the carafe.
     The coffee is good, thank God, after all that.

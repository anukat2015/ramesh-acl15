Title: GREAT ITEM
Content:
I bought this item because of the SUPER low price! I saved about $60. At first I was a little worried because the seller stated it had a small defect/scratch in it. Once I recieved the item I couldnt find anything wrong with it. Its works perfectily! This is the second one Ive owned (the other one still works my wife just wanted a black one). I would recommended it to anyone. It really does make a better cup of coffee than any other type Ive owned.

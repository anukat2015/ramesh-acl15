Title: The Bissell is not the Best!
Content:
We have three dogs so I really need a cleaner that can deal with all the pet hair.  I'm impressed with how well this machine cleans carpet but disappointed with the job it does on hardwood floors.  While it will get fur balls up with no problem, it leaves dirt and smaller debris.  It is heavy, awkward, and difficult to maneuver.  I was excited about the attachments to use on my furniture to get the pet hair off but now I'm a little worried that it may be slowly thinning the material out.  Also, I think the pet hair attachment should have been made so that you could easily open it to clean it instead of having to take the screws out. Overall, for the $119 I paid I shouldn't complain too much.  When I bought my Miele I spent over $400 and had the opposite situation . . . it didn't clean carpet very well and had a problem with odors, but it was smaller, lighter, and easier to maneuver.  It does a good job on bare floors though so I'm glad I kept it. I guess there is no moderately priced, perfect vacuum cleaner out there.

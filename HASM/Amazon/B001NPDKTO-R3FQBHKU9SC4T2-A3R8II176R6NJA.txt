Title: Desktop replacement
Content:
Note: You really need to understand just how big 18.4 is. It's barely a "lap"top. This could be a pro or a con, but seriously, it's huge. 
Pros: It's mostly all great so I'll keep the pro's brief. 
Great screen, full sized keyboard is amazing, audio is fantastic, enough muscle for a power user, great for movies.
Works really well with Vista, Win 7, and Linux
Cons:
Runs so unbelievably hot I've taken cold-packs to it as a precaution. Not exactly comfy on one's legs. 
Packaged with loads of bloaty garbage software out of the box. Comes with awful audio drivers/config software. Once removed the Windows drivers work perfectly.
The size cuts down on the selection of accessories. Bags, fans, ect...

Title: Nice Step Up
Content:
I recently purchased the 40D as a replacement for my Rebel XT.  The XT has worked great but eventually it broke down (after any warranty was up) and gave the dreaded Error_99.  But enough about that, the 40D.
For the purpose of the review all my comparisons will be the Rebel XT.  The first and most noticeable difference between the two is the weight and build quality.  The 40D has a metal construction which adds weight (not good for hiking) but also adds a great deal of confidence in is integrity.
The menu system is vastly better than the XT because of dual wheels, this allows one finger to control the page and the other to control the item selected on each page.
The other vast improvement is the way buttons are laid out.  That is, on the 40D everything you could possibly want is at your finger tips.  This means an increase in the potential shooting speed, but also is a steep learning curve as there are a lot of buttons.
Finally the lens, the 28-135 IS is great.  Image Stablization allows you to get pictures with a shutter speed of 1/10 that look like 1/80.  This means that shooting in low light without a flash or tripod is possible.  The magnification is not amazing, but allows for decent pictures of average size flowers.  Finally, as with all DSLR's that don't have a full sensor size, the 28 doesn't allows you to get back as wide as I'd like.  Other than that it a great lens, and a great camera.

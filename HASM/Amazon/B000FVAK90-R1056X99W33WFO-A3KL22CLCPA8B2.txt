Title: Very good heater for small rooms
Content:
Heater warm quickly. Oscillating feature is very good. The timer turns off the heater within a few minutes of the setting. Actual temperature setting is not real accurate but you learn to adjust to it. I don't like having to reset temperature each time unit is turned on, however, overall, this is a very good heater for small rooms.

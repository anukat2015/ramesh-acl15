Title: eek! the mouse is terrible!
Content:
love everything about this machine and all that came with it. except the mouse. developing carpal tunnel syndrome within hours, i now travel with a wireless usb mouse. it's awful. the button is stiff as hell, and the touch pad is dodgy. otherwise, i dig it. just plan to travel with accessory.

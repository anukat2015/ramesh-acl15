Title: Functional for reason I bought
Content:
I read the reviews on several different MP3 players before buying this one. I bought it to listen to Netlibrary books because of the ability to bookmark. As other reviewers have mentioned it does have problems locking up although I have noticed it mostly occurs when fast forwarding or rewinding for a long time. The headphones that come with it are not as good as I would have liked as they have foam covers which seem to fall off rather easily. The manual also doesn't explain very well how to access additional menus which can be accessed by holding down the back arrow key which brings up an additional function menu depending on the screen. The battery life is OK, the buttons are small and I have inadverently recorded things when tring to adjust the volume, but overall the functionality is fine for the reasons I purchased it.

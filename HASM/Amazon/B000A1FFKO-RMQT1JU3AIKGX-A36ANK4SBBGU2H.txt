Title: Disappointing, but what do you expect for the price?
Content:
We've used Proctor-Silex products in our home before and expected a product of slightly better quality.
This coffeemaker functions, but only on a very basic level.
The entire unit is light and flimsy-feeling (it moves every time you press one of the buttons on the front), and it's nearly impossible to load it with water without spilling the contents of the carafe.
The LCD clock is ridiculously small and virtually unviewable.  The LED lights in the switches are so tiny and dim that you can't readily discern whether or not the appliance is even on.
If the carafe seems smallish, that's because it is.  The "12-cup" claim is dubious, because Proctor-Silex is apparently now using a smaller cup size in making their measurements.  Our former machine would make enough coffee to fill our 11-ounce coffee mugs a total of six times.  This coffeemaker will fill four 11-ounce mugs, with perhaps a couple of quarter-cup servings left over.
I can't really fault Proctor-Silex for making this appliance -- they need machines at all price points, and it DOES make coffee.  But there are NO "bells and whistles," and the entire things just has a "cheap" feel about it.
We're already looking forward to replacing this model, and you can be assured that the next time we'll bite the bullet and spend a few dollars more to get something a bit better.

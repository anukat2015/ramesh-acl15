Title: Excellent player
Content:
This is an excellent player for those of you who dont like to use itunes. The hard drive went out on my first player, so i had to get a replacement, but the replacement works fine. The sound quality is better than my old ipod mini, the battery lasts longer than my ipod mini, and it plays wma. Also it works great with windows media player and my yahoo subscription, which is a big plus for me.

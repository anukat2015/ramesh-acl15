Title: Great iPod Alternative
Content:
I originally attempted to buy this through Best Buy's website, and selected in-store pickup. Due to the store's ineptitude, when I went to pick it up (after being told they had it) not only could they not find it they still charged me for it! I still have not gotten my money back after several weeks of arguing with their nonexistent "customer service" department.
So I bought it on Amazon, paid $20 less, got it in a week with free shipping, and I love it! I'm an Amazon customer for sure!
As for the Sansa e250, I'll second what most others have written. Affordable, mostly easy to use (and I can avoid iTunes), great display, great looks, and includes the FM radio that works better than I expected. Now I have the option to listen to a ball game or the news in addition to listening to my MP3s. Recording off of the radio is a really cool feature. Displaying album covers is cool, too. Having a user-replaceable rechargeable battery is also a plus over the iPod (Apple makes such a big deal about not having any screws outside... but this makes it impossible to replace the battery!). The expansion slot is also attractive to me since I like to have the option of buying more capacity in the future.
As for drawbacks, I'm the same as most. I wish I didn't need to charge via USB, and the dial feels cheap (but works fine) and interferes with easy button pushing.
If you're in the market for a flash-memory portable MP3 player, I highly recommend looking at the Sansa e series players. They seem to be a much better value and feature-packed product than the iPods, for sure.

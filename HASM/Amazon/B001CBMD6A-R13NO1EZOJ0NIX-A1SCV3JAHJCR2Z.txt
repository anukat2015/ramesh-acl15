Title: Best entry level DSLR
Content:
I am looking for a camera with the following attributes:
1) Great indoor photo image quality.
2) Great ability to focus moving kids
3) Fast capture
I tried several compact/prosumer cameras and none of them fulfill the need.  So, I decided to try on DSLR.  I compared Rebel XS, XSi and Nikon D60.
All 3 of them are really good and fulfill my needs.  I picked Rebel XS because:
1) In amazon, with Canon $100 rebate, a Canon Rebel XS + Canon 75-300mm is only $520.  Very attractive price.  Rebel XSi alone is $640.  I don't think as a beginner, the larger LCD, higher resolution, more focus points justify the cost difference.
2) Nikon D60 has similar pice as Rebel XS but it is made in Thailand.  Rebel XS and XSi are made in Japan.
So, I have used the camera to do the following which I can't do with a point-n-shoot before.
1) Indoor singing performance.  With Full auto mode, the pictures are clear and sharp.  The only issue is a lot of red eyes to fix even I turn on the red eye reduction lamp.
2) Indoor portrait.  The picture with no flash is super!  The direct flash is too strong.  I may need an external flash to help adjusting flash angle to make flash picture better.
3) Outdoor picture.  Most of the point-n-shoot cammeras can do very good picture already.  But with Rebel XS, the focus time and snap time are crazily fast.  I can do continuous snap and pick the best easily.
4) This camera gives me great photo in Full Auto most of the time.  You don't need to be an expert at all.  Just hold still and press.

Title: Good value with a ton of annoyances
Content:
Impressed by the product build of the T135-S1330, I ordered one for myself via Amazon Prime.  
Upon receiving my new laptop, I was impressed by the look and feel of this latest Satellite.  The problems ensued, however, when I tried to navigate with the Trackpad.  
As I am one to give the benefit of the doubt, this trackpad was the worst I have ever come across in my experience.  No matter how I modulated the trackpad/pointer settings, the results were still abysmal.  
After an hour of total frustration, I gave up and submitted a refund in returning the laptop back to Amazon.  
I'm sure I might have received a lemon but I'll be purchasing anything other than a Toshiba Satellite T135-S1330.

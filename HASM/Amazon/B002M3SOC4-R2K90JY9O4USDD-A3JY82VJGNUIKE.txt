Title: short battery life
Content:
The battery life stated for this product is 30 hours for music and six for videos.  Mine hasn't lasted through a day of casual sporadic use.  Considering all the technical improvements since the personal stereo was invented 30 years ago, the sound quality isn't all that good.  it's great to use for reading e-books, but the battery runs down really fast unless you set the screen brightness down to almost nothing.  It would great if someone made a solar recharging case for this kind of item.

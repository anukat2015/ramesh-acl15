Title: New to Krups
Content:
My wife and I are medical students and therefore avid coffee drinkers.  Having recently gotten married, we were looking for a coffee maker that would be perfect!  We thought we had found it in this Krups model.  Below I am going to share the Pros and Cons about this model in hopes that it will help others make a good decision.  Trust us, we realize how important coffee is in the morning and throughout the day!
Pros:  Good strong coffee, fast brewing time, coffee comes out hot, and the heating unit works very well at keeping the coffee hot.
Cons:  As some have mentioned the carafe drips almost every time it is poured (frustrating!).  Also, after pouring water into the back of the unit several times a bubble formed in the tube that measures the water level rendering it unusable (not a huge deal but annoying).  Finally, the back of the unit that one lifts to pour in the water now doesn't fit flush with the back.  I think it most likely bowed from the heat (again, annoying).
In summary, I like this coffee maker.  It really does make good coffee!  I have thoroughly enjoyed the important qualities of this coffee maker...namely hot, strong, good tasting coffee.  The few cons, though, make this a good coffee maker and not a great one.

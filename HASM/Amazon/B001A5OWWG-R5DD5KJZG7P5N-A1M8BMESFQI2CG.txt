Title: Buyer's Remorse? Not here!
Content:
After purchasing the great 8080, the not-so-good E-300, and the amazing E-510, I thought I had finally finished purchasing my last camera for a while. I was completely wrong. After walking into the Calumet store in Oakbrook, Illinois, I simply couldn't help myself. I picked up the camera, attached my venerable 11-22mm wide angle, and completely fell in love. The feel was perfect. The ergonomics and control layout was a step above the 510, and the magnesium body felt solid as a tank. I had honestly thought about stepping up to the Canon 5D, but couldn't bring myself to put this camera down. It now goes with me wherever I go. Plus, I will never have to worry about a dirty sensor. Nuff said.
I got a beautiful Leica/Panasonic 14-50mm lens from a guy on eBay, and that has become my lens of choice for most of my work. Although it is not weather-sealed like the 12-60mm, the price was right and the quality is outstanding. One thing I need to point out. This lens has image stabilization built in. I did a side-by side comparison with this system, and Olympus' own in-body stabilization. No comparison! The Oly system completely blows Leica's away. So much for "lens specific" IS systems being superior. I turn it off and keep it off. Bravo, Olympus! I see the other systems adopting your leadership in this regard.
Thanks for a great system!

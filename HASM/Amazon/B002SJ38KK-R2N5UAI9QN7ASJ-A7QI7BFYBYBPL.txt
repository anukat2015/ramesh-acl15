Title: I paid $399 for a computer that didn't turn on...
Content:
I had searched around for a net book with a decent speed and memory. I chose the Acer Aspire AS1410-2497 for 399 (amazon has raised the price for some reason) over the Gateway EC1433U with similar specs. I received the laptop and it looked great. I followed all the set up procedures but when I turned it on nothing happened. Blank screen and no hard drive activity. Apparently Amazon takes it on good faith from the distributer that the laptop functions correctly. I rated the product as a 2 because I was happy with the portability and size of the screen... nothing more obviously because the thing wouldn't turn on. Amazon couldn't replace it because it wasn't in stock at the time so I had to send it out to Acer for repairs. This was negotiated after 2 hours talking to customer service at both Amazon and Acer. Its been over a month since I first placed the order and I am still waiting for Acer to return the netbook. So not only did Amazon send me a laptop that didn't turn on but now they have jacked up the price another hundred bucks. Buyers beware.

Title: A little camera that can
Content:
I will assume if you're looking at buying this particular camera model, then:  a. You are looking at upgrading from a point-N-shoot. Or,  b. An intermediate to advanced photographer looking for a decent backup camera. Since I have owned this camera, I have been doing a lot of shooting with a friend of mine who happens to do photography for a living. My friend uses a Fujifilm S3 pro dSLR. Let me tell you, there isn't much difference in picture quality between the $700 d40x or $2,300 S3 pro when using the same lens. Both cameras are capable of producing almost identically amazing pictures. The main difference is when buying the d40x, you can get about the same quality photos for more than 3x cheaper than an average pro-level SLR camera. 
If there was one thing I would do over again, I would definitely buy the d40x as a camera body only. Not that the kit lens is bad, but it's rather limiting to your d40's potential.  Having the chance to use Nikon's 18-200mm VR lens has made me a real believer of how important a really good lens is for great photography. 
My only major gripes about the d40x is the lack of adjustment buttons and no aperture dial the higher end dSLR's have. It can be somewhat annoying having to go into the camera's menu screen to make simple adjustments. 
The PRO's for sure outweigh the few CON's this camera has. It's a great dSLR camera to start out with. The only real limitations of the d40x will be the skill level of the person behind it.

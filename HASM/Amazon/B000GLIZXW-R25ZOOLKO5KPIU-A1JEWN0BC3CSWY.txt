Title: A great unit in general
Content:
The flame does look very real.  This fireplace insert is a great product in general.  I took out 1 star for 2 minor reasons though:
1. The remote only switches on and off.  It can not control the heat setting.  So you still have to approach the unit for heat setting changes.  One good thing is that the remote is wireless (433MHz).  So you don't need line-of-sight between remote and the power switch for it to work.  Hiding the power cord is much easier with the wireless remote.
    
2. Although the fire looks real, it may not be as bright as real fire.  I guess fake fire may just have its limitation.
    
Despite of these minor concerns, the unit is pretty well designed.  One great advantage is that you get to use the fireplace all year long - even
in the hottest day.

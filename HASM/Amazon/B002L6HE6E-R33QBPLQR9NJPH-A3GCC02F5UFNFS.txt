Title: Great Ipod & great price
Content:
I purchased this Ipod Nano for my daughter for Christmas,she was so excited and loved the look, the color and I loved the price.  I had been shopping around to find the cheapest price and purchased the product at another store but then found it cheaper on Amazon and returned the prior purchased and repurchased it.  Great value for the money, I would recommend this product to everyone.  It was so easy to set up and download muscic, plus it has video and a radio buit in.

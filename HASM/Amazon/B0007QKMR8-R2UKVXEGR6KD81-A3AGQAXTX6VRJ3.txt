Content:
- As one of my X'mas Gift's, my GF purchased the Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Black 'body'.
Some of you might have come across some of my other product Reviews and might recall that I use exclusively Canon & Nikon Digital & 35mm cameras.
I still own several 35mm models from each manufacturer, and have some very
expensive lenses that were in storage. This is one of the main reasons my GF, bought this particular Rebel XT model, so I can continue to use some of my extra lenses. And just to throw some info into the mix, is that this model has a plastic body, which is the reason, it's so light & small.
I would Highly-Recommend this Rebel XT perhaps as a great option for those people that would like to 'Transition-Up' from the typical 'point-n-shoot' consumer cameras, and more towards the ~ 'Pro-sumer' Level. By establishing a new 'Learning Curve' on this one, will Pay you back great Dividends, when you make your way up to the Mark III, which is one of the top-of-the-line Canon Digital SLR's, period!
I'm not going to list every possible Pro & Con issue with the Rebel XT, as some of the other Reviewers, have already done a magnificent job.
What I will repeat here is that my GF (and the past ones), all know that
I have always attempted to Select only those Product Lines that have been defined by their High-Quality & Features, & have been Rated near the top of the curve, and are also Unique or have an interesting Style. BTW, I also received the Canon 2400 Gadget bag (read all my reviews).
The only other add-on item that I would recommend for this camera is the
BG-E3 Battery Grip. You won't be disappointed!

Title: Exceeded Expectations
Content:
Placed my order on a Monday evening, arrived same week on Wednesday, very impressed with delivery time. The heater is well constructed out of metal and very sturdy, I simply unpacked it and pluged it in, I live in a two bedroom apartment does an excellent job of heating the entire living  and kitchen area and the hallway leading to the bedrooms, recommended it highly to other tennants do plan on purchasing two more.

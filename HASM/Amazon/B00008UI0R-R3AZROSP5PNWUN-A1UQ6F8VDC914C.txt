Title: I love it!
Content:
The Hoover S3765-040 Wind Tunnel is a great vacuum cleaner.  It does an incredible job of picking up dirt from deep in my carpet.  When I first switched to the Hoover, I was amazed at the amount of dirt that my old vacuum had not picked up.  My first pass with the Hoover filled the canister.  Attachments are easy to use.  There is no need to bend over to change attachments.  Everything can be done from the standing position.  It is small, compact, and easy to store away.  I higher recommend this vacuum.

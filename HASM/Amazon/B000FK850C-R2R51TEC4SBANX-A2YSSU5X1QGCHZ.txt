Title: Safe and Comfortable Heat
Content:
I own a SPT ceramic heater/humidifier and decided to buy another to supplement. (This unit does not include a humidifier feature) This unit has been working great.  As others have reported, the ion feature may just be a gimmick...I had owned an ion air purifier before, and it really changes the 'smell' of your air, and I don't detect that change with this unit.  That would be my only 'complaint."  I have read the negative reviews, and because of them I bought a CE extended warranty, so if anything goes wrong with this unit in the next 3 years I should be covered (the unit comes with a 1 year warranty.)  I plan to use this unit year-round because it can function as just a fan during warm months.

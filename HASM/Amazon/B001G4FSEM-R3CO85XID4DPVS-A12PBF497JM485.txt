Title: Pelonis ceramic disc furnace heater HC-451
Content:
Very disappointed!  The control knob for powering on/off/fan/heat broke after only a 7 weeks of use.  Poor Pelonis customer service that do not respond to emails.  Shipped the item back to Pelonis (about $10 USPS), and a replacement was shipped back, very poorly packaged--actually no packaging, just the flimsy cardboard box the heater comes in.
I bought this heater because I have an original Pelonis Disc furnace that is about 20 years old... not heavily used, but always worked great.  My wife wanted a heater to keep her outdoor cats warm in the attached garage during the real cold periods of winter.  So I looked for another Pelonis disc furnace as I wanted to still use my original in the basement, and the newer models seem to have additional 'safety' features.
While getting this one replaced, I purchased a HeatSafe HS-4025 ceramic heater that I like much better as it has a lower 1000W setting as well as the 1500 Watt setting.  The Pelonis HC-451 only has 1500 watt, which will trip your circuit breaker if being used by other electric appliances.
And the HeatSafe was about half the price of the Pelonis HC-451.  
Oh yeah!  The best thing for keeping your outdoor cats warm (I'm allergic to furry animals, so they can NOT be in the house!) is a "Heated Kitty Pad".  I bought 2 of these for my wife's cats, and they just love them !

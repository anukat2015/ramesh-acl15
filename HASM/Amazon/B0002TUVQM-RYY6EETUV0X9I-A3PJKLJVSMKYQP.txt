Title: I have bought 4 in two years!
Content:
I love this little machine! It does a great job. The only problem is you get what you pay for: it only last about 6 months of daily use.
I use it for preparing my ritual cup of Chai tea (Big Train Vanilla Chai) almost every morning.
It requires cleaning by hand. It will keep your drink hot if you leave the button in the "on" position. Only problem here is it gets too hot and begins to melt the plastic propeller mechanism on the bottom of the pitcher unit.
I wish someone made a heavy duty unit that would last longer and was affordable. Until that happens, I'll just keep buying a new one every six months.

Title: Great Purchase!
Content:
As soon as I started using this vacuum I knew I had made the right choice. It is easy to use, relatively quited and does a great job at cleaning both the tile and carpet in my house. My refurbished model looks as if it is brand new and you can't find anything good in stores at this price. It is also a very nice looking vacuum, unlike most of what you see in stores that look cheap and junky. The controls are on the handle which is very convinient. I have a king size bed that is only 6 inches off the ground and the pivotting handle makes it easy to clean all the way underneath. The only worry I had when buying this vacuum is that I read it can short out if left plugged in but not turned on. I've only read that for reviews of the A model and I'm not sure if the have fixed that problem for the B model or not. So far no problems, but I just make a point to unplug it whenever I am done. I spent a lot of time looking at vacuum reviews before I purchased and I would highly recommend this model if you want a bagless canister.

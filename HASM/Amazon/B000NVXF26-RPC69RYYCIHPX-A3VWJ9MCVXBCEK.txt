Title: Olympus E510 Digital Camera (Body Only)
Content:
Camera has some features similar to my previous E-500 model.  Am still experimenting with Live View which I have little use for, since the action shots I shoot aren't effectively viewed on the LCD, the action has moved by the time the shutter goes off.  The image stabilization seems to work good.  I do alot of portrait work with a 50mm prime Olympus lens and its bokeh is awesome.  The colors, even when set to vivid, are not as colorful as compared with the sensor on the E500.  I am tweaking it and appears a bit more to my liking, a twinge more color and contrast.  I will be experimenting more with the settings on sunnier days, since my review was based on overcast days.  Overall, very happy with the camera.  I would recommend this camera to anyone interested in getting in a DSLR, but allow yourself enough time to read, read, read books and any on-line information you can find regarding setting it up for optimal performance and working knowledge of the E510.  For newbies, there is a big learning curve, but after a few weeks or months? and with the basics down you can now expand and fine tune this camera for terrific photos.

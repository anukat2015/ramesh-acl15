Title: Great for coffee lovers with different tastes!
Content:
I thought about purchasing a single cup brewer since my wife wants to use decaf, while I like regular coffee. When she started brewing half strength coffee, it was time to make the move. I investigated several brewers. This one seemed like the right choice: it had a large variety of coffees available in the K-Cup format and allowed me to use regular ground coffee in the K-Cup filter insert you can buy separately. We've used it for 3 weeks now. I like the 2 cup size option. I also appreciate that the water reservoir is large enough to last for 2 days before refilling it. It brews a perfect cup each time, at the right temperature for drinking - not too hot or cold. The K cups allow me to keep the coffee fresh until it is used. The warm up time from first turning the unit on until you can brew, is relatively short, so you can make a cup sooner that you would using a regular brewer. Overall, I am very pleased with the unit. I hope it holds up as long as regular coffeemakers, since it is a bit pricey compared to a standard countertop unit.

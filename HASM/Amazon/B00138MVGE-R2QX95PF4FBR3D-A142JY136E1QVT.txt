Title: What a great camera
Content:
I waited a long time for the Nikon D80 to come down in price. While I was at the store ready to purchase the D80 the guy behind the counter introduced me to this A350. I have a few Minolta Lenses so it seemed like a great fit. I was a little skeptical at first but let me tell you, this is a great camera. I have taken more than 700 photos including my kids playing, storms, Lightning, and even long exposure night photos of the sky. I have had some KILLER photos come out of this camera. I am highly impressed and I have no regrets in choosing this camera over the D80. The only downside that I saw in the beginning was the 2.5 photos per second vs the d80's 3.? per second. I can handle that. I would highly recommend at least a 4 gig card but get the 8gig.I have the 8 gig and I currently have about 720 photos stored at highest res. about 14mb per photo on the card with plenty of room left.

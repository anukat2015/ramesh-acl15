Title: Can't find a thing to complain about ... (casual user)
Content:
Everything has worked as advertised and as a Vista convert (well, I still must use for work) I'm giddy over the update process, the quick response on boot times and shutting down, power consumption and overall ergonomics.
I have had the MB since October and not one complaint. (I must say I purchased this because I was not happy with the audio out of the 32GB 2nd Gen Ipod I purchased - tried 4 of them)
I watch DVD's, Napster, Skype... easy enough to carry everywhere and listen to music / multimedia... I also tether my BB Curve and it works every time.
Ciao...

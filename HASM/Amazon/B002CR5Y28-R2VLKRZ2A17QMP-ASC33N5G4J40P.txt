Title: Who Knew I'd Love Vacuuming?
Content:
OK, so I don't love it, but it's so much easier than with my old Kenmore canister.  This vacuum is lightweight but powerful, and does everything from bare floors to low pile rugs.  A word to the wise - if you're trying to decide between this vacuum and the Polaris, spend the extra money and buy this model if you have any area rugs at all.  Even though the Polaris says it will do low pile, it doesn't, and I returned it for that reason.
This vacuum is quiet and makes the chore go faster.  I could even talk to my husband while vacuuming, that's how quiet it is.  The suction is powerful - you'll never need the high setting unless you're trying to get pet hair out of crazy glue or something.  The only negative is the exterior tool caddy - it's a bit clunky.  I just remove the tools I'm not planning to use.  Also, put some velcro or foam on the outside of the canister in case you bump into furniture - kind of like a homemade bumper guard.  Other than that, great vacuum!

Title: Sweet design notes
Content:
I purchased this coffee maker for work about two years ago. I have used it since for coffee about 5-6 times a week. I really appreciate the design notes: most coffee makers I have encountered in work environments have several places that tend to just gather coffee residue, which is just gross after a while. The B&D design uses a big reservoir which you can pop out to rinse out or fill for coffee; a thermal carafe which keeps the coffee in the drinkably warm temperature range for about 5 hours (make sure to take the carafe out from under the filter and to tighten up the top!); and the filter holder can also be rotated out and then removed for cleaning.
I wish it was a bit cheaper, but it's super solid, and the coffee from the carafe stays warm without burning!
Just for some perspective, I've purchased many things on amazon, but I believe this is my first review!

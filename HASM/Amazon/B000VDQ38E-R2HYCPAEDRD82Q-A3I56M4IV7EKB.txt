Title: What a breeze on carpet and hardwood floors
Content:
We purchased this Bissell Pet Vacuum a month ago and couldn't be happier.  We have a Golden Retriever and Gordon Setter that are indoor pets.  Our hardwood floors always collect the hair and with this vacuum it picks up the hair with the suction of no other vacuum we've owned.  Cleaning carpet is a breeze also.  If I could redesign it, I would make the collection chamber twice as big as it is currently.  It requires changing more often, but other than that it is great.

Title: Wait until you try to change the belt!!
Content:
Honestly, do the designers of these things ever try them out???  I thought I would break my fingers trying to manuever the belt and roller in place and I did cut myself!  And have the right screwdrivwer handy - there are 6 screws to take out!!Yes, it picks up cat and dog hair just fine, but be careful not to break the #%!**# belt!!

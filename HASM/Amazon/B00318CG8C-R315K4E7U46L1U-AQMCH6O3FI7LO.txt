Title: Perfect Blend - Mobile and Capable
Content:
I purchased my DM3 w/ AMD Processor a few weeks ago.  I was in the market for a MacBook Pro but when it came to time to submit my order in the Apple Checkout area, I decided to do some more research.  I couldn't fathom paying nearly twice as much as the DM3 for a 13" MacBook Pro.  
I appreciate the lightness of the DM3 at 4.2lbs.  You're easily able to move from room to room with it in one hand or carry it around in a notebook sleeve.  Additionally, the mostly aluminum build and chick-let style keyboard are nearly ergonomically and aesthetically perfect. I call it my little HP Envy.  
My DM3 came with 4GB of RAM, a 500GB HD, and a separate, sleek External HP-Branded DVD Media Drive.  I love the Bluetooth functionality and the HDMI port.  It makes it easy to connect to my cell or LCD TV.  (I've connected it with BlackBerrys, Palm Pres, Android phones, and an iPhone with no issues.  It also connects with other PCs with no problem.) 
Despite what some reviewers may say, I haven't experienced any lag even with resource intensive programs like iTunes and Norton Security Suite running in the background.  I've routinely had YouTube running, with Microsoft Word, iTunes and Norton Security Suite running a virus scan in the background and not experienced an appreciable lag in performance.  
I highly recommend this computer if you're looking for something portable, stylish, and functional.  It is all of these things and more.  Shop around and enjoy it.

Title: Great DSLR
Content:
I did a lot of research and decided between the XSI and the XS.  I chose to get the best that I could afford.  The pictures have been great.  I am still learning how to use it.  The IS lens is wonderful.  Check out the pictures from the XSI on flickr.com.  I would definitely recommend (and I actually have) the XSI as a great DSLR starter camera.
I have also purchased the 55-250mm lens and enjoy taking pictures with it.  The picture quality is superb.  
Finally, I would suggest online tutorials on dslr cameras, or joining a local user group.  These have helped me greatly by explaining how aperature, shutter speed, and iso work together.

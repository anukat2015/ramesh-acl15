Title: darth vader's coffee maker
Content:
This is the coffee maker that Darth Vader uses to brew up a pot of coffee before he oppressing the Rebellion.  It looks great.  The only draw back is that the coffee is not as piping hot as I might like.  This is easily fixed by priming the thermal pitcher with hot water.  So aside from this coffee maker being part and parcel to an evil Sith overlord, its great.

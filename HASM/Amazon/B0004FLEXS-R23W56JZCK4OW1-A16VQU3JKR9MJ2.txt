Title: good coffee, flimsy construction
Content:
Bought this unit based on recommendation in "a major consumer magazine".  It makes good coffee, no complaints there, but it is very flimsy.  One of the plastic hinges on the top of the unit broke off the first time I used it, and the top of the carafe pops off with any handling at all (though it easily snaps back on).  I generally only make coffee on weekends, but if you're going to use it all the time, you might want to consider a more stoutly constructed unit.  Two smaller things: the red digital time display is extremely bright, annoyingly so for me but might be a plus for others.  And the auto-shutoff on the warmer is two hours, shorter than I would prefer but again might be preferable for some users.

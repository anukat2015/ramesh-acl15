Title: Not bad, not great
Content:
The ASUS is indeed light and pretty, and the battery does last quite long. However, it isn't as slick as I hoped it would be. Windows 7 is quite slow, Outlook runs slow and the worst is the Audio - just not high enough. You can't watch a movie if there is noise around the room.

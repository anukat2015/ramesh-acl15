Title: you don't want to buy this
Content:
Problems to install adobe programs are real, it does happen!  Glossy screen truly sucks, all you can see is your reflexs as a mirror! The whole thing seems to be pretty cheap, feels very plastic and key buttons are not even nice!  i had it for one day and inmediately sold it for a hundred dollars less, still i think that's better! I got an alienware instead, of course for doble the price but i already learned the lesson, If it's cheap it's not a bargain, it's probably not so good! Besides HP is a company that is all about ads! You know what comercials do in people's mind, believe me, this machines are not worthy!

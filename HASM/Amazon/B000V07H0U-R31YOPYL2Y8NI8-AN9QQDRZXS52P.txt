Title: Gourmet coffee at a cube steak price
Content:
Great coffee maker! Easy to use. Excellent coffee. Convenient features. Points lost for no adjustable off time or adjustable heat setings. Clock/timer setting a little funky - Takes time to get used to. Convenient coffee filter - The best I've used so far! Microscreen instead of the usual garden variety permanent filter others use. Result is less mud at the bottom of the pot!!! Also very convenient water resevoir - Comes out for easy filling. Good design - Doesn't leak!!!!! Carafe is drip resistant. All glass rim instead of plastic which lends itself to dripping by the very nature of the plastic rims others use. Handy cord storage - Pull out just what you need to. All around great product. Just hope it lasts longer than others I've bought costing over 2x what this one cost.

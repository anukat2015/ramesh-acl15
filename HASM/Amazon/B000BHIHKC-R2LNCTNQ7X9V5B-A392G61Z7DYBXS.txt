Title: great little product
Content:
I like this little coffee maker. It is quick, convenient and doesn't have a lot of waste like a regular coffee maker. Your coffee doesn't sit in the pot and get cold or over heated. You do need to read the directions before setting it up to avoid unnescessary frustration. This product is a a good value for the price.

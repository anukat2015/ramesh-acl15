Title: TERRIBLE
Content:
I have had this unit for two days now. I bought it for a road trip, and the first thing i did on the road trip was try to watch a movie and the player froze. It stayed froze and there was no way of turning it off except either, wait for the battery to run out, or push the reset button.  Since i was on a road trip the reset button wasnt an option and the battery didnt run out until we were done driving. The second time i used the M I was scrolling through menus and it froze for the second time in two days that i had it. I either got an extremelly faulty unit or this product needs major work. Get yourself an ipod, it costs the same amount, but at least you know your getting a product you can trust.

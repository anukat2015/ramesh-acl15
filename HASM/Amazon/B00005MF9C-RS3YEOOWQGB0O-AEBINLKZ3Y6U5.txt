Title: Great personal coffee maker
Content:
I purchased two of these to take with me and my parents on vacation.  They are very light and easily fit in the suitcase.  Both worked exceptional.  It makes a 15oz cup in less than 2 minutes.  We used a paper filter instead of the permanent filter for ease of cleanup.  It never had a problem with overflow or putting grounds in the cup.  It shuts off as soon as the brewing is done and quickly finished dripping through the filter.  The coffee (or water) is extremely hot and I needed to wait a bit before I was able to drink it.  I will be taking this with me anytime I travel in the future.  I highly recommend this coffee maker.

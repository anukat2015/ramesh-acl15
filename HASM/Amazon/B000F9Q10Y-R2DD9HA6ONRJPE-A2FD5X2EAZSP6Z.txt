Title: keys are too light to the touch.
Content:
Everything is perfect for this Gateway laptop for the price. My only problem is the keys are light to the touch. Or that the keyboard was cheaply manufactured. It seems like the keyboard has been used for a year or so. I prefer hard and sturdy key buttons when purchasing a new laptop or any product for that matter.

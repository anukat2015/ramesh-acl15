Title: Great coffee maker.....for lefties
Content:
I bought this coffee maker to replace a similar Black and Decker coffee maker that was 8 years old and beginning to show its age.
Just like the previous one, this is a great coffee maker for a single person living alone who only drinks one cup of coffee each day.
I'd have given it 5 stars except that unlike the previous coffee maker, it seems that this one was designed for left-handed people which I'm not. You port the water in on the left, the switch is on the left, etc., etc.
Would have been perfect if they'd maintained the either handed design of the coffee maker it replaced.

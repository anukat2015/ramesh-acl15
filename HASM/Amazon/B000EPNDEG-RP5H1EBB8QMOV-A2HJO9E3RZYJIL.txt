Title: iPod Died 34 days after Warranty Expired!!!
Content:
And Apple refused to fix it for me.  I can understand if I did something wrong, like drop it or get it wet, but all I did was use it for music listening?  $300 and now I have nothing?  That just does not seem fair.  But the first thing all the Apple Customer Service Rep's said was that I should have purchased the extended warranty!  For spending $300, you would think you could at least get a product that would last a few years!!  Thanks Steve Jobs!  Make sure that stock price keeps going so you can exercise some more backdated options.  Criminal----just like Martha Stewart.

Title: Variable suction, washable HEPA filter, power brush for carpets
Content:
My wife says she likes this vacuum because it has good suction and it has variable levels of suction.
She also likes the washable HEPA filter, which means she saves some money by not having to buy replacements.
The power brush for the carpet cleans better than a normal vacuum, she said.
The retractable power cord is another plus. Fortunately, we live in a single-level home, so the vacuum weight isn't an issue. It can be pulled around the house with ease. However, if your house is multi-level, you should be aware the base (including canister) is heavy.

Title: Super camera, more than just an Entry DSLR
Content:
The D50 is a solid little camera, it's versatile, works great with different lenses, low noise even at 800 ISO, I won a betterphoto.com competition with a photograph produced by the D50. The pre-sets are OK, but if you want to draw out the full potential of this camera then go manual or shutter/aperture priority.
I upgraded to the D200 and now my husband and son are using the D50 for shooting, the D200 has a few extra bells and whistles but for an "entry" level DSLR the D50 is just perfect!
I never had any problems with anything not working, it all works perfectly, produces stunning colors and super sharp images.
Too bad they stopped producing the D50, what a neat camera! Can't go wrong with it! I have owned it for almost 3 years and have shot over 60000 images with it!

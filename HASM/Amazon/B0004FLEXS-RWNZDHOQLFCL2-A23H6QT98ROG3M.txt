Title: Pleased with coffeemaker
Content:
We have low cabinets and my main priority was finding a coffeemaker that would fit easily under the cabinets.  The bonus is that this coffeemaker performs very nicely.  It's easy to program and set times.  I just wish it had the extra feature of being able to make it stay on longer than an hour.

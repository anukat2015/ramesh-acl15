Title: Second E-330  for longevity
Content:
This is the second E-330 I've bought. I take underwater pictures with the camera in an Ikelite housing. I have the 14-54 Zuiko lens and have had no trouble with the camera. Live view mode "A" is great for quick moving underwater creatures. I get to use the LCD to frame my shot instead of trying to look through the veiwfinder with my mask on. The newer models have not had mode "A" and so are not as useful to me. The Ike housing is expensive so I decided to get a second E-330 body to extend its useful life.
The only negative that I've run into may be due to the lens and not the camera. I started my underwater picture taking career with the C-5050 which has a very bright lens and will lock focus (not always on what you want) in very low light conditions. The set-up I have with the E-330 often does not focus in cloudy or dark water (not enough contrast).
I'll be using this combination for as long as the cameras and housing hold up - hopefully a long, long time.

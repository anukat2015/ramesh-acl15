Title: Love This Laptop
Content:
This is my very 1st laptop, and 2nd HP computer. Originally I was looking for another desktop, as I didn't feel I could afford a laptop with decent specs. But I came across this while browsing. The price point was very good and I couldn't believe how loaded it was. Very fast, love the HD briteview wide screen. Loads up in decent time, even with all the bloatware and preinstalled Norton crap. It also has a handy little remote to run HP's media center. All in all I am very pleased with this computer.

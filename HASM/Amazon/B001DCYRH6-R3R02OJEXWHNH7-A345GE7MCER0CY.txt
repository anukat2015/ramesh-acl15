Title: Not the best for hardwood floors
Content:
Nice, decent suction, great portability.  The problems are the tools dont' work that well on hard surfaces... better than suction and than most small vacuums that I've seen, but not great (pretty good for the price though).  Also, I hate the cord.  I actually wish it were shorter, the cord is so long that it gets tangled all the time and I've stopping wrapping it.  I'm sure some like the longer cord, but I would have liked it a bit shorter, so as to be less unwieldy.
Overall a good buy and much more "usable" than my old kirby for my house that has no carpet.  
PS empty the bag frequently, might be a problem with folks with allergies (like me), but it's better than buying a bunch of disposable bags for the rest of your life and filling the land fills.

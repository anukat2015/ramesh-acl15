Title: Light, compact , power and a washable HEPA filter
Content:
After much research and reading these reviews, I decided to order the EL6988A to replace an old Kenmore canister. I found a much better price than the standard prices listed on most websites so research is important. My new vacuum arrived in one day with no shipping cost. To use a format used by another user which I found quite helpful:
Pro's
Very eary to set up - took less than 5 minutes. Bag and filter already in machine
Light weight and easy to carry
Good power and suction control right at the handle
Washable HEPA filter (they say good for 2 - 3 years)
Well rated for control of dust, pollen and other irritants
Large floor attachment (along with other attachments)
Con's 
Small bag - but as someone said the cost is around $1.00 per bag which is not too bad
Attachments do not fit inside the machine (this is obviously due to the compact size of the vacuum which makes it light). A little inconvenient if you use attachments all the time. 
Overall, it is a very good value with good features when compared to the prices for some of the other higher-end vacuums.

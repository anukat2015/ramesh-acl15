Title: Very nice camera to follow Sony's heritage
Content:
By all means it is very capable, quick, and well made camera that takes big deal over  Minolta's legacy. This camera is distinctively "Sony" while it still incorporates many of nice findings pioneered by swallowed Minolta. 
I played with this camera for couple of days and found there's much to love about the ways it suggests. The lens is terrific. I guess it is the same lens that was permanently mounted to DSC-R1 and by all accounts it is glorious lens. The sharpness, clarity, transparency of it, all across the field is simply second to none. It is hard to touch another lens after trying this. In DSC-R1 just the lens itself was worth the purchase! The range of the lens is exceptionally convenient and extends trough the range that is appropriate with hand holding shooting. Reinforced by Sony's shake reduction it provides complete and very dependable tool for shooting anything with the lens under practically any condition. You must see the full size images this lens on the camera produces to concede it was worth many words. Today, there are many superb cameras on a market and Sony made smart move by offering premium glass in somewhat accessible price range as it makes the whole system very sweet and desirable.
Great camera, great lens.

Title: Awesome Product

"Let me start by saying I have bought 2 Kenmore cannisters in the last 25 years and thought they were the best until now. I didn't want to invest 300$ at this time and I wanted something to handle the mass hair from my dog. The reviews I read raved about this unit. They did not come close to how great this unit is. Not only did it pick up dog hair I had no idea was in the carpet, it picked up dirt, borax powder, that carpet powder that has been sprinkled over the years. I vacummed a spot for five minutes, emptied the cannister, and went over the same spot again and it still sucked things out of the carpet I never saw. I thought I needed to clean my beige carpet, it was getting pretty dirty from traffic, it has pulled out so much dirt from the fibers I probably only need to clean in spots. I filled a plastic grocery bag with 1/2 hair and 1/2 dirt in one good vacuuming of my small duplex, and I vacummed at least three times a week with my kenmore. THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME !!!!! MIGHT HAVE TO KEEP THE DOG...."

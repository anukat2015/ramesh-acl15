Title: VERY Noisy. Have fun refilling this unit with water to get 13000 BTU.
Content:
I admit, I got suckered into buying this unit because of the marketing and slick featureset. What a disappointment. 
I am returning it as quickly as possible, and would probably avoid Delonghi products going forward. I was trying to get information on where to buy replacement filters from Delonghi USA (& Canada), the former did not reply to several emails (USA tech support), and the latter - the Canadian support email bounced (no such mailbox). What a joke. 
PROS: 
Really nice & modern color scheme, graphite and silver. 
Pretty blue LCD that displays everything you need to know. 
Eco-friendly refrigerant 
Side handles (because its very heavy) 
3M Biosilver Techsystem 
CONS: 
VERY Noisy - sounds like an old dishwasher when cooling in Water to Air mode (swishing noise, I am guessing the rotary engine cooling off using the water). 
Water refilling to get optimal cooling (to get 13K BTU) is annoying & frequent (Tested on a very hot day I had to refill it every 6 hours), I would bet that most people would give up on this eventually. Without the water, this unit does 9000 BTU in air cooling. 
Huge - This thing is only portable due to the casters. Very bulky. 
No Oscillating Louvers! The air is blown up in one direction, no choice. 
No information on how (part#?) or where to buy the 3M filters that should be replaced once a year. 
Heavy - Perhaps I'm being picky here, but this thing is so heavy (128 lbs). 
What I recommend instead: The Sharp CVP10MX, as most people here (Amazon) have had a great experience with it. I recommend you have a look.

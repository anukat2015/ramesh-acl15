Title: Superb
Content:
I already had one of these and got a second because my husband and I share the vacuuming.  I love the fact it is super quiet and does a great job on hardwoods and area rugs.  This is a slightly newer model than my first and the only thing I noticed is the newer one is not as quiet as the older--but it's still way quieter than any other vacuum I've ever had.  All my kitties stay out while we vacuum, where as with the older louder ones, many would run and hide!

Title: Gift of the White Elephant
Content:
After four months of owning this coffee maker, I am reminded of the "Gift of the White Elephant."  This is the story of the faithful citizen who was rewarded for his loyalty to the king.  For his loyalty, he was given the realm's most unique creature; an albino elephant.  The citizen thankfully accepted.  Within a year, however, the citizen and his family were peniless and starving due to the maintenance required in raising this spectacular creature.
PROS
Flavorful coffee
Convenience of pre-brewed coffee awaiting you in the AM
Stylish appearance
You no longer need to set your bedroom alarm clock***
CONS
***Painfully loud grind and brew system.  If you live in an apartment or townhouse, you will be awakened to this machine each morning.  The banging you hear on the walls will be your neighbors cursing your very existance.  Embarassingly loud!
Intricate parts require substantial hand cleaning
No grind consistancy control
Difficult to read the water level
Difficult to pour without spilling...stock up on paper towels
BOTTOM-LINE
I've now taken to running an extension cord from the wall to the machine.  Each night, I move it away from the walls and set it up in the middle of my living room so I won't disturb my neighbors with the jet-engine-like grind system.  This "white elephant" is not worth the trouble, folks.

Title: Great Tasting Brew
Content:
I had read the reviews on this model and the BUNN thermal coffee makers, my goal being to invest a bit more in a coffee maker and have it last longer than the better part of a year.  I drink a great deal of coffee in the morning, not much the rest of the day so once I found out that BUNN heated water when it was plugged in, I opted for the Cusinart.  I was worried about the luke warm comments I saw posted here but I haven't experienced this yet.  Even towards midday, my coffee was still fresh and hot enough, though I suppose that will change as the carafe temps dip in my 50 degree winter kitchen without pre heating the carafe with hot water.  The most impressive thing for me was the coffee flavor.  I'd given up on good tasting coffee at home but the simple filter in the resevoir does marvels for my heavily chlorinated mineralized tap water.  So far so good, we'll see how well it holds up long term to my hard water.

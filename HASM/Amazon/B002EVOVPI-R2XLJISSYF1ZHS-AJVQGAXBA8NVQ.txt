Title: Almost Perfect
Content:
The ONLY negatives that I have is with the pot. The lid is attached to the pot which makes it awkward to clean. Plus, when you pour the coffee, the lid swings away, over the cup. It should snap on. Make a replacement pot and I'll buy it. The ability to adjust the grind and intensity is wonderful and makes grest coffee. I like being able to add enough beans for a few days.

Title: Olympus E-510
Content:
This is an excillent camera(so underrated) and I also use a Nikon D-80, Fuji s100fs.
The lenses are the only ones I am aware of that get updates by themselves over the internet with Olympus software. Features that are too numerous to list but the pictures are pristine. Any talk of lower dynamic range just do not show from my wildlife pictures and I have taken a lot for years. Started with an E-300 loved so much > E-500 loved even more and the bargain of all time the E-510. Build perfect quality and you know when holding. The lenses are not cheap but the 18-180mm may be the last lens you ever buy! Just a beautiful camera for almost "point and shoot" cash. Go for it!

Title: Enjoyed it for the 2 Winters it lasted
Content:
Bought the White version of this in 2008, used it to heat a 13 X 13 bedroom.  The unit did ok, I only ran it between work and bed time to keep me warm while working on the computer.  This winter used it to heat a 350 sq foot attic bedroom, If I left the unit running over night it would make a difference in the whole room. But I used it mainly for spot heating, moving it to wherever I was in the room.  It stopped working this spring, first the panel would light but no heat, then it worked again for a week now completely dead.  I am not happy that it died with less then a year of use, between the two winters maybe 8 mo running time.  I think for many people this heater would NOT be sufficient, but I was ok with my rooms being 68 or lower and found this a nice portable heater to sit next to me when working on my computer wrapped in a blanket or to heat my small bathroom for nice long soaks in the tub.  I will probably buy another one and hope it lasts longer, I really liked its features and how easy it was to move, worked good in very small rooms and for heating my own personal space bubble.  Wish they were cheaper I would be tempted to sneak one into my cube at work.

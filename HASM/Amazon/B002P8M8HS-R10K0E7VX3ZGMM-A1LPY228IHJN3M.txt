Title: Good Laptop
Content:
We use this laptop with a few people in our family and are generally very happy with it.  We have two to three people logged into separate accounts at any one time, and the computer works fast at the tasks that we perform (we're not gamers).
The only bad thing to say about this laptop is the mouse touchpad.  I use an HP at work and it's much better.  Sometimes, this touchpad seems to have trouble sensing the touches.  I've changed the settings to turn off many of the "features" associated with the mouse, but things improved only marginally.
Battery life isn't great, but that's clear from the description.
The screen seems very nice.  It gives a good picture and has a wide range of brightness settings.
I'm happy with the purchase!

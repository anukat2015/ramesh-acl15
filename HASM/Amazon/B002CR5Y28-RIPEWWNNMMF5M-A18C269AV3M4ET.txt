Title: Love my vacuum!
Content:
I had purchased a run of the mill vacuum at the store. It was horrible, heavy and didn't do much. Needless to say, vacuuming became a chore I avoided more than I should have. I researched quite a bit and found that the Neptune had great reviews and was only 14 pounds. Well, that isn't much heavier than a bowling ball! I could handle that!  Well, I opened it tonight and vacuumed the whole house. I love it!
Pros:
Light
Quiet
Pretty
Compact - smaller than I thought
Sucks up everything
I would list the price as a con, but I can't.  I think it is well worth the money because it works very well and it is just what I was looking for.  So...if you have smaller home and need something really light and effective, I think this might be the perfect choice!

Title: almost perfect.
Content:
I love this vacuum. The good points:
*It is light (about 12lbs.) and easy to carry up/down stairs
*It is quiet when running (for a vacuum cleaner anyway)
*Has 3 onboard attachments- they're stored neatly under a little door on the vac body
*HEPA filtration
*Rectractable cord
*Handle telescopes in/out so you can change the length
*Looks super cute and stylish.  Looks as nice as a Miele at a much better price
*Easy to change the bags
 I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't like the way the vac head and the attachments attach to the main handle.  You just push them together and hope they hold.  There is no "click" or latch to hold them together.  I was using it yesterday and the head just plopped off. I had to stop and push it back on, but then it stayed.  Also, the replacement bags are a bit pricey, but that's part of the nice air filtration, so I don't mind too much.  Overall, it's been a GREAT machine so far.

Title: Defective product
Content:
We have owned many of these heaters over the years, using them in apartments we owned.  We did not hesitate to buy another.
However, the one we received is defective and we will begin its return immediately.  The very first week we began using it, it started leaking oil.  We have never had this in any of the other units we have owned.
We will be returning for an exchange immediately.  I am eager to see how smoothly this goes.  My first communication will be with my credit card company, advising them of the need to return this purchase.

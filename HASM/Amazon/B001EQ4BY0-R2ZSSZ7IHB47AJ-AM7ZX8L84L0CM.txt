Title: 50D as a Pro tool
Content:
A DSLR can provide a lot of benefits over a simple point and shoot camera. With a DSLR, you'll get faster shooting speeds, better optics (and therefore a better quality picture), the ability to change lenses for ultimate flexibility, complete control over image exposure, sharpness, other image quality settings and a lot more.
Like many products, there are entry-level DSLRs, professional-grade D-SLRs, and plenty of models in between. Canon's 50D blurs the line between amateur and professional D-SLR cameras. This camera strikes a good balance with its price and feature set. With the 50D, you get a lot of features you wouldn't find on entry-level models such as Superior burst speed 6.3fps, weather sealed body, All nine autofocus points on the 50D are of the cross type variety, while on the T1i / 500D, only the center one is, Maximum shutter speed of 1/8000s, White balance in Kelvin, The viewfinder in the 50D uses a pentaprism while a pentamirror is used for the viewfinder in the 500D. Pentaprism viewfinders give a brighter and larger image compared to pentamirror types. But you won't pay professional-grade prices. Users who are just making the jump to a DSLR, for example will appreciate the 50D's Live View mode, which lets you use the DSLR's LCD to frame an image, similar to the way you would frame an image using a point and shoot camera. For more advanced shooters, the 50D also has full manual controls to give you all the traditional adjustments in image staging for your photographs.

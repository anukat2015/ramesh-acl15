Title: Best single serve maker by far!!
Content:
Can't say enough about this machine. Breville has done a fantastic job. I too have always owned a traditional coffee maker and was a little skeptical at first to consider a single serve brewer. The more I weighed out the benefits it really made alot of sense. Then I began to compare units....the Breville is more expensive up front than its competitors, but it is also far superior in every aspect. Quality, ease of use, and design are worth every penny. The unit is solid where the others were flimsy by comparison. The my k-cup and water filtering system are standard as they are optional on the competitors units, so when you really compare price to product, the Breville really does stand apart. Brewing is so easy and it produces a perfect cup of coffee, tea or hot cocoa every time. My kids love it and want to use it. And don't worry about selection, there are literally hundreds of selections available and new selections all the time. Be sure to consider this machine before you buy.... I promise you will be impressed too.

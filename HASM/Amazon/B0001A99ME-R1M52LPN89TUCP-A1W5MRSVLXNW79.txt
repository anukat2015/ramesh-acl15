Title: A miniature beauty
Content:
I've owned my iPod mini for 5 months nows and continue to enjoy using it as much as I did the first week I owned it.  A few notes:
PROS:
- easy to navigate controls & intuitive programming; my sister tried mine out and exclaimed several times, "it's so smart!"  Doesn't take much time to get the hang of how it works.
- excellent sound
- eyecatching exterior
- comes with iTunes, a straightforward, easy to use program for organizing your music.  From here you can purchase music online or upload your own CDs.  
- comes with a sturdy beltclip, which is handy when you're at the gym or engaged in outdoor activities 
- comprehensive user manual 
CONS:
- a little pricey
- stock earbuds get uncomfortable after more than an hour of use
- my iPod mini froze once after siblings tweaked with it; however, the user manual provided instructions on how to reset it & the issue resolved
- though you can browse through music available in other iTune stores (e.g., the Canadian or Belgian stores), if the song is not also in the American store you will not be able to download it.  I'm still waiting for the Tragically Hip's "Phantom Power" CD to come to the US!
Final Verdict: worth the pretty penny it costs

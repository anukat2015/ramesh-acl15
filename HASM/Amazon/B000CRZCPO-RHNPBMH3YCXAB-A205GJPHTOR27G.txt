Title: Awesome camera!
Content:
I have been using this camera for a little less then one year. When I first bought it, I was not sure about my decision to spend so much money on a camera, and right now, I'm very happy with my purchase. and those who doubted this purchase, are not believers after seeing picture after picture. Reasons to buy the camera.
*	Beautiful pictures, especially with additional flash. 
*	I dropped my D200 in McDonalds from about 4 feet height, it fell on the tiled floor, you should have heard the booming sound, my heart stopped, I thought that was the end of my camera. I picked it up, not even a scratch or a dent appeared from the fall. 6 months since the fall, still works flawlessly.  
*	Very easy to use, you will not find more thoughtful and useful design for such great price.
*	Very reliable, performs flawlessly every time. Great camera to catch every life's moment. 
My D200 was used on my wedding, and by now I probably have taken close to 10,000 pictures. I also recommend buying SB-400 flash and additional battery for this camera.

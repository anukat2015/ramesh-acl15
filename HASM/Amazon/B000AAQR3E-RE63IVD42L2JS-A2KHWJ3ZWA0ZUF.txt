Title: Great machine; note that no basic floor tool included
Content:
The vacuum itself is lightweight, has great power and is amazingly quiet for its performance. Note that "NOW INCLUDES: SBB300-3 Parquet Floor Tool" is misleading since that's the *only* floor tool included. That tool works great on bare floors, but it doesn't work at all for carpets. 
At this writing, if you purchase this machine and have carpets, you'll also have to purchase a floor tool that works with carpets. I ended up buying the optional turbo brush (an extra $120+) which works amazingly well for a non-electronic brush, but it wasn't a cost I had planned on. You could also get the general purpose floor tool for less that works with carpets and bare floors. After the purchase I checked other dealers who sell this model, and they state it only comes with the parquet floor tool. It would be helpful if the Amazon product description made this clear as well.

Title: coffee4me
Content:
The first few weeks I used this coffee maker I LOVED IT!  The coffee was hot and delicious.  And then one morning I came downstairs to find coffee all over my counter, down my white cabinets and sitting on my wood floors.  I thought it was just fluke and cleaned it up and made a new pot.  Then this started happening more and more often.  You have to line everything up PERFECTLY!  Make sure everything is in properly or you will have an overflow to clean up!  I wish this coffee maker were not so tempermental, because it does make a great pot of coffee, but I got so tired of the gamble that I bought a new coffee maker.

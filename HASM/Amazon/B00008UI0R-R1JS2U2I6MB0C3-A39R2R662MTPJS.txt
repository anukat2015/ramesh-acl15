Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
It performs much better than the Sears bagless we had that cost twice as much. It's also considerably lighter and easier to pull around.Dirt receptacle is easy to clean and although small, will still clean a lot of rooms before you have to empty. Works great with pet hair. Very long cord which is needed at times. Would highly recommend!!

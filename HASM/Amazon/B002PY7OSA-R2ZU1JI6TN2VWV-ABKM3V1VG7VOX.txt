Title: Excellent Value
Content:
I got one of these from Dell and have been immensely satisfied with it. 
Pros:
- Truly gorgeous and bright screen.
- Laptop's cheese-wedge-shaped design is great because there's not a large "ledge"
- Good performance, comes with good video card and supports up to 8 GB RAM. I do a lot of 3D modeling and this has made my life so much easier compared to my old machine.
- Second headphone jack makes it perfect for watching DVDs with your buddy while you're stuck in Afghanistan
- Windows 7 works like a champ and looks great
- Facial recognition software (FastAccess) makes login fast, easy, somewhat fun (not sure if Amazon config has this). May not work if the room lighting is weird.
- Attractive design, battery has fair life and doesn't stick out like the badonkadonk my wife's HP. 
- Laptop speakers that don't suck. Awesome. Also convenient, responsive media controls.
- Quiet keyboard. Not sure if this config has the backlit version, but if so you are in for a treat. Very nifty and useful in low light.
- Easy 1-door access panel on bottom for upgrade action
- SD/Media Card reader to get your camera photos, etc
Cons: 
- Can get warm. Best used in combination with a Zalman ZM-NC2000 Notebook cooler. The cooler runs off USB (but you don't lose a port because it has some on it), keeps the laptop from getting warm, and fits perfectly. I suggest the black one.
- Somewhat hefty. But hey, it's a "desktop replacement" size.
- Only 3 USB ports
- No number pad functionality
All things considered I'm very pleased with my purchase and I can definitely recommend this model laptop for for someone who travels occasionally but not frequently.

Title: You will need a new hard drive.
Content:
Since I have gotten this camera I have shot 3000 pics.  Thats how you get the priceless shots is by shooting, shooting shooting.  I paired mine with a 8 gig card.  Think that is about right. gets about 1400 jpg files.  Much less if you shoot RAW. 
Just an amateur shooter but have gotten some very nice pics.  Video mode is not quite as useful as I had hopped,  but I know that it was not a replacement for a video camera.  After learning the basics, I am learning 1 feature at a time. I love being able to take 4.5 pics per sec.  Wonderful for capturing non-flash action. Flash slows it down considerably.  Battery life,  no complaints. has been great. Nikon Software is not bad either. 
Would have gotten 5 stars except for the cons below. 
Cons:  Have gotten a few errors,  had to drop the battery and reset the lens.  Apparently the lens contacts are sometimes flaky.  Re-seating the lens does the trick.  And has not done it for quite awhile.  Think exercising the lens on the body occasionally is good for it.  Video limitations as seen on other reviews.

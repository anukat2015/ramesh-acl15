Title: 3rd generation Apple 8 gb iPod nano
Content:
The iPod came as described in perfect condition - however the seller took 3 weeks past the promised date to get it to me.  Figure that the seller did not have the item on hand and had to wait to receive the iPod and then send it to me!  The bottom line is - if you want the iPod Nano cheaper than found locally or on the web, be prepared to wait for it!

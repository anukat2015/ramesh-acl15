Title: Surpasses expectations
Content:
I had a mighty mite years ago, and was always impressed with it.  It finally died after more than a decade of use (could have fixed it, Sanitare products are fully modular).  After much dissapointment I finally came back to the tried and true.  Light weight, powerful suction, large capacity bag, optional hepa filter, and average noise.  I'm very pleased, everything is performing admirably, and I know if anything fails, I can easily order a replacement part and just as easily replace it myself.  I would strongly recommend ordering plenty of bags if you buy this vac, they aren't carried at most stores, the best resource for ordering them has been right here at Amazon.

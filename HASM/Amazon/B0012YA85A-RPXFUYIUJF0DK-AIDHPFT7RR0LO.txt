Title: Great Camera for the money.
Content:
The kit lens is a little bit slow, and while it produces decent pictures, the canon ef 50mm f/1.8 lens that I bought blows it away. If I had to do it all over again, I would've bought just the body and a couple 24mm f/2.8 and 50mm f/1.8. If you don't have a lot of extra money to spend on lenses though, the kit lens will  produce good quality pictures. You may need a faster lens to shoot in low light. Overall, this is a great starter setup for someone looking to upgrade to a dslr package.

Title: Darn good puter!
Content:
I have owned this computer for 6 months and it still runs like new. It does just about anything you would normally do. In the ad it never said it had a mic or camera so who ever posted that was refering to a different model. I've had it for six months and I live on it due to my job and home life, and is just like new. What is sad is when I purchased this laptop I had never heard of this company and the computer is exellent, but before I had a Sony Vaio and it didn't last but 6mo.s and BestBuy replaced it with this one due to product malfunction. I have to say somtimes name brands are not all they are cracked up to be. One thing to remember is to get educated about protecting your computer and do what is necessary and you should not have any serious problems. I was very uneducated when I first got a puter and it took me 3 yrs. to understand it so I understand easier said than done, but take the time to protect it it is in the end a machine not alive and cannot fix itself and protect itself without your help.

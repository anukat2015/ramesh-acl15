Title: happy BUT>>>>>>
Content:
happy happy happy happy BUT  I have a hardware problem, the flash lid is not popping up and give an error sign.  So, I sent it to Cannon and they were absolutely wonderful about fixing the problem in a timely manner.  Got my camera back,......same problem. POO POO  I still love my camera. It takes awesome pictures.  I am sure my malfunction is a fluke and I would definitely buy the camera again.

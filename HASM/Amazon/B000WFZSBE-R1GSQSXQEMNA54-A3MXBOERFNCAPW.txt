Title: Good product X Tough software download
Content:
I purchased a Zune not long ago. It's a great product. Easy to use, no hassles with one single exception. The software took forever to download. I mean, over 2 hours over a cable connection. This is the only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating. I hope I don't have to download the software one more time. But again, the product is great. Just the right size, nice controls and awesome screen. Go and get one. You'll love it!!

Title: Great camera!
Content:
I'm not sure what more I can say about the camera that hasn't already been said.  I'm a novice photographer who was looking to move up to a DSLR and get a camera that would allow me to do everything I wanted, but not go overboard on things I didn't need.  I'm continually impressed by the crisp, clear, and color matched photos I get from the camera.  The anti-shake is great and the camera has all the features I could need while providing the ease of use needed for an amateur like myself.

Title: Hoover Bagless Canister
Content:
Nice size and really quiet compared to the old Hoover Dimension canister it replaces. Other pluses - does not emit dust during use; Cleans the heck out of the carpet. I had no idea we were leaving so much dirt and dust in our carpets. Only drawback is small dust container, but the tradeoff is worth the hassle of frequent emptying.

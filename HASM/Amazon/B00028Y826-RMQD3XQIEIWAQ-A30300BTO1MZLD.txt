Title: great little gadget
Content:
I just got this item a couple of days ago and I'm pretty happy with it.  I really wasn't looking for an MP3 player, but I got sucked into the technology.  I'm nowhere near computer literate so it took me a couple of tries to transfer my music files on to the player.  For some reason I just couldn't just drag and drop so I had to use the software to get started, but I started flowing soon after.  The biggest thing I like about it is the size of it.  I can just stick it in my pocket and roll.  I didn't have any problems with the carrier as I've read some folks did.  The price is right if you're not looking at spending a lot of money and a first time buyer of this type of product.  I'm pretty happy with my purchase so far.

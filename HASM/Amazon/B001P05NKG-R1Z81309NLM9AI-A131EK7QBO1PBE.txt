Title: Seen the light
Content:
This is my very first mac - very pleased with everything except the price, but it is worth it.   I got up to speed within a few days and have no problem working with this and three "other brand" systems on the same network.  I will leave the in-depth tech comments to others but I am very impressed with:
- Zero hassle and minimum  set-up time
- Great design and build quality
- Very fast operation with all apps and excellent on-line capabilities
Only disadvantages found so far:
- Limited options to resize and position images directly in email, or change color of mail background - maybe another Mail client out there that would work better for me
- High initial cost
- Miss the page up/down buttons

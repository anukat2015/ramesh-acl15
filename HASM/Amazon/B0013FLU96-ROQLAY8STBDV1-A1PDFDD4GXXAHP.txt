Title: Just not worth all that money
Content:
I used to be a Mac person, and then I converted over to PC. Because of husband pressure and advice from the Geek Squad, I ended up buying this MacBookPro, which I've been using for several weeks.
First off I do not like the silver plastic of this case. It feels cheap, and the computer runs so hot that I have to put a magazine under it to balance it on my lap. It really, really runs hot. I also don't like the old-fashioned matte screen, having been spoiled by my Acer's slick sharp screen. The screen is also smallish--although the diagonal measure is true, the depth of the screen is less than my other computers. 
The model ships with BootCamp, which works great, although you will have to purchase Windows VISTA separately if you're going that way. I have partitioned my hard drive 50/50 Mac/PC and am experiencing no problems. I use the machine as a PC except for iPod and photos. Apple also provided decent in-computer speakers, thank heavens, so you can play videos without using supplementary speakers. 
The keyboard is backlit in low light settings (you can turn this feature off). This is rather nice, but it doesn't make up for the touch of the keyboard, which doesn't feel all that great to me. 
Now is this machine were 1/2 the price, things would be different. But at this price point, I really am looking for something that is a bit more perfect.

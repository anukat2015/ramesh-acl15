Title: A Great Desktop or Laptop Replacement
Content:
This is a fantastic computer.  It is fast, uncomplicated, and stable.  It starts up quickly and has enough power( 2GB Ram)for programs to run in the background without you noticing it.  The layout is easy to get used to and has some great features like a remote to operate music and videos from across the room, quickplay controls above the keyboard for quick volume control and other dvd or cd operations, and a wireless switch which allows you to go from wired to wireless instantly.  HP's support is fantastic.  I sent in an email question about using the built in fax modem and got an answer within hours. I also was provided with a contact name and access to fast follow up help.  HP's online classes are free and very informative.

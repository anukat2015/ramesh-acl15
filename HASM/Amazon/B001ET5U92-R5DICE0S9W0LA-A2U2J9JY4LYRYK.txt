Title: Love It! Love It! Love It!
Content:
I am not a professional, but I do enjoy taking good photo's and sharing them with my family and friends.  I have a grandchild and many reasons and opportunities to record his activities.  After hearing and reading a great deal about this camera, I made the choice over a similar Canon.  I have always been a Canon fan, but decided if I was going to make a long range investment of lenses I needed to do a lot of research and make a long term commitment.  I love my choice.  This camera has been everything the camera shop experts explained to me and everything I could imagine.  The quality and ease of use has been excellent.  I really feel I know what I am doing when I use this equipment.  I can only say if you are ready to purchase a digital SLR or update to a semi-professional unit this  camera will please you in every way.  I highly recommend.

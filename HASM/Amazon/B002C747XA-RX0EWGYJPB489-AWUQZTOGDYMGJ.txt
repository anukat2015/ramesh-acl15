Title: Worth the wait
Content:
After humming and ha-ing about this purchase, to replace my 17" macbook pro, I finally bit the bullet and am delighted with the results. The start up time is stunning, the graphics, keyboard etc are wonderful. The only drawback I have found is the USB slot. If you have a usb device which has large "shoulders" you will need an adapter. I don't miss the dvd drive, I can simply hook it up to my macbook pro and install from there. It's light and sexy, you know you want one ;)

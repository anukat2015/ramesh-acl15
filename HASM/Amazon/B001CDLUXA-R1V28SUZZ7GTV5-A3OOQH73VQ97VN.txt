Title: No doubt the SOUND OF PERFECTION
Content:
I have no doubt that it is the sound of perfection, the greatest sounding MP3 player ever. I own the original Zen and find that the quality is great but as I got Soundblaster extremegamer x-fi, I know there is room for improvement. I hope to see the Zen with built-in speaker and here it is! I hope to see X-fi integrated to Zen and here it is! I hope to get longer battery life and here it is! I hope to get 32GB at greatest value prices (bundle with high quality earbuds EP-830) and here it is! When I bought this (from Creative in Singapore at S$399 the day it was released) and load my songs in, with X-fi crystalizer ON, X-fi expand ON (some people don't like surround, so you can off it), paired with EP-830, the music is even better, louder, ups and downs better, better bass without distortion, the best that you can get so far. The wireless streaming feature and instant messaging (wifi) is a plus but I have yet to seriously use them. There is no internet browser. The 9 button is comfortable to press and improves navigation over the original Zen. It is slightly thicker than Zen, but it looks and feels more high class due to the sliver backing and chrome edge and the slightly heavier mass. Overall, it is a great improvement over the original Zen and offers better value and full package for sound of perfection (EP-830 with X-fi and Zen quality). You can also buy a docking station with built-in rechargeable battery (not yet available) that also charges Zen X-fi. Will update once I got more results on wireless features.

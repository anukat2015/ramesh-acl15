Title: Infrared Heater
Content:
I'm going to be very happy I bought this for the winter.  Heaven only knows what heating prices will be and in the area I live in ATMOS gas is high!!! At least now I can shut myself up in one room and get some sleep...the rest of the time I will put on layers of clothes.  Living on SS is hard and anything that helps save any money is welcome.  I haven't had to use it yet but am confident it will help me...I couldn't afford the $300 - $400 systems being sold and as we know, older people "make do" so I give thanks I bought this before the winter.

Title: Overflow mess
Content:
I don't know what the deal is with this one.  I've had it less than a week and it's made a mess 3 different times.  I don't know what my husband did exactly the first time, I think I may have put in a little too much water the 2nd time (though I used the carafe to fill the water resevior, so I don't know), and the last time I was super careful to try and avoid it.  My mom said to me "if two intelligent people can't stop a coffee pot from leaking either it is a manufacturing problem or the darn thing is broken!"  I'll be returning it for something else.
I will say that I don't have any issues with the carafe keeping the coffee hot, and I didn't pre-heat it.  I used the program feature and set up the coffee the night before to brew in the morning.

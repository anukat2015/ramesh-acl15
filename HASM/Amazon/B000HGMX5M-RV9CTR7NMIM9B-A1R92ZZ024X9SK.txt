Title: major unreported issue
Content:
Great camera except that it has a tendency to lock up and not record the pictures taken. Tried multiple different memory cards with the same result. Finally tried to upgrade the firmware with the result that the camera completely died and is now useless. As my warranty has expired it will probably cost me several hundred dollars to get fixed. In contacting Nikon the refused to even reply with a solution as my residence was listed as others. In short avoid Nikon if you ever expect to need support as their main concern will be to turn you away to avoid responsibility.

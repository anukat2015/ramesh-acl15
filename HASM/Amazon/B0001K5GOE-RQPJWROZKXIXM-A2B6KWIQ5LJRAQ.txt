Title: Quite disappointing
Content:
The Dyson is lightweight, quiet, the bagless feature is convenient, and it is very cute looking BUT for the price it should perform far better than it does.  So far, my irritations and disappointments have been as follows:
1/ The button to switch from carpet to solid floor gets easily bumped where it is located and requires manual resetting or turning the machine off and back on to reset it.
2/ The brush attachment is far too stiff and sparse to be of any use.
3/ The power cord is too short and requires the use of an extension cord or frequent plugging and unplugging to move the vacuum cleaner about the house.
4/ The floor attachment "flings" away items that are not small.
5/ The hose is too cumbersome, not flexible enough, to work with when using the attachments.
6/ The telescoping wand collapses at will and requires frequent manual extension and re-locking into position.
7/ It does not provide strong enough suction for the carpet, it picks up most, but not all.
I'm sure as soon as I vacuum up when I get off line, I will note other shortcomings.  
The bottom line is that the price is far too high for the low performance it provides.

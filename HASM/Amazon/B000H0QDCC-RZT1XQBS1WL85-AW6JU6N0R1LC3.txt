Title: Definitely Beats The IPOD!
Content:
The Zune is definitely better than an IPOD! I purchased a pink Zune and I am very happy with the product. My brother has a red Zune and he is also very happy with it. He cant live without it. His Zune goes everywhere with him! I'm also thinking about buying a white Zune for my sister for her birthday. I think the Ipod is overrated. Trust me, the Zune is way better! It lets you share music, see the album cover,---it lets you do so many things...Oh, and another one of my favorite things is that it has a radio. I love that! The only thing I wish was that there were more colors to choose from, but apart from that, the Zune definitely is the best choice! Buy it! I promise you wont regret it!!!

Title: 32GB iPod Touch
Content:
This is my 10 year old son's iPod. He researched it and bought it with his Amazon gift cards that he has been hoarding for close to a year. This is his 3rd portable gaming system (Nintendo Gameboy and Sony PSP being the others) and he is quite thrilled with it. He's been on spring break the last 3 weeks and I don't think the thing has been out of his hands any longer than the time necessary to charge it. It kept him fully occupied on a flight from L.A. to D.C., playing games and watching movies. Very easy to sync, very durable. He's dropped it several times with no adverse effects. Highly recommend this product.

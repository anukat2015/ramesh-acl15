Title: Problem with ADD WATER light; Keurig Customer Service Just OK
Content:
I received my Keurig Elite B40 brewer last week.  After filling the water reservoir to maximum according to directions before using the brewer for the first time, I tried to empty the water reservoir by repeating the brewing cycle.  When the water level got down to 12 ounces, the ADD WATER light came on and the brewer stopped working. I tried several other times over the next two days to use the brewer and each time when the water level got down to 12 ounces, it would stop working.  I called Keurig Customer Service the Friday after Thanksgiving to explain my problem. The Customer Service Rep said I had to speak with Tech Support, but unfortunately, Tech Support was not in and I was told to call back Monday between the hours of 8:30 and 5:30.  Inconvenient for me because I work during the week.  I read on Keurig's website that Customer Service could provide a Return Authorization Code.  When I called a second time Friday and asked for a Return Authorization code, the Customer Service Rep said she didn't have the authority to issue one and to call Tech Support. I called today (Sunday) for the third time and explained my problem to the Customer Service Rep.  The Rep told me to turn off the brewer and turn it back on again.  The ADD WATER light still remained on.  Needless to say, I'm disappointed with Keurig's customer service.  I plan to call Monday morning, get a return authorization, and return the brewer.

Title: Fine Device...But
Content:
I bought my Zune to replace a 2gb Nano which served me faithfully until it got lost.  So thought would try a Zune since was about same form factor as Nano and I needed new cables anyway.  I liked the screen and was happy with the fact I had an FM radio which is great for the gym.  I found the touch function too sensitive so turned it off and also was happy to see I could disable the wi-fi since I did not use it.  Battery life was pretty good too.  It was a chore porting my music to the Zune from iTunes but I figured lets start getting rid of the DRM now.  OK done, Zune software although different works good enough ( not very stylish but functional ).
SO Zune works for 9 months then stops. OK send for repair. Free under warranty
It takes quite a while to repair and finally they send me a new one.
This works for 2 months and stops again.  
I called and found they only honor the original warranty which expired about 2 weeks ago and they want $70.00 to fix it.  NOPE -  I am going back to Apple or trying something else. Did by a Sansa, but it is not very stable.
Sad to say as much as I did like the ZUNE I need a product that is more reliable.
hmmmm  same with my Xbox360, wonder if they made by same people? 
Anyway maybe the next generation Zune will be better, but I do not think I will take the chance...unless they are giving them away.

Title: Dirt shooter
Content:
I laughed when I read another reviewer express sympathy for the person who collected the Uno when he threw it out onto the street.
It was probably me!  For a $0 vacuum it isn't bad.  The HEPA is certainly vast improvement upon our last, non-HEPA vacuum.  And I'm quite pleased with the fact that I have to empty the dust bin so frequently.  Better in the trash than my floor.
However, I caution against using the Uno with bare feet.  One would be forgiven for believing a small army of ants was assaulting your shins and ankles with a barrage of rocket-propelled detritus.  No matter how many trips about the room I made, a fine layer of unsuctionable grit remained.  I have no doubt that each particle was spotless.

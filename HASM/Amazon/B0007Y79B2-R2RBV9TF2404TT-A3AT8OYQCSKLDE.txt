Title: Bring back the mini!
Content:
This is a delicate product.  It's all scratched up after only a week of use.  They may be superficial, but lets face it, we're paying a big premium because this thing LOOKS GOOD.  It should look good for more than a freaking week!  Also the battery seems to take forever to charge, which is surprising.  I hear that the new Sony mini players are a better bet.  
Update: Filled up after 811 songs.  So much for holding 1000.

Title: Nice coffee pot
Content:
I bought this one to replace another Capresso.  (Nothing wrong with it, 5 yrs old--just time for a change).  The controls are basically the same, easy to set the clock, etc.  Out of the box and ready to go in 5 min.
This carafe is larger than my old thermal carafe (10 cups now compared to 8 cups before).  I haven't had any problem with the way the carafe fills, etc.  Just add coffee, water and go.  I really like the carafe because it's relatively "undrippable".  After I pour a cup of coffee, there's no "drip" hanging from the spout.  
It's a great design, looks good on the counter, and brews a nice cup of coffee.  I like the portability of the carafe and it keeps the coffee hot.  
Was also able to buy on Amazon with a $30 off houseware coupon, so got it at a great price as well.

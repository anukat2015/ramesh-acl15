Title: Best I have owned
Content:
Great capacity, no spill pouring, distributes water over grounds instead of one straight stream, easy access to removable filter canister, almost no water lost to evaporation durring brewing.
The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because I want the auto cutoff to wait an extra hour or two before it shuts off.

Title: Heater does the job
Content:
I bought this heater for my daughter's large, cold bedroom above the garage. She has the timer set to come on when she gets home from work at 5pm, and go off at 8am when she leaves. It works perfectly, and provides an even warmth. My daughter gets cold very easy and says that she keeps this heater on the lowest setting. We've only had this a short time, but so far, very happy.

Title: Vacuum with Attitude
Content:
I purchased this vacumm, complete with power brush unit, about two and half months ago, and it is by far one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. This vacuum has attitude, period! It's powerful, two speed motor allows flexibility no matter if you need to clean floors and carpets or upholstery and drapes. The stainless steel canister is very sleek and all the trim and accessories with it are quality. For the power that it renders, it is not at all overly noisy and the dogs don't seem to go into attack mode as soon as I turn it on.  Having multiple pets, I am particularly pleased at how pet hair is no obstacle for this vacuum. Be aware though that this is not your typical vacumm by "design." There are two things you may find to be a awkward. One, there is no retractable power cord feature on the unit so you must hand wind it yourself and hang the cord up on a hook in the closet or where ever you store your vacumm. There is also no on-board storage for the accessories. Second, the vacuum bag is rather small. So if you are doing a full once over of say a 2,500 square foot home, you may have to empty the bag by the end of that cleaning cycle, especially if you have pet hair to contend with. The good news is that the bags are readily available and reasonably priced. I have already dealt with the company in New York who manufactures the vacuum and they were both helpful and timely in sending me a large quantity of bags. Overall, I expect to have a very long and harmonious relationship with "Sylvia," as it has been named in our family.

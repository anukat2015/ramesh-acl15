I do like this coffee maker alot. I have been a multiple Krups owner. The last coffee maker I owned was a DeLonghi which was bought at Target. It had more options and was less money. I don't think it lasted even a year before it started to turn off before the pot of coffee was done brewing, or would not turn itself off after 2 hours. I wanted to buy The DCM900 before I had bought the one from Target but could not get myself to spent the extra dough to get it. The one from Target was 50$ and became a fire hazard I thought. So after looking back at the DCM900 on Amazon I found one in my price range. Yeah it is alot of money for a coffee maker that is not loaded with tons of options, but the style and performance are great. It is kind of kool when people come by and they say wow nice coffee maker. No I can't program it to make my coffee before I wake up, and it does not grind my beans for me, but how many people are willing to to say to themselves am I crazy for paying that much for a coffee maker and do it?

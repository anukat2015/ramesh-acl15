Content:
Someone broke into my house and swiped my two netbooks.  I took the insurance money and bought this Acer.  What a great computer.  It is lite weight, fast and smooth.  It is very intuitive to run.  Instruction book and technical support did not know that the button to turn on the wireless is under the wireless light on the lower left side but other than that I haven't had a problem.  I purchased this because I wanted the 4G for photography.  I am very pleased.

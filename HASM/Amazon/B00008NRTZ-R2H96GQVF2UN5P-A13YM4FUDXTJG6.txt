Title: We are experiencing MAJOR repair issues on this vacuum..
Content:
The Bissell Digipro Canister (manufactered by Samsung of Korea) has numerous repair problems.  We are starting to see these machines in for repair, more and more frequently.  The main issues are with the electrical hose, electrical wands, and the circuit boards.  We tend to see this happen on Korean made vacuums, the circuit boards seem to overheat, and a lot of them even melt!   Samsung has made this machine under their label, and the Bissell model seems to have the same, if not more problems!  Dont expect to get any more then 3 years without some kind of electrical problem.  
One way you can prevent problems with the hose is, instead of pulling the canister around with the hose, simply go back to the canister, and push it with your foot.  This will avoid stress on the hose, and prevent the hose from breaking.   
One other common problem that can be avoided is by picking up all big items off the floor first.  This may seem like common sense, but the Bissell DigiPro has a very small opening in the powernozzle.  This causes larger pieces to become stuck, not allowing the vacuum to pick up.
Not a great vacuum in terms of quality.

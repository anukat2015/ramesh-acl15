Title: almost perfect
Content:
a very short review because I don't speak english: this camera is almost perfect for a non professional user (like me) and deserves a better lens, you have to buy separately of course. the only strange behavior I have encountered is that sometimes it needs a "reboot", but speaking of an electronic device it's not surprising at all; also, it's impossible to change all the parameters in full manual operation with your eye on the viewfinder.

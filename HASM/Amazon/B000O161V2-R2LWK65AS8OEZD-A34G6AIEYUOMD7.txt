Title: Fantastic Camera
Content:
If I could rate this camera using 10 stars, I would.  This is absolutely the best digital camera I could ever hope to own.  I have had it for only one month, but have taken pictures of flowers, animals, people and collectibles. I am so amazed at the details of each picture when I view it on my computer screen.  There is so much more for me to learn about the Nikon D40x features, and I am certain that it will provide me with even more breath-taking photos as I become familiar with those features.

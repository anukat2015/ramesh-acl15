Title: Outstanding camera; great value
Content:
I bought this camera when it came out & have been very impressed with the quality of my photos.  It inevitably gives me clear, crisp images with little work on my part; most of what I have shot with this has been set on Auto.  My mother also has this camera and she uses only the kit lens to take outstanding portraits.  The kit lens has gotten a bad reputation but I recently compared shots with it to one of my L lens and was somewhat surprised to see the photos are very nice even with the comparison.  I have found colors to be quite good and the lens produces nice sharp images.  I suspect there is quite a variation in the lens quality due to mass production.  Overall I would have to rate this 5 stars and consider it an outstanding value for the money.

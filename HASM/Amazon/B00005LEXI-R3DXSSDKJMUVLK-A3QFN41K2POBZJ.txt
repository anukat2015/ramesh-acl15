Title: Not worth the trouble
Content:
I thought this would be a great heater for use in a spare room with no heat. The ad says you can use it inside and it used propane which burns clean. The small print says you need to leave a window or door open. It stinks of fumes and suckes up a single tank very fast. The heat does not radiate out but rather goes straight up. Not very useful anywhere. I returned it.

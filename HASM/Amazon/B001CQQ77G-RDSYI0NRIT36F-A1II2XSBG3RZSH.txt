Title: Great Ambience
Content:
I was looking for a good heater and appearance and found both with this product.  I use it in my mobile home and it looks great, especially with the lites out.  Very Realistic.  The heat is fine, like all the new heaters, it's not too hot or dry.  It's metal, easy to change the bulb and efficient.

Title: Inferior
Content:
We have this coffee pot at work, and it seems really great-- if you don't touch it. 
It looks nice and has an insulated pot to keep the coffee warm for a very long time. This is great and all, But every time I make coffee it leaks out the back as it's brewing, and it's hard to pour the water into the top.  I have since stopped brewing, and left that up to other people, and just stuck to drinking. It makes a decently fast pot. but when I go to pour, it drips on the counter EVERY TIME (and no, it's not just me, the whole office talks about this). And to get the coffee to come out you have to turn the pot almost upside-down, and it still comes out really slow, even when there is a full pot. The pour spout is just WAY too small. The pot is also pretty heavy and a solid color, so you can't see or feel how much is left without opening the top.
My $10 coffee pot at home has treated me much better than this one, I do not recommend it. If you're going to spend the money, get a nice one.

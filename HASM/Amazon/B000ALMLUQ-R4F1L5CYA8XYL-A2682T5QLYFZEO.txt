Title: Easy to Use
Content:
It's very easy to use and clean -- don't really have to clean it...
My girlfriend just LOVES it.
It makes good coffee and the sound, while a little noisy, is not an issue for me as it brews fast.
Would prefer to be able to buy packets from a store when running low but other than that, it's very good.
Oh, and by the way.  HAPPY ST. PADDY'S DAY!

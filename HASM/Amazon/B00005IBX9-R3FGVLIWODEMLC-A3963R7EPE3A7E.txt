Title: Really Good Coffee over and over again
Content:
We have worn out three of these fantastic coffee makers.  Normally, we will drink about 5 pots of coffee a day and this pot has not let us down one time.  It takes about 1 minute per cup which is just enough time in the morning to let the dogs out and by the time they return it is ready for the first batch.  We find the filling a bit of a chore.  In the beginning getting the right amount of water in the little chute was a tad awkward but now we are used to it.  The gold filter works well as does the #4 paper filters.  The #4s have doubled in price since we began using this pot.  The internal water filter does a good job at eliminating any taste that may appear in the water.  You do have to replace it at least once every 6 months depending on your water.  Our water comes out of a creek by some circular route and is quite clean while a friend's comes out of the city's sewer system and is a tad different.  All of that adds up to this pot making a fine pot of coffee and it does so consistently.  
We have been so happy with this one we have decided to go for the DCC-2600 which has the same features except it is 14 cup versus 12, and there is an external window to see the fill level along with a better chute arrangement according to the advertisement.  We'll see.  
Bottom line:  Would I buy this again?  In a heart beat.

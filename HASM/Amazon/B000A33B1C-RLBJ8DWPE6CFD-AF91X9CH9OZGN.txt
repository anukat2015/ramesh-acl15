Title: Good little heater at a very good price
Content:
I've purchased two of these, the first about eighteen months ago to heat an unheated - and not particularly well insulated - home office. The area is about 20X15 ft., and the TRD0715T has worked brilliantly. In truth, we don't even notice it, the ambient temperature is so consistently comfortable. 
The second I purchased a couple of weeks ago, and now I'm truly impressed. My son recently acquired a two-story townhouse, not overly big - about 1000 SF and a very "open" floorplan - but still a good deal more than our home office. It's a "fixer-upper" and one of the things that needs "fixing" is the gas furnace. I thought a TRD0715T would at least take the edge off the cold until the furnace was repaired. 
The TRD0715T has performed beautifully. He keeps the unit at the foot of the stairs and both the first and second floors are at an even, comfortable temperature. In fact, it's working so well that my son has decided to wait until he can afford to get the furnace replaced rather than simply repaired, which would be best.
The only reason I don't give it five stars is that, for a lazy person like me, the automatic settings could be simplified and I wish it had handholds on both ends, not just one. My son finds neither of these things a problem.

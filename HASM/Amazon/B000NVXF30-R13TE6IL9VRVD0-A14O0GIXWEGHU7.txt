Title: Great camera for an excellent price
Content:
I did a lot of research before buying the Oly E510. Before I was using a canon S2 which is a great camera too, but wanted to upgrade to a DSLR. I am not an expert in photography, but so far I got incredible pics with this camera. I've tried all auto mode and also manual. Not seen any problem so far. I followed some advices given in www.wrotniak.net that I strong recommend you to read if you are thinking of buying this camera. The E510 is very light, very comfortable to handle and very easy to learn how to use.  Couldn't have made a better choice.

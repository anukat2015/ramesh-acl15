Title: Great for what it has
Content:
I have had my Ipod touch for about a month now and I am very satisfied. It is really cool in the fact that everything is done through your touch and is very enjoyable.
PROS:
1. Music, Video, and Photo work great and are really cool.
2. Graphics are great.
3. Internet works great with the Wi-fi
CONS:
1. While everything it has works great, it doesn't have much more than that. The thing is there isn't much more. I would expect some accessories or stuff to do while I'm playing my music but without access to the internet there isn't much to do. There are no games to install. One could jailbreak the ipod but that's very risky. 
2. While it does have link to itunes, but you can't download like podcasts or any free music onto your ipod. You to listen to music from other websites and there is no way to download. 
3. It ain't cheap. 
If you have the money and you would like a flashy iPod have fun!

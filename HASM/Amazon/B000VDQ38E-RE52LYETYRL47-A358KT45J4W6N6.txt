Title: This one is a good vacuum cleaner!
Content:
This vacuum has been built right, and is well thought out.  It is effective in cleaning dog hair, which is something I couldn't say for my past two vacuums, both of which were 2x the cost of the vacuum.  I've been using it for about 6 weeks now and am enjoying a good product for the money.

Title: Decent camera ...could have added few more features!
Content:
I think they could have included few more features like live view and Video recording...Compared to canon XSi which comes in the same range, Nikon would have been able to manage these requirements. Overall a very tough and easy to use camera, specially for beginners like me!!

Title: dissatified ComfortZone purchaser
Content:
purchased heater in the spring.  Tried it once and appeared to be OK.  Now that cool weather is here, I tried it again and the unit does not work.  Unable to find manufacturer on internet to find out where to have it repaired.  Unable to find the company or any information about the unit.  As I do not recall where I purchased the unit, no where to go to find out about service or warranty.

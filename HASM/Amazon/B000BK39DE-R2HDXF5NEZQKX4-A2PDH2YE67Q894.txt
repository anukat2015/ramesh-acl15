Title: A great way to enter DSLR photography
Content:
The quality of the eight megapixel images are excellent, particularly if you focus manually. Using auto-focus doesn't appear to yield quite such good results. The Olympus E-500 isn't altogether an easy camera to use - on the other hand, a thorough reading of the user manual means it's not exactly difficult to learn either. As you'd expect with an SLR, the viewfinder is really accurate and clear, and the screen very good too. The shutter delay is an impressive 16 hundredths of a second - so you have a good chance of capturing the moment you want. You also get lots of options to control the way your photos look. Although it's still the best part of a kilogram in weight, the E-500 together with the 14-45mm lens is a bit lighter than some of the other digital SLRs I looked at, and slightly more portable as a result. The battery life is superb, and the flash is strong. It also has an anti-dust feature, which is a definite advantage.
Overall - this two lens package delivers excellent value for money.

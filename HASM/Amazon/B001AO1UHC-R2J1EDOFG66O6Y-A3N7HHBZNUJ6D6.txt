Title: Your basic portable air conditioner
Content:
I want to give the device 3.5 stars, but I cannot so I'll give it 3 stars for being average.  I have owned this device for 9 months now, and have used it for probably 2, and just started using it again this year.  I'm not really sure how effective it is compared to other portable machines, but it does make a great cooling fan, and it cools a small room well.  The main reason I bought it to help me stay cool when I do my elliptical machine workout, and on that front, it works perfectly.  The backlit display is nice, and the machine is probably "average" for noise level.  The hoses are good quality, flexible and you can put the hoses vertically or horizontally which is really nice, and while I haven't really used it, the remote control with an LCD is a plus.  The coasters on the unit make it pretty easy to move around, and it feels very solid in build quality.
I'm not sure how long the unit will last, but if I get at least 4 years of use out of it (I paid about $400), that's roughly $100 per year and I'd give the device 4 stars at that point.  From others I have spoken to, you can expect to get 5 years usage, tops out of most portable air conditioners.
No complaints so far...

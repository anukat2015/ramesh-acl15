Title: Incredible product
Content:
I've had my Carbon for about two weeks now, and I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase. First off, kudos to Rio for the sleek design; it's amazingly small and light, travels very well, and looks very, very stylish. 
There are minor annoyances associated with the Carbon though. First off, if you buy this, make sure to have a set of good headphones / earbuds of your own with a gold plated plug. The packaged earbuds are crap, and anything uncoated apparently produces a lot of static due to some design error. Secondly, the back of the Carbon and the touchpad collect fingerprints like mad; being the neat freak that I am, I spend quite a lot of time polishing the bugger (annoying!).
Beyond these small grievances of mine, the Carbon trumps the iPod in both storage / battery life. Beyond the obvious 1gb increase, I'm never concerned about the remaining battery power (although I haven't tested the claim of 20 hours, I've never ran out of power, and I use this thing all the time). If you do buy the Carbon, make sure to upgrade the firmware; lots of small fixes and charging while connected via USB = plus.

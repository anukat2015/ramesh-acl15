I love my new camera, and am snapping so many more pictures than I did with my old Canon film SLR, which was too heavy to carry around with me.
All the hype about the camera being difficult to hold without the battery pack just isn't true, unless maybe ]you're a guy with big hands.  My hands are far from tiny, and the camera is perfectly comfy to hold.
I am very happy with the quality of the pictures, even in "point 'n shoot" modes.

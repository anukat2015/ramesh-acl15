Title: Great all around, especially HDMI output to 1080p TV
Content:
This is my favorite laptop computer since I owned my first one 10 years ago.  I have had IBM, Acer, HP, and others.  This one has met all my expectations and some at a great price.
The CPU that comes with this unit is the "base" T4300 with the Intel 4500M video card. Before I got the unit I was a little concerned that the system might not have enough horse power to run certain applications. After using it for 2 months, I have been so pleasantly surprised and impressed.  I shoot a lot of photos in RAW and use Photoshop CS4 extensively.  This laptop is more than able to handle multiple layers in large photo files.  
One of the uses of my laptop is streaming online movies to my 52" Sony LCD TV.  Even though the laptop display resolution is only 1366x768, as soon as HDMI cable is connected to the TV the laptop screen will go dark and the display automatically switches to the native TV resolution, which is 1080p. Boy, everything looks so great on such a big screen.  Streaming video looks quite acceptable to me if you ask.
The quality of the laptop is pretty good too. I like that the heat fan is whisper quiet.  It's a great purchase!!

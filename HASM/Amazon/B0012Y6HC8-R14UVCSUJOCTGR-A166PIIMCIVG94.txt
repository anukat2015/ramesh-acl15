Title: More camera for your money!
Content:
My wife and I decided to replace our Nikon Coolpix 8700. I've had several different cameras over the years (digital point-and-shoots, SLRs, and finally the Coolpix 8700), I wanted to stick with a Nikon D-SLR, however after looking at prices vs. features, it became clear you get more camera per buck on Canon D-SLRs than you would with Nikons (we would've gone for a Nikon D-90 for something comparable to the Rebel XSi, and at the time of the purchase, it would've been $200-300 more).
It's been over a month and close to a thousand shots now since we purchased the Rebel XSi, and I couldn't be happier with the camera. The XSi menu interface is very intuitive. Add a nice flash to your setup, and you'll be able to produce professional-looking shots in just about any occasion. What I'm most impressed by is the battery life in this camera: during our church's vacation Bible school week, I took an average of 400 shots daily, both in and outdoors. At the end of the day, the battery indicator still showed a full charge! Recharging the battery also only took about 20-30 minutes! This is a great improvement as far as one of the biggest annoyances I've had over the years with digital cameras. 
For the budget buyers out there, I was fortunate to find an XSi in used, mint condition from a reputable seller. It saved me several hundred dollars.

Title: Piece of Junk
Content:
Applemanics will be very upset about it, but this is a piece of junk.
I have bought my iPod to run with it, however, in the first run the controls (in the headset) got lost. The moisture caused the headset to stop working. After that, it kept reading the song name, passing to the next song and so forth...
I went through several forums and saw many people complaining about it, the headset is junk.
I have tried to run with it couple of times and it is just useless when you start to sweat, sometimes the sound volumes increases by itself, sometimes decreases...
Do yourself a favor and by another brand. 
Forget about it.

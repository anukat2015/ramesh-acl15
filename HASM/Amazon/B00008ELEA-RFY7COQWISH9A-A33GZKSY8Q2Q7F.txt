Title: Best little percolator
Content:
After using drip makers for years (and experiencing them leaking, not making good tasting coffee, made cheaply, breaking), I tried this percolator. My mom and aunts and grandma always used farberware percolators. They are made well, clean easily, last long, look nice, and make a great cup of coffee. I will never go back to a drip.

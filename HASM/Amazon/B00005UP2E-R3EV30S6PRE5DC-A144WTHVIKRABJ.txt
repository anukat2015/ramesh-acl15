Title: dirt devil vaccume
Content:
This is the best value for my money.  I use to drive over three hours to a store to buy this vacuume, then I saw an add for Amazon and searched and found my favorite item.  How easy it was to click, buy at a cheaper price and it was delivered within a couple days to my door.  Thus, saved me the round trip of gas, time and haggle of shopping and this great item was as my door.
I thank Amazon for the easy shopping process and quick contact with customer service when I had a question and extremely helpfull.  Plus, I thank Dirt devil for the easy use of this vacuume, it has easy attach ments, quick cleaning canister and to honestly tell you I use it daily since I have my own residential cleaning company, these motors are put to extreme use that one has never ever died on me yet, when I feel I have beat them up, I sell them at my garage sale and they are gone within seconds of opening my sale.  So I get a few dollars back on an item that has served me the entire year making money. If I can rave about an item this is it folks, I can only find this item on line and one store too far for me to travel these days.  You should buy one in the event the company chooses to not make it as companies change models year to year.  In my case I hope it becomes readily available year after year or I am back to a broom.

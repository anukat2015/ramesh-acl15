Title: Moving up in Quality
Content:
Recently purchased this camera after using a cannon SD500 for 3-4 years, basically as a point and shoot. The 40D can also be used as a point and shoot but you wouldn't want to purchase this camera for that purpose. It has a lot of features and moving from point and shoot to this camera means a steep learning curve for the uninitiated. I am still learning about it and taking a class in digital photography.  This is a great camera and is high value for the money.  Be prepared, it is a little heavier than the Nikon D80 which I considered.

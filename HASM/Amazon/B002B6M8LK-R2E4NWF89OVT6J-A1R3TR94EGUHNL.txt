Title: DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!
Content:
I was really excited to receive this but I knew I wouldn't like it right when I opened it. I thought one of the other reviewers was joking when they said it was the size of a credit card. They were not lying. It's so small that when you touch it to navigate around it doesn't even recognize where you are trying to go. The scroll bar with music doesn't help either. I tried to go through all the music I put on it and it was so frustrating. I had to get the stylus from my DSi to try to scroll it, and it didn't even budge it. Do not waste your time with this unless you don't mind the headaches from it. I really didn't want to pay $100-$200 more for a Zune or an Apple Ipod, but after having this, it's well worth having to pay more.

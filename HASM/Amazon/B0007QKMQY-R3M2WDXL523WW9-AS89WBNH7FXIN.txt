Title: My first SLR
Content:
And wow, what a difference it is from point-and-shoot cameras.  We were looking for an SLR to take good in-motion pictures.  With our point-and-shoots, they came out terrible, and with kids, they never hold still!  After reading many reviews, both here and cnet, we decided to purchase the XT.  And we're not disappointed one bit!  We're both very much amateurs when it comes to photography, but the manual was easy enough for us to understand how to take pictures OTHER than just on auto.  We love being able to take 10+ shots in a row.  And this does a wonderful job of freezing the action.  Pictures are no longer blurry.  We're very pleased.  And for the price (we found it brand new on ebay for under $500 with the kit lens), it can't be beat.

Title: FIRE HAZARD
Content:
Thought this coffeemaker worked great and looked great until it caught on fire mid-brew.  It was used 5 days a week at my office for approximately 3 months before smoke started billowing out of the top.  Fortunately we were nearby and were able to unplug it and remove it from the building.  The smell of burning electrical components took about 3 hours to go away.  We contacted Cuisinart and they wanted us to pay to ship it back to them and send $10 to cover postage for them to send a replacement. No thanks, I'd rather not risk burning the building down again.  I'm glad we didn't set the coffeemaker to start brewing automatically or things could have been much worse.

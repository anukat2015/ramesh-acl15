Title: My Favorite Laptop I've Owned, And I've Owned Quite A Few
Content:
I have very complaints at all which makes for a boring review I guess. Previously I have owned HP nonebooks one which I still use and in comparison it runs too hot and the fan is contstantly on and noisy. This Toshiba is quiet, and while it can get warm it's one of the coolest I've owned. I've also had Apple laptops which were also too hot. The screen on this is bright and clear. It has nice miniature speakers by harman/kardon on each side of the notebook. The computer runs fast using Photoshop and for general web browsing. The wireless works great with my wireless Buffalo router. Really, it's all good! My only nitpick are the buttons below the touchpad which are too firm and require a stronger amount of force to push down than any previous laptop I've owned. There's also a horizontal light strip above the touchpad which I havent' found a way to turn off. Those are my only complaints. This is a great laptop and I will definitely buy another Toshiba notebook in the future.

Title: New 5d Mark II camera canon
Content:
LOVE THIS CAMERA.  IS EVERYTHING I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND MUCH MORE.  MY IMAGES ARE SPECTACULAR EVERYWHERE I GO, AND IT IS SO EASY AFTER HAVING MY "BEGINNING TRAINING" IN A CANON REBEL XTI WHICH I GOT  YEARS AGO.  4105 LENS IS AWESOME.  
AND IT CAME TO MY DOOR IN LITTLE TOWN MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN 21 HOURS AFTER I ORDERED IT.   IF YOU DO ORDER A CAMERA FROM AMAZON AND THEY GIVE YOU A LIST OF ACCESSORIES, BE CERTAIN THEY FIT THE SIZE OF YOUR LENS.  I BOUGHT A LENS THAT WAS OE THE LIST AND IT WAS WRONG SIZE DUE TO MY IGNORANCE AND SPPED OF ORDERING.  I HAD ORDERED A 7 D FROM ANOTHER CAMERA DISTRIBUTOR AND SENT IT BACK AFTER 2 DAYS. AND ORDERED THIS ONE FROM AMAZON BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SPEEDY AND I HAD TO LEAVE ON TRIP IN TWO DAYS.
SO HAD GREAT PHOTO TRIP OVER 2400 PHOTOS IN 3 WEEKS EVEN WITHOUT MY UV FILTER.

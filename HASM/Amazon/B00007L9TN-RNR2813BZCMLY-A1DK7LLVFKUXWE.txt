Title: Two Thumbs Up!
Content:
I have an office in a 10' x 16' enclosed porch in the Chicago area (it gets very cold here). I had a little 1500 Watt ceramic heater that wasn't keeping the space warm. I got the Patton and it works very well. I heats the entire room with the fan, but also heats the person in front of it directly with radiant heat from the IR lamps.  On the coldest days (wind chill below zero) it can not get the office up to 70 degrees, however I am comfortable because I put the heater about 2-3 feet away from me and the IR heat warms me up, like sitting in front of the fireplace. The only problem I have is that my old dog also likes to lay in front of the heater, and sometimes see gets too close.

Title: Best MP3 Player By Far
Content:
I was holding out on purchasing an apple iPod photo. I didn't want to give into the hype, i was waiting for the perfect mp3 player, but the bottom line is that there is none. I was either going to purchase this or a creative zen touch 40gb. I opted to go with the iPod photo. I'm not a supporter of mac whatsoever, but the iPod impressed me. 30gb is more than ample room for those musid hoarders like myself. Apple says 30 gb of music but 5gb itself is taken up already, due to the awesome programs such as games, contacts, calendars, etc. that apple pre-installed. I'll give my pros and cons below, but overall this is an awesome product, no mp3 player out there is a match. DON'T PURCHASE creative mp3 hd based mp3 players. The hd usually freezes up within 6 months of use even less and you have to send it back to creative for a hd repair, but the customer service is crap to say the least.
Pro:
- 3o gb of space plenty of room
- album art capabilities
- easy user interface in iPod as well as program supplied to transfer music. iTunes
Cons:
- although it shows album art the downfall of it is you have to manually upload those album arts. Typically it shows if u have purchased the dl through iTunes, but like me i download music from another source, there are already album art included with the music, but iTunes does not transfer the art into the iPod. You have to purchase a separte program such as iart to make it easier on yourself
- low sound. As compared to the creative i purchased the sound on the iPod is not impressive. You would think with the amount you're paying it would. I suggest getting better earphones which boosts the sound quality
Overall iPod photo 30gb is well worth the money

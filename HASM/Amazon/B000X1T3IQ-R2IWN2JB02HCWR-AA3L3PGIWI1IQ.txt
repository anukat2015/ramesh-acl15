Title: Olynpus E 3 body only
Content:
This a a wonderful product.  I have used an Olympus DSLR for several years, and the auto focus never seemed to be as good as some of the other top brands especially in low light or when there wasn't a good contrast.  The auto focus on this camera is excellent.  It will lock on to almost anything even in low light.  I'm especially pleased with its performance with birds in flight.

Title: vision attachments fall off
Content:
I have the vision cannister vacuum. I like its features and attachments. BUT I can not get the attachments to stay on. they keep coming off. I contacted dirt devil but they never answered me. Is there anyone who has this problem and has found a way to fix it? Otherwise I would say not to buy it.

I find the hose is not made well enough for what I use it for, 2 to 3 times a day vacuuming cat litter up.  I believe the hose may last at least a year which is good, but I had trouble with the other dirt devil I had with the hose giving out on me quickly.  I was unable to buy another hose for that one as it was discontinued, so I had to buy a new vacuum.  If dirt devil could make a better, more durable hose, that would be a definite plus.

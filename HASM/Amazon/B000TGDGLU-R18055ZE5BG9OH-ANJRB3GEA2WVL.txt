Title: Little chilly
Content:
This little heater does not produce the amount of heat that we expected. we are trying to heat a room about 8'X10', it take a long time for it to warm the room up.  It has no fan or blower system of any kind, since it does not get real hot, it takes at least a couple hours to warm the room. It never gets real "toasty" warm in the room.  I was disappointed, it works fine, but just seems to not have the power I thought it would.

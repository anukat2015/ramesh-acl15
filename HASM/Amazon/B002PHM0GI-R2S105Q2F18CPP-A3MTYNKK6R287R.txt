Title: Great desktop replacement
Content:
I wanted a tidy wireless replacement and am very happy with my Sony Vaio.  Weighing in at over 6lbs. it is not suitable for travel but works well anywhere in the house with a wireless router.   The speakers are disappointing and tinny sounding, but that's forgiveable considering the overall quality of my purchase.

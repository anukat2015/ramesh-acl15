Title: Excellent Value
Content:
I've owned this vacuum for over a year, and it still functions perfectly.  The suction is great, the filter is washable, and the carpet-beating attachment rivals the Miele of the same size.  I have two small dogs, kids and a passion for cleaning (lol).  This hoover is up to the task!  ***** full stars!

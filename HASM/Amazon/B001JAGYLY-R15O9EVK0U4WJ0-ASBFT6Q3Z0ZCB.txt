Title: Hoover Doesn't Exist
Content:
Bought this one week ago. Took it out of the box set it up and it seemed to work. The next day the power brush wouldn't function. Went to the Hoover web site and found the phone number. Called for support found myself in phone jail without any hope of speaking with a human being. Went back to the web site and found the name of the nearest warranty store, which turned out to be 41(forty one) miles away in Indio, CA although I live in the Palm Springs area where no source of warranty service exists. Went yesterday to the shop for service and they told me a problem with the hose connection to the power brush. Said they would order the part were not sure how long it would be for repair return. Although this after ten minutes of use. Further research on the web tells me that the Hoover Company has been sold an resold a number of times and is now owned by TTI Floor Care, in Glenwillow, Ohio. What a lesson in "Let the buyer beware". And shame on me for not reading although there were numerous  negative reviews that were available on the Amazon Web site.DUMB ME.

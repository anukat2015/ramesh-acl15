Title: Leaking carafe
Content:
I got this B&D coffee maker today.  It leaks coffee all over the counter when it is being poured. The lid on the carafe fits nicely and is easy to use. The problem is that there is a small welding defect in the stainless steel lip of the carafe that allows coffee to get around the O ring like seal with the plastic top. This is a case of poor quality control. I will send it back.
Had it not been for the leak I would have given this machine four stars.  With the blue LEDs it looks really cool.  The coffee in the pot was a reasonable 152 degrees F. without preheating the carafe. The coffee tasted good.  It has a large door for filling with water and was very easy to fill. With a brush or "sponge on a stick" device the carafe is easy to clean. The digital display is outstanding.  The carafe nests securely during the brewing cycle so spillage is unlikely.  The carafe holds about 35 oz of liquid when full.  For the features the price seemed good.  I did not test the brew strength control. 
Update: B&D sent me a replacement carafe at no charge.  The new carafe does not leak unless you pour too quickly.  Getting the last half a cup can get messy.  The base of the unit does make a disconcerting snapping sound like an electrical arc while brewing.  With a preheated carafe the coffee started at about 160 degrees.  After ten hours the half full carafe of coffee was 119 degrees - warm with good flavor.

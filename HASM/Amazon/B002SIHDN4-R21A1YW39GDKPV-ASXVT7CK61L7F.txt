Title: Really Disappointed
Content:
It took me 3 months to find what I thought was the "right" laptop.  My Pro-book has been a complete disapointment.  It came with the XP downgrade which I had to spend 2 days getting Windows 7 installed (which is what is claims it was made to run) since then the curser skips every 20 seconds or so to a random area on the screen while typing and the touchpad is all but useless.  Everything else is fine....however who cares when you can't type or effectively use the touchpad.  Also, have downloaded 2 fixes from tech support with minimal positive effect.
DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP!

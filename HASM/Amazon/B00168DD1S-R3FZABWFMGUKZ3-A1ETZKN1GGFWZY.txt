Title: Love this coffee pot
Content:
This has got to be my favorite coffee pot that I have owned. I like the 14 cup pot for guests. You can make 1/2 pot when you dont need a whole. It has a clock so that you can program for a fresh cup of coffee when you wake up. It also shuts off by itself so you never have to worry about leaving it on all day when you go off to work. Also comes with a gold filter. Love it!

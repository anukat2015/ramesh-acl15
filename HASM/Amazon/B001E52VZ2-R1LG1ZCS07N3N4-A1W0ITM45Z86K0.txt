Title: THE BOSS WILL PUT YOU TO WORK!!!
Content:
After reading many reviews myself, I opted for the EUREKA BOSS.  I was not sure of the difference between this model and the EUREKA MIGHTY MITE...I figured the BOSS had 12amps and could potentially supply more suction power.
  
I think the vacuum works well on bare floors, I cleaned my lovely hardwoods with no problems..and it did wonders on the bathroom and kitchen floors aswell.  However, I find that this little vacuum really puts you to work when it comes to cleaning carpet.  I must have vacuumed the same spot on my area rug 10 times before I was content with the results.  The same thing went for my low pile carpeting in the basement, after multiple passes, it finally got the job done.
  It comes with one attachment for both hard floors and carpeting, a brush tool for upholstery and a crevace tool.  It's compact enough for easy storage, however, it doesn't come with a retractable cord.  I like the fact that it's equiped with a HEPA filter, and I don't mind bagged vacuums, you toss the bag right out and that's the end of that, no messy jobs.
  If you have mostly hardwood floors, then I would recommend this product, however, if you're looking for superior suction to thoroughly clean your rugs in just a few passes, then you will be dissapointed.

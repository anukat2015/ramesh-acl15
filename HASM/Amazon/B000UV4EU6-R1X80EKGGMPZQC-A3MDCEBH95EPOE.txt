Title: Great Little MP3
Content:
This was the very first MP3 I've had and I'm extremely pleased with it.
Pros:
  Very large, clear screen compared to others
  Very easy to set up and download CD's -- and I'm a novice
  Easy to sort and organize CD's and navitate the different menus
  Lots of pre-sets for the radio
  Can't comment on videos, pictures, or other applications because I 
     mainly use it for music
  Ability to have a memory card -- I'll put my Christmas music on it
  Great sound for music, although ear buds that came with it aren't
     the best, but will do for awhile.
Cons:
  I've only found one.  The battery life isn't quite as long as claimed, but it's easy to recharge from the computer with the short cord that came with it.  Some don't like the short cord, but it works fine for me.  A cord to recharge it from a wall socket would be nice, but I'll buy that separately.
Overall, I'm very satisfied with the quality and features of this MP3 and would buy another one.  Very good value for the price!

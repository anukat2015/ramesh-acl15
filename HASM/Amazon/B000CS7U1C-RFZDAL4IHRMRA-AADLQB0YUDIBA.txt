Title: better than the iPod
Content:
* I own this item
this is way better than the ipod , way better and if you upgrade to windows player 11 you will have full control over the player making it easy to manage music files no matter howmanny you got ; i have about 1000 songs and some and i never messed up on having dubles or miss-naming the artist making it easy to navigate ex: rammstien, ramstien, ramstine
the only problem i have with it is size its a little too big and since this model of mp3s are somewhat rare ppl will often ask you "hey what is that, is it a bootleg iPod?" aso if your one of the ppl that are technical about 'size dont get this
-over all i give this a 5star because its long lasting and almost never freezes

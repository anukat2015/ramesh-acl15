Title: WOW.....thats a lot of money
Content:
I am not reviewing how this works b/c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but......i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player.  I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player (non-ipod) for about the same price, maybe a little more.  It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style.  I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion.  I just want to listen to music!!!!!

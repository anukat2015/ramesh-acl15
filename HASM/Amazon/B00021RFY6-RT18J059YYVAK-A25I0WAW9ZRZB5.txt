Title: Brews fresh coffee before you get up!
Content:
Not sure why such negative reviews.  Yes it is a little more difficult to clean than a regular coffee maker, but really what did you expect?  It is loud, but not anymore than a regular coffee grinder.  If you are not used to grinding your own coffee, than it might seem loud to you.  
I love getting fresh ground, brewed coffee made just before I get out of bed.  You set it all the night before, and just make sure you have CLOSED all the compartments.  Yes it will make a mess if you forget to close everthing (that must be what the previous reviewer did).  This is my 3rd grind and brew.  I have loved them all.  The first one gave out after 4 years of being used everyday, the 2nd one still works, I just upgraded to get this stainless steel model that also has a slightly smaller footprint than previous models.

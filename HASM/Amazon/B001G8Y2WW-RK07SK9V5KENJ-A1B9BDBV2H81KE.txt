Title: Not Happy
Content:
I bought this $130 machine a week ago and my $30 maker was better.  It doesn't keep your coffee hot for very long being it is a carafe style pot.  I have had to reheat after 1/2 hour. The coffee grinder does make course grounds and not strong (there is no strength button).  Yes it automatically turns off but that is because of the carafe.  If you decide to use ground coffee you still have to take apart the whole bean compartment after making a pot because it will rust/mildew from the moisture trapped inside the container.  
I am going to return and get a different one:(

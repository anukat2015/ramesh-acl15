Title: Great... except for the lid
Content:
These days I have a great mistrust for anything plastic that is heated in anyway so I wanted a metal pot. I'm low consumption coffee drinker but it tastes good to me. What I do have a beef with is the lid design. It's SO TIGHT! I literally have to fight with it to get it off. When I do yank it off, I'm lucky that the basket doesn't come flying out!! I do frequently get coffee splatter on my counter as a result. That's why I only gave it 4 stars. Other than that, it works well.

Title: Nice Price, Compact, Light Weight but........
Content:
This is a nice compact unit and seems to work well.  I have it in a 16x24 room that opens to my kitchen, dining area and hallway.  Within the 1st hour, the temperature rose 1 degree.  After 2 hours, the temperature was still the same.  This must be becuase of the adjoining rooms.  However, my furnace has not turned on since I turned this unit on.  Since it is a radiator type heater, there are no fans and is silent.  This is a nice feature!
The major downside to this, in my opinion, is that the face of the unit does get hot - too hot to hold your hand on.  I have little children and I don't think it is a good idea to keep this on the floor with young ones around.  It does have a nice feature to hang it on the wall, so this might be the solution.  Good luck!

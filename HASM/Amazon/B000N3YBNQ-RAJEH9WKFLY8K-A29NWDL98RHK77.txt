Title: Has a bad handle design or poor quality parts.
Content:
I've had this vacuum for 18 months and the handle broke after normal use.
It is not usable with a broken handle, so we put it in the shop and it is going to cost $83. to repair. Couldn't find receipt, so we have to pay for repairs ourselves. They had to order a new part, which probably won't last long either. Bad design or poor quality of parts in handle.

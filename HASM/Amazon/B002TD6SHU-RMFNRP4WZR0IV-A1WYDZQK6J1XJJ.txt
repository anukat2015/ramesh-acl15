Title: I am in love :-)
Content:
The best vacuum I ever had! Quiet, light and powerful. Switching between hardwood floor and carpets is as easy as switching the flip with the one foot. It is perfect. We were laughing with my husband that the more expensive model must be brewing coffee or offering the massage because it is hard to imagine even better performance :-)
Oh and one more amazing thing. I ordered it on Sunday and I had it delivered by Tuesday! Free shipping!

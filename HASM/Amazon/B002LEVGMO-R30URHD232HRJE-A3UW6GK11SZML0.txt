Title: Decent performance, good formfactor and trackpad - keyboard is lacking
Content:
I bought this unit because I needed something in addition to my normal laptop mainly for traveling purposes.  The screen is bright and sharp and the unit is relatively portable and aesthetically pleasing.  Performance while performing simple documenting editing and viewing web-pages was more than adequate and the system felt much more responsive than the Atom-based systems I have tried.  The only negative is the keyboard which I still found a little cramped and the keys having a mushy feel.

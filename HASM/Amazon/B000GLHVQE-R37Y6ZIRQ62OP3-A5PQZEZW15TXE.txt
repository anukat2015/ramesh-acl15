Title: Does Not Give Off Enough Heat
Content:
I bought this item to heat a 10 X 12 room. I had the french doors closed, and I put the Dimplex Electric Stove on high. After 25 minutes it still did not warm up the room. You have to sit very near it to get heat. I use oil to heat my home. I wanted to use this heater instead of the oil for a few hours. It is no good just as a primary heating source.
The flame looks very real, and it is well built.
If you want something for heat buy a 220v item.

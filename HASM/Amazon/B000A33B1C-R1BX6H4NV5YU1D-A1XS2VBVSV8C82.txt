Title: These heaters work!
Content:
I am ordering my third unit. I initially bought two, having used a much earlier model as a youth. They have enhanced the safety because they are much cooler to the touch. The timer feature is great, because I can't rely on the kids to turn them off in the morning. I feel they are very safe and don't worry about fires like I did with the heating element type of heater. The timer ticking is far less annoying than the electric fan or the constant noise of the thermal expansion of the metal and heating element you get with blower style heaters.

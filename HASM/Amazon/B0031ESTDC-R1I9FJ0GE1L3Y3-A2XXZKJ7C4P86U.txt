Title: Average laptop for good price
Content:
I did a lot of research before I purchased this laptop and it was by far the biggest bang for the buck.  Overall the system is fast and I have had no major problems.  The size is just right and not having a cd drive hasn't been an issue.  I have had problems with internet explorer.  I tried to install a video card update but unfortunately none exist for this type of graphics chip.  So now I am forced to use firefox which isn't so bad... If you are short on cash and need a descent laptop then I recommend this one.  If you have some extra cash then I would spring for a better one.

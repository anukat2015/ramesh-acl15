Title: Great laptop
Content:
I was in the market for a long battery life on a laptop, I ended up picking between this one and MacAir. I'm very happy with my choice, the laptop is light, screen is bright, keyboard feels great, graphics switching works like a charm. 
The only thing I do not like is the inability to simulate a 3 button mouse with the touch buttons. (I need this when using Xwindows but a cheap USB mouse addresses this issue). 
This is not the most powerfull laptop but I have no complaints about the performance, I can play games just fine. 
I have used the laptop whole day at work without charging, it is important to select the right settings when you want to get as much lifetime out of the batteries. I have been able to play games for about 5 hours so it is living up to expectations. 
The best feature of this latop is the screen brightness, it is just so much brighter than my old Dell screen it is not comparable.

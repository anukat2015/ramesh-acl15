Title: 10600 btu kerosene heater
Content:
bought two of these heaters both are the same one branded mega heat and 
the other heat mate, both work as they should except the both give off
odor while burning, i have two other convection style heaters that have 
no smell while running, but these two radiant models do give off odor.
i have dry burned the wick, unit has been adjusted just as manual says
red from top to bottom with blue flame on top , but smell is still there.
any ideas to get rid of smell would be welcome, get about 11 to 12 hours
burn time from full tank, if i could get rid of odor the would be great 
buy, stick with convection type kerosene heaters they seem to burn cleaner.
add on one year later, i changed the wick that came with heater to better
quality wick from miles stair wick shop , odor is no longer a problem i 
was told cheap wicks are thinner and allow smell, better wicks are thicker and fill channel tighter so no smell comes through,with this new
wick heater works perfectly with no odor, check out miles stair wick shop
for tons of free info on kerosene heaters.

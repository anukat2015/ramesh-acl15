Title: Great MP3 & MP4
Content:
In an iPod world, Zune is the only serious contender. I travel a lot and thanks to my Zune I am not stuck watching the same ol' airplane movies over and over. Easily charges on my laptop or in an outlet. The only feature they need to add is a sleep mode. That way I can set it and nod off without fear of waking up to a dead Zune.

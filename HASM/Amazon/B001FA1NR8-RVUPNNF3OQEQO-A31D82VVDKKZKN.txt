Title: iPod Shuffle Review
Content:
When Christmas arrived and I had wanted to buy something for my wife, I heard her saying that her old MP3 was too bulky and what did I think of iPods? When I first took a look at the iPod line I saw the cute little Shuffle model. It was smaller than a book of matches, plus was cute as could be in various colors! The Shuffle holds 240 songs or 1GB and you can easily make up different playlists if you over fill it or want to change genres. 
Light as a feather, cute and inexpensive....what's not to like?

Title: Well made and effective
Content:
I've had this vacuum for six months, and have already convinced a friend and my father (he actually said "I have vacuum envy" when he borrowed it) to buy one.  The first thing that struck me was the sturdy construction.  It seems solid and very well made.  (However, it's not heavy by any means.)  Also, the filter cup doesn't bother me like other reviewers.  I tap/rinse it out every ten vacuumings or so, and that's with two cats and a carpet.  The canister that substitutes for a bag is large and intuitively easy to pull out, tump out, and put back.  Also, I find that the vacuum works perfectly adequately on bare floors.  The cord retracts easily -- perhaps my favorite feature!  The only flaw I've noticed is that the carpet brush has never spun, on any surface.  I blame it on the extremely short pile of my carpet, but perhaps this is a bonafide defect and I should complain.  I really don't know.  But I use the brush attachment on the rugs and that workaround works great.  All in all, I'm in love with this little thing (especially after years of wrangling with a Eureka upright), and pray to the consumer gods that it never stops working.

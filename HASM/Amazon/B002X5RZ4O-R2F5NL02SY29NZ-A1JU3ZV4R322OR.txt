Title: great little vacuum
Content:
I've been looking for a small vacuum to leave upstairs in my house so I wouldn't have to lug a heavy Sears POS canister vac around. I saw this in Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $99 and with a 20% off coupon i bought it for $80. This vac is relatively quiet, has very good suction, is light and the bag less feature doesn't bother me as i figure I'm saving money on bags. I have 2 dogs so pet hair is a problem but not with this vac. The only gripe I have and it is a minor one is the cord could be a little longer but it is retractable. I would give it a six star rating if it had a power nozzle but what do you expect for $80.

Title: The BEST vacuum I have ever owned
Content:
I bought this Miele vacuum almost a year ago, after my electolux burst into flame and melted down!  I did a lot of research before purchasing, since I wasn't thrilled to spend so much on a vacuum cleaner.  But I have to admit, this one was worth every penny.
  
The suction is tremendous; you don't have to roll over and over the carpets to get them clean.  It is lightwieght, easy to manoever around furniture and has a great cord rewinder mechanism.  Even my husband was impressed with this vacuum.  It came with the power nozzle for carpets and brush for hardwood and tile floors.
The only downsides are the small size bags (although they are such nice quality--no dirt "leaks out" of them) and the cord could be longer.  But these are minor inconveniences at best.  This vaccuum is terrific, I would recommend it to anyone.

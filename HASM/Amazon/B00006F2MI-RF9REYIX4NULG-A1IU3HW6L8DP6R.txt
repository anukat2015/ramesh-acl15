Title: I Really HATE this Machine!
Content:
This is the worst coffee maker ever.  #1)  The coffee is LUKEWARM at best.  It does not brew at the proper temperature and it does not stay hot (whether you press the 4 cups or less button or not).  I have to heat my coffee up in the microwave before it is drinkable, which adversely affects the flavor.  Carafe does not keep the coffee warm and there is no warming element to heat it. #2)  Probably due to #1 above, the coffee is WEAK.  I have to use twice as many beans and half as much water as recommended just to get a decent amount of flavor... and this is using very strong and expensive gourmet French Roast beans.#4) What a MESS!  Grinder gets all covered with steam and has to be cleaned every time you use it.  I spend more time cleaning the machine before making the coffee than I do drinking the coffee it makes.#5)  You still have to premeasure the beans every time, unlike other combo coffee makers (e.g. Capresso) where there is a hopper that stays filled with beans and you just program how much to grind each time.  This sort of eliminates the whole convenience factor, as you might as well just have a separate grinder.DONT BUY IT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!

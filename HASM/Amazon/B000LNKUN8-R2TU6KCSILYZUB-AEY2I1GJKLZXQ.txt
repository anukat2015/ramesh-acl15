Title: Good fan for side wall.
Content:
I just installed this in our little half bath.  We wanted a fan that could be installed without tearing out shhet rock to run ducting and had an exterior wall in the room.  Installation of the fan was very easy and took maybe 1/2 hour.  I spent most of my time trying to splice into the light circuit and pulling romex.  The fan is not loud or quiet, really in between.  Many of the parts are light and a little fragile, but I was able to get mine in with out much trouble and even used the mid-wall extension piece that came with it.  I had to trim it with a pair of tin-snips as I only needed about an inch of it, but it all works fine.

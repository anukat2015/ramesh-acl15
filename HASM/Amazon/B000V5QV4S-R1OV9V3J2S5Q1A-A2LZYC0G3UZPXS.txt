Title: Great camera Great price
Content:
This is the second 40D our family purchased.  The new 50D is out and the 60D will be coming out soon.  This was the only place I could find the 40D still for sale and the price was right.  A refurbished 40D on Canon's web site was the same price with only a month warranty. This one was new with a year warranty and $250 less than I paid for my daughter's a year ago.

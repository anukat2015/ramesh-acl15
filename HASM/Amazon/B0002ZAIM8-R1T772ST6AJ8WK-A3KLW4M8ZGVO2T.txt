Title: Vastly inferior to the Creative Zen Nano
Content:
At the same $99 price point, the Creative Zen Nano has twice as much storage; a display screen; the ability to record via built-in microphone; the ability to play protected WMA files without converting to Apple's crappy AAC format, the ability to load MP3s directly into the machine without having to install Itunes, and the ability to tune in to FM broadcasts. Buy that product instead! The only reason to buy the iPod is if you want to be trendy and look cool by having the apple "name brand" item instead of a competitor.  (And if you're that hard up to look cool,  my sympathies.)

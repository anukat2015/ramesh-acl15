Title: Best portable computer on the market
Content:
This new iBook is the best portable computer on the market.  Its capabilities are outstanding, the build quality is exceptional, the design is stunningly clean and efficient.  This is a do anything, be anything computer that you can proudly use in just about any setting, for almost any computing task you can imagine.  Sure, a new titanium G4 is faster, but it is so delicate looking I would be afraid of breaking it in daily use.  Also, the iBook is roughly half the price.  Even PC users are enamored with the iBook's style and capabilities.  You will not regret a decision to buy this computer.

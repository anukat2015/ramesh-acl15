Title: Ladies And Gentleman, Presenting The Greatest Rip-Off Known To Man: The iPOD!
Content:
Boy, I was misled. I got the 20 GB iPOD M9282LL/A for graduation. For about four weeks, I had no problems with it. Some of my sister's songs got on it somehow, but I didn't make too big a deal of it (okay, I did at first). Then, while I was on the bus, the headphones started sounding all staticy. So when I got home, I took one of my old pairs and that problem was solved. Then we were having a party. I bought out the speakers so we can play some music from it. While I was searching for a song, the iPOD just froze. I got pissed off. I then learned it wasn't necessarily broke, it just needed to be reset. I got it fixed, and everything was fine once more. Tonight, however, the nail hit the coffin. I ried to import some songs on it, and half my songs were erased. My sister started having troubles with hers as well. Well, I have had it up to hear with it. It looks as if I will now have to resort to cds and my walkman once more. Come to think of it, I did kind of miss my old cd player. However, one thing is certain. I don't think I'll use an iPOD for a while.

Title: BEST Coffeemaker ever! NOT  Update
Content:
I love this coffeemaker.  I even gave up my Braun for it.  It does everything and then some.  Makes Great coffee, keeps it hot and is easy to operate and clean.  
UPDATE:
After one year it stopped working (warranty gone) I called and they sent me a packet of something to clean it with.  Didn't work.  I pulled out the old Braun and I've been using it without problem ever since.  It doesnt have the bells and whistles and doesn't keep the coffee hot. so I put the hot coffee into the Zojirushi carafe.  OK, so at least I loved the carafe right?  Today the bottom fell off the carafe. 
 
Looking for a new coffee maker and I think I'll go back to Braun.

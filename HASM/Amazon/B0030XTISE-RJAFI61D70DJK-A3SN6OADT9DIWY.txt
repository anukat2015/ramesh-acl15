Title: don't buy this one!!!
Content:
the touch pad on mine sucks so bad it's almost unusable! i can't beleive no one else is complaining about it. try scrolling down a page and it go's nuts.try and stop it before the bottom and your going all the way to the top! reading anything with this is the most frustrating thing u will ever do.
this is my forth laptop and by far the worst yet. yes i tried adjusting every setting and it still sucks..........

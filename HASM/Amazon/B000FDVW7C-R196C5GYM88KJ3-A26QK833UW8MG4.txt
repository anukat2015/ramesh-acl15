Title: No major complaints
Content:
I purchased this unit about 3 years ago to help take the chill off in my big old house.  I did not buy a stove to use as my soul source of heat, which is probably why I like mine.  I use a forced air oil furnace as my primary heat set at 65ish and use this stove to supplement.  It is very loud, I do have to say that.  The blower is loud and the auger feed is noisy.  Im sure that those noises are not any worse than average for a pellet stove.  What is very noisy and annoying is the thing vibrates now and then.  It seems to come and go and correlates with blower fan speed.  If it did  not have that vibration noise, I would like my stove much better.  The other complaint I have is the igniters go up like candy.  I have replaced 1 a year so far.  This year I replaced it and about 3 months later it was burnt up again.  My wife called the company and they said they had a bad batch of igniters and sent us a free one.  I have to give them props for that, but that does nothing as far as all the other ones I have had to buy.  The flame quality that this thing puts out seems much better than a couple of other pellet stoves I have seen in use. I would say the stove puts out the heat I was expecting and maintenance seems pretty easy for me.  My next purchase will be a furnace style pellet stove to replace my oil one and it will be through US Stove Company.  If this stove didnt vibrate and eat igniters I would give it a 5 star.

Title: failed too soon!
Content:
I only used this Brew n Go for about 10 days and only once a day and it failed to brew, no light no coffee! I owned one years back and it was great, perhaps I got a Lemon n Go. It was so inexpensive it was hardly worth the return. I have a larger Black&Decker coffee pot that works very well but I would have really prefered the Brew N Go for the work days.

Title: I love it.
Content:
I love my new ipod 4th generation. It looks great and the sound quality is good. It is easier to use this ipod's menu. It is awesome to play games on and my kids also love it. Both my 7 year-old and 11 year-old are begging for them. I do have some sympathy for those reviewers who are no longer able to charge using old devices. This is not an issue for me, as I am never more than a few feet away from a computer. The battery life could be better, expecially when using the games. Overall. 4 1/2*

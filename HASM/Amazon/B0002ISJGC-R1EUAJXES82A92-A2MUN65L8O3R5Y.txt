Title: Dangerous design
Content:
There is one single lid to the top of this coffee maker, and the lid is lifted to put in and remove the coffee filter, as well as to pour in water. Do you think the coffee is looking too strong? Do you quickly want to add a half cup of water to the reservoir? Lift the lid, and the boiling water, which comes out of a little arm attached to the bottom of the lid, shoots out at you. Do you want to remove the coffee filter right away when the coffee is done? Lift the lid again and the residue steam scalds your hands. Everything, including the boiling water spout is under the same lid. This is not designed safely.

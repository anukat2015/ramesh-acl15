Title: The best beginner DSLR in the market!
Content:
I started my DSLR experience with the E-510, while this was a quirky little camera that needed cajoling to perform well, the E-520 is nothing like that. After a year with the E-510, I ended up replacing it with the E-520 and what an improvement this camera is! A lot of quirks that the E-510 had (blown highlights, excessive contrast, bad LCD, underexposed mid-tones in JPEG) had been remedied in the E-520 and to add to that a bunch of newer features had been added as well. The most notable ones (for me) are:
1. Imager AF in live-view with face detection.
2. IS mode 3 for vertical panning.
3. Bigger and brighter and a more accurate LCD.
4. And by far the best addition, remote flash triggering for up to 3 groups!
It's amazing that Olympus could offer so much in a so-called "beginner" level camera and to think Nikon doesn't even offer live-view view! This is one of the biggest reasons for me to stick to Olympus as they don't skimp on features even in  lower-level bodies. 
I have no hesitation in recommending this camera for the first time DSLR buyer as well as a pro looking for a back up body for the E-3. Although compact, it's very nicely built and has a superior and much better build quality than the E-500 as well as similar Canon offerings.
I had the two kit lenses but sold the 14-42mm lens and kept the 40-150mm lens. I'm simply amazed with this lens as it offers an effective 300mm focal length in the smallest package currently in the market. I took the E-520 along with this lens to a recent U2 concert and the guards didn't even stop me as they couldn't tell what this lens was capable of by looking at its size! I ended up getting some stunning images with this camera and lens combo.
Last, but not the least, I would like to talk about IQ; Olympus has sorted out the tone curve in the E-520 and its MUCH better than the E-510 and allows amazing pictures straight out of the camera. I have no qualms using this camera all the way up to ISO 800, although at ISO 1600 the noise is higher than average and in some cases one will also notice banding in the shadows. I normally switch to B&W for ISO 1600 and that makes all the difference. However, in a pinch you can get some excellent ISO 1600 colour images as well if you're willing to shoot RAW and carefully process. This is about the only "minus" in this camera that I can think of.
Overall, this is an excellent camera and gives an excellent bang for the buck and I highly recommend it!

Title: Good coffee, but hard to clean.
Content:
Yes, it does make very good coffee:  water gets hot enough, pours through the grounds well, it's strong enough, and it tastes pretty darn good for they type of coffee maker that it is.  It is, however, hard to keep clean, as the coffee ground splash up onto the cover and around inside, and bits of grounds sometimes fall into the reservoir, which is not removable to clean, meaning you have to unplug the thing, carry it to the sink, dump in warm water, swish and scrub with a bottle brush, and then pour it out and rinse.  Annoying to be sure, but not enough to make me not buy it if I had the chance again.  BTW, this is a replacement for a great old Krups maker that finally broke and no longer has parts available, and it's at least as good as that maker was.

Title: Sony VAIO 17"
Content:
I love the big screen for movies and homework, it's a little hard to carry around so I bought a mini-computer, too.  The problems caused by the weight and size (need a large, stable space) and the fact that it heats up so quickly have begun to outweigh the fun of the large screen in most instances, but I still like it.  The battery only lasts 30-45 minutes without plugging in if you are using Wi-Fi, big drawback.

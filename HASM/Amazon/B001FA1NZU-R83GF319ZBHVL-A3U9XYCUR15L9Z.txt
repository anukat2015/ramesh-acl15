Title: Best purchase I have EVER made
Content:
I purchased the 2nd generation iPod Touch 32gig to replace my old iPod 5.5 Video. I must say, Apple wasn't kidding when they said that this is "the funniest iPod ever"! I do everything with it. With all of the features that it offers it almost seems like music was an after thought. I even decided again purchasing a netbook because it does so much. The only caveat being typing for any entended emails... Did you know you can make VOIP calls? All you need is WIFI, the free VOIP app(there are a couple), and the new APPLE headset with mic, and you are in business. Its like a super PDA dedicated to entertainment. Who needs an iPhone anyway? Trust me... the iPod Touch is the truth.

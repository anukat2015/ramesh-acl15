Title: thought long and hard before purchase; very satisfied
Content:
I wanted something I would take with me everywhere, all the time, but something still very functional.  I also wanted battery life that was so long I wouldn't need to think about it.  I looked at netbooks; I looked at the HP Pavilion DM3-1040US.  The netbooks were more portable, but less capable.  The HP was heavier, had less battery life, and (I think) an inferior processor.  I chose this Asus, and have no regrets.  The battery life is fully as advertised.  I take it with me everywhere.  Windows 7 works well.  Very satisfied.  No wireless problems either.
It is a bit flimsy.  The plastic wrist-rest creaks and buckles.  My other computers include a desktop Dell with XP PRO; a Dell 17 inch notebook with VISTA; a Macbook Pro unibody 15, and this Asus.  The trackpad is irritating, but anything would be compared to the Mac.  I tried the Samsung Go netbook, the HP 1040, and others.  All trackpads  (except on the MAC) will make your wrist lock up.  The HP trackpad was especially bad.  The Asus will win no prizes, but I just use a mouse when I feel the need.
The most important consideration for an ultraportable is that you want to take it with you.  If it's too heavy, you'll leave it home.  If it's too slow, you won't want to use it anywhere.  If the battery depletes to soon, there's no point.  This Asus is the perfect balance, at least for me..

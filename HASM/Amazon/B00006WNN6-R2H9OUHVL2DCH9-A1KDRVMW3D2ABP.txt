Title: No, No, No...Do Not Buy This Item
Content:
i don't write reviews, either i forget or i'm happy so it's not important.  however, this mistake i cannot forget.  i figured for fifteen bucks i'd just buy two and heat different rooms on the cheap.  these two little bastids cost more to run in the winter than my 10,000 btu air conditioner in the summer.  on top of that, they don't heat.  i don't know why, coils get red, fan occasionally spins, but i'm still layering sweatshirts and socks to keep warm.  not to mention they feel cheap, have no shut-off switch, and thermostat control (!) is worthless.  i cannot stress enough, do not buy this.  buy any other heater.  buy a nice robe.  get a dog from the shelter.  get married.  anything else in the long run will be cheaper and more satisfying than this stupid little piece o' junk.

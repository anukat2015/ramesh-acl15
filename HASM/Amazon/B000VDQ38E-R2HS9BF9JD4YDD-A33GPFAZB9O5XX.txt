Title: "Floored" at how much dirt came out even though I had used a Dyson previously.
Content:
The day our old vacuum died, I borrowed my mother's Dyson so I could finish vacuuming, and the next day my husband and I went vacuum shopping.
We came back with the Bissell 3920 Pet Hair Eraser, because we have a white boxer mix that sheds her hair all over our brown carpet and our red couch (which is microfiber suede so the hair gets embedded in it).
After I assembled it (which was incredibly easy), I decided to try and vacuum the couch to see if it would get the hair my mother's Dyson missed.  There was not a SINGLE hair left on my couch!  I know that sounds like an outrageous claim, but it's the truth.  So I kept going, even though I had vacuumed less than 24 hours before that with a Dyson.  So much dirt came out of my carpet in my livingroom and hallway alone, that I had to empty the container 3 times while cleaning!
The only downside to this vacuum is that if you don't tap the top half of the cyclone container a few times before you remove the bottom half to dump it, you end up with dirt on the outside of the vacuum.  It falls and lands on top of switch for the carpet settings.  But like I said, I figured this trick out after I dumped the container once, and haven't had a problem since.

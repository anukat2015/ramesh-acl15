Title: Sounds like a truck backing up
Content:
This coffee maker works just fine. My problem with it is that  after the coffee is finished brewing it lets out 4 REALLY LOUD beeps that sound just like the back up warning on a garbage truck and they are that loud no exaggeration. You get treated to one more BEEP when it shuts off. I know when the coffee is ready or the coffee pot shuts off even if I'm 40 feet away outside in the garage with the door closed. WAy too much information from a coffee pot! I would not have bought it had I known that. I emailed them and asked how to disable it and they said you can't.

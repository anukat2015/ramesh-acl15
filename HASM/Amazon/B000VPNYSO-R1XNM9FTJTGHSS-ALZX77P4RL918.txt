Title: Awesome Camera
Content:
I previously had a KM5D.  This Sony has dramatic improvments.  It is quieter, much faster, the controls are more intuitive and more accessible and the pictures look great.  One of the most dramatic improvements I've noted is the steady shot seems quite a lot better and is quite impressive.  I took a picture of my cat in low light with a Sony SAL70-300G at 180mm and f-stop of 1/2 sec.  It was acceptably sharp.  I was very impressed.

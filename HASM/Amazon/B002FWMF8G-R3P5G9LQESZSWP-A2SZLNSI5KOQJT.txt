Title: Frappes Made Super Easy & Diet Friendly (with the proper ingredients).  I LOVE this Machine!
Content:
The Café Frappe machine is just plain cool.  I started with the Classic Mocha Frappe (recipe included in the enclosed recipe book) and branched from there using available grocery store ingredients like:  Sugar Free Raspberry Syrup, Sugar Free Chocolate Flavored Syrup, Chocolate Chips, Fruit, Milk, Whipped Topping, Cinnamon and Vanilla.  NOTE:  If you want to try cinnamon, I like putting cinnamon in the brew cup so the coffee with brew with a cinnamon flavor.  I did not have trouble finding the 4 cup coffee pot filters in our grocery store, but agree that it would be nice if Mr. Coffee included some in the Café Frappe box so a buyer can use the machine right away.
The recipe book that comes with the Café Frappe suggests using a dark roast or rich espresso (regular or decaf) coffee, and I think this is necessary for getting the most flavorful frappe.  There are also recipes for Tea Frappes (and Alcoholic Frappes).  Our family tried a Chai Tea Frappe and all agreed that we prefer the coffee based frappes more.
All in all, our entire family really, really likes the Café Frappe machine.  It is fairly low profile, looks fine on the countertop, and makes wonderfully delicious frappes that satisfy everyone's sweet tooth (even when it is 0 degrees outside). 
  
Highly Recommended.

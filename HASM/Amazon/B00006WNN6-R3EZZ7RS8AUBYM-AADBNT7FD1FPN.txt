Title: Nice Little Heater
Content:
I like mine.  It heats our master bathroom pretty quickly.  I don't think it would be good for large room heating.  The only complaint I have is that you can't turn it off at the heater and when it heats to the set temp then the light goes off so you may forget that it is plugged in and on because it isn't running and the light went off.  It's like they wired it wrong.  Otherwise I love it.  I got mine on e-bay for $12.

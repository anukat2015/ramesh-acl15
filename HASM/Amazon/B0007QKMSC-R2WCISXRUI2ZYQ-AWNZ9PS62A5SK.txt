Title: Exellent Camera
Content:
I'll try to make this review as short and simple as possible.Let me start by saying that I am an amateur photographer. I travel a lot due to my proffesional affairs as well as personal. I needed a camera that could shoot fast and acurate pictures and would not be to costly. I purchased a Konica Minolta Dimage A200 ( which I use as a secondary camera ) but is a bit to slow for my taste even though it takes amazing pictures. Honestly, Canon's agressive marketing technique was one of the major factors in my desition as far as purchasing the camera or at least looking into it; the camera was displayed every where from Dubai to Europe to Asia to New York, so I started looking into it. The reviews were great and when I was finally able to get my hands on one at a camera store, I just fell in love with it, shorty after I purchased the camera, and have no regrets, especially after understanding all the menus and functions of it, I have become more of a photographer than I ever though I would be. I got a package deal over a year ago with SIGMA glass, decent but not the best I've seen. Invest in some good glass and you will not be disappointed. I though about upgrating to a different camera ( XTi, 30D, Nikon D40x even Nikon D200 ) but really have no need for it, it would almost be a "waste" for my needs and in my case, money is almost no matter, how ever I could just not justify purchasing something else! . I could go on and on about how much I like and enjoy this machine, however, I'll just make one last statement; if you are looking into getting into the SLR world, this machine will not disappoint you, get some good glass, learn the camera and just shoot away!

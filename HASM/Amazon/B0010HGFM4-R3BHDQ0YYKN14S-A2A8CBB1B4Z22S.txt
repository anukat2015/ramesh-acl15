Title: Great Camera - good as the 50d - good lens package.
Content:
The 40d is nearly as good as the newer 50d, but when I got mine the sensor cleaner malfunctioned within a week. I ended up returning it for a full refund after using it for several shoots, and got a 50d instead. Pictures in low light are slightly better with the 50d, and that was my biggest need. Everything else really seemed the same.

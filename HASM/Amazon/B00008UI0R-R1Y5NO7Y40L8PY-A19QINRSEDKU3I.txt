Title: Fantastic Vacuum
Content:
I chose this vacuum after doing quite a bit of research.  It rated very well with Consumer Reports.  I like to know I'm getting a good product but at a good price.(Amazon had the best price)  Now about the performance of this product, first, let me say, I have pets which leads to pet hair.  Previous vacuums left me frustrated.  They just couldn't completely get up the pet hair.  The first time I used this vacuum, I was amazed with how much came out of the carpets.  It lies flush with the floor so it's easy to clean under beds.  It maneuvers well and is lightweight.  It is easy to empty & clean.  I truly have no complaints.  I'm very happy with it and feel it's a wonderful tool for keeping a clean home.  I would completely recommend it to anyone.

Title: Not bad, but also not the best
Content:
We just recently installed brand new cherry laminate flooring and ceramic tile in our house and we wanted a vacuum that was made specifically for hard surfaces.  It's not really all that powerful, but it gets the job done for the most part.  It's good at sucking up cat litter and dog and cat hair, but as someone else said, it is hard to control.  It seems to have a mind of its own and goes in whatever direction it wants.  It also seems to fill up pretty quickly and needs to be emptied quite frequently.  However, I do like the fact that it is cordless.  For the price, it's not that bad, but it's also not something that I would very highly recommend either.  On a scale of 1-10, I would probably give it a 4 or 5.

i got this ipod for my birthday , and if you like a lot of music, get it, if not get a smaller version ipod,the music videos are 1.99 on itunes, songs are .99c , and games are 4.99 , movies are more up towards 15/20 bucks, its such a good toy for everyone, i listen to it all the time in high school studyhall/homeroom ,also if your apple earbud headphones crap out (where one side plays the other one doesnt-thats what always happens to me) go to apple support site and they'll next-day DHL you a new set , only catch is you have to send the defective ones back(but the mailer is prepaid so its no charge to send it back), i have the nano , and the video and ive gone through 4 sets of headphones , thats how im impressed with the customer service. my ipod crapped out bc i listen to it 3 hrs a day daily and change songs/volume frequently so one day i got a sad ipod icon and the ipod froze up alot, it was on a sunday night(late) i logged on to apples support site,put it in a dhl dropbox on tuesday afternoon and by friday i had a BRAND NEW replacement ipod(they sent me a prepaid next-day box for dhl to ship it back) the only hassles of that is 1. you have to go to a dhl drop box to ship it , 2. a few days without music lmao, i hope this review shows you how good the ipod is / and what support force is behind it

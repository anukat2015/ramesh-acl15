Title: Excellent Lens/Body Combo
Content:
This was my first real SLR, after a few years with a Sony MVC-400 semi-SLR. With that prior experience, the basics with the d80 were almost trivially easy to learn. 
The 18-135mm kit lens is a good all-purpose "vacation" lens, with only a tiny amount of chromatic abberation occasionally visible at 18mm (specifically sharp and distant objects in landscapes), and only then if you look for it.
Feels good in the hand even with a heavy lens.

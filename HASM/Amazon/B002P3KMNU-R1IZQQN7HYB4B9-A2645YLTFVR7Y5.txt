Title: Very nice laptop
Content:
I received this item 2 days ago, after a long wait....
I agree with most of the previous reviews with few issues of my own
Pros: 
- battery life: I have it set on "entertainment mode" and I got about ~8.5hrs of intermittent, but mostly continuous use. (brightness set to 30-40%, wifi running)
- design
- keyboard
- speed
- size
Cons:
- location of power jack (when I use it sitting in bed with my legs crossed, the part of the power cord that connects to the computer is resting on my right thigh and it is the most annoying thing in the world!!!!)
- touch pad (like everyone else...multi-touch seems very sensitive--I'm sure there is a way to adjust though)
- battery saving mode on Win 7 (I'm not sure if anyyone else's used this mode, but it looks horrible...)
There is a lot of chatter about the wifi issue at other forums, where people are complaining about dropped connections.  During my battery test run, I was able to surf the web without any connection problems.  I have Trendnet N router in my living room and I was able to get 4 bars from my bedroom (~30-35 feet) without any interruption.  I was able to stream videos on HD without too much problems.  I was also able to pick up my neighbor's

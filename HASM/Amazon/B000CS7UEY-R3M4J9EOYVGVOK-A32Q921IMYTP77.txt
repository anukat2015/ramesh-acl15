Title: Adieu Ipod  !!!
Content:
I got mine like a week ago and man i love this thing !  I can't lie at first i was kinda scared that it might not be as great as the creative zen micro i have but all that changed after 2 days using it . The quality is great the sounds is superb  , it is not limited as the Ipod video in options , let's be real there is need to think just get one . It was worth every penny . A full media center in your pocket .  A+  for Creative !  Ooh remenber to buy a screen protector to u will need it .

Title: Good entry level DSLR, but entry level is the key word
Content:
Some background, I owned a D40 and later upgraded to the D90.  I got a chance to play with the D5000 recently and have to say it's no D90.  Sure they have the same sensor and the image quality is GREAT especially in low lighting, but it's definitely not what I would call an upgrade for the D40.  A great replacement - much better than the D40x and D60 yes, but it's definitely in the same class as the D40 and you would probably outgrow it very quickly if you stick with photography.  
The only difference is that unlike the D40 which started out at around $500, the D5000 costs almost as much as a D90 and the D90 has MUCH more features.  If the price drops down to the current D40/D60 levels it would be worth it, but not the $850 it is right now.  Sorry.
Things I like:
great high ISO performance (low light for you non-photographers) - pretty much on par with the D90 and D300 and better than anything Canon has.
The swivle LCD screen - although I'd be a little worried that it might accidently break off
AutoFP flash -Although it's not the D40's true high speed sync, autofp will come in very handy with SB-600-900 flashes when you want to use a fast shutter speed when it's bright.  D40x and D60 did not have this.
bracketing - missing from all the other D40 gen cameras
11 AF points instead of the useless 3 on the d40/60
What I don't like:
NO AF MOTOR! that's what makes this an entry level Nikon in my opinion.  Sure all the new lenses are AF-S, but they also cost much more than the older gems out there.  In many cases you can't find an AF-S version of the lens anyway- like my favorite lens the 85mm f/1.8 AF-D.   Having lived with a D40 for a year, I can tell you manual focus is nearly impossible with these cameras.  You can live with it at first but trust me,  you'll miss this feature.  
No off camera commander mode:  Nikon has the BEST flash system in the world.  While AutoFP is a nice addition, you'll really miss CLS and the ability to remotely fire your flashes.  
No top LCD: The menus are logical, but there is nothing like the instant feedback you get from the top LCD.  
Camera is kind of small.  D90 and D300 are much easier to hold for a longer time.  
Not having the above features is not the end of the world, but again, this camera is only $50 less than the much better semi-pro D90.   If you're starting out, you might as well get the D90.  If the price drops down to $500 and you're on a budget get the D5000.  If you need a great started camera NOW and you're on a budget, look for a D40...there are many used ones at a great price.  
PS. with this recall business, I'd really stay away.

Title: great vacuum with messy bagless feature
Content:
I've had the Hoover S3765-040 for about three weeks. Generally, the machine performed very well. It did a good job of picking up dirt. The motor unit was pretty light and relatively quiet. 
There are some problems. The motorized head is heavy and pretty noisy, but it's very powerful on rugs. I ended up using the included floor brush on bare floors, which is a bit of a pain, but gets the place clean. The head, as noted by other reviewers, doesn't pivot, so it takes a bit more effort to guide it than with other vacuums that I have owned.
My big gripe is with the bagless technology. The container is easy to empty, but the filter is totally clogged after each use. The included filter brush is helpful, but I've had to wash the filter after each use. A bit of a mess, and a bit of a cloud of dust after each use. My previous vacuum was a fantom, which had a more pleasing design. The bagless feature wasn't perfect, but all the dirt easily came out of the container and the filter required no cleaning. Of course, the fantom is no longer made and I ended up keeping the thing going only with the help of superglue and duct tape.
Overall, the Hoover is quite a decent machine and an excellent value.

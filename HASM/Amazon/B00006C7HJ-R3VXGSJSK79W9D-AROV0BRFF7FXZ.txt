Title: Warm and silent but faulty thermostat
Content:
The heater gets full points for warm and silent operation but the thermostat is faulty. I don't know if the problem is specific to my unit but sometimes it toggles on/off for short periods. It runs for 15-30 secs and then shuts off. This happens intermittently and seems to be caused by a bad thermostat. Also, when the heater turns on, it draws considerable power which dims lights somewhat and trips my cable modem. But for these problems, I would have kept this heater.

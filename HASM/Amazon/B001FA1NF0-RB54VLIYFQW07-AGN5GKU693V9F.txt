Title: Great Ipod
Content:
I own a 30gb ipod video.  The batteries don't hold their charge as well as they used to and so I decided to get a 16 gb nano.  First of all, I love the size, I couldn't believe how small and light it was.  The capacity was great for what I wanted it for, I plan to just put the music on that I listen to most of the time and use the other ipod for everything else.  I found the click wheel to be responsive, I noticed that others had complained about that.  Now, I do have the bose speakers and JBL on stage.  The nano will play but not charge.  I looked on apple's website and it says that the nano is compatible with the JBL on stage II and III and the bose speaker II.  It doesn't tell you which ones will also charge the nano, I don't know how they are determining whether its compatible, will it just play it or play it and charge it?  I couldn't find that information.  Overall though I would recommend the nano.

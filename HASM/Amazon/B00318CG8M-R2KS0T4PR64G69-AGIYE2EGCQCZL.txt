Title: Great - but NO BLUETOOTH on the DM3-1140
Content:
Let me first say that is the by far the best laptop I've ever used.  I do a lot of web browsing, email, and MS Office apps, as well as Skype.  This laptop handles it all, and never lags, drags or shows signs of overloading.  I was a little apprehensive about lack of a DVD drive, so I went out and bought one that I keep at the office.  I have yet to wish I had it with me.  The DM3-114- is so small, light and thin it's really amazing.  The battery life, while nothing like the 10 hours advertised,is easily 4-5 hours of solid use for me.  Could be more if I turned down the screen brightness, I suspect.  
But if you're buying the DM3-1140, it DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH!  The reviews for the DM3-1140 and DM3-1130 are mingled together on Amazon, and apparently, the DM-1130 DOES have bluetooth.  So when you lookat the refviews for the 1140, you'll see 1130 reviews that talk about bluetooth. But I assure you the 1140 doesn't have it.  Even called HP and verified.  So if Bluetooth is a dealbreaker for you, you're not getting it with the 1140.  While that was a disappointment for me, I'm otherwise extremely happy with it, and would highly recomend it.
And what is all the fuss I've read about the trackpad?  Please.  It simply requires a very light touch.  Don't press down on the trackpad when you want to move the cursor.  It's that simple.  Yes, the buttons do require a pretty strong push to click, but i mostly tap on the trackpad instead of the mouse.  Problem solved.

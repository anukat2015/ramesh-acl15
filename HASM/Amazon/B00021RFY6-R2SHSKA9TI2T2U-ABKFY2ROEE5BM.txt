Title: Never made coffee before I got this machine
Content:
I am not a coffee drinker, and had NEVER used a cofee maker before.  However, in a last-minute dash to find a gift for my husband for his birthday, I purchased this cofee maker and some Starbucks French Roast beans at a local warehouse store.  My selection was influenced by several customers and passers-by who made unsolicited comments on how great this macine is.  When I got home, I read the instruction booklet carefully and within 30 minutes, had figured out how to set the timer.  My husband was elated when he awoke on the morning of his birthday to fresh-brewed coffee.  Easy, so easy even a first-timer can make perfect coffee!

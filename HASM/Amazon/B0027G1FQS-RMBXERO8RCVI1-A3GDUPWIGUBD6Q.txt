Title: do not let the look of this heater fool you
Content:
I bought this heater from Amazon in late November. Used it for a couple of times and now , in middle of December, it becomes a fan. Yes, a fan. There is no hot air coming out of it anymore . Maybe i just have a defected one. 
  Here are the pros and cons:
pros: - great looking.
      - easy to set up. 
      - the 90, 180, 270 and 360 degree circles are great.
      - heat up the room real good. 
      - 
cons: 
      - auto mode is very loud since it will run on hight setting.
      - no scheduling feature. 
      - it is very hard to open the bottom part in order to vacuum the air filter.
      - power cord is short so if you want to put it in the middle of the room and use the 360 degree feature, you are out of luck. In order to put it in the middle of the room, you must use an extender cord to plug it in and the manual said it is a no no. 
      - well, it is not working any more.

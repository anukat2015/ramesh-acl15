Title: Really Looks like a Fire!
Content:
I was surprised how realistic the fire looked when I first turned this on.
This is a solution to a thorny problem I faced. I have a rental property with what is either a faux or unfinished fireplace: depneds on your viewpoint. I didn't want to remove it,and i sure didn't want someone lighting a fire in it! 
I had available electricity and available gas, but unvented logs, though heat-efficient, can oxygen deficit a room if one is not careful. (And who wants to be careful when sleeping!)
So, I took a chance on this baby at net $175 after using my prime and offered Amazon discounts.
The two speed heater and blower is just about right for a small room.
This loses its fifth star because the designers placed the remote receiver on the wall plg instead of the unit. It belongs n the unit, so you can simply point the remote at your fireplace, and it works. 
In my case, the wall outlet is not reachable by line of sight, and so the circumstances rendered the remote control - an otherwise nice feature - unusable, and turn thisinto a manually switched fireplace.

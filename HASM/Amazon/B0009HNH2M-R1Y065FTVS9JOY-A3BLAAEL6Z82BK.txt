Title: Duros isn't durable!
Content:
After a year and a half of light use I have had to repair the main hose and connections to the power brush.  There have been months when the bags for it haven't been available and we've had to use our other lightweight vacuum instead.  
We bought this vacuum cleaner to clean the stairs and the loft level of our house.  Our main vacuum cleaner is a Hoover Windtunnel self-propelled upright model; the Duros isn't as efficient as that, but it does a satisfactory job of cleaning low carpet and hardwood floors.  The tools are a nuisance as they constantly fall off the machine, but, apart from its durability, the main complaint we have is the noise.  It has a high pitched screech I've been unable to tame - drives my wife nuts!

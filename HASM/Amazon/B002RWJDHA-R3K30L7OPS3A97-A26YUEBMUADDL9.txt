Title: Get What You Payed For?
Content:
I was a firm believer that you get what you pay for. If a few more dollars gets you a better built, longer lasting product that maybe even functions better - thats money well spent. Buying this machine does not follow that model. With the MT600, a few more dollars gets you something slightly worse than an entry level MrCoffee. I used my MT600 for three days and returned it. The biggest problems I encountered were with the thermal carafe. The first being a raised seam in the plastic spout which ran from the tip down towards the carafe. This caused the coffee to run back up the carafe and spill all over the counter. I tried slow pour, fast pour, contact with my mug, no contact etc. The spill was unavoidable. I ended up sanding the seam away with some fine sandpaper and the problem was solved. The next issue was the very poorly made lid. It has coarse threads that do not want to line up. However, the bigger issue is that it is two parts - the threaded section and the top. As you screw it down, if you turn just a little too far, the top makes contact, the threaded portion continues and it actually disassembles itself. Once this started to happen, I knew I was not getting the quality I had hoped for. On the upside, the coffee was very good. Based on this experience, I am a firm believer that you might get what you pay for but definately not if you payed for an MT600.

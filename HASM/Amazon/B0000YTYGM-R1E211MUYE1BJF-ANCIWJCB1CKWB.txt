Title: A great product at a great price!
Content:
My wife and I spent a lot of time looking for a RELIABLE coffeemaker that would make 12 cups, stay hot and work well.  We also didn't want to spend a fortune.  This new model Cuisinart has more than met our expectations.  We choose the black model, but white is an option.  The pot is BIG, easy to clean, stainless steel and keeps coffee HOT.  The lid doesn't have to be turned to pour, and it pours into the cup without any drips.  The water fill area is nice and wide.  It uses #4 cone filters, not one of those stupid metal filters that never work right.  My only complaint is that when you set it for autobrew there is no indicator light, just a little LED display (very small).  It also has a fairly loud beeper that sounds when brewing is done.  If you are using the autobrew feature it will serve as an alarm clock!  Other than that, we love it!

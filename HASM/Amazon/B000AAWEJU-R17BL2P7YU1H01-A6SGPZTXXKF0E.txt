Title: Amazing Vacuum
Content:
I like to clean.  I don't like a lot of noise.  This vacuum cleans beautifully when it's not even on full power.  I have bare floors and rugs, it handles both with ease.  I did purchase the brush head for rugs, although I'm not sure I needed to.  However, I am happy I did, since I like a thorough clean.  I've used shop vacs in the past, more inexpensive run of the mill vacs and for tough construction jobs, I'd use a shop vac.  Only beacause I wouldn't want to ruin the miele.  The miele is very powerful however and very quiet.  We have a 2 month old and she is soothed when I use it.  You can't beat the design as well, it's really pretty.  Anyhoo, I read some review where the person was upset they had to buy the brush extension for their rugs.  Well, I'm glad I did and I don't see myself getting another vacuum for years, which will end up in an overall savings.

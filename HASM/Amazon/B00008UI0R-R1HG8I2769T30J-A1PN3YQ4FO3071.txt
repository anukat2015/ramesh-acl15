Title: have no reason to be dissapointed
Content:
I've been using this vacuum for 3 months already.suction is great,easy to empty the dirt cup,easy to adjust the telescoping wand,to change power level.wide brush allows you quickly to clean big space.till now had no problems with this vacuum.so I can recommend to buy it.delivery was great,and in two days as it was promised.
PS:Dec.7/2008:it's been almost two years I'm using this vacuum.It's still working great!What else to add?

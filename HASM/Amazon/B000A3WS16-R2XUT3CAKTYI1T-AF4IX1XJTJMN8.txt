Title: Ipod Video
Content:
Overall the Ipod Video is an amazing piece of equipment to have. It's screen is alot better in resolution and size that i ever thought and runs videos smoothly. 
I would though, like to mention that instead of buying quicktime PRO to convert your videos into MPEG-4 you can use free alternatives like videora ipod converter. This is just as good as quicktime PRO and is absolutely free so i urge you to get this software instead of paying £30 or however much money it is.
Also if you are contemplating buying one of them i would urge you to buy a case before or right after purchasing the product. I was foolish and didnt bother buying one for a while and even though i was really careful with it, it still managed to accumulate quite a lot of scratches and blemishes.
Overall this is a great buy and one that you won't regret!

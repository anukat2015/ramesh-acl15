Title: Good DSLR
Content:
The Nikon D70S is a very good beginner to intermediate digi slr. Easy to use but also has a lot of options and manual settings. Battery life is amazing. Taken at least 500+ photos in raw format and still have half battery. Well built, strong body. 6.1MP is decent. Everyone now a days thinks more is better more is better however 6.1 is plenty for me. It all comes down to the photographer anyways. Good for people who are beginning digital photography, def. worth the extra money over the D40.

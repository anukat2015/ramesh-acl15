Title: don't go for bronze color notebook
Content:
Performance is good, lookwise it is good and come with good features but only problem is with keyboard color...you can't see lables/alphabets on keyboard clearly (because of bronze color) specially during night time...I am good in keyboard typing so it's fine for me ..if you are not good in typing and can't type without looking into keyboard then little bit you need to strugle in finding keys in keyboard.
This laptop worth it for $700....good value for money and go for it if you are comfortable with keyboard
I am unable to edit my rating ...I will rate this laptop for 4 out of 5

Title: AWFUL Vacuum!
Content:
This vacuum is fair for carpeting. It's VERY poor for flooring. We have owned it for 3 months and the carpet power head is already broken. The suction is fair. We are VERY disappointed with the quality of this vacuum for its very expensive price! I grew up with an Electrolux in the 1970's and that thing was an animal! My mother had that vacuum for almost 20 years without a hitch! We're going back to the Eureka Mighty Mite (which is under $100.00). The old Eureka we had did a MUCH better job being that we have 2 dogs and 5 cats. Crazy? Yes, but we love our animal companions! :)

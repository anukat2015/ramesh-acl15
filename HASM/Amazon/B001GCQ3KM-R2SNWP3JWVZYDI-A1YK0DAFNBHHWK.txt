Title: Fuze review
Content:
I like the product quite well, however there were no instructions included and it took a bit of time to become familiar with the product. I purchased a silicone sleeve. It protects the body but leaves the screen open to be scratched. Also, it impedes use of the on-off switch. Nonetheless, it's an excellent product and I am very happy with it.

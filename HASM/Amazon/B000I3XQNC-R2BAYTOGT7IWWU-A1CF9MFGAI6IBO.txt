Title: Excellent Product
Content:
I purchased this item in Sept of 2007 for a long trip to Yellowstone, Grand Teton Mountains, and Custer Park.  I took this camera with 2 others and used this camera all of the time except for video.  So far the camera has worked well.  I use it in combination with a Sigma 28-300mm zoom lens, a circular polarization filter, and Extreme IV compact flash card.  I do not regret this buy at all.
I use to use Nikon, but I'm really loving the Canon products lately.  And at the time of purchase, Amazon had the cheapest offer.  Almost every photo I took during my trip (about 18gb and not RAW format, lol) have been amazing.  I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for more professional images.
I love the features, but I recommend playing around with it a lot so you get the feel of all the bottons and features before you do a major shoot.  I like how the screen goes black when you put your eye up to the camera when taking photos and all the different modes to shoot with.
You do have to be careful with this camera, it can still get damaged like the old SLRs.  It's not like the point and shoot small digital ones that can stand being dropped a few times.  Overall this product is a great buy and worth the money.

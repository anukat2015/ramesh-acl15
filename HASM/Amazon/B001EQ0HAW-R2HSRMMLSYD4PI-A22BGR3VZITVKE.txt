Title: Battery Life Not Correctly Displayed
Content:
I bought this device from an upgrade on 80GB Zune.  I don't know if I had the bad luck, but the battery was either dead, or the battery indicator was wrong.  When it showed actually I had 3/4 of the battery, the player would actually would go dead because of the battery.  So, either there is something wrong with the software battery indicator or the battery itself.  Therefore, I am returning it.

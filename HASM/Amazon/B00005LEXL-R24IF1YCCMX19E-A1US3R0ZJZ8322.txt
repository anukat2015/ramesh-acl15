Title: Convert from small propane cylinder to 20lb propane tank
Content:
This hose assembly will convert from the small propane cylinder to the 20 lb tank.   5 feet of hose allows you to distance the cylinder away from the unit.   The only improvement would be a longer hose, but in many cases 5 feet will be enough.

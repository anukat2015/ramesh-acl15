Title: Great buy.
Content:
This is a great little coffee maker with the right price.  It replaces, and improves on, a Krups unit whose tissue-paper thin carafe broke.  The B-D has a much sturdier carafe, with the lip surrounded by a plastic protective layer to further insure a longer life.  Pours great, no drips.  Setting timer is intuitive and easy.  Recommended.

Title: BILL`S BEST
Content:
I purchased the Pentax K10D digital SLR about four weeks ago, and am very happy with this camera and the two lenses--18-55mm and 50-200mm. With the shake reduction and anti-dust features, You can`t go wrong. If you went with Canon or Nikon, you would pay through the nose for their lenses. The construction is very solid with seals that help prevent dust and water entering the camera.The features of the K10D make it a joy to use. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone moving up to a digital SLR. I am age 81, so it`s never too late to move up the ladder. W.C.RHYNE

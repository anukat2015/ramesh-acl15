Title: DOESN'T LEAK WHEN YOU POUR!!
Content:
[...]
We loved everything about it except that the pot itself leaked everywhere when you poured a cup of coffee. We actually looked forward to the day when the 1200 would bite the dust so we can look for a different coffeemaker. We were hesitant to buy another Cuisinart but after reading reviews for various makers...we decided that this model (at about half what DCC 1200 cost us) was worth taking a chance on....AND it's red and very pretty. It is a bit noisy during the brewing process but has a much louder tone (than DCC 1200) when the coffee is ready to pour. We love it. Oh...the three yr old DCC 1200 still works. I'm sure some curbside dumpster diver is using it right now....and swearing as it leaks all over the place when they try to pour their coffee. LOL

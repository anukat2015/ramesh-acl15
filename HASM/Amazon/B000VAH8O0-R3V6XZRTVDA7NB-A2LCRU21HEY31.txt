Title: WTF?!!
Content:
Very nice menu, good sound quality, but it had flaws since I bought it. Loading songs into the player was very difficult because it did not accept more than 5 songs at a time; it disconnects when you try to upload more. Moreover, in like 3 months it stopped working not matter what I tried to do. It just died.

Title: Love This Coffee Maker
Content:
I started drinking coffee again after a 15 year break (thanks to the wonderful Parisian cafes).  I got tired of the inconvenience and expense of going downstairs to the coffee shop once or twice a day.  I bought this for my office and it's perfect.  I can choose between 2-5 cups depending on my desire.  I can also make coffee for our occasional guests in the office.  It takes up very little space, rarely (if ever) spills, brews very quickly, tastes like any other great cup of coffee, can go between regular and decaf between brewings, the heat stays on until I turn it off and it's a perfect mini coffee maker.

Title: worth every penny
Content:
My husband works in our basement so I purchased this so he would not have to come all the way upstairs to get his coffee.  I love it so much that I am going down there to get my coffee now!  I guess I should get another one for the kitchen.  It really is great and unbelievably easy to use.  Definetly worth the money to get the good one.

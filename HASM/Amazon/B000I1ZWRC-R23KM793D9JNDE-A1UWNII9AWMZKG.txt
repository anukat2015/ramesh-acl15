Title: Impressive camera
Content:
I bought this Canon rebel Xti digital slr to replace a 1968 canon 35MM slr that needs to be repaired at a cost more than what I purchased this camera for.
I'm still learning how to use it,but so far it takes great photos,what my wife likes is she doesn't have to wait for photos.

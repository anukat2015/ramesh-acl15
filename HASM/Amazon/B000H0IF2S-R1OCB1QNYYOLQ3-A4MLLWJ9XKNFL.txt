Title: Not bad
Content:
I recently got this item for my sister back in India. The product is really cool, especially the size - very compact. But you don't have any control other than turning the shuffle on or off. If you really want to select songs u wanna ply, you have to go for players with a display and to fit into a &lt;100$ budget - u definitely cannot choose apple. Also the left ear phone produces some crackling sound often which is annoying at times. But I don't know if the warranty would hold good in India. So if u r buying this for someone overseas, think twice ... check the product if its absolutely fine before sending it over.

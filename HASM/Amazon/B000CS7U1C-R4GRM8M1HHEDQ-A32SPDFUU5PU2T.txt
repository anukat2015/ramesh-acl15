Title: Beats the 5th gen ipod and Zune by a mile.
Content:
The absolute best mp3 player I have ever purchased. Best picture clarity over 200k colors, best sound 192 kbps and beyond, microphone picks up my professors lectures easily and clearly, coverflow before ipod 6, 10 megapixel pics look like 10 megapixel pics on the zen, and finally battery life is awesome 20 hours audio 5 video. It's a little old now, but nothing new has been made that completely out shines it, if you can find this cheap don't double guess because its a little dated, buy it.

Title: This is the worst vacuum cleaner we have ever purchased
Content:
My wife bought this based on consumer reports recommendation.  What a crock of you know what.  With the power head on you can only turn it to the right.  What idiot would design something like this.  Would you buy a car that only turned to the right???
There is also some cheap c-clip thing that holds the power head on.  This clip is always getting knocked off and lost and then you are without the power head until you go online and find new ones-- (good luck finding them-- when you do you better bookmark the web site cause you'll need more later).  I just had to order 3 more at $5 each!!
Stay far, far away from this vacuum cleaner.

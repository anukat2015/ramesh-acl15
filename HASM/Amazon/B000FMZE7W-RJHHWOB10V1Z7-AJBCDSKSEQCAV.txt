Title: Best choice for those who don't want an iPod...
Content:
I hate iTunes, so i choose to avoid iPods.  This is the best MP3 player i've had so far.  Much better than previous units from Creative Labs that kept malfunctioning...
Pros:  Very easy to use, fantastic looking screen/menues/navigation, even the software is pretty intuitive.  Compatible with xbox 360 which is kind of neat.  Lots of space.
Cons: battery life kinda sucks, i usually have to charge it at the end of every day so it's good to go for tomorrow.

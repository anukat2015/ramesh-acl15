Title: Adorable, great sound, great vaule
Content:
First of all, for everyone who thinks that only the iPod has style--take a look at the iRiver. It's sleek and sexy as well as being fairly light. The controls are easy to use and figure out. The only gripe I have is that the power button should be recessed so it isn't so easy to turn it on and off if the player is in your purse or your pocket. It does have a locking mechanism so no harm no foul. 
The playlists can be generated through Windows Media or you can generate a quicklist on the fly. I would suggest using Media player unless you are just compiling a list of a few songs. 
The sound quality is excellent! And the headphone provided are OK considering they are the freebie type. The radio and voice recorder are also excellent--and there aren't many MP3 players that include both at this price!
Ahhh and the battery life is really good! It lasts for about six to seven hours for me. 
Overall, this is a great player, with a great look, great sound, and excellent value. If you don't want to get locked into the iTunes monopoly and want more flexibility with services such as Rhapsody, Napster, or Yahoo Music this player is for you.

Title: Best temperature for inexpensive drip
Content:
It's hard to get a drip coffee maker to brew at the right temperature, approximately 195 degrees Fahrenheit.   I have tried and tested several drip coffee makers and this one is the best I've found.  Although the Black & Decker doesn't meet the drip temperature specifications for making the best coffee it will begin at little over 170 degrees and toward the end of the brewing cycle it will reach 190 degrees.  Most others like the popular Mr. Coffees don't get much above 175.  I read the Bunn coffee makers brew drip coffees at the correct temperature but they only sale a 10 cup brewer or a pod machine and I think the water reservoir is always heated.  They are also a lot more expensive.  You can make improvements in brew temperature with this machine by filling the reservoir with hot water.  The coffee will then begin brewing a little over 180 and eventually get close to 195.  Caution: better not heat the water above 150 degrees before putting it in the reservoir or you will have a bubbling mess on your hands.
If you want drip coffee at the correct temperature it is probably best to heat your own water using one of the inexpensive (under $5) manual coffee filters.  This machine, although not perfect, is more convenient.  It is very cool how it automatically turns off and I really like the fact that it doesn't destroy the coffee with the usual drip coffee machine hot plate.
One other thing... I had a minor problem with the reservoir not emptying completely.  Jiggling the plug at the bottom of the reservoir fixed the problem.

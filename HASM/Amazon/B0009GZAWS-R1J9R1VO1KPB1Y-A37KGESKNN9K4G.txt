Title: Love the thing
Content:
I was looking for a digital camera that would not be outlandishly expensive, produced good quality images, had SLR design, reasonable battery life, did not have the very annoying noticeable lag between activating the shutter and acquiring an image, and provided the flexibility to be more than a `point and shoot' camera.  I found all those features and more in the Nikon D 50.  In my opinion it is an excellent digital camera and certainly more than lives up to its Nikon badge.  The battery life is unbelievable - I have taken several hundred images, downloaded them and accidentally left the camera on for over 24 hours and it is still going strong.  So far I have not found anything about this camera that I do not like.

Title: Heat!
Content:
We've only had this heater for a couple days. I was looking for something that didn't look like an ugly box, and I found this! Sure, its not really decorative, but it looks much nicer than most heaters.
We bought this to off set our insane gas heating bill. Heres to hoping it works.
It also has a couple timer settings on it. Press the timer button once, and it sets for one hour, twice sets it for 2 hours, pressing it three times sets it for 4 hours. If you press the timer button 4 times, it will set it for 7 hours.
You can also choose which heat setting you want to set it at. From 60 to 85. This heater also has an oscillation mode.

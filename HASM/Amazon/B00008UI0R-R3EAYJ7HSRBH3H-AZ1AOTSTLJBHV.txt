Title: Hoover S3765-040 Wind Tunnel Bagless Canister Vacuum
Content:
This the best Canister Vacuum I have ever used. It out does my high dollar upright in both rugs and hardwood floors. Don't get tricked in the hype of the vacuum the starts with a *D* it may be good on hardwood floors but when used on carpet the Hoover picks ALL the pet hair and everything that gets in its way and does not through it to the side on carpet or hardwood floors. Amazon had the nest price on the web by at least $160.00 and received it in a couple of days.

Title: Very Good (from a novice)
Content:
I just got this.  It has good sound quality.  The battery has lasted all week on one charge and still has a ways to go.  It has easy to use software - I know nothing - this is my first mp3 player - and it was all very easy to install and get running.  The player itself was very easy for me to learn to use - buttons are easy to use and the menus were easy to understand and use.  It is hard to find accessories at my local stores but anything I want is available online from vendors like Amazon and the online prices seem good.  The player was packaged well, very sturdy to hold up during shipping.  I like this and recommend it.

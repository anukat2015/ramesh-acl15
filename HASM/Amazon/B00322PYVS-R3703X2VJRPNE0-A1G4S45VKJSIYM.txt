Title: Everything I could ask for!
Content:
This Sony laptop is just amazing. It is everything I could ask for in a laptop. Here are some pros and cons:
Pros:
- Intel Core i7 is lightning quick
- Backlit keyboard is very useful as I use the computer in the dark half of the time. Keyboard layout is very neat and well-spaced.
- Looks very classy and barely shows fingerprints
- Blu-ray disc compatible. While it's not really needed, it is a good added feature
- HDMI output, big and wide screen is good for watching movies 
Cons:
- USB Ports aren't laid out very ergonomically
- Screen is a little dim even on max brightness
- Slightly heavy 
- Low battery life
All in all, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. If you are able to afford it, then I say go for it! It is def a bargain compared to the overrated Mac that people buy just to say they have a Mac. Don't believe that hype. This laptop destroys the Mac!

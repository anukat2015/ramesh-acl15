Title: Great intro camera to Digital SLR
Content:
As an amateur photographer, I bought this camera to enter the digital slr world.  I previously used a Canon Rebel 35mm and then a Casio EXZ57 (awesome small digital point-and-shoot, which I still love!), but wanted to expand my capabilities.  Now that prices have come down into my range, I excited bought and waited for the arrival of my Canon XTi, and my anticipation was well worth the wait!
For any other amateur photographers going from point-and-shoot to digital slr, it's important to note that in this model as well as most others, the lcd display cannot be used as the viewfinder.  Using the actual viewfind eyepiece takes a bit of adjusting to, but it all came right back quickly.
I am using the camera with a 35-80mm Canon lens which I had used with my Rebel, and so far that lens is suiting me fine.  I also purchased a SanDisk 2GB Extreme III compactflash card, which is very fast.  
The camera was easy to begin using right out of the box, and I find the manual to be extremely helpful and chock full of great reference information.  You can start shooting right away, particularly if you've used an slr before.  
I'm thrilled with this purchase and would highly recommend this model to any amateur photographers looking to enter the digital slr world.

Title: great classic, but not the best
Content:
this is my third ipod after the 3g ipod nano and the 1st gen ipod touch, and this is the best one although i was expecting more.
i like to have my entire video collection with me so the 8gb itouch wasnt enough, so i sold it to get the 80gb classic, and even though i can carry more than enough, the software is not that good is slow, sometimes freezes, the coverflow is uselees because of this.
i only have 12gb of space used so this ipod is more than enough for me.
the downside from being with apple is itunes, so if you want to change to lest say a ZUNE you'll have to do it all over again with your music library and stuff.
so if you havent decided yet, think twice before choosing one of them.

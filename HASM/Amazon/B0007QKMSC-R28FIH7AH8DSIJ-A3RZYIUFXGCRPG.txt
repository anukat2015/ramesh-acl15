Title: Best Choice Starter DSLR
Content:
I bought this camera for a college level mass communications photography class-it fits the needs very well, and people that rent the school's cameras are pretty jealous that I have a "big fancy camera".  I've made some really cool photographs so far, especially after learning the advanced settings (which really aren't that hard, especially if you practice).  I've only used point and shoot cameras, and this camera is a great way to get into "actual" photography-where you actually have to do something to make the pictures turn out well, as opposed to just taking pictures and accepting the mediocre images.  The lenses available are awesome, and some aren't too outrageously priced.  I'd suggest the Canon 50mm f/1.8 of f/1.4, because with the kit lens you really won't be able to do much indoors.  The kit lens isn't the best, but is leaps and bounds better than even the best point-and-shoot (I have a Canon SD1000, and from what I've used/seen friends use/read about, I don't know how much better point-and-shoot cameras get).

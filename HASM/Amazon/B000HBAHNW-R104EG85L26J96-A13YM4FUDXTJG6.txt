Title: Great for Low-Medium pile carpets, not thicker carpets
Content:
This economy level Miele model, as all the same cleaning ability as the more expensive models, Aquarius, and Capricorn, just without the electronic controls.  The machine comes packaged with their mid-size power nozzle, the 217-3.  This nozzle is great for medium-low pile carpets, and cleaning bare floors.  This nozzle is so versitale you won't have to switch cleaning head going from your rugs to your bare floor, just simply flip the switch on the hose.  The only surface this nozzle struggles on is the thicker carpets.  You will feel like you have just worked out in the gym for 30 minutes, if you have to vacuum thick carpet with this nozzle.  If you have thick carpets, or substantial pet hair, you'll want to move into a machine that comes with the larger 236 power nozzle.  We have sold Miele's for long time, and we don't hesitate to put our name behind them.  The best canister money can buy!  Expect 25+ years of use out of this vacuum.

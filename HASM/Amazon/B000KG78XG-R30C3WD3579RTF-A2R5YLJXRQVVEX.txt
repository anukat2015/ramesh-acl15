Title: Leica Digital V-Lux1 10MP camera
Content:
As an ex-Navy combat photographer, I can only say I wish that I'd had one of these babies back then.  Quick and easy to master, it's a snap to shoot single-handed.  No extra lenses to lug around.  The single Leica 35mm to 420mm lens is all you'll ever need.  Whether or not you shoot full auto or on automatic, the results are amazing!!  I'm currently shooting ultra-sharp photos of sailboats on the open ocean at 16x magnification off the island of Maui.  The camera stablization takes over and "shakes" are a thing of the past.  Think what you could accomplish using it for sports photography!!  It looks good, feels good, and it rivals anything in it's class for quality.  I own Cannons and a Sigma SD-10.....there's no comparison!  The Cannon digital Rebel SLR doesn't shoot movies but for the same price, this Leica does!  Probably the reason you don't hear too much about this honey of a camera is that the stores have a ton of inventory they've got to sell and if everyone knew how this Leica stacked up against the competition....there'd be a lot of sad shop owners holding the bag.

Title: Great purchase
Content:
The Cuisinart name speaks for itself once again. Great coffee taste, however a device to stop the flow oncethe cup is removed (after it shuts off) would have been a nice feature. If you don't wait long enough after it shuts off,you will get a few remnant drops onto the base.

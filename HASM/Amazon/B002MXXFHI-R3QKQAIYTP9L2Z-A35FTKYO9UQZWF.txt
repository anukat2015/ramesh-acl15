Title: Didn't last two months
Content:
I bought this player a couple of months ago. At first, everything worked fine on it. I loved the ease of use, the built in speakers & the sound quality. Everything worked fine until a few days ago when the player started freezing during playback and the buttons became non-responsive. Powering the player off then back on seemed to solve the problem. This happened several times until the player would no longer power on. No matter which button I pressed or how long I pressed it, the player would not respond. I tried resetting the player by pushing the reset button but this did not work. The player was fully charged and the hold button was not activated, so none of those issues was the problem. The player had not been abused or dropped or gotten wet. It had been treated with kid gloves. I was very disappointed that the player died so quickly. Luckily it is still under warranty (90 days) so I'm hoping for a refund or replacement. I'm hoping this was just a defective unit and not a sign of poor quality from Sony.

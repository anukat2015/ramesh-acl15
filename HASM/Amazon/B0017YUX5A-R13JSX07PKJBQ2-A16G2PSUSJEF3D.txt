Title: Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!
Content:
I actually can't believe this vacuum got such good reviews..this has to be the worst vac i have ever TRIED to use. The head of this vac is so light weight, it just bounces all over the carpet, it wouldn't sit flat on the carpet..its all plastic and the canister is soooo big and awkward..i'd never vacuum if i had this monster!

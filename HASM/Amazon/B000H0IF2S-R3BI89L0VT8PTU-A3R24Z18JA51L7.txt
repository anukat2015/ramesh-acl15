Title: Wow! So much sound out of such a tiny package!
Content:
I am truely amazed with this little tiny thing. It is smaller than a matchbook and light as a feather. I can't believe how good the sound quality is, it sounds the same as my new 60 GB Video iPod. I was expecting a lesser quality sound but was willing to deal with it to have it for its size and ease of carrying around, but when I pressed play and turned up the volume I was blown away.  
The setup was a breeze, just pluged in the USB cable with the iPod in its tiny cradle and iTunes new exactly what it was. I named my new little iPod "mini me", created and dragged a playlist to it and within a minute it was ready to play!!! It does need some time to charge, but there is enough charge already to test the little guy out. (You do need to download and install the latest iTunes from itunes.com if you don't have it already. I have been an iPod/iTunes fan for a while so I already had it installed.) 
The click wheel is very simple the top and bottom are volume control, the left and right are to skip through the songs. The button in the middle is play/pause. One cool feature is if you click the center button three times it goes back to the begining of the list of songs. 
The only downside is you can only have one list of up to 240 songs (1GB) and if you want to skip to a favorite song it may take a while to find it.  
I am curious as to how long the battery will last and how it will handle my abuse. I will update this review when I have more information. 
This little guy is well worth every penny, if you like to take your music with you, you will love it, you can barely tell you have it on you. No big iPod weighing your pocket down, this guy is light as a feather.

Title: An Awesome Product
Content:
I have to say that this is the best vacuum cleaner that my family has ever had. We have a Maine Coon Cat with long beautiful fur. Unfortunately, this long beautiful fur likes to cling to the carpet. With the vacuums we had in the past, all they would do would push the fur around so we had fur balls all over the carpet.
From day one, the Bissell Pet Hair Remover has been a god-send. In fact, the first time we vacuumed with it, it looked like we had had the carpet steam cleaned.
We are VERY HAPPY with our new vacuum!!!

Title: Customer service terrible
Content:
I read several reviews that described 1) poor customer service and 2) sparks and in 1 case flames coming out of the heater, so before purchasing this product, I called customer service myself.  I spoke to a woman and asked about sparks.  She said it normally sparks only when it turns on or off and hasn't heard of any problems but pointed out that there are several other operators there.  I asked her to check with a supervisor.  She did and he said that there have been a few problems with sparking and if this happens, the unit can be returned.  She denied that there have been any fires or flames from the units.  I asked her to put the supervisor on the phone so I could speak directly with him.  She was short with me and said he was on another call.  I told her there have been many reviews written about poor customer service with her company and that this phone call confirms that.  I explained that I will be writing a review about this phone call and it would benefit her company to put the supervisor on the phone.  She would not cooperate and the exchange became heated so I hung up the phone.

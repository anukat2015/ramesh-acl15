Title: It sure does suck
Content:
All I could think of after receiving it was the Suck n' Cut quote from waynes world: "It sure does suck".
I think as a cheap and portable vacuum, maybe something you'd clean your car with, its fine. It has good suction, but thats about it. The construction is cheap plastic, the attachments and hose are awkward to use and store, and the wheels look like they are ready to fall off. When I tested it out, it scuff my hardwood floors, but it at least sucked up the dirt. On carpet it is virtually useless. I vacuumed the same rug several times, and afterward I could still pick off fuzz from the rug with my hands.
Although it may have "commerical" in its name, its basically another POS fantastic plastic item. If you care about quality in anyway, I suggest looking elsewhere.

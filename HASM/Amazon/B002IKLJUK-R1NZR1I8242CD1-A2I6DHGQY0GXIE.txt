Title: Great little camera
Content:
Not much new to add here, except that I find the feel and use to be outstanding.  I can one-hand it very easily, it fits the hand very well, and there are no awkward inadvertent button pushes.  I like the top button that rotates to select single shot, multiple, bracketing, and time exposure.  I also have used the custom settings and the quick menu feature frequently.  It would be nice if it had a built-in viewfinder, but I am finding that I don't need it as much as I had thought.  And I much prefer the size to what would be required with the viewfinder.
I have both the 14-45 lens and the 20mm pancake, the latter being my first prime lens.  It is great, but you have to learn how to manage depth of field.  
I own a Canon 30D which I like a lot, but the size factor on the Panny is so much an improvement that I may sell the Canon.  The SLR is quicker on the fire and reload factors, but the Panny is good enough.  And did I mention it is much smaller than the 30D?  It's not going in your pocket, but it won't stretch your neck over the course of a day either.
I tried the Canon S90, and G11 as alternatives, but found them to be too slow on the fire/reload in comparison to the GF1.  All three take excellent pix, but in large format the GF1 leaves them behind.  Also the manual focus function of the GF1 is far superior to that in the Canons.  I found the manual focus very crude and nearly undecipherable on the Canons.  I still might end up with the S90 for my pocket, or maybe the Panasonic LX3, but that's for another time.

Title: the best darn space heater, EVER
Content:
i consider myself a space heater pro.  i have tried so many heaters and only this one, this year, has been worthy of a review.  BUY THIS HEATER.  i love it so much that i bought two more when i loaned my original to my sister:)
it is great.  the tower has two heat options that are fantastic.  it heats the whole room if you need it to.
a must have for chilly nights.

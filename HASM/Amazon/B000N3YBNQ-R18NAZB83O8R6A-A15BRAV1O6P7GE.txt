Title: Sucks!!!
Content:
This vacuum sucks!!!  (Literally.)  I had a Dyson and thought it was good, until I got this one.  This vacuum not only sucked better than the Dyson, but softened my carpet at the same time.  The bags could be a bigger, and it doesn't have any attachments; besides that, this is top of the line.

Title: Very satisfied
Content:
Overall, I have been very satisfied with the cooling ability of the unit.  Out of the box, it was simple to set up and install, although the included window exhaust adapter is not high quality (easy enough to make a solid one yourself).  The unit has been working nights with outside temperatures between 80 and 85 and easily brings the indoor temperature of our bedroom down to 68 while the rest of the house is set to 78 on the central AC.  
Pros: cost; low noise; dual hose essentially eliminates the need to drain the unit; cooling ability.
Cons: poor window adapter

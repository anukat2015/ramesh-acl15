Title: This coffeemaker made me a coffee lover!
Content:
I rarely drank coffee before and I sure hated to make it!  That's all changed with the simplest coffeemaker I have yet to see.This is the easiest coffeemaker I have ever had BUT it still has all the bells and whistles you could want!  My fiance and I wake up to fresh coffee every morning via the programmable feature of it!  I love the water filter, it makes a real difference in the taste.  And...the carafe pours like a dream...it cannot even be described how easily the water and coffee flow out.Looks great on the counter.  Have not used the self cleaning feature yet but the removable coffee filter is wonderful.  No need to by filters again and no mess or hassle.All in all, this is a PERFECT machine.  The unit is compact and sturdy and its ease of use, excellent products make it very efficient and clean.  I love it!

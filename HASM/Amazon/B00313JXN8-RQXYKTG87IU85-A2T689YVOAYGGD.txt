Title: Slot-loading DVD drive VERY noisy
Content:
The slot-loading DVD drive that comes with the S6040 model was so noisy and vibrated so much that I had to send the unit back.  For comparison, I played the same audio CD's on a seven year old Asus laptop with a tray drive, and there was no detectable vibration or noise.  Both the Toshiba and the older laptop were on the same, very stable coffee table.
The noise from the Toshiba drive was so loud it drowned out the music at normal playing volume.  The vibration ran from my fingers/palms way up my arms; it was impossible to ignore.
---> Note that I went to a BigBox store and tried the S6033 model (same CPU, but slower GPU and only 4GB RAM).  It has the TRAY-loading DVD drive and ran very smoothly and quietly.
This is a beautiful machine.  The specifications are dynamite.  (By the way, mine came with a 120W adapter, a good match for the Core i7 CPU.)
I can't say if the slot-loader was a lemon or typical.  One thing that bothered me was that the laptop was delivered in its own box only; it was not packed within another insulated box.  If audio-cables and paperbacks are well cushioned, shouldn't a laptop be too?

Title: Love love love it!!
Content:
It took me about an hour to program and install.  The instructions were super clear and it was really easy.  and programming wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be, based off of the otehr reviews I read.  I've have it over a month now, and know that I saved a lot of money already, but I do have a 10 degree difference from my night to day temperatures.  Definitely worth every penny.  I'm going to get my grandmother one too!!

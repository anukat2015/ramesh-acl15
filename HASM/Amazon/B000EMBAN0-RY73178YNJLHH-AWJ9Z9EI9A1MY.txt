Title: why did I buy this monster vacuum
Content:
I must have been out of my mind to spend so much for something that is wayyyyyyy too heavy, bulky and wide to do what I need done.. I only wanted it for upstairs in my townhome to clean around the floor from any hair my cats may have deposited.. I think that this vacuum is not any better than the smaller ones with the same amount of amps (12) that are very cheap to buy..  Try pushing this one around and lifting it..plus now there are two sides to clean instead of one and it doesnt seem to work that well on the bare floors downstairs.  There is more area downstairs without furniture where it could have a clear path, but if I have to put on a bare floor tool every time I used it, or an attachment just to get in spaces I normally could get into, then who needs it.. If the suction does go, as the previous person said, then Dirt Devil will surely hear from me and it will not be pretty.

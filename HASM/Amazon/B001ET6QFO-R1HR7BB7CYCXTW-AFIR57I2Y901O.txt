Title: VERY GOOD
Content:
I have to say they have improved over the 30D I had.  The sensor was what I wanted to get. After comparing photos to my D300 Nikon I would have to say at this point that the Nikon has an edge in Photo Quality. Of course this is just my opinion. That could take in several points,different lens,not as familiar with this camera as I am with my D300 yet. I have always thought that their is not that much difference in the two brands. 
  This camera is a very good camera and has all the bells and whistles that I am qualified to use.  Both the Canon and Nikon take very good photos. So I would say it is a personal preference to which one you like or have the accessories for.

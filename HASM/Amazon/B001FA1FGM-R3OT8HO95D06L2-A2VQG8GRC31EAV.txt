Title: Works great when it works
Content:
I use this heater in my 30' RV.  This unit heats the space equally and adequately when it works.  I have had problems as described in other reviews with the unit shutting itself off.  I will try roughing up the plug as described in a previous post.  Clicking sound when it powers on is not that loud, much better than a heater with a fan.
Update:  Changed plug, works same a before.  It may turn on and stay on, it may turn on then turn off a few minutes later, or may not work at all.

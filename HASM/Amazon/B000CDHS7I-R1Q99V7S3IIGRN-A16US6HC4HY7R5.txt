Title: Ok but not great
Content:
I like the looks of this black and stainless appliance and it doesn't take up much room on the countertop, but the operation and cleaning part isn't great.  The pot is so small and it's hard to get the last of the coffee out.  Hard to clean, too, since I can't get my big hand inside the pot to scrub.  But the coffee I can get out tastes just fine and is kept hot for a long time in the thermal carafe.  Average choice for the price.

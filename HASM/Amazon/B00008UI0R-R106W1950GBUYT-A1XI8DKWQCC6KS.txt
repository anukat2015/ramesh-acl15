Title: Great vacuum
Content:
I accidently ended up with 2 of these vacuums, but I've decided not to return one.  The vacuum is great!  It's easy to put together out of the box (once I finally checked the directions and realized there are a couple of rubber protectors that you have to take off!) and easy to use.  It picks up dirt and pet hair incredibly well on carpet.  I have not tried it on bare floors, but I think it would do just as well there.  My only complaint is emptying the dirt canister; I prefer bag vacuums because I make a mess every time I empty it, but otherwise I have nothing but good things to say.  It's so much easier to clean my stairs now!

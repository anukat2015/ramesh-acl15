Title: One word: Beastly
Content:
I am not a gamer, but I am a developer.  By far this is the most loaded laptop I have owned.  So far, it has delivered everything I need from it.  I use high memory consuming development programs, and they all run extremely fast.  Also, the graphics and screen look so crisp and clear... and I haven't noticed any hiccups yet, even when running several intensive programs.  Love it.

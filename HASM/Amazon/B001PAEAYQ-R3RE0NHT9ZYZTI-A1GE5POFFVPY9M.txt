Title: If it powers up..its a good buy
Content:
We purchased two of these for our young kids.  I was surprised at how functional they are for the price. The only issue I have with it from a functional standpoint is the short time the screen stays active (illuminated) during use.  If you wait for more than a second to key a selection the screen goes black to save power. This is really not a problem just an observation. 
Now the biggest problem I have with this unit is the fact that one failed to function right out of the box.  The manufacturer would have replaced the unit for me but the shipping cost would have almost matched the initial price of the product. I then contacted the supplier.  They agreed to replace the item without any trouble but again I had to supply shipping cost back to the vendor.  In the end I paid less than half the original price to ship it back but this time received one that functioned. My advice is to purchase this from a vendor that has return policies that don't incur any extra charges.

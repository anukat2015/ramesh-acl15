Title: Great Vacuum
Content:
This vacuum has everything you need in a vacuum. It has suction adjustment, attachments, (brush)roller control (on/off), double air filtration, and it's flexible. It finds dirt my old Oreck never even knew about. The only downside is that it sucks in so much dirt that you might have to empty the cup quite often. Our housekeeper loves it too. I highly recommend it.

Title: I got what I expected
Content:
I got what I expected in this coffee maker. We wanted to get away from the glass pot makers as you either let the brewed coffee burn in the pot, let it get cold or transfer it to a carafe. We looked at makers that brew right into a removable carafe, and they are nice, but this seemed to offer just about the best of all worlds for OUR STYLE of coffee drinking. Another writer indicated that this is just a glorified "Mr. Coffee" and they are basically correct, but the built-in carafe system, the key feature of this product, is just what we needed in our house, and this unit serves us well. It makes good tasting coffee, tends not to burn it over time, and has all the programmable features you'd expect in a product of this price. It includes a paper-free filter that cleans easily. I have not seen a single drop of water or coffee on the counter and the level indicator works fine. Note that we have large mugs and they fit right under the unit ( your mug can be 5"tall ). If you want your coffee maker to brew good tasting drip-style coffee, stay hot without having a burnt taste, and don't mind walking up to the maker for each cup, this unit could be just right for you too.

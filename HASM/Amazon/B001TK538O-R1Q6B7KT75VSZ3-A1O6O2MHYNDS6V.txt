Title: New Keurig B66 "Ultimate"
Content:
I have just purchased a Keurig Model B66 "Ultimate" and tried it out within the hour. My first opinions on this model are:
On a negative note... I found that the sound is noticeable when the unit is pumping the water into its heater. The individual K-Cup coffee containers while convenient, are costly per cup.
On the positive side... I drink black coffee and I feel that this unit does heat the water to a sufficient temperature and brews a drinkable cup of coffee very quickly. Another plus... Keurig also offers a solution for the "costly per cup servings" in that it sells a reusable coffee filter as an accessory. (This filter will permit you to use your own coffee which relates to a much lower cost per cup.)
My biggest regret about purchasing this particular model is that I didn't notice that the largest cup this unit brews is only ten (well 9.25) ounces... and not the twelve ounce mug size that I consider to be "my" standard size cup. In all fairness I can't find fault with Keurig for that because it clearly states the cup brewing size right on the back of the box.

Title: You won't die of Carbon Monoxide
Content:
This is a great heater,and safer to use than driving to the store for a gallon of milk. If you are worried about dying from carbon monoxide, and that's your thing, don't buy a ventless heater. But if you want to stay warm on a cold day, or want emergency backup heat when the power goes out, this is an excellent choice. If you read the website about carbon monoxide deaths, please note that it is written about Coleman heaters and at the end it mentions that there are safe heaters available that shut down on low oxygen. This is one of them. Also, if you check out the Mr. Heater website, you will learn that this is a variant of heaters that are approved by most building codes for permanent installation in houses, including bedrooms. 
Keep warm!

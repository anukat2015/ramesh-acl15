Title: Excellent addition to central heat system
Content:
My wife and I live in a 3bdrm 2bath home in northeast GA with a central heating unit. We purchased this unit because natural gas is very expensive because of deregulation. We placed it in our study, where we both spend a lot of time, and closed the heating vents. The unit heats up this 10 x 20 room on its own. It is difficult to measure the savings because the price of natural gas is going down, but I believe that our overall savings will make the purchase of the unit worth the expense, especially over time.

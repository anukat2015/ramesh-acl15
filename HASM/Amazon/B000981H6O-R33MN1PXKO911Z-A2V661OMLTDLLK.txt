Title: Hoover Hand Held Wireless Vacuum
Content:
I love this little hand-held vacuum.  It's lightweight, has good suction, and it holds a charge between uses.  I don't leave it plugged in, as I've heard that it is a heavy energy user.  So I just recharge it as needed.  I've used it for both wet and dry pickups, and it's done fine.  Also used it successfully to suck up a bug I didn't want to deal with.

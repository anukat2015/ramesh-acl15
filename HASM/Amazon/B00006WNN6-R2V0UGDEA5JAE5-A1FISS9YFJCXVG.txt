Title: Excellent supplemental heater.
Content:
We keep the themostat in our house set on a brisk 64 degrees, to try to save on our electricity bill.  However, there are some days and nights, when we need a little extra warmth to kill the chill in a room.  This heater works great for that purpose.  We use it in whichever room we are in, and it is portable enough to move around with us as we change rooms.  It has two heat settings, as well as just a fan setting.  Then there is a thermostat knob to adjust the temperature.  The only downside is that there is not an on/off switch, so we always unplug it when we do not want it on.  When set at the highest temperature, it will keep a 12 x 12 room warm with no problems.  Certainly worth the money to prevent cold fingers, toes, and noses.

Title: Makes good coffee - but for how long ?
Content:
This coffeemaker performs as specified - it makes good coffee - but it is extremely flimsy. The plastic used for the carafe lid is second rate - it actually melted somewhat and broke after 2 uses. 
After light use for a little over a month, the carafe sprung a leak. Replacements cost almost as much as the whole coffee maker.
I have discarded this item and am looking for a better product

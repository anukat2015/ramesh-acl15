Title: If you are used to an upright, don't buy this canister
Content:
I have hardwood floors and a few area rugs, so a friend advised me to buy a canister vacuum. I have had a bagless before and like being able to rid my home of the pet hair so I wanted that function. It did assemble easily and works well, but I dislike it more and more each time I use it. You have to drag the machine around as you work, and it gets hung up on furniture. I have a small home, less than 2000 square feet, but I must empty the collection bin at least three times per vacuum, if you go by the line indicated on the machine. I thought the cord would pull out as I went along, but there is too much tension so it pulls from the wall. You must work around 22 feet of cord on the floor as you vacuum. All in all, I am sorry that I changed from what I was used to. I am also sorry I purchased online, even though the cost was less. A local store would have taken a return with no penalty... Amazon will not give you a full refund so be cautious.

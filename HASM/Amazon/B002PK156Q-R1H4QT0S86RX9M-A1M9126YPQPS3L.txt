Title: Great Service Great Machine...
Content:
I find it strange that a couple of people (maybe the same person) complain about service for this notebook.  I called and had a response within 2 minutes.  I had a minor issue regarding the features on the notebook and was assisted and off the phone in ten minutes.
Perhaps if something serious goes wrong you may find it annoying.  For example, we have an HP notebook and it took 3 technicians and a supervisor and over 3 hours of our time to get them to ship us a replacement battery for a brand new computer.
The margins are very thin on these machines, so don't expect them to come to your door.  If you buy a $400-$500 computer you cannot expect them to provide you $400 worth of support time if you are inept in computing and not hardware savvy.
This notebook is an absolute steal for the money and very well made.  My only complaint and it appears in HP as well is the notebooks run a tad hot.  I have not had any problems as a result, but it may be a good idea to get a cooling pad for while you use it at home.  If you are a road warrier, traveling coolers are available as well.
The notebook has excellent battery life, an astoundingly nice display and a well designed keyboard.  All touchpad's stink, from the HP to Dell.  So, get a notebook mouse.
Great notebook for the money!!

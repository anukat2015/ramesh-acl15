Title: Great Camera!!
Content:
I totally enjoy using this camera.  Its low noise capability (after installing V4) exceeds my old Minolta 5D even though it has twice the amount of pixels.  
Pros:
- very fast focusing
- great low light capability
- great LCD
- great ergonomics
- 5 fps and addictive shutter sound :)
Cons:
- so so jpeg output (raw is much better)

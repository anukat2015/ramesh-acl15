Title: Excellent
Content:
I checked with consumer reports and they gave this vaccuum excellent reviews.  I also look at other peoples's ratings. I like everything about this product and advised my daughter to buy it. It is easy to carry up my stairs, has a wide brush that gets the edge of the floors and its suction is very powerful. I saw where some people said the dust cup was too small. I did not find this a problem at all. I just carry a small plastic bag when I go to another room and empty it. Because of the great job it does, I don't consider it a problem at all. I also enjoy the retractable cord. It makes it easier for storing. I highly reccommend this vaccuum.

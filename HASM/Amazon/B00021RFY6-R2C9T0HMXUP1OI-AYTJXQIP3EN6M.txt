Title: OMG!!  Best Cup of Coffee I've Ever Had!!!
Content:
This is by far the best cup of coffee I've ever brewed, hands down!  I debated a long time on buying this machine, especially with all of the bad reviews.  Ultimately, the price of this refurbished unit was the deciding factor in giving the Cuisinart a try.  I'm so glad I did.  After reading the directions carefully, unpacking the box, and running a "water only" cycle, I made my firt pot.  Delicious!!  I used Starbucks coffee and a paper filter since the refurb does not come with the gold filter.  I have ordered it and can't wait for it to come.  Not much maintainence like others have complained about.  Yes, you have to rinse everything and leave the top open to dry, but I expected that and its really not a problem.  It's worth it to taste that great cup of coffee!!  Oh, and it was packaged nicely in a box that would be fine for gift-giving - it is labeled refurbished, but that is to protect the company against unauthorized sales/returns, I'm sure.  A+

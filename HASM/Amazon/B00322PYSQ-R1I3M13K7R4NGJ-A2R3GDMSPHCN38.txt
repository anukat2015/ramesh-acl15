Title: Faulty product, and Sony won't honor warranty - beware, don't buy!
Content:
I bought this very Sony Vaio laptop less than a month ago.  Within 3 weeks of buying it, the top of the laptop started to discolor and warp from the inside.  After HOURS of explaining and re-explaining the situation to Sony's TERRIBLE customer service, they sent a box for me to send the laptop to California for repair.
A week later, I got an estimate from Sony for $177 for the repair.  They determined that they won't cover this repair, and implied that I did something wrong that caused my computer to warp and discolor from the inside.  I didn't.  
My experience with Sony and the VAIO has been extremely frustrating, and now I'm out over $800 for a computer that I can't resell from a company I will never do business with again.
&lt;u> Beware:&lt;/u> Sony's customer service is terrible.  If you have a problem with this computer, you are on your own - they will not help or stand behind the VAIO.

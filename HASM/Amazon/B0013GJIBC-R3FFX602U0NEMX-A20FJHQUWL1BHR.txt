Title: So far so good
Content:
I must say I was very nervous after reading some of the reviews in purchasing this product.  I took it out and charged it right away because I wanted to make sure it was gonna work.  It charged fully in just a few seconds, was very easy to get around and seems to work like a dream.  Some people had said that it was hard to use the touchscreen which was one of my main concerns.  The screen worked perfect and I have had zero problems in that area.  Another person said they felt the buttons would fall off any minute.  There are only three buttons on this product since it is a touchscreen and I found they were just fine.  I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and I must say I am jealous already.  I paid over 100 bucks for my MP3 player and it isn't even close to as cool as this one is.  I'm not sure if people were dissapointed they did not recieve an IPOD Touch or what, but for under 50 bucks I am extremely pleased with this product.

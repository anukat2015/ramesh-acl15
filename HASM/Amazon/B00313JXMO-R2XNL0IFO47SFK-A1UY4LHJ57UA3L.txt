Title: Fast Fast Fast
Content:
First time buying a Toshiba - run 15 Dell computers at work but the last laptop I got from them was a true lemon.  Finally, after 2 years of crashes and such, I bought this laptop off of the reviews.  It is a fast, solid, and reliable computer.  The only small complaints I have are that the DVD player is loud and the finish shows lots of fingerprints - but this is small stuff as I use this computer for heavy graphics, website design, accounting programs and other business uses.  It has not crashed in the week I have had it and it does every task much faster and smoother than before.  The keyboard is very nice with a full number pad and ample typing room.  The screen is beautiful.  A great product for the price and in all honesty, with an i7 chip and 6GB of RAM, I don't think you can get a nicer computer for the money.

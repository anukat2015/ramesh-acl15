Title: Not What I Expected
Content:
I had a water cooler when I was a kid and it was great. It blew strong cool air, the kind that keeps you cool without seeping into your bones like ac air can. With that memory in mind, i ordered the Sunpentown and was very disappointed. No matter how much cold water and ice i poured into the unit the air was never more than tepid. In addition having to refill it and add ice all the time was a real drag. Too labor intensive. I think i'll stick with the ac's, bones not withstanding.

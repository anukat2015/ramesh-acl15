Title: Best heaters out there
Content:
I always buy Lasko brand heaters.  I love the digital controllers and they are accurate (unlike many other heaters I have tried).  Some heaters put their sensor too close to the heating area so that it reads abnormally high after running for a few minutes, thus turning off the heater.  The Lasko heaters do it right.  The temperature you set it at is the temperature the room will be.  Also, they are quiet.
In addition, these heaters last.  I have owned my original heater for five years, when I bought it on a whim.  It has lasted and lasted!
I also like the remote control features (this one does not come with that option, but many do).

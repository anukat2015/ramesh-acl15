Title: Works well for it's intended use
Content:
This works well for its intended use. It is not an air conditioner, but it will cool off a room and help keep it cool through the night, which is what I needed it for. I use cold water I keep in bottles in the fridge, and tried adding ice cubes (which didn't seem to make much difference). I use a 1.25 liter seltzer water bottle, which has a long neck which helps when adding water so you don't spill. It holds quite a bit of water (4 or 5 of those water bottles), and if I fill it up before bed, it has enough water for the entire night. I like the design of it, it looks like a box fan, and it's easy to move around, just slide it along so you don't spill (if it has water in it). I only need it during heat waves, so I can put it away when I don't need it. I live in a dry climate, so this will not work well in humid climates. It seems well made and makes about the same amount of noise as a box fan. It also uses much less electricity than an A/C unit, but it takes a bit more work, keeping it filled with cold water. Depending on the heat, it might need filling every few hours, but I only use it late afternoon/evening, and overnight. It is of much better quality than other evaporative coolers I have seen in the stores, and the price is about half as much for the ones in the stores of similar quality.

Title: Terrific laptop
Content:
I decided on this laptop as a replacement for our 4 year old HP desktop. The HP had served us well but was beginning to show its age and was not able to handle updated software, like Kodak Easy Share, with higher demands on memory and system resources. After many hours searching info and reviews on the net and visiting local stores, I decided Toshiba seemed to have the most faithful following and repeat customers.
This laptop has everything we were looking for and more. The 16" screen is beautiful and sharp, the speakers surprisingly good for the size, and the keyboard layout works very well providing ample wrist support. 
I wasn't sure which processor to go with (Intel or AMD), but as far as I could determine, the only advantage of the more expensive Intel might be in some gaming applications. As I am not much of a gamer, I was very comfortable with the choice of AMD and have had no problems with them in my last 2 machines.
Overall, my biggest challenge was migrating data from my old machine (the DVD drive jammed on the first disk.) Not wanting to buy special transfer cables, etc., I found the express port on this Toshiba accepted all of the old memory cards I could scrounge up from other cameras etc.
Originally, I had planned to purchase from Toshibadirect.com, however I was able to get this machine from Amazon and saved money not having to pay shipping or sales tax.
All in all, this is a great performing and terrific looking machine, and I would highly recommend it.

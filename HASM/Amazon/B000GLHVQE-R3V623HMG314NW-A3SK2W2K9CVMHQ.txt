Title: Cute but weak
Content:
I have to say I bought the little heater primarily for its decorative value.  I have it in a vacation cabin I rent out in North Georgia.  One of the bedrooms is in the basement, and it stays chilly year round even though the climate in the area is generally mild.  It works well enough in the tiny, windowless room, 10X10, but I can see that it would be useless in a large drafty room.  The warm air flowing out from underneath is more like somebody's warm breath. I will say that it is cute as a button and the "fire" is cheery.

Title: Not my favorite Canon
Content:
I have owned the xsi for about six months now.  Overall it's a good camera, with just a few quirks.  The image quality is good although it sometimes takes awhile to hone in on your target in AF mode.  I love the larger screen on this camera - a definite step up from my Rebel XT.  The flash really leaves something to be desired, especially when it fires several times prior to taking a picture in low-light.  My camera had the dreaded "BUSY" reading that many people have complained about.  It is currently on it's way back from Canon's repair facility and I'm hoping they found a solution to the problem.  A good starter dslr, but with it's plastic body and so-so results, I'm wishing I'd have gone with the 50D instead.

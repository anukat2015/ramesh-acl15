Title: Perfect for RV Travel
Content:
This item was not purchased on Amazon and is well worth the $40 paid.
What I like:
  Programmable timer
  Auto shut-off as soon as coffee is brewed
  Size of carafe
  Unbreakable carafe
  Overall size of coffee pot
  Coffee is still warm after 3 hours if lid completely screwed down
  Easily stowed while RV in motion
What I dislike:
  I have to remove the lid just like opening a pickle jar. A problem for arthritic hands.
  The current time can be accidentally changed quite easily.  Need for "Set Time" button.
  
I love that I can program this coffee maker and if I oversleep, I still have nice, warm coffee that is not burned three hours later.  The stainless steel carafe, cord storage and overall size make this a great coffeemaker for RV trips (depending on your counter space).  We used it in a 24-foot Tioga.  While driving the coffeemaker is stowed on its side in the sink.  Great!!!

Title: Great for a student
Content:
I was looking for a light and powerful laptop, which is still a rare combination for under $2000. So far so good with this machine.  It runs perfectly and has very long battery life as stated.  I use multiple programs at once and the fast processing capacity of this computer work great with everything I have tried.  Would recommend to anybody looking for a good deal that doesn't want to sacrifice portability for functionality.  Looks great too and is surprisingly thin - just as thin as the Samsung netbook I had before, but runs like a full-size laptop.

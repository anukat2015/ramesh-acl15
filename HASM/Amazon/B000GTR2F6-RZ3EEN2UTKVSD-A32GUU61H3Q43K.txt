Title: Wife loves it
Content:
Her sister has one and she asked Santa for one.  Santa obliged, and she loves it.   It is set to come on automattically at 0600, which it does.  Originally we had it programmed to shut off at 0730, but the one hour auto shutoff didn't like that.  It is now programmed to shut off at 0700.  No big deal.  Only issue is that she likes two cups of coffee in the morning and it frequently shuts down after the first cup.  I have yet to use it as I am a tea totaller, and still boil my water in a kettle.  The kids like making hot chocolate.  We rarely use K-cups, opting insted to use the reusable filters.  Hopefully it will last as long as the under-cabinet Mr. Coffe brewer that she used for about ten years, and still uses when we have guests.

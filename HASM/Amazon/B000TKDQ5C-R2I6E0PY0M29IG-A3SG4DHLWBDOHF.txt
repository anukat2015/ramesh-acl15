Title: good but be very careful
Content:
the size, portability and heat output are very good. my hugest fear is a fire hazard. read the instructions VERY carefully, to avoid a fire. i did have to completely rearrange a room to keep things safe. i wish this hadn't been an issue. i wish it was already manufactured with safety in mind.

Title: Great radient heat
Content:
This product was slightly bigger than what i expected, but its not obstructive in the least. In fact, one thing i like about it is that it has a fairly wide base, which helps prevent tipping by me (i run around a lot) or my cat (who loves to knock everything over)
Lots of people seem to complain about the lack of directionality on this product. Perhaps if I was working at a desk or large area and wanted to just warm my legs up this wouldnt be ideal, but if you have a room in a house that you want to be completely warm in a relatively short period of time, you should check this out. My current house has heating problems, and I've been using this heater throughout the winter, pretty much every day. On the high setting, it can heat up a small room in minutes, and I then switch it to low. Usually I leave it on the lower wattage output and it does a good job keeping the room at 68 degrees. 
Most importantly, the safety features are very good on this, and the heating element is well protected from contact. 
Its about average as far as sound goes for heaters.
I havent found a single fault with this device so far, and I hope it will last me a few more seasons at least. For $20 or so, its a good value.

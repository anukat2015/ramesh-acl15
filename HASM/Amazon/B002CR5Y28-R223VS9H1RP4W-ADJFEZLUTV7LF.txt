Title: Powerful, compact and light; good for hardwood floors/pet hair
Content:
My partner and I realized we needed a new vacuum cleaner shortly after we got a puppy.  The pup sheds and brings a lot of dirt into our apartment.  We got the Neptune from a local dealer--we chose the model because we have all hardwood and linoleum floors and I wanted something light.  The Neptune comes with a non-HEPA filter, but it's easy to buy a HEPA filter and pop it in.  What I love about this machine:  1) the heads maneuver easily under furniture -- especially the parquet twister.  2) Great suction, surprising for such a compact machine, but much quieter than our old upright.  3) The variable power settings are useful for vacuuming different surfaces without damage.  I can even vacuum my 5 month old puppy's fuzzy coat on the lowest setting with the upholstery head without freaking him out.  4) The bag is designed for easy replacement without scattering dust.  
Limitations of the Neptune to consider if you're choosing between Miele models:  The Neptune's bag is on the small side--the price of having a compact machine.  We've only had it a week and a half and the bag indicator reads half full, so we expect to spend almost $100/year on bags.  Blame it on the dog.  Also, if we had a lot of carpeting or allowed the dog on our furniture, we would have bitten the bullet for one of the more expensive models (like the S5 series) that come with electrical powered brush heads including the mini version for upholstery.  The Neptune can't take these, and only has an air-powered turbo brush head.

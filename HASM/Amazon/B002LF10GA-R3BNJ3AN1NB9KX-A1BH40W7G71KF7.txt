Title: Very nice so far!
Content:
I've had my computer for about a week now and am very satisfied with its capabilities.  I've used faster computers, but not of this size and frankly I didn't buy this for the speed.  My primary uses for my Acer are e-mail, surfing, IM, and the occassional Office application work (such as typing this in Word to make sure I don't embarrass myself with spelling errors!).
On to the things you may want to know if you're in the market:
Pros:  size, weight, battery, fast wireless connectivity compared to my ooooold Gateway laptop, 5-in-1 card reader very handy, powers and interfaces with the external hard drive well, no problem viewing *.avi movies recorded with my Hero cam directly from the hard drive, no problems viewing videos on line so far
Cons:  keyboard a bit prone to causing mis-strokes since the keys are flat with no "cup" whatsoever, no Windows system disk included (I have yet to find the time to contact Acer about this to see if I can download the OS...I'd appreciate any advice on this!), sound isn't great through the internal speakers but probably right on line with what you would expect in a computer this size, touch pad lacks defined edges (though I'm adapting to it easily).
All-in-all, I recommend this computer.  I rated it at 4 stars due to some of the minor shortcomings but given the choice I would choose this again over other computers.

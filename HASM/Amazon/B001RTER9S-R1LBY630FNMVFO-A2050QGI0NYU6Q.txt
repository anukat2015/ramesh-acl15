Title: Some shortcomings
Content:
I bought this unit used, in very good shape.
I would say that, after 4 days of heavy usage It's 12000 BTU's are NOT enough to refrigerate a 180 Sqf room with a big window facing South. (summer time, with just a 90F temp. outside)
Also, its has NO movable / adjustable air deflectors; they are fixed and the air flow is too low, given the fact that cool air  goes down.
Another con, it's a sealed unit, meaning, you need to get special repair service to install a refrigerant charge valve in order to supply R407C ecologic gas, which is more expensive than others.
Mine started leaking water from the bottom. I disassembled it, and after 18 screws, couldn't find the problem. Went online and found some people with the same problem: there's a small hole (you need to take off the left cover) that had some lint and was obstructing the flow of condensation water to the sink below: I had to use a wire, back and forth and VOILA, no more leaks. THIS IS NOT EXPLAINED IN THE MANUAL.
Pros are it's portability and lack of installation.(holes, etc.)

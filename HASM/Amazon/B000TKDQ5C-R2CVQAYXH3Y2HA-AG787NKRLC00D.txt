Title: It's PERFECT!!!
Content:
I bought this heater to warm up the room for my newborn baby, and it's absolutely perfect, I love it!!! It's so small, that it fits on practically any surface, and even in our tiny bathroom, so that I can warm it up to bathe my baby. It heats up the space very quickly, it's much quieter than the larger electric heater that I have, it turns off when the room reaches a desired temp., and when the temp. is falling again - it turns on automatically, so I don't have to worry about overheating the room, or it running on constantly and spending too much electricity. I should have bought one more for our other bedroom.

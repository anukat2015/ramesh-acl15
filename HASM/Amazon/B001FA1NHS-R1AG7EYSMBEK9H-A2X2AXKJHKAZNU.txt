Title: Okay, but not great
Content:
I have both a touch and a nano.  The touch is ten times better.  Only advantage with the nano is it can handle more abuse.  I do not like the wheel.  Controls on the touch are excellent and very easy to use compared to the wheel.  If you are a klutz this might be good, but otherwise get a touch.

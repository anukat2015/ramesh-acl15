Content:
Had This For 2 Day's Now. 
I Like It,But I Don't Like It. 
I Was Happy,But Also Disappointed In This Product. 
Temp Control Goes From 60-90
Pro's: 
1.Came UPS,With Tracking Number.
2.Awesome Display Panel,(Red,Blue,And Orange) 
3.If I Leave It On 72 Degrees Large Room Setting,It Kind of Warm's Up My Whole Single Story House,Which I Like. 
4.I Like That It's On Rollers. 
5.Very Small Remote Is Nice Too,With Loaded CR2025 Battery. 
6.Nicely-Packed And Secure. 
Con's: 
1.Emit's An Acrid Smell,That I Don't Care For,And Yes,You Do Notice It. 
2.A Big ADVERTISED Box,Letting The World Know What You Got.

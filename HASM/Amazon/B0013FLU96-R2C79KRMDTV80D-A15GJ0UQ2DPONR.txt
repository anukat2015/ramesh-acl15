Title: MacBook Pro an excellent workhorse ...
Content:
Easy to use MacBook Pro.  I bought it with it's stock hard drive 250GB 5200 RPM.  As soon as the computer had arrived I have changed it out with a Western Digital 320GB Scorpion Black 7200 RPM 2.5IN 16MB hard drive and the same time I had upgraded the memory to 4 gig as well.  It is faster then ever.  Apple's stock hard drive has only 3 years warranty and a slower performance.  The battery life it is not exactly a cake walk, at least not for me.  It gives you between 3 to 4 hours function, pending what activities are you going to do with your Mac.  But overall I'm very happy with this purchase.

Title: Just what I needed!
Content:
I purchased this heater to heat my massage therapy office. So far it has worked great and my clients are toasty. It's nice because it's quiet and has many adjustable heat levels. I have found that it takes a good 20-30 min for it to crank up and heat the room when I first turn it on, but after that it stays very warm. Since this is the first winter I've had it I'm not sure if it will favorably offset my oil heat bill, but I'm hoping so. I've also used it in my apartment. It worked great for two regular rooms or one large room, but beyond that it struggled to keep up. I purchased it in Nov '07 through Amazon for $58 (no ship fee), but see that they have reduced it to $50. I am completely satisfied and think it is well worth the price even at $58.

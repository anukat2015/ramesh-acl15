Title: Very Noisy
Content:
I was hoping this model would be on the recall list because it broke right away. It is very noisy but the heat still works. I know how silent these heaters are as I know people that have them. I just purchased the new AVH2 model because we really need it for our pop-up camper. So far I love it, it is very quiet and puts out a continuous heat instead of turning on and off.
I hope the company recalls the VH2 because it is too expensive for it to break so quickly.

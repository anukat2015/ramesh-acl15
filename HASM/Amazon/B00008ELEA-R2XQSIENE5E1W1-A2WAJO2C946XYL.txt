Title: outperks a drip
Content:
this is the first time i purchased a electric percolator
and its the best coffee maker i have ever used
i am glad i read the other reviews on this product
and bought this Farberware Percolator
yes you should clean it after each use,only take a couple of 
minutes but it always best to make coffee with a clean pot!

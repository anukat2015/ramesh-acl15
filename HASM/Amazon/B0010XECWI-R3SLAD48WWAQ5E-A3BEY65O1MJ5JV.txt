Title: Very average!
Content:
I bought this so we could make a cup of coffee after dinner rather than make another entire pot.  My husband and I like our coffee fairly strong.  The first mug I made was like drinking lightly flavored water.  I then made a second mug using only 1/2 mug of water.  Coffee was still very weak.  The HB brewer was very fast and I was excited to use it.  Finally, I made a mug with 1/3 cup of water and 1 pod and it was good coffee.  However, I see no point in making 1/3 cup of coffee and using one pod for it.  Finally, as a last attempt, I tried using 2 pods for a mug and water spewed out all over the place.  So, I learned not to use 2 pods at once.  When I made a mug the next time, I used one pot and when it was through brewing, I took the pod out and put it in the coffee mug like I would a tea bag.  After 3-4 minutes, it was strong enough to drink.  I have now packed it up in the box for a future yard sale and bought a Keurig, which is absolutely fantastic.

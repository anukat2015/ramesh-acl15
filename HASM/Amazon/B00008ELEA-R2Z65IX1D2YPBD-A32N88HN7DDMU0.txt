Title: Best Coffee Ever!!!
Content:
I have used Farberware percolaters for 25 years and they make a great cup of coffee. It has to be handwashed and not immersed in water, so keep that in mind. Also most grocery stores sell the paper discs you place in the bottom of the basket to keep the grounds from falling into the coffee. I highly recommend using them, they are not very expensive.  I highly recommend this product.

Title: amazing!
Content:
i am completely in love with my zen.  seriously.  i don't get attached to gadgets, but i looooove it.  i have over 300 pictures and 1200 songs on it so far and don't crack 4 gig.  it will be a lifesaver on my next uk flight.
yahoo's music engine works with the zen but not the ipod.  for around 10 bucks a month, i can put almost any freaking song i could possibly want on not only my laptop but my zen.  no more buying cds almost ever!!!

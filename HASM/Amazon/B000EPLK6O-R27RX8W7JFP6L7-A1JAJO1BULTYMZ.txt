Title: Beware of Flawed Design
Content:
I purchased this coffeemaker based upon others' comments. This coffeemaker is very easy to use, simply designed, and easy to clean. If you like drip coffee, it makes a very decent tasting cup. The reasons I gave it 4 stars is beacuse I think that the price is too high. Also, pouring the hot coffee can be tricky. If you remove the filter basket, the coffee spills on the counter when it is poured. This happens even with the lid still on the pot. If you leave the filter basket in the pot, you must remember to hold the lid while you are pouring because the manufacturer says that injury could occur. Why charge someone so much money for a flawed lid/basket design that could cause injury?

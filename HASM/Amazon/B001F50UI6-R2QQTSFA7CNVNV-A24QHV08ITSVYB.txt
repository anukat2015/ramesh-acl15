Title: Great sound, not so great usability
Content:
There seems to be a trend among gadget manufacturers to create more and more dumbed down versions of their early hits. I looked for player giving most bang for buck and based on reviews this was one.
The good stuff: most important thing - sound is great. Navigation is easy (I really like folder navigations).
The bad stuff: earphones are useless. Their sound is clear with good bass when inside ear, but pure plastic won't stick to it and they always get loosened, sounding like tin can. I always tried to press them more and more which ended in massive ear pain and finally ordered Koss KSC75. All sound enhancements from previous versions are gone. When playing music title, you can't click genre and display all similar titles from library, which is again nice feature removed. Radio, which was somehow important to me, depends 100% on player orientation, so no fm listening when cycling.
And why, oh why they removed pin for neckband, so forget about hanging it around your neck while exercising unless you invest in 20$ carrying case.
Would I buy it again? If there are no older 6/7xx versions on sale, yes.
If you can get these goldies, get them! Because right now there is some bitter taste when trying to figure out where to wear it without pockets.

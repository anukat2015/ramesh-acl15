Title: smell makes heater unusable
Content:
This heater can certainly heat. We bought it to make a three-season porch comfortable in cold weather, and the room was toasty in 50-degree weather even with the windows open.
Unfortunately, the windows needed to be open because of the stench from heater. The manual says to run the heater in a ventilated area for two hours to burn off the smell. I tried 5+ hours a day for a whole week, and the burning oil smell is as strong as ever. My children use the room and I don't want them breathing in such fumes.
Amazon will pay return shipping, but this will be a pain to lug to the post office.
Another note: One parent felt the heater stayed cool enough to be safe for children. I disagree. It gets quite hot, and I think a baseboard-style heater would be a safer choice because it is lower-profile - the Delonghi is right at face level for toddlers.
It seemed that most reviewers felt the smell wasn't a problem, so I overlooked those that thought it was. Maybe we just got duds - or maybe we have better noses! It just doesn't seem safe to breathe fumes like this.

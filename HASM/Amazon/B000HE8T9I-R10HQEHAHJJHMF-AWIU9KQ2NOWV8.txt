Title: Please don't buy this!
Content:
I bought this at Bed Bath and Beyond. It was one of 2 vacuums that I could use for my carpeted stairs. It was AWFUL!  The damn thing kept falling over on me and it was heavy to lug up and down the stairs. And as far as for pet hair pickup, it was a joke. It missed so many things that my cheap upright bagged vacuum would normally pick up. It was cumbersome and not easy to use. I just want to vacuum my damn stairs. Why is it SO difficult to find something that works?? I packed up the damn thing and I'm going to return it tomorrow. I'm so disgusted. Because they advertised that it's great for pet hair pickup on the exterior of the box, I fell for it.  Don't be an idiot like I was and buy it because of that. It's a joke.  I'd like to stab the person that put this POS together in the eye.

Title: Excellent Ultra Portable/Netbook
Content:
Got this laptop for my birthday a couple of days ago.  Registered it with Acer, order the Windows 7 RTM free upgrade and upgraded the current Vista OS to Windows 7 RC.  Love it.  In fact, three other people I have shown it to have ordered one also.  Runs HD recorded ATSC TV, HD Movies, MS Office, and surfs the web very well.  Windows 7 operates much more efficiently and with far fewer headaches than Vista.  This item is priced extremly well.  Dell had a similar model with an inferior processor and with only a three cell battery and they just bumped the price up to match this price.  So, for the money this is the best product on the market.  I did try using it for Flash online video.  It does ok with Hulu standard def but chokes a bit on 720p HD.  I have two Nvidia Ion Nettops and the GS45 isn't quite as sharp, but for the money this is going to be the product to beat for several months in the netbook/ultra portable arena and is an excellent addition to my HTPC Nvidia Ion Windows 7 Home Group.

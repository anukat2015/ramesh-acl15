Title: Big mistake
Content:
Unit came with defective hairline crack in water reservoir. Ruined $400 area rug and wood floors underneath it on the first day of use. It was supposed to turn itself off when the water reservoir fills up, but did not. Extremely irritating draining process even if it wasn't cracked. Wish I had chosen any of the other competing air conditioners found on amazon. Never buying a Soleus product ever again.

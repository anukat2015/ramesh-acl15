Title: The Elite laptop of all!
Content:
It is everything in a laptop i dream of and more. super fast, in all aspects of what I want to do, be it video editing, music editing, or writing a  resume or just plain surfing,it is the best OS of all! My only peeve is that the hard drive is not a true 320GB hard drive (298?). Other than that, this laptop blows all of the rest out of the water. On Boot camp, a vista OS never had it so good with the ultra crisp graphics and and vivid color. That is the only thing that vista have over leopard, but leopard eats it up overall. Highly recommended if you want the best of both worlds in OSes, this is it and no other. That alone in my book makes this system worth every penny and once you go mac.......you never go back! My Imac pushed me away from PC's and there is no more need other than other particular things that windows do that OS X do not. Great investment, worth every dollar in my opinion. Parallels in an awesome hit as well! so many features, that will blow you away. Just a true blessing to have.

Title: Just OK thermal coffee maker
Content:
I've had my Mr. Coffee since Christmas '06.  I thought to wait before writing my review after using it for awhile and trying different coffee beans.  This is my second (different brand) Thermal Coffee maker.  It makes decent coffee.  Keeps coffee hot for a couple of hours. (after pre-warming pot) Pause-and-serve function spills a couple of teaspoonsfulls.   My work-around, pull pot partly away from drip spout and catch coffee drips until it stops.  I don't use the timer because I like to grind coffee beans at time of making coffee and not sitting in the coffee maker over night.  On/off function shuts off after brewing.  Coffee maker is attractive, but not well made.  My coffee maker lid sits off center.  Not a big deal, but more steam escapes because of this.  Some reviewers had pouring problems.  I found matching the lid arrow to spout gives the best pouring.  Can be messy while getting that last drop.  Overall this coffee maker is "OK" until I find a better one.

Title: This is a great iPod and easy to setup
Content:
I am now in love with this iPod.  I bought it for my wife for christmas; and as expected I got to set it up.  It could not have been easier.  I just followed the online directions, and linking to the computer was automatic.  The memory is plenty for what we use.  If you plan on watching a lot of movies you may want to get the 32 GB.  Though I think the screen is a little small to watch an entire movie.  Battery life is good but could always be better lasting a couple of days.  I love the touch screen and being able to use wireless.

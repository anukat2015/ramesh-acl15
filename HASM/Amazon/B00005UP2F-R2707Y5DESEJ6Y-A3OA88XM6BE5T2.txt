Title: Buy something else
Content:
Don't buy this vacuum. It takes more time to empty the dirt cup and scrape the hair, dust, and crumbs off of the filter everytime you use it than it does to vacuum the floor. This is such a nasty process that you may want to take a shower when you are done. Not to mention the fact that the "power brush" powerfully throws dirt back at your feet instead of sucking it up. The rods and hoses also come apart when you are using them. Overall this vacuum has a terrible design and is not worth the money. Buy a Shop-vac.

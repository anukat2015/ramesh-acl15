Title: DON'T BUY IT
Content:
This vaccuum cleaner was 300. from can tire where i purchased it.  it is a worthless, heavy piece of garbage that went through 8 belts in 1 week, it was not hard used. I returned the first one, can tire replaced it immediately, second one, same thing. After 1 month, twice a week vaccums it just stopped working.  Don't waste your money, this is the most irritating machine ever, and it wouldn't be a good deal if it were free.  I have never reviewed a product before, but this one is so bad, i thought i would try to spare others my grief.

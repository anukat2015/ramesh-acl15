Title: Finally - a decent coffee maker!!
Content:
I've always bought the cheap end of coffee makers (think $15 or less) because I really didn't think it would make a difference.  Boy was I wrong!  I stopped making coffee at home years ago because it wasn't as good as what I could get at a restaurant.  Recently I did some research on coffee makers and what made them good.  This Cuisinart met all of the criteria and then some.  It also made a Consumer Reports top list, so I decided to give it a try (price was good too).  I am so glad that I did.  It's one of the best things I've ever purchased for my kitchen.

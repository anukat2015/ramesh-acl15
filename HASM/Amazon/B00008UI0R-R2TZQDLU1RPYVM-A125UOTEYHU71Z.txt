Title: Exactly What We Wanted
Content:
I compared lots of vacs before I bought this one. We wanted a canister with a HEPA filter under $200. It does everything it says and more. The head goes flat for under the bed and detaches easily to get dust off the shelfs. It's a great vac for a great price.

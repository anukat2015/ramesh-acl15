Title: THE BEST SLR AND THE BEST LOOKING CAMERA I HAVE SEEN!
Content:
Before, I bought the E-300,I looked at the other SLR camera's and was impressed by some of them. But, not as impressed by the E-300. The E-300 caught my eye by it's looks and it's functions. Also, all things it can do! Plus it was easy to use! When I first started using the camera I was "VERY" impressed by how well the pictures were coming out. I am pretty impressed with the E-300! I am "GLAD" I choose this camera and I would not trade it in for anythings else.

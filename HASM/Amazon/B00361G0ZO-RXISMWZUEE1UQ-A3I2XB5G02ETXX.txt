Title: A big disappointment.
Content:
After a HP / COMPAQ this was my second laptop. I chose the Asus after analyzing each model offered on the website amazon.com. I have more than a hundred of good experiences with a hundred Asus motherboards since 1994 and never had problems with them.
But this laptop is very, unstable, and it was my biggest disappointment of my life with computers.
It freezes several times a day, warms like a hair Dryer. When loading Windows 7 already had blue screen and rebooted several times, whenever I try to use one of the configuration options it freezes, I've had to do dirty shut down the power button several times. And people know that it damages the file system.
It is unacceptable that Asus put a device on the market as unstable as this one. Mainly because it is a device that claims to be high-performance games.
When playing movies the display is not smooth, but run almost frame by frame.
On the site of amazom you can see that they advertise that the equipment is guaranteed worldwide. But this is not true, such a guarantee only works in countries that are part of Asus GSM. And I live in Brazil and my country is not part of GSM. However, they sell products and have offices here and support for other models.
On the product page on amazon.com it says the product is supported 24 hours a day. However, I contacted Asus for help to solve my problems, and that company told me to contact Amazon.com. They're throwing me from side to side.
Is unfortunate, not recommend to anyone. Be careful before purchasing, because not everything that is written here applies to the whole world.

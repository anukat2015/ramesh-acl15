Title: you've got to be kidding me...
Content:
I do not review things on Amazon, but I feel obligated to give this thing another 1 star rating.
I am a huge Apple fan.  I have an iPhone, iPod classic, and a MacBook, but this piece of garbage is beyond enraging.
How could they not have tested a product that is made to workout and run with on people who were actually WORKING OUT AND RUNNING WITH IT?!?!
My 2nd Gen Shuffle finally crapped out on me after what I considered to be a decent run of time.  After all, I'm reasonable; I'm not going to expect a tiny little machine that gets tossed around and sweat on and exposed to the elements to last forever.  When it finally died, I went and bought a 4th Gen Shuffle.  I was excited about the larger capacity and the ability to have more control of what you were listening to, but that excitement was short-lived.
Just like a 100 other reviews have already stated, once you start to sweat on the control box it goes haywire and your iPod is rendered virtually useless.  I just can't get over how they allowed this to happen.  A product designed for people who want to listen to music while they workout stops working when you start working out with it.  Unbelievable.  
I really hope they fix this.  A recall would be great news.

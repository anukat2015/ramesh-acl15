Title: Couldn't be happier
Content:
Upgraded from a 2GB Zune to the 16GB Nano 4G.  Yeah this is a huge upgrade.  The unit is very thin and light (thinner and lighter than the Zune 2GB).  I've pulled it off the desk a few times simply by turning my chair with the cord brushing against the arm, it's that light.  Good thing I have quick hands.  Tons of space for the size.  This is my travel player, I drop it in an armband and use it on motorcycle rides.  Spend $15 and get some nice earbuds and you are gtg.

Title: roadster review
Content:
I bought my Shark Roadster at Target.  It works just fine for me, has been durable, hasn't overheated, stays in the outlets just fine (except the outlets that are too loose in my apartment to keep anything in them).  The only problem is finding a replacement for the filter.  WOW. and YIKES!  Don't they sell them at Target, Walmart or anywhere handy like that?  Otherwise it has been a good vac......even picks up spiders which is great until you have to take them out of the filter. :)

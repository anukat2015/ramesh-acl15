Title: Super cleaning power but a few glitches in the design
Content:
My advice: Don't buy a bagless vacuum if you would rather not get up close & personal with your dust! After the weekly vacuuming, you have to clean the filter by smacking it inside a bag to get the dust out. But there are still big clumps of fuzz that have to be raked out of the pleats of the HEPA filter with a brush or your fingers. A very messy & unpleasant job! No matter how careful I am, the dust flies. If you are allergic to dust, plan on having someone else clean the filter or risk an asthma attack. But, it has tremendous suctioning power and really filters the exhaust air well, with no bad vacumm cleaner smells. Also, Dirt Devil has come out with a new Gortex HEPA filter that is washable to replace the paper filter that comes as standard equipment. My gripe: the handle to the dust recepticle is placed exactly where you intuitively reach to pick up the machine. The real carrying handle is located farther back. I know this, but I can't tell you how many times I've grabbed it, only to have the dust filter & all come off. Fortunately, it seldom dumps its contents.   It's about a 5 out of 10 on the quiet scale. Small, light & easy to store. All in all, I am pleased; especially since I got a great deal on the price.

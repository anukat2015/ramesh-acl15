Title: A solid digital SLR, but the original D70 offers better value
Content:
The new Nikon D70s digital SLR camera is a slight upgrade to the successful and popular D70 model. It retains the size and body construction of the D70, and also keeps all the features of the D70 that make the latter such a prized digital SLR, e.g.: same CCD sensor and DSP chip; instantaneous start-up; fast response, little shutter lag; industry-leading 1/500 flash sync (wow!); 3D color matrix metering; and the powerful i-TTL flash/lighting system. Like the D70, the D70s uses a CompactFlash memory card and is MicroDrive-compatible.
The D70s differs from the D70 in the following aspects:
- port for electronic cable release (MC-DC1)
- larger, 2.0" LCD (vs. D70's 1.8", but same resolution)
- slightly more powerful battery
To many Nikon diehard's disappointment, the D70s did not include more megapixels (unlike the Canon DR XT vs. DR) or a more powerful AF system, and kept D70's slow-poke USB 1.1 (a.k.a. "USB 2.0 full-speed") connection.
Since the D70s is just a minor upgrade, I strongly believe the D70 to be a much better value. You should go with the D70s only if you absolutely need the cable release feature.
Between the kit and the body-only versions, I highly recommend the kit version.  The kit 4x zoom lens is of excellent quality (especialy optics-wise) and is well worth the price differential.  It makes a great "street zoom" lens.

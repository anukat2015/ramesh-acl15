Title: Perfect balance between power and mobility.
Content:
I've been an owner for about 3 months now and I can tell you I am pretty impressed with this notebook.
Make no mistake, you pay for what you get.
This is for someone that is always on the go and do not want to buy a crappy netbook because the Z series is extremely light. The beauty is in the fact that this is also for someone who wants good processing power and video card performace. I was able to play Counter Strike with full 100 fps and tf2 in medium setting with 40+ fps (with the dedicated graphics card), wich is pretty amazing for a notebook that is this thin. Technology like Intel's Centrino 2 and the fact that you can change from discrete to integrated graphic card (with functions perfectly, by the way) makes it possible to use it, on the go, for six hours straight. I made this test with the standard baterry and the baterry life is awesome.
Some other things like integrated 3G and GPS receiver and the VAIO Care software, that from time to time does a full verification of your notebook and actualy makes it faster by cleaning useless files and the registry, makes this notebook simply perfect.

Title: BUY THIS VACUUM
Content:
Although this might seem pricey, it's worth every cent. The first time it was used the canister was filled from one room. That's how much filth was left by it's predacessor which cost about half of the Dyson. Had to buy bags too. I'm not a young man but I actually use this vac and I'm married. That says alot because i'm basicaly lazy. Buy it, you won't regret it. If you're not satisisfied I'll double your money (just kidding).

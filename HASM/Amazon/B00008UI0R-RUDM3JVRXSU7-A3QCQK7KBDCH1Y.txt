Title: Great little vacuum
Content:
The vacuum works great.  It picks up everything..  The two things I don't like is the filter and dust holder are too small.  I can only vacuum one room and have to empty it.  It is very messy to empty, the dust goes everywhere.  The other function I don't like is the floor dusting brush falls off the pole when I use it.  It doesn't stay on very well.  I would recommend this vacuum for carpets.

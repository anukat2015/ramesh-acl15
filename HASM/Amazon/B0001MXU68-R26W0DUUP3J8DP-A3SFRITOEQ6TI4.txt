Title: Good but not great.
Content:
Don't believe everything you read about these machines. They do make good coffee (if you use the right blend) and are reasonably well built. But, the coffee is not coffee house quality. It really is a matter of expectations. I believe the Melitta MES2 is the better choice of the many available in a comparative price range. All one shot coffee makers can leak, some are down right cheaply built and some are over priced, but this is a growing segment of the coffee market and can only improve. I was also amazed at the different filter styles which forces you to use only the maker's particular filter brand. However, you can get away with stuffing a pod from another brand into your MES2 and it will work. I strongly suggest that you visit www.podhead.com for an excellent, although more expensive, alternative to one:one brands of coffee. And, these great coffee blends are available in filters that fit the MES2. Over all, I am pleased with the performance of this machine and the price (with rebate) is very competitive. Just remember the basics, filtered cold water, a good coffee pod and a clean machine = an excellent cup of coffee.

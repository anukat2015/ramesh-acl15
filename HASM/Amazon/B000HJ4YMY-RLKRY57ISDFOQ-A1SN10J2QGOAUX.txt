Title: Nikon D80 Kit
Content:
For digital camera users wanting to upgrade from point and click to a relatively sophisticated SLR, the D80 makes the most sense.  At about 2/3 the price of the heavily advertised D90, the D80 delivers almost all the same features, except the built-in video capability. The user interface is pretty complex, but this is a complex piece of technology.  Two negatives are the sheer size of the beast with the big zoom lens, and the unnecessary image editing capability of the camera.  Who edits in camera?  That's what Photoshop is for.

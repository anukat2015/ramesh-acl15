Title: What a buy!
Content:
I've been working with a Dirt Devil vacuum for about 7 years now, it was a leftover from when I still lived at home.  But with a cat, a dog, and a neat freak boyfriend, I needed something new.  My pug Sophie sheds like crazy, and we have hair EVERYWHERE.  I decided to invest in a pet hair vac, and did a lot of research between the Dyson and the Bissell.  I brought home the Bissell, ready to take it back if it didn't perform.  And in the end, I have two words for this vacuum: FREAKIN AMAZING!  I vacuumed a rug that I had beaten and vaced that morning with my old machine, and nearly got a canister full of hair.  After going through my whole house, I managed to get about 4 canisters full.  The attachments are great for the couch and dining room seats.  It's heavy, so if you have shoulder issues, you might need a lighter vac.  But I wouldn't trade it out for anything else.

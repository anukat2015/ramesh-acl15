Title: Olympus E500 the perfect DSLR entry level.
Content:
I have previously owned several different long zoom compact consumer cameras.  I wanted to upgrade to higher quality images though, and the E500 with the two lens kit came in at the perfect price and weight point for me. I  don't want anything so heavy that it is a burden to haul around, and the two lens kit gives me 35mm equivalent range of 28mm to 300mm.   I immediatly fell in love with this camera, and can hardly put it down.  It is simple enought for a beginner, but has advanced features that will make a pro happy.  (I used to be a pro)- 
The most important thing when buying a camera is how it "fits you", but the E-500 has great ergonomics and speed, is easy to learn and provides outstanding quality.  You can see  some photos that I took on my very first day out with this camera, at

If there is any knock at all, it is that the kit zoom lenses perform better at least one F-stop down from wide open.  But that isn't really a knock, as that is true of most lenses, especially the lower prices ones.

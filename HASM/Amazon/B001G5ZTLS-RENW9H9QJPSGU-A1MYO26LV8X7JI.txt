Title: Finally a DSLR that perform as good as Film SLRs with long exposure
Content:
I used to own Nikon FM10 35mm film SLR, I enjoyed shooting long exposure shots at night in city areas, when I switched to DSLR, the first one was Canon EOS Rebel XT, I tried the same night long exposure and the photos always have lot of grainy red dots, no matter how much the ISO is low and different size aperture.
Then I bought Canon 40D, and I got the same problem, I even tried Nikon D90, the red dots were reduced, but still very noticeable. The exposure time was always less than 30 seconds, but the shooting was always in the city night, were there are always light pollution.
Finally I got the 5D Mark II, and I did few testing and the red dots were very minimal, my friend gave me a tip, to disable the long exposure comp in the camera, which is the opposite of what someone should do, but that did the trick, the shots looked much better and cleaner. This is truly an amazing sensor, that can match the 35mm film quality.

Title: Satisfied with Apple iPod 8Gb purchase
Content:
Everything great. Though, I wish Apple would bring down the high costs and requirements. For example, in order for this iPod to work, I had to spend over $300 to upgrade my operating system and install more RAM memory. If I would have known this, I wouldn't have bought it. Way to squeaze the juice out of us poor little turnips Apple. Help the little people. But, very nice equipment. If you can afford it.

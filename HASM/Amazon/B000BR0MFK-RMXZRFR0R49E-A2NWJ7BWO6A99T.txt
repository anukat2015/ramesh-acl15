Title: I love my Nano
Content:
I love this little Nano.
I opted for the teal/blue color and it's beautiful.
The screen quality is amazing, everytime I turn it on I am still in aww over how such a tiny picture can look so good.
The sound is also great, no complaints there either!
I have downloaded a few games to it and have really enjoyed them. It sure makes sitting in a waiting room a lot more fun.
I honestly don't think I have a single "con" to post about this Nano, I LOVE it!

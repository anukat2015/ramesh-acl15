Title: Fantastic brewer! My parents love it! Fast, easy, great coffee!
Content:
My father LOVES coffee, but he hates making a pot for just him or for him and my mom.  I searched, read reviews until I decided on this one for him for Christmas. I purchased this Keurig along with the extra filter A MUST!..(It makes it possible to use your own coffee), k-cup holder, and boxes of decaf k-cups. They LOVE IT!!  It was a hit on Christmas with everyone but my parents tell me they now have a perfectly brewed cup of coffee for in the morning, before bed...any time in seconds! It's extremely easy to use and built very well.  I also liked the feature of this model that you could use different size coffee mugs/cups.

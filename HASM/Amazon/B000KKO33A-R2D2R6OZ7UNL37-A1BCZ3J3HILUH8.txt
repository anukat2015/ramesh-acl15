Title: Great heat, but pricey fuel.
Content:
I use this heater in my basement/workshop. Turning the unit on is an easy straight forward process, although the siphon pump supplied to fill it with kerosene works just a little under par. This little heater produces an amazing amount of heat, and usually runs between 6 and 9 hours on a full tank. Most of the reviews on Amazon are quite accurate. There isn't much adjustment in flame(just right or wrong), it will occasionally set off my smoke detectors(but there is no visible smoke), the handle is a little on the flimsy side(especially when full of fuel), and finding K-1 grade kerosene can at times be a bit troublesome. Two and a half gallons of kerosene costs about $13.00 at the local hardware store. I wouldn't put this heater in the ultra efficient category, but I believe most of the future buyers of this unit will find it a good value based on its purchase price, and the amount of clean heat it produces.

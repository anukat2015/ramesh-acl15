Title: Excellent!
Content:
This is an excellent coffee maker, for an unbelievably low price - I bought mine at Lowe's for $49.99.  CONE filters produce better tasting coffee AND use less coffee to do it.  The thermal pot keeps the coffee HOT for several hours. 
YES, you have to put the pot in the right place.  Gee, it really isn't difficult.
I bought a Mr. Coffee first, similar style and the caraffe was impossible to open.  Also the basket filter used so much coffee it seemed wasteful.  THIS coffee maker is great!!

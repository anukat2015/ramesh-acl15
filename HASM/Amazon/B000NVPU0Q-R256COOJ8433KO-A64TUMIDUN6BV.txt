Title: The perfect Air Conditioner for me
Content:
With the summer in full swing and the temperature reaching the 90's on certain days I decided that my window fan was no longer going to cut it and an air conditioner was absolutely necessary to stay comfortable in my room during the days and nights.  I spent a little time looking at air conditioners on websites and decided to try out the Haier ESA3067 6,000-BTU one mainly because it was on sale at Target for $149.99.  I headed off to Target and within 30 minutes I was back home with my air conditioner.  After reading through the owners manual I hooked the baby up and turned it on.  Within an hour my room cooled from the high 80's to the mid 70's, pretty good in my opinion (12'x11' room).  Over the past few days I've been running it non stop and it's been performing like a champ.  During the night I can run it without worrying about waking up from the air conditioner being too loud from the compressor turning on or off.  The unit comes with a remote which is convenient.  The unit itself has some nice features such as a timer function to turn on/off the air conditioner, 3 fan speeds and 4 modes (fan, cool, energy eff., and dehumidify).  All things considered when compared to other air conditioners with similar features this baby rocks, I'm definitely happy with my purchase and would do it again in a heart beat.  The only thing I regret is not purchasing it earlier in the summer.

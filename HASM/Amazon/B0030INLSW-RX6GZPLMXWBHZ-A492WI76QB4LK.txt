Title: customer service
Content:
I had to return this laptop because I didn't receive adequate customer service. 
First, locating where to call, second, although the first group of technical advisers couldn't solve the problem, my case was given to the senior technical advisers who were to call me the next day. After 3 or 4 days I had not heard from the senior technical adviser I returned the laptop to Amazon. The following day I received the call.
I think that nothing was wrong with the computer, but there is a problem with customer service.
The problem I had was setting up the wireless connection.

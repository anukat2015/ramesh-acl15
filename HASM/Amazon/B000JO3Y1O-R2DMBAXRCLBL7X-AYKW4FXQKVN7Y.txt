Title: The best iPod Ever!
Content:
I had this iPod for almost two years (until it got stolen). I always have wanted an iPhone, and this came very close. I love its style and how it combines music, internet, and fun apps. This is a huge recomendation to anyone who wants an iPhone but can't get one due to stupid AT&T. I miss it a lot.

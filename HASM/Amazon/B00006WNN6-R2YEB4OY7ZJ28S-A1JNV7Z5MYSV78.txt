Title: You can't turn off the power, and user manual is worthless
Content:
I do not recommend this heater. It is quiet, but that reflects a weak fan resulting in poor airflow. The user manual is full of errors. For example, it states that the left knob has 4 settings; fan, 2, 1 and zero. In reality, it has 3 settings; 2, 1 and a little "dot". User manual says that you turn the left knob to zero to turn off the heater. But there is no zero on the knob -- and you CANNOT turn power off without unplugging the heater (or switching off current to the socket, if it's a switch-controlled socket). Pretty annoying to have to crawl around behind furniture every morning & night. Why not just leave it on? Well, if the power remains on, the red light at the front is lit, and it is VERY bright in a dark room - hey, if you want a nightlight, buy this fire! Also, I don't much like the idea of leaving my house with a 1500 watt fire ready to turn itself on at any moment (if the temperature falls low enough). And don't even think about contacting DeLonghi customer service. They will just tell you that "it is the correct user manual", despite my sending them photos of the fire to prove that the manual is choc-full of mistakes. Useless. I went to Target, bought a small "Warm Fusion" ceramic heater for $9.99 (on sale) - it is FAR superior - much warmer, and hey, you can turn the darn thing OFF !!

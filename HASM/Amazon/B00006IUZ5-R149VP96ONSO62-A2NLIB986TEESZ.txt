Title: Best Wedding Present We Received
Content:
Of all of them, this was the most useful. Put in the water, press the button, and voila, hot water! I'm about to get shipped upstairs at work and won't be near the microwave to fix my oatmeal any longer; I'm planning to get another of these for my new cubicle. Also good for cup of soup, hot cocoa, tea, etc. By the way, our fifteen year old Hot Shot is STILL working just fine.

Title: Avoid this Ipod, defective earphones
Content:
Avoid this Shuffle, the earphones are really terrible. Most of us go for the small ipod so it doesn't weigh too much while we are working out. The controls are on the wire on the right ear phone wire. If you sweat on it, the controls get mest up and you can no longer lower the volume. I had to exchange the earphones for new ones because the first pair did not work. After a few workouts with the second pair of earphones the volume control got stuck again!! I hate these new ipod ear phones! Dont buy!

Title: Space Heater
Content:
We bought this heater to replace a Pelonis heater that broke. This heater works fairly well to heat the bathroom, but doesn't heat the space as fast as the Pelonis. The only thing we find odd about this heater is the dial to turn it on; you have to push the dial down to turn the fan on. It is awkward until you get the hang of it. We much preferred the buttons on the Pelonis.

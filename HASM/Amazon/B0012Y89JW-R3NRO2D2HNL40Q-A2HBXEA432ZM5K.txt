Title: Great  camera at a fair price...
Content:
Bought this camera to replace my Nikon D70. I've been a Nikon user for years however my D70 was starting to do strange things including reformatting the memory card at will! I bought the camera after reading the review on dpreview. Took the Canon to Scandinavia, taking about 2,500 shots via a Sigma 18-200mm OS lens(I wish canon would produce such a lens however the results with the Sigma were excellent). This is a feature loaded camera which will appeal to the amateur and prosumer as well. The menus are excellent, very intuitive compared to the D70. Highly recommended.

Title: the perfect vacuum for me
Content:
I love this vacuum. I have all hardwood floors and was using a broom for a while. I decided a vacuum would keep the dust down better. This was a great choice. It picks up everything I need it to pick up, empties easily and isn't so bulky to store. 
I don't have a pet or young children living in the house, so I can't offer an opinion on how it picks pu pet hair, cheerios and such. :)
While I do agree with the reviewers who wish it had a longer cord, I'm still giving it 5-stars.

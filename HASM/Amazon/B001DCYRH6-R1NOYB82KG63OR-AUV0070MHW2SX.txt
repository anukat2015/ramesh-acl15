Title: A Serious New Flaw, But Still a Good Vacuum
Content:
I have owned and used three of these vacuums in my business over the last 25 years and have always loved them.  Good Price, Great Suction, Small, Easy to Use, etc.  I can echo all of the other user comments in that this is a great vacuum.
But, they changed one thing on the most recent vacuum I bought that I just hate.  They made the hose a short springy thing instead of a longer non-springy deal.  So, when you set the vacuum down and start using it to clean up, and pull on the hose to extend it, it yanks on the vacuum, even banging it into things or dragging it around.  No more setting the vacuum on a ladder to clean something higher up, or setting it on stairs; it would tumble down in an instant.  And the hose is so short that you are always pulling on the vacuum with it.  I took my old vacuum hose and put it on the new vacuum.  Hopefully I won't accidentally step on it and crush it as I have done before, since now I can't replace it except with the new springy one.
I called Hoover to complain and ask if the old hose was available.  Answer - no.  So, as much as I like this vacuum, it is a bit of a deal breaker in ever buying another one, unless I want to spend the time trying to find an older hose or some other hose that would fit it, or making one on my own somehow.  The Hoover rep seemed unsympathetic to my problem and offered nothing - just what I expected with the way customer service is these days.
As an aside, I bought this on Amazon at a great price, and know I could send it back, but did not.  I really love Amazon pricing and service that I have that option.
So, keep this new change in mind in deciding whether to buy an otherwise great vacuum.

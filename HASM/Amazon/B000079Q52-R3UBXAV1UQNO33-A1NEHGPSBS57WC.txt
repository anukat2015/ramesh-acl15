Title: Buying this one. Again.
Content:
I really like this and my cats absolutely love it. I end up with a string of cats littering the floor in the direction that this is pointing. If you're pointing the (very bright) thing at yourself, you get nice and toasty (5 stars for toasty and energy efficiency), however this unit did not do a great job of heating the whole room unless I left it on for a very long time (3 stars for heating a whole room). Last of all, I'm buying a second one because my first one kicked itself off and won't go on again. It's about two years old which isn't so bad but I do like things that last (3 stars for staying power).

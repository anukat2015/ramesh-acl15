Title: It is a whole lot of laptop
Content:
This thing is fully loaded.  Really.  I got it with an after market Intel 80GB SSD and swapped out one of the dual 340GB 7200 Seagates.  Very responsive, high powered and the screen is great.
For the money, nothing comes close, plus that 2 year global warranty.  There is a lot of bloatware pre-installed, but this seems to be very typical.  I'm still tidying some of it up but I'm very happy already with where it is.  I would buy this again with absolutely no regrets.

Title: don't waste your money.....
Content:
I bought this item 2 years ago....banana yellow with the toaster to match.  Very heavy, looked very sturdy and I thought this would be the coffemaker I would have for years.   We make coffee only once a day, on most days of the week.  The heating element pooped out 6 months after our purchase.  O.K., the company made good and sent us another one, it was under warranty.  It lasted 1 year of light use, and the heating element went out on us again.....lukewarm coffee, and the enamel paint was peeling just above the hot plate.  It bubbled up and flaked off in big pieces to reveal the bare metal beneath it.  I am very disappointed to have spent $130. + dollars on this item.  Last week we bought a new coffemaker for $69., and I threw the other one out.  Don't waste your money......2 coffemakers and the element went on both of them.  I only hope our toaster lasts......

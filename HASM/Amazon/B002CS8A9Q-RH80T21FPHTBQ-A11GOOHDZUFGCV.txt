Title: Love the Hourglass Coffee Maker!
Content:
I bought this maker a few months ago and absolutely love it. I have missed drinking coffee due to my acid reflux and the Hourglass makes low acid coffee which I love and it's the only way I can drink coffee. I have used other cold brew makers but they are so complicated and messy I stopped using them after a month or so. The Hourglass is easy to use, easy to clean and allows me to re-enjoy coffee again. 
I drink the cold brew hot (by adding hot water) but my daughter loves the iced coffee she can make. It's very versatile and I love the comments I get when people come over and see a giant hourglass on my counter. 
Try this coffee maker!

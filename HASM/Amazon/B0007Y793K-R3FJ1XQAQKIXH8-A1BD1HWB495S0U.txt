Title: Do we really need the Mark III?
Content:
I have to say that the Mark III for $1000 to $2000 more may not offer that much for the money.  I have had the 1D Mark II N for a year and have truly enjoyed the flexibility of this PRO camera.  To date, after 1000's of pics taken, I still have no sensor dust.  
Other than the 1Ds Mark II and its 16 MP, this camera can to everything a pro or pro-amateur photographer will need.
It's truly a beauty and certainly fast enough to get any shot necessary.

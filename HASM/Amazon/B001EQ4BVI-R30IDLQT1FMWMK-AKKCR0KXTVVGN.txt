Title: Great Camera!
Content:
This review is for the beginner/hobbiest to the advanced amateur...this is simply a wonderful camera.  
The 50D is very intuitive, not the least bit indimidating, and surprisingly easy to use considering the more advanced features Canon has put into it.  I have not spent a lot of time learning all that this camera can do yet, but I am encouraged by the camera and it practically asks you do learn more about it...it wants you to take great pictures.  I have always shot with a Canon, but this is my first DSLR (film die hard till the end) and I have been thrilled.  
I left for a vacation in Curacao 3 days after opening the box so I had to learn on the fly (literally on the flight) and I was amazed how quickly the camera felt like I had owned it for years.  I also discovered how addictive shooting digital can be (8GB minimum is a must) so I just the let the shutter burn and ended up taking over 1000 photos over 8 days.  
On the coastline I put the camera in continuous mode and the high burst rate practically gave me video of the waves crashing into the shore when you view the photos in rapid succession.  This camera was a lot of fun...it makes you want to do more because it can.  
Feel free to check out some of my photos in the customer images page.  I do not have the technical knowledge or skills of some of the other reviewers which seems to be an advantage to me.  This seems like it will be a great camera to continue to develop my skills with.  
I have been very pleased with my purchase and I am confident anyone else would be too.

Title: Its ROCKS !!!!!!
Content:
This thing is awesome I dont know who gave is a 1 star this deserves a 6~stars for the price~ so easy to use works perfect !!!!
In the last 3 days it payed for its self :)) 2 cups a day with tip is 33.00 that adds up. This makes a better white choc mocha than "star bucks!!! So happy with it its very nice. Read the direction and you should have no problem with the seals!  Treat it carefully and take care of it, and it is the real deal and it wasnt 700.00
or 500.00 or 300.00 or even a 100.00~It was 29.00 "it does the job very well" I give it 5 stars ! I thought enough about it to come and write a review in its favor ~Its more than I ever hoped for for the price
I recommend it :))

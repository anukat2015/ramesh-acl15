Title: Big leap forward that needs another iteration; prepare for serious photography
Content:
I've been using point and shoot cameras, favoring a Canon superzoom for the past two years.  I bought the PEN looking to upgrade to something that would give crisper, better focused images and still be highly portable for travel.  I read all the reviews in detail and thought the design looked cool. 
So far I've had it for a few days and taken about 50 shots.  There are a few MAJOR issues to consider before you buy this camera:
- OK it's smaller than a SLR but that's still heavier than a point & shoot.  In fact it is so dense, I really have to use two hands all the time and I keep worrying I'll drop it.  If this thing falls off the bed, it's going to either smash into pieces or break my toe.
- the lens cap has to be taken on and off EVERY time you start up.  How long til I lose that?  There's no spare or way to protect the lens without a cap.  With my superzoom, I tethered the sole cap to my straps, but that does not work so well on a camera with interchangeable lenses.
- there's no viewfinder and no flash.  You can buy them each separately but that gives you more widgets to carry around.  It is MUCH less convenient than a superzoom.
- you really need to understand photography (aperture ratio, shutter speed, etc.) to use this camera.  The auto-focus does not work in low light.  You can't rely on Auto; it seems like I can often get better images by twiddling with settings.
- the free software that comes with it for adjusting RAW is aimed at power users
- the loops where the straps attach are stylish but annoying since they have these metal clips that do not rotate at all; the straps keep getting tangled and the metal loops stick out and catch on things.  
- there is no custom bag for this camera, but it has a novel form factor since you want to carry two lenses along with a smallish body
Now for the good news:  the crispness of image is superb!  If I can manage to bring this along without breaking it, and if I can manage to learn photography while I am on vacation, then by the end of vacation I may have some gem photos.
In short, while this camera looks like a point and shoot with an SLR-style sensor, in fact it is really more of an SLR camera crammed into a tight package.  It's best suited for camera buffs who will deeply appreciate its size and high-quality images.
In the next iteration, Olympus should add a better place for your thumb to hold when using it one-handed, fix the straps, add a tiny flash, and upgrade the ease of use of the Autofocus.  
I am looking forward to learning more about photography and hopefully getting some amazing shots with this camera.  Just bear in mind the Olympus PEN is going to demand special handling and a major learning curve, if you are used to a point-and-shoot digital camera.

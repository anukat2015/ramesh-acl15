Title: Good and bad at the same time
Content:
I love the 80gb Ipod classic. For me everything works perfectly. Except for one thing, most older addon devices are incompatible. I bought a cable to use for video that doesn't work with this ipod and now have to pay another $50 for a cable to hook it up to my tv, made me pretty upset. also i use windows 2000 which does not support the latest version of itunes so i cannot use itunes with it and had to download floola or yamipod for it. the device itself is great, click wheel works perfectly, movies look great and hard drive size is awesome. so far my battery life has been good and i have really enjoyed the device. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is for the hassle i had not being able to use itunes or my video cable.

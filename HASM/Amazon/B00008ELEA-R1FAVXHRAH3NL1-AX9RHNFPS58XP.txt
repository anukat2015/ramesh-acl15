Title: Great Coffee, But...
Content:
I had forgotten how much better percolated coffee tastes compared to drip. Even after sitting in the pot for an hour, the coffee still tastes fresh. After an hour in the drip coffee makers, the coffee was bitter and murky. Not so with the percolator. We use less coffee per pot and less is dumped out due to being old. This pot takes up much less space on the counter, too.We have only been using this 8-cup percolator for a little over a week, so I can't write about the longevity. The only reason I didn't order the 12-cup programmable one is because of all the reviews saying it quits working after a few months. I am hoping this one holds up better. Even if it does konk out after a few months, I'll still buy another percolator.Added: It konked out after 6 months. Back to the drawing board.

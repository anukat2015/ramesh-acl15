Title: Warranty Worthless - Customer Support Terrible
Content:
After five months my G60-230US LCD screen went bad.  Vertical and horizontal lines on the screen.  When I sent it back to HP for my warranty they said the damage was my fault and would cost me $435.00 dollars to fix.  By looking at other web posts I have found out that this is the standard response to anything you want fixed by your warranty.  If you buy an HP just remember your warranty is worthless.  If you notice when you open this laptop the LCD screen is very flimsy.  This seems to be a terrible engineering design.  Maybe this is what led to the LCD screen going bad.  It appears to me that the LCD could easily be damaged under normal use which happened evidently to me.  The reason HP computers cost less than other brands is because they evidently don't have to support there warrranty or pay much for there engineering.

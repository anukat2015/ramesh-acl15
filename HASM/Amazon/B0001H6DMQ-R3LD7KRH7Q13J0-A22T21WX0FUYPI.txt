Title: Very happy, a powerful vacuum, perfect for carpets specially if you have pets
Content:
Performance and price wise I believe this hoover is a good deal. Here is just a short outline of my personal experience with it so far.
Pros
- i am very happy with the suction power
- rotating brush motion is perfect for vacuuming my carpet, and since I have a little puppy, crucially enough it picks up all the tiny bits of hair
- i've had the hoover for  just over a month and have probably used it three times by now. Suction is still great and I haven't emptied the dust canister yet.... pretty good, as far as I'm concerned
Cons
- the weight of the vacuum is manageable (i'm 5'4''), especially since it's a canister one rather than upright one. But no, it's not as light as feather.
- only major thing i would change is the fact that the brush attachment doesn't move relative to the handle, so going around corners needs a bit more effort.
Overall I'd definitely recommend this one!

Title: Useless
Content:
I don't think I've ever purchased an item that is so totally useless.  The heat it puts out is anemic on both settings, and the fan would not blow out a candle.  The only way to get warm with this thing would be to put it on your lap and wrap a blanket around you.  The worst thing is that the controls are terrible, and the light stays on no matter whether it is running or not, which I guess is good as there is no 'off' position.  The only way to make sure it's off is to unplug it.

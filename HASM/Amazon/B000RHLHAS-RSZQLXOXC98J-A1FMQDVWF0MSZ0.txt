Title: Only works for a few months, then.... dead.
Content:
The first one I had worked well for two winters (in AZ- where we didn't need a lot of heat, so it was used sporadically over a 60 day winter!).  We moved to Indiana and it worked for only a few months more, and one day I woke up with the heater turned off and it never worked again-died in the middle of the night.  I decided to try the Honeywell again because I loved the thermostat feature, and bought two more- one for my room and one for my infant daughter's room.  They worked great for about 2 months and BOTH did the same thing as the first, died in the middle of the night. (We tested different outlets and they still didn't work, and other items have been plugged into these outlets and had no problem, so I know it's not an outlet issue!)  It starts out working great, and I've never had the thermostat issue that you'll read about in other reviews, HOWEVER, after about a month I notice that it isn't running as smooth and the fan makes a strange noise, like it is straining to work.  Then, after a few weeks straining motor noise, DEAD.  The same thing has happened with three of these heaters, what a disappointment.  Thought the first one was a lemon but the second two dying within weeks of each other proves that this product is unreliable and NOT BUILT TO LAST. Save your money and buy something else!  Honeywell customer service is worthless also, they were of no help. Thankfully I had purchased the last 2 at Target and I was within the 3 month return period when they broke.

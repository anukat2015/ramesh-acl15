Title: Not for very cold weather
Content:
Pros: Quiet operation, cheap, stylish.
Cons: You cannot run on high heat, heat sensor shut down and never come back. the problem is sensor is too close to heating coil, it take time to cool down. even your room is chilly cold, heater is still off. Ridiculous.

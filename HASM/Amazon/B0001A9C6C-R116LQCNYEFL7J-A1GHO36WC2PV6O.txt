Title: this is great
Content:
well, i just got the pink ipod mini yesterday for christmas and i was SO happy because nowadays it seems like EVERYONE has this popular item. i could not b happier with this product. i have read many of the other reviews on this item and i haven't run into any of the problems that alot of the peopls have. i could not b happier with this ipod. I thought that it might not be enough room for all of my songs, but it definetly is, as i dont NEED all my songs on my ipod because i would never listen to them all at once, and my tastes change often. So i would recemend this to ANYBODY and EVERYBODY!! I LOVE IT!!

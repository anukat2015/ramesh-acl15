Title: Zune Is In...Bye, Bye Apple..Microsoft is on the money!!!
Content:
I just traded in my 8gb zune for a 16gb and I love every minute of it. This product is completely flawless and the quality of the product is absolutely beautiful. The features are incredible and the video quality is phenomenal on here. If you love music of all types and you are on the go...upgrade to a 80gb to get the best of this product, but my zune gets the job done with space to spare!!! I highly recommend this product to anyone that loves mp3 players and this is the definite one to buy and microsoft is always the best in the business with electronics of any kind. I had a Samsung YH-925 and Samsung T9 and they were okay until they just stopped working and then just when the new zune was released. I grabbed late that night at 430am in the morning haha :). I love everything on this Zune and just check out the other reviews and you will see its the best MP3 player on the market!!!!

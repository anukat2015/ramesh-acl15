Title: DO NOT BUY!
Content:
Please do not buy this coffee maker.  I have gone through three in one year.  It always seems to stop working.  Twice it was the self cleaning during the brewing cycle, then the water would not circulate.  It looks nice, but do not be deceived it consistantly fails.  The longest period with no break downs was five months of everyday use.   I personally will never buy a cuisinart coffeemaker again.   I have another friend who purchased a more expensive model and she was quite dissapointed as well.  BEWARE!

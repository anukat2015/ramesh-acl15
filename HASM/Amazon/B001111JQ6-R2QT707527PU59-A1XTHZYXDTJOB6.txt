Title: Good Coffee but poor quality makers
Content:
This model makes good coffee and the thermal carafe keeps it hot for hours without cooking or burning the coffee.  However, the unit is manufactured with cheap parts and will not last more than two years.  There is an aluminum heating tube in the base of the unit that will corrode and start leaking.  Besides creating a mess if you set it up on the timer overnight, there are also electrical circuits in the base that could short out.  I contacted Cuisinart after my first unit failed and they promptly sent me a new one, but now that one has developed the same problem (2 units in less than four years).  I also know people that had the same problem with the Grind-N-Brew models.  Avoid the headaches and by avoiding this brand.

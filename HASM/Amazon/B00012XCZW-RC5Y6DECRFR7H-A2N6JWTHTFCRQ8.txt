Title: Very fast and makes delicious coffee
Content:
I researched several coffeemakers online before selecting this one.  I took the recommendations from many customers and bought my filters at Wal-Mart at 97 cents a box.  I buy my coffee specially ground (espresso) from an online source and have home delivery every 6 weeks.  I wondered if this fine ground would make the coffee spill over into the carafe like some suggested might occur, but so far it has not happened.  I'm very happy with this purchase and whenever I mention to my friends that I now own a Bunn coffeemaker, they have nothing but glowing remarks to add about the length of service and the quality of coffee I'll now enjoy for years to come.

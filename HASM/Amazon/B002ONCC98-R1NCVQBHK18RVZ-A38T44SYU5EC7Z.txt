Title: 'KUDOS' to HP TECH SUPPORT
Content:
This is my 3rd HP laptop.  I was  hesitant in buying this after reading many terrible reviews about HP Tech Support.  I had occasion to have to contact them in regard to a graphic problem with my HP G71-340.  I reached a wonderful young man, Ashis, who is in India.  I am a 70 yr old woman &  have never received such 'royal' treatment from anyone as I did with him.  With 2 phone calls,  my initial call, and he called me back the next day, my graphic problem was fixed.  Not only that, but he  optimized some other features that I didn't even know needed it.  
  It is difficult for most people like myself to keep up with typing, holding the phone and following instructions.  However, Ashis was most repectful & patient with me.
Now my laptop is better than I thought it could be.  I am truly thrilled with it & especially with my experience with HP Tech Support.  I hope   someone at HP reads this and gives special commendations to Ahis in Darjeelig India.
P.S. I even had an arm chair (desk chair) tour of his location with the map he forwarded to me.  It is most beautiful. No wonder he so perfect.  Thank You

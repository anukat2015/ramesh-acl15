Title: Dont buy it!
Content:
This is what i encountered. I bought it in a store not amazon. First the wireless modem stopped working. Then the whole thing just stopped working. The store sent it to HP and they replaced it in a week or so. So I was like ok (probably bc I was paying it on credit, with insurance on it). The new one that I have is very slow, dunno why, cleaned it, anti virus, spyware, spyware, registry, scandisk, defrag, everything done and still. And the mouse just goes crazy all over the place. Another thing it just overheats alot! My wife has a Dell and I call it "Rambo" its being thru some much stuff, its missing chunks of it, even went on a deployment to Iraq and is still good! No more HP for me (dissapointed, I thought HP was the top of the line)

Title: I was cheated with this item.
Content:
I bought one of these just one year and 4 months ago and it cost me $ 970 by those days, and guess what? ---It is already damaged---. I do not recommend this brand to anyone. Since the purchase I noticed that it used to heated being a long time on, I thought it was normal, but everybody told me that should not be so. With the time the problem was getting worse. And a few days ago began to warm up faster and also shut down very fast until it rises to just turn it on and off immediately.
PD.: My language is spanish. I tried to do my best translating mi words to english.

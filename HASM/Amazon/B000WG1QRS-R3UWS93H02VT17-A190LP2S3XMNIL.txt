Title: i love my new toy
Content:
I just got my zune red 4 gig thang. I have never had any mp3 player. Rather a late convert to such gadgets. I must say this toy is everything i hoped it would be with a few happy surprises. I went with Zune since for better or worse i am married to Mr. Bills microsoft land on my new Dell laptop. All my music is loaded into windows media player. I hoped that this would make syncing my existing media data easy and I am pleased to report that this is truely the case. Its very easy to set up, sync and use within a short easy to follow download. My music loaded no problems and even my entire picture portfolio. I set my own skin. In the zune marketplace I found a bunch of free podcasts on topics that are of great interest to me that I did not know even existed. Anyways if you are a windows user and are wondering which way to do I would reccomend this product.

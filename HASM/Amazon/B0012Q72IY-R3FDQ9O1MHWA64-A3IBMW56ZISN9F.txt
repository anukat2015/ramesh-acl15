Title: Severe underexposure at all settings!
Content:
I just couldn't believe that a Pentax camera could be this bad and waited far too long to complain.  I have wasted far too much time trying to get exposures right only to find that the pictures are way too underexposed at all the different settings attempted.  I periodically get a decent picture if I crank up the ISO to a ridiculouly high 1600 for an average sunny day or use a 5.6 and a very slow shutter speed.  So, what am I going to do?  At this late date, buy a Nikon or a Canon and forget this disaster ever happened.

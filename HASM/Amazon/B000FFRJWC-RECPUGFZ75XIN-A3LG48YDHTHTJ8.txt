Title: Poor quality vacuum
Content:
If you are shopping for a vacuum, I DO NOT recommend the Eureka Uno.  The main problem with the UNO is that it has a feature called "edge kleaner." Due to this feauture is has a plastic piece that snaps onto the rollerbrush.  When you vacuum, this plastic piece gets hot and slowly melts over time.  Eventually, the melted plastic prevents the roller brush from turning.  When this happens, you have to buy a new roller brush and the part costs $30.  When I went into the vacuum shop to buy a new roller brush, there were a half dozen other UNOs sitting there with the same exact problem.  In total, I spent $160 on a vacuum that lasted for less than two years.  Needless to say, I'm very disappointed with the UNO and recommend that you look for a different vacuum.  It worked very well at first but just didn't hold up in the long run.  When I bought my new vacuum, I specifically looked for one that had all steel parts on the roller brush.  I'm writing this lenghty review to try and prevent others out there from wasting money on a "sub-par" product.

Not only was Amazon's price cheaper than anyone else, they shipped FREE, something those of us living in Hawaii cherish. Shipping often exceeds the cost of the item itself.
I have polished concrete floors and needed a canister with power and mobility, and this one has it. The tools could be a little better but overall, for vacuuming lampshades, tabletops, louvered doors and bamboo shades it is everything I'd long been searching for. The pet hair rotary brush works wonderfully on pet hair, better than any other I have owned. I do not have carpets but since the wide bare floor brush nearly tore a throw rug apart, I can understand people's joy over the powered carpet tool.
One caveat though...I had central vacuum in my previous home and was used to dropping the hose with tools attached wherever, but this model has controls and electronics in the wand, so it took me a bit to get used to the idea I had to treat it gently. But what an GREAT idea...no bending down to turn the vacuum on or off, or to change suction speeds.

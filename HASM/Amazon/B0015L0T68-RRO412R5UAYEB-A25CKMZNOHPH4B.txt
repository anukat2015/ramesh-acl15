Title: Sans Fuze 4 GB player - terrific!
Content:
Purch'd the Fuze after loading tunes into one I bought for a lady friend - wished I had one then.  I had been rotating my Sansa E200 player between car and house - got tired of that.  After using the Sansa E200, which is OK, the Fuze is alot easier to use.  I like the controls so much more.  This one will go into my car.

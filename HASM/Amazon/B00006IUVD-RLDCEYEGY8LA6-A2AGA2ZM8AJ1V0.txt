Title: If I could rate it no stars I would!
Content:
I had purchased one of these a few years back and loved it! It was perfect for morning coffee/tea while getting ready for work each day! It broke after a few years so I replaced it. I assumed that the quality would be the same as teh first one. I used the new one for less than two weeks when it broke. The button that is supposed to be pressed down to begin the the unit didn't engage and thus nothing! I gave it to my handyman to try and fix and he said it was a goner. Needless to say I'm unhappy with this product. I've bought something else to replace it. Too bad they didn't make this one like the last one.

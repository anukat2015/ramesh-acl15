Title: OK heater
Content:
good heater ...NOT UL certified.(this is big in my opinion almost returned it)... not for living space ... in an area where the noise from the fan wont bother you... also the cord/plug gets warm instructions says its normal but ive used other heaters and that doesnt happen. noise from fan gets worse if you lay it down on its side... also this is all on hardwood floors so if you have carpet it may reduce the sound.

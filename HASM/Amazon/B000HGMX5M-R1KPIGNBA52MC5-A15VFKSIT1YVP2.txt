Title: Pretty cool
Content:
I bought this camera to replace my D100 body.  This is a little lighter but is much more capable.  I can actually select ASA100.  There are more focusing regions, actually focuses faster is what I have noticed.  Haven't really tried it out as much as I want but from what picture taking I have done, it is already much better.

Title: Handy and a Great Cleaning Tool
Content:
I have 25 cats and ceramic tile flooring.  This product works great to mop the floors.  It gets the fur and other cat problems clean.   The tile sparkles after cleaning.  And the water that this product picks up is just plain dirty.  It's a joy to dump the stuff down the drain.  Also, it is not a chore to use this product.  It is light weight, easy to maneuver, and scrubs and picks up the dirty water in one pass over.  However, do remember to prop safely when you're changing water as it will fall easily, but this is because it is not heavy weight: which is a good thing.

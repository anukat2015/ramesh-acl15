Title: displeased with product
Content:
I'm not happy with the way the cleaner works on hard floors. It's ok as far as carpeting is concerned, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, quite frankly. It's also my first experience with a cannister, and it's very messy. I had considered retuning the item but it wasn't worth the effort. The only good feature, is that I can clean under my bed, which I couldn't do with a stand-up. I still use my stand-up to clean the hardwood floors. I guess I'll have to live with it, but I think I could have done better for much less money. I won't buy anything over @20 again from Amazon.

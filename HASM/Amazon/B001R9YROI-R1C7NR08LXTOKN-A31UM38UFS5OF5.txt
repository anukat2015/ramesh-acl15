Title: I love this thing...
Content:
I am very satisfied with the purchase, is one netbook with performance of notebook, by something HP has it in the category of Business. The presentation and chassis in general demonstrate their quality, are not of cheap plastic like those of their competitors. 
The good:  
Slot of expansion x54 (like in one notebook of normal size), in where it can from taking Internet by means of the cellular service, to cards to watch digital TV in the equipment or to use a mogo mouse that hides in the groove and always takes with the equipment. 
It is bluetooth, it does not need any additional hardware.
 Cards Network Wireless N and 10/100/1000 Gigabit 
Screen of 10,1 Inches 
Work without overheat 
The bad: 
The resolution of the screen (1024 xs 576) take 14 pixels to the standard of (1024 xs 600), this acquittal a little space of vertical work and some times the windows of I engage in a dialog will appear incomplete, in programs that have their interfaces designed for the standard resolution of 1024x600 
Have a USB port of each side, and some peripheral  demand 2 USB Plugs to work, this can be in a disadvantage, and although one of those ports is of a new type "re harnessed" that even brings the logo: USB +, I have not been able to find a cable for that new type of connector with which HP solve the problem. It is possible to mention that all the peripheral ones that I have proven they work well in this even single connector being fed by one USB Plug.  
In summary, I found but good things that bad in this equipment, its design and elegance and the quality that reflects, extra their yield (it compares it with Acer One executing Word 2007, and the HP before opened it as by 4-5 seconds) makes of the HP an equipment far beyond my seem.

Title: Excellent camera
Content:
Takes supior pictures. Sharpness and color very good. Easy to approach still maintaining the many options such a camera should have. The only drawback I have noticed - it will take picture immediately when you push the shutter to the bottom even if it has not finished perfect focus. 
I have just upgraded to this camera from Nikon D70 and is very satisfied the camera is worth every cent.

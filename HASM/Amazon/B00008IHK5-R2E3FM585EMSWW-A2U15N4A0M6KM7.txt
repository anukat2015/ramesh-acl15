Title: Good value for the money
Content:
It took a little getting used to since its not fully automated, but the coffee brews well. You just have to be careful when you pour the water in that it ends up where its supposed to go (versus on the counter or in the coffee grinds). The coffee decanter doesn't work well for pouring the water in. I ended up filling the decanter for the amount of water I needed, transferring the water to a (large) measuring cup, and pouring it in from there. 
Also be aware that the top opens up for putting in the water and the grinds, so be sure to allow more than the 14" height for clearance when you are preparing your coffee. I haven't tried the scheduling feature yet.
All in all, a very good value for the money. I would buy it again.
Also, it was delivered in about 10 days, so nowhere as long as was indicated at the time on the Amazon site (60 days). The site has since been updated :)

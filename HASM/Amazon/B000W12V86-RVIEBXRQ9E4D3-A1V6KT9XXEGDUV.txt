Title: Nice computer, but one serious problem
Content:
Overall, I like the 9620.  The display looks better than previous iterations of this machine, and applications run smoothly with the default 2 GB of RAM.  There aren't a lot of excess factory-installed applications, and I got the operating system to where I wanted it within an hour.
The serious problem?  The right shift key is tiny - you can see it in the photos.  There is also a second set of cursor keys next to the shift key, so I often hit them by accident while typing.  I've never seen this setup before - it's an ergonomic nightmare, and almost worth returning the computer.

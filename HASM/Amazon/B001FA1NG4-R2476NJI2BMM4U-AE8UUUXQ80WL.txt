Title: Ipod Accessibility
Content:
I originally owned an ipod Classic, and had no idea that the 4th gen Nano would come out that same year with accessibility features. I finally decided to get one after I sold my Classic a few weeks ago.
It was fairly easy to set up with Itunes. I had to get some help registering, and I was able to do the rest. To enable the spoken feature you have to make sure that, "enable spoken menus for accessibility "is check when you plug the Ipod in. Next time you sink, audio files are created with names of artist's albums, and songs as well as most menu items. Also, make sure you go into speech in control panel to select the voice. The only menu items that don't speak are most of the extras and the clock. I have other ways of finding out the time anyways. I believe Itunes updates the clock on the Ipod.
 Not only is this helpful for the visually impaired, but it's useful if you are driving, or if you don't want to look at the screen all the time.
I have some vision so I ordered the 16 GB, shiny, purple one. The battery life is great because I don't do anything else but listen to music. I also disabled the backlight and cover flow. I would have no use for them for the most part anyways. :)
You don't have to be restricted to buying your music from Itunes. i use the Amazon MP3 store, and import the tracks in to Itunes. I keep all my music in the same folder. That way, Itunes can add just the folder I specify.
Apple has done a great job with making accessible products from what I heard, and i hope they continue. Right now I own the Ipod Nano, and so far it has been great!

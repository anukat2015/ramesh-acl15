Title: Buy the Breeze - you won't regret it!
Content:
I love love love this vacuum. It's light, has all the attachments I like (small brush, large brush, crevice). Bagless, and easy to empty canister. Does great on hardwood floors, and even on tough jobs. (This is not the vacuum for you if you have a lot of carpet. It works fine on low-pile though). The reason I wrote this review is because of how versatile this machine is. Today we were sanding exposed beams in our 20 foot high attic, and this vacuum worked like a charm to get the beams clean! It comes with a strap so you can sling it across your back and go anywhere with it. I purchase this vacuum because my grandmother has it - it's a great size for older people as well, because it's not too heavy, and they can maneuver it easily.

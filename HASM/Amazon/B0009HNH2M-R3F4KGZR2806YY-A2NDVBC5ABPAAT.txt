Title: Conventional Vacuum
Content:
It was hard to locate a conventional canister vacuum at electronics and hardware stores with the evolution and popularity of filterless upright models.  The Hoover canister vacuum is what can be expected from conventional technology.  It is simple to use, works powerfully, and is just as reliable as any new reengineered product.

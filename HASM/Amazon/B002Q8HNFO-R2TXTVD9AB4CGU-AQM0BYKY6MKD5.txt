Title: Love this laptop!
Content:
I had never heard of ASUS, but a computer savvy friend recommended it, so I bought it. This is a sweet little machine! The screen is bright, the processor speed is excellent; everything about this laptop is good.
The only negative is regarding the $100 rebate. There was no information included with the computer or from Amazon about how to apply for the rebate. I had to email Amazon asking about it. They wrote back immediately telling me what I needed to mail and where to send it. When I sent the materials in, it came back as undeliverable to that address. So I went online for ASUS USA, and finally got the correct information. But that has nothing to do with the laptop itself. 
Get this laptop. You won't regret it.

Title: Best computer I ever had
Content:
This is the best computer I ever bought. I stopped using Macs after buying the Apple IIc (a long, long time ago in a galaxy far away) but when I saw the 17&quot; I thought it was perfect.I runs great and is perfect for business when you want a desktop replacement product.The only problem with it is the weight which sometimes is exhausting when carrying around for a complete day or on business trips. But that's a small price to pay when compared with the incredible benefits it provides.

Title: Couldn't Believe It--Outstanding Product
Content:
We have a weekend cabin--unfinished--in Brehnam, Texas.  Because the cabin is pier and beam, and lacks insulation, climate control is an issue in both the summer and winter.  We went through probably a dozen heaters before trying this one.  I was at the end of my rope, and the ONLY reason I gave this heater a shot is because of some of the reviews.  The thing looks like a knick knack, and I couldn't imagine it working where some much more industrial-looking units had failed.  Boy was I WRONG.  It worked so well last winter that we bought another one this year--then we had to turn one off because it got too HOT (temp outside was in the 20s).  
One thing to remember with any heater is that it must be size-appropriate for the room you are using it in.  We use ours in the loft of our cabin, which is roughly 14'x16', with a barn roof that reaches about 7' in the middle.  
We've found the thermostat to be hugely helpful in keeping us from overheating--set it at about 65 or 70 and we're good to go, even in freezing weather.

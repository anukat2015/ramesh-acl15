Title: Good Little Player
Content:
I wasn't too sure about this purchase at first, but after I received it, I am constantly being surprised by its capabilities. It's lightweight and a comfortable fit in a shirt pocket. The price is very fair compared to other mp3 players. 8gb of memory is plenty for my use as i hardly fill it half-way.
Great sound !!
I have not used the included earbuds as I already have a favorite set from another device. The features are too numerous to mention and they are already listed on the decription on Amazon. 
You will need to download the owner's manual and the Itunes software if you don't have it already. The quick start guide supplied with unit is barely enough to get it turned on. The software is not as user friendly as I would prefer but after a few sync sessions it becomes easier. 
All in all it's a good buy.

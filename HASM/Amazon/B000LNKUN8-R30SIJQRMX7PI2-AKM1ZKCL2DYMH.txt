Title: Does exactly what it's supposed to do!
Content:
Ordered this to install in my sunroom (3 season room) to remove the hot air that rises when the sun pours in. Installation is not easy (probably because of the sidewalls in my sunroom) but a contractor friend of mine cut the 6" hole, wired it to a switch, and  mounted it on a box on the sidewall. VOILA! I think it lowers the temperature by at least 5-10 degrees when it's hot in there. Runs quietly also.

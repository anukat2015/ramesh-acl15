Title: F*ck you winter
Content:
I should have bought one of these 4 years ago.  I tend to spend much of my free time at my computer(especially in the winter).  I used to wrap my feet in blankets, although that is more energy efficient than this it would take so long for them to warm up.  With Toasty Toes I turned it on and within a few minuets I have warm feet, and about 15 mins later they are really warm.  I wear a size 11.5US shoe(mens) and my feet this with about 1 inch to spare.  If your feet are bigger than mine there is plenty of room on the sides to angle your feet so they do fit; heck right now I'm warming my feet and drying off my shoes that got wet in the rain today.  If you are really cheap you could turn your heat way down and sit across from your roommate and both of you could share one of these.
The only con.  The plastic doesn't feel super thick so I'm going to return the hammer I bought for putting this through a durability test.
Buy it.

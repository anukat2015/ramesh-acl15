Title: Pleasant surprise...no more
Content:
I ordered this item with some trepidation. I've not had much luck with Sharper Image products. The ad advises extreme caution, all sides get very hot. Not true based on this one unit. I've used with a happy smile for a week...gives off nice heat for such a small item. Not hot sides or back. I use mine on the floor, away from combustionables, and I'm happy. I'd pay a bit more if it had a remote. Neat.
FOLLOW -UP: SPOKE TO SOON. STOPPED WORKING..TRIED OTHER OUTLETS, JUST DIED.

Title: Really awesome for the price!
Content:
This is one of the best mp3 players I had paid for and will keep using it instead of the ipods you can buy more micro sd card to install if you need more room. Worth the money I use it at the gym everyday running on the treadmill keeps me busy and less bored. Quality stays in tack when you are running I say may need to buy new ear phones but they one it comes with is okay.

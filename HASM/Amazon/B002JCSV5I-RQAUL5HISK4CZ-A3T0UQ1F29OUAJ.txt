Title: great beginners camera
Content:
this is a great camera if youre starting in the dsl world. the lens'capability is limited, you have to start thinking about saving up for other lenses depending on your style. the on camera guide is really helpfull the first two to tree sesions, but once you out grow it you dont notice its even there. great purchase.

Content:
I have read a lot of reviews for the zune that have slammed the zune software and the device itself. I have had mine since the release date and have had no problems with it. The software installed just fine and also imported all my playlists and music ratings from WMP11. The player is incredibly easy to use once you get used to it and i am yet to have any issues with the battery life. I have handed the zune to several people and no everyone has figured the interface out very quickly with minimal instruction, it's that easy to use.I won't comment on the zune marketplace because I have no need to use it, i rip my music from actual CD's. All in all i would say this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great media player for a decent price.

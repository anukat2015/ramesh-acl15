Title: Words cannot describe how much I hate this product
Content:
I think the name of this product "featherlite" was an inside joke between engineers/designers, who put this machine together at Dirt Devil. I don't believe the people who think this product is "light" and I are from the same planet. This vacuum feels and sounds more like a lawnmower than something you would use indoors. It doesn't suck well. It stinks up the apartment. The Miele vacuum of my mom's from early 1980s does a better job in every aspect possible. It is also SO big that it requires as large a closet space as most NYC apt. can have. I can't wait to toss it.

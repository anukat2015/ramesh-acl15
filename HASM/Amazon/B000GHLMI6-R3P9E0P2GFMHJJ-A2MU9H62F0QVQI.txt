Title: Buy something else!
Content:
This coffee pot is the worst design ever:
-Water is added in the top at the back of the machine so there is no way to use this under the cabinets.
-After the unit is filled and ready to start brewing, there is no easy way to slide the unit back because of the rubber feet on the bottom. So now you have to pick up the big bulky unit and hope you don't make a mess.
-The coffee level window is obscured by condensation so you have to guess at how many cups are remaining.
- When you open the top to remove the used coffee grounds, hot condensation often falls on your hands.
-Making more than 10 cups of coffee will cause the grounds to "splash up" and get all over the top of the lid, into the fresh water tank.  The tank and lid are connected to the electronics and not removable.  There is no easy way to clean them.
Over 6 cups of coffee and it produces a weak flavor.
My recommendation...buy something else!

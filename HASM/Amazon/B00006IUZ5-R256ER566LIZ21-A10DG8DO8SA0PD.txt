Title: Sunbean Hot Shot
Content:
I had my old Hot Shot for 15 yrs or more and I have to say I liked it much better than the new one.  First they reversed the switches so I have had to get accustomed to that change.  Second, the lid doesn't uncover the whole tank so it is a little bit inconvenient to pour liquid into and to clean.  Third, it didn't come with a matching white cup.  The old one had a matching Almond cup.  But it works, so guess it will be OK!

Title: Best for small spaces with hard floors
Content:
I've had the item for some months now and have gotten a lot of use out of it.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, both bad and good.  It is a powerful little vacuum and works GREAT on hard floors (we have ceramic tile, Pergo, and linoleum).  It's light weight and useful on stairs.  On carpet it can suck up dust and debris, but can't handle hair at all.  The pet hair attachment is super useful, but as soon as the bag gets half full you lack the suction to use it.  
The design is pretty poor.  Cord storage is about as bad as having none at all.  The power button is only convenient if you carry the thing around, which makes the wheels pointless.  The hose and telescopic extension are good lengths, though the quality of the hose is poor.  I've NEVER had a hose that was so flimsy and expect I'll have to replace/repair it in short order.  The cord is a little short for large spaces.  The main body isn't very maneuverable and falls over.  Worst of all is the opening for controlling suction power.  I've never seen anything so pathetic.  It's just a hole with a twist turn cover and even when it's completely closed you can tell there's no seal on it.  Location of it makes it easy to open unintentionally.
Overall I'd say it's great for someone in a small house or apartment with hard floors and a pet.  But if you have kids or carpets you might do better to look elsewhere.

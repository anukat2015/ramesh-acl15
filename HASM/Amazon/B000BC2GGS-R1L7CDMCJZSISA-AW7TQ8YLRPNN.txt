Title: It works
Content:
I have been using this product for about half a month now. All I would say is that it is not that efficient in terms of heating a moderate size room, but is comfortable for a small room. The unit does not get too hot, which is good and the grill remains relatively warm (not hot - which is good too). An effective addition to existing heating appliances, but definitely not a primary source.

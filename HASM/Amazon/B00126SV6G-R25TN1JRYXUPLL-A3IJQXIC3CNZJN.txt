Title: Confusing, then dead
Content:
I got this Zen before I knew that it can only be recharged by plugging in to a computer.  It was supposed to be a gift for someone who did not own a computer (I was going to load it for her), so I wish I had known.  Anyway, decided to keep it for myself and started transferring files...  The software that came with it did not convert my videos properly even though they were in the preferred format.  Much communication with the Creative tech help... They kept referring me to irrelevant articles on their website (like "How to play home videos on your computer") and told me several times to use "Creative Centrale" to transfer my videos.  After much badgering, I finally got them to tell me that Creative Centrale is their software, which by the way is NOT the software that came with the Zen.  On my own, I discovered that using Windows Media Player was perfect for transferring videos to the Zen.  Yay.
So I was all excited to start... The next morning, I grabbed my Zen and plugged it into the computer.  No recognition.  Was it on?  Yes, the indicator light showed that it was on.  Was there anything on the screen?  No, it was blank.  What about turning it off and turning it back on, which works with every other electronic device?  I'll be darned - it would not turn off!  Blank screen, and wouldn't turn off, after 10 days of ownership.  I had to send it back.
Darn.

Title: Excellent Heater
Content:
After waffling on getting a space heater, I finally found this one.  Another reviewer mentioned that the heater has slots that allow the heated air to come out from the sides as well as from the top and that he was returning a more expensive model - that did it for me!  I ordered this one on Wednesday, received it on Thursday, and it's doing a great job of keeping the chill off the living room in the evening.  Considering that we had a chill factor of 4 degrees yesterday, that's pretty good! Looks good, it's very quiet (just a couple of pops as it warms up), and it puts out enough heat to be a welcome place to warm your hands after shoveling snow. 
Right now I'm waiting to see the impact on the electric bill, but if it's as reasonable as others report I'm going to get another one for the bedroom.  Oh, and if you're concerned about an odor when it first runs, don't be.  Although the instructions mention there may be some odor, mine is completely odorless - no problems at all, and I'm pretty fussy.

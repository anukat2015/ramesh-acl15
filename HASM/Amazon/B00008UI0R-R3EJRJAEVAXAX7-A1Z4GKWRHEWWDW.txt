Title: Very Disappointed!
Content:
I had also read all the great reviews which is why I purchased it.  It has caused me nothing but aggravation and now I'm tossing it after just 1 year.  Huge waste of money!  It overheats a lot and has now completely stopped working.  When it worked, I still didn't like it.  Yes, the suction was good, but otherwise I found it cumbersome, heavy, difficult to change attachments, and I had to empty the dirt collection container constantly.  It was a mess!  Also, mine wouldn't vacuum up anything hard.  Even just a piece of string would jam the roller.  Maybe I just had a lemon - but I don't have anything good to say about it!
[Note:  I've never written a review about anything, but I had such harsh feelings about this that I felt compelled.  I also feel bad about writing a bad review, but perhaps I can save someone some money and aggravation.  Besides, I don't think Hoover will suffer in any way from my negativity - so I can write this conscience-free!]

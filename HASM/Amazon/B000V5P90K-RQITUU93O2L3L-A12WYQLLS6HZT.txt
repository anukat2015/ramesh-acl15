Title: Nothing is perfect...but
Content:
For my useage the Canon 40D has been as close to perfect as I've found
so far...I love this camera more with each passing day.  I've only taken a
couple of thousand shots since buying it a few weeks ago, but I'm thinking that I have finally found the 'one' camera I've been looking
so long for...fulfills all my needs, and doesn't fuss at me when I stay out late at night either...lol.

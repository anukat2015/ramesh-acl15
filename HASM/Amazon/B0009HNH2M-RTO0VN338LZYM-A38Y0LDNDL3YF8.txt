Title: Decent if you like canister vacuums
Content:
I had a perfectly good bagless upright, which my girlfriend insisted that I get rid of in order to be replaced by this vacuum. It does a decent enough job, but I'm not used to cannister vacuums so it feels odd. 
Its light and fairly well built. 
So if cannister vacuums are you're deal, nice purchase, but I do prefer bagless uprights, it holds better.

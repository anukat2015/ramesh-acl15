Title: Good Little MP3
Content:
I wanted an MP3 player and considered a number of brands but was looking for something from Creative, just not too pricy. This one offers a color screen which was a plus.  The screen is a little difficult to see in some types of lighting, so consider than when deciding on this MP3. The ability to move from screen to screen is very sensitive to the touch, although you can adjust the sensitivity. You may find from time to time if you touch it too much you move very fast from screen to screen.  Need to be careful with this one.  I have no problem with this MP3 because I have adapted to how it works.  I felt 4GB was sufficient space for the amount of music I wanted to have on the MP3.  I just wanted a good basic MP3 for walking and going to the gym. Downloading of music is a snap, so you should not have any problems with this task.  So far, so good, I have not experienced any major problems with this MP3.

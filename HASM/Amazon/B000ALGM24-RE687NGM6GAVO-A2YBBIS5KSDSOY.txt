Title: Excellent product that auto-magically adjusts between heat & A/C !
Content:
I purchased this product following a recommendation from Consumer Reports and extensively reading consumer comments on Amazon.  We are VERY pleased with the thermostat!  My husband was a little bit anxious on whether he could replace the unit himself (decided to do it on a weekday so that back-up could be called if needed).  He was surprised how easy it was to replace the unit.  
We especially like the automatic change-over between heat and A/C.  Since it's not uncommon in the fall to go from very chilly nights to very warm days, we were constantly shifting the thermostat back and forth.  With this unit, you no longer have to do that.  You simply set your heat temperature for wake-up, leave the house, return home, go to bed, and then do the same with your A/C temperature.  The unit automatically engages the right unit at the right time -- it's amazing!
Also, the unit is very easy to program and does NOT make any noises when it turns on and off.  This is an excellent choice -- you won't be disappointed!

Title: Old faithful farberware
Content:
Farberware FCP280 8-Cup PercolatorAfter going through two of the newer type Farberware percolators in a little over two years, I went back to my old, beatup Farberware (with the hex nut in the bottom).  It lasted quite a number of years but finally quit one morning.  I was afraid to try the newer version again, but felt perhaps they had worked out the "bugs" (such as the "glug-glug" when pouring).  I was pleasantly surprised to find they had updated the pot, along with a new type of cord.  It works as well as the old pot.  Am happy I tried it again.

Title: Snazzy for the money
Content:
I am totally digging this ride. I'm switching from an iBook, and while sad to see my Mac go, I am tickled with this machine. It feels solidly built. The keyboard style is new to me but it's very easy to use. It's very quiet. The facial recognition login is a hoot--and works! I was bummed to see that the outer case shows fingerprints almost as much as the interior. I typically don't like shiny screens, but this one really doesn't bother me. It feels very crisp. 
Props to Amazon for getting this to UPS just a couple hours after I ordered it and to me the very next day.

Title: Suitable, fits some needs, but falls short in others.
Content:
This coffee maker is over-priced, but it is a quality product.  If my frustrations below were corrected, it would have  earned a 5 instead of a three.  It is ideal for the person who enjoys an occasional cup of freshly ground coffee, without a need to make 2-12 cups at one time.
One is suppose to be able to adjust the coarseness of the coffee, but turn after turn of the dial to adjust the coarseness yielded little difference.  Eventually, I stripped the knob, after only about 4 sessions, trying to make the beans more coarse.
A major of frustration is a single line in the manual that left me misunderstanding how the grind feature worked.  The manual indicated, "... add the right amount of beans."  What does that mean?  It led me to believe that I had to add the appropriate amount of beans given the number of cups I wanted to make.  Which, I just figured out is not the case at all.  You basically fill the hopper to the top and it grinds the number of beans based upon how much water you put in and whether you want mild or strong coffee.  Outside of that one line in the manual, I applaud the company for the simple instructions in the manual.

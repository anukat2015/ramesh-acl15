Title: Excellent camera for all users
Content:
This camera is easy to use yet has the functions of a pro level DSLR.  Tilt screen is large and clear coupled with the live view it has been very helpful since I broke my wrist.  Pictures are clear and very sharp.  If you have old Minolta AF lens like I do it was an easy decision as to what camera to choose.  Was almost going to choose a Canon but found out in time that their Live Veiw could not be used in manual mode.
In Short this camera is an excellent choice for all levels of experience however the a550 "might" be of more appeal if you have the extra 200.00 to spend.

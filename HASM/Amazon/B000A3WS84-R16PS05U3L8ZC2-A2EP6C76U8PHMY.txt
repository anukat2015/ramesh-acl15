Title: Great warranty!
Content:
I bought my new iPod in April 06 after my Mini was stolen out of my locker during one of my high school Water Polo games. A few days ago, I stepped on it, and there was an airsoft pellet under it, and it dented the back, killing the hard drive. I went to the closest Apple store, and within 5 minutes, I left with a brand new replacement iPod at no cost to me. Since is was technicaly my fault, I should have had to pay a large fee. Luckily, I discussed my problem face-to-face with a person. If I sent it through the mail to Apple to be fixed, it would have cost a lot of money. If yours ever breaks, just find the nearest Apple store.

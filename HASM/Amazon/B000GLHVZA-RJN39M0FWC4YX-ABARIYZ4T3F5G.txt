Title: Great heater.  Quiet opperation and stays cool to the touch.
Content:
Purchased to use in our daughter's room to help keep her warmer while sleeping.  Within just a few minutes it's noticeably warmer in the room.  Does a great job at keeping the space at the desired temperature, she's been very satisfied. We like that the space heater does not get hot to the touch and runs very quietly.  We've used heaters in the past that got very hot and the click as they turned on/off would wake us up, not with this unit.  It was recommend to us by some friends who own two of them. We've been equally as pleased.

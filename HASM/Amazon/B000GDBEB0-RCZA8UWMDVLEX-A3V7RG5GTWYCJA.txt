Title: Shuts off all the time!
Content:
As other reviewers have noted, you should avoid this product at all costs. It shuts down all the time. I've tried connecting this to a line conditioner and it helped a bit but the unit still randomly just turns off. Don't make the same mistake and buy another brand of air conditioner.

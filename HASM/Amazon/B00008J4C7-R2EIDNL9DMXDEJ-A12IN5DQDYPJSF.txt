That would be my choice for this product.  Worst thing I have spent money on in a very long time.  The brush roller does not rotate, and it does not pick up even the smallest bit of fuzz.  With a Lab and a Rotti dog that sheds enough to clothe a small village, I need a vacuum that actually does what it claims it will do.  If you are in the same kennel as I, please do not waste your money on this item.

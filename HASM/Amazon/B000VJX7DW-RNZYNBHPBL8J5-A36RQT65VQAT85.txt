Title: Sayonara to L glass
Content:
I owned both the Canon Rebel XTi and 40D with 24-70 F2.8 L and 70-200 F4 IS L and just used them as a casual amateur photographer.  I was very happy with the images they produced.  I was even strongly considering the 5D when along came the D300 w/ 18-200 VR lens.  We all know Canon and Nikon regularly leapfrog each other.  But I seriously believe 2008 is Nikon's year.  I compared the image results from the 40D and D300 and the latter just trumped the 40D hands-down on every aspect.  It was close to film quality.  Colors were more vivid, ergonomics are MUCH better, a rockin' LCD screen, dust and weather sealing, 51 AF points, 100% viewfinder coverage, vital controls like flash exposure compensation are not buried in the menu, ISO 1600 images with little decrement in quality, etc. Taking photographs is lots of fun with this bad boy.  Another big reason for the switch was the 18-200 VR lens.  Instead of changing lenses and risking dust to get in the sensor, I just leave this lens on and it does most everything I've ever wanted in a walkaround lens.  One downside is that my Canon buddies have labeled me a "traitor," and always give me a hard time for it, but I can live with that.

Title: Great Camera BUT...
Content:
The new Canon 40D is more than great, good quality pictures, and all those sweet features that you can read in other reviews. 
I absolutely love my 40D, but I gave it 4 stars because of one thing. DUST! 
It's amazing how much dust can the camera get! Every time I go out shooting, when I get back home I have to open it an blow some dust out.
I believe it is because the EF 28-135mm, the lens doesn't seal the camera well enough. 
Other than that, this is a fantastic camera, read other reviews... and buy it! If you can find it..

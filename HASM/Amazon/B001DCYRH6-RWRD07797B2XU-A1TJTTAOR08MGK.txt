Title: Very clever little machine.
Content:
After decades of keeping house and purchasing vacuum cleaners, I think I've found one that's almost ideal. I've had the Hoover Portapower for a couple of weeks and am well satisfied with its convenience and power.  I use it almost daily to clean up after a retired husband, two cats and a dog.  For years I've bought small canister vacuums for the non-carpeted rooms of our house because they were lightweight, and for years I've struggled with wands that fall apart while I'm vacuuming, short cords, machines that topple over when pulled and/or skin the paint off the woodwork, miniscule bags, low suction, cheap attachments,mega-decibel motors and motors that just plain quit. (Maybe I'm lucky these things didn't happen all at the same time!) So far, this little Hoover has not exhibited any of these shortcomings.  The price was moderate, and delivery was super fast (three days and I had my vacuum).  I love the extra-long cord.  The only drawback I find with the Hoover Portapower is not its fault:  I have small hands (ring size 5), and I find the hand grip a little too large to be really comfortable for me.  Otherwise, I'm happy to give this vacuum 5 stars.  (By the way, I've just ordered one for my son.)

Title: Should you upgrade?  Heck yah!
Content:
After less consideration than I probably should have given such a big purchase, I decided to upgrade from my Canon 20D to the Canon 40D shortly after it was announced.  Let me start out by saying that I haven't been disappointed by my rash decision; Canon has improved so many aspects of the camera since the 20D (two models ago) that it's definitely worth upgrading if you're using a 20D or earlier.  For those of you with 30D's, that might be a harder decision as fewer things have changed.
Without trying to be too wordy, let me list a few of my favorite new or improved features over the 20D (in no particular order).
- Huge, beautiful LCD screen makes it much easier to see and show others your photos.
- Playback mode now lets you see the RGB histogram as well as the traditional luminance one.
- Hitting the info button twice shows an enlarged and easier to read/understand view on the main LCD of the data normally shown on the top LCD.  For example, when switching metering modes, it lists the name (spot, center weighted, etc.) in addition to showing the symbol.
- Much improved menu system which is better organized and easier to navigate.
- Custom menu which you can populate with those items you use the most (I *love* this feature).
- Three custom modes on the mode dial which you can pre-set as you desire.
- Much hyped live view mode which lets you compose photos with the LCD screen is actually pretty useful for macro work, or any shot which you want to focus manually.  You can zoom up to 10x to focus precisely on a certain region.
- Can you say six and a half frames per second! Wow!
- ISO is now displayed in the viewfinder which makes it easier to see when you've left it on 1600 by accident.
- A new auto ISO mode is included which attempts to choose an ISO fast enough so you can handhold the camera.  One less thing to worry about when shooting in situations where you don't have time to mess with the ISO setting.
- Beautiful grain on the images - I like the way the grain (noise) looks better than the 20D.
- Ultrasonic dust shake off system for reducing sensor dust.  I still have managed to get a few flecks of dust which won't come off, but after taking 5000 photos with many lens changes in the wild, it's not nearly as bad of a problem as on the 20D.
- Improved autofocus system is more accurate than before.
- 14 bit RAW files!  This gives you many more gradations to work with than 12 bit (16,384 per channel instead of 4,096).
I'm sure there are many other things I've forgotten.  I've been using the camera now for over a month, taken 5000 shots, and love it!
There are still a few things missing about this camera which I wish Canon had addressed.
- Still can't use infrared shutter releases with this model.  Canon lets you use these with the consumer oriented digital rebels, so why not on the 20, 30, and 40D models?  Go figure.
- Optional wireless file transmitter / GPS connection, but why not just build wireless into the camera?
Go upgrade before your old camera is worthless!  You can still sell the old one now before too many people get the new ones.

Title: Pretty Good
Content:
I bought this laptop about a month ago now. I thought is was a very reasonable price compared to other laptops with the same specs. It arrived in perfect condition. Works great so far, there was a lot of ASUS software that I would never use, so I removed it; freed up quite a bit of space. I have noticed that while on the charger, when you have the laptop to stay on for more than an hour and it goes idle, sometimes the cursor will be very jumpy for about a min when you start to use it again. After changing the power settings for the comp to go idle in less time this issue has disappeared. Other than that, worth the money.

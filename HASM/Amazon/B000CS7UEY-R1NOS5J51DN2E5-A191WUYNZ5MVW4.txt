Title: I love it and can't function without it
Content:
I'm no MP3 player buff but I did a lot of research before I bought this and I can say that I am absolutely happy with my purchase. I cannot recommend this enough to people who aren't too fond of IPod's. I've always been a Creative Labs fan and really love their sound cards and the audio quality of this player is great. I put all of my CD's on this thing and have about 10 GB's left. The thing I don't like about IPod is that whole copyrighted/protected music thing.  Whenever I rip music to my hard drive I always want it to be MP3. Less snags y'know. I like things to be simple because when your ripping your entire CD collection to your hard drive it should be as painless as possible. Creative makes it easy enough to do that too. I don't use it hardly at all for videos. I have put movies on it before but the whole process takes too long. It has nothing to do with Creative though. I bet if you have a lot of YOUTUBE stuff it would work great. The screen on this little thing is awesome too. I wish there were more downloadable content for it though so that you could have more choices to customize it. but if you want you could put your own photos as the background. And the photos look terrific on this too by the way. I love how it will sycnhronize your music on your hard drive with the player itself too. There's just too many thing I like about this player to sit here and type it all.

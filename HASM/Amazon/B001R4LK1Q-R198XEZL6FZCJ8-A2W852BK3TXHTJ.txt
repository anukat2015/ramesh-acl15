Title: I am so happy I got it! WE LOVE IT!
Content:
I bought this coffee maker to replace ours because I can't stand the burn coffee flavor it bothers me if the glass carafe is not perfectly clean and shiny, and I also like how it looks. 
I was a little scared because I read some negative reviews about the product but OMG I love this coffee maker, it is perfect and does not make a mess at all, it is very easy to clean, use, and I think it is really nice looking :)
It also makes ice coffe if you put ice in the water reservoir. 
I love that the coffee tastes fresh and you can't tell is been there for 4 hours. 
I love to pour the coffee into my cup! No mess! 
Super easy to use.
I really recomed it!!! You would love it! I like it so much that I got another one for my mother after I had mine for a month. 
Great Buy!

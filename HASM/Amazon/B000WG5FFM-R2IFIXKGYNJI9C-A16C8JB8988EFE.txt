Title: Good, but better options available
Content:
I bought a Zune to replace an iPod that I lost. Bad decision! The battery seems to go out right away, and I never use the Wifi for anything - so I feel a bit like I paid for something I'll never use. 
In the end, I bought a new iPod, and have been much happier with it.

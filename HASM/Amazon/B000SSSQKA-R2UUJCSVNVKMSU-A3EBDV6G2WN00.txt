Title: Suction sucks - and not in a good way!
Content:
I purchased this based on several reviews I read saying the suction was wonderful.  I personally think it stinks.  It seems to go "OK" from carpet to floor, but you are supposed to adjust a button on the vacuum head which is on the floor, so you either have to bend down to switch from floor to carpet, or you have to pull it up to you, risking damage in a small home like mine.  The first day it sucked up the bird seed in our house just fine (we have 8 birds).  The next several times I used it, it just pushed the seed around.  Turns out there is a little suction hole on the vacuum head (underside) that regulates how fast the brush turns based on how much suction goes through.  Well, it got filled with bird seed which should have increased the suction, but it didn't, it just pushed the seed around.  I had it two weeks and sent it back.  I recommend you stay away from this cheap product.  FYI, head brush is NOT motorized!  But will move based on suction.

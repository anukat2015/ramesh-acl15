Title: HEATER/FAN CERAMIC DIRECT WIRE
Content:
Nice looking product. Installed this in an 1988 Samurai that had an alternator upgrade so there was no problem. It's nice to start the Sammy on cold mornings, flip on the HEATER/FAN CERAMIC DIRECT WIRE and run back in the house for 5-10 minutes while the engine warms. And because the heat given off by this is instant, the inside warms up nicely. I was wishing for perhaps a little more output, but it has enough and more than those little ones you plug into your cig lighter. The direct wiring to the battery may throw off some people not so mechanically inclined.

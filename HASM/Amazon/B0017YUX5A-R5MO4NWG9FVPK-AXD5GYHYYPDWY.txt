Title: effective but clunky
Content:
I bought this item after owning an upright for over 10 years because I wanted more flexibility as we have both carpet and wood floors.  The main tool can be used for both hard floor and carpet and works well, but I prefer to use the hard floor tool for the wood floors.  The main problem is that the long extension tube doesnt stay locked well and is constantly collapsing when I use it on the carpet.  Also, the hose isnt too flexible and makes carrying and using the vacuum a little  awkward.  Otherwise a good vacuum for the price.

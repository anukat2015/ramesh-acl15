Title: Almost Silent Radiant Heater - Perfect for Bedrooms or Quiet Spaces
Content:
We've been using this panel heater in our 16' x 20' bedroom for 6 weeks to save big $$ by turning the central heating way down at night.  It works very well to heat the room throughout the night and is virtually silent.  There are some tiny expansion noises when it is heating up, but it has never made any noise to waken us during the night and we are light sleepers.  Just need to turn it on about a half-hour before bed to warm up the room.  The room stays pleasantly warm even on the 750W low power setting with the built-in temp control turned less than half-way to max.  It heats without moving air around (no fans) so it takes a while to distribute the heat.  Folks who want instant blowing heat may not like it but they will have to tolerate fan noise.  For us, silence is golden and this heater provides silent heat which is fully adjustable.  It is also light weight and moves easily by either carrying (has built-in handle) or rolling on the supplied casters.

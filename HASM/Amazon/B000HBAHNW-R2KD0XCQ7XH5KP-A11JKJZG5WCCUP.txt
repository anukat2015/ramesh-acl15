Title: Would buy it again
Content:
I bought my Miele about six months ago, after much agonizing over the steep price tag. So far, I'd say it was well worth it. This vacuum has great suction, yet somehow manages to be relatively compact and light-weight. The two brush attachments really do have different functions/uses, and although it's a bit of a pain to change them when going from carpet to hard wood floors and vice versa, they each do a great job.  The other on-board attachments are on the small side, but adequate.
The bags are expensive, but each one goes a long way. I love how quiet this vacuum is, and how there's no vacuum-y odor in the house after I use it. I'm really happy with it and would buy it again.

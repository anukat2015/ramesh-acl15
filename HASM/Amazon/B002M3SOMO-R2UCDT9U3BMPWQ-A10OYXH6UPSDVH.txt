Title: What was Apple thinking - they weren't
Content:
I am an owner of the 2nd gen shuffle.  I can use any headphones I want.  The controls stay stationery when I run.  I don't know what Apple was thinking when they designed this new generation.  You have to use Apple's crummy headphones.  Obviously someone who is an avid athlete had NO input into the design of this product.  Try and find a used 2nd gen shuffle if you really want a great product to run with.  Who knows maybe Apple will get it right with a 5th generation product - gee we can only hope.

Title: Farberware FCP240 2-4 cup Percolator
Content:
Top quality product that completes brewing cycle very quickly and keeps coffee hot. 
Water filled to the top line provides 2 large mugs of coffee.
Bought first percolator (8-10 cup size) 40 years ago and was so satisfied that I bought same model when time came to replace the first pot. 
Then tried $10 Poly-Perk a couple of times but was not really pleased with the plastic construction and shorter life of heating element, so went back to Farberware for the 2-4 cup model about 15 years ago. Just bought second replacement for it, so average life has been about 5 years.

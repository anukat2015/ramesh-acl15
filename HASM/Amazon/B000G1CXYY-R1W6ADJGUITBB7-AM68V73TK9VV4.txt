Title: Great little heater...fast shipment!
Content:
DeLonghi DCH1030 Ceramic Heater Product arrived early.I ordered it Oct.5th and it arrived the 7th.It was packed well and obviously a new item.I read the directions even though it seemed easy to operate I always look at directions.Now I knew how to operate it properly.This heater does have an on off switch.It works just wonderful for small areas and taking off the chill quickly.I am using it now and the room is very warm.If it makes alot of noise I am not noticing it.It is just background hum to me.If nothing else it will be a good reminder to turn it off when I go downstairs.I am happy with this little heater.

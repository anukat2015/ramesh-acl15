Title: The description forgot to mention that you MUST drain the water
Content:
I bought this AC unit during the excess heat wave this summer.  The unit, (once properly vented) works really well for cooling my bed room but it shuts off when the water needs drained.  Durning these hot temperatures this is after only 2-2.5 hrs.  Draining the water is not an easy task because the drain is only 1 inch from the floor so you can only use a really really shallow dish. It does come with a hose to connect to a drain for continous drainage but the drain must be below or at the same level as the AC unit. 
This drainage problem makes the unit NOT useful for long term cooling (you can't run it all night or use it to cool while at work)
As a long term solution I am working on buidling a stand to set the unit on for continous drainage into a bucket but it is heavey and vibration makes noise a problem. Other portable AC unit have a collecting bottle which is easy to revome for drainage.

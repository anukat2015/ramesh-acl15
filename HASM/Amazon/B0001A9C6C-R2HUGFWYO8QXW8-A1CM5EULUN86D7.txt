Title: i-pod mini is the best
Content:
The i-pod mini is compact, and easy to use.  The software is also very easy to use.  I can download an entire album in under 30 seconds.  It is awesome!  The only bad thing is that the earbud headphones sometimes come out of my ears. In my mind, the problem is a small price to pay for the excellent sound that comes out of them.  Overall, this is a very good product.  Well worth the cost.

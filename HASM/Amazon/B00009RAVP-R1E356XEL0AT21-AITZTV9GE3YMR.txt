Title: Works well
Content:
I bought this item to provide efficient space heating.  I use it in short bursts to keep me warm, and it does that job well.  The heat feels like standing in front of a fireplace. It doesn't seem to heat the entire room, but maybe if you ran it longer it would.  I like it.

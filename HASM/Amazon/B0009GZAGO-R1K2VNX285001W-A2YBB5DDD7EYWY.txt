Title: The camera I wish I bought
Content:
Before getting a digital camera, I used a 35MM Nikon for many many years. When I decided to finally get a digital camera though, I bought a compact Sony camera and while it was easy to carry around it wasn't the best quality. This is the camera I wish I bought and it's the one my nephew has. He loves it, and I will too as soon as I can afford to buy it.

Title: Not a whole room heater!
Content:
I bought this as a christmas gift for my boyfriend to use in his bedroom. Mainly because it is cost efficient and doesn't take up any floor space. Being very excited to install it, it was a big let down. I've read all the reviews on here and that is why I end up paying so much for this little thing. First, we left it on for hours and the room was still cold! Then,we leave the central heater on and have this on and after the central heater gets turned off, this does not keep the room cozy whatsoever. How it heats up a whole room (ours was 9x9) is beyond me. For the same amount of money, you can buy yourself a nice radiator instead. Please save yourself the money and time. This thing does not work.
Pros:
- You can place your hands 5 inches from it to warm up
- probably saves you energy (because it doesn't heat up)
Cons:
- does not heat up a room
- really heavy, be sure you mount it on your wall where there is support
- way too expensive for what not doing what it claims

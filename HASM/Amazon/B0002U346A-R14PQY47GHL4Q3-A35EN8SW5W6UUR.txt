Title: I like my little vacuum cleaner
Content:
I searched the Internet for a long time to find a vacuum cleaner that would work for me.  It needed to be VERY compact (my home is small with very little storage space), lightweight, and have a heppa filter.  And not too expensive!  Finding this one was a miracle.  It works very well, takes up little space, and was affordable.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that, like most canister vacuums, if I pull too hard it tips over which can be a pain when moving around the house.

Title: Best low-end machine on the market
Content:
I've had this machine for about six years, and I remain impressed by the durability and quality of it.  It's survived almost twenty moves, five of which were cross-country.  The only thing that's not in like-new condition on the machine is the lid to the espresso carafe, as the small plastic tabs that provide tension to keep it on the carafe broke off.  
Please note the title of my review, though.  If you are expecting coffeehouse quality out of a machine, invest in another one.   I had this one in college and law school and it is about to be replaced by a La Pavoni Europiccola simply because the taste on this machine isn't the grade I like.  If you aren't drinking espresso daily, however, this machine is probably more than what you need.  Be realistic- if you want coffehouse quality, you're going to have to invest in coffehouse-grade machines, none of which cost $100 for a dual-function unit.
Besides taste, another issue is the frothing mechanism on this, which is quite functional but has a fairly significant learning curve.  A reviewer below complained that there was not enough steam to froth the requisite amount of milk, for example.  This is not true- there is more than enough steam- but you have to stand over the machine and learn when it's ready to go. In my experience, this is largely by sound and feel.  Once you get the hang of it, it's fine, but don't expect to pick it up the first time you use it, or if it's a machine you use only sporadically.
Bottom line: If you're looking for an affordable, attractive machine that makes low to mid-grade espresso, cleans easily, and has a small footprint, this is the one.

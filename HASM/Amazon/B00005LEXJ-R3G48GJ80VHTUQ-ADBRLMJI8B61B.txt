Title: Common sense selection
Content:
I have a 12x12 wooden shed (uninsulated) with an upper deck for storage.  I use the shed for a small business that I own and operate.  I am dead in the center of Kansas and we have mild to somewhat severe winters.  Yesterday (October 30), our low was 28 degrees.  I fired up Mr. Heater; turned it on high, and one hour later, it was workable in the shed.  Around 55 degrees.  And, as I worked, it continued to rise until I shut it down to low about 30 minutes later. I read reviews where owners leave their units on all night.  I cannot imagine doing anything like that.  After all folks, we're talking about a flame on top of a propane canister.  Just my hangup I guess, but I digress. 
My point is this:  don't expect a single top propane heater to perform miracles, i.e. heat my 12x12 shed from 28 degrees to 70 degrees in 15-20 minutes.  Ain't going to happen.  However, I am very satisfied with this unit as I researched enough heaters to know what to expect.  Now, if I had gone with the double or triple top unit, it would merit a different review with different rexults, would it not?
I thought I was ordering the model with the electronic start as stated in the description, but the unit I received must be started manually.  No big deal, but if you are ordering, just be advised that you will need to light the unit by hand.
In all honesty, before I would order a double top, I would go with an additional single top on another tank as I feel I could control the temp in my shed much better.
